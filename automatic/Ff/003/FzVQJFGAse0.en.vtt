00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
like I took me some time myself to

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:10.720 
like I took me some time myself to
figure<00:05:09.680> that<00:05:09.919> out<00:05:09.980> because<00:05:10.190> I'm<00:05:10.400> just<00:05:10.520> not

used to using at all defend and that
much<00:05:14.660> like<00:05:14.900> not<00:05:15.050> many<00:05:15.169> games<00:05:15.380> require<00:05:15.800> you<00:05:15.980> to

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
much like not many games require you to

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.140 
do it this exceptionally does this also
like<00:05:18.740> cancelling<00:05:19.400> attacks<00:05:19.729> becomes

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
like cancelling attacks becomes

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.930 
like cancelling attacks becomes
important<00:05:20.750> um<00:05:20.960> you<00:05:21.560> can<00:05:21.770> counter<00:05:22.220> them<00:05:22.430> if<00:05:22.760> you

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
important um you can counter them if you

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.420 
important um you can counter them if you
hit<00:05:23.180> when<00:05:23.479> this<00:05:23.690> blue<00:05:23.900> gauge<00:05:24.139> appears<00:05:24.740> up<00:05:24.979> on

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:25.430 
hit when this blue gauge appears up on

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.240 
hit when this blue gauge appears up on
the<00:05:26.270> attack<00:05:26.540> screen<00:05:26.930> so<00:05:27.560> there's<00:05:28.010> little

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
the attack screen so there's little

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.370 
the attack screen so there's little
different<00:05:28.760> things<00:05:28.940> you<00:05:29.150> can<00:05:29.330> do<00:05:29.540> there<00:05:29.780> like

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 
different things you can do there like

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.909 
different things you can do there like
they're<00:05:31.100> not<00:05:31.370> as<00:05:31.760> easy<00:05:32.720> to<00:05:32.990> pull<00:05:33.200> off<00:05:33.229> because

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 
they're not as easy to pull off because

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:35.980 
they're not as easy to pull off because
you<00:05:34.250> really<00:05:34.640> have<00:05:34.820> to<00:05:35.000> focus<00:05:35.419> in<00:05:35.600> on<00:05:35.750> what

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
you really have to focus in on what

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.260 
you really have to focus in on what
you're<00:05:36.169> doing<00:05:36.200> to<00:05:37.100> hit<00:05:37.310> at<00:05:37.460> those<00:05:37.700> right<00:05:37.970> times

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
you're doing to hit at those right times

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.450 
you're doing to hit at those right times
like<00:05:38.540> I've<00:05:38.930> done<00:05:39.169> them<00:05:39.440> but<00:05:39.800> is<00:05:40.010> it<00:05:40.280> always

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
like I've done them but is it always

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.340 
like I've done them but is it always
like<00:05:40.880> I<00:05:41.060> aim<00:05:41.270> to<00:05:41.510> try<00:05:41.630> to<00:05:41.750> do<00:05:41.930> that<00:05:42.080> every<00:05:42.320> time

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:42.350 
like I aim to try to do that every time

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.529 
like I aim to try to do that every time
but<00:05:42.740> it<00:05:42.830> doesn't<00:05:43.010> always<00:05:43.250> you<00:05:43.910> know<00:05:44.030> happen

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:44.539 
but it doesn't always you know happen

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:47.230 
but it doesn't always you know happen
because<00:05:44.900> it's<00:05:45.110> not<00:05:45.289> just<00:05:45.620> one<00:05:46.520> two<00:05:46.729> three<00:05:47.000> easy

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
because it's not just one two three easy

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.500 
because it's not just one two three easy
at<00:05:47.720> all<00:05:47.930> right<00:05:48.919> so<00:05:49.610> to<00:05:49.669> simplify<00:05:50.330> it<00:05:50.390> a<00:05:50.479> little

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
at all right so to simplify it a little

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.630 
at all right so to simplify it a little
bit<00:05:50.690> I've<00:05:50.990> had<00:05:51.110> to<00:05:51.289> draw<00:05:51.950> an<00:05:52.010> analogy<00:05:52.070> for<00:05:52.550> this

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:52.640 
bit I've had to draw an analogy for this

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.640 
bit I've had to draw an analogy for this

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:25.820 
like the free movement on the

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.040 
like the free movement on the
battlefield<00:06:26.330> because<00:06:26.570> it<00:06:26.690> makes<00:06:26.840> me<00:06:27.020> feel

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.050 
battlefield because it makes me feel

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.500 
battlefield because it makes me feel
like<00:06:27.470> I'm<00:06:27.830> doing<00:06:28.430> something<00:06:28.789> like<00:06:28.940> say<00:06:29.270> here<00:06:29.479> I

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:29.510 
like I'm doing something like say here I

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.719 
like I'm doing something like say here I
can<00:06:29.750> switch<00:06:29.960> to<00:06:29.990> Oliver<00:06:30.500> right<00:06:30.650> now<00:06:30.830> and<00:06:31.310> as

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:31.729 
can switch to Oliver right now and as

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:33.700 
can switch to Oliver right now and as
him<00:06:31.910> I<00:06:32.030> can<00:06:32.210> use<00:06:32.419> you<00:06:32.750> know<00:06:32.780> his<00:06:33.020> spells<00:06:33.320> which

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:33.710 
him I can use you know his spells which

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:35.320

are really

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.659 
are really
but<00:06:35.930> you<00:06:36.139> can<00:06:36.319> also<00:06:36.470> move<00:06:36.830> they<00:06:37.069> can<00:06:37.250> cancel

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:37.669 
but you can also move they can cancel

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:39.129 
but you can also move they can cancel
your<00:06:37.759> attack<00:06:38.150> see<00:06:38.389> how<00:06:38.449> I<00:06:38.479> got<00:06:38.689> hit<00:06:38.900> there<00:06:39.080> and

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:39.139 
your attack see how I got hit there and

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:41.000 
they canceled my attack so it just

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.610 
they canceled my attack so it just
depends<00:06:41.360> on<00:06:41.569> what<00:06:41.780> you<00:06:41.900> want<00:06:42.080> to<00:06:42.169> do<00:06:42.319> now<00:06:42.560> you

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:42.620 
depends on what you want to do now you

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.300 
depends on what you want to do now you

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:46.310 
have options you know different items

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.339 
have options you know different items
you<00:06:46.490> can<00:06:46.669> use<00:06:46.909> you<00:06:47.180> can<00:06:47.210> run<00:06:47.479> away<00:06:47.689> you<00:06:47.750> can<00:06:48.139> set

you can use you can run away you can set

00:06:48.349 --> 00:06:50.709 
you can use you can run away you can set
tactics<00:06:48.889> like<00:06:49.039> I<00:06:49.280> said<00:06:49.490> so<00:06:49.789> you<00:06:49.819> have<00:06:50.270> control

00:06:50.709 --> 00:06:50.719 
tactics like I said so you have control

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:52.629 
tactics like I said so you have control
over<00:06:50.750> her<00:06:51.110> and<00:06:51.289> what<00:06:51.439> she<00:06:51.650> does<00:06:51.860> you<00:06:52.219> know

over her and what she does you know

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:54.969 
over her and what she does you know
that's<00:06:53.150> nice<00:06:53.360> she<00:06:53.810> can<00:06:53.960> do<00:06:54.080> backup<00:06:54.469> whatever<00:06:54.770> I

00:06:54.969 --> 00:06:54.979 
that's nice she can do backup whatever I

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:56.379 
that's nice she can do backup whatever I
never<00:06:55.219> had<00:06:55.340> a<00:06:55.370> problem<00:06:55.699> with<00:06:56.120> the<00:06:56.240> AI

00:06:56.379 --> 00:06:56.389

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:00.800

other<00:07:01.520> than<00:07:01.819> that<00:07:02.090> she's<00:07:02.419> been<00:07:02.659> okay<00:07:02.810> so<00:07:03.500> far

downer<00:07:31.789> note<00:07:32.060> I<00:07:32.270> think<00:07:32.360> that's<00:07:32.629> a<00:07:32.750> good<00:07:32.990> way<00:07:33.050> to

downer note I think that's a good way to

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:35.290 
downer note I think that's a good way to
wrap<00:07:33.560> up<00:07:33.889> this<00:07:34.189> look<00:07:34.430> at<00:07:34.550> the<00:07:34.669> battle<00:07:34.819> system
