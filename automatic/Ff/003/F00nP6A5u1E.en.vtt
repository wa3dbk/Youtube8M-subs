00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:35.840

I 180 you can see again some of the
levels<00:03:14.200> are<00:03:14.530> really<00:03:14.709> easy<00:03:15.159> to<00:03:15.519> get<00:03:15.670> it<00:03:16.540> passed

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
levels are really easy to get it passed

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:23.009 
levels are really easy to get it passed
really<00:03:17.430> would<00:03:18.430> I<00:03:18.549> do<00:03:18.610> this<00:03:21.450> look<00:03:22.450> it<00:03:22.569> slowly

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
really would I do this look it slowly

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:36.520 
really would I do this look it slowly
coming<00:03:23.290> down

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.949 

you<00:03:37.100> can<00:03:37.280> also<00:03:37.430> change<00:03:37.730> calorie<00:03:38.209> creme<00:03:38.660> which

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
you can also change calorie creme which

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:40.449 
you can also change calorie creme which
doesn't<00:03:39.500> really<00:03:39.590> make<00:03:39.770> a<00:03:39.890> difference<00:03:40.130> by

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
doesn't really make a difference by

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:51.540 
doesn't really make a difference by
scrolling<00:03:41.560> it's<00:03:42.560> gonna<00:03:42.800> see

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.230 

what<00:03:52.150> we're<00:03:52.270> doing<00:03:52.510> here

what we're doing here

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.130 
what we're doing here
that's<00:03:54.750> probably<00:03:54.900> a<00:03:55.080> bad<00:03:56.070> choice<00:03:56.400> actually

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
that's probably a bad choice actually

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:04.260 
that's probably a bad choice actually
yeah<00:03:58.140> for<00:03:58.530> so

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:19.030 

I<00:04:04.330> need<00:04:05.080> to<00:04:05.230> be<00:04:05.350> stronger<00:04:05.680> than<00:04:05.890> that
