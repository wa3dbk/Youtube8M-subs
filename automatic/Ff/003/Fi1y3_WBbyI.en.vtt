00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:55.550 
then on pepper in it a lot of people's

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:56.949 
then on pepper in it a lot of people's
Tippett<00:03:55.880> you<00:03:55.970> know<00:03:56.090> last<00:03:56.480> couple<00:03:56.720> of<00:03:56.780> scenes<00:03:56.900> a

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
Tippett you know last couple of scenes a

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:57.940 
Tippett you know last couple of scenes a
lot<00:03:57.080> of<00:03:57.140> people's<00:03:57.350> tip<00:03:57.500> them<00:03:57.650> to<00:03:57.770> and

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
lot of people's tip them to and

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.860 
lot of people's tip them to and
something<00:03:58.130> you<00:03:58.340> know<00:03:58.430> and<00:03:58.610> and<00:03:59.540> i<00:03:59.630> think<00:03:59.660> you

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
something you know and and i think you

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.210 
something you know and and i think you
know<00:03:59.900> they've<00:04:00.410> probably<00:04:00.560> about<00:04:00.740> the<00:04:00.860> cells<00:04:01.070> to

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
know they've probably about the cells to

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.800 
know they've probably about the cells to
as<00:04:01.310> well<00:04:01.430> ease<00:04:01.550> so<00:04:01.880> I<00:04:01.940> don't<00:04:02.000> think<00:04:02.420> them<00:04:02.600> by

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
as well ease so I don't think them by

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.449 
as well ease so I don't think them by
their<00:04:03.320> own<00:04:03.440> standards<00:04:03.890> that<00:04:04.010> live<00:04:04.220> under<00:04:04.400> a

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
their own standards that live under a

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.030 
their own standards that live under a
fart<00:04:04.700> on<00:04:04.880> the<00:04:05.000> pitch<00:04:05.150> it<00:04:05.950> underperformed<00:04:06.950> is

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
fart on the pitch it underperformed is

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.100 
fart on the pitch it underperformed is
the<00:04:07.100> word<00:04:07.220> unlucky<00:04:07.490> for<00:04:07.610> ya<00:04:07.760> so<00:04:08.030> I'm<00:04:08.180> you<00:04:08.990> know

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
the word unlucky for ya so I'm you know

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.230 
the word unlucky for ya so I'm you know
it's<00:04:09.230> I<00:04:09.470> thinking<00:04:10.250> the<00:04:10.610> idea<00:04:10.790> that<00:04:10.820> there<00:04:11.090> for

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:11.240 
it's I thinking the idea that there for

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.790 
it's I thinking the idea that there for
a<00:04:11.270> crop<00:04:11.480> Avenger<00:04:11.810> as<00:04:11.870> well<00:04:12.050> so<00:04:12.230> that<00:04:12.530> doesn't

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
a crop Avenger as well so that doesn't

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.380 
a crop Avenger as well so that doesn't
elbow<00:04:13.010> there's<00:04:13.580> no<00:04:13.670> excuse<00:04:14.000> you<00:04:14.120> know<00:04:14.150> I<00:04:14.300> don't

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
elbow there's no excuse you know I don't

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:15.460 
elbow there's no excuse you know I don't
think<00:04:14.690> you<00:04:14.750> know<00:04:14.870> that<00:04:15.020> they've<00:04:15.380> been

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
think you know that they've been

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.110 
think you know that they've been
training<00:04:15.830> stuff<00:04:16.010> everybody's<00:04:16.580> back<00:04:16.730> in<00:04:16.910> full

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
training stuff everybody's back in full

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.810 
training stuff everybody's back in full
squad<00:04:17.420> so<00:04:17.660> there's<00:04:18.320> no<00:04:18.410> excuses<00:04:18.890> and<00:04:19.040> I<00:04:19.250> think

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
squad so there's no excuses and I think

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:20.920 
squad so there's no excuses and I think
probably<00:04:19.880> good<00:04:20.210> thing<00:04:20.359> for<00:04:20.450> us<00:04:20.540> is<00:04:20.630> just<00:04:20.810> go

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
probably good thing for us is just go

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.260 
probably good thing for us is just go
about<00:04:21.049> better<00:04:21.650> business<00:04:22.070> quietly<00:04:22.370> and<00:04:22.550> we

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
about better business quietly and we

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.610 
about better business quietly and we
come<00:04:23.450> to<00:04:23.600> what<00:04:23.630> we<00:04:23.840> can<00:04:23.990> do

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
come to what we can do

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.219 
come to what we can do
we're<00:04:25.130> very<00:04:25.370> proud<00:04:25.729> that<00:04:25.790> we<00:04:26.120> gained<00:04:26.479> a<00:04:26.750> class

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:27.229 
we're very proud that we gained a class

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:30.790 
we're very proud that we gained a class
status<00:04:27.590> in<00:04:28.130> the<00:04:28.340> licensing<00:04:29.060> fee<00:04:29.500> we've<00:04:30.500> still

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
status in the licensing fee we've still

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.290 
status in the licensing fee we've still
got<00:04:30.919> areas<00:04:31.220> of<00:04:31.310> improvement<00:04:31.550> as<00:04:31.910> well<00:04:32.090> and<00:04:32.240> you

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
got areas of improvement as well and you

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.510 
got areas of improvement as well and you
want<00:04:32.479> to<00:04:32.570> make<00:04:32.690> sure<00:04:32.720> that<00:04:32.960> we<00:04:33.260> maintain<00:04:33.889> our<00:04:34.190> a

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
want to make sure that we maintain our a

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.930 
want to make sure that we maintain our a
class<00:04:34.970> status<00:04:35.300> but<00:04:36.110> also<00:04:36.550> atop<00:04:37.550> the<00:04:37.669> top<00:04:37.820> of

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
the class in all in all happens and I

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:41.740 
the class in all in all happens and I
think<00:04:40.850> it's<00:04:40.970> important<00:04:41.479> for<00:04:41.510> the<00:04:41.720> development

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
think it's important for the development

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.920 
think it's important for the development
of<00:04:42.290> the<00:04:42.410> game<00:04:42.620> the<00:04:43.280> franchising<00:04:43.970> system<00:04:44.360> is<00:04:44.870> a

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
of the game the franchising system is a

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.409 
of the game the franchising system is a
good<00:04:45.260> thing<00:04:45.440> in<00:04:45.620> my<00:04:45.650> in<00:04:46.070> my<00:04:46.130> book<00:04:46.550> I<00:04:46.760> think<00:04:47.270> it

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
good thing in my in my book I think it

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.770 
good thing in my in my book I think it
allows<00:04:47.660> off<00:04:48.080> the<00:04:48.470> field<00:04:48.680> clubs<00:04:49.280> to<00:04:49.780> develop

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
allows off the field clubs to develop
