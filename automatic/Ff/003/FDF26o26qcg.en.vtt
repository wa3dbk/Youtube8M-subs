but make sure that we are just salting
the<00:01:25.200> water<00:01:25.530> but<00:01:26.340> once<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.909> pressure<00:01:27.150> cook

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
the water but once the pressure cook

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.020 
the water but once the pressure cook
they<00:01:28.409> don't<00:01:28.680> observe<00:01:29.070> all<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.370> salt<00:01:29.729> from<00:01:29.940> the
