00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.640 
avoid more avoidable damage than other
tanks<00:01:19.560> who<00:01:20.130> have<00:01:20.250> less<00:01:20.490> avoidance<00:01:21.650> that's

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
tanks who have less avoidance that's

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.200 
tanks who have less avoidance that's
that's<00:01:23.070> good

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
that's good

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.410 
that's good

otherwise known as eh always things call

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.190 
otherwise known as eh always things call
it<00:01:36.060> eh

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
it eh

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.170 
it eh
and<00:01:37.470> what<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:37.979> basically<00:01:38.130> means<00:01:38.460> is<00:01:38.909> that

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
and what it basically means is that

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.969 
and what it basically means is that
effective<00:01:39.930> health<00:01:40.140> is<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.350> amount<00:01:40.860> of

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
effective health is the amount of

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.760 
effective health is the amount of
unmitigated<00:01:41.659> unmitigated<00:01:42.659> damage<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.649> could

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
unmitigated unmitigated damage you could

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.450 
unmitigated unmitigated damage you could
take<00:01:44.360> before<00:01:45.360> you're<00:01:45.570> dead<00:01:45.810> so<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.100> higher<00:01:47.280> it

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
take before you're dead so the higher it

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.249 
take before you're dead so the higher it
is<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.610> more<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:48.060> take<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.509> longer<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.049> live

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
is the more you take the longer you live

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.710 
is the more you take the longer you live
the<00:01:49.710> higher<00:01:50.189> survivability<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:51.000> your<00:01:51.329> raid<00:01:51.509> so

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
the higher survivability of your raid so

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.160 
the higher survivability of your raid so
if<00:01:54.720> you're<00:01:55.079> just<00:01:55.110> doing<00:01:55.680> 10<00:01:56.070> man's<00:01:56.719> it<00:01:57.719> might

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
if you're just doing 10 man's it might

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.550 
if you're just doing 10 man's it might
be<00:01:58.439> worth<00:01:58.920> your<00:01:59.100> while<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.399> go<00:02:00.000> get<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.780> offset

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
be worth your while to go get the offset

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.920 
be worth your while to go get the offset
gear<00:02:01.799> first<00:02:02.070> because<00:02:02.670> it's<00:02:02.880> gonna<00:02:03.090> it's<00:02:03.479> more

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
gear first because it's gonna it's more

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.050 
gear first because it's gonna it's more
Ida<00:02:04.170> it's<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.619> higher<00:02:04.829> Atum<00:02:05.130> level<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:06.479> it's

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
Ida it's a higher Atum level and it's

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.219 
Ida it's a higher Atum level and it's
is<00:02:07.149> technically<00:02:07.600> going<00:02:07.689> to<00:02:07.869> be<00:02:07.930> better<00:02:08.110> for

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
is technically going to be better for

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.130 
is technically going to be better for

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.730 
opinion they get damage mitigation we
just<00:05:44.760> get<00:05:44.880> avoidance<00:05:45.330> and<00:05:45.600> then<00:05:46.200> like<00:05:46.560> you

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
just get avoidance and then like you

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.860 
just get avoidance and then like you
guys<00:05:46.860> all<00:05:47.130> know<00:05:47.370> avoidance<00:05:47.880> is<00:05:48.030> kind<00:05:48.300> of<00:05:48.419> it's

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
guys all know avoidance is kind of it's

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.080 
guys all know avoidance is kind of it's

00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 
in that that time slot that it gives you

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:00.830 
in that that time slot that it gives you
you<00:05:59.400> kind<00:05:59.580> of<00:05:59.640> got<00:05:59.789> fucked<00:06:00.090> for<00:06:00.360> that<00:06:00.479> minute
