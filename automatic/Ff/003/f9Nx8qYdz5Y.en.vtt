each other better than anyone else so

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.539 
each other better than anyone else so
it's<00:01:19.229> really<00:01:19.350> scary<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.830> lose<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.159> kind<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:20.460> a

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
it's really scary to lose that kind of a

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.330 
it's really scary to lose that kind of a
friend<00:01:20.790> someone<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.420> really<00:01:22.140> knows<00:01:22.470> what

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
friend someone that really knows what

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.800 
friend someone that really knows what
you<00:01:23.460> need<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:24.090> what<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.240> want<00:01:24.540> out<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.689> life

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
you need and what you want out of life

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.219 
you need and what you want out of life
um<00:01:25.549> but<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.820> think<00:01:27.180> we<00:01:27.390> actually<00:01:27.540> just<00:01:27.720> shot<00:01:28.110> an

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
um but I think we actually just shot an

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.819 
um but I think we actually just shot an
episode<00:01:28.619> where<00:01:28.920> Danny<00:01:29.520> kind<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:30.170> its<00:01:31.170> it's<00:01:31.680> the

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
episode where Danny kind of its it's the

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.819 
episode where Danny kind of its it's the
big<00:01:31.979> gesture<00:01:32.340> makes<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.670> big<00:01:32.820> move<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:33.829> it

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
big gesture makes a big move and it

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.350 
big gesture makes a big move and it
looks<00:01:35.189> like<00:01:35.250> it's<00:01:35.490> working<00:01:35.549> so<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.060> think

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
looks like it's working so I think

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.810 
looks like it's working so I think
sometimes<00:01:36.780> maybe<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.409> just<00:01:37.560> use<00:01:38.369> go<00:01:38.520> for<00:01:38.729> it

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
sometimes maybe you just use go for it

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.880 
sometimes maybe you just use go for it
tell<00:01:39.030> someone<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.270> feel<00:01:39.600> or<00:01:39.900> why<00:01:40.320> not<00:01:40.439> like<00:01:40.680> that

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
tell someone I feel or why not like that

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.320 
tell someone I feel or why not like that
one<00:01:41.040> we<00:01:41.189> had<00:01:41.280> took<00:01:41.400> movie<00:01:41.790> kiss

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
one we had took movie kiss

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.370 
one we had took movie kiss
think<00:01:42.510> that<00:01:42.660> would<00:01:42.810> be<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:42.960> really<00:01:43.230> good

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
think that would be a really good

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.810 
think that would be a really good
selling<00:01:43.740> point<00:01:43.770> right<00:01:44.250> so<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.400> was<00:01:44.520> gonna<00:01:44.580> say

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
selling point right so I was gonna say

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.310 
selling point right so I was gonna say
do<00:01:45.000> we<00:01:45.090> get<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.330> see<00:01:45.360> anyone<00:01:45.750> profess<00:01:46.140> their

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
do we get to see anyone profess their

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.620 
do we get to see anyone profess their
