00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
different sound it's gonna be presented

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.089 
different sound it's gonna be presented
to<00:01:53.459> us<00:01:53.550> again<00:01:53.789> by<00:01:54.000> younger<00:01:54.270> kids<00:01:55.099> they're

00:01:56.089 --> 00:01:56.099 
to us again by younger kids they're

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:58.100 
to us again by younger kids they're
gonna<00:01:56.250> come<00:01:56.759> from<00:01:56.940> bicycles<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.599> skateboards

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
gonna come from bicycles and skateboards

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.240 
gonna come from bicycles and skateboards
which<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.380> kind<00:01:58.619> of<00:01:58.649> what's<00:01:58.830> happening<00:01:59.160> right

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
which is kind of what's happening right

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.830 
which is kind of what's happening right
now<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.640> think<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.450> evil<00:02:01.170> spirit<00:02:01.500> was<00:02:01.619> born

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.370 
now I think that evil spirit was born
through<00:02:03.840> friends<00:02:04.410> building<00:02:05.039> hot<00:02:05.220> rods<00:02:05.250> in

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
through friends building hot rods in

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.240 
through friends building hot rods in
their<00:02:07.380> garages<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:08.300> my<00:02:09.300> garage<00:02:09.599> became<00:02:10.440> doing

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
their garages and my garage became doing

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.430 
their garages and my garage became doing
with<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.459> most<00:02:11.640> tools

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
with the most tools

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.300 
with the most tools
so<00:02:12.850> the<00:02:13.850> friends<00:02:14.180> used<00:02:14.360> to<00:02:14.480> be<00:02:14.630> there<00:02:14.840> a<00:02:15.530> lot

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
so the friends used to be there a lot

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.710 
so the friends used to be there a lot
and<00:02:16.810> we<00:02:17.810> would<00:02:17.960> work<00:02:18.080> on<00:02:18.290> our<00:02:18.410> stock
