now<00:02:08.960> absolutely<00:02:09.960> not<00:02:10.080> all<00:02:10.380> right<00:02:10.530> number<00:02:10.830> two

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
now absolutely not all right number two

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.800 
now absolutely not all right number two
if<00:02:11.570> Iran<00:02:12.570> was<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:14.010> develop<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:15.090> knowledge<00:02:15.270> for

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
if Iran was to develop the knowledge for

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.530 
if Iran was to develop the knowledge for
nuclear<00:02:16.200> weapons<00:02:16.850> what<00:02:17.850> would<00:02:18.000> be<00:02:18.150> your<00:02:18.180> main

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
nuclear weapons what would be your main

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.470

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
concern that would be me to get I think

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.550 
concern that would be me to get I think
that's<00:02:24.690> why<00:02:24.840> we<00:02:24.959> need<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:25.140> be<00:02:25.290> instead

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560
