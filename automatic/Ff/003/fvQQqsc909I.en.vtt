00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
gone for the gogo and I could have done

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.689 
gone for the gogo and I could have done
good<00:04:22.229> Papa<00:04:23.130> food<00:04:23.310> doesn't<00:04:23.580> make<00:04:23.669> a

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 
good Papa food doesn't make a

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:26.240 
good Papa food doesn't make a
difference<00:04:23.880> I<00:04:24.380> guess<00:04:25.380> the<00:04:25.500> only<00:04:25.560> upside<00:04:25.770> is<00:04:26.130> i

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
difference I guess the only upside is i

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.000 
difference I guess the only upside is i
still<00:04:26.490> have<00:04:26.550> a<00:04:27.199> chart<00:04:28.199> mega<00:04:28.350> charter<00:04:28.710> of<00:04:28.770> i

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
still have a chart mega charter of i

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.610 
still have a chart mega charter of i
left<00:04:29.430> which<00:04:29.669> is<00:04:29.790> cool<00:04:30.060> i<00:04:30.330> get<00:04:30.960> a<00:04:30.990> solar<00:04:31.260> beam<00:04:31.470> up

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.320 
left which is cool i get a solar beam up
or<00:04:31.800> something<00:04:32.160> but<00:04:32.190> not<00:04:32.790> staff<00:04:33.240> who<00:04:33.540> cares<00:04:35.330> so

go<00:04:36.510> to<00:04:36.570> Charizard<00:04:37.110> and<00:04:37.410> I'm<00:04:37.919> hoping<00:04:38.190> it's<00:04:38.370> the

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
go to Charizard and I'm hoping it's the

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.980 
go to Charizard and I'm hoping it's the
last<00:04:38.639> chance<00:04:38.760> I<00:04:39.090> just<00:04:39.240> got<00:04:39.360> hit<00:04:39.479> you<00:04:39.630> hopefully

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
last chance I just got hit you hopefully

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.810 
last chance I just got hit you hopefully
kill<00:04:40.380> you<00:04:40.470> with<00:04:40.590> a<00:04:40.620> solar<00:04:40.950> beam<00:04:41.250> that's<00:04:41.729> the

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
kill you with a solar beam that's the

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.680 
kill you with a solar beam that's the
only<00:04:42.090> thing<00:04:42.210> I<00:04:42.330> have<00:04:42.540> and<00:04:43.370> it<00:04:44.370> is<00:04:44.729> going<00:04:45.240> to<00:04:45.479> go

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
only thing I have and it is going to go

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.830 
only thing I have and it is going to go
down<00:04:45.720> in<00:04:46.410> the<00:04:46.440> HP<00:04:46.919> not<00:04:47.790> nearly<00:04:48.270> fast<00:04:48.630> enough

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
down in the HP not nearly fast enough

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.840 
down in the HP not nearly fast enough
and<00:04:49.260> it<00:04:49.410> doesn't<00:04:49.740> live<00:04:49.889> and<00:04:50.190> that's<00:04:50.490> gonna<00:04:50.669> be

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
and it doesn't live and that's gonna be

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.830 
and it doesn't live and that's gonna be
the<00:04:50.970> end<00:04:51.150> of<00:04:51.240> mega<00:04:51.510> Charizard<00:04:52.080> wise<00:04:52.350> life<00:04:52.710> and

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
the end of mega Charizard wise life and

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.320 
the end of mega Charizard wise life and
consequently<00:04:54.840> as<00:04:55.740> he<00:04:56.130> dies<00:04:56.340> so<00:04:56.940> does<00:04:57.120> my

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
consequently as he dies so does my

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.090 
consequently as he dies so does my
entire<00:04:57.570> match<00:04:57.810> so<00:04:58.080> there<00:04:58.350> you<00:04:58.380> go<00:04:58.440> little

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
entire match so there you go little

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.730 
entire match so there you go little
short<00:04:59.490> one<00:04:59.639> I<00:04:59.850> didn't<00:05:00.360> get<00:05:00.479> to<00:05:00.630> take<00:05:01.020> out<00:05:01.229> the

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
short one I didn't get to take out the

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.909 
short one I didn't get to take out the
glist<00:05:02.280> courting<00:05:02.669> all<00:05:02.900> all<00:05:03.900> kiloton<00:05:04.560> was<00:05:04.740> good

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
glist courting all all kiloton was good

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:06.350 
glist courting all all kiloton was good
score<00:05:05.160> so<00:05:05.370> too<00:05:05.430> I<00:05:05.610> guess<00:05:05.880> isn't<00:05:06.090> the<00:05:06.180> worst

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
score so too I guess isn't the worst

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.909 
score so too I guess isn't the worst
thing<00:05:06.539> but<00:05:06.840> it<00:05:06.990> was<00:05:07.020> still<00:05:07.260> I<00:05:07.289> couldn't<00:05:07.680> so

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
thing but it was still I couldn't so

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:11.150 
thing but it was still I couldn't so
much<00:05:08.039> better<00:05:08.389> ray<00:05:09.389> counts<00:05:09.810> up<00:05:09.960> guys<00:05:10.139> I'll<00:05:10.950> see

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
much better ray counts up guys I'll see

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.180 
much better ray counts up guys I'll see
you<00:05:11.250> next<00:05:11.310> time<00:05:11.610> base
