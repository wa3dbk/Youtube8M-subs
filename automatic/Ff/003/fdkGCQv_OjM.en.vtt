00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.250
 today we find ourselves 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.600
 therefore, to say 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.860
 a beautiful program 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.630
 now we know how to play our complementarity 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.960
 and it's a strength it's finally it's a bit like 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.780
 because we wanted 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.080
 when we think we will see the day christophe remains the duality 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.880
 the otherness and the mirror effect she strives to find 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.830
 what is important is that you have to go back to the plans or six 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.100
 and for that reason that I tried to take into account the country 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.250
 the abilities why 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.250
 she writes hervÃ© 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.100
 singing on the road 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.470
 more in his role and no longer says it did not require an obvious thing 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.340
 when we made a three-year contract to train people 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.710
 we started by chatting 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.899
 but the discussions helped move the project forward in our heads 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.499
 and this voice near reunion ben here is the first pop album 

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:57.379
 it's possible and that's it 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:00.769
 it's convenient if I know how to cook 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.069
 there are ingredients there are recipes 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.749
 and if we can create something personal bar 

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:08.749
 sometimes you have to be disrespectful 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:17.540
 this is the case 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.540
 from September 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:28.099
 more the public 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:33.219
 is 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:36.219
 3 

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:39.299
 I am surprised 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:40.540
 they are
