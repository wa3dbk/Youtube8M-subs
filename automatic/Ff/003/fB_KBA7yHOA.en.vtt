about this h2o
now<00:02:04.060> I<00:02:04.090> noted<00:02:04.509> its<00:02:04.810> power<00:02:05.140> shell<00:02:05.619> in<00:02:05.800> the<00:02:05.920> h2o

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
now I noted its power shell in the h2o

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.889 
now I noted its power shell in the h2o

knuckle to move with your hand it's

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.210 
knuckle to move with your hand it's
something<00:02:47.200> that's<00:02:47.350> important<00:02:47.800> without<00:02:47.920> any
