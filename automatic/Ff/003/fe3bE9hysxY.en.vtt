00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
don't throw braided line when it comes

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.560 
don't throw braided line when it comes
to<00:00:26.680> a<00:00:26.710> spinnerbait<00:00:27.130> and<00:00:27.489> they're<00:00:28.270> worried

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
to a spinnerbait and they're worried

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:29.760 
to a spinnerbait and they're worried
they're<00:00:28.720> gonna<00:00:28.810> lose<00:00:28.989> fish<00:00:29.259> and<00:00:29.410> I<00:00:29.500> tell<00:00:29.680> you

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:29.770 
they're gonna lose fish and I tell you

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.409 
they're gonna lose fish and I tell you
won't<00:00:29.980> lose<00:00:30.189> fish<00:00:30.460> as<00:00:30.730> long<00:00:30.939> as<00:00:31.060> you<00:00:31.180> use<00:00:31.390> a

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:31.419 
won't lose fish as long as you use a

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:33.300 
won't lose fish as long as you use a
soft<00:00:31.869> enough<00:00:32.169> rod<00:00:32.439> with<00:00:32.680> that<00:00:32.829> braided<00:00:33.160> line

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:33.310 
soft enough rod with that braided line

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.700 
soft enough rod with that braided line
but<00:00:33.460> the<00:00:33.550> advantage<00:00:33.910> is<00:00:34.090> a<00:00:34.270> ton<00:00:34.600> of<00:00:34.630> feel<00:00:34.989> so<00:00:35.649> I

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
but the advantage is a ton of feel so I

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.139 
but the advantage is a ton of feel so I
could<00:00:35.920> tell<00:00:36.130> when<00:00:36.340> I<00:00:36.370> started<00:00:36.730> bringing<00:00:36.910> that

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149 
could tell when I started bringing that

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:39.360 
could tell when I started bringing that
bait<00:00:37.329> back<00:00:37.570> could<00:00:38.170> tell<00:00:38.380> it<00:00:38.530> was<00:00:38.620> all<00:00:39.100> wrapped

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
bait back could tell it was all wrapped

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.910 
bait back could tell it was all wrapped
around<00:00:39.579> and<00:00:40.210> I<00:00:40.449> didn't<00:00:41.140> get<00:00:41.199> it<00:00:41.350> untwist<00:00:41.710> at

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
around and I didn't get it untwist at

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.279 
around and I didn't get it untwist at
that<00:00:42.100> time<00:00:42.370> but<00:00:42.579> a<00:00:42.609> lot<00:00:42.820> of<00:00:42.850> times<00:00:43.210> what<00:00:44.170> you'll

00:00:44.279 --> 00:00:44.289 
that time but a lot of times what you'll

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:46.290

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
there you find it's all tangled you

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.400 
there you find it's all tangled you
could<00:00:48.429> pop<00:00:48.730> it<00:00:48.879> a<00:00:48.969> couple<00:00:49.269> times<00:00:49.510> and<00:00:49.719> it<00:00:50.170> comes

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
could pop it a couple times and it comes

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.799 
could pop it a couple times and it comes
free<00:00:50.829> so<00:00:51.340> it's<00:00:51.460> not<00:00:51.550> a<00:00:51.609> dead<00:00:51.850> cast<00:00:52.210> you<00:00:52.719> know

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
free so it's not a dead cast you know

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:54.389 
free so it's not a dead cast you know
you<00:00:52.870> can<00:00:53.079> fix<00:00:53.320> it<00:00:53.500> sort<00:00:53.739> of<00:00:53.800> halfway<00:00:54.160> back<00:00:54.339> to

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:54.399 
you can fix it sort of halfway back to

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.889 
you can fix it sort of halfway back to
the<00:00:54.640> boat<00:00:56.640> when<00:00:57.640> it<00:00:57.670> comes<00:00:57.879> a<00:00:58.000> long<00:00:58.210> bomb<00:00:58.600> and

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899 
the boat when it comes a long bomb and

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:00.840 
the boat when it comes a long bomb and
spinnerbaits<00:00:59.710> for<00:00:59.949> small<00:01:00.219> ease<00:01:00.399> like<00:01:00.579> we<00:01:00.730> are

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
spinnerbaits for small ease like we are

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.029 
spinnerbaits for small ease like we are
today<00:01:01.059> ever<00:01:01.839> since<00:01:02.140> I<00:01:02.260> started<00:01:02.440> using<00:01:02.589> braid<00:01:03.010> I

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
today ever since I started using braid I

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:05.580 
today ever since I started using braid I
started<00:01:03.460> catching<00:01:03.609> a<00:01:03.940> lot<00:01:04.239> more<00:01:04.480> fish<00:01:04.839> and<00:01:05.110> the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
started catching a lot more fish and the

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.230 
started catching a lot more fish and the
reason<00:01:05.980> is<00:01:06.130> I<00:01:06.310> mean<00:01:06.460> a<00:01:06.490> lot<00:01:06.700> of<00:01:06.820> times<00:01:07.030> those

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
reason is I mean a lot of times those

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.720 
reason is I mean a lot of times those
fish<00:01:07.480> hit<00:01:07.720> way<00:01:08.020> back<00:01:08.380> there<00:01:08.770> and<00:01:08.950> if<00:01:09.550> you're

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:09.730 
fish hit way back there and if you're

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.340 
fish hit way back there and if you're
using<00:01:09.940> the<00:01:10.090> line<00:01:10.360> with<00:01:10.570> a<00:01:10.600> lot<00:01:10.810> of<00:01:10.840> stretch<00:01:11.170> in

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
using the line with a lot of stretch in

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.660 
using the line with a lot of stretch in
it<00:01:11.440> you<00:01:11.560> go<00:01:11.680> to<00:01:11.710> set<00:01:11.950> that<00:01:12.100> hook<00:01:12.310> and<00:01:12.340> there's

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
it you go to set that hook and there's

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.910 
it you go to set that hook and there's
no<00:01:12.910> way<00:01:13.210> you<00:01:13.630> can<00:01:13.780> get<00:01:13.930> those<00:01:14.050> hooks<00:01:14.350> buried<00:01:14.800> in

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
no way you can get those hooks buried in

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.550 
no way you can get those hooks buried in
that<00:01:15.180> big<00:01:16.180> little<00:01:16.420> small<00:01:16.690> jaws<00:01:16.990> mouth<00:01:17.320> they
