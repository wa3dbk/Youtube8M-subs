00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 the third row I do the connecting column 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.820
 to go to the distance between two 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.519
 voluminous bars of the previous row 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.780
 I pull the loop and in this distance I see 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:19.190
 two bulk 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.190
 column so this is one volumetric column 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.699
 and the second volume bar 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.399
 then find a double crochet 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.940
 previous row and around this column 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:45.820
 with a cape I see two relief purl 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.790
 column and so the case nakid'm introducing a hook with 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.489
 wrong side of the face like this 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:58.629
 merge inside out capture work 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:01:01.989
 thread pull on the hook 3 loops 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:04.290
 I knit 2 loops and once again 2 loops and 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:09.929
 second time the same 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.929
 double crotch 

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:15.640
 I will go further into the distance between not 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.509
 voluminous bars of the previous row and 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:27.929
 I knit two bulk 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:27.929
 columns this is one volume column and 2 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.240
 and around the double crochet in the previous 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:44.500
 I see a row of two and relief purl 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:50.399
 the pillar is the one embossed purl 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.399
 column and now 2 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.260
 and in the distance between me voluminous 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:05.200
 the columns of the previous row 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.200
 I see two volumetric bar 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.610
 and then repeating in here again here again 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.620
 double crochet in the previous row around 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.390
 he can see two relief purl 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.480
 double crochet 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.580
 I knit it until the end of the row at the end 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.920
 row of case connecting stub with 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.640
 the beginning of the series, that is, it turns out that 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.190
 this row 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.069
 I knitted in the same way on the volumetric pattern 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.769
 the bars here were 1 column here i 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.900
 made 2 relief purl 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.120
 that is, I in this series increased 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.459
 the number of loops 8 that is, and in 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.950
 each of the eight wedges i have 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.500
 one two three four five six seven 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.380
 eight I did one at a time 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.900
 additional post so i 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.799
 I will do well in the next rows 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.799
 this is the third row
