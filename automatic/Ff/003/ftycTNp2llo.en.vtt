when I go out there so you know what you
see<00:02:35.780> is<00:02:36.680> what<00:02:36.890> you<00:02:36.920> get<00:02:37.130> you<00:02:37.190> might<00:02:37.430> get<00:02:37.610> a

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
see is what you get you might get a

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.130

different<00:02:37.970> thing<00:02:38.120> on<00:02:38.270> a<00:02:38.570> different<00:02:38.930> night

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
different thing on a different night

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.350 
different thing on a different night
every<00:02:39.680> night<00:02:39.830> so<00:02:40.040> I<00:02:40.070> don't<00:02:40.280> know<00:02:40.370> but<00:02:41.150> you<00:02:41.240> know

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
every night so I don't know but you know

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.680 
every night so I don't know but you know
I'm<00:02:41.450> not<00:02:41.570> trying<00:02:41.870> to<00:02:41.930> I'm<00:02:43.120> trying<00:02:44.120> to<00:02:44.240> make<00:02:44.450> my

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
I'm not trying to I'm trying to make my

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.670 
I'm not trying to I'm trying to make my
own<00:02:44.950> spot<00:02:45.950> yeah<00:02:46.520> so<00:02:47.030> and<00:02:47.720> last<00:02:48.020> question<00:02:48.200> do

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
own spot yeah so and last question do

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.920 
own spot yeah so and last question do
you<00:02:48.970> practice<00:02:49.970> different<00:02:50.570> way<00:02:50.630> because<00:02:50.810> the

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
you practice different way because the

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.180 
you practice different way because the
subtleties<00:02:51.350> are<00:02:51.380> what's<00:02:51.650> important<00:02:52.070> I<00:02:52.130> think

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
subtleties are what's important I think

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.060 
subtleties are what's important I think
and<00:02:52.550> you<00:02:52.870> seem<00:02:53.870> like<00:02:54.080> you've<00:02:54.290> practiced<00:02:54.740> every

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
and you seem like you've practiced every

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.380 
and you seem like you've practiced every
conceivable<00:02:55.460> way<00:02:55.730> to<00:02:55.880> hold<00:02:56.150> a<00:02:56.240> microphone

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
conceivable way to hold a microphone

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.450 
conceivable way to hold a microphone
that<00:02:56.960> nobody's<00:02:57.320> held<00:02:57.560> a<00:02:57.710> microphone<00:02:57.860> before

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
that nobody's held a microphone before

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.220 
that nobody's held a microphone before
whether<00:02:59.330> you're<00:02:59.510> grabbing<00:02:59.750> it<00:03:00.020> by<00:03:00.170> the

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
whether you're grabbing it by the

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.050 
whether you're grabbing it by the
microphone<00:03:00.680> box<00:03:01.040> you're<00:03:01.430> holding<00:03:01.730> it<00:03:01.820> kind<00:03:02.000> of

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
microphone box you're holding it kind of

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.900 
microphone box you're holding it kind of
like<00:03:02.210> that<00:03:02.450> or<00:03:02.690> whatever<00:03:02.990> you<00:03:03.170> don't<00:03:03.380> hold<00:03:03.620> it

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
like that or whatever you don't hold it

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.000 
like that or whatever you don't hold it
like<00:03:04.910> everybody<00:03:05.270> else<00:03:05.420> holds<00:03:05.750> it<00:03:05.870> it's<00:03:06.740> a<00:03:06.800> very

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
like everybody else holds it it's a very

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.190 
like everybody else holds it it's a very
awkward<00:03:07.190> microphone<00:03:07.940> actually<00:03:08.300> never

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
awkward microphone actually never

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.540 
awkward microphone actually never
thought<00:03:09.320> about<00:03:09.710> it<00:03:09.890> but<00:03:10.040> it's<00:03:10.160> got<00:03:10.310> the<00:03:10.400> big

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550
