00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.130 

we<00:00:24.760> cube<00:00:25.090> it<00:00:25.240> or<00:00:25.390> lose<00:00:25.869> it

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.280 

now<00:00:29.140> when<00:00:29.320> we're<00:00:29.470> panning<00:00:29.860> out<00:00:29.980> fine<00:00:30.310> gold<00:00:31.290> you

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
now when we're panning out fine gold you

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.060 
now when we're panning out fine gold you
really<00:00:32.739> have<00:00:32.950> to<00:00:33.450> remember<00:00:34.450> gold<00:00:35.140> is<00:00:35.379> 19<00:00:35.590> times

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
really have to remember gold is 19 times

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.830 
really have to remember gold is 19 times
heavier<00:00:36.250> than<00:00:36.519> water<00:00:36.670> and<00:00:37.180> everything<00:00:37.629> else

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
heavier than water and everything else

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.070 
heavier than water and everything else
is<00:00:38.140> is<00:00:38.680> 2<00:00:39.010> or<00:00:39.129> 3<00:00:39.309> times<00:00:39.519> lighter<00:00:39.970> than<00:00:40.120> that<00:00:40.330> so

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.080 
is is 2 or 3 times lighter than that so

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.740 
is is 2 or 3 times lighter than that so
you<00:00:41.590> really<00:00:41.620> have<00:00:42.129> to<00:00:42.160> agitate<00:00:42.970> the<00:00:43.150> material

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
you really have to agitate the material

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.470 
you really have to agitate the material
to<00:00:43.960> get<00:00:44.080> the<00:00:44.230> gold<00:00:44.500> to<00:00:44.739> sink<00:00:45.070> even<00:00:45.970> as<00:00:46.090> small<00:00:46.330> as

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
to get the gold to sink even as small as

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.810 
to get the gold to sink even as small as
it<00:00:46.570> is<00:00:46.629> it'll<00:00:46.960> still<00:00:47.290> sink<00:00:47.590> so<00:00:48.129> by<00:00:48.370> agitating

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
it is it'll still sink so by agitating

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.579 
it is it'll still sink so by agitating
what<00:00:49.239> I'm<00:00:49.330> talking<00:00:49.690> about<00:00:49.750> is<00:00:50.110> you<00:00:50.199> get<00:00:50.350> water

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:50.589 
what I'm talking about is you get water

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:52.889 
what I'm talking about is you get water
in<00:00:50.860> there<00:00:51.070> and<00:00:51.219> if<00:00:52.149> you're<00:00:52.300> just<00:00:52.510> doing<00:00:52.780> this

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:52.899 
in there and if you're just doing this

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:55.139 
in there and if you're just doing this
in<00:00:53.110> there<00:00:53.290> it's<00:00:53.920> not<00:00:54.129> agitating<00:00:54.820> it's<00:00:54.940> staying

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
in there it's not agitating it's staying

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.330 
in there it's not agitating it's staying
locked<00:00:55.329> up<00:00:55.629> but<00:00:56.320> if<00:00:56.440> you<00:00:56.559> start<00:00:56.800> shaking<00:00:57.280> it

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
locked up but if you start shaking it

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.049
