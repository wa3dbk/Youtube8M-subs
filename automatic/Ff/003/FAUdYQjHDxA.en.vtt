00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.200
 i 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.090
 hello that such friends welcome my 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.000
 name is daniel and well let's see what 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.760
 which it is responsible this video we will 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.560
 show them how to eliminate these 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.460
 requests we made on our disk 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.740
 hard in the best way in a way 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.510
 correct to remove a partition and 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.980
 to be able to extend our hard drive to its 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.289
 maximum capacity 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.090
 good as you can see I have here I'm going 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.890
 to my team and I have a partition of 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.239
 hard drive here this is my local disk 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.210
 I know that is where I have my system 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.730
 operative installed that is windows 7 and 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.309
 here I have a partition that uses it 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.860
 to back up my information since 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.320
 way t on my computer how can they 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.019
 see then it is free of virus free 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.239
 anything we're going to that team then 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:56.159
 I no longer have a virus because I use this 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.860
 partition to be able to save all my 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:01.409
 files partitions pass my files 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.870
 here the truth yes it was a took a bit of 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:05.850
 time because they were like 200 so many 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.210
 gigas that can see pure 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.460
 information I had and then I went through all 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.140
 that information here to me to my partition 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.250
 there are some files but now 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.600
 things 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.790
 and here I already have what is already 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.610
 to return first formative one time 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.350
 that you have formatted and analyzed what 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.900
 it was my record where my files were 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.479
 saved that did not have any viruses and 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.820
 again I would re- upload my files to 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.970
 my local disk if I already had what was a 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.580
 installed antivirus already had my drivers 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.190
 everything you already know in this channel I've 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.140
 taught to do all this if you do not look 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.420
 in my videos how to make a kind of 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.759
 backing in this way and well let's 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.100
 now delete what are the files 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.399
 that have been here in our pc in 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.330
 our backup and we're going to eliminate them 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.200
 me all these files still the ones 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.920
 I need so I'm going to create a new 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:06.490
 folder and are as backup 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:09.520
 so a folder to be able to pass all 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.310
 the files with control x I open the 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.180
 folder and here control b because 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.940
 We wait for it to pass all this is 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.970
 1.42 and gigabytes of information that 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.040
 I have there and well once I no longer 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.920
 have nothing of files there we are going to 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.590
 format it and then we're going to 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.450
 eliminate that good partition has already 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.120
 finished passing selection these 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.819
 files that I had there still saved 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.830
 in me in my backing as you can see 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.290
 it is completely empty yet 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.120
 we are going to give you right click and the 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.880
 let's format this way click 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.780
 right format and we leave the values 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.430
 just as we are in the beginning 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.470
 let's accept and wait for 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.030
 I finished doing the formatting as you can see 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.430
 it's going to take a long time since it 's 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.040
 completely empty our our 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.380
 memory ok our backup partition 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.269
 of the hard disk now it is time to 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.730
 eliminate that partition let's go 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.620
 here is our click start button 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.370
 right about what is our 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.549
 team 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.739
 and we go to the admin part ok 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.269
 It should be noted that this mode is 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.069
 is only for windows 7 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.349
 later I will make a video for you 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.840
 windows 8 so they can do it since 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:25.780
 change the interface a bit to be able 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.930
 access these options here we're going 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.519
 to record management and here is 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.659
 where are we going to work and are we going to 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.659
 eliminate our partition 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.569
 let's wait for it to load and once 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.700
 load here we have what is ours 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.190
 our partition this is my local disk 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.620
 This is an unassigned partition that 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.900
 creates when installing some system 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.680
 operative in your on your hard drive creates 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.720
 a backup partition but good what 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.150
 that we are going to work with is 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.650
 this one that is backup we're going to give a 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.660
 Right click on it and we're going to 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.120
 say remove volume 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.610
 this is where we are going to eliminate our 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.290
 partition and says it will remove it 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.410
 they will erase all the data in it we are going 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.850
 to say yes and once it has already 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.640
 removed as you can see then it is already 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:17.169
 of black color is to say that it is already not 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.700
 a partition is already simply a one 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.560
 part of our hard drive that is there 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:24.470
 blocked now what we have to do 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.810
 it is simply to extend this volume 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.880
 to occupy all our our 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.710
 ok capacity let's right click 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.990
 about our our partition of 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.090
 dislodge and we're going to give you here is not 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.040
 extend volume let's click 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.500
 we go in the next one that is going to be us 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:43.400
 the assistant we give the following 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:45.860
 here it tells us what space that 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.970
 we select the space of our everything 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:54.500
 our ok record here marks us 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:55.340
 which is 450 gigabytes here marks it in 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.600
 megabytes 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:02.240
 here we have what are the total size 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:05.920
 that we can expand here tells us 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:09.110
 Maximum space available are 45 450 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:11.300
 gigabytes that marks here here we what 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.660
 they mark megas but they are the 400 that it has 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.940
 our backup disc that we made 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.470
 our partition we are going to select them 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:22.669
 all inclusive here we can select 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:23.630
 if we want less or maybe half of 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:24.950
 that volume 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.620
 we are going to give you the following 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:30.050
 we leave all the space to extend 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.740
 we go in next and once done 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.750
 this we give in final 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:38.280
 As you can see, it has already spread 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:40.560
 and all our our local album is 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:44.690
 all the capacity that the disc already has 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:47.400
 it extended to 931 gigabytes which is 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.830
 practically almost in total what 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.270
 that what covers my hard drive already 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.669
 we can close these options and we're going 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.250
 here equipment to corroborate that no 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:59.490
 we have said partition and our disk 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:01.400
 local is already complete that then of 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:04.199
 this way friends is how you make a 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:07.800
 removal of a partition maybe you 

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:09.330
 have three or more or do not know by 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.370
 reasons that you have created them but not 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.349
 You know how to eliminate them is very simple 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:16.620
 I hope you liked the video and there 

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:18.569
