00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.490 
have a ton of tech books in PDF so
having<00:01:32.430> them<00:01:32.549> all<00:01:32.790> in<00:01:32.970> one<00:01:33.119> place<00:01:33.329> for<00:01:33.450> me<00:01:33.930> was

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
having them all in one place for me was

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.550 
having them all in one place for me was
you<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:35.700> touch<00:01:35.970> screen<00:01:36.119> is<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.930> little<00:01:37.439> bit

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
you the touch screen is a little bit

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.319 
you the touch screen is a little bit
finicky<00:01:38.009> so<00:01:38.610> you'll<00:01:38.759> need<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.000> have<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.150> little

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
finicky so you'll need to have a little

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.080 
finicky so you'll need to have a little
bit<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.600> patience<00:01:40.200> but<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.860> definitely<00:01:41.280> want

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
bit of patience but you definitely want

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.030 
bit of patience but you definitely want
to<00:01:42.180> calibrate<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.810> screen<00:01:43.049> this<00:01:43.530> makes<00:01:43.829> a

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
to calibrate the screen this makes a

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.399 
to calibrate the screen this makes a
huge<00:01:44.340> difference<00:01:44.820> in<00:01:45.240> how<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.630> reacts<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.229> your

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
huge difference in how it reacts to your

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.670 
huge difference in how it reacts to your
finger<00:01:46.890> it's<00:01:47.640> certainly<00:01:48.299> not<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:49.020> fastest

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
finger it's certainly not the fastest

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.649 
finger it's certainly not the fastest
when<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.100> comes<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.579> browsing<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.149> internet

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
when it comes to browsing the internet

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.730 
when it comes to browsing the internet
but<00:01:52.290> for<00:01:53.040> quick<00:01:53.399> reference<00:01:53.820> or<00:01:54.509> for<00:01:55.110> checking

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
but for quick reference or for checking

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.719 
but for quick reference or for checking
your<00:01:55.860> email<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.969> definitely<00:01:57.689> will<00:01:58.229> do<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.530> job

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
your email it definitely will do the job

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.219 
your email it definitely will do the job
after<00:01:59.729> googling<00:02:00.149> around<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.630> bit<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:00.930> found<00:02:01.110> a

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
found that you could modify the firmware

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.740 
found that you could modify the firmware
pretty<00:02:06.780> easily<00:02:07.399> once<00:02:08.399> i<00:02:08.580> upgraded<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.479> had
