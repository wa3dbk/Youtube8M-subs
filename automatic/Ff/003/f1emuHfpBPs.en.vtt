00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 sports friends i am simon your muscle 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.730
 macher we look at times that today 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.180
 creatine hcl from sap plus a little closer 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.269
 on 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.550
 HCl is the binding agent for hydrochloride 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.160
 of creatine to this hydrochloride 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.630
 being different is something special with it 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.210
 this product is one of those, so to speak 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.189
 Exot under the creative powder mostly 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.170
 One knows the creative monrad 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.890
 that this is not a monolith rat but 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.220
 just one 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.170
 hcl where it's the difference creatin 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.730
 in and of itself is not that sensitive 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.529
 like us, that's my time of one 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.300
 completely credible to other manufacturers 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.520
 it should not be crumbled 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.469
 immediately in connection with liquid 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.350
 it does not break immediately 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.010
 moment when it's 23 degrees its temperature 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.960
 changed 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.120
 all these are fairy tales all these are myths 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.190
 but of course it is the question how much 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.850
 is actually made by the creatine 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.829
 recorded 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.300
 exactly at the place we are none 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.750
 reliable data before that we say 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.180
 can 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.309
 a person always takes from creatin like that 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.379
 and so much on but the whole thing is 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.940
 probably something individual 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.800
 different the one human 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.960
 cope or get one 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.360
 creative month better than another 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.430
 the one let so 5 percent enthralled 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.369
 up to ten percent of the get 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.170
 diarrhea and 90 95 percent at all 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.000
 no digestive problems or 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.549
 Complaints and that's exactly how it is 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.220
 with the hcl it is another form of 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.970
 Creatine and a rather novel 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.740
 shape 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.869
 I always recommend that to the people 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.820
 simply with monrad no optimal 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.439
 We obtain results 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.259
 or at least we have hints 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.060
 that it is better in the area of ​​the intestine 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.100
 is recorded as once hü wire 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.390
 But there is no evidence 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.009
 That's why I want to be with the 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.210
 assertion also very restrained 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.220
 but it is definitely one 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.380
 alternative for those who are 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.420
 say I may be new responder 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.159
 I may be someone like that 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.170
 regardless of whether the one completely 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.909
 Excessive expectations than the man 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.829
 someone does not have any creatine 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.380
 gets creative well and exactly at the 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.420
 place of creatine hcl of sec plus 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.619
 Just try what I say 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.509
 it must have a taste namely 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.670
 blackberry taste is the taste 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.049
 well the solubility is mediocre must 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.850
 you just know so if yourself 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.560
 such a small sediment makes easy 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.509
 Swirl the glass again and 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.119
 So drink the solubility now 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.409
 Not 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.870
 but it is not 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:15.310
 soft drink but a functional drink 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.709
 Of course , you also have to know that 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.450
 that creatine hcl of sex you can find 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.720
 Of course in muscle maker shop the link 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.879
 to 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.860
 which is as always under the video in the 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:25.180
 infobox in there and see you in the 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.810
