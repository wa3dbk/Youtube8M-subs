 tan black that allows to teleport 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.089
 on Mars

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.810
 to do what will start them a 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.549
 war for control of this portal and 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.229
 the planet is good already at this moment of 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.510
 the episode I said wow that's 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.160
 really too original it does not look like 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.020
 not at all to the youth scenario 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.510

 earthly in space we want 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.300
 back to planet sea ​​so we do 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.590
 trust in short it's not really 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.880
 important was that the first 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.410
 minutes of the night that's during the 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.750
 first clash between the land and 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.760

 godfather the first episode plunges us 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.620
 fifteen years after the fraud the current 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.000

 so on earth for a visit from 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.950
 courtesy that could lead to 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.420
 peace with the confederacy terrier 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.310
 unfortunately an attack is committed 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.200
 against his person which will justify a 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.640
 attack of the glass empire what the 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.110
 soldiers are very bellicose and do not 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.180
 want to distinguish themselves only by the 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.070
 war and the bimbadaboum the terraces 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.960
 really do beam and the mouth is 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.849
 grosso merdo what is the episode 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.670
 the scenario is not flat we learn 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.319
 a little bit more each episode than this 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.030
 on the context even if it was 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.409
 asked well at the beginning where the characters 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.909
 speaking of these last I was 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:19.890
 first the glass princess what is 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:21.269
 a pacifist among the followers of the 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.610
 war she is sweet and passionate about 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.530
 a plan wow the rhyme of hell have you seen 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.090
 represents the tr tr good I stop my 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.040
 bullshit besides the mad press 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.049
 anecdotes from this 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.000
 slade this little blond my character 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:33.829
 favorite it is a landlord who was country 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.969
 he and his father by the princess he 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:36.590
 has a friendly relationship with 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:37.879
 the latter but it is very badly seen 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.230
 by the nobility heal it's the 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:41.269
 character who will certainly be the most 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.310
 expanded with regard to 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.500
 the other main character that asuka 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.090
 inao a student the land confederacy 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.689
 kiss a military formation become 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.370
 mandatory 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:51.319
 he begins to become interesting 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.810
 only from episode 3 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.180
 jaylani image of guys head in the air but 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.829
 in reality his head is very well fixed 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.269
 on six is seriously he really 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.159
 one side next to the plate 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.959
 but that's what he has his little thing there 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:04.849
 will be brought to fight the Martians by 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.169
 let's invoke circumstance by talking about 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:07.760
 fighting as the glass empire his 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:09.439
 technologically superior who did not 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.760
 really fighting the shots the grounds 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:12.590
 get fucked and mouth and they are 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.030
 obliged to redouble ingenuity when 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.950
 fighting to be able to stand up to 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.629
 pours bars and that's where the 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.579
 little hole 10 now becomes interesting 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:21.290
 as it is likely he posed takes 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:23.030
 at his time like a shikamaru 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.579
 to discover the flaws and 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.549
 exploit and so he can stand up to 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:30.530
 the year as zé meka is inevitably 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.239
 mouss élan satisfies both sides the 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.229
 purists with a style but four 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.690
 classic with confederation 

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:37.400
 earthly and modern style with the 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.949
 Empire pays with Mecas 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.930
 ultra-class design and non 

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:43.519
 really they are really serious and 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.840
 elevators you'll see but a little 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.609
 something that can stop people with this 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.530
 anime it's the 2d 3d at the beginning of 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:51.049
 episode 1 we are witnessing an exercise in 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.180
 shot 10 now and two in the 3d really 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.560
 disgusting and yuck beurk beurk it was 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.209
 really disappointing it was the 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.340
 first minutes of the episode by the 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.959
 Following the 3d really well managed so much 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.919
 that we notice almost more and 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.109
 nice to watch 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:04.970
 yes the animation is super good at the same 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.769
 weather this summer we are pretty well spoiled 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.319
 when it comes to animate they are great 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.699
 Danish animation 0 and fluid and the 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.530
 staging is dynamic but good one 

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:15.319
 anime it's not just a good 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.789
 scenario of good characters and a 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.070
 good animation and here I come to 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:21.109
 icing on the cake sushi the soundtrack 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.639
 really the soundtrack is nickel school 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.320
 beautifully at the dramatic side 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:25.099
 of the work at the same time these heroes 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.990
 yukiya amano 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:28.159
 that would tell you there the guy who has 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.849
 loaded from the west and a nights that do not 

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:30.469
 cooking 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:31.669
 he still insists who he is going to 

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:32.869
 besides do the one of swimming of 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:34.129
 work how do they recognize themselves in 

00:04:32.869 --> 00:04:35.569
 this room you know no natsu's 

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:37.639
 size should I take care of it but 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:39.319
 I did not say anything at all, it's very brief 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:41.089
 nice to listen all over the west to the 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:43.399
 end of episode 1 ouch it's fresh and 

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:45.409
 the opening oh my god he is sublime 

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:47.360
 really sublime it was realized by the 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:49.099
 khalifa group has a trio to fix a 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.809
 baroque pop genre stuff in parentheses 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:52.999
 thank you wikipedia they are the ones who have 

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:54.499
 realized the superb heading of mao shoujo 

00:04:52.999 --> 00:04:55.639
 madoka so here it is true that I have 

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:57.080
 said the cast was very 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:58.039
 interesting to turn this year so 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.990
 this is this year really has me a 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:01.490
 huge potential and I'm sorry like 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.929
 the animal has just begun 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.069
 I could give you in the list 

00:05:02.929 --> 00:05:05.719
 deep where you give the 

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:07.249
 problematic of the directors just 

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:08.959
 that they like a point 

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:10.219
 of broadband view neither him ie 

00:05:08.959 --> 00:05:12.649
 that human existence is devoid of 

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:14.839
 all meaning and subsequently given meaning 

00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:16.279
 little by little and make things a little 

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:17.539
 little more play this role but hey that we 

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:18.949
 will see at the end the animate 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:20.959
 if you are neophytes compared 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:22.639
 to animate because precisely you do not like 

00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:24.110
 this kind I really recommend this 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:25.519
 anime he will reconcile you with this 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.689
 last it's like double winner 

00:05:25.519 --> 00:05:28.399
 hours it's easy to watch parer at 

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:30.199
 what we usually have good in 

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:31.219
 this category finally short I hope that 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:33.289
 the video will have pleased you 

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:34.969
 do not hesitate to like to ask me 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:36.709
 comment my opinion on another to 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:37.430
 nîmes who knows I could maybe 

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:38.990
 make a video 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.490
 pay attention to a season anthem as to 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.119
 I tell you more and a 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.119
 next video
