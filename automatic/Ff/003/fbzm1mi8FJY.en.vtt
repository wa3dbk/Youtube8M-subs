 hello you are watching the program 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.660
 Primary specialists in the studio 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.030
 Catherine Semchenko 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.860
 integrated land development one of 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.420
 most popular housing formats 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.460
 construction in St. Petersburg closest 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.350
 surroundings about the benefits and 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.670
 disadvantages of such housing development we 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.500
 talk with the head 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.039
 consulting center Petersburg 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.240
 the property 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.680
 Olga tresh it and hello Olga 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.480
 please tell me the complex on your 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.090
 territory what is it so much 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.680
 there should be a volume of construction 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.360
 housing or maybe should be 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.899
 infrastructure that's what turns itself on this 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.969
 notion 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.980
 Well , here is the most complex 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.120
 land development implies that 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.190
 developer developer standing territory 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.579
 lays on his shoulders give work not 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.570
 only construction but also 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:56.100
 starting from the design of the complex and 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.989
 just living volume finished 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.079
 social objects and engine 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.070
 engineering component of communications 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.970
 These all questions are solved at 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.950
 developers or one developer 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.930
 mastering a large-scale territory like 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.560
 such a notion of scale restriction 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.009
 yes no such in the classification of the cat can 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.049
 divide by scale form the type there 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:21.450
 about neighborhoods areas yes that is 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.240
 scale overhead more there what what 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.400
 then there design yes standards there yes 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.860
 there arising this limitation so 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.689
 further here there is of course there its now 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.400
 problems because everything is on the shoulders 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.200
 developer well, what kind of highway 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.870
 the main ones that fit this 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.570
 complex yes there are connecting roads there 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:43.360
 it of course stay there loads there 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.900
 decisions of the federal city administration 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.570
 before the questions and now we see some there 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.060
 cons of some object but nonetheless 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.710
 the developer decides questions yes organize 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.500
 whale highway transport to 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.750
 linking infrastructures on gradually 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.190
 gave solving questions now such 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.230
 territories in the city and in 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.080
 the suburbs have scales 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.120
 from 100 thousand on average don't say yes 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.840
 there in the spot can be at home and there and 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:13.480
 50,000 and at 30 but overall ends and 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.180
 by millions yes now we only have there 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.790
 about 5 projects this is one millionth 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.760
 Petersburg hears and further their album 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.160
 Baltic pearl will not block it 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.530
 which which it is attracted to 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.820
 some more developers now us 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.480
 will visit the sea 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:34.150
 build in with a battleship but none the less 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.430
 This is one of the first large-scale projects about 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.580
 make a million of your territory there 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.380
 square meters is the north valley from 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:47.110
 the eye is building and you are a big project 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:48.790
 But in principle, the main millionaires if 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.110
 where can you take him renatu them too 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.640
 there I can count of course 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:56.080
 complex projects with scale 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:58.870
 volume of 7 up so well if 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:02.080
 reduce the volumes yes there look there 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.060
 up to 500 thousand to five hundred thousand is another 10 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.390
 on recruited from such a massive 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.040
 enough projects they are all in either 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.480
 in the sleeping areas is now a 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.280
 what do you think of the territory 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.900
 Petersburg area flax can be considered 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.600
 most promising it too for 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.670
 development of precisely integrated 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.010
 construction before just recently 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.440
 watched this question of course enough 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.140
 capacious more volume in the suburban area 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.170
 actively today still behind and occupying a share 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.610
 the market is a territory much more 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.190
 in the same land hillocks 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.720
 moray yes there are plans for the development of those 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.840
 the territory of those developers need 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.720
 started up their projects so the potential 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.440
 there is up to these territories there is potential 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.730
 areas of the city so for example 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.040
 Krasnoselsky Petrodvorets district cip 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.660
 Regime there area near location new 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.030
 Sergius, for example, which is now only 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:56.360
 began to accustom therefore 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.300
 projects enough development 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.730
 certainty it has already begun and new 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.230
 territory appeared as sertolovo ioannina 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.530
 large-scale territory as in your opinion 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.959
 what are the advantages and disadvantages of buying 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.700
 housing in the new building is 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:12.709
 complex that is it turns out how are you 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.110
 said yes it was just a field where 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.910
 there was nothing and here appear at home 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.440
 then catch up with time 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.019
 infrastructure here are the advantages in what 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.250
 minuses 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.650
 if you compare simply with the point 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.320
 building is the question of where there is now 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:30.200
 point building and and very little became 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:33.230
 to hiccups they are in scope 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.970
 force scale maybe it scares 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.060
 you need to understand how they try for them 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:40.100
 are being built up according to a plan 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.750
 forming the perimeter of the full 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.400
 for living people who are there 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.320
 invested there first second not 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.849
 representation it is clear that a million 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.860
 square meters is mastering 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:53.819
 enough time yes there 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:56.159
 for decades but the concept is built so 

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:57.740
 so that it was comfortable for the buyer and live 

00:04:56.159 --> 00:05:00.899
 later in these areas 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.580
 laid minimal yes there kindergarten 

00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:03.270
 the initial stage there first line 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.219
 by their 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.879
 appear further schools in 

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:10.879
 project planning maybe there in 

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:13.259
 commercial premises to 

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:15.270
 serve up this population and principle 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:17.189
 code and so evolve so for example 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:20.729
 sertolovo yes here came out in the fourteenth 

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:24.360
 year interesting cents from 60,000 but in 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:26.189
 average up to there per meter studio there from 1 and 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.979
 4 do not need to understand that the territory 

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:30.629
 they are just starting to learn and learn from you 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:32.519
 It draws on that that's what a plus 

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:34.769
 interesting price if the buyer understands 

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:37.270
 what is invested for the construction period 

00:05:34.769 --> 00:05:39.400
 eventually gets later 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:42.220
 high-grade residential quarter he will live 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.900
 in the normal quarter remember yes all 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.640
 so but you yourself said that if 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.590
 the project we are talking about the million-plus project 

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.420
 that no husband will develop you 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.550
 ten years and because if something 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:53.710
 very large large scale happens 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.960
 that the people of the first stage will be some kind 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:58.420
 time to live actually settings here 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.870
 I will emphasize and talk about it that pack 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:01.840
 one 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:03.940
 the developer is a real estate developer 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.500
 plans its territory in this way 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.190
 so that this was not there was this 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.870
 sensations 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.790
 still difficult economic situation 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.410
 complex project is probably more difficult 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:12.400
 finish than a point over there as 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:15.460
 your view more or 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.550
 dangers appear for buyers 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:20.230
 that such objects will not be committed 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:22.540
 here farming strategies of course 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:24.280
 once millions it is understood that 

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.980
 the company points Baltic pearl 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:29.430
 too up brought from myself to certain 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:32.140
 body home to 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:34.840
 further connected additionally 

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:36.910
 developers to which within the framework of the general 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:39.700
 concept implements this quarter ie 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:41.800
 principle the time period is stated yes not 

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:44.020
 several are now postponed in this term 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:46.060
 but nevertheless we see how to build in 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.040
 large-scale territory no one expected 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:50.770
 make this a macroeconomic situation with 

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:52.770
 courses with a mortgage only in such 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:55.300
 conditions this can be a little bit 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:57.490
 understand that the period can be shifted 

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.350
 he charge federation up in stable 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:03.040
 situation reliable companies have terms 

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:04.510
 mastering and they are invested once 

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.550
 maybe a little overlap 

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:07.870
 nuances of 

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:10.420
 engineering component yes there are such 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:12.640
 problems but again the companies solve 

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:14.700
 sometimes even jointly decide on such 

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.990
 territories scale out how to get out 

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:19.660
 the complexities of some kind of infrastructures 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:21.280
 engineering well and last year we see 

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:23.410
 what are some ways the mummy 

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:25.240
 news developed program there for 

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:27.430
 last chicken deductions there 

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:29.080
 head of social facilities well 

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.009
 cool can't be any harder 

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:33.369
 but thats not 

00:07:30.009 --> 00:07:35.889
 no lines make everything big 

00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:37.479
 thanks Olga remind our studio was
