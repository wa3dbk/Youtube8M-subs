00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
loving the sound it's amazing i'm really

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.100 
loving the sound it's amazing i'm really
happy<00:02:24.459> with<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:24.879> bill<00:02:25.090> that's<00:02:25.450> really<00:02:25.840> thick

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
happy with the bill that's really thick

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.199 
happy with the bill that's really thick
heavy<00:02:26.410> and<00:02:26.680> everything<00:02:27.069> and<00:02:27.250> then<00:02:27.849> you<00:02:28.030> got

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
heavy and everything and then you got

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.900 
heavy and everything and then you got
this<00:02:28.480> cord<00:02:29.170> I<00:02:29.410> wasn't<00:02:29.950> expecting<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.640> court

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
this cord I wasn't expecting the court

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.910 
this cord I wasn't expecting the court
to<00:02:31.120> be<00:02:31.239> so<00:02:31.450> thick<00:02:31.750> but<00:02:32.080> it's<00:02:32.260> really<00:02:32.739> nice

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
to be so thick but it's really nice

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.850 
to be so thick but it's really nice
because<00:02:33.280> that<00:02:34.150> way<00:02:34.390> it<00:02:34.630> doesn't<00:02:35.019> move<00:02:35.349> on<00:02:35.620> you

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
because that way it doesn't move on you

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.890 
because that way it doesn't move on you
and<00:02:36.099> it<00:02:36.190> doesn't<00:02:36.550> like<00:02:36.670> it<00:02:37.450> can't<00:02:37.750> really

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
and it doesn't like it can't really
