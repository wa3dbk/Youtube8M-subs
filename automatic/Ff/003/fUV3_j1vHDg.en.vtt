00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.299
 we're going to make quince meat for 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.180
 we need quinces in this case 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:17.910
 they are very bright because they are bigger 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:22.019
 and they do not hurt and are better to do 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.840
 the quince and sugar card 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:26.960
 first thing to do is chop and 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.240
 peel the quinces 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.009
 now in a container we have placed the 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.660
 pieces of quince already peeled and 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:38.899
 we have washed them well and there are 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.059
 to spend them in a way but weigh the 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:45.019
 now once they are cut and 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:47.629
 clean without any kind of heart and 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:53.360
 nuggets live to rne then for each 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:57.110
 kilo of clean quince we will put 800 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.870
 grams of sugar we will remove it well and 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.820
 what a let stand overnight 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.339
 removing it from time to time and 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:09.610
 we will see that the liquid becomes 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.610
 sugar and releasing the juice of the quince 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.030
 we have already put 800 grams of sugar 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.390
 every kilo of clean quince now 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:23.899
 stir a bit but there maceration 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:27.140
 to leave her from one day to the next because 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:29.920
 if it would not be impossible then do not do it and 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.030
 that is a granite 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.030
 and you have to do it like that 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.970
 father 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.799
 well after every night macerating 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:46.820
 the quince with the sugar you see 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:48.590
 the sugar is all liquid and then 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.200
 now we have to move this to a 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:56.600
 large casserole a casserole where you can 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:59.630
 this we will put it to 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:04.310
 to the fire and once it starts to boil 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:08.569
 we will not count 50 minutes before 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:12.190
 50 minutes boiling we will remove it and what 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:14.590
 we will go through a mill for 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.030
 is to do everything tells me that the flesh of 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.470
 Quince good as it starts to boil 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.500
 then now let's lower the fire a 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.300
 little so it does not boil very hard and what 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.330
 we are going to have the 50 minutes that we have 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.360
 saying 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.130
 but we will see from time to time 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.220
 and that's all 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.640
 the operation that have passed 50 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.430
 minutes 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.860
 so our quince is already made 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.020
 now what we have to do 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.990
 with the other container and with a 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:51.080
 mash then pass it so that it is 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.910
 thin and form the cream that then 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.070
 will harden forming the flesh of 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.120
 quince so now work a 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.120
 little with the doll 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.050
 ah 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.660
 and we have spent all the quince you see 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.390
 that is now well a cream 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:28.300
 soft but then we 're going to put 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:32.540
 now in containers and when 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:34.519
 solidify and cool down they will stay 2 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.620
 so even though it looks now yes so 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.790
 soft and that has nothing to do 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.610
 for the final result 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.920
 for her we only put it in the 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:49.360
 containers and zoom out 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:51.130
 in cold here we have already the recipients 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:55.390
 they are tupperware is that then the 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:57.280
 we will cover with its corresponding and a 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.240
 cold time we will put it in the fridge to 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.530
 to be saved for almost a year 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.990
 being well preserved in the fridge and 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.230
 well closed you can go pulling 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.350
 throughout the year and be in 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:11.680
 terms 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:15.770
 'we go like the first day 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:18.920
 once it solidifies we have overflowed 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:24.530
 one of the super cool and here you have the 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:29.090
 result lend quince and shape and 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:33.580
 it sounds like cutting sheets or pieces or 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.580
 what we want and go eating
