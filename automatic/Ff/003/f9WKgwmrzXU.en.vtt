00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.830

 style outback or copycat outback and for 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.470
 we need the following 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.230
 elements first of all we need 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:35.590
 two tablespoons of buttermilk or milk 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:38.650

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.739

 garlic powder a pinch of black pepper 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.790
 and a pinch of salt in principle this is 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.399
 everything we need but we have 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.320
 talked about buttermilk the buttermilk that 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:00.880
 is is a very necessary thing in the 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.219
 kitchen that we explain in one of 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.479
 our segments from home with you if 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:06.549
 you want to see it in detail but it 's so 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.920
 easy that we're going to do it here so that 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:10.299
 See how easy it is and what 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.590
 convenient to have it because it has 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:15.460
 many, many 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:19.539
 it's just like you see half a cup of 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:22.649
 whole milk and a tablespoon and a half of 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:28.110
 lemon juice that's all it's just 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:32.010
 Mix the lemon juice with the milk 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.500
 stir the little bit 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.780
 a spark tub and now we would leave it 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.130
 rest, let it rest for 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.290
 about 10 minutes until the milk set 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.450
 but as we had already prepared it 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.790
 we can proceed to prepare that 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.550
 delicious blue cheese sauce in a 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:55.040
 container we simply mix all 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.040
 the ingredients the buttermilk 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.520
 the Mayo 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.450
 blue cheese 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:12.950
 and now the fourth pinches come 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:17.840
 about a quarter teaspoon 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:22.550
 of onion powder 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:27.950
 quarter teaspoon garlic powder 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:32.420
 a little pinch of pepper a 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:34.310
 pinch of salt and that's all that 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.990
 we need we just have now 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.990
 to stir it 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.970
 for a few seconds a minute 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.970
 approximately maybe 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:52.610
 and here we have the blue cheese sauce 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.050
 blue cheese outback style can be 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.940
 make a little more liquid or a 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.800
 little more less liquid thicker 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.510
 as you like it is a matter of 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.300
 throw a little more or a little 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.760
 Buttermilk least that's all 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.230
 put in the fridge in a vase cited in 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.630
 a tightly closed jar you put in the 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.700
 fridge and leave it at least one hour 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.250
 that way that sauce is curdling 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.930
 it thickens and takes all the flavor that 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.940
 have to have for the moment when 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.110
 put it in the salad that you enjoy 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.110
 you will be very good
