00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.730

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.760

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.890
 Good, family, it's kind of messy then. 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.500
 Do not worry, let's start with the 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.530
 social networks that is the basics right 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.980

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.879
 celebrates in the river and most of my 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.800
 friends live far away, we talk 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.899
 enough to stand by will see the 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.140
 shetty grandchildren that the one you take 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.420
 photo it appears quickly the echofon that 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.219
 is also a twitter application and the 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.439
 instagram walks favorite social network 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.479
 huh 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:09.570
 now let's go to the photo applications 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.000
 which are the ones I like the most 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.479
 I have the camera more than it is one of those 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.369
 I like it because, after all 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.110
 He has the timer. 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.229
 so let me choose a photo here 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.540
 I already like him for photos of 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:29.939
 landscape it looks beautiful so you come 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:31.890
 here edit and it has several effects I 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.700
 I really like the clarity it leaves to 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:41.130
 image sharper and I really like it 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.060
 also to use the hdr bit special 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.770
 the hdr 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.110
 only that sometimes he gets very stressed 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.770
 So I come here in advanced and 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.049
 decreases a little so he does not get 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.640
 so strong 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.700
 so the camera plus one of mine 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.040
 Preferred 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.350
 the team that I spoke to him here 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.960
 When you take a picture, you click on it. 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.799
 ball and he has the team here then you 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.500
 You can choose five 15 30 seconds at 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:13.800
 very easy and also it has flash that 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.710
 you can turn on the flash 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.500
 is the good front the next application of 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.940
 photos is what I most use without a doubt 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.250
 lately everyone has asked me 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.890
 it's the after light 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:30.680
 the asteroid it is very easy to move 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.680
 You choose to cam the photo here on the camera. 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:38.550
 so you choose the photo and put huse 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.470
 here it already has some effects ready here 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.930
 in this little ball run you can 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.330
 choose various effects 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.340
 I use a lot these first two that 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.170
 this is another way and this one give it 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.920
 one darkened a little 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:55.640
 has several effects ready here and there for 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.620
 example I'll choose this first ok 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.570
 here in this first option you can 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.540
 choose clarity 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.190
 so you can choose the strength that goes 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.430
 have finally 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:11.220
 and here you will choose brightness then 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.600
 you can change many things in this 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.410
 first option 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.810
 here is to go messing this one's for 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.850
 these effects sometimes appears appears in the 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.440
 missing a little more arises in line are 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.980
 various light effects 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:28.620
 I think it's the best I can do too. 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:32.310
 I chose this first one that I 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.470
 You know you know 500 in the photo and it's cool. 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.160
 also because you can reverse the 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.200
 photo you can cut the photo and the best 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.510
 all you can put that ball 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.550
 when it does not fit in instagram 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.920
 so you can put the ball together so much 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.690
 in the horizontal photo as in the photo 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.650
 vertical 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:54.900
 well this is one of my favorites too 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:57.360
 I use a lot to mount the pike 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.120
 frame a frame that when we do 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.780
 assemblage of looks for example that the 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:07.320
 people choose multiple photos 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.870
 so you select the photos here and there 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.970
 you fix 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.350
 usually I some photos in the pike 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.320
 frame 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:23.789
 Then I save the three photos in the same 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:26.760
 and said in asteroid after good for video 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:28.440
 I found this incredible that he 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.900
 is the same as the frame pt only 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.810
 He's into the video so he's the maximum. 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.480
 You're this week I posted a photo of 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.400
 model I did in my college 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:41.970
 so I've already left here chosen 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.470
 you let me come here ahead 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.800
 there you can choose several 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.900
 ways to assemble the videos and you can 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.670
 mix photo with video then by 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.500
 example you chose here is jazz 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:56.930
 I selected the videos but you come here 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:05:00.750
 in our camera and choose the videos 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:03.510
 videos choose the videos you want 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:06.930
 here I have already solved and mounted and the legal is 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:09.330
 What can you come here for ? 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.980
 and then you choose you can by even a 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.360
 background music 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.240
 any song you already have in your 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.970
 phone or you can put the 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:21.330
 video even with the sound you put here 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:24.210
 to the video you are taller and finally 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.770
 and then you put predicted to see the video 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.530
 so here is a little video of my super 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.540
 model I did in college in action 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.190
 two photos and videos 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.500
 I found this application very cool. 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.480
 also he is super easy to move 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.550
 I like very much also an application 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.830
 music youtube 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:44.850
 the youtube you can choose the songs 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:47.550
 on YouTube and upload the song then 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:50.010
 when you load the video clip 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:52.940
 You can listen to him without music and without 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:52.940
 same internet 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:58.140
 so for example now every airplane mode 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.970
 and the music is playing normal 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:02.730
 I think it's really cool that you put it on. 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:04.830
 a list of favorites leaves your 

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:06.860
 youtube favorite songs there you 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:10.080
 You can hear the same internet 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:12.240
 good people is this another application that I 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.510
 I also like a success that is the 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:17.700
 very well known gps he has helped 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:20.970
 many streets lately I'm a 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:23.730
 bad driver then eisbein does 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:26.640
 you too, you can navigate here 

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:31.110
 You can go where you go and he will. 

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:34.380
 sending and the coolest thing is that he scored 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:36.780
 the time from where you go 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.960
 so it's very practical because you know 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:40.930
 the exact time it will be 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:45.300
 in place and finally to finish 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:48.819
 the stronger the application of the 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:51.520
 instagram that I think too much because you 

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:54.220
 Can you see I have no internet? 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:56.580
 but you can see what we people 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:59.710
 follow and who can not in this grand 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:01.900
 I hope you liked it. 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:04.389
 Good, I 'm not a good teacher 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:06.099
 I know it's very difficult to stay 

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:08.050
 explaining these things closer in the 

00:07:06.099 --> 00:07:11.050
 practice you will see that it is super easy 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:13.120
 down there that you will arm alisuper 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:15.220
 Most applications are 

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:18.190
 free but that are paulo are well 

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:20.320
 and it's worth very much worth it 

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:23.580
 I want to see everyone putting the 

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:27.300
 effects boats in the instagram photos 

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:27.300
 Kiss and see you next time.
