called<00:02:09.350> blue<00:02:09.500> bag<00:02:09.799> recycling<00:02:10.399> the<00:02:10.549> concept

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
called blue bag recycling the concept

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.310 
called blue bag recycling the concept
was<00:02:11.060> that<00:02:11.090> residents<00:02:11.720> would<00:02:11.840> carefully

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
was that residents would carefully

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.170 
was that residents would carefully
separate<00:02:12.769> all<00:02:12.950> the<00:02:13.130> recyclable<00:02:13.670> materials

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
separate all the recyclable materials

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.150 
separate all the recyclable materials
from<00:02:14.630> their<00:02:14.810> trash<00:02:15.110> and<00:02:15.350> then<00:02:15.799> put<00:02:16.040> those

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
from their trash and then put those

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.069 
from their trash and then put those
recyclables<00:02:16.850> into<00:02:17.150> a<00:02:17.180> special<00:02:17.660> blue<00:02:17.810> bag

recyclables into a special blue bag
which<00:02:18.950> would<00:02:19.160> then<00:02:19.340> be<00:02:19.370> thrown<00:02:19.940> back<00:02:20.209> into<00:02:20.570> the

which would then be thrown back into the

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.449 
which would then be thrown back into the
trash<00:02:20.840> and<00:02:21.140> as<00:02:21.500> you<00:02:21.620> may<00:02:21.739> have<00:02:21.769> guessed<00:02:22.070> the

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
trash and as you may have guessed the

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.390 
trash and as you may have guessed the
program<00:02:22.850> was<00:02:23.030> a<00:02:23.060> huge<00:02:23.630> success<00:02:24.190> no<00:02:25.190> no<00:02:25.280> wait

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400

world recyclables from the blue bags

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.729 
world recyclables from the blue bags
would<00:02:32.390> be<00:02:32.510> easily<00:02:32.900> separated<00:02:33.380> from<00:02:33.620> the

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
would be easily separated from the

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.620 
would be easily separated from the
regular<00:02:34.070> garbage<00:02:34.310> but<00:02:34.670> trash<00:02:35.090> compactors

regular garbage but trash compactors

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.050 
regular garbage but trash compactors
would<00:02:35.840> often<00:02:36.170> break<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.680> blue<00:02:36.829> bags<00:02:37.040> and<00:02:37.489> push

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
would often break the blue bags and push

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.729 
would often break the blue bags and push
it<00:02:38.209> all<00:02:38.329> together<00:02:38.630> like<00:02:38.780> a<00:02:38.900> big<00:02:39.079> old<00:02:39.230> trash<00:02:39.530> pop

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
it all together like a big old trash pop

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.410 
it all together like a big old trash pop
overall<00:02:40.220> the<00:02:40.370> blue<00:02:40.519> bag<00:02:40.700> program<00:02:41.180> only

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
overall the blue bag program only

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.270 
overall the blue bag program only
succeeded<00:02:41.959> in<00:02:42.140> recycling<00:02:42.680> about<00:02:42.920> eight<00:02:43.130> to

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
succeeded in recycling about eight to

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.550 
succeeded in recycling about eight to
ten<00:02:43.459> percent<00:02:43.609> of<00:02:43.850> our<00:02:43.970> garbage<00:02:44.239> and<00:02:44.630> in<00:02:44.959> 2008

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
ten percent of our garbage and in 2008

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.530 
ten percent of our garbage and in 2008
they<00:02:45.709> finally<00:02:46.010> cut<00:02:46.160> the<00:02:46.250> program<00:02:46.609> but<00:02:47.269> hey<00:02:47.420> you

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
they finally cut the program but hey you

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.360 
they finally cut the program but hey you
got<00:02:47.690> to<00:02:47.810> hand<00:02:47.959> it<00:02:48.049> to<00:02:48.109> the<00:02:48.260> city<00:02:48.470> of<00:02:48.530> Chicago<00:02:48.709> if

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
got to hand it to the city of Chicago if

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.199 
got to hand it to the city of Chicago if
at<00:02:49.549> first<00:02:49.579> you<00:02:49.910> don't<00:02:50.060> succeed<00:02:50.180> try<00:02:50.720> try<00:02:51.230> again

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
at first you don't succeed try try again

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.550 
at first you don't succeed try try again
using<00:02:53.209> the<00:02:53.299> same<00:02:53.510> exact<00:02:53.840> failed<00:02:54.109> tact

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
using the same exact failed tact

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.730 
using the same exact failed tact
for<00:02:55.340> 12<00:02:55.640> years<00:02:55.730> I<00:02:56.080> think<00:02:57.080> that's<00:02:57.290> that's<00:02:57.650> how

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 
for 12 years I think that's that's how

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.490 
for 12 years I think that's that's how
the<00:02:57.800> expression<00:02:58.069> goes<00:02:58.370> right<00:02:58.670> so<00:02:59.480> yeah<00:02:59.959> common

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
the expression goes right so yeah common

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.410 
the expression goes right so yeah common
household<00:03:00.890> expression<00:03:01.610> of<00:03:01.700> course<00:03:01.910> Chicago

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
household expression of course Chicago

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.940 
household expression of course Chicago
isn't<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:02.750> only<00:03:02.930> city<00:03:03.230> whose<00:03:03.440> recycling

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
isn't the only city whose recycling

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.280 
isn't the only city whose recycling
program<00:03:04.280> got<00:03:04.459> off<00:03:04.610> to<00:03:04.790> a<00:03:04.819> rocky<00:03:04.940> start<00:03:05.120> in<00:03:05.540> 2002

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
program got off to a rocky start in 2002

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.230 
program got off to a rocky start in 2002
New<00:03:06.470> York<00:03:06.709> had<00:03:06.860> to<00:03:06.950> stop<00:03:07.190> recycling<00:03:07.580> glass<00:03:08.000> and

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
New York had to stop recycling glass and

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.610 
New York had to stop recycling glass and
plastic<00:03:08.630> because<00:03:08.840> at<00:03:09.020> the<00:03:09.110> time<00:03:09.260> it<00:03:09.470> cost

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
plastic because at the time it cost

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.470 
plastic because at the time it cost
twice<00:03:09.890> as<00:03:09.950> much<00:03:10.100> to<00:03:10.400> recycle<00:03:10.819> it<00:03:10.910> as<00:03:11.060> it<00:03:11.239> did<00:03:11.390> to

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
twice as much to recycle it as it did to

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.030 
twice as much to recycle it as it did to
throw<00:03:11.660> it<00:03:11.750> away<00:03:11.840> and<00:03:12.200> there<00:03:12.680> have<00:03:12.770> been<00:03:12.800> many

close<00:03:46.400> second<00:03:46.940> at<00:03:47.090> 62<00:03:47.600> of<00:03:47.780> course<00:03:48.080> I<00:03:48.200> think<00:03:48.319> the

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
close second at 62 of course I think the

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49.930 
close second at 62 of course I think the
real<00:03:48.680> question<00:03:49.069> though<00:03:49.190> is<00:03:49.370> do<00:03:49.760> these

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
real question though is do these

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.090 
real question though is do these
programs<00:03:50.390> make<00:03:50.630> a<00:03:50.660> difference<00:03:51.080> is<00:03:51.290> recycling

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
programs make a difference is recycling

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.410 
programs make a difference is recycling
actually<00:03:52.550> beneficial<00:03:52.940> to<00:03:53.180> the<00:03:53.300> environment

actually beneficial to the environment

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.440 
actually beneficial to the environment
and<00:03:53.959> is<00:03:54.440> it<00:03:54.560> worth<00:03:54.709> the<00:03:54.890> extra<00:03:54.950> cost<00:03:55.330> we<00:03:56.330> will

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
and is it worth the extra cost we will

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.860 
and is it worth the extra cost we will
examine<00:03:56.780> these<00:03:57.260> questions<00:03:57.680> and<00:03:57.920> more<00:03:58.130> in<00:03:58.870> the

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
examine these questions and more in the

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.550 
examine these questions and more in the
next<00:04:00.170> video<00:04:00.440> that<00:04:01.430> I<00:04:01.459> make<00:04:02.140> stay<00:04:03.140> tuned
