so other than that let me tell you about
the<00:01:03.239> game<00:01:03.480> on<00:01:03.809> what<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:04.290> know<00:01:04.379> about<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.860> that

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
the game on what I know about is that

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.850 
the game on what I know about is that
there's<00:01:05.220> over<00:01:05.430> 200<00:01:05.640> refinements<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:07.590> the

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
there's over 200 refinements to the

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.100 
there's over 200 refinements to the
gameplay<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:09.090> most<00:01:09.270> important<00:01:09.750> one<00:01:09.780> being

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
gameplay the most important one being

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.950 
gameplay the most important one being
the<00:01:10.229> physics<00:01:10.680> engine<00:01:10.830> which<00:01:11.340> now<00:01:11.580> lets<00:01:11.960> you

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
the physics engine which now lets you

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.640 
the physics engine which now lets you
calculate<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.890> move<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.460> seems<00:01:14.700> more<00:01:14.939> real

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
calculate the move so it seems more real

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.080 
calculate the move so it seems more real
the<00:01:16.650> gameplay<00:01:16.860> for<00:01:17.220> example<00:01:17.580> body<00:01:17.759> checks

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
the gameplay for example body checks

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.840 
the gameplay for example body checks
will<00:01:18.299> be<00:01:18.330> unique<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.310> it's<00:01:20.310> thanks<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.700> the

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
will be unique and it's thanks to the

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.030 
will be unique and it's thanks to the
new<00:01:20.970> engine<00:01:21.119> before<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:22.080> was<00:01:22.200> animation<00:01:22.890> based

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
new engine before it was animation based

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.070 
new engine before it was animation based
now<00:01:23.400> it's<00:01:23.580> real<00:01:23.790> time<00:01:24.030> based<00:01:24.330> so<00:01:24.900> that's

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
now it's real time based so that's

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.740 
now it's real time based so that's
pretty<00:01:25.320> cool<00:01:25.409> yeah<00:01:26.340> broken<00:01:26.939> sticks<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.600> can

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
pretty cool yeah broken sticks you can

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.240 
pretty cool yeah broken sticks you can
now<00:01:27.840> play<00:01:28.080> with<00:01:28.229> broken<00:01:28.560> sticks<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:29.009> can<00:01:29.159> go

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
now play with broken sticks you can go

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.649 
now play with broken sticks you can go
back<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.700> bench<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.090> pick<00:01:30.270> up<00:01:30.420> another

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
back to the bench and pick up another

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.289 
back to the bench and pick up another
stick<00:01:30.990> or<00:01:31.200> your<00:01:31.740> friend<00:01:32.009> teammate<00:01:32.939> can<00:01:33.119> give

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
stick or your friend teammate can give

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.960 
stick or your friend teammate can give
you<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.560> stick<00:01:34.560> replacement<00:01:35.220> on<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.490> spot<00:01:35.700> as

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
you a stick replacement on the spot as

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.660 
you a stick replacement on the spot as
well<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.900> facetime<00:01:37.439> mechanics<00:01:38.009> or<00:01:38.189> faceoff

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
well the facetime mechanics or faceoff

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.210 
well the facetime mechanics or faceoff
mechanics<00:01:39.530> you<00:01:40.530> can<00:01:40.680> do<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.799> couple<00:01:41.130> different

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
mechanics you can do a couple different

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.520 
mechanics you can do a couple different
things<00:01:41.430> like<00:01:41.729> geeking<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.360> there's<00:01:43.140> also<00:01:43.350> the

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
things like geeking and there's also the

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.240 
things like geeking and there's also the
hustle<00:01:44.520> mode<00:01:44.729> which<00:01:45.090> lets<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:46.070> it's<00:01:47.070> almost

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
hustle mode which lets you it's almost

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.039 
hustle mode which lets you it's almost
like<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.520> turbo<00:01:47.880> speed<00:01:48.149> boost<00:01:48.450> from<00:01:48.720> the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
like a turbo speed boost from the

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.499 
like a turbo speed boost from the
