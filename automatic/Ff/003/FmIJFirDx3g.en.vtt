00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
finally comes out I ended up having to

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.369 
finally comes out I ended up having to
use<00:02:22.540> this<00:02:23.540> tool<00:02:23.870> over<00:02:24.049> here<00:02:25.870> and<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:27.110> reason

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
use this tool over here and the reason

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:29.350 
use this tool over here and the reason
why<00:02:27.530> is<00:02:27.590> because<00:02:27.769> this<00:02:28.459> this<00:02:28.940> tool<00:02:29.180> right<00:02:29.299> here

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
why is because this this tool right here

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.880 
why is because this this tool right here
was<00:02:29.660> too<00:02:29.900> wide<00:02:30.110> in<00:02:30.319> here<00:02:30.530> and<00:02:30.650> it<00:02:30.709> wasn't

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
was too wide in here and it wasn't

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.390 
was too wide in here and it wasn't
didn't<00:02:31.459> enough<00:02:31.670> grip<00:02:32.060> on<00:02:32.299> the<00:02:32.769> the<00:02:33.769> sway<00:02:34.129> bar

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
didn't enough grip on the the sway bar

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.880 
didn't enough grip on the the sway bar
there<00:02:34.670> so<00:02:35.000> it<00:02:35.180> kept<00:02:35.420> pulling<00:02:35.660> off<00:02:35.900> of<00:02:36.079> it<00:02:36.230> and

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
there so it kept pulling off of it and

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.349 
there so it kept pulling off of it and
on<00:02:37.160> the<00:02:37.280> other<00:02:37.370> side<00:02:37.459> I<00:02:37.640> actually<00:02:37.849> use<00:02:38.150> this

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:38.359 
on the other side I actually use this

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:41.530 
on the other side I actually use this
one<00:02:38.540> over<00:02:38.720> here<00:02:39.579> but<00:02:40.579> I<00:02:40.609> think<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.209> reason<00:02:41.450> why

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
one over here but I think the reason why

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.819 
one over here but I think the reason why
this<00:02:41.720> one<00:02:41.900> ended<00:02:42.079> up<00:02:42.200> working<00:02:42.349> on<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.680> other

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
this one ended up working on the other

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:46.259 
this one ended up working on the other
side<00:02:43.069> was<00:02:43.250> because<00:02:44.019> the<00:02:45.019> ball<00:02:45.230> joint<00:02:45.530> had<00:02:45.920> been

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
side was because the ball joint had been

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.059 
side was because the ball joint had been
pulled<00:02:47.269> out<00:02:47.420> and<00:02:47.870> so<00:02:47.930> I<00:02:48.079> was<00:02:48.290> able<00:02:48.380> to<00:02:48.530> get<00:02:48.680> good

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
pulled out and so I was able to get good

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.460 
pulled out and so I was able to get good
access<00:02:49.340> in<00:02:49.730> around<00:02:50.090> it<00:02:50.299> so

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
access in around it so

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.950 
access in around it so
I<00:02:52.940> want<00:02:53.940> to<00:02:54.000> have<00:02:54.120> a<00:02:54.150> couple<00:02:54.450> different<00:02:54.810> types

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
I want to have a couple different types

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.920 
I want to have a couple different types
of<00:02:55.170> Polar's<00:02:55.470> just<00:02:55.830> in<00:02:55.950> case<00:02:56.630> this<00:02:57.630> style

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
of Polar's just in case this style

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.760 
of Polar's just in case this style
doesn't<00:02:58.140> work<00:02:58.350> for<00:02:58.650> you<00:03:00.200> okay<00:03:01.200> so<00:03:01.260> now<00:03:01.590> we're

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
doesn't work for you okay so now we're

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.490 
doesn't work for you okay so now we're
ready<00:03:01.800> to<00:03:02.070> install<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:04.010> steel<00:03:05.010> post<00:03:05.280> here

ready to install the steel post here
instructions<00:03:07.500> how<00:03:07.650> you<00:03:07.710> to<00:03:07.890> do<00:03:08.040> this<00:03:09.030> second

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
instructions how you to do this second

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.840 
instructions how you to do this second
they<00:03:09.660> really<00:03:10.140> doesn't<00:03:10.440> matter<00:03:10.500> which<00:03:10.830> or<00:03:11.700> do

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
they really doesn't matter which or do

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.180 
they really doesn't matter which or do
you<00:03:11.970> do<00:03:12.120> it<00:03:12.300> so<00:03:12.600> I'm<00:03:13.260> gonna<00:03:13.350> put<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:13.710> little<00:03:13.920> bit

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
you do it so I'm gonna put a little bit

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.380 
you do it so I'm gonna put a little bit
of<00:03:14.310> Loctite<00:03:14.460> on<00:03:14.760> here

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
of Loctite on here

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.150 
of Loctite on here
just<00:03:16.380> because<00:03:16.530> I<00:03:16.620> don't<00:03:16.800> want<00:03:16.920> to<00:03:17.010> take<00:03:17.130> a

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
just because I don't want to take a

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.940 
just because I don't want to take a
chance<00:03:17.250> having<00:03:17.760> this<00:03:17.910> come<00:03:18.150> on

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
chance having this come on

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:27.580 
chance having this come on
so<00:03:19.950> I<00:03:20.010> did<00:03:20.190> that

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.760 

so<00:03:28.160> I<00:03:28.190> got<00:03:28.489> that<00:03:28.610> Loctite<00:03:29.090> on<00:03:29.120> there<00:03:32.770> now

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
so I got that Loctite on there now

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
so I got that Loctite on there now
you're<00:03:33.890> just<00:03:34.069> gonna<00:03:34.190> go<00:03:34.370> ahead<00:03:34.430> and<00:03:34.550> tighten

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
you're just gonna go ahead and tighten

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.680 
you're just gonna go ahead and tighten
it<00:03:34.940> up<00:03:35.120> and<00:03:35.750> use<00:03:36.200> some<00:03:36.440> kind<00:03:36.650> of<00:03:37.330> I'm<00:03:38.330> using<00:03:38.540> a

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690 
it up and use some kind of I'm using a

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.660 
it up and use some kind of I'm using a
little<00:03:40.900> screwdriver<00:03:41.900> here<00:03:42.250> to<00:03:43.250> hold<00:03:43.430> it<00:03:43.520> in

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
little screwdriver here to hold it in

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.150 
little screwdriver here to hold it in
place<00:03:43.819> cuz<00:03:44.180> you<00:03:44.300> want<00:03:44.480> to<00:03:44.569> keep<00:03:44.720> this

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
place cuz you want to keep this

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.370 
place cuz you want to keep this
horizontal<00:03:46.180> for<00:03:47.180> that<00:03:47.390> d-ring<00:03:47.900> that<00:03:48.050> goes<00:03:48.200> in

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
horizontal for that d-ring that goes in

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.440 
horizontal for that d-ring that goes in
there<00:03:48.530> so<00:03:48.800> go<00:03:49.550> ahead<00:03:49.670> and<00:03:49.760> tighten<00:03:49.880> it<00:03:50.060> up

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
there so go ahead and tighten it up

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.050 
there so go ahead and tighten it up
I<00:03:50.480> think<00:03:50.720> you'd<00:03:50.810> call<00:03:50.840> this<00:03:51.050> for<00:03:51.290> the<00:03:51.349> 40<00:03:52.060> pound

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
I think you'd call this for the 40 pound

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.550 
I think you'd call this for the 40 pound
feet<00:03:54.519> as<00:03:55.519> far<00:03:55.790> as<00:03:56.030> the<00:03:56.120> torque<00:03:56.360> goes<00:03:56.599> I'm<00:03:57.170> so

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
feet as far as the torque goes I'm so

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.440 
feet as far as the torque goes I'm so
good<00:03:59.560> so<00:04:00.560> I<00:04:00.590> just<00:04:00.860> got<00:04:01.040> done<00:04:01.069> talking<00:04:01.450> which

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
good so I just got done talking which

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.970 
good so I just got done talking which
what<00:04:02.600> I<00:04:02.630> said<00:04:02.870> earlier<00:04:03.230> about<00:04:03.260> it's<00:04:03.890> a<00:04:04.660> 65<00:04:05.660> foot

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
what I said earlier about it's a 65 foot

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.759 
what I said earlier about it's a 65 foot
pound<00:04:06.980> further<00:04:07.880> torque<00:04:08.209> so<00:04:08.959> we<00:04:09.170> got<00:04:09.290> this<00:04:09.500> em

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
pound further torque so we got this em

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.289 
pound further torque so we got this em
all<00:04:09.950> torqued<00:04:10.280> up<00:04:10.459> and<00:04:11.420> we<00:04:11.540> got<00:04:11.690> this<00:04:11.870> whole

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
all torqued up and we got this whole

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:15.820 
all torqued up and we got this whole
horizontal<00:04:14.299> so<00:04:14.630> he'll<00:04:15.260> be<00:04:15.380> nice<00:04:15.500> for<00:04:15.739> the

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
horizontal so he'll be nice for the

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.259 
horizontal so he'll be nice for the
d-ring<00:04:16.130> so<00:04:16.630> so<00:04:17.630> we<00:04:17.720> got<00:04:17.870> that<00:04:18.049> you<00:04:19.090> clip<00:04:20.090> up

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
d-ring so so we got that you clip up

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.659 
d-ring so so we got that you clip up
there<00:04:20.510> and<00:04:20.720> still<00:04:20.989> gonna<00:04:21.950> make<00:04:22.130> sure<00:04:22.310> that<00:04:22.460> the

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
there and still gonna make sure that the

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:24.490 
there and still gonna make sure that the
threads<00:04:23.030> are<00:04:23.300> facing<00:04:23.720> the<00:04:23.930> inside<00:04:24.320> of<00:04:24.440> the

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
threads are facing the inside of the

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.870 
threads are facing the inside of the
vehicle

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
vehicle

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.129 
vehicle
this<00:04:26.419> was<00:04:26.870> torque<00:04:27.260> to<00:04:27.440> 40<00:04:27.800> foot<00:04:28.040> pounds<00:04:29.080> now<00:04:30.080> we

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
this was torque to 40 foot pounds now we

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:31.240 
this was torque to 40 foot pounds now we
got<00:04:30.350> the<00:04:30.440> lower<00:04:30.620> and<00:04:30.800> the<00:04:30.830> upper<00:04:30.889> all

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
got the lower and the upper all

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.890 
got the lower and the upper all
connected<00:04:31.820> so<00:04:31.940> now<00:04:32.090> we<00:04:32.150> just<00:04:32.270> need<00:04:32.570> to<00:04:32.660> put<00:04:32.810> the

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
connected so now we just need to put the

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.320 
connected so now we just need to put the
connection<00:04:33.200> in<00:04:33.470> there<00:04:33.850> and<00:04:34.850> adjust<00:04:35.180> it

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
connection in there and adjust it

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.900 
connection in there and adjust it
properly<00:04:35.950> so<00:04:36.950> here's<00:04:37.160> the<00:04:37.310> finished<00:04:37.640> product

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
properly so here's the finished product

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.529 
properly so here's the finished product
I<00:04:38.710> connected<00:04:39.710> the<00:04:39.890> quick<00:04:40.160> disconnect<00:04:40.760> to<00:04:41.210> the

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:41.539 
I connected the quick disconnect to the

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:43.120 
I connected the quick disconnect to the
u-shaped<00:04:42.020> bracket<00:04:42.530> that<00:04:42.620> goes<00:04:42.680> up<00:04:42.979> to<00:04:43.010> the

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
u-shaped bracket that goes up to the

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.590 
u-shaped bracket that goes up to the
sway<00:04:43.460> bar<00:04:43.960> that<00:04:45.669> nut<00:04:46.669> there<00:04:47.030> the<00:04:47.210> bolt<00:04:47.450> that

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
sway bar that nut there the bolt that

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.330 
sway bar that nut there the bolt that
runs<00:04:47.720> through<00:04:48.020> there<00:04:48.229> that's<00:04:48.410> torque<00:04:48.860> to<00:04:49.010> 40

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
runs through there that's torque to 40

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.700 
runs through there that's torque to 40
foot<00:04:49.520> pounds<00:04:50.020> when<00:04:51.020> you're<00:04:51.169> adjusting<00:04:51.410> your

quick<00:04:51.950> disconnects<00:04:52.600> you<00:04:53.600> want<00:04:53.780> to<00:04:53.870> have<00:04:53.990> your

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
quick disconnects you want to have your

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:58.680 
quick disconnects you want to have your
sway<00:04:54.410> bar<00:04:54.740> sit<00:04:55.490> between<00:04:55.669> 5<00:04:56.330> to<00:04:56.630> 15<00:04:57.110> degrees

sway bar sit between 5 to 15 degrees
that's<00:04:59.690> what<00:04:59.810> they<00:04:59.930> recommend<00:05:00.350> I<00:05:00.440> think<00:05:01.060> 13<00:05:02.060> is

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
that's what they recommend I think 13 is

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.510 
that's what they recommend I think 13 is
what<00:05:03.169> they<00:05:03.410> really<00:05:03.680> wanted<00:05:04.010> that<00:05:04.070> so<00:05:04.610> anyhow

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
what they really wanted that so anyhow

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.159 
what they really wanted that so anyhow

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
did that now one of the nice things

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:11.320 
did that now one of the nice things
about<00:05:09.590> these<00:05:09.919> quick<00:05:10.400> disconnects<00:05:11.000> is<00:05:11.180> the

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
about these quick disconnects is the

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.170 
about these quick disconnects is the
fact<00:05:11.630> that<00:05:11.780> they're<00:05:12.380> adjustable<00:05:12.970> right<00:05:13.970> now

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
fact that they're adjustable right now

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.159 
fact that they're adjustable right now
my<00:05:14.389> Jeep<00:05:14.660> is<00:05:14.900> at<00:05:15.050> a<00:05:15.080> factory<00:05:15.680> height<00:05:16.010> I<00:05:17.020> plan<00:05:18.020> on

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
my Jeep is at a factory height I plan on

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:21.010 
my Jeep is at a factory height I plan on
doing<00:05:18.229> a<00:05:18.590> two<00:05:18.800> inch<00:05:19.039> old<00:05:19.430> man<00:05:19.610> EMU<00:05:20.030> suspension

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
doing a two inch old man EMU suspension

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.640 
doing a two inch old man EMU suspension
lift<00:05:21.200> on<00:05:21.470> it<00:05:21.820> here<00:05:23.229> sometime<00:05:24.229> in<00:05:24.380> the<00:05:24.500> near

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
lift on it here sometime in the near

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.480 
lift on it here sometime in the near
future<00:05:24.889> so<00:05:25.400> these<00:05:26.210> really<00:05:27.070> work<00:05:28.070> out<00:05:28.220> well<00:05:28.460> for

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
future so these really work out well for

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.610 
future so these really work out well for
me<00:05:28.789> just<00:05:29.210> because<00:05:29.570> they're<00:05:29.780> adjustable<00:05:30.440> and

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
me just because they're adjustable and

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.000 
me just because they're adjustable and
that<00:05:31.030> a<00:05:32.030> few<00:05:32.960> months<00:05:33.200> down<00:05:33.350> the<00:05:33.410> road<00:05:33.560> when<00:05:33.950> I

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
that a few months down the road when I

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.630 
that a few months down the road when I
get<00:05:34.160> my<00:05:34.280> lift<00:05:34.490> I<00:05:34.669> won't<00:05:34.820> have<00:05:35.000> to

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
get my lift I won't have to

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.060 
get my lift I won't have to
change<00:05:36.640> out<00:05:36.880> these<00:05:37.030> quick<00:05:37.330> disconnects<00:05:38.070> for

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
change out these quick disconnects for

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.010 
change out these quick disconnects for
another<00:05:39.340> pair<00:05:39.640> so<00:05:39.940> that<00:05:40.120> that's<00:05:40.510> really<00:05:40.810> what

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
another pair so that that's really what

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.940 
another pair so that that's really what
drew<00:05:41.560> me<00:05:41.740> to<00:05:42.360> to<00:05:43.360> these<00:05:43.510> quick<00:05:44.320> disconnects

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:44.950 
drew me to to these quick disconnects

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:49.170 
drew me to to these quick disconnects
the<00:05:45.220> jks<00:05:46.150> ones<00:05:47.550> so<00:05:48.550> another<00:05:48.970> thing<00:05:49.000> that's

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
the jks ones so another thing that's

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.820 
the jks ones so another thing that's
really<00:05:49.390> nice<00:05:49.660> about<00:05:49.720> these<00:05:50.170> is<00:05:50.290> they've<00:05:50.650> got

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
really nice about these is they've got

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.600 
really nice about these is they've got
the<00:05:51.390> places<00:05:52.390> to<00:05:52.600> grease<00:05:53.070> grease<00:05:54.070> them<00:05:54.280> up<00:05:54.400> both

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
the places to grease grease them up both

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.970 
the places to grease grease them up both
on<00:05:54.880> the<00:05:55.000> upper<00:05:55.420> and<00:05:55.510> lower<00:05:55.630> most<00:05:56.260> of<00:05:56.470> that<00:05:56.950> I

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:56.980 
on the upper and lower most of that I

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.540 
on the upper and lower most of that I
looked<00:05:57.310> at<00:05:57.460> didn't<00:05:57.760> have<00:05:57.910> that<00:05:58.120> so

00:05:59.540 --> 00:05:59.550 
looked at didn't have that so

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.530 
looked at didn't have that so
lubrication<00:06:00.550> is<00:06:00.640> always<00:06:00.850> a<00:06:00.880> good<00:06:01.090> thing<00:06:01.120> to

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:01.540 
lubrication is always a good thing to

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.410 
lubrication is always a good thing to
have<00:06:01.980> they<00:06:02.980> recommend<00:06:03.550> that<00:06:03.730> the<00:06:03.940> fur<00:06:04.120> the

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:04.420 
have they recommend that the fur the

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:05.910 
have they recommend that the fur the
first<00:06:04.660> three<00:06:04.930> months<00:06:05.110> and<00:06:05.440> the<00:06:05.500> braking

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:05.920 
first three months and the braking

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.830 
first three months and the braking
period<00:06:06.310> that<00:06:06.460> you<00:06:06.670> keep<00:06:07.480> them<00:06:07.660> well

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 
period that you keep them well

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:08.640 
period that you keep them well
lubricated

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:08.650 
lubricated

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.570 
lubricated
oh<00:06:09.930> no<00:06:10.930> I'll<00:06:11.350> show<00:06:11.590> you<00:06:11.650> I'll<00:06:12.040> show<00:06:12.130> you<00:06:12.310> what

oh no I'll show you I'll show you what
makes<00:06:12.730> these<00:06:13.000> cool<00:06:13.270> or<00:06:13.540> I<00:06:14.430> guess<00:06:15.430> how<00:06:15.850> quick

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:16.180 
makes these cool or I guess how quick

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.420 
makes these cool or I guess how quick
these<00:06:16.330> can<00:06:16.570> disconnect<00:06:17.050> you<00:06:17.890> just<00:06:18.070> pop<00:06:18.250> this

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
these can disconnect you just pop this

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.600 
these can disconnect you just pop this
d-ring<00:06:18.910> out<00:06:19.380> and<00:06:20.380> then<00:06:20.800> just<00:06:21.040> slide<00:06:21.310> them<00:06:21.490> on

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:21.610 
d-ring out and then just slide them on

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.120 
d-ring out and then just slide them on
out<00:06:21.870> and<00:06:22.870> boom<00:06:23.080> they're<00:06:23.290> disconnected<00:06:23.710> you'd

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:24.130 
out and boom they're disconnected you'd

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:25.620 
out and boom they're disconnected you'd
have<00:06:24.280> to<00:06:24.400> do<00:06:24.520> that<00:06:24.670> to<00:06:24.820> the<00:06:24.940> other<00:06:25.090> side<00:06:25.180> to<00:06:25.540> you

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:25.630 
have to do that to the other side to you

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:32.120 
have to do that to the other side to you
and<00:06:26.020> then<00:06:26.770> they<00:06:27.580> also<00:06:27.790> come<00:06:28.780> with<00:06:28.810> a<00:06:29.500> mounting

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.130 
and then they also come with a mounting

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:35.720 
and then they also come with a mounting
bar<00:06:33.130> that<00:06:33.430> you<00:06:33.550> can<00:06:33.760> mount<00:06:34.030> onto<00:06:34.480> your<00:06:34.630> frame<00:06:34.990> I

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:35.730 
bar that you can mount onto your frame I

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.710 
bar that you can mount onto your frame I
haven't<00:06:36.730> done<00:06:36.850> it<00:06:37.030> yet<00:06:37.120> just<00:06:37.390> because<00:06:37.690> I

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:37.720 
haven't done it yet just because I

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.780 
haven't done it yet just because I
didn't<00:06:37.990> have<00:06:38.110> the<00:06:38.140> right<00:06:38.380> drill<00:06:38.740> bit<00:06:38.950> in<00:06:39.190> the

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:39.790 
didn't have the right drill bit in the

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:45.500 
didn't have the right drill bit in the
tap<00:06:40.090> but<00:06:40.480> you<00:06:40.600> cannot<00:06:41.130> you<00:06:42.130> can<00:06:42.310> you<00:06:43.180> can<00:06:44.040> put<00:06:45.040> a

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:45.510 
tap but you cannot you can you can put a

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:48.000 
tap but you cannot you can you can put a
mount<00:06:46.510> here<00:06:46.840> and<00:06:47.020> then<00:06:47.140> you<00:06:47.290> can<00:06:47.410> mount<00:06:47.650> it<00:06:47.800> to

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.010 
mount here and then you can mount it to

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.310 
mount here and then you can mount it to
the<00:06:48.970> frame<00:06:49.360> when<00:06:49.600> you're<00:06:49.750> not<00:06:49.900> when<00:06:50.200> they're

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:50.320 
the frame when you're not when they're

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.930 
the frame when you're not when they're
disconnected<00:06:50.800> so<00:06:51.280> you're<00:06:51.460> out<00:06:51.580> of<00:06:51.610> the<00:06:51.790> way

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:51.940 
disconnected so you're out of the way

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:56.010 
disconnected so you're out of the way
which<00:06:52.720> is<00:06:52.870> nice<00:06:54.030> but<00:06:55.030> not<00:06:55.360> everything<00:06:55.840> worked

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:56.020 
which is nice but not everything worked

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.920 
which is nice but not everything worked
out<00:06:56.200> good<00:06:56.470> i<00:06:57.070> greased<00:06:57.850> him<00:06:58.090> up<00:06:58.270> and<00:06:58.510> I<00:06:58.600> took<00:06:58.660> it

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:58.930 
out good i greased him up and I took it

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.070 
out good i greased him up and I took it
out<00:06:59.050> for<00:06:59.380> a<00:06:59.410> drive<00:06:59.770> and<00:07:00.660> I<00:07:01.660> noticed<00:07:01.960> a<00:07:02.050> big

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:02.080 
out for a drive and I noticed a big

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.630
