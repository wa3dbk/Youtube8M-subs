00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:13.610
 hello that such good morning I'm ramÃ³n 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:15.769
 vicente technical director of security and 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.890
 We are in our factory where 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:21.050
 we produce the dishes that we distribute and 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.849
 that we supply and I am going to teach you 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.529
 what are the processes of your 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:26.300
 manufacturing 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.880
 these dishes are totally 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.920
 anti-slip 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.340
 [Music] 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:36.100
 In principle we start by applying a 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.150
 sen product with in front of our 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.090
 molds 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:44.870
 molds that already have the texture that goes to 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:47.210
 stay on the surface of the plate 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.090
 the second step is the application of 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:55.629
 product called if the coar that is the 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.629
 that gives the final tonality to the dish 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:09.390
 [Music] 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.990
 we are in the third step as we can 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.690
 see the ward gel has already been applied and 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.990
 In addition already has polimedicados 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:31.770
 hardened with which we begin to 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:35.270
 alternately apply layers of fiber 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.270
 with resin 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.500
 [Music] 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:03.620
 in this step the successive 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:09.149
 layers of fiberglass and resins 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:13.049
 [Music] 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:15.959
 the soul of the plate is placed 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:17.459
 It is a tano puree and is reinforced with 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.769
 different types of materials 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.629
 depending on the design of the plate you can 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.760
 be that when giving can be fiber of 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:26.100
 carbon as is this case 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.100
 [Music] 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.930
 finally and after having made the re 

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:39.450
 barbado of the edges of the plate 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.520
 proceeds to drill the hole in the 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.220
 valve 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:46.620
 [Music] 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.320
 the valves that we use in safety 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.690
 are high flow valves are 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.550
 subject to European regulations and that 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.030
 placed in the final installation at home 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.030
 of the client 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.419
