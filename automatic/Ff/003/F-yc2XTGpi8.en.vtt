50 years of technology and where we've

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.750 
50 years of technology and where we've

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:09.470 
said in the next five years we'll see

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:11.380 
said in the next five years we'll see
more<00:07:09.830> change<00:07:10.220> than<00:07:10.610> we've<00:07:11.030> seen<00:07:11.060> in<00:07:11.240> the<00:07:11.330> last

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:11.390 
more change than we've seen in the last

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:14.290 
more change than we've seen in the last
50<00:07:11.990> and<00:07:12.340> I've<00:07:13.340> seen<00:07:13.520> that<00:07:13.700> happening<00:07:14.150> in<00:07:14.240> the

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:14.300 
50 and I've seen that happening in the

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.770 
50 and I've seen that happening in the
last<00:07:14.510> two<00:07:14.780> so<00:07:15.700> who<00:07:16.700> know<00:07:16.820> the<00:07:17.030> future<00:07:17.390> holds

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:17.780 
last two so who know the future holds

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.110 
last two so who know the future holds
but<00:07:17.960> it's<00:07:18.770> all<00:07:18.980> changing<00:07:19.490> we<00:07:19.580> have<00:07:19.610> to<00:07:19.820> evolve

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:20.120 
but it's all changing we have to evolve

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.750 
but it's all changing we have to evolve
and<00:07:20.710> sometimes<00:07:21.710> to<00:07:21.890> evolve<00:07:22.190> it<00:07:22.310> means<00:07:22.490> going

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:22.760 
and sometimes to evolve it means going

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.700 
and sometimes to evolve it means going
back<00:07:23.000> and<00:07:23.210> doing<00:07:23.360> your<00:07:23.570> research<00:07:23.780> and<00:07:24.200> looking

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:24.710 
back and doing your research and looking

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:26.230 
back and doing your research and looking
at<00:07:24.860> history<00:07:25.340> and<00:07:25.370> seeing<00:07:25.760> where<00:07:25.880> we've<00:07:26.000> been

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:26.240 
at history and seeing where we've been

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.810 
at history and seeing where we've been
so<00:07:26.930> we<00:07:26.990> can<00:07:27.080> go<00:07:27.200> forward<00:07:27.530> and<00:07:27.890> I'm<00:07:28.490> doing<00:07:28.640> more

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:28.820 
so we can go forward and I'm doing more

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.950 
so we can go forward and I'm doing more
than<00:07:29.060> now<00:07:29.240> doing<00:07:29.660> more<00:07:29.780> research<00:07:30.200> and<00:07:30.550> and

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:31.960 
than now doing more research and and

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.420 
than now doing more research and and
learning<00:07:32.960> have<00:07:33.170> tailed<00:07:33.380> better<00:07:33.620> stories<00:07:34.100> I

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:34.430 
learning have tailed better stories I

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.790 
learning have tailed better stories I
think<00:07:35.330> in<00:07:35.720> photography<00:07:36.410> and<00:07:36.590> still

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:36.800
