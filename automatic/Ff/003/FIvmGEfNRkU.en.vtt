00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:08.500
 yes 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.500

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.770
 Hi, how are you and Karla Laura understand 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.560
 with firm many thanks for being 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.720
 here in this series of three videos I'm going to 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.060
 talk to you about the six basic needs 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.490
 emotional this time we're going to 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.869
 start with the first two understand 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.360
 these needs will help you 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:31.119
 very much so that you can find 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.280
 balance in your life and especially for 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.280
 that you realize the great power that 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.980
 exists within you then let's start 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.769
 in this video of a series of three with 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:45.640
 the two basic emotional needs 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:47.860
 first 1 certainty all beings 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.550
 humans we need in some way 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:54.700
 have this feeling of routine habits 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.320
 this security really that area of 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.870
 comfort in which all people 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.850
 they say it's negative to be there I 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.430
 I'm going to share something, it's really that 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.490
 we need to have something where 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.440
 let's know that we are safe an area of 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.930
 security or a strategy area 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.640
 then the first basic need 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.530
 emotional that you have and that you 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.350
 I recommend that you start looking 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.600
 or you cover is the need for certainty 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.490
 because many times when 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.860
 people say is it's not like being 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.200
 alone or I do not know how it is so alone is 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.970
 precisely because within them there 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.430
 they have covered the need to 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.470
 strategy seeks within you how 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.690
 you can generate habits how can you 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.149
 generate routines how you can start 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.560
 do a series of things 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:40.240
 consistently that they contribute 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.850
 happiness and that they give you results 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.520
 that make you feel good that would be the 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.100
 first need however beings 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.440
 humans we are just a little bit complex 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.020
 then we need the second 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.600
 basic emotional need that is the 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.179
 need for uncertainty think about 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.800
 this if all things are habits and 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:01.869
 routines what happens is that the 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.850
 people get bored and that's why 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.220
 you need to think about the second need 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.920
 basic that is the need to make yourself 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.650
 as you as the coubre can be a 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.989
 need for emotional uncertainty or 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.390
 a need for physical uncertainty 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.549
 Then look for the way to do 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.770
 different things that bring this 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:22.470
 variety 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.540
 Think about it well the variety is one of the 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.390
 things that bring flavor to life then 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.060
 learn to enjoy and they exactly 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.640
 take that step outside that area of 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.830
 comfort is not leaving it is simply 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.860
 start to prove what is there 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.920
 for you let's practice this week 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.110
 with these two basic needs 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.030
 beer and variety as certainty for 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.150
 that you begin to find that power that 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.820
 is inside you remember to give us like 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.100
