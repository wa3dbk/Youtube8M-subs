00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
like to place their units on with the

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.450 
like to place their units on with the
comb<00:01:48.630> even<00:01:48.960> though<00:01:49.049> I<00:01:49.229> don't<00:01:49.290> but<00:01:49.860> I<00:01:49.979> did<00:01:50.310> you

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
comb even though I don't but I did you

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.090 
comb even though I don't but I did you
the<00:01:50.490> adjustable<00:01:51.030> straps<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:52.590> find<00:01:52.890> that

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
the adjustable straps and I find that

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.760 
the adjustable straps and I find that
that<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:54.329> most<00:01:54.540> accurate<00:01:54.930> way<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.619> I
