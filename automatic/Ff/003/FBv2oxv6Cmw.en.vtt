of<00:03:22.230> revival<00:03:22.800> of<00:03:22.890> the<00:03:23.010> foamposites<00:03:23.670> and<00:03:23.820> this

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
of revival of the foamposites and this

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.600 
of revival of the foamposites and this
is<00:03:24.120> definitely<00:03:24.329> a<00:03:24.630> great<00:03:24.870> start<00:03:25.230> I<00:03:25.410> do<00:03:26.130> have<00:03:26.549> a

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
is definitely a great start I do have a

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.160 
is definitely a great start I do have a
feeling<00:03:26.940> though<00:03:27.060> it's<00:03:27.329> it's<00:03:27.690> still<00:03:27.989> going<00:03:28.110> to

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
feeling though it's it's still going to

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.170 
feeling though it's it's still going to
be<00:03:28.260> wishy-washy<00:03:29.220> whether<00:03:29.610> or<00:03:29.760> not<00:03:29.850> some<00:03:30.090> of

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
be wishy-washy whether or not some of

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.970 
be wishy-washy whether or not some of
the<00:03:30.239> other<00:03:30.420> ones<00:03:30.660> sell<00:03:31.410> out<00:03:31.560> or<00:03:31.680> not<00:03:31.799> because

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
the other ones sell out or not because

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.100

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
back part of the NYC it looks a little

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.760 
back part of the NYC it looks a little
bit<00:05:05.790> off<00:05:05.970> it<00:05:06.210> doesn't<00:05:06.510> look<00:05:06.630> like<00:05:06.690> NYC<00:05:07.320> it

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
bit off it doesn't look like NYC it

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.690 
bit off it doesn't look like NYC it
looks<00:05:07.980> like<00:05:08.870> the<00:05:09.870> e<00:05:10.200> is<00:05:10.530> like<00:05:11.100> cut<00:05:11.310> off<00:05:11.460> in<00:05:11.669> the

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
looks like the e is like cut off in the

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.090 
looks like the e is like cut off in the
wrong<00:05:11.880> spot<00:05:12.300> so<00:05:12.510> it<00:05:12.630> looks<00:05:12.750> like<00:05:12.930> in<00:05:13.200> kind<00:05:13.980> of

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
wrong spot so it looks like in kind of

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:19.270 
wrong spot so it looks like in kind of
crooked<00:05:14.520> y<00:05:14.820> and<00:05:15.300> awkward<00:05:16.290> e<00:05:16.560> and<00:05:16.890> you<00:05:17.610> can<00:05:17.790> see

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
crooked y and awkward e and you can see

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.300 
crooked y and awkward e and you can see
it's<00:05:20.280> just<00:05:20.400> a<00:05:20.669> little<00:05:20.790> bit<00:05:21.030> different<00:05:21.720> than

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
it's just a little bit different than

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.670 
it's just a little bit different than
then<00:05:23.310> what<00:05:23.460> I<00:05:23.490> would<00:05:23.700> have<00:05:23.730> expected<00:05:23.850> but

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
then what I would have expected but

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.570 
then what I would have expected but
regardless<00:05:25.680> of<00:05:25.830> that<00:05:25.890> that's<00:05:26.250> the<00:05:26.340> only<00:05:26.460> thing

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
regardless of that that's the only thing

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.010 
regardless of that that's the only thing
that<00:05:26.760> I<00:05:26.790> thought<00:05:27.060> was<00:05:27.270> kind<00:05:27.480> of<00:05:27.600> off<00:05:27.810> a<00:05:27.840> little

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
that I thought was kind of off a little

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.510 
that I thought was kind of off a little
bit<00:05:28.169> but<00:05:28.410> I<00:05:28.590> love<00:05:28.800> the<00:05:28.919> concept<00:05:29.130> the<00:05:29.490> concept

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
bit but I love the concept the concept

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.520 
bit but I love the concept the concept
of<00:05:29.940> that<00:05:30.060> is<00:05:30.210> super<00:05:30.390> rad<00:05:30.690> and<00:05:30.930> somebody<00:05:31.440> else

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
of that is super rad and somebody else

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:32.810 
of that is super rad and somebody else
pointed<00:05:31.740> out<00:05:31.919> to<00:05:32.040> me<00:05:32.070> that<00:05:32.160> that's<00:05:32.400> actually
