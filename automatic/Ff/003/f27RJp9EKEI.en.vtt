output<00:01:59.279> the<00:02:00.149> two<00:02:00.299> ports<00:02:00.719> here<00:02:01.079> you<00:02:01.560> have<00:02:01.740> a<00:02:01.770> 1

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
output the two ports here you have a 1

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.419 
output the two ports here you have a 1
amp<00:02:02.939> in<00:02:03.179> a<00:02:03.539> for<00:02:03.810> amp<00:02:04.049> output<00:02:04.349> the<00:02:04.829> one<00:02:05.039> amp<00:02:05.219> is

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429 
amp in a for amp output the one amp is

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:07.099 
amp in a for amp output the one amp is
for<00:02:05.669> cell<00:02:06.209> phones<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.719> things<00:02:06.840> like<00:02:07.049> that

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:07.109 
for cell phones and things like that

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:10.069 
for cell phones and things like that
before<00:02:07.529> amp<00:02:08.039> is<00:02:08.280> for<00:02:08.690> tablets<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:09.869> bigger

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:10.079 
before amp is for tablets and bigger

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:12.170 
before amp is for tablets and bigger
devices<00:02:10.679> with<00:02:10.890> bigger<00:02:11.129> capacity<00:02:11.430> it's<00:02:12.000> just

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
devices with bigger capacity it's just

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.990 
devices with bigger capacity it's just
how<00:02:12.689> much<00:02:13.010> current<00:02:14.010> it<00:02:14.129> puts<00:02:14.370> out<00:02:14.519> to<00:02:14.730> charge

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
how much current it puts out to charge

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.440 
how much current it puts out to charge
you

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
you

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.280 
you
now<00:02:16.200> this<00:02:16.500> one<00:02:16.770> the<00:02:17.040> old<00:02:17.190> one<00:02:17.489> had<00:02:18.420> a<00:02:18.599> it<00:02:19.200> only

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
now this one the old one had a it only

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.790 
now this one the old one had a it only
had<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.560> 2<00:02:19.860> amp<00:02:20.069> output<00:02:20.340> for<00:02:20.910> tablets<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:21.800> it

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
had a 2 amp output for tablets and it

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.809 
had a 2 amp output for tablets and it
didn't<00:02:23.190> sense<00:02:23.550> your<00:02:24.390> device's<00:02:25.050> actual<00:02:25.890> output

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
didn't sense your device's actual output

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.750 
didn't sense your device's actual output
it<00:02:27.209> needs<00:02:27.590> so<00:02:28.590> it<00:02:28.769> doesn't<00:02:29.069> didn't<00:02:29.280> harm<00:02:29.519> it<00:02:29.670> or

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
it needs so it doesn't didn't harm it or

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.900 
it needs so it doesn't didn't harm it or
anything<00:02:30.000> it<00:02:30.390> just<00:02:30.420> it<00:02:31.050> wasn't<00:02:31.500> exactly<00:02:31.910> you

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
anything it just it wasn't exactly you

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.259 
anything it just it wasn't exactly you
know<00:02:33.030> as<00:02:33.269> accurate<00:02:33.959> as<00:02:34.080> this<00:02:34.230> one<00:02:34.849> so<00:02:35.849> I<00:02:35.880> like

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
know as accurate as this one so I like

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:37.970 
know as accurate as this one so I like
this<00:02:36.450> one<00:02:36.510> because<00:02:36.780> Lex<00:02:37.050> said<00:02:37.260> when<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:37.739> plug

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
this one because Lex said when you plug

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.699 
this one because Lex said when you plug
your<00:02:38.099> device<00:02:38.160> in<00:02:38.730> it<00:02:38.940> finds<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.630> exact<00:02:40.080> amp

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
your device in it finds the exact amp

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.660 
your device in it finds the exact amp
output<00:02:41.130> you<00:02:41.700> need<00:02:41.940> to<00:02:42.540> charge<00:02:42.840> that<00:02:43.110> battery

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
output you need to charge that battery

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.369 
output you need to charge that battery
efficiently<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:44.910> quickly<00:02:45.150> without<00:02:45.930> doing

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
efficiently and quickly without doing

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.890 
efficiently and quickly without doing
any<00:02:46.560> damage<00:02:46.860> to<00:02:47.069> it<00:02:47.280> so<00:02:48.239> that's<00:02:48.660> a<00:02:48.780> great

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
any damage to it so that's a great

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.570 
any damage to it so that's a great
addition<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.500> also<00:02:49.530> like<00:02:49.950> that<00:02:50.099> they<00:02:50.220> put<00:02:50.459> them

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
addition I also like that they put them

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.150 
addition I also like that they put them
on<00:02:50.730> a<00:02:51.239> little<00:02:51.780> farther<00:02:52.110> apart<00:02:52.380> because

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
on a little farther apart because

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.770 
on a little farther apart because
everybody<00:02:53.760> always<00:02:53.819> asked<00:02:54.329> me<00:02:54.420> when<00:02:54.569> they<00:02:54.630> use

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
everybody always asked me when they use

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.680 
everybody always asked me when they use
this<00:02:54.959> what<00:02:55.170> do<00:02:55.230> i<00:02:55.290> plug<00:02:55.560> into<00:02:55.829> what<00:02:56.160> do<00:02:56.220> i<00:02:56.340> do<00:02:56.690> I

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
this what do i plug into what do i do I

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.240 
this what do i plug into what do i do I
and<00:02:58.349> it'd<00:02:58.530> be<00:02:58.650> nice<00:02:58.799> if<00:02:58.829> they<00:02:59.069> actually

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
and it'd be nice if they actually

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.250 
and it'd be nice if they actually
labeled<00:02:59.819> that<00:02:59.940> you<00:03:00.150> know<00:03:00.269> like<00:03:00.480> for<00:03:00.900> phones

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
labeled that you know like for phones

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.210 
labeled that you know like for phones
and<00:03:01.739> label<00:03:02.370> this<00:03:02.489> one<00:03:02.700> for<00:03:02.910> tablets<00:03:03.420> I<00:03:04.380> don't

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
and label this one for tablets I don't

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.699 
and label this one for tablets I don't
think<00:03:05.310> putting<00:03:05.760> a<00:03:06.060> for<00:03:06.390> amp<00:03:06.599> if<00:03:06.930> you<00:03:07.500> hooked

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
think putting a for amp if you hooked

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.100 
think putting a for amp if you hooked
your<00:03:07.829> phone<00:03:08.040> into<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.430> four<00:03:08.730> amp<00:03:08.940> one<00:03:09.180> I<00:03:09.450> doubt

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
your phone into the four amp one I doubt

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.839 
your phone into the four amp one I doubt
it<00:03:10.140> hurt<00:03:10.560> it<00:03:10.709> now<00:03:10.890> with<00:03:11.069> this<00:03:11.190> new<00:03:11.250> sensing

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
it hurt it now with this new sensing

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:13.640 
it hurt it now with this new sensing
technology<00:03:12.510> so<00:03:12.720> I<00:03:12.750> guess<00:03:13.019> it<00:03:13.170> doesn't<00:03:13.500> matter

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
technology so I guess it doesn't matter

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.580 
technology so I guess it doesn't matter
either<00:03:13.920> side<00:03:14.310> when<00:03:14.519> you<00:03:14.610> plug<00:03:14.849> it<00:03:14.970> in<00:03:15.150> but<00:03:15.900> it'd

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
either side when you plug it in but it'd

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.470 
either side when you plug it in but it'd
be<00:03:16.650> nice<00:03:16.980> if<00:03:17.040> it<00:03:17.220> labels<00:03:17.670> it<00:03:17.819> but<00:03:18.000> anyways<00:03:18.299> for

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
be nice if it labels it but anyways for

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.910 
be nice if it labels it but anyways for
phones<00:03:18.750> just<00:03:18.989> use<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.349> one<00:03:19.500> amp<00:03:19.739> output

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
phones just use the one amp output

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.180 
phones just use the one amp output
bigger<00:03:20.850> devices<00:03:21.420> of<00:03:21.569> 4m<00:03:21.989> this<00:03:22.739> one<00:03:22.920> still<00:03:23.160> has

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
bigger devices of 4m this one still has

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.940 
bigger devices of 4m this one still has
the<00:03:23.549> battery<00:03:23.910> I<00:03:24.180> mean<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:24.989> flashlight<00:03:25.709> which

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
the battery I mean the flashlight which

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.900 
the battery I mean the flashlight which
is<00:03:26.069> very<00:03:26.280> cool<00:03:26.579> and<00:03:26.940> then<00:03:27.510> I<00:03:28.760> think<00:03:29.760> you<00:03:29.819> have

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
is very cool and then I think you have

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.819 
is very cool and then I think you have
to<00:03:29.970> plug<00:03:30.209> something<00:03:30.239> into<00:03:30.750> it<00:03:31.019> here<00:03:33.680> to<00:03:34.680> get

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
to plug something into it here to get

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.590 
to plug something into it here to get
the<00:03:34.950> rest<00:03:35.130> to<00:03:35.340> come<00:03:35.519> on<00:03:35.670> but<00:03:35.940> it<00:03:36.030> has<00:03:36.150> a<00:03:36.180> group

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
the rest to come on but it has a group

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.960 
the rest to come on but it has a group
of<00:03:36.720> LEDs<00:03:37.200> right<00:03:37.530> here<00:03:37.920> that<00:03:38.370> show<00:03:38.579> how<00:03:38.819> much

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
of LEDs right here that show how much

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.199 
of LEDs right here that show how much
power<00:03:39.299> it's<00:03:39.660> got<00:03:39.840> left<00:03:40.049> in<00:03:40.290> it<00:03:40.639> and<00:03:41.639> it's<00:03:42.000> got

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
power it's got left in it and it's got

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.120 
power it's got left in it and it's got
it's<00:03:42.389> just<00:03:42.569> a<00:03:42.660> blue<00:03:42.840> LED<00:03:43.350> and<00:03:43.560> it<00:03:43.650> shows<00:03:43.829> that

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
it's just a blue LED and it shows that

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.819 
it's just a blue LED and it shows that
the<00:03:44.310> battery<00:03:44.910> life<00:03:45.150> left<00:03:45.180> this<00:03:46.109> one<00:03:46.319> here<00:03:46.620> I

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
the battery life left this one here I

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:51.020 
the battery life left this one here I
have<00:03:47.130> I<00:03:47.489> have<00:03:48.269> the<00:03:48.450> old<00:03:48.720> droid<00:03:49.590> Maxx<00:03:50.010> and<00:03:50.400> this
