00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.980 
this here is horseweed I just recently
found<00:00:14.830> out<00:00:16.320> how<00:00:17.320> to<00:00:17.380> identify<00:00:17.620> it<00:00:18.130> I<00:00:18.990> always

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:19.990 
found out how to identify it I always

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.599 
found out how to identify it I always
thought<00:00:20.200> I<00:00:20.260> knew<00:00:20.530> what<00:00:20.560> it<00:00:20.710> was<00:00:20.950> but<00:00:21.310> I<00:00:21.369> wasn't

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:21.609 
thought I knew what it was but I wasn't

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:25.169 
thought I knew what it was but I wasn't
quite<00:00:21.880> sure<00:00:23.039> this<00:00:24.039> is<00:00:24.220> what<00:00:24.429> a<00:00:24.640> lot<00:00:24.820> of<00:00:24.880> folks

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:25.179 
quite sure this is what a lot of folks

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:29.730 
quite sure this is what a lot of folks
used<00:00:25.509> to<00:00:26.429> make<00:00:27.429> a<00:00:27.460> spindle<00:00:28.380> for<00:00:29.380> the<00:00:29.470> hand

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:29.740 
used to make a spindle for the hand

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:36.150 
used to make a spindle for the hand
drill<00:00:30.810> method<00:00:31.810> of<00:00:32.050> fire<00:00:32.500> starting<00:00:34.980> but<00:00:35.980> it's<00:00:36.100> a

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
drill method of fire starting but it's a

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:43.410 
drill method of fire starting but it's a
really<00:00:36.310> common<00:00:36.670> weed<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:41.079> just<00:00:41.379> has<00:00:42.420> Lance

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
really common weed it just has Lance

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.369 
really common weed it just has Lance
shaped<00:00:43.840> leaves<00:00:44.110> with<00:00:44.559> a<00:00:47.399> central<00:00:48.399> vein<00:00:48.670> that

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
shaped leaves with a central vein that

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.709 
shaped leaves with a central vein that
has<00:00:50.379> little<00:00:50.710> veins<00:00:51.070> running<00:00:53.250> all<00:00:54.250> around<00:00:54.719> in

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:55.719 
has little veins running all around in

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:02.310 
has little veins running all around in
it<00:00:58.199> when<00:00:59.199> it<00:00:59.320> starts<00:00:59.680> to<00:00:59.800> go<00:00:59.920> to<00:00:59.980> seed<00:01:00.370> it<00:01:01.320> gets

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
it when it starts to go to seed it gets

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:09.360 
it when it starts to go to seed it gets
these<00:01:02.530> long<00:01:03.280> shoots<00:01:03.820> up<00:01:04.239> near<00:01:04.510> the<00:01:04.540> top

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.370 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.550 

I<00:01:09.430> think<00:01:10.270> people<00:01:10.510> pick<00:01:10.900> these<00:01:11.110> when<00:01:11.410> they're

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
I think people pick these when they're

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.850 
I think people pick these when they're
green<00:01:11.980> and<00:01:12.630> let<00:01:13.630> them<00:01:13.840> dry<00:01:14.230> in<00:01:14.940> order<00:01:15.940> to<00:01:16.090> make

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
green and let them dry in order to make

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.280 
green and let them dry in order to make
spindles<00:01:17.860> out<00:01:18.040> of<00:01:18.190> them<00:01:18.810> but<00:01:19.810> I'm<00:01:20.080> not<00:01:20.260> a

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
spindles out of them but I'm not a

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.840 
spindles out of them but I'm not a
hundred<00:01:20.500> percent<00:01:20.650> sure<00:01:20.950> on<00:01:21.280> that<00:01:21.310> it's<00:01:21.700> a

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
hundred percent sure on that it's a

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.090 
hundred percent sure on that it's a
plant<00:01:22.120> that<00:01:22.240> I<00:01:22.330> haven't<00:01:22.720> really<00:01:22.870> messed<00:01:23.830> with

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
plant that I haven't really messed with

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.010 
plant that I haven't really messed with
I<00:01:24.310> haven't<00:01:24.610> really<00:01:24.730> messed<00:01:25.300> with<00:01:25.570> the<00:01:25.750> hand

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
I haven't really messed with the hand

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.280 
I haven't really messed with the hand
drill<00:01:26.850> method<00:01:27.850> of<00:01:27.940> fire<00:01:28.150> starting<00:01:28.690> either<00:01:28.900> but

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
drill method of fire starting either but

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.600 
drill method of fire starting either but
I<00:01:29.530> figured<00:01:30.430> I'd<00:01:30.520> show<00:01:30.790> that<00:01:31.030> real<00:01:31.270> quick<00:01:31.660> a
