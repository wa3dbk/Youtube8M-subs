00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.220 
towards our target we've received the
signal<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.300> walked<00:00:18.660> until<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:19.199> endpoint<00:00:21.230> now

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
signal and walked until the endpoint now

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.009 
signal and walked until the endpoint now
pressing<00:00:22.920> reset<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:24.060> we<00:00:24.359> get<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.779> initial

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
pressing reset and we get the initial

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.900 
pressing reset and we get the initial
starting<00:00:25.560> point<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.250> signal<00:00:28.519> we<00:00:29.519> mark<00:00:29.760> the

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
starting point of the signal we mark the

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:37.080 
starting point of the signal we mark the
place<00:00:30.119> where<00:00:30.420> we<00:00:30.570> get<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.960> signal

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.770 

then<00:00:37.720> end<00:00:38.020> the<00:00:38.260> signal<00:00:39.180> press<00:00:40.180> reset<00:00:40.630> again

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
then end the signal press reset again

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:51.200 
then end the signal press reset again
and<00:00:41.200> approach<00:00:42.130> towards<00:00:42.610> the<00:00:42.700> same<00:00:43.000> target

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.510 

now<00:00:51.810> we<00:00:51.870> will<00:00:52.260> repeat<00:00:52.740> these<00:00:52.950> steps<00:00:53.130> in

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
now we will repeat these steps in

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.460 
now we will repeat these steps in

reverse order palm that's not a family

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.380 
reverse order palm that's not a family
we<00:00:58.470> press<00:00:58.830> reset<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.580> approach<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.180> target

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
we press reset and approach the target

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.870 
we press reset and approach the target
shooter<00:01:02.390> okay<00:01:03.390> we<00:01:03.570> sense<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.989> signal

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.120 

now<00:01:08.780> we<00:01:08.840> will<00:01:09.140> end<00:01:09.380> the<00:01:09.530> signal<00:01:11.979> does<00:01:12.979> it

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
now we will end the signal does it

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.180 
now we will end the signal does it
elastic<00:01:13.700> and<00:01:13.939> approach<00:01:14.750> again<00:01:15.470> towards<00:01:16.040> the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.469 

we<00:01:22.530> now<00:01:22.740> determine<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.310> signal<00:01:23.760> diameter<00:01:24.299> of

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
we now determine the signal diameter of
