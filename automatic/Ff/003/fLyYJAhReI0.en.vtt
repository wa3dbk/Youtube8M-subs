00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.000
 hello you love here to a dino 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:19.010
 Eighth part of this ride cruiser series 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.509
 So it's about the red meadows clover that 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.820
 red giant play is a typical one 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:24.410
 picture in the summer on all because of me the 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.829
 name already says it is synonymous that 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.480
 much essential but I want the 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:31.849
 white-red taste speak because of that 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.470
 Namely, a lot of tasty tastes raw 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:37.359
 I would like to start telling you 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:39.590
 what do you ask how big the 

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:40.699
 statistical probability is that 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.600
 this is what happened to me today 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:45.829
 happened while I was one 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.879
 I made wild herbs hike 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.920
 I'm still a bit confused 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.510
 just try to classify that 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.969
 that me alone the universe there me 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.039
 The higher energy we want to say with 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:01:00.530
 So are on this meadow and walk 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:03.249
 collected meadows sticky as you seem 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.249
 nor a bird on the head 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.930
 that sits down now before the 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.670
 wet hair and I'm asking you now 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.750
 most how high the 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.880
 Probability is from one 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.740
 people that happens and secondly 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.630
 I really want to warn now 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.939
 we have the nature to go out there 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.070
 fly there dangerous animals and 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:23.479
 negative by side but I would now 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.770
 really interested in how high is the 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.210
 Probability that one 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.630
 that happens to a bird on his head 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.750
 had 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.549
 and does anyone have an idea what my 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.869
 things soldiers when I turned kart 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.090
 I have a lot of luck here 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:38.869
 if we have a bird on our heads anymore 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:41.689
 Give up your eyes so what something 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.759
 should we say that and that he has one 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:46.219
 small anecdote so I'll come back 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.780
 to the red meadows clover why would I like 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:48.979
 Imagine that I want you 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.630
 Imagine because the guys really 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.610
 Surprise but also the most delicious 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.560
 heard of wild herbs that I know the 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.060
 we are eating in the summer right now 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.439
 showed full as the name says 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.000
 they are like clover those red ones 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:04.039
 flowers taste very interesting very much 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.899
 sweet are also a total again 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:07.820
 enrichment for every salad 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.789
 especially with fruit no longer than 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.250
 also very good with fruit and mine 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.300
 children 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.120
 different ones are also very fruitful 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.600
 Do not do any medically they will 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.830
 used even so very little so 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.600
 they are used in chronic 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.730
 skin diseases just so on 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.820
 yes women who now have problems 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.330
 Change even complaints by case 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.130
 knew those are the biggest ones 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.320
 fields of application of these meadows clover 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.480
 and I think that is not to make it so 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.620
 Tastes delicious so looks good then 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.150
 however useful it is 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.600
 again a great combination 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.790
 pretty or who actually know each other 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.560
 would have and you just times 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.790
 should try almost the same color 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:53.160
 like my t-shirt yes otherwise 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.270
 said growing is that I have you who you are 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.320
 maybe you 'll see a video again 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.150
 how it looks 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.790
 it's just now my best video 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:05.090
 how it looks like when clover 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.090
 growing and demonstrating afterwards 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.440
 yes, typically I think that you are in peace 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.519
 as she does not mow it, too 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.470
 much smaller meadow clover 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.569
 but that's pretty much just how calm 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.790
 she with a very dense growing 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.260
 was there in the summer you can find 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.290
 this clover mainly I would you 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.019
 just use more often and eat is 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.629
 So as I said just for children 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:33.280
 something like children again 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:35.530
 through through the beauty through the 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.090
 Taste also at crosses gets so 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.709
 that was it from me today 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.319
 Lisa I would be happy if one 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:44.650
 or others - to what the day as today 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.970
 says I will therefore go young 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.599
 let's see that we everything happens there 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.829
 not good 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:53.319
 we will meet again in any case 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:55.989
 will go out to the meadows and in the 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.920
 next picture or video all you 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.269
 surprising about what kind of a 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.030
 wild herbs what the things tell 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:03.450
 wish you a healthy and wild herbs 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.450
 rich time
