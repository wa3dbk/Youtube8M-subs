press it into the cashews then lay about

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.350 
press it into the cashews then lay about
a<00:03:29.400> quarters<00:03:29.910> diameters<00:03:30.660> worth<00:03:30.930> of<00:03:31.170> fruit

horizontally<00:03:33.360> across<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:34.049> nori<00:03:35.420> then<00:03:36.420> we'll

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
horizontally across the nori then we'll

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.870 
horizontally across the nori then we'll
gently<00:03:36.780> roll<00:03:37.079> it<00:03:37.230> up<00:03:37.350> and<00:03:37.530> seal<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.190> ends

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.770 

sometimes<00:03:41.880> the<00:03:42.090> fruit<00:03:42.299> kind<00:03:42.570> of<00:03:42.660> gets

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
sometimes the fruit kind of gets

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.990 
sometimes the fruit kind of gets
squished<00:03:43.049> out<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.440> ends<00:03:43.769> so<00:03:43.920> here's<00:03:44.610> a<00:03:44.670> trick

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
squished out the ends so here's a trick

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.020 
squished out the ends so here's a trick
to<00:03:45.450> keep<00:03:45.660> it<00:03:45.810> all<00:03:45.959> in<00:03:46.200> one<00:03:46.350> place<00:03:46.820> line<00:03:47.820> up<00:03:48.000> your

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
to keep it all in one place line up your

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.259 
to keep it all in one place line up your
nori<00:03:48.360> roll<00:03:48.680> with<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:49.829> edge<00:03:50.010> of<00:03:50.190> your<00:03:50.340> mat

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.550 

there's<00:03:54.269> anything<00:03:54.480> sticking<00:03:54.870> out<00:03:55.079> just<00:03:55.350> push

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
there's anything sticking out just push

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.740 
there's anything sticking out just push
it<00:03:55.680> back<00:03:55.860> in<00:03:56.040> then<00:03:56.280> gently<00:03:56.670> roll<00:03:57.209> it<00:03:57.390> up<00:03:57.570> and

then push push everything back in on the
side<00:04:02.300> this<00:04:03.300> is<00:04:03.420> a<00:04:03.450> nice<00:04:03.690> way<00:04:03.870> to<00:04:03.930> slice<00:04:04.230> your

side this is a nice way to slice your
nori

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
nori

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.440

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
do it wipe it off in between so it

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.000 
do it wipe it off in between so it
doesn't<00:04:14.880> stick
