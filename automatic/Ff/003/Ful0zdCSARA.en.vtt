00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.179
 today we are going to talk about videogame 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.969
 probably you have already noticed in your life or in the life of a 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:15.749
 colleague of a brother of a crime 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:20.679
 that boy that girl or many times until that adult starts 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:23.970
 to use a video game in their leisure time 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.189
 Pirelli is nothing to much trouble. 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.339
 It happens that lashes the girl here these people start to use the video game 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.500
 many times they would lose their sense of proper use 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.140
 it is 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.630
 many people start using both the video game and so much so much that 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.490
 they would probably lose this ability to control stimuli and 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.300
 they would become dependent on video games 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.690
 barroso should think video game dependence does this exist 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.810
 being a lot of searching for iva is a very serious problem 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.880
 is something that occurs most often the goal is that these people 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.990
 begin to use the video game in an excessive way whether it is teenager or 

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:10.280
 adult they would start to stop doing things from the real world 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.590
 dedicate to the work stops dedicating itself to the school to stay playing 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.910
 over time in the virtual world and would begin to compete with the activities 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:20.820
 in the real world 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.490
 arrive at a particular time when this 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.380
 fall in love with adult would be practically imprisoned 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.980
 and then we would have installed a true psychological disorder 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.280
 the big idea is to stay tuned if you have anybody next 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.980
 You that start playing rather than meet with a friend 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.760
 another colleague of yours that you intend to know at lunch times 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.390
 worked work is playing instead of going to lunch with the class 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.520
 be aware that something is probably not going well 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.690
 these people in a general way 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.400
 would lose the ability to identify that this would have to become a problem 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.220
 then the icaraÃ­ beach stay tuned because you as well known colleague 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.660
 My friend, my father may be helping you a lot. 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.310
 this person to suggest some form of guidance
