00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
I don't think I I think it would a

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.670 
I don't think I I think it would a
little<00:00:20.039> bit<00:00:20.189> it<00:00:20.430> would<00:00:20.520> make<00:00:20.670> me<00:00:20.820> feel<00:00:21.590> maybe<00:00:22.590> a

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
little bit it would make me feel maybe a

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.830 
little bit it would make me feel maybe a
little<00:00:22.800> bit<00:00:22.949> less<00:00:23.100> comfortable<00:00:23.310> sure<00:00:24.029> because

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
that's why I take them off in the first

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.710 
that's why I take them off in the first
place<00:00:26.369> so<00:00:26.849> then<00:00:27.000> I<00:00:27.090> feel<00:00:27.269> like<00:00:27.480> more

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
happened when you were working with all

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.979 
happened when you were working with all
of<00:03:26.280> these<00:03:27.079> superstars<00:03:28.430> no<00:03:29.430> no<00:03:30.239> we're<00:03:30.720> very

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
boring I think the way that the world

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.920 
boring I think the way that the world
sees<00:03:33.900> these<00:03:34.290> superstars<00:03:35.329> is<00:03:36.329> not<00:03:36.630> the<00:03:36.810> way

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
sees these superstars is not the way

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.270 
sees these superstars is not the way
that<00:03:37.170> they<00:03:37.290> are<00:03:37.470> that's<00:03:37.920> what<00:03:38.040> I'm<00:03:38.130> realizing

that they are that's what I'm realizing

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.830 
that they are that's what I'm realizing
