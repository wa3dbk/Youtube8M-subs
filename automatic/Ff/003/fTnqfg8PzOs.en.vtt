the number of drugs that we take in this

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.130 
the number of drugs that we take in this
country<00:01:14.909> i'm<00:01:15.030> talking<00:01:15.330> about<00:01:15.360> prescription

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
country i'm talking about prescription

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.219 
country i'm talking about prescription
drugs<00:01:16.470> we<00:01:16.680> get<00:01:16.830> from<00:01:16.979> doctors<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.520> from

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
drugs we get from doctors and from

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.120 
drugs we get from doctors and from
psychiatrists<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.290> all<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.590> we're

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
psychiatrists and all that we're

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.249 
psychiatrists and all that we're
practically<00:01:20.580> doing<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.240> now<00:01:21.509> right<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:22.229> i

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
practically doing that now right so i

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.440 
practically doing that now right so i
think<00:01:22.320> it's<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.560> fairly<00:01:22.860> believable<00:01:23.549> world<00:01:23.880> to

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
think it's a fairly believable world to

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.600 
think it's a fairly believable world to
some<00:01:24.630> extent<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:25.979> just<00:01:26.009> think<00:01:26.369> that<00:01:26.520> her

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
some extent and I just think that her

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
some extent and I just think that her
world<00:01:26.880> makes<00:01:27.270> more<00:01:27.600> sense<00:01:28.250> in<00:01:29.630> divergent

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
world makes more sense in divergent

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
the time and it just didn't make much
