00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060 

you<00:00:00.390> know<00:00:00.510> it's<00:00:01.140> hard<00:00:01.439> to<00:00:01.560> figure<00:00:01.709> out<00:00:01.829> how<00:00:02.040> to

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
you know it's hard to figure out how to

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.160 
you know it's hard to figure out how to
teach<00:00:02.310> someone<00:00:02.550> to<00:00:02.820> be<00:00:02.909> grateful<00:00:03.720> how<00:00:04.110> to

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
teach someone to be grateful how to

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.230 
teach someone to be grateful how to
teach<00:00:04.350> someone<00:00:04.589> to<00:00:04.680> have<00:00:04.950> self-control<00:00:05.670> and

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
teach someone to have self-control and

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.240 
teach someone to have self-control and
in<00:00:06.569> lots<00:00:06.750> of<00:00:06.839> ways<00:00:06.899> I<00:00:06.990> think<00:00:07.170> it<00:00:07.500> may<00:00:07.680> look<00:00:07.980> very

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
in lots of ways I think it may look very

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.700 
in lots of ways I think it may look very
different<00:00:08.730> than<00:00:08.870> then<00:00:09.870> teaching<00:00:10.440> in<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.620> way

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
different than then teaching in the way

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.230 
different than then teaching in the way
that<00:00:10.860> we<00:00:10.950> generally<00:00:11.370> think<00:00:11.400> about<00:00:11.610> teaching<00:00:12.090> I

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
that we generally think about teaching I

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.120 
that we generally think about teaching I
mean<00:00:12.389> one<00:00:12.900> way<00:00:13.049> I<00:00:13.080> think<00:00:13.200> a<00:00:13.440> Kip<00:00:13.650> that<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:13.920> plays

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
mean one way I think a Kip that it plays

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.680 
mean one way I think a Kip that it plays
out<00:00:14.309> is<00:00:14.519> actually<00:00:14.639> in<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.120> discipline

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
out is actually in the discipline

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.439 
out is actually in the discipline
process<00:00:15.900> it's<00:00:16.410> so<00:00:16.590> when<00:00:17.100> kids<00:00:17.520> get<00:00:18.000> in<00:00:18.119> trouble

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
process it's so when kids get in trouble

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.099 
process it's so when kids get in trouble
they<00:00:19.380> now<00:00:19.650> use<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:20.490> character<00:00:21.240> language<00:00:21.689> to

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
they now use the character language to

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.080 
they now use the character language to
try<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.380> get<00:00:22.619> kids<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.039> think<00:00:23.369> about<00:00:23.609> why<00:00:23.850> they

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
try to get kids to think about why they

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.700 
try to get kids to think about why they
made<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.539> mistakes<00:00:24.869> they<00:00:25.080> made<00:00:25.289> how<00:00:25.500> they

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
made the mistakes they made how they

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.859 
made the mistakes they made how they
could<00:00:25.920> do<00:00:26.099> things<00:00:26.310> differently<00:00:26.660> and<00:00:27.660> it's

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
could do things differently and it's

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.980 
could do things differently and it's
almost<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.439> mean<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.830> reminded<00:00:29.369> me<00:00:29.429> of<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:30.480> lot<00:00:30.750> of

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
almost I mean it reminded me of a lot of

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.920 
almost I mean it reminded me of a lot of
the<00:00:31.850> metacognitive<00:00:32.850> techniques<00:00:33.690> of

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
the metacognitive techniques of

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.810 
the metacognitive techniques of
cognitive<00:00:34.380> behavioral<00:00:34.890> therapy<00:00:35.309> it's<00:00:35.550> really

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
cognitive behavioral therapy it's really

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.430 
cognitive behavioral therapy it's really
getting<00:00:36.120> kids<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.510> slow<00:00:36.899> down<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.380> think

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
getting kids to slow down and think

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.020 
getting kids to slow down and think
about<00:00:37.860> what<00:00:38.010> they're<00:00:38.160> doing<00:00:38.190> think<00:00:38.700> about<00:00:38.910> why

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
about what they're doing think about why

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.130 
about what they're doing think about why
they're<00:00:39.239> making<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.600> mistakes<00:00:39.930> they're

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
they're making the mistakes they're

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.920 
they're making the mistakes they're
making<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.850> change<00:00:41.850> themselves<00:00:42.090> so<00:00:42.780> that

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
making and change themselves so that

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.869 
making and change themselves so that
that<00:00:43.230> is<00:00:43.440> really<00:00:43.890> different<00:00:44.100> than<00:00:44.309> then

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
that is really different than then

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.700 
that is really different than then
traditional<00:00:45.510> teaching<00:00:45.899> in<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.230> classroom

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
traditional teaching in the classroom

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.709 
traditional teaching in the classroom
but<00:00:47.370> my<00:00:47.520> sense<00:00:47.760> actually<00:00:48.120> at<00:00:48.210> Kipp<00:00:48.450> in<00:00:48.600> other

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
but my sense actually at Kipp in other

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.690 
but my sense actually at Kipp in other
places<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.770> going<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:49.980> be<00:00:50.160> the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
places is that that is going to be the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.430 
places is that that is going to be the
tool<00:00:51.000> that's<00:00:51.210> most<00:00:51.449> effective<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.960> help<00:00:52.140> get

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
tool that's most effective to help get

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.529 
tool that's most effective to help get
these<00:00:52.559> take<00:00:53.190> us<00:00:53.309> inside<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.879> classroom<00:00:54.360> how

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
these take us inside the classroom how

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.569 
these take us inside the classroom how
do<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.750> see<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.079> unfold<00:00:55.469> right<00:00:55.649> so<00:00:55.980> I<00:00:56.010> think

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
do you see it unfold right so I think

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.580 
do you see it unfold right so I think
that's<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.090> mean<00:00:57.300> I'm<00:00:57.420> seeing<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.260> think<00:00:58.530> I

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
that's I mean I'm seeing it I think I

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.599 
that's I mean I'm seeing it I think I
think<00:00:58.739> it's<00:00:58.859> so<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.039> want<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.250> sort<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.489> make

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
think it's so you want to sort of make

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.099 
think it's so you want to sort of make
it<00:00:59.730> viral<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.390> sort<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.660> want<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:00.930> make<00:01:00.989> it

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
it viral you sort of want to make it

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.380 
it viral you sort of want to make it
part<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.590> culture<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.460> becomes<00:01:02.850> part

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
part of the culture so it becomes part

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.870 
part of the culture so it becomes part
of<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.750> I<00:01:03.989> mean<00:01:04.170> we've<00:01:05.129> tried<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.430> put<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.760> into

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
of the I mean we've tried to put it into

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.480 
of the I mean we've tried to put it into
the<00:01:06.680> some<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.830> language<00:01:08.159> into<00:01:08.369> our

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
the some of the language into our

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.100 
the some of the language into our
faculty<00:01:08.880> evaluation<00:01:09.450> systems<00:01:09.840> because<00:01:10.080> I

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
faculty evaluation systems because I

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.359 
faculty evaluation systems because I
think<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.439> faculty<00:01:10.860> I'm<00:01:10.950> actually<00:01:11.100> not

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
think that the faculty I'm actually not

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.149 
think that the faculty I'm actually not
modeling<00:01:11.939> these<00:01:12.470> character<00:01:13.470> strengths<00:01:13.950> then

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
modeling these character strengths then

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.370 
modeling these character strengths then
you<00:01:14.369> can't<00:01:14.580> expect<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.030> kids<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.390> do<00:01:15.509> that

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
you can't expect the kids to do that

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.940 
you can't expect the kids to do that
in<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.890> classroom<00:01:17.189> I<00:01:17.700> saw<00:01:18.090> just<00:01:19.020> recently<00:01:19.439> an

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
in a classroom I saw just recently an

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.980 
in a classroom I saw just recently an
eighth<00:01:20.130> grade<00:01:20.430> teacher<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:20.970> was<00:01:21.240> asking<00:01:21.750> she

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
eighth grade teacher that was asking she

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.590 
eighth grade teacher that was asking she
had<00:01:22.080> asked<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.590> kids<00:01:23.270> halfway<00:01:24.270> through<00:01:24.479> the

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
had asked the kids halfway through the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.990 
had asked the kids halfway through the
year<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.990> think<00:01:25.380> about<00:01:25.650> what<00:01:26.220> which<00:01:26.670> one<00:01:26.970> of

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
year to think about what which one of

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.270 
year to think about what which one of
these<00:01:27.210> strengths<00:01:27.869> had<00:01:28.049> played<00:01:28.409> out<00:01:28.650> in<00:01:28.890> their

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
these strengths had played out in their

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.130 
these strengths had played out in their
writing<00:01:29.880> workshopping<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:30.750> they<00:01:30.840> were<00:01:30.930> doing

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
writing workshopping so they were doing

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.830 
writing workshopping so they were doing
sort<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.350> revisions<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:32.100> writing<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.360> these

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
sort of revisions of writing and these

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.450 
sort of revisions of writing and these
kids<00:01:34.049> were<00:01:34.200> writing<00:01:34.530> these<00:01:34.650> sort<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:34.890> meta

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
kids were writing these sort of meta

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.030 
kids were writing these sort of meta
narratives<00:01:36.119> about<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:37.079> piece<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.799> work<00:01:38.009> that

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
narratives about that piece of work that

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.950 
narratives about that piece of work that
they<00:01:38.340> were<00:01:38.400> finishing<00:01:38.790> up<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.240> saying<00:01:39.450> okay<00:01:39.780> I

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
they were finishing up and saying okay I

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.410 
they were finishing up and saying okay I
you<00:01:40.590> know<00:01:40.680> felt<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.310> because<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.150> was<00:01:42.270> really

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
you know felt that because I was really

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.910 
you know felt that because I was really
curious<00:01:42.689> about<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.259> subject<00:01:43.470> that

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
curious about this subject that

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.200 
curious about this subject that
therefore<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.280> writing<00:01:44.610> turned<00:01:44.850> out<00:01:44.970> better

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
therefore the writing turned out better

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.210 
therefore the writing turned out better
and<00:01:45.509> then<00:01:45.840> they<00:01:45.930> actually<00:01:46.229> cared<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.680> revisit

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
and then they actually cared to revisit

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.830 
and then they actually cared to revisit
they<00:01:47.340> sort<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.549> had<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.759> revisit<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.329> process

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
they sort of had to revisit this process

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.660 
they sort of had to revisit this process
at<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.380> end<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.740> year<00:01:49.950> picking<00:01:50.549> out<00:01:50.610> a

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
at the end of the year picking out a

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.300 
at the end of the year picking out a
strength<00:01:51.119> or<00:01:51.329> two<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:52.020> was<00:01:52.170> good<00:01:52.950> for<00:01:53.130> them

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
strength or two that was good for them

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.679 
strength or two that was good for them
that<00:01:53.490> was<00:01:53.579> really<00:01:53.759> supportive<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.329> their<00:01:54.509> work

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
that was really supportive of their work

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:55.940 
that was really supportive of their work
on<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.899> strength<00:01:55.200> or<00:01:55.350> two<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.680> they<00:01:55.770> had

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
on a strength or two that they had

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.950 
on a strength or two that they had
problems<00:01:56.219> with<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:57.180> think<00:01:57.390> again<00:01:57.540> it's

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
problems with and I think again it's

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.499 
problems with and I think again it's
sort<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:58.229> suffused<00:01:59.009> in<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.880> school<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.479> think

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
sort of suffused in the school I think

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.389 
sort of suffused in the school I think
is<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.990> way<00:02:01.110> that<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.500> shouldn't<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:02.130> know<00:02:02.250> a

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
is the way that it shouldn't you know a

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.859 
is the way that it shouldn't you know a
lot<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.729> educational<00:02:03.270> ideas<00:02:03.540> it's<00:02:03.750> like

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
lot of educational ideas it's like

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.209 
lot of educational ideas it's like
you've<00:02:03.960> got<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.140> develop<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.469> new<00:02:04.590> course<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:05.100> new

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
you've got to develop a new course a new

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.059 
you've got to develop a new course a new
program<00:02:05.670> by<00:02:06.479> some<00:02:06.689> new<00:02:06.810> technology<00:02:07.409> I<00:02:07.619> mean<00:02:07.979> I

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
program by some new technology I mean I

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.770 
program by some new technology I mean I
think<00:02:08.129> something<00:02:08.910> like<00:02:09.060> this<00:02:09.209> it's<00:02:09.450> like<00:02:09.599> just

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
think something like this it's like just

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.680 
think something like this it's like just
how<00:02:09.989> do<00:02:10.050> we<00:02:10.349> change<00:02:11.039> our<00:02:11.489> language<00:02:12.180> how<00:02:12.420> do<00:02:12.480> we

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
how do we change our language how do we

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.270 
how do we change our language how do we
change<00:02:12.870> our<00:02:13.050> focus<00:02:13.290> a<00:02:13.650> bit<00:02:13.770> there's<00:02:13.950> a<00:02:14.010> lot<00:02:14.160> of

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
change our focus a bit there's a lot of

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.950 
change our focus a bit there's a lot of
things<00:02:14.490> going<00:02:14.700> on<00:02:14.850> in<00:02:14.910> schools<00:02:15.450> how<00:02:15.720> can<00:02:15.870> you

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
things going on in schools how can you

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.300 
things going on in schools how can you
focus<00:02:16.440> on<00:02:16.590> on<00:02:16.770> these<00:02:16.890> non-cognitive

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
focus on on these non-cognitive

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.900 
focus on on these non-cognitive
strengths<00:02:18.230> in<00:02:19.230> a<00:02:19.380> way<00:02:19.620> that's<00:02:20.250> sort<00:02:20.820> of

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
strengths in a way that's sort of

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.690 
strengths in a way that's sort of
cultural<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:21.600> pervasive<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:22.890> sort<00:02:23.220> of<00:02:23.250> viral

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
cultural and pervasive and sort of viral

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.250 
cultural and pervasive and sort of viral
and<00:02:23.850> teachers<00:02:24.180> run<00:02:24.390> with<00:02:24.540> this<00:02:24.660> stuff<00:02:24.930> I<00:02:25.140> mean

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
and teachers run with this stuff I mean

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.810 
and teachers run with this stuff I mean
it's<00:02:25.410> sort<00:02:25.470> of<00:02:25.560> amazing<00:02:26.040> I<00:02:26.100> mean<00:02:26.130> teachers

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
it's sort of amazing I mean teachers

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.550 
it's sort of amazing I mean teachers
have<00:02:26.940> been<00:02:27.090> using<00:02:27.540> this<00:02:27.750> on<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.080> playground

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
have been using this on the playground

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.920 
have been using this on the playground
during<00:02:28.740> recess<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.250> talking<00:02:29.850> to<00:02:30.300> kids<00:02:30.630> and

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
during recess and talking to kids and

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.260 
during recess and talking to kids and
about<00:02:31.170> how<00:02:31.620> they<00:02:31.860> need<00:02:32.040> to<00:02:32.100> be<00:02:32.270> more

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
about how they need to be more

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.030 
about how they need to be more
self-controlled<00:02:33.960> and<00:02:34.200> using<00:02:34.710> that<00:02:34.800> language

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
self-controlled and using that language

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.460 
self-controlled and using that language
even<00:02:35.550> with<00:02:35.670> very<00:02:35.910> very<00:02:36.210> young<00:02:36.840> very<00:02:37.200> very

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
even with very very young very very

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.200 
even with very very young very very
young<00:02:37.740> kids<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.190> I<00:02:38.250> think<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.790> earlier<00:02:39.150> you

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
young kids and I think the earlier you

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.450 
young kids and I think the earlier you
do<00:02:39.450> this<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.840> research<00:02:40.200> shows<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:41.070> better<00:02:41.280> it

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
do this the research shows the better it

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.660 
do this the research shows the better it
is

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
is

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:49.120 
is
um<00:02:41.940> so<00:02:43.100> wrestle<00:02:44.900> two<00:02:45.900> things<00:02:46.140> one<00:02:46.470> is<00:02:47.930> we

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
um so wrestle two things one is we

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.640 
um so wrestle two things one is we
absolutely<00:02:50.130> integrate<00:02:51.060> this<00:02:51.270> into<00:02:51.650> academic

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
absolutely integrate this into academic

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.470 
absolutely integrate this into academic
studies<00:02:53.010> so<00:02:53.280> that<00:02:53.550> when<00:02:53.850> you're<00:02:54.060> in<00:02:54.090> 9th<00:02:54.390> grade

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
studies so that when you're in 9th grade

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.420 
studies so that when you're in 9th grade
English<00:02:54.810> you<00:02:55.230> start<00:02:55.530> off<00:02:55.680> by<00:02:55.710> learning<00:02:56.100> about

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
English you start off by learning about

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.900 
English you start off by learning about
Carol<00:02:56.940> Dweck's<00:02:57.180> work<00:02:57.330> on<00:02:57.750> mindset<00:02:58.170> and<00:02:58.910> the

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
Carol Dweck's work on mindset and the

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.000 
Carol Dweck's work on mindset and the
idea<00:03:00.270> of<00:03:00.360> being<00:03:00.630> that<00:03:00.840> is<00:03:01.020> intelligence<00:03:01.650> fixed

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
idea of being that is intelligence fixed

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.100 
idea of being that is intelligence fixed
or<00:03:02.130> is<00:03:02.220> intelligence<00:03:03.000> something<00:03:03.570> that<00:03:03.780> if<00:03:03.960> you

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
or is intelligence something that if you

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.700 
or is intelligence something that if you
practice<00:03:04.710> you<00:03:05.220> get<00:03:05.400> better<00:03:05.460> and<00:03:06.380> there<00:03:07.380> is<00:03:07.530> a

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
practice you get better and there is a

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.380 
practice you get better and there is a
lot<00:03:08.100> of<00:03:08.280> research<00:03:08.700> that<00:03:08.730> growth<00:03:09.360> mindset

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
lot of research that growth mindset

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.770 
lot of research that growth mindset
makes<00:03:10.230> a<00:03:10.380> tremendous<00:03:11.270> difference<00:03:12.270> in<00:03:12.510> terms

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
makes a tremendous difference in terms

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.100

difference<00:03:21.000> in<00:03:21.150> learning<00:03:21.450> outcomes<00:03:21.810> so<00:03:22.380> as

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
difference in learning outcomes so as

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.340 
difference in learning outcomes so as
ninth<00:03:23.070> graders<00:03:23.550> they<00:03:24.209> learn<00:03:24.900> about<00:03:25.140> these

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
ninth graders they learn about these

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.710 
ninth graders they learn about these
concepts<00:03:25.920> and<00:03:26.190> then<00:03:26.520> they<00:03:26.790> both<00:03:27.030> look<00:03:27.420> at<00:03:27.570> it

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
concepts and then they both look at it

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:28.970 
concepts and then they both look at it
through<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.110> characters<00:03:28.500> they're<00:03:28.709> reading

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
through the characters they're reading

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.770 
through the characters they're reading
about<00:03:29.220> so<00:03:29.580> they're<00:03:29.820> reading<00:03:30.030> The<00:03:30.239> Odyssey<00:03:30.390> and

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
about so they're reading The Odyssey and

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.720 
about so they're reading The Odyssey and
did<00:03:31.080> Odysseus<00:03:31.620> have<00:03:31.800> a<00:03:31.830> growth<00:03:32.100> mindset<00:03:32.130> or<00:03:32.700> a

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
did Odysseus have a growth mindset or a

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.790 
did Odysseus have a growth mindset or a
fixed<00:03:32.940> mindset<00:03:33.150> and<00:03:34.080> then<00:03:34.260> they're<00:03:34.440> thinking

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
fixed mindset and then they're thinking

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.180 
fixed mindset and then they're thinking
about<00:03:35.010> their<00:03:35.340> own<00:03:35.390> actual<00:03:36.560> work<00:03:37.560> throughout

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
about their own actual work throughout

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.610 
about their own actual work throughout
the<00:03:38.310> year
