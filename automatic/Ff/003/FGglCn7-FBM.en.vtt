00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
door on it its hooks inside and that's

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.160 
door on it its hooks inside and that's
going<00:01:19.070> to<00:01:19.220> be<00:01:19.340> useful<00:01:19.640> to<00:01:20.060> me<00:01:20.210> now<00:01:20.840> it's<00:01:21.020> my<00:01:21.140> job

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
going to be useful to me now it's my job

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.410 
going to be useful to me now it's my job
to<00:01:21.620> make<00:01:21.740> it<00:01:21.799> beautiful<00:01:22.070> but<00:01:22.940> it's<00:01:23.090> got<00:01:23.240> to<00:01:23.360> be

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
to make it beautiful but it's got to be

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.590 
to make it beautiful but it's got to be
useful<00:01:23.830> now<00:01:24.830> here's<00:01:25.010> the<00:01:25.130> problem

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.719 

say<00:01:28.230> you're<00:01:28.380> not<00:01:28.440> used<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.159> picking<00:01:29.640> out

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
say you're not used to picking out

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:30.560 
say you're not used to picking out
boards

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
boards

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.899 
boards
none<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.530> these<00:01:31.740> boards<00:01:32.220> are<00:01:32.340> wide<00:01:32.580> enough<00:01:32.760> to

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
none of these boards are wide enough to

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.410 
none of these boards are wide enough to
make<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.330> whole<00:01:33.510> cabinet<00:01:34.910> so<00:01:35.910> we're<00:01:36.090> looking

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
make the whole cabinet so we're looking

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
make the whole cabinet so we're looking
at<00:01:36.650> matching<00:01:37.650> our<00:01:37.800> boards<00:01:38.280> making<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.850> work

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
at matching our boards making it work

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.800 
at matching our boards making it work
well<00:01:40.440> here's<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.680> really<00:01:41.040> simple<00:01:41.250> trick<00:01:42.000> for

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
well here's a really simple trick for

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.330 
well here's a really simple trick for
small<00:01:43.080> cabinet<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:43.710> could<00:01:43.950> use<00:01:44.160> it<00:01:44.310> for

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
small cabinet so you could use it for

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.930 
small cabinet so you could use it for
something<00:01:44.820> larger<00:01:44.970> if<00:01:45.630> you're<00:01:46.260> not<00:01:46.470> used<00:01:46.770> to

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
something larger if you're not used to

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.210 
something larger if you're not used to
visualizing<00:01:47.940> how<00:01:48.720> pieces<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.650> wood<00:01:49.830> are<00:01:49.860> going

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
visualizing how pieces of wood are going

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.060 
visualizing how pieces of wood are going
to<00:01:50.340> look<00:01:50.460> at<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.729> finished<00:01:51.060> project<00:01:51.770> here's<00:01:52.770> one

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
to look at a finished project here's one

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.990 
to look at a finished project here's one
way<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.479> see<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.720> way<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:55.020> will<00:01:55.170> look<00:01:56.000> simply

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
way to see the way it will look simply

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.969 
way to see the way it will look simply
take<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.270> piece<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.780> cardboard<00:01:58.290> or<00:01:58.800> any

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979

material mark out the size of the
cabinet<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.399> want<00:02:03.530> cut<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.680> out<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.190> you<00:02:06.060> have

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
cabinet you want cut it out and you have

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:13.850 
cabinet you want cut it out and you have
a<00:02:06.270> frame<00:02:08.239> lay<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.479> fame<00:02:09.899> on<00:02:10.770> your<00:02:11.310> wood<00:02:12.860> now

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
a frame lay that fame on your wood now

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.990 
a frame lay that fame on your wood now
that<00:02:14.010> frame<00:02:15.050> puts<00:02:16.050> a<00:02:16.140> boundary<00:02:16.650> on<00:02:16.950> pieces<00:02:17.220> and

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
that frame puts a boundary on pieces and

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.650 
that frame puts a boundary on pieces and
you<00:02:18.360> can<00:02:18.390> move<00:02:18.720> it<00:02:18.900> around<00:02:18.959> now<00:02:19.910> here<00:02:20.910> now<00:02:21.600> you
