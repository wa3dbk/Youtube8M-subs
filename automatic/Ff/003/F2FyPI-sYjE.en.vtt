00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
in the fact that and I'm gonna be

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.869 
in the fact that and I'm gonna be
getting<00:00:54.649> some<00:00:54.800> revenue<00:00:55.159> from<00:00:55.309> it<00:00:55.519> that<00:00:55.550> I<00:00:55.730> can

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
getting some revenue from it that I can

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.090 
getting some revenue from it that I can
put<00:00:55.999> into<00:00:56.210> software<00:00:56.719> and<00:00:57.079> hardware<00:00:57.620> to

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
put into software and hardware to

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.939 
put into software and hardware to
improve<00:00:58.999> video<00:00:59.239> quality<00:00:59.449> but<00:00:59.929> the<00:01:00.649> fact<00:01:00.859> that

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
improve video quality but the fact that

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:03.309 
improve video quality but the fact that
it's<00:01:01.280> done<00:01:01.550> through<00:01:01.760> TGN<00:01:02.239> it<00:01:02.539> makes<00:01:02.839> it<00:01:03.050> so

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:03.319 
it's done through TGN it makes it so

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:05.200 
it's done through TGN it makes it so
that<00:01:03.350> I<00:01:03.469> can<00:01:03.620> just<00:01:03.859> continue<00:01:04.159> to<00:01:04.339> do<00:01:04.640> my<00:01:04.820> videos

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210

magical projectile and it's going to

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.910 
magical projectile and it's going to
tether<00:02:31.209> the<00:02:31.450> enemy<00:02:31.810> and<00:02:32.050> ending<00:02:32.380> other

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.630 
enemies within 10 yards to the landing
arrow<00:02:34.900> and<00:02:35.170> what<00:02:36.099> it's<00:02:36.220> going<00:02:36.250> to<00:02:36.370> do<00:02:36.519> is

arrow and what it's going to do is
increase<00:02:36.910> all<00:02:37.150> your<00:02:37.300> damage<00:02:37.750> that<00:02:38.140> you<00:02:38.440> do<00:02:38.860> to

them by fifteen percent and if they move

them by fifteen percent and if they move
15<00:02:42.130> yards<00:02:42.370> from<00:02:42.550> the<00:02:42.640> arrow<00:02:42.790> they're<00:02:43.090> stunned

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
15 yards from the arrow they're stunned

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.300 
15 yards from the arrow they're stunned
for<00:02:43.510> ten<00:02:43.660> seconds<00:02:44.019> that's<00:02:44.620> a<00:02:44.739> pretty<00:02:44.980> amazing

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
for ten seconds that's a pretty amazing

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.250 
for ten seconds that's a pretty amazing
PvP<00:02:45.940> ability<00:02:46.390> that's<00:02:46.600> going<00:02:46.810> to<00:02:46.870> require<00:02:46.989> some

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
PvP ability that's going to require some

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.800 
PvP ability that's going to require some
precision<00:02:48.100> to<00:02:48.310> use<00:02:48.519> but<00:02:48.760> if<00:02:48.880> you<00:02:49.000> can<00:02:49.180> master

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
precision to use but if you can master

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.720 
precision to use but if you can master
that<00:02:50.140> it's<00:02:50.380> going<00:02:50.500> to<00:02:50.590> give<00:02:50.709> hunters<00:02:50.890> a<00:02:51.100> nice

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
that it's going to give hunters a nice

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.509 
that it's going to give hunters a nice
edge<00:02:51.940> in<00:02:52.150> PvP<00:02:52.569> in<00:02:52.840> addition<00:02:53.410> to<00:02:53.650> obviously<00:02:54.130> the

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
edge in PvP in addition to obviously the

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.210 
edge in PvP in addition to obviously the
minimum<00:02:55.330> range<00:02:55.510> being<00:02:55.810> long<00:02:56.019> as<00:02:56.170> well<00:02:56.350> and<00:02:56.590> the

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
minimum range being long as well and the

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.680 
minimum range being long as well and the
other<00:02:57.370> ability<00:02:57.850> that<00:02:58.000> I've<00:02:58.120> talked<00:02:58.360> about<00:02:58.540> was

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
other ability that I've talked about was

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.259 
other ability that I've talked about was
powershot<00:02:59.230> and<00:02:59.500> it's<00:03:00.220> basically<00:03:00.640> like<00:03:00.910> a

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
powershot and it's basically like a

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.289 
powershot and it's basically like a
believe<00:03:02.049> is<00:03:02.140> going<00:03:02.230> to<00:03:02.349> be<00:03:02.440> used<00:03:02.590> in<00:03:02.680> a<00:03:02.739> pee<00:03:02.890> vee

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
believe is going to be used in a pee vee

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.059 
believe is going to be used in a pee vee
capacity<00:03:04.299> but<00:03:04.780> it's<00:03:04.930> basically<00:03:05.200> what<00:03:05.980> it's

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
capacity but it's basically what it's

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:07.770 
capacity but it's basically what it's
going<00:03:06.160> to<00:03:06.220> deal<00:03:06.400> damage<00:03:06.580> our<00:03:06.940> all<00:03:07.239> targets<00:03:07.690> in

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
going to deal damage our all targets in

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.550 
going to deal damage our all targets in
front<00:03:07.989> of<00:03:08.049> you<00:03:08.140> for<00:03:08.610> 20<00:03:09.610> yards<00:03:09.730> and<00:03:10.150> that's<00:03:10.560> why

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
front of you for 20 yards and that's why

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.920 
front of you for 20 yards and that's why
so<00:03:12.099> it's<00:03:12.220> like<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.519> width<00:03:12.760> and<00:03:12.910> the<00:03:13.000> damage

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
so it's like the width and the damage

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.690 
so it's like the width and the damage
done<00:03:14.110> is<00:03:14.440> increased<00:03:14.799> on<00:03:14.920> targets<00:03:15.370> further

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
done is increased on targets further

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.490 
done is increased on targets further
away<00:03:15.819> so<00:03:16.209> you're<00:03:16.660> going<00:03:16.780> to<00:03:16.840> do<00:03:17.019> double<00:03:17.349> damage

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
away so you're going to do double damage

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.819 
away so you're going to do double damage
in<00:03:17.980> between<00:03:18.310> 15<00:03:19.150> and<00:03:19.180> 30<00:03:19.390> yards<00:03:19.900> and<00:03:20.079> then<00:03:20.290> from

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
in between 15 and 30 yards and then from

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:22.620 
in between 15 and 30 yards and then from
30<00:03:21.250> to<00:03:21.400> 50<00:03:21.730> yards<00:03:21.940> you're<00:03:22.030> going<00:03:22.150> to<00:03:22.209> do<00:03:22.269> triple

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
30 to 50 yards you're going to do triple

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.479 
30 to 50 yards you're going to do triple
damage<00:03:22.930> and<00:03:23.109> also<00:03:23.709> start<00:03:24.010> with<00:03:24.100> them<00:03:24.220> as<00:03:24.370> well

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
damage and also start with them as well

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.849 
damage and also start with them as well
so<00:03:25.480> this<00:03:25.870> is<00:03:25.989> definitely<00:03:26.140> some<00:03:26.440> interesting

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
so this is definitely some interesting

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.009 
so this is definitely some interesting
abilities<00:03:27.280> that<00:03:27.519> they've<00:03:27.760> replaced<00:03:28.329> that<00:03:28.780> you

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
abilities that they've replaced that you

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:30.569 
abilities that they've replaced that you
know<00:03:29.140> arcane<00:03:29.680> arrows<00:03:30.010> invented<00:03:30.400> tipped

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
know arcane arrows invented tipped

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:31.890 
know arcane arrows invented tipped
arrows<00:03:30.700> with<00:03:31.000> because<00:03:31.209> it<00:03:31.299> was<00:03:31.420> really<00:03:31.690> boring

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
arrows with because it was really boring

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.590 
arrows with because it was really boring
and<00:03:32.230> there<00:03:33.069> was<00:03:33.160> nothing<00:03:33.280> new<00:03:33.579> to<00:03:33.730> it<00:03:33.910> and<00:03:34.030> then

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
and there was nothing new to it and then

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.720 
and there was nothing new to it and then
the<00:03:34.750> last<00:03:34.900> ability<00:03:35.380> is<00:03:35.560> clave<00:03:35.890> toss<00:03:36.160> and<00:03:36.549> it's

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
the last ability is clave toss and it's

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.910 
the last ability is clave toss and it's
another<00:03:36.940> PvP<00:03:37.450> ability<00:03:37.870> where<00:03:38.109> that<00:03:38.769> you're

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
another PvP ability where that you're

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.199 
another PvP ability where that you're
basically<00:03:39.190> just<00:03:39.340> going<00:03:39.519> to<00:03:39.579> shoot<00:03:39.760> claves<00:03:40.030> in

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
basically just going to shoot claves in

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:41.819 
basically just going to shoot claves in
front<00:03:40.420> of<00:03:40.480> you<00:03:40.569> kind<00:03:40.900> of<00:03:40.959> like<00:03:41.079> a<00:03:41.170> boomerang<00:03:41.380> I

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
front of you kind of like a boomerang I

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:43.800 
front of you kind of like a boomerang I
believe<00:03:42.100> and<00:03:42.310> it's<00:03:43.239> going<00:03:43.359> to<00:03:43.420> reduce<00:03:43.540> the

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
believe and it's going to reduce the

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.270 
believe and it's going to reduce the
movements<00:03:44.109> of<00:03:44.170> you<00:03:44.290> about<00:03:44.410> fifty<00:03:44.709> percent<00:03:44.739> and

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
movements of you about fifty percent and

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.830 
movements of you about fifty percent and
then<00:03:45.489> when<00:03:45.760> the<00:03:45.850> glaze<00:03:46.030> come<00:03:46.269> back<00:03:46.510> to<00:03:46.690> you

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
then when the glaze come back to you

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.960 
then when the glaze come back to you
they<00:03:47.290> deal<00:03:47.530> damage<00:03:47.769> and<00:03:48.160> snare<00:03:48.370> targets<00:03:48.850> if

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
they deal damage and snare targets if

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.120 
they deal damage and snare targets if
they<00:03:49.090> hit<00:03:49.209> them<00:03:49.420> and<00:03:50.319> then<00:03:50.530> if<00:03:50.650> you<00:03:50.799> hit

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
they hit them and then if you hit

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.479 
they hit them and then if you hit
targets<00:03:51.940> in<00:03:52.090> at<00:03:52.209> least<00:03:52.329> two<00:03:52.600> directions<00:03:53.489> there

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
targets in at least two directions there

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.250 
targets in at least two directions there
are<00:03:54.549> two<00:03:54.730> enemies<00:03:55.150> in<00:03:55.329> both<00:03:55.510> directions<00:03:55.690> the

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
are two enemies in both directions the

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.870 
are two enemies in both directions the
cooldown<00:03:56.530> is<00:03:56.560> going<00:03:56.739> to<00:03:56.799> reset<00:03:57.220> so<00:03:57.730> it's

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
cooldown is going to reset so it's

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.430 
cooldown is going to reset so it's
another<00:03:58.030> precision<00:03:58.600> ability<00:03:59.019> kind<00:03:59.230> of<00:03:59.319> late

another precision ability kind of late

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.259 
another precision ability kind of late
binding<00:03:59.620> shot<00:03:59.980> obviously<00:04:00.790> going<00:04:00.910> to<00:04:01.000> require

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
binding shot obviously going to require

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.750 
binding shot obviously going to require
a<00:04:01.329> lot<00:04:01.600> of<00:04:01.630> practice<00:04:02.170> but<00:04:02.440> another<00:04:03.400> tool<00:04:03.730> that

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
a lot of practice but another tool that

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.729 
a lot of practice but another tool that
the<00:04:04.060> hunters<00:04:04.329> get<00:04:04.480> in<00:04:04.630> the<00:04:04.750> PPP<00:04:05.170> arsenal<00:04:05.620> and

the hunters get in the PPP arsenal and

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:07.620 
the hunters get in the PPP arsenal and

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.390 
the last thing that I didn't want to
discuss<00:04:07.959> is<00:04:08.230> camouflage<00:04:08.920> is<00:04:09.100> going<00:04:09.250> to<00:04:09.310> be

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
discuss is camouflage is going to be

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.980

it's basically going to give us another

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.880 
it's basically going to give us another
feign<00:04:14.910> death<00:04:15.120> if<00:04:15.510> that's<00:04:15.990> the<00:04:16.110> way<00:04:16.200> that<00:04:16.320> they
