reserve league that no longer exists
they'll<00:01:10.530> have<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.920> find<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.400> games<00:01:11.640> there

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
they'll have to find that games there

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.219 
they'll have to find that games there
then<00:01:12.360> for<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.600> rest<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.930> teams<00:01:13.110> that

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
then for the rest of the teams that

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.020 
then for the rest of the teams that
don't<00:01:13.320> have<00:01:13.530> affiliations<00:01:13.950> we've<00:01:14.549> got<00:01:14.700> two

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
don't have affiliations we've got two

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.210 
don't have affiliations we've got two
extra<00:01:15.509> games<00:01:15.750> now<00:01:15.990> it's<00:01:16.229> not<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.439> whole<00:01:16.740> lot<00:01:17.009> to

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
extra games now it's not a whole lot to

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.980 
extra games now it's not a whole lot to
start<00:01:17.549> but<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.090> hope<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.479> down<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.960> line

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
start but the hope is down the line

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.990 
start but the hope is down the line
perhaps<00:01:19.409> our<00:01:19.740> reserve<00:01:20.070> league<00:01:20.280> teams<00:01:20.520> will<00:01:20.939> be

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
perhaps our reserve league teams will be

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.429 
perhaps our reserve league teams will be
playing<00:01:21.240> even<00:01:21.570> more<00:01:21.750> competitive<00:01:22.080> matches

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
playing even more competitive matches

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.740 
playing even more competitive matches
against<00:01:23.220> teams<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.850> maybe<00:01:24.240> are<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.570> little

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
against teams that maybe are a little

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.870 
against teams that maybe are a little
bit<00:01:24.960> more<00:01:24.990> motivated<00:01:25.799> maybe<00:01:26.009> have<00:01:26.310> full

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
bit more motivated maybe have full

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.210 
bit more motivated maybe have full
rosters<00:01:27.420> are<00:01:27.600> more<00:01:28.080> more<00:01:28.439> secure<00:01:28.920> in<00:01:29.100> their

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
rosters are more more secure in their

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.649 
rosters are more more secure in their
lineups<00:01:29.579> week<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.790> week<00:01:29.909> well<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.329> think<00:01:30.390> for

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
lineups week to week well I think for

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.749 
lineups week to week well I think for
USL<00:01:31.140> PRO<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.710> benefits<00:01:32.159> are<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.729> have

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
USL PRO the benefits are that you have

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.910 
USL PRO the benefits are that you have
this<00:01:33.090> affiliation<00:01:33.570> with<00:01:33.990> MLS<00:01:34.650> that's

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
this affiliation with MLS that's

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.440 
this affiliation with MLS that's
certainly<00:01:35.310> something<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.790> will<00:01:35.909> impress

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
certainly something that will impress

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.969 
certainly something that will impress
the<00:01:36.479> fans<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.140> maybe<00:01:37.259> get<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.560> little<00:01:37.770> bit<00:01:37.860> more

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
the fans and maybe get a little bit more

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.590 
the fans and maybe get a little bit more
that<00:01:38.159> way<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.490> think<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.880> start<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.299> build<00:01:39.450> a

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
that way I think you start to build a

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.240 
that way I think you start to build a
little<00:01:39.780> bit<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.020> more<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.500> market<00:01:41.070> so

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
little bit of a more of a market so

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.649 
little bit of a more of a market so
eventually<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:41.939> could<00:01:42.119> have<00:01:42.240> some<00:01:42.420> players

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
eventually you could have some players

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.289 
eventually you could have some players
from<00:01:42.810> USL<00:01:43.229> PRO<00:01:43.409> being<00:01:43.680> sold<00:01:44.009> into<00:01:44.490> an<00:01:44.579> MLS<00:01:44.939> club

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
from USL PRO being sold into an MLS club

club is you're getting players who are
thrown<00:01:57.960> in<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.259> maybe<00:01:58.439> they<00:01:58.649> don't<00:01:58.740> fit<00:01:59.280> your

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
thrown in and maybe they don't fit your

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.910 
thrown in and maybe they don't fit your
mix<00:01:59.820> maybe<00:02:00.119> you<00:02:00.329> have<00:02:00.479> built<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.899> system<00:02:01.110> that

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
mix maybe you have built a system that

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.830 
mix maybe you have built a system that
you<00:02:02.070> play<00:02:02.280> one<00:02:02.520> way<00:02:02.670> Sporting<00:02:03.509> Kansas<00:02:03.600> City

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
you play one way Sporting Kansas City

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.690 
you play one way Sporting Kansas City
for<00:02:04.140> example<00:02:04.200> sends<00:02:04.829> a<00:02:04.890> player<00:02:05.070> down<00:02:05.340> they're

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
for example sends a player down they're

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.639 
for example sends a player down they're
used<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.119> playing<00:02:06.360> maybe<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.719> 4-3-3<00:02:07.229> you're

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
used to playing maybe a 4-3-3 you're

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.199 
used to playing maybe a 4-3-3 you're
playing<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:07.950> 4-4-2<00:02:08.399> or<00:02:08.759> something<00:02:09.030> like<00:02:09.119> that

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
playing a 4-4-2 or something like that

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.479 
playing a 4-4-2 or something like that
does<00:02:09.869> it<00:02:10.020> start<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.379> throw<00:02:10.619> that<00:02:10.830> mix<00:02:11.099> off<00:02:11.310> so

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
does it start to throw that mix off so

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.809 
does it start to throw that mix off so
that's<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.819> big<00:02:11.970> challenge<00:02:12.180> I<00:02:12.420> think

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
that's a big challenge I think

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.970 
that's a big challenge I think
USL<00:02:13.510> PRO<00:02:13.719> but<00:02:13.989> ultimately<00:02:14.439> I<00:02:14.530> think<00:02:14.739> there<00:02:14.860> are

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
USL PRO but ultimately I think there are

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.500 
USL PRO but ultimately I think there are
lots<00:02:15.099> more<00:02:15.280> benefits<00:02:15.819> here<00:02:16.060> than<00:02:16.239> anything

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
lots more benefits here than anything

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.509 
lots more benefits here than anything
for<00:02:17.230> both<00:02:17.500> sides<00:02:17.829> because<00:02:18.159> I<00:02:18.250> think<00:02:18.310> the

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
for both sides because I think the

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.069 
for both sides because I think the
reserve<00:02:18.790> players<00:02:19.090> would<00:02:19.329> get<00:02:19.420> better<00:02:19.629> action

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:20.079 
reserve players would get better action

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:22.380 
reserve players would get better action
that<00:02:20.260> way<00:02:20.439> and<00:02:20.739> of<00:02:21.219> course<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.579> USL<00:02:21.969> PRO<00:02:22.209> will

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
that way and of course the USL PRO will

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.880 
that way and of course the USL PRO will
get<00:02:22.510> some<00:02:22.659> players<00:02:22.900> and<00:02:23.170> that<00:02:23.530> connection

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
get some players and that connection

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.970 
get some players and that connection
with<00:02:24.189> MLS<00:02:24.959> if<00:02:25.959> you<00:02:26.109> have<00:02:26.319> not<00:02:26.560> been<00:02:26.769> paying

Joseph's<00:03:57.459> I<00:03:57.669> don't<00:03:58.060> know<00:03:58.150> any<00:03:58.299> truth<00:03:58.689> whether

there's any truth or anything like this
but<00:04:00.909> I<00:04:00.939> think<00:04:01.060> I<00:04:01.419> would<00:04:01.750> suggest<00:04:01.989> that<00:04:02.439> LA<00:04:02.919> he's

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
but I think I would suggest that LA he's

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.830 
but I think I would suggest that LA he's
exactly<00:04:03.909> the<00:04:04.030> kind<00:04:04.299> of<00:04:04.359> player<00:04:04.540> that<00:04:04.780> the

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
exactly the kind of player that the

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.599 
exactly the kind of player that the
galaxy<00:04:05.290> would<00:04:05.349> go<00:04:05.470> after<00:04:05.590> a<00:04:05.919> little<00:04:06.189> bit<00:04:06.280> older

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
galaxy would go after a little bit older

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:08.219 
galaxy would go after a little bit older
brings<00:04:07.180> something<00:04:07.479> in<00:04:07.689> the<00:04:07.780> midfield<00:04:07.930> that

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:08.229 
brings something in the midfield that

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:10.170 
brings something in the midfield that
they<00:04:08.319> could<00:04:08.530> use<00:04:08.769> you<00:04:09.459> know<00:04:09.549> they<00:04:09.819> have<00:04:09.970> junior

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
they could use you know they have junior

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.849 
they could use you know they have junior
but<00:04:10.629> they<00:04:10.689> could<00:04:10.840> also<00:04:10.959> always<00:04:11.530> use<00:04:11.709> an

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:11.859 
but they could also always use an

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:14.280 
but they could also always use an
experienced<00:04:12.370> midfielder<00:04:12.729> like<00:04:12.879> that<00:04:13.030> so<00:04:13.329> he

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
experienced midfielder like that so he

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.270
