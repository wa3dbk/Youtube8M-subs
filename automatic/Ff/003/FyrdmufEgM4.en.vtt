 Fourthly I would like to answer 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.959
 a very recurrent question on the channel 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.500
 which is because with so much delay to be 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.090
 done 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.780
 currently each episode of the poet and 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.300
 takes between 200 and 250 hours 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.430
 This is a long time so even though your 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.480

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.090

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.130
 I will not finish mine, you know how to make a 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.200
 second of animation needs 24 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.380
 this is the nature of the content 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.959
 animated or to make a second 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.850
 to do a blog second needs 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.860
 a real-life second to make a 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.080

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.780

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.250
 do two seconds a week or 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.330
 This is the time you really needed to 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.330
 make two seconds 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.709

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.370
 so much in so little because it is very 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.109
 some even just look how much my serve not 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.310
 it's not clear that I did not start with 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:07.630
 these equipments I started as the 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.769
 computer that he no longer 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:14.680
 it works more and mouse anyway everything already half 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:16.510
 messed up there but at last and then after I was 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.910
 evolving and changing equipment and 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.200
 everything else is that they are my books 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.640
 that I have since I started to 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.060
 study animation 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.550
 so whoever wants 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.250

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.380
