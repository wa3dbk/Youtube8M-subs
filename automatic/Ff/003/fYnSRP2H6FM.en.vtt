00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:09.160
 [Music] 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.160
 let's see how to make this semirecogido 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:16.670
 we start by choosing where we are going to do 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:19.130
 the line in this case the girl in the photo 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.060
 take it aside but you can well 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.060
 do it with line in between 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:28.110
 and we are going to go taking sections to go 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.490
 working the waves 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:35.630
 [Music] 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:39.170
 let's unfold in clay 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:42.700
 directing the waves in the direction in the 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.700
 that we want to go to the hair 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.640
 you can do them with plates if you want 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.450
 something natural you can leave your 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.450
 natural hair 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:09.429
 [Music] 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.020
 you can also work the dryer before 

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:13.799
 of hands and that of being volume in 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.799
 some area 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.499
 [Music] 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.990
 In this case, I will not only teach you the 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.360
 hairstyle of the image 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.380
 let's see three options 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.030
 [Music] 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.490
 then it will depend on the girl in the photo 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.390
 It has bangs in my case the mannequin does not 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.390
 has bangs 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.220
 we should ruffle a bit if we do not want 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.220
 that the curls are so marked 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.549
 [Music] 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.280
 and let's start with the first option 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.620
 we already have the line next to us that we want 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.750
 so we take a small section and 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.450
 let's start a braid of three 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.180
 capes 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.220
 now our cane a section like that 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.310
 that we take a small section in the 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.540
 zone of the line and we passed and now we're going 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.510
 to take from the side 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:27.019
 let's leave the hair all the time 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:30.580
 we're just going to catch a small one 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:33.900
 lock on the sides 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.670
 [Music] 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.849
 we must welcome our small section 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.680
 that we joined it and we pass now 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.140
 let's go down towards the side 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.580
 we take another small section that 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.650
 we unite and we had it 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.650
 you choose where you want 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.410
 I will give you the braid in this 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.430
 case an action and in the third you go to 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.510
 see another action 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.800
 Y 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:03.590
 [Music] 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:06.370
 and tighten the braid or even leave it 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.370
 more loose 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:21.000
 [Music] 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.870
 and we are going to finish the braid until the 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.870
 height that we want 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.060
 so in this case it's going to be simple 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.970
 we are simply going to hide the braid 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.250
 below the hair 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.070
 this way we will not have all the 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:39.550
 mane to one side we can divide the 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:41.030
 hair towards the two shoulders 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.830
 [Music] 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:48.480
 we would be this side more retired 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.480
 and the other loose hair 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:04:01.890
 [Music] 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:05.680
 let's see the second action 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:07.390
 keeping the braid we've done what 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.330
 what we are going to do is remove a little more 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:12.310
 the hair so let's take part 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.410
 on the left side and let's go 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.209
 hiding it on the right side 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:25.060
 under the hair 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:26.710
 [Music] 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.770
 we take from the nape of the left side 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.570
 another strand and we 're going to 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:35.840
 to hook 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:39.260
 [Music] 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.030
 and then the braid although depending if 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.650
 you want it to look more or less the braid 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.650
 you can hook it first 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:55.360
 [Music] 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:59.670
 and this would be another action to take 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:12.569
 all the hair towards the right shoulder 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:15.910
 [Music] 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:18.970
 and for the third option 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:22.020
 what we are going to do first is to hold 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:25.210
 the hair that is on the left side 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:28.950
 let's undo the braid and let's 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.950
 lengthen the little bit more 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.170
 let's start from where we have 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.540
 left so now we have to pass a 

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:39.340
 tuft on the left side so 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.070
 we take another small section of the 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:44.950
 we unite in this case we're just going to join in 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:47.320
 this side though if you want to give it a 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:50.640
 different touch you can keep joining 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.640
 from the other side too 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.770
 in this case following the braid what 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:58.310
 let's do is bring more hair 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:04.580
 towards the right shoulder 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:08.500
 [Music] 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.500
 the braid to where you want to do more 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.120
 in this case what I will be holding 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.010
 a little hair in that direction 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.620
 although I could simply choose the 

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:24.270
 braid and hide it by the hair as 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:33.920
 we have done in the first option 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:36.650
 [Music] 

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:39.900
 we go like rolling hair and one 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:43.280
 of the nipples is the one that we hold 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:46.980
 [Music] 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:55.780
 and now we are going to place the defense 

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:58.690
 [Music] 

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:01.770
 and this would be our third most action 

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:01.770
 removed from the left side 

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:08.810
 well you know I'm on facebook 

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.810
 and on twitter in English taipei cat 

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:14.330
 [Music] 

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:16.670
 and just tell you that if you want 

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.890
 keep watching semi - hidden videos 

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:20.550
 you just have to click on the right in 

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:22.880
 The top 

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:27.310
 [Music] 

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:27.310
 and here I say goodbye until next time
