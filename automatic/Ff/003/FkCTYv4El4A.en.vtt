00:00:02.529 --> 00:00:06.859
 just before midnight in the 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.559
 transit from Margetshöchheim 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:13.910
 So far , Peter Bohn Inge is satisfied 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:18.400
 with the transport of his ship after all 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.400
 Now it's getting really tight 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.380
 Of course we measured everything 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.550
 and, of course, concerned about that 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.550
 a nice lamp 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.719
 but said something about this 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.730
 despite the late hour, some are 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:40.129
 Residents have come from their homes 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.949
 they do not want that spectacle 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.690
 miss 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:47.180
 mayor waldemar brohm is also mayor 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.629
 on the spot to see if everything is smooth 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.850
 running 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.710
 we do everything from our side 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.300
 what were necessary for the post 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.100
 mined in the signs mined comes 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.360
 Not every day was the first one 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.379
 send pictures 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.000
 still the bottleneck is not mastered 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.430
 scrape the boat or damage the boat 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.550
 houses while fatal now just great 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.530
 again a piece made 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:12.229
 but more critical points should 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.060
 one and a half hours is still coming 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.720
 Sword transport meanwhile on the way 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:20.630
 a good kilometer to the finish 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.970
 the last intersection review meeting the 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.460
 situation suddenly turns out differently 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.140
 as planned 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.570
 yes we are there as soon as we have 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.880
 so the trans partie is calculated only 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.149
 the traffic lights follow rotated a rest 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.190
 as a result we will have now 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:38.989
 of course, the problem that you too 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.590
 stay can vary depending on the traffic light 

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:44.390
 but the driver thinks it works that way too 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.390
 Again, it's about millimeters 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.759
 the 18 meters long and seven meters high 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.330
 The yacht has to pass by the traffic light 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.970
 become 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.880
 a hairy maneuver but that too 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.190
 masters the driver without problems then 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.810
 only a few branches growing away 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.399
 remove and the way to the goal is free 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.160
 almost only have one more critical 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:10.100
 The entrance is wonder to mine 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:13.200
 right on the good course 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.830
 as expected will be here again 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.830
 really tight 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:25.590
 a bit ground contact but everything 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.430
 no problem the work is done that 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.620
 go on 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.080
 there were already there I think 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.550
 9 o'clock is the ship in the water and 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.710
 then let's have a look 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:41.690
 Well and then swim around 750,000 euros 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.690
 at würzburg in the main
