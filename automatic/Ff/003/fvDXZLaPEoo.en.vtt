00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hey everyone i want it in this 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.690
 movie talk about giving 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.519
 water to tomatoes and every where true 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.170
 raking to an arm comes straight or 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.540
 say i got spontaneous 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.030
 abdominal cramps if I sometimes have something there 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.770
 All written about 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.109
 I got all the doubts from me and me 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.750
 show you how i have been doing this for years 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.880
 success goal and that's really every day now 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.890
 borculo 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.990
 I have drawn up some sort of rules for 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.849
 myself and has entered the people 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.640
 start when I gave tomato plant 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.250
 the first week and a half to a maximum 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.730
 two weeks of water every day that is too 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.290
 logical 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.540
 those customers must be able to adapt 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.640
 to a new growing environment and me 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.379
 therefore only plant in a cupboard 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.820
 it is often warming up here too 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.550
 That means that there is more moisture 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.610
 evaporated and they therefore need more water 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.010
 because after two weeks I will return 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.719
 I screw it back there 2 or 3 times 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.430
 week that depends on the weather and 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.520
 so keep an eye on something 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.160
 two to three times a week maximum 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.400
 then I continue to reduce to one and a half 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.260
 about a month and then I sit once 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.659
 provide weekly water 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.180
 the advantage of not watering often 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.820
 is just that goes in search of ourselves 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.299
 you do the lower soil layers to water 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.610
 not that 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.840
 and you water every day that you manage 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.700
 so-called 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.380
 Lazy roots explain it for it 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.810
 himself maybe a bit 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.610
 so we are roots that are superficial 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.680
 are going to be carrots from the moisture 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.350
 faster out of the head and therefore the plants 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.439
 depend more on us 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.530
 no actually an ultimate tip 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.600
 classic the pet bottle super simple 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.729
 you actually put some kind of water 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.900
 reservoir with the plan 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.900
 it's super easy to do 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.619
 you keep the bottom of a bottle 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.320
 mariska 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.470
 I get you something to those close to 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.270
 the plant three were in the ground that you 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.149
 four later in the customer decides himself 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.310
 when she absorbs moisture 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.440
 you had even more info to subscribe 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.110

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.160
