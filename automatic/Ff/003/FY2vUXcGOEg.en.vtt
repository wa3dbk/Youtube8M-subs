this<00:00:30.150> cool<00:00:30.390> set<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:31.640> course<00:00:32.640> gets<00:00:32.880> even<00:00:33.059> more

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
this cool set of course gets even more

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.479 
this cool set of course gets even more
interesting<00:00:33.390> also<00:00:34.380> I've<00:00:34.739> shown<00:00:34.950> you<00:00:34.980> up<00:00:35.100> until

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
interesting also I've shown you up until

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.490 
interesting also I've shown you up until
now<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:36.030> all<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.600> network<00:00:36.870> data<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.320> the

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
now is all of the network data of the

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.889 
now is all of the network data of the
host<00:00:37.829> box<00:00:38.160> in<00:00:38.489> one<00:00:38.969> thing<00:00:39.239> bucket<00:00:39.600> like<00:00:39.780> the

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
host box in one thing bucket like the

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.959 
host box in one thing bucket like the
graph<00:00:40.140> showing<00:00:40.500> all<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:41.160> reviews<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.700> those

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
graph showing all that reviews of those

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.639 
graph showing all that reviews of those
to<00:00:42.149> all<00:00:42.300> clients<00:00:42.570> that's<00:00:43.200> not<00:00:43.350> really<00:00:43.559> the

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
to all clients that's not really the

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.170 
to all clients that's not really the
most<00:00:43.800> interesting<00:00:44.280> thing<00:00:44.550> but<00:00:44.730> interesting

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
most interesting thing but interesting

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.880 
most interesting thing but interesting
thing<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.450> this<00:00:45.719> which<00:00:46.350> looks<00:00:46.379> sort<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.800> the

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
thing is this which looks sort of the

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.819 
thing is this which looks sort of the
same<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.280> but<00:00:47.489> not<00:00:47.640> take<00:00:47.820> my<00:00:47.910> word<00:00:47.940> for<00:00:48.090> it

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
same to you but not take my word for it

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.639 
same to you but not take my word for it
this<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:49.890> showing<00:00:50.250> bandwidth<00:00:51.000> as<00:00:51.180> sent<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.350> the

this is showing bandwidth as sent to the
particular<00:00:53.010> client<00:00:53.789> della<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.090> sword<00:00:54.449> only

particular client della the sword only

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.439 
particular client della the sword only
this<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.070> contents<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.850> packets<00:00:57.300> that

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
this is the contents of the packets that

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.299 
this is the contents of the packets that
we<00:00:57.600> were<00:00:57.719> set<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:58.079> sent<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.410> him<00:00:58.680> in<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.100> game

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
we were set to sent to him in this game

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.209 
we were set to sent to him in this game
at<00:00:59.520> this<00:00:59.640> time<00:01:00.289> we<00:01:01.289> can<00:01:01.440> also<00:01:01.590> go<00:01:01.829> in<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.010> look

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
at this time we can also go in and look

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.979 
at this time we can also go in and look
at<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.370> particular<00:01:02.489> object<00:01:02.969> like<00:01:03.329> this<00:01:03.449> shotgun

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
at a particular object like this shotgun

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.190 
at a particular object like this shotgun
and<00:01:04.670> has<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.700> button<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.299> filter<00:01:06.689> all<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:07.080> our

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
and has a button and filter all of our

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.810 
and has a button and filter all of our
data<00:01:07.409> being<00:01:07.740> sent<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.220> one<00:01:08.460> will<00:01:08.670> eat

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
data being sent to that one will eat

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.640 
data being sent to that one will eat
with<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:09.210> whenever<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.600> sword<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:10.470> show

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
with that whenever the sword to show

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.440 
with that whenever the sword to show
only<00:01:10.890> get<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.159> sense<00:01:11.460> about<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.880> shotgun

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
only get a sense about that shotgun

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.660 
only get a sense about that shotgun
similarly<00:01:12.990> in<00:01:13.110> this<00:01:13.200> pipe<00:01:13.500> we<00:01:14.430> can<00:01:14.490> say<00:01:14.640> oh

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
similarly in this pipe we can say oh

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.460 
similarly in this pipe we can say oh
this<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.090> all<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.479> stuff<00:01:15.659> we<00:01:15.780> transmit<00:01:16.229> about

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
this is all the stuff we transmit about

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.789 
this is all the stuff we transmit about
that<00:01:16.619> like<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:16.950> this<00:01:17.100> is

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799 
that like that this is

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:20.350 
that like that this is
rotation<00:01:18.799> system<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:19.549> movement<00:01:19.969> of<00:01:20.030> that<00:01:20.149> guy

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
rotation system the movement of that guy

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.490 
rotation system the movement of that guy
recently<00:01:21.039> as<00:01:22.039> we<00:01:22.280> have<00:01:22.399> to<00:01:22.520> care<00:01:22.850> about<00:01:22.909> but

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
recently as we have to care about but

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.840 
recently as we have to care about but
these<00:01:24.500> are<00:01:24.619> still<00:01:24.710> one<00:01:25.009> second<00:01:25.369> average<00:01:25.729> is

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
these are still one second average is

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.429 
these are still one second average is
about<00:01:26.060> we<00:01:26.390> didn't<00:01:26.780> weigh<00:01:26.840> more<00:01:27.049> you<00:01:27.170> tell<00:01:27.320> them

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
about we didn't weigh more you tell them

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:29.319 
about we didn't weigh more you tell them
that<00:01:27.470> we<00:01:27.680> have<00:01:27.770> all<00:01:28.070> the<00:01:28.189> data<00:01:28.369> we<00:01:28.729> can<00:01:29.060> show

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
that we have all the data we can show

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:32.080 
that we have all the data we can show
every<00:01:29.899> single<00:01:30.439> packet<00:01:30.979> that<00:01:31.100> we<00:01:31.280> send<00:01:31.700> to<00:01:31.820> this

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
every single packet that we send to this

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.690 
every single packet that we send to this
client<00:01:32.420> and<00:01:33.170> look<00:01:33.530> inside<00:01:34.009> them<00:01:34.310> in<00:01:34.429> this<00:01:34.520> very

client and look inside them in this very
visual<00:01:35.149> way<00:01:35.360> to<00:01:35.979> see<00:01:40.060> what<00:01:41.060> property<00:01:41.450> name<00:01:42.130> we

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
visual way to see what property name we

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:53.520 
visual way to see what property name we
can<00:01:43.280> scroll<00:01:43.490> through<00:01:43.549> time<00:01:43.970> and<00:01:44.270> scrub<00:01:44.509> back

this<00:01:54.530> whole<00:01:54.800> picture<00:01:55.990> is<00:01:56.990> what<00:01:57.140> allowed<00:01:57.380> us<00:01:57.560> to

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
this whole picture is what allowed us to

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.390 
this whole picture is what allowed us to
reduce<00:01:58.010> the<00:01:58.790> overall<00:01:59.090> method<00:01:59.600> of<00:02:00.140> Halo<00:02:00.560> 3<00:02:00.830> our
