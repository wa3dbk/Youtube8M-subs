00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
so destructive and spending time at the

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.140 
so destructive and spending time at the
crease<00:01:06.650> it's<00:01:07.650> only<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.040> matter<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.340> time<00:01:08.430> in<00:01:08.909> my

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
crease it's only a matter of time in my

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.039 
crease it's only a matter of time in my
opinion<00:01:09.320> that<00:01:10.320> you'll<00:01:10.500> come<00:01:10.770> good<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:12.049> we

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
opinion that you'll come good and we

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.359 
opinion that you'll come good and we
have<00:01:13.140> seen<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.470> with<00:01:13.619> Chris<00:01:13.799> Gayle<00:01:14.010> our

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
have seen it with Chris Gayle our

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.620 
have seen it with Chris Gayle our
perfect<00:01:15.119> example<00:01:15.659> we<00:01:16.409> can<00:01:16.950> see<00:01:17.130> him<00:01:17.420> go<00:01:18.420> from

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
perfect example we can see him go from

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.350 
perfect example we can see him go from
ball<00:01:18.869> one<00:01:18.900> ways<00:01:19.500> as<00:01:20.130> destructive<00:01:20.729> as<00:01:20.939> anything

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
ball one ways as destructive as anything

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.899 
ball one ways as destructive as anything
can<00:01:21.479> be<00:01:21.689> then<00:01:22.409> there<00:01:22.619> are<00:01:22.680> times<00:01:22.950> where<00:01:23.189> he<00:01:23.340> he

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
can be then there are times where he he

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.050 
can be then there are times where he he
think<00:01:24.270> himself<00:01:24.420> through<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.560> whole<00:01:25.770> process

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
think himself through that whole process

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.660 
think himself through that whole process
so<00:01:27.350> that's<00:01:28.350> what<00:01:28.530> we<00:01:28.680> were<00:01:28.799> talking<00:01:29.009> about<00:01:29.220> and

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
so that's what we were talking about and

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.850 
so that's what we were talking about and
I<00:01:29.909> think<00:01:30.630> Chris<00:01:30.780> would<00:01:31.020> have<00:01:31.140> played<00:01:31.829> the

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
I think Chris would have played the

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.960 
I think Chris would have played the
bluff<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.280> few<00:01:32.460> times<00:01:32.700> by<00:01:33.979> being<00:01:34.979> at<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.610> crease

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
bluff a few times by being at the crease

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.420 
bluff a few times by being at the crease
fur<00:01:36.240> for<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.570> period<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:36.960> time<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.560> why<00:01:38.369> is

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
fur for a period of time and why is

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.300 
fur for a period of time and why is
there<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:39.090> guess<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.140> fields<00:01:40.530> men<00:01:40.680> in<00:01:40.890> my

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
there I guess the fields men in my

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.100 
there I guess the fields men in my
opinion<00:01:41.820> they're<00:01:42.420> going<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.630> be<00:01:42.689> sweating<00:01:42.930> a

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
opinion they're going to be sweating a

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.569 
opinion they're going to be sweating a
little<00:01:43.320> bit<00:01:43.439> more<00:01:43.649> often<00:01:43.799> than<00:01:44.040> not<00:01:44.189> because

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
little bit more often than not because

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.710 
little bit more often than not because
they<00:01:45.509> were<00:01:45.570> thinking<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.110> themselves<00:01:46.460> when<00:01:47.720> is

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
they were thinking to themselves when is

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.840 
they were thinking to themselves when is
maybe<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.799> put<00:01:50.009> c-walk<00:01:50.369> in<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.640> same

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
maybe you put c-walk in that same

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.630 
maybe you put c-walk in that same
category<00:01:51.079> when<00:01:52.079> are<00:01:52.200> these<00:01:52.350> guys<00:01:52.560> are<00:01:52.950> going

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
category when are these guys are going

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.880 
category when are these guys are going
to<00:01:53.700> go<00:01:54.110> because<00:01:55.110> they<00:01:55.259> can<00:01:55.409> pick<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:55.649> up<00:01:55.770> at

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
to go because they can pick it up at

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.639 
to go because they can pick it up at
some<00:01:56.040> point<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.610> I've<00:01:57.270> always<00:01:57.509> um<00:01:57.930> made<00:01:58.619> a
