00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:11.260
 last week the fc can go into action three times 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.630
 against FC Utrecht vitesse and I come 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.710
 fc groningen 2 is playing this week 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.390

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.980

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.990
 Sunday in euroborg against az 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.550
 how does fc groningen deal with multiple 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.439
 competitions in the week 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.119

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.630
 the two won 1 equal but especially the 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.390
 standing in the field, I found very 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.420
 positive certainly the last game after 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.949
 the way against vitesse much for he anyway 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.600
 I think that is a very tough competition 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:39.399
 we encounter a lot of energy 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.079

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:42.219
