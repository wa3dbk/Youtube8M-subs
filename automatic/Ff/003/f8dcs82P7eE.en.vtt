00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:16.600
 hello everyone, artes project again 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:20.650
 white dot com and today I want you 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:24.539
 tell about loki 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:27.650
 warlock speck hybrid 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.279
 so interesting of course 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.279
 speck 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:37.700
 who was famous at the time of 335 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.890
 the prophet was somehow forgotten at all 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.989
 was ineffective at pirates here 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.740
 I recently decided to test it and I 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:48.250
 it turned out that 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:50.050
 pretty good again became a hybrid work 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:54.280
 despite the fact that I have not collected yet 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:56.980
 Shmat we still a little bit 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.670
 further a good piece more precisely it is a good one 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.949
 DPS and in general 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.500
 compared to the earlier it became better 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.350
 work symbols we use a scheme 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.399
 igniting the symbol of fast decomposition and 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.590
 the symbol of incineration 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:16.009
 speed 1250 1300 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.409
 so the initial rotation we use 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.690
 we keep his sacrificial fire constant 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.970
 goals 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.720
 that is, we will constantly leave it 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.740
 use pkd 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:32.399
 further we use 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.740
 plague which is desirable and throw once 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:37.350
 once again when we have all 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.439
 tried that is, we monitor traffic jams and 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.520
 our talent pickets and all such 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.120
 because 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.660
 we put a symbol 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.110
 and so now the frequency of the cycles 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.320
 our 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.020
 from our speeds are scanned 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.460
 our 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:00.970
 archer why more accurate or damage 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:04.510
 further cast and curse rock 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.970
 that is, can you curse throw something 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.350
 have we look in the raid 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.830
 if a 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.610
 He's holik t. cylinders ie it 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.050
 druids 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:19.180
 in the owl seed balance and still watching 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.440
 so is there a raid 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.360
 other boats 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:27.220
 if there is no a d to and cylinders Tos 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.210
 agree with the bow that will be 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.220
 throw 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.670
 principle if you are the only log you 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:38.810
 will throw a curse verses if you 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:41.030
 forehead is not one here as in this reddit I 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:45.830
 throwing a curse of rock igniting throw 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.660
 it is updated constantly ppd new angle 35 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.950
 percent efficiency 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.190
 the boss and the rotation changes completely 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.910
 use 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.850
 soul burn 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.850
 constantly and quietly update sometimes 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.590
 curse update 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.350
 once its principle only update 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.650
 it will be necessary if you have slept and 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.660
 and constantly pagodas are updating damage this 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.630
 the only ones 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.420
 that we can only one advantageous 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.510
 update the rest i would say that 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.870
 better not update unprofitable is a loss 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:28.720
 time and such a huge DPS it to me 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.980
 will damage you quickly find 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.599
 don't spend too much time 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.290
 so 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:37.530
 yes rotation is pretty 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.990
 easy you to center yourself 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.530
 but we started only hard to keep track of 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.260
 all prog 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:49.750
 Well, thank you all with you was arthes waiting 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:53.010
 these guides are already on the can and 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.010
 thanks to all
