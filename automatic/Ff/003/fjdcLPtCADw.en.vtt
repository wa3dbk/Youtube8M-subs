to like whatever five or six know

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.850 
to like whatever five or six know
whatever<00:02:40.030> it<00:02:40.090> was<00:02:40.240> but<00:02:41.200> yeah<00:02:41.290> it<00:02:41.380> doesn't<00:02:41.530> like

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
whatever it was but yeah it doesn't like

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.530 
whatever it was but yeah it doesn't like
one<00:02:42.070> hit<00:02:42.250> a<00:02:42.280> be<00:02:42.400> demons<00:02:42.790> anymore<00:02:42.880> stuff<00:02:43.390> like

one hit a be demons anymore stuff like

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.880 
one hit a be demons anymore stuff like
that<00:02:43.570> so<00:02:43.960> you<00:02:44.020> know<00:02:44.200> it's<00:02:44.320> kind<00:02:44.500> of<00:02:44.560> whatever

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
that so you know it's kind of whatever

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.110 
that so you know it's kind of whatever
but<00:02:45.100> I<00:02:45.130> mean<00:02:45.370> it's<00:02:45.520> kind<00:02:45.700> of<00:02:45.760> you<00:02:46.090> know
