00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 You wouldn't do this, I mean it would be so destructive 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.500
 to drag your ass around the world on long tours except 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 if you really believe in what you do, and we still believe it. 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.000
 We keep on playing until we stop ourselves. 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 My attitude is that everyone who does not love U2 does not try hard enough. 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.500
 Although we have not announced anything yet, this tour might be expanded. 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 Songs that we thought could not be played are now starting to sound pretty good. 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.000
 They start to sound like songs we've been playing for 30 or 40 years. 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 People tell me, even if they don't like our band- 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.000
 if you go to a U2 show and the band comes on - 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.000
 - you could spontaneously get goosebumps through an involuntary action. 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.500
 People who don't like the band say this even happened to them. 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 What they don't know is that the same thing happens to us.
