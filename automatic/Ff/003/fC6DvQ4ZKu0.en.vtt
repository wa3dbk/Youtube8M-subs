00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.229 
able to identify some of the planets
that<00:00:28.980> are<00:00:29.310> visible<00:00:30.000> this<00:00:30.210> summer<00:00:31.700> so<00:00:32.700> first<00:00:33.149> of

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
that are visible this summer so first of

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.970 
that are visible this summer so first of
all<00:00:33.270> let's<00:00:33.480> start<00:00:33.930> with<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.260> sunset<00:00:34.469> itself

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
all let's start with the sunset itself

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.630 
all let's start with the sunset itself
and<00:00:35.250> as<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.410> sky<00:00:37.410> begins<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.860> darken<00:00:38.070> as<00:00:38.430> that

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
and as the sky begins to darken as that

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.700 
and as the sky begins to darken as that
red<00:00:38.879> glow<00:00:39.180> starts<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.840> fade<00:00:40.050> out<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.469> sky

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
red glow starts to fade out of the sky

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.420 
red glow starts to fade out of the sky
you'll<00:00:41.489> notice<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.910> really<00:00:42.239> bright<00:00:43.430> object

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
you'll notice a really bright object

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.369 
you'll notice a really bright object
floating<00:00:45.360> above<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.840> horizon<00:00:45.960> there<00:00:46.440> and

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
floating above the horizon there and

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:50.840 
floating above the horizon there and
you'll<00:00:49.379> probably<00:00:49.590> at<00:00:49.800> first<00:00:50.070> think<00:00:50.670> it's<00:00:50.760> an

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
you'll probably at first think it's an

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.610 
you'll probably at first think it's an
airplane<00:00:51.210> as<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.510> starts<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:51.960> get<00:00:52.020> darker<00:00:52.410> this

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
airplane as it starts to get darker this

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.049 
airplane as it starts to get darker this
thing<00:00:52.829> will<00:00:52.949> looking<00:00:53.219> amazingly<00:00:53.789> bright

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
thing will looking amazingly bright

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.819 
thing will looking amazingly bright
probably<00:00:54.539> even<00:00:54.600> brighter<00:00:54.960> than<00:00:55.230> airplanes

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
probably even brighter than airplanes

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.520 
probably even brighter than airplanes
that<00:00:55.920> are<00:00:56.039> in<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.250> sky<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.840> this<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:58.050> the

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
that are in the sky and this is the

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.090 
that are in the sky and this is the
planet<00:00:58.859> Venus<00:00:59.149> so<00:01:00.149> for<00:01:00.870> reference<00:01:01.260> I'm

2007 and Venus will be visible until
just<00:01:10.680> around<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.040> beginning<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.400> August<00:01:11.729> it's

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
just around the beginning of August it's

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.469 
just around the beginning of August it's
moving<00:01:12.990> closer<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.680> closer<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.909> earth<00:01:15.150> in

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
moving closer and closer to the earth in

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.679 
moving closer and closer to the earth in
its<00:01:15.780> orbit<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.610> as<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.790> does<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:17.970> in<00:01:18.540> about

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
its orbit and as it does so in about

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.740 
its orbit and as it does so in about
August<00:01:19.250> 15th<00:01:20.250> or<00:01:20.460> 16th<00:01:20.610> it's<00:01:21.060> going<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.330> passel

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
August 15th or 16th it's going to passel

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.899 
August 15th or 16th it's going to passel
through<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.259> line<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.610> plane<00:01:23.880> that

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
through that line of the plane that

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.440 
through that line of the plane that
connects<00:01:24.420> us<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.380> Sun<00:01:25.650> so<00:01:26.240> so<00:01:27.240> up<00:01:27.360> until

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
connects us to the Sun so so up until

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.359

star or an evening object and then a
couple<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.990> months<00:01:34.140> from<00:01:34.380> now<00:01:34.409> we<00:01:34.590> here<00:01:35.009> on

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
couple of months from now we here on

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.580 
couple of months from now we here on
this<00:01:35.340> fall<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:36.390> will<00:01:36.509> be<00:01:36.659> visible<00:01:37.350> in<00:01:37.470> the

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
this fall it will be visible in the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.190 
this fall it will be visible in the
morning<00:01:37.890> skies<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.159> morning<00:01:38.880> star<00:01:39.210> then<00:01:39.420> having

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
morning skies a morning star then having

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.410 
morning skies a morning star then having
passed<00:01:40.590> us<00:01:40.890> on<00:01:41.100> its<00:01:41.310> orbit<00:01:43.040> the<00:01:44.119> other<00:01:45.119> place

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
passed us on its orbit the other place

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.330 
passed us on its orbit the other place
that<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.780> can<00:01:45.869> look<00:01:46.259> as<00:01:46.500> if<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:46.890> book<00:01:47.070> due

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
that you can look as if you book due

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.569 
that you can look as if you book due
south<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:48.030> if<00:01:48.149> you're<00:01:48.360> looking<00:01:49.110> at<00:01:49.380> Venus<00:01:49.740> it's

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
south so if you're looking at Venus it's

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.510 
south so if you're looking at Venus it's
now<00:01:50.729> gotten<00:01:51.060> fairly<00:01:51.780> dark<00:01:52.110> out<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:53.250> sweep

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
now gotten fairly dark out and you sweep

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.899 
now gotten fairly dark out and you sweep
your<00:01:53.700> view<00:01:53.939> over<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.780> left<00:01:55.640> maybe<00:01:56.640> make

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
your view over to the left maybe make

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.300 
your view over to the left maybe make
like<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:58.110> know<00:01:58.170> quarter<00:01:58.590> turn<00:01:58.860> or<00:01:59.009> so<00:01:59.159> maybe

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
like a you know quarter turn or so maybe

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.490 
like a you know quarter turn or so maybe
a<00:01:59.460> little<00:01:59.579> bit<00:01:59.759> more

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
a little bit more

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.440 
a little bit more
the<00:02:01.190> bright<00:02:01.430> object<00:02:01.790> you'll<00:02:01.910> see<00:02:02.090> there<00:02:02.330> is

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
the bright object you'll see there is

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.810 
the bright object you'll see there is
the<00:02:02.480> planet<00:02:02.840> Jupiter<00:02:03.230> and<00:02:04.070> Jupiter<00:02:04.550> will<00:02:04.700> be

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
the planet Jupiter and Jupiter will be

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.130 
the planet Jupiter and Jupiter will be
visible<00:02:05.090> I<00:02:05.740> think<00:02:06.740> until<00:02:06.860> October<00:02:07.490> so<00:02:08.090> so<00:02:08.990> for

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
visible I think until October so so for

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.510 
visible I think until October so so for
the<00:02:09.200> rest<00:02:09.350> of<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.590> summer<00:02:09.740> you<00:02:09.920> would<00:02:10.280> be<00:02:10.429> able

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
the rest of the summer you would be able

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.830 
the rest of the summer you would be able
to<00:02:10.670> see<00:02:10.880> it<00:02:10.910> and<00:02:12.310> like<00:02:13.310> I<00:02:13.400> said<00:02:13.460> for<00:02:13.850> 2007<00:02:14.690> this

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
to see it and like I said for 2007 this

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.560 
to see it and like I said for 2007 this
is<00:02:14.960> the<00:02:15.140> place<00:02:15.530> where<00:02:15.740> though<00:02:15.860> be<00:02:16.010> a<00:02:16.040> Venus

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
is the place where though be a Venus

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.520 
is the place where though be a Venus
Horschel<00:02:17.570> shift<00:02:17.780> back<00:02:17.990> and<00:02:18.020> forth<00:02:18.200> between

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
Horschel shift back and forth between

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.440 
Horschel shift back and forth between
morning<00:02:18.890> and<00:02:19.100> evening<00:02:19.490> sky<00:02:19.730> on<00:02:19.970> a<00:02:20.000> regular

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
morning and evening sky on a regular

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.650 
morning and evening sky on a regular
pattern<00:02:21.550> Jupiter<00:02:22.550> will<00:02:23.030> slowly<00:02:23.300> kind<00:02:23.540> of

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
pattern Jupiter will slowly kind of

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.830 
pattern Jupiter will slowly kind of
creep<00:02:23.959> around<00:02:24.770> the<00:02:25.220> sky<00:02:25.690> completing<00:02:26.690> one

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
creep around the sky completing one

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.080 
creep around the sky completing one
orbit<00:02:27.140> every<00:02:27.230> 12<00:02:27.590> years<00:02:27.890> so<00:02:28.250> where<00:02:28.640> you<00:02:28.760> see<00:02:28.970> it

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
orbit every 12 years so where you see it

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.180 
orbit every 12 years so where you see it
now<00:02:29.480> it's<00:02:29.750> also<00:02:29.930> where<00:02:30.230> will<00:02:30.410> be<00:02:30.560> 12<00:02:30.950> years

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
now it's also where will be 12 years

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.160 
now it's also where will be 12 years
from<00:02:31.310> now<00:02:31.490> so<00:02:32.209> if<00:02:32.300> you<00:02:32.390> follow<00:02:32.570> say<00:02:33.050> for

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
from now so if you follow say for

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.979 
from now so if you follow say for
instance<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.560> Chinese<00:02:33.890> zodiac<00:02:34.420> then<00:02:35.420> this<00:02:35.750> is

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
instance the Chinese zodiac then this is

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.800 
instance the Chinese zodiac then this is
the<00:02:36.260> year<00:02:36.410> of<00:02:36.470> the<00:02:36.590> boar<00:02:37.090> also<00:02:38.090> known<00:02:38.540> as<00:02:38.690> the

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
the year of the boar also known as the

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.780 
the year of the boar also known as the
year<00:02:38.959> of<00:02:39.050> the<00:02:39.110> pig<00:02:39.350> you<00:02:40.190> wait<00:02:40.370> for<00:02:40.520> the<00:02:40.550> next

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
year of the pig you wait for the next

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.250 
year of the pig you wait for the next
year<00:02:40.940> of<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.090> boar<00:02:41.270> or<00:02:41.300> year<00:02:41.750> of<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:41.930> pig<00:02:42.050> and

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
year of the boar or year of the pig and

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.780 
year of the boar or year of the pig and
Jupiter<00:02:42.590> will<00:02:42.739> be<00:02:42.860> back<00:02:43.040> in<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:44.030> same<00:02:44.239> place

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
Jupiter will be back in the same place

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.870 
Jupiter will be back in the same place
so<00:02:46.790> starting<00:02:47.720> from<00:02:47.750> Jupiter<00:02:48.790> there's<00:02:49.790> a

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
so starting from Jupiter there's a

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.530 
so starting from Jupiter there's a
bright<00:02:50.480> star<00:02:50.840> that<00:02:51.050> will<00:02:51.140> be<00:02:51.230> visible<00:02:51.530> to<00:02:52.540> the

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
bright star that will be visible to the

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.330 
bright star that will be visible to the
right<00:02:53.840> of<00:02:53.989> it<00:02:54.080> we<00:02:54.590> need<00:02:54.709> to<00:02:54.830> the<00:02:54.920> right<00:02:55.100> and<00:02:55.280> a
