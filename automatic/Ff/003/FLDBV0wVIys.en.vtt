00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
harness so when you buy it or you get it

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.609 
harness so when you buy it or you get it
it's<00:00:15.660> going<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:15.870> come<00:00:16.049> with<00:00:16.230> something<00:00:16.410> like

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
it's going to come with something like

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.769 
it's going to come with something like
this<00:00:16.830> at<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.250> end<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.699> you<00:00:18.390> need<00:00:18.510> another

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
this at the end and you need another

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.939 
this at the end and you need another
clip<00:00:19.080> that<00:00:19.260> goes<00:00:19.410> over<00:00:19.859> that<00:00:21.050> to<00:00:22.050> get<00:00:22.650> your

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
clip that goes over that to get your

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.259 
clip that goes over that to get your
wires<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:24.090> come<00:00:24.269> through<00:00:25.880> which<00:00:26.880> is<00:00:27.060> going<00:00:27.210> to

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
wires to come through which is going to

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.900 
wires to come through which is going to
tell<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:27.689> which<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:27.900> 12<00:00:28.349> volt<00:00:28.619> 24<00:00:29.189> volt<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.849> so

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
tell you which is 12 volt 24 volt and so

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.440 
tell you which is 12 volt 24 volt and so
on<00:00:30.570> so<00:00:31.349> first<00:00:31.679> off<00:00:31.890> with<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.219> ICS<00:00:32.669> 300<00:00:33.239> series

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
on so first off with the ICS 300 series

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.729 
on so first off with the ICS 300 series
there<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.020> no<00:00:34.200> video<00:00:34.530> over<00:00:34.950> UTP<00:00:35.550> or<00:00:35.820> cat<00:00:36.660> 5<00:00:36.960> so

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
there is no video over UTP or cat 5 so

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.260 
there is no video over UTP or cat 5 so
you're<00:00:38.070> going<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.219> have<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.550> use<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.910> coax

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
you're going to have to use the coax

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.119 
you're going to have to use the coax
cable<00:00:39.450> so<00:00:40.410> don't<00:00:40.620> be<00:00:40.710> trying<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:40.980> look<00:00:41.100> for

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
cable so don't be trying to look for

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.869 
cable so don't be trying to look for
that<00:00:41.570> now<00:00:43.100> there<00:00:44.100> are<00:00:44.190> two<00:00:44.340> things<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:44.610> can<00:00:44.760> do

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
that now there are two things you can do

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.900 
that now there are two things you can do
here<00:00:45.020> we<00:00:46.020> can<00:00:46.200> do<00:00:46.350> 12<00:00:46.950> or<00:00:47.219> 12<00:00:48.090> volt<00:00:48.420> DC<00:00:48.660> or<00:00:49.910> 24

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
here we can do 12 or 12 volt DC or 24

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.439 
here we can do 12 or 12 volt DC or 24
volts<00:00:51.270> AC<00:00:51.739> now<00:00:52.739> most<00:00:53.100> 12<00:00:53.430> volt<00:00:53.699> power<00:00:53.969> supplies

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
volts AC now most 12 volt power supplies

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.729 
volts AC now most 12 volt power supplies
are<00:00:54.770> never<00:00:55.770> AC<00:00:56.340> so<00:00:56.910> it's<00:00:57.059> always<00:00:57.210> DC<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:57.960> that

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
are never AC so it's always DC and that

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.349 
are never AC so it's always DC and that
is<00:00:58.920> polarized<00:00:59.430> so<00:00:59.850> you're<00:01:00.030> going<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.180> have<00:01:00.300> to

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
is polarized so you're going to have to

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.540 
is polarized so you're going to have to
pay<00:01:00.480> attention<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.930> your<00:01:01.109> ground<00:01:01.379> or<00:01:01.710> negative

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
pay attention to your ground or negative

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.539 
pay attention to your ground or negative
and<00:01:02.730> your<00:01:03.059> power<00:01:03.300> or<00:01:03.660> positive<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.070> do<00:01:05.339> that

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
and your power or positive so to do that

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.370 
and your power or positive so to do that
you<00:01:06.270> are<00:01:06.299> going<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.750> want<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:06.960> hook<00:01:07.080> up<00:01:07.200> the

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
you are going to want to hook up the

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.910 
you are going to want to hook up the
black<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.720> white<00:01:09.720> black<00:01:09.990> wires<00:01:10.380> which<00:01:10.799> is

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
black and white black wires which is

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.260 
black and white black wires which is
going<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.070> be<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.310> solid<00:01:11.760> black<00:01:11.909> wire<00:01:12.240> here

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
going to be the solid black wire here

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.960 
going to be the solid black wire here
and<00:01:12.750> then<00:01:13.350> this<00:01:13.500> white<00:01:13.770> black<00:01:14.070> wire<00:01:14.400> here<00:01:14.700> so

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
and then this white black wire here so

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.719 
and then this white black wire here so
just<00:01:15.270> strip<00:01:15.509> them<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.460> twist<00:01:17.460> them<00:01:17.549> together

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
just strip them and twist them together

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.929 
just strip them and twist them together
and<00:01:18.090> put<00:01:18.320> electoral<00:01:19.320> tape<00:01:19.530> or<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.770> twist<00:01:20.490> cap<00:01:20.729> on

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
and put electoral tape or a twist cap on

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.399 
and put electoral tape or a twist cap on
there<00:01:21.090> or<00:01:21.180> something<00:01:21.540> so<00:01:21.990> they<00:01:22.080> don't<00:01:22.229> touch

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
there or something so they don't touch

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.380 
there or something so they don't touch
and<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:22.710> don't<00:01:22.860> get<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.979> short<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:24.119> that's

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
and you don't get a short so that's

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.240 
and you don't get a short so that's
going<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.600> be<00:01:24.720> your<00:01:24.840> ground<00:01:25.170> black<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.070> white

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
connection and then we're going to hook

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.399 
connection and then we're going to hook
up<00:02:04.939> video<00:02:05.210> so<00:02:05.659> as<00:02:05.750> you<00:02:05.840> can<00:02:05.960> see<00:02:06.020> here<00:02:06.289> that's

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
this so as you can see here these are

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.930 
this so as you can see here these are
the<00:02:38.060> three<00:02:38.420> connections<00:02:39.200> that<00:02:39.769> go<00:02:39.950> inside<00:02:40.610> the

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
the three connections that go inside the

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.100 
the three connections that go inside the
camera<00:02:41.269> in<00:02:41.510> the<00:02:41.599> back<00:02:41.780> here<00:02:43.480> one<00:02:44.480> is<00:02:44.750> the

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
camera in the back here one is the

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.210 
camera in the back here one is the
heater<00:02:45.709> I<00:02:46.220> think<00:02:46.579> it<00:02:46.700> is<00:02:46.819> this<00:02:47.150> one<00:02:47.480> or<00:02:48.220> this

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
heater I think it is this one or this

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.460 
heater I think it is this one or this
one<00:02:49.280> I'm<00:02:49.609> not<00:02:49.730> sure<00:02:49.790> and<00:02:50.299> then<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:50.959> other<00:02:51.290> one

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
one I'm not sure and then the other one

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.220 
one I'm not sure and then the other one
is<00:02:51.620> all<00:02:51.829> the<00:02:52.010> power<00:02:52.640> and<00:02:53.090> the<00:02:53.269> video<00:02:54.019> and

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
is all the power and the video and

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.530 
is all the power and the video and
whatnot<00:02:56.049> I<00:02:57.549> don't<00:02:58.549> think<00:02:58.700> this<00:02:58.790> is<00:02:58.850> for<00:02:59.150> an<00:02:59.209> ICS

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
whatnot I don't think this is for an ICS

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.020 
whatnot I don't think this is for an ICS
300<00:03:00.019> this<00:03:00.200> is<00:03:00.350> for<00:03:00.620> the<00:03:00.709> 310<00:03:01.100> I<00:03:01.130> believe<00:03:01.489> but

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
300 this is for the 310 I believe but

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.789 
300 this is for the 310 I believe but
it's<00:03:02.299> the<00:03:03.230> same<00:03:03.440> basic<00:03:03.650> idea<00:03:03.889> and<00:03:05.139> it<00:03:06.139> was<00:03:06.170> next

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
it's the same basic idea and it was next

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:10.210 
it's the same basic idea and it was next
