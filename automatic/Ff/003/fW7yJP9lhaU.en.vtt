00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.350
 I am Javier Javier Motta and today we are 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.420
 here in san francisco with the 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.520
 national presentation of the new 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.480
 seventh generation of golf 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:32.550
 generation of golf the German car that 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.460
 has been in the market for 40 years and has sold 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.770
 more than 30 million units one of 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.540
 the most successful cars in the history of 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.550
 the automotive industry in general does not 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.730
 only from the volkswagen 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.670
 to this new generation of golf and is 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.590
 based on the new platform of the group 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.960
 volkswagen which is a modular platform 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.329
 in which it allows you to manufacture 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.790
 different types of models on that 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.150
 same platform expanding the reducing 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.159
 making some adjustments so that 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.629
 can always be presented in a large 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:05.220
 number of different configurations 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.340
 for all group brands 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.869
 volkswagen starting obviously for this 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.470
 by the volkswagen group but also 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.440
 audi and porsche 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:18.770
 in europe it is coda 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:22.040
 another great novelty for the seventh 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.720
 generation of golf is that for the first 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.680
 is going to be produced in the plant 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.780
 mexico in puebla in mexico for help in 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.940
 logistics can be said of the plant 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.550
 silao where the engines are manufactured 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.010
 also in mexico silao guanajuato and 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.100
 populate in the state of the same name 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.870
 puebla in mexico 2015 is going to 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.120
 present in six different versions 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.940
 for the US market starting with 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.950
 this volt and is in the version more to more 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.760
 austere let's say you have the engine of 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:55.610
 1.8 liters with enough power 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.010
 for this type of car that is quite 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.979
 light and thanks as we said in the 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:03.500
 structure a new selection of 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:06.380
 materials and manufacturing processes that 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.590
 makes this small 1.8 engine 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.510
 liters generate 170 horsepower that 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.730
 allows you a handling from the most 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.380
 everyday let's say the most normal to go 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.069
 and come from work to the house to the 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.810
 office 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:22.580
 up to some certain performance let's say 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.770
 sports 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.140
 then comes the version and of 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.690
 there says the new generation of that 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.360
 technology says it's been done every time 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.480
 most popular here in the USA and that has a 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.970
 average yield of 35 miles per 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.520
 gallon of diesel and it's going to say gasoline 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.620
 by habit and it's really when 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.500
 is compared with models for example with 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.810
 hybrid technology really the 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.050
 performance performance everything is much 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.660
 better with a diesel engine 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.870
 the version also comes of course 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.210
 heat since it is one of the most followed 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.910
 that has more fans not only here in 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.190
 us but in the rest of the world in the 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:07.690
 high performance version later 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:10.990
 will come also the version r with arc de 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.120
 super high performance and unlike 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.770
 other generations of golf 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.450
 Volkswagen will not wait three years 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.040
 to attract that model but it's going to 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.190
 incorporate its products into its linear 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.680
 practically in the same year of the debut 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:27.160
 which will be for the end of 2014 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.290
 early 2015 they are also going to 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.700
 present a car for the first time 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.620
 electric an electric version 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.480
 totally electric to do 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.810
 competition with models like the nissan 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.880
 leaf 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.950
 so volkswagen enters the segment of 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.380
 the electric cars with the version and 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.840
 with the volkswagen completely 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.480
 electric that has will have a range of 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.459
 handling between 70 to 90 miles that's why 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.800
 assumed as everyone knows depends 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:54.500
 of the management style of the conditions 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.130
 of the weather the terrain so it's more than 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.330
 enough again for daily use 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:02.900
 almost 90 miles 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.519
 of independence range and finally 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.600
 the last version will come to the market 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:11.269
 station wagon that is let's say the version 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:14.840
 family the price range starts 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:17.030
 from a special price for this the 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.790
 debut of this new generation in a 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.709
 limited special edition that is going to 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.630
 determine according to the demand that goes to 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.780
 start around the 17 thousand dollars 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:30.410
 barely above 17 thousand dollars and 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:32.510
 when you go to the maximum range of golf 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:35.270
 with the performance baquets with all the 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:38.600
 possible options the total does not exceed 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:41.030
 35 thousand dollars so really a car 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.220
 that has it all good design a style 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.820
 and very attractive that can be from the 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:48.470
 regular edition until the r and has 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.950
 also the most advanced of the 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:55.010
 volkswagen technology a broad 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:58.340
 variety of engine train options with 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:01.490
 the diesel gasoline engine the electric 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:05.120
 in the r version so the new 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:07.930
 generation of volkswagen golf 2015 here 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.930
