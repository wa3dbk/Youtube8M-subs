for developers a year ago we announced

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.219 
for developers a year ago we announced
the<00:01:03.840> native<00:01:04.290> iPhone<00:01:04.860> SDK<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.820> with<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.750> we

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
the native iPhone SDK and with it we

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.859 
the native iPhone SDK and with it we
enable<00:01:07.619> developers<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.220> use<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.700> same<00:01:09.090> native

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
to build all of the applications that

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.920 
to build all of the applications that
ship<00:01:14.820> as<00:01:15.060> part<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.930> iPhone<00:01:16.430> now<00:01:17.570> our<00:01:18.570> goal

here<00:01:19.290> was<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:19.979> make<00:01:20.369> developers<00:01:21.200> successful

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
here was to make developers successful

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.640 
here was to make developers successful
we<00:01:23.009> gave<00:01:23.189> them<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.520> best<00:01:23.909> tools<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.810> api's

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
we gave them the best tools and api's

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.640 
we gave them the best tools and api's
and<00:01:25.920> frameworks<00:01:26.400> ever<00:01:27.140> for<00:01:28.140> building

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
and frameworks ever for building

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.219 
and frameworks ever for building
applications<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.850> what<00:01:30.570> they<00:01:30.689> did<00:01:30.930> with<00:01:31.110> this

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
applications and what they did with this

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.330 
applications and what they did with this
blew<00:01:32.100> us<00:01:32.400> away<00:01:32.729> as<00:01:33.409> Josh<00:01:34.409> oh<00:01:34.619> it's<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.920> tune<00:01:35.100> of
