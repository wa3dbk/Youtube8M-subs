00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.510
 according to many scientists 

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:05.970
 average person uses 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.700
 capabilities of your brain by 35 percent 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.580
 if at 7 then this is already an outstanding person 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.889
 for 12 or more is a genius given note on 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.870
 one hundred percent of the brain is not used and no one 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.970
 here's how to use it to its fullest 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.039
 to and problems solve complex memory 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.020
 train learn our doctor mass 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.019
 horns single dollar good morning good morning 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.050
 from where such a low efficiency is five percent 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.939
 from all our big brains that here 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.740
 we do wrong we may miss 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.290
 nerve cells there any of these 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.790
 processes associated with memory memorization 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.530
 with the analysis information does not depend 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.260
 somewhat on the number of neurons we have 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.600
 here on the number of links between 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.950
 neurons the more connections the better with 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.180
 you understand that is the main principle 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.550
 memory development 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.289
 this increase in the connection between their 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.449
 uneven well but how to implement it 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.809
 In practice, this is a crossword task 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.620
 elements to introduce them and you know it 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:59.489
 enough ways 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.020
 tedious difficult I don't take into account 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.049
 crossword puzzles that our fellow citizens 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.729
 flick subway cars great russian 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.700
 the poet on on begins on the ears not 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.729
 ends up there is a way easier is better 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.010
 and more effectively we call it the sherlock method 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.409
 holmes and remember what is connected 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.689
 deduction alen deduction founded before 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.520
 just on observation you can bring such 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.130
 An example that people living in Moscow I 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.009
 convinced many people do not even know how much it 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.860
 do you understand, therefore , in their house 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.820
 easy way start to train 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.250
 observation did come out this morning 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.159
 now our rivers are going across 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.720
 go out to see how much 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.030
 cars at the door which color 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.520
 they dominate yes what brand 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.520
 prevails what color sandals have 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.720
 Alena today Alex 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:51.780
 shoes probably all the same she does not 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:54.370
 sandals are not too but gray well 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.290
 light yes well, here's an example you understand the check 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.460
 working with a lot of information he's in 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.710
 principle understands what is at stake 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.180
 observer on pyaterochka but ok but 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.560
 nevertheless if constantly so here 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.390
 watch everything and everything 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.050
 to look and listen simply 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.540
 head resting rarely constantly do not have to 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.550
 10-15 minutes a day, 4 times turn on your 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.070
 observant understand and the body and 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.290
 you will be told a big thank you attic like 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.030
 such important things as pour 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.650
 when the ability to generalize to 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.040
 make the right conclusions like this 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.870
 train know here it lies here 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.220
 the main secret of the physiology of our brain 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.959
 up as soon as we turn on you 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.370
 watchfulness yes immediately included 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.510
 analyst you will not get away from this 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.760
 accept it 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.680
 Well, how do you say on the topic we go to 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.110
 car on an unfamiliar road like us 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.180
 eat quietly gently peeking 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.370
 the angle that there is like someone not to knock down than 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.209
 more often we drive that road faster 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.580
 our speed 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.799
 exactly there in our nervous system too 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.510
 the more often we have the impulse running from one 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.190
 neuron to another the higher the speed and 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.130
 find therefore 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:00.250
 shiva cams first saw the doctor 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.519
 watson newspaper one mans pocket 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.170
 jacket and then concluded that 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.330
 probably came to not from Kharkov to from 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.040
 edinburgh all so train your 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.720
 observation is very simple 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.730
 Cheap and effective way to get started 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.890
 think more effectively and 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.390
 the operative mansar thank you very much 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.220
 We are waiting for Thursday with the next portion 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.220
 healthy advice with pleasure
