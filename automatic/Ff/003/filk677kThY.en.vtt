00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:14.110
 here and another part of our today's 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:17.010
 lesson this work 40 glass that is on 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:20.590
 it is also engraved 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.439
 Well, in our case, it will be 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.239
 the option that we have here 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:28.029
 plexiglass 4 millimeters thick 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:31.029
 here I have already made one option 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.590
 it will be applied on one side 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:36.840
 he will print 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:39.220
 and on the other hand apparently 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.930
 the outline of the drawing will be made 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.310
 engraving 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.680
 that is, now I will show you how it is 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:49.830
 will be done for starters we put 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:52.830
 photo printing here we washed the glass 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:56.650
 now basically as repeatedly 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:01:00.070
 saw the principle of work we remove we tear off 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:05.310
 plenochku and substrate I by the way for 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.310
 photo print all these moments choose 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:13.359
 matte lamination film because 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:16.869
 that it is less transparent and if its 

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:20.170
 use without additional background then 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:25.090
 there is a bit less opaque 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:27.880
 transparent, in principle, what is the effect 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.590
 which in this case is needed yes and 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.869
 In general, it is more convenient for me to work 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:36.929
 maybe this information will be you 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:39.429
 useful that is if you are on this matte 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:41.530
 on this matte version will cause 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:45.980
 any transparent glossy film 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:02:02.410
 then it will become more transparent 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:02:05.090
 there is magic if you apply it 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:11.630
 glossy transparent film it will become 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:14.330
 transparent more transparent like this 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:18.620
 detail and we ended up putting it 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:21.560
 on a light napkin first to be softer 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:26.420
 was working and that all were visible 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:28.430
 outlines of leaves that I will now 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.740
 they perform engraving that is and 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.630
 we will engrave directly by 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:38.060
 contour highlighting them that is how 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:43.100
 done here these details and since this 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:46.220
 the item will be the continuation of this we will 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.940
 execute only one leaf 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.530
 which will be a continuation of here 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.920
 my main pic 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:58.490
 what we do for that well first 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:06.200
 change the nozzle with which we worked with and 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:09.680
 glass to another too everything is all so 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:14.570
 say I found experimentally 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:18.100
 I discovered everything in my work 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:21.620
 nozzle so she looks 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.530
 very good doing a deep cut in 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.860
 glass courtyard 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:30.380
 On the principle of simple glass, she too 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.280
 behaves well again this is all here 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.280
 and crazy know 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:45.230
 nozzles we fix think over 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.940
 but 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.290
 but 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.790
 but 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.790
 but 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.270
 but 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:26.750
 so I kind of finished my engraving 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:31.620
 fox. 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:35.490
 the continuation of a leaf so to say that 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:39.620
 eventually it happened and what you want to say and 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:43.560
 that by looking at how this or that works 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:46.170
 nozzle what she what what effect 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:51.390
 can be achieved with its help 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:54.900
 Well, then go on like this 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:57.000
 say more artistic option 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:01.670
 that is, and somewhere tinted again 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:04.110
 use some kind of bathroom taps 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:06.180
 shading surfaces create 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.060
 such a matte effect 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.220
 somewhere to do veins well like mine 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.080
 vein leaflets 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:16.050
 thicker thinner that is 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.020
 somehow allocate separate one leaflet 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.490
 from another there are some moments 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.810
 when you start to understand at work 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:26.360
 how does it all work 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:28.680
 what effect is achieved 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.950
 use of one or another nozzle here 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.180
 already more interesting and already somehow 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:36.060
 more exciting already want to do something 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:41.910
 so how would the work as a whole be 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:44.520
 cool interesting so that's what i 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:50.220
 I wanted to show you to demonstrate in 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:51.950
 this tutorial how to say even before progress 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:56.480
 what progress has come 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:59.310
 that is why I advise you to master 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:03.300
 be interested in what is on the market in your 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:06.360
 cities and maybe it's fascinating 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.610
 occupation will be an occupation that will be 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.370
 bring you income 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.930
 so since this topic is now very 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:16.890
 interesting and relevant all sorts of products 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:19.560
 which and there are some kind of me 

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:22.220
 do-it-yourself 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:24.500
 demand so interesting 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:27.600
 use your works 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:29.610
 look at what happened 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.669
 of our today's lesson 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.249
 that is, here is such a lamp, we 

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:37.629
 receive 

00:06:33.249 --> 00:06:43.719
 or how do you see the engraving we 

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:47.099
 performed it more pronounced now when 

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:47.099
 backlight 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:12.680
 now look at all three of ours 

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:16.919
 lamp 

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:19.950
 the same principle of work but changed 

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:22.530
 changes in the very decor of the lamp and 

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:24.720
 see that the effect is different 

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:29.010
 you can use different lights 

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:29.460
 play as if with this and achieve different 

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:32.490
 such 

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:37.850
 color effects on this our lesson 

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:37.850
 over all good to new ideas
