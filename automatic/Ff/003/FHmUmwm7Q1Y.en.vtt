00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:22.510 
knocked out I'm tired I just finished it

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.269 
knocked out I'm tired I just finished it
I<00:00:22.779> just<00:00:23.410> figured<00:00:23.800> I'd<00:00:23.890> give<00:00:24.039> these<00:00:24.160> a<00:00:24.220> quick

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:24.279 
I just figured I'd give these a quick

peek<00:00:26.010> axial<00:00:27.660> scx10<00:00:29.310> my<00:00:30.310> big<00:00:30.670> problem<00:00:31.179> with<00:00:31.359> it

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
peek axial scx10 my big problem with it

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.080 
peek axial scx10 my big problem with it
I<00:00:31.689> don't<00:00:31.990> like<00:00:32.320> the<00:00:32.830> servo<00:00:33.400> sitting<00:00:33.820> on<00:00:33.940> the

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
I don't like the servo sitting on the

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.910 
I don't like the servo sitting on the
axle<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:36.480> there<00:00:37.480> quite<00:00:38.080> a<00:00:38.110> few<00:00:38.200> companies<00:00:38.650> out

this<00:01:30.820> is<00:01:30.970> what<00:01:31.120> they<00:01:31.240> call<00:01:31.450> a<00:01:31.750> pan<00:01:32.230> hard<00:01:32.950> link

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:34.230 
this is what they call a pan hard link

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.390 
this is what they call a pan hard link
okay<00:01:35.230> we're<00:01:35.380> a<00:01:35.409> panhard<00:01:35.980> bar<00:01:36.780> alright

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
okay we're a panhard bar alright

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.890 
okay we're a panhard bar alright
I<00:01:38.540> think<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.720> it's<00:01:40.350> made<00:01:40.680> out<00:01:40.800> of<00:01:40.830> aluminum<00:01:41.900> the

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
I think it it's made out of aluminum the

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.350 
I think it it's made out of aluminum the
machining<00:01:43.470> is<00:01:43.590> excellent<00:01:44.190> they<00:01:44.880> milled<00:01:45.180> it

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
machining is excellent they milled it

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.510

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
out oh well you can see that it's very

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.740 
out oh well you can see that it's very
light<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:51.560> just<00:01:52.560> think<00:01:52.770> it's<00:01:52.980> it's<00:01:53.760> killer<00:01:54.030> it

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
light I just think it's it's killer it

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.840 
light I just think it's it's killer it
just<00:01:55.020> adds<00:01:55.260> so<00:01:55.530> much<00:01:55.710> realism<00:01:56.370> to<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.610> front

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
two rails it's not actually mounted it's

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.350 
two rails it's not actually mounted it's
just<00:02:16.770> wedge<00:02:17.100> between<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.670> two<00:02:17.820> rails<00:02:18.150> and

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
just wedge between the two rails and

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.810 
just wedge between the two rails and
when<00:02:18.510> you<00:02:18.630> put<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:19.310> plastic<00:02:20.310> brace<00:02:20.580> bone

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
when you put the plastic brace bone

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.990 
when you put the plastic brace bone
across<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.390> rails<00:02:21.600> inside<00:02:21.990> yet<00:02:22.290> it<00:02:23.100> pinches
