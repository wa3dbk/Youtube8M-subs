00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.460
 well, this video is going to be treated 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:06.710
 about how to know if the regulator 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.929
 voltage is working well today is 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.540
 starting to fail this becomes evident 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:14.840
 in voltage measurements 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.760
 in the battery for that I need what 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.130
 It is a multimeter 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.690
 and we will have cables 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.700
 directly to the battery posts 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:26.390
 from cable to red we will place it at 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:29.360
 positive post and the cable will make black 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.140
 negative post right now we're going to check in 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.360
 the battery charge at this time 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.930
 portaje put them in power 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.880
 direct 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.150
 the cut affects us is marking a 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.850
 voltage of 12.6 of this voltage is 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.100
 well 12.6 or more indicates that the battery 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.960
 is charged one hundred percent does 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.550
 point four indicates that the battery is 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:55.670
 charged to 75% 12.2 that the battery is 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:01:00.010
 50 percent 12 volts 12 volts 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:03.370
 indicates that the battery is at 25% 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.860
 and all this 12.7 or less indicates that the 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.380
 battery is discharged right now 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.720
 battery is ok is dialing us 12.6 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.909
 but to check if the regulator is 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.070
 working what you have to do is 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.020
 start the engine is what we are going to 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.830
 do now to check again 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.830
 again the voltage 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:33.759
 the voltage going up to 13.8 13.9 or 14 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.520
 bags should be in that range for 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.649
 tell us what 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.420
 that the regulator is working well and 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.130
 that the battery is charging 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.140
 correctly 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.690
 there we see how it is going up at that point 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.030
 9 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.830
 right now is telling us that the 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.260
 alternator gives in this case that is a 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.110
 generator is perfectly charging the 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.150
 battery and the regulator is doing its 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.110
 work that is regulating 14 new 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.640
 volts 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.960
 which is what the battery should 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.690
 load 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.960
 if it is below those 13 points 9 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:08.149
 13 points 5 - giant at 12 bosh 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.120
 indicates that the regulator is already failing 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.850
 the 100 highest voltages of 14 volt 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.350
 let's say about 15 balls and the regulator 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.870
 it is also already failing it is sending 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.930
 too much load and that's going to cause 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.569
 we damage the battery 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:27.040
 then the range should be between 13 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:29.890
 points 7 to 14.1 balls to say that a 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.140
 regulator is working well in this 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.300
 case then 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.340
 the assembly that marks us is within the 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.230
 range means that you are doing 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.560
 perfectly your work there is no 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.560
 failure 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.770
 another question has this case as 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.260
 we have a bag that is using a 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.990
 generator in an alternator we can see 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.390
 that although the engine is running in the 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.940
 charging voltage has dropped to 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:59.070
 12.4 these private generators ports 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.230
 doing their job according to the 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.000
 engine revolutions but if 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.500
 we accelerate the motor of this voltage 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.600
 have to go up to 14 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.880
 approximately and not go beyond 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.710
 although revolutions rise more than 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.690
 lived then what we are going to do 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.990
 right now so you can see 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.990
 this 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.860
 As we can see, another one is transferred 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.860
 thing 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.060
 how it is accelerated which has to pass 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.170
 of this constant 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.400
 I follow more bots 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.379
 someday this morning 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.890
 a laps and let's point to the assembly 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:39.590
 to work with him 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.160
 generator stops putting more load was not 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.160
 nothing for him 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.850
 and there we can see how this goes down 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.850
 descent
