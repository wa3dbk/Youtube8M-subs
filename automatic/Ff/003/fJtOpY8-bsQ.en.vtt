00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.120 
taking a look at something kind of
interesting<00:00:12.660> for<00:00:13.290> those<00:00:13.410> people<00:00:13.769> out<00:00:13.920> there

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
interesting for those people out there

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.490 
interesting for those people out there
who<00:00:14.250> only<00:00:14.460> want<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:14.790> upgrade<00:00:15.150> their<00:00:15.630> CPU<00:00:16.260> and

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
who only want to upgrade their CPU and

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.920 
who only want to upgrade their CPU and
don't<00:00:16.859> care<00:00:17.190> about<00:00:17.490> upgrading<00:00:18.090> their<00:00:18.210> GPU<00:00:18.720> to

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
don't care about upgrading their GPU to

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.500 
don't care about upgrading their GPU to
anything<00:00:19.199> by<00:00:19.410> Nvidia<00:00:20.000> now<00:00:21.000> there's<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.359> new

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
anything by Nvidia now there's a new

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.040 
anything by Nvidia now there's a new
chipset<00:00:21.900> out<00:00:22.080> this<00:00:22.439> is<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:23.090> 970<00:00:24.090> chipset<00:00:24.570> now

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
chipset out this is the 970 chipset now

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.900 
chipset out this is the 970 chipset now
the<00:00:25.109> 990<00:00:25.769> chipset<00:00:26.220> we've<00:00:26.340> introduced<00:00:26.730> that's

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
the 990 chipset we've introduced that's

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.390 
the 990 chipset we've introduced that's
a<00:00:26.970> 990<00:00:27.420> FX<00:00:27.720> chipset<00:00:28.140> that<00:00:28.619> supports<00:00:29.099> crossfire

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
a 990 FX chipset that supports crossfire

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.380 
a 990 FX chipset that supports crossfire
and<00:00:30.029> sli<00:00:30.720> this<00:00:31.470> motherboard<00:00:31.820> only<00:00:32.820> supports

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
and sli this motherboard only supports

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.290 
and sli this motherboard only supports
crossfire<00:00:33.750> does<00:00:34.440> not<00:00:34.590> support<00:00:34.829> SLI<00:00:35.340> at<00:00:35.489> all<00:00:35.640> so

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
crossfire does not support SLI at all so

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.370 
crossfire does not support SLI at all so
that's<00:00:36.480> one<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.750> drawbacks<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:37.290> this

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
that's one of the drawbacks of this

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.200 
that's one of the drawbacks of this
motherboard<00:00:37.710> but<00:00:38.489> for<00:00:38.730> those<00:00:38.790> people<00:00:39.000> who

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
motherboard but for those people who

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.520 
motherboard but for those people who
don't<00:00:39.360> care<00:00:39.600> about<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:39.899> all<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.410> what

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
don't care about that all and it is what

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.500 
don't care about that all and it is what
I<00:00:40.559> put<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.100> bulldozer<00:00:41.579> or<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.969> latest<00:00:42.120> Liana

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
I put the bulldozer or the latest Liana

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.080 
I put the bulldozer or the latest Liana
CPUs<00:00:43.140> this<00:00:43.620> motherboard<00:00:43.980> supports<00:00:44.309> all<00:00:44.730> that

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
CPUs this motherboard supports all that

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.490 
CPUs this motherboard supports all that
so<00:00:45.420> now<00:00:45.539> let's<00:00:45.750> jump<00:00:45.930> in<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.079> take<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.260> look<00:00:46.350> at

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
so now let's jump in and take a look at

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.490 
so now let's jump in and take a look at

SATA cables that's basically it these

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.140 
SATA cables that's basically it these
are<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.560> new<00:01:37.680> SATA<00:01:37.950> 3<00:01:38.070> standard<00:01:38.700> tend<00:01:39.090> to

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
are the new SATA 3 standard tend to

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.830 
are the new SATA 3 standard tend to
worry<00:01:39.270> about<00:01:39.450> that

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
worry about that

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.160 
worry about that
everything<00:01:40.380> comes<00:01:40.590> inside<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:40.950> box<00:01:42.170> the

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
everything comes inside the box the

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.480 
everything comes inside the box the
other<00:01:43.619> way<00:01:43.860> we'll<00:01:44.070> take<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.250> look<00:01:44.399> the

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
other way we'll take a look the

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.400 
other way we'll take a look the
motherboard<00:01:44.850> itself

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.110 

it's<00:01:48.410> a<00:01:48.470> full-size<00:01:48.830> motherboard<00:01:49.370> pretty

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
look at the motherboard start out you

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.000 
look at the motherboard start out you
can<00:02:02.690> see<00:02:02.810> it's<00:02:02.960> very<00:02:02.990> well<00:02:03.320> made<00:02:03.350> it's<00:02:03.830> not

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
can see it's very well made it's not
