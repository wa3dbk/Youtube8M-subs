 I don't feel like feathers 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.479
 This seems to be easy to process 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.750
 I feel like I 'm going to be cool when I'm done 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.750

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.790
 Click here 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:02.530
 Trapezoid Hadoro height is very of-filled print 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.370
 Then 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.150
 Trapezoidal Ha Not Hard 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:11.569
 This one 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:13.610
 Well, I do not have a direct relationship, but this time 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.170
 Hyper dash circuit 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:22.260
 If you are 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:27.380
 Manya little so we think I stand mobile Yao to use it or because the little people normally proposal 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.380
 This is a strong armor, there is a possibility to use this 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.110
 so 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.310
 It is wheel is called the trapezoid Low height of here Parker to match the tire 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.750
 [musics] 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.960

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.110
 All this 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:43.160
 It is this height together 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:48.370
 There is no difference between front and rear 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:49.830
 I want to use this, but I feel like it's a waste 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.130
 Yes and 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:56.550
 Here red colored ma chassis 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:00.010
 This isn't it, but according to the rumor 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:04.440
 It seems easy to crack or rather brittle 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:06.819
 We hear a little talk, but how is it actually? 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:11.960
 I would like to compare a little 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:16.160
 It looks like a measuring instrument that measures hardness, but I would like to use it, though 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:18.960
 The people of the edition do n't have a bit anymore, right? 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.700

 One you saying? But I want 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.600
 It is a pity 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.600
 Yes 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:37.100
 It's like tar already , but it's like this, but the day is that it's a large diameter tire. 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.370
 It is an 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.370
 Ah 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:49.680

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:56.610
 A bright yellow or a somewhat deep yellow 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:03.390
 It's a dark yellow 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:08.819
 I'm looking at the camera screen now, but I feel a bit light 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:12.390
 Depth even this fact is I have become totally dark, such the reflected in the feeling like a light yellow 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:14.260
 It is dark yellow with 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.389
 I feel like 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:21.949
 Let's adjust the same negligence 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:27.240
 Still because it looks a little bright color because Yes transmitted in such a feeling 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:29.110
 Well, it's a dark yellow, it's a solid yellow.

 I'm worried I'm wondering if you are here 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.550

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:06.360
 Ne 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:06.360
 I think I should study what

 Shape like this 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:17.680
