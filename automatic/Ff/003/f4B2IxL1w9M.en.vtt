00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
for that is that we want the sandstorm

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.609 
for that is that we want the sandstorm
weather<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.610> fall<00:01:50.820> off<00:01:51.060> reasonably<00:01:51.990> shortly

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
after a grumbly comes out but we'll

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.940 
after a grumbly comes out but we'll
worry<00:01:54.869> about<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:55.079> in<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.350> minute<00:01:55.439> here<00:01:55.770> so

worry about that in a minute here so

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.800 
worry about that in a minute here so
it's<00:01:56.159> time<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.369> deflect<00:01:56.939> another<00:01:57.390> rupture

it's time to deflect another rupture

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.090 
it's time to deflect another rupture
here<00:01:58.320> we<00:01:58.439> go<00:01:58.969> no<00:01:59.969> rupture<00:02:00.479> for<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.320> more

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
here we go no rupture for you and more

nicely whenever you manage to hit and

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.089 
nicely whenever you manage to hit and
then<00:02:05.939> sandstorms<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.750> mitigating<00:02:07.500> lots<00:02:07.950> of

that other

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.270 
that other
he's<00:02:10.399> doing<00:02:10.670> there<00:02:10.849> perfect<00:02:11.980> so<00:02:12.980> I<00:02:13.190> think

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
he's doing there perfect so I think

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.800 
he's doing there perfect so I think
about<00:02:13.610> sandstorm<00:02:14.000> here<00:02:14.180> but<00:02:14.270> I<00:02:14.300> decide<00:02:14.599> not<00:02:14.630> to

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
about sandstorm here but I decide not to

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.150 
about sandstorm here but I decide not to
because<00:02:15.140> Cromley<00:02:15.470> doesn't<00:02:15.770> have<00:02:15.920> all<00:02:16.130> that

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
because Cromley doesn't have all that

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.559 
because Cromley doesn't have all that
much<00:02:16.430> health<00:02:16.640> left<00:02:16.790> so<00:02:17.030> we're<00:02:17.150> gonna<00:02:17.239> go<00:02:17.450> ahead

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
much health left so we're gonna go ahead

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.949 
much health left so we're gonna go ahead
and<00:02:17.690> crush<00:02:17.930> instead<00:02:18.530> and<00:02:19.720> save<00:02:20.720> that

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959
