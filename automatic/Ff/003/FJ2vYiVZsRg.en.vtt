of<00:00:07.109> Weber<00:00:07.919> 44<00:00:08.730> IDF<00:00:09.510> carburetors<00:00:10.230> now<00:00:11.130> I<00:00:11.160> just

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
of Weber 44 IDF carburetors now I just

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.440 
of Weber 44 IDF carburetors now I just
picked<00:00:12.000> these<00:00:12.150> up<00:00:12.210> from<00:00:12.900> being<00:00:13.590> rebuilt

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
picked these up from being rebuilt

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.390 
picked these up from being rebuilt
I<00:00:15.480> had<00:00:15.870> them<00:00:15.960> rebuilt<00:00:16.350> at<00:00:16.560> air-cooled

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
that that the guys over at air-cooled

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.690 
that that the guys over at air-cooled
engineering<00:00:31.439> did<00:00:31.619> namely<00:00:32.009> Dave<00:00:32.640> at<00:00:33.180> Ace<00:00:34.700> did

engineering did namely Dave at Ace did
on<00:00:35.820> these<00:00:35.969> carbs<00:00:36.710> just<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.770> little<00:00:37.950> background

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
on these carbs just a little background

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.000 
on these carbs just a little background
I<00:00:38.910> picked<00:00:39.390> up<00:00:39.510> these<00:00:39.719> carburetors<00:00:40.260> for

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
I picked up these carburetors for

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.569 
I picked up these carburetors for
replacements<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.180> some<00:00:42.629> dalorto<00:00:43.500> 45s<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.550> I

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
replacements of some dalorto 45s that I

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:51.260 
replacements of some dalorto 45s that I
had<00:00:44.850> on<00:00:45.120> my<00:00:46.910> 2007<00:00:47.910> CC<00:00:48.600> Volkswagen<00:00:49.320> engine<00:00:50.270> had

years something like that
unfortunately<00:01:01.440> one<00:01:01.649> winter<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.100> couldn't<00:01:02.940> have

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
unfortunately one winter I couldn't have

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.840 
unfortunately one winter I couldn't have
the<00:01:03.149> car<00:01:03.359> garaged<00:01:03.799> didn't<00:01:04.799> have<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.949> garage<00:01:05.159> at

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
the car garaged didn't have a garage at

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.390 
the car garaged didn't have a garage at
the<00:01:06.060> time<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.570> unfortunately<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.560> sat<00:01:07.830> out<00:01:08.010> in

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
the time and unfortunately it sat out in

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.950 
the time and unfortunately it sat out in
the<00:01:08.520> winter<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.090> little<00:01:09.420> bit<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:09.600> water<00:01:09.720> got

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
the winter and a little bit of water got

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.679 
the winter and a little bit of water got
down<00:01:10.140> into<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.860> one<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.640> carburetors<00:01:12.180> one

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
down into the one of the carburetors one

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.020 
down into the one of the carburetors one
of<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.840> dual<00:01:12.960> or<00:01:13.080> no<00:01:13.229> carbs<00:01:13.700> basically<00:01:14.700> seized

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
of the dual or no carbs basically seized

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.859 
of the dual or no carbs basically seized
up<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.390> shaft<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.900> just<00:01:16.020> made<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.290> junk<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:17.869> so

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
up the shaft and just made it junk so so

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.300 
up the shaft and just made it junk so so
I<00:01:18.900> ended<00:01:19.140> up<00:01:19.229> picking<00:01:19.439> up<00:01:19.710> these<00:01:19.890> carburetors

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
I ended up picking up these carburetors

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.679 
I ended up picking up these carburetors
here<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:22.430> here<00:01:23.430> locally<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.240> these<00:01:24.450> ones

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
here and here locally and these ones

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.320 
here and here locally and these ones
also<00:01:24.900> sat<00:01:25.320> these<00:01:25.560> are<00:01:25.710> genuine<00:01:25.979> web<00:01:26.250> 444<00:01:26.909> IDF's

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
also sat these are genuine web 444 IDF's

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.069 
also sat these are genuine web 444 IDF's
as<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.170> can<00:01:28.320> see<00:01:28.590> they<00:01:28.860> are<00:01:29.479> you<00:01:30.479> know<00:01:30.570> made<00:01:30.960> in

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
as you can see they are you know made in

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.700 
as you can see they are you know made in
Italy<00:01:31.380> it's<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.590> little<00:01:31.799> blurry<00:01:31.950> there<00:01:33.710> let's

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
Italy it's a little blurry there let's

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.359 
Italy it's a little blurry there let's
see<00:01:34.920> if<00:01:34.979> we<00:01:35.100> can<00:01:35.280> zoom<00:01:35.460> in<00:01:36.000> there<00:01:36.860> on<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.159> one

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
see if we can zoom in there on that one

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:45.020 
see if we can zoom in there on that one
they're<00:01:39.829> still<00:01:40.829> blurry<00:01:41.220> there<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:44.030> anyhow

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
they're still blurry there so anyhow

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.300 
they're still blurry there so anyhow
pick<00:01:45.509> these<00:01:45.659> up<00:01:45.720> because<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.770> actually<00:01:46.920> tried

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
pick these up because I actually tried

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.609 
pick these up because I actually tried
getting<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.670> dalorto<00:01:47.970> rebuilt<00:01:48.619> at

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
getting the dalorto rebuilt at

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.219 
getting the dalorto rebuilt at
air-cooled<00:01:50.250> engineering<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:50.909> they<00:01:51.750> after

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
air-cooled engineering and they after

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.569 
air-cooled engineering and they after
they<00:01:52.350> kind<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.619> disassembled<00:01:53.340> them<00:01:53.460> and

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
they kind of disassembled them and

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.100 
they kind of disassembled them and
looked<00:01:53.700> at<00:01:53.850> them<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.060> said<00:01:54.240> cow<00:01:54.450> man<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:55.020> know

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
looked at them and said cow man you know

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.100 
looked at them and said cow man you know
we're<00:01:55.350> gonna<00:01:55.439> have<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:56.579> know<00:01:56.640> spend<00:01:57.110> $800

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
we're gonna have to you know spend $800

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.859 
we're gonna have to you know spend $800
or<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:58.439> just<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.860> get<00:01:59.040> these<00:01:59.189> things<00:01:59.869> running

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
or so just to get these things running

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.389 
or so just to get these things running
so<00:02:01.259> they<00:02:01.439> said<00:02:01.649> you're<00:02:01.770> better<00:02:01.890> off<00:02:02.009> finding

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
so they said you're better off finding

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.370 
so they said you're better off finding
yourself<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.909> good<00:02:03.090> set<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.390> Weber<00:02:03.689> 40<00:02:04.110> fours

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
yourself a good set of Weber 40 fours

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.429 
yourself a good set of Weber 40 fours
and<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:05.310> know<00:02:05.430> we'll<00:02:06.000> rebuild<00:02:06.689> those<00:02:07.079> and

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
and you know we'll rebuild those and

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.169 
and you know we'll rebuild those and
you'll<00:02:07.799> be<00:02:07.950> animal<00:02:08.250> s<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.640> then<00:02:08.729> I<00:02:08.819> can<00:02:08.970> sell

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
you'll be animal s and then I can sell

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.190 
you'll be animal s and then I can sell
the<00:02:09.300> de<00:02:09.420> lordos<00:02:09.720> for<00:02:09.929> parts<00:02:10.229> but<00:02:12.170> anyhow<00:02:13.170> so

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
the de lordos for parts but anyhow so

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.660 
the de lordos for parts but anyhow so
what<00:02:13.440> they<00:02:13.560> did<00:02:13.620> is<00:02:13.920> when<00:02:14.069> they<00:02:14.220> they

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
what they did is when they they

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.339 
what they did is when they they
disassembled<00:02:15.270> them<00:02:15.420> they<00:02:15.660> they<00:02:16.050> media

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
disassembled them they they media

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:17.540 
disassembled them they they media
blasted<00:02:16.770> them<00:02:16.860> so<00:02:17.010> if<00:02:17.069> you<00:02:17.190> look<00:02:17.340> at<00:02:17.459> these

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
blasted them so if you look at these

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.910 
blasted them so if you look at these
carburetors<00:02:18.200> normally<00:02:19.200> what<00:02:19.349> happens<00:02:19.770> with

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
carburetors normally what happens with

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.250 
carburetors normally what happens with
these<00:02:20.069> things<00:02:20.129> is<00:02:20.550> they<00:02:20.700> they<00:02:20.970> just<00:02:21.000> get<00:02:21.540> you

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
these things is they they just get you

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.440 
these things is they they just get you
know<00:02:22.349> when<00:02:22.470> they<00:02:22.620> sit<00:02:22.950> on<00:02:23.400> an<00:02:23.580> engine<00:02:23.970> or<00:02:24.150> in

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
know when they sit on an engine or in

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.210 
know when they sit on an engine or in
storage<00:02:24.810> or<00:02:24.900> whatever<00:02:24.989> they<00:02:25.290> just<00:02:25.319> get<00:02:25.680> dirt

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
storage or whatever they just get dirt

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.580 
storage or whatever they just get dirt
and<00:02:26.430> junk<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:27.090> grime<00:02:27.360> all<00:02:27.569> over<00:02:27.870> them<00:02:27.989> so

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
and junk and grime all over them so

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.470 
and junk and grime all over them so
these<00:02:28.709> have<00:02:28.950> actually<00:02:29.310> been<00:02:29.459> media<00:02:30.060> blasted

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
these have actually been media blasted

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.729 
these have actually been media blasted
or<00:02:30.599> be<00:02:30.780> blasted<00:02:32.030> in<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.269> blasting<00:02:33.750> cabinet<00:02:33.959> so

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
or be blasted in a blasting cabinet so

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.009 
or be blasted in a blasting cabinet so
the<00:02:34.860> car<00:02:35.040> bodies<00:02:35.430> are<00:02:35.580> just<00:02:35.989> you<00:02:36.989> know

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
the car bodies are just you know

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.300 
the car bodies are just you know
absolutely<00:02:37.620> pristine<00:02:38.300> you<00:02:39.300> know<00:02:39.420> everywhere

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
absolutely pristine you know everywhere

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.839 
absolutely pristine you know everywhere
and<00:02:41.310> then<00:02:41.430> they<00:02:41.519> did<00:02:41.670> a<00:02:41.700> complete<00:02:42.390> rebuild<00:02:42.840> on

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 
and then they did a complete rebuild on

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:47.360 
and then they did a complete rebuild on
both<00:02:44.849> these<00:02:45.000> carburetors<00:02:45.890> of<00:02:46.890> course<00:02:47.160> they're

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
both these carburetors of course they're

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.880 
both these carburetors of course they're
jetted<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:48.209> set<00:02:48.420> up<00:02:48.569> for<00:02:48.900> my<00:02:49.110> my<00:02:49.470> two<00:02:49.530> liter

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
jetted and set up for my my two liter

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.650 
jetted and set up for my my two liter
art<00:02:50.190> was<00:02:50.640> actually<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.030> one<00:02:51.120> that<00:02:51.180> built<00:02:51.480> that

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
art was actually the one that built that

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.390 
art was actually the one that built that
2<00:02:51.840> liter<00:02:53.030> engine<00:02:54.030> that<00:02:54.150> I<00:02:54.180> have<00:02:54.569> and<00:02:55.220> so<00:02:56.220> he

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
2 liter engine that I have and so he

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.339 
2 liter engine that I have and so he
knows<00:02:56.580> all<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:57.360> components<00:02:57.840> that<00:02:57.870> were<00:02:58.050> in<00:02:58.200> it

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
knows all the components that were in it

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.399 
knows all the components that were in it
and<00:02:58.560> was<00:02:58.920> able<00:02:58.950> to<00:02:59.190> get<00:02:59.370> him<00:02:59.519> set<00:02:59.760> up<00:03:00.409> and

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:01.409 
and was able to get him set up and

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:04.430 
and was able to get him set up and
dialed<00:03:01.860> in<00:03:02.010> for<00:03:02.970> me<00:03:03.209> so<00:03:03.750> basically<00:03:03.930> all<00:03:04.230> I<00:03:04.349> have

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
dialed in for me so basically all I have

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.589 
dialed in for me so basically all I have
to<00:03:04.620> do<00:03:04.739> is<00:03:04.860> just<00:03:04.980> bolt<00:03:05.190> them<00:03:05.340> on<00:03:05.459> and<00:03:05.790> go<00:03:06.330> I

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
to do is just bolt them on and go I

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.390 
to do is just bolt them on and go I
don't<00:03:06.720> have<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:06.989> mess<00:03:07.530> around<00:03:07.709> with<00:03:08.040> the

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
don't have to mess around with the

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.089 
don't have to mess around with the
stoick<00:03:09.120> ometer<00:03:09.540> and<00:03:09.840> you<00:03:10.500> know<00:03:10.620> checking<00:03:11.040> the

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
stoick ometer and you know checking the

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.240 
stoick ometer and you know checking the
air<00:03:11.190> fuel<00:03:11.459> ratio<00:03:11.700> and<00:03:12.629> and<00:03:13.500> doing<00:03:13.739> all<00:03:13.890> that<00:03:14.040> it

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
air fuel ratio and and doing all that it

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.949 
air fuel ratio and and doing all that it
should<00:03:14.430> all<00:03:14.550> be<00:03:14.580> set<00:03:15.180> up<00:03:15.300> ready<00:03:15.540> to<00:03:15.750> rock<00:03:15.930> and

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
should all be set up ready to rock and

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:22.580 
should all be set up ready to rock and
roll<00:03:19.909> my<00:03:20.909> favorite<00:03:21.269> part<00:03:21.540> of<00:03:21.599> these<00:03:21.810> are<00:03:22.379> these

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
roll my favorite part of these are these

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.910 
roll my favorite part of these are these
little<00:03:23.480> plates<00:03:24.480> that<00:03:24.810> that<00:03:25.319> aren't<00:03:25.530> has<00:03:25.680> their

little plates that that aren't has their

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.160 
little plates that that aren't has their
it<00:03:25.980> looks<00:03:26.129> like<00:03:26.250> they're<00:03:26.400> laser<00:03:27.239> laser

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
it looks like they're laser laser

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.009 
it looks like they're laser laser
engraved<00:03:28.650> they're<00:03:29.330> totally<00:03:30.330> stoked<00:03:30.599> on<00:03:30.810> those
