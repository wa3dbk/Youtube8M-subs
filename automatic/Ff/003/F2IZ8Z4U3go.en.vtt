00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
it is the very experience of working on

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.520 
it is the very experience of working on
cinema<00:02:35.040> that<00:02:35.340> contributes<00:02:35.940> to<00:02:36.530> to

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
cinema that contributes to to

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.590 
cinema that contributes to to
discovering<00:02:38.190> facets<00:02:38.610> to<00:02:38.730> yourself<00:02:39.150> you<00:02:39.570> know

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
discovering facets to yourself you know

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.980 
discovering facets to yourself you know
along<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.140> art<00:02:40.500> form<00:02:40.860> on<00:02:41.730> this<00:02:42.180> journey<00:02:42.420> so<00:02:42.810> I

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
along the art form on this journey so I

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.960 
along the art form on this journey so I
I<00:02:44.120> I'd<00:02:45.120> have<00:02:45.660> to<00:02:45.780> say<00:02:46.020> yeah<00:02:46.860> every<00:02:47.370> experience

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
I I'd have to say yeah every experience

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.570 
I I'd have to say yeah every experience
contributes<00:02:48.750> but<00:02:49.260> there<00:02:49.410> isn't<00:02:49.560> any<00:02:49.830> specific

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
contributes but there isn't any specific

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.790 
contributes but there isn't any specific
one<00:02:50.940> that<00:02:50.970> you'd<00:02:51.300> necessarily<00:02:51.540> you<00:02:52.320> know<00:02:52.350> draw

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
one that you'd necessarily you know draw

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.220 
one that you'd necessarily you know draw
from<00:02:53.220> or<00:02:53.520> make<00:02:53.730> notes<00:02:53.970> on<00:02:54.240> because<00:02:54.690> that's

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
from or make notes on because that's

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.050 
from or make notes on because that's
life<00:02:55.530> and<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:56.220> you<00:02:56.459> know<00:02:56.580> there's<00:02:56.940> this<00:02:57.000> whole

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
life and and you know there's this whole

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.430 
life and and you know there's this whole
thing<00:02:57.240> with<00:02:57.510> art<00:02:57.690> imitates<00:02:58.050> life<00:02:58.110> and

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
thing with art imitates life and

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.180 
thing with art imitates life and
vice-versa

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
vice-versa

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.460 
vice-versa
but<00:02:59.760> I<00:03:00.180> think<00:03:00.510> that's<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.810> magic<00:03:01.170> of<00:03:01.260> cinema

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
but I think that's the magic of cinema

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.230 
but I think that's the magic of cinema
you<00:03:01.890> don't<00:03:02.130> know<00:03:02.310> when<00:03:02.490> exactly<00:03:03.120> you're

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
you don't know when exactly you're

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.870 
you don't know when exactly you're
drawing<00:03:03.570> from<00:03:03.720> a<00:03:04.530> particular<00:03:05.190> experience

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
drawing from a particular experience

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.460 
drawing from a particular experience
it's<00:03:06.090> all<00:03:06.209> about<00:03:06.390> interpretation<00:03:06.660> and<00:03:07.350> just

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
it's all about interpretation and just

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.410 
it's all about interpretation and just
becoming<00:03:07.830> um<00:03:08.520> when<00:03:08.880> I<00:03:08.910> saw<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.120> presentation

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
becoming um when I saw the presentation

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.090 
becoming um when I saw the presentation
there<00:03:09.930> seems<00:03:10.170> to<00:03:10.230> be<00:03:10.290> so<00:03:10.500> many<00:03:10.590> images<00:03:10.860> that

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
there seems to be so many images that

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.740 
there seems to be so many images that
I've<00:03:11.190> never<00:03:11.340> seen<00:03:11.580> before<00:03:11.970> and<00:03:12.239> so<00:03:12.660> I'm

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
I've never seen before and so I'm

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.000 
I've never seen before and so I'm
wondering<00:03:12.959> like<00:03:13.260> what's<00:03:13.560> this<00:03:13.709> film<00:03:13.920> very

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
wondering like what's this film very

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.770
