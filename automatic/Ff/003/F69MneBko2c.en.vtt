00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.710
 The Netherlands 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:54.140
 He was a colleague and a top but 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.760
 is a goal you were unbeatable from 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.890
 the other route Jan our line keeper 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.710
 hatching was not a hysterical point but 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.850
 glossy and eventually dismantled 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.549

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.969
 lyons on 

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:16.729
 our mother sat at night behind us 

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:19.100

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:23.179
 we always call the mb's your standing 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.819
 who were relaying hearing aids and 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:28.009
 a public man from dark chocolate chocen 

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:30.890
 but it's a tennis match 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:33.350
 was that hyper hyper nervous that is on it 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.810
 bite the nails and walked around and then 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.840
 had to walk but choco man planches 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.259
 a man in error was that 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.920
 composing 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.119
 just a pity that the panel itself will 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.509
 never to reach an agreement may 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.880
 come 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:49.009
 yes, because with retroactive effect that is 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.079
 now even more unfortunate that he could not handle 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.709
 with the role that the dominant ajacied 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:53.899
 played 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:55.369
 yes so if you contact he stool 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.579
 the with Johan Cruijff through a door and 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:01.130
 good as a dog rails best at best 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:03.860
 certain players were now Johan Cruijff 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.020
 yes then you're stuck anyway 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.520
 like best keeper and not together 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.679

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.209
 Sure and the coach cees on hold 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.459
 him and put down in 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.110
 yes for Johan Cruijff a big de 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.900
 and IJssel was at that time great as 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.269
 the pvv small and land could be said 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.910
 then not when depositing and then just the 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:24.560
 best to play yes your fixed costs 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.560
 the mossy buster 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.170
 but unfortunately a pity and I just find it 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.459

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.890

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:56.120
