 wild water of the lavish planet of 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.770
 anastasia bedard vice and an orange 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.540
 pastel that is still quite lively in 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.120
 anyway I leave it in three teachers 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.430
 only my eyelid compatible and 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.989
 used three hues of color in the 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.940
 hollow to have a kind of degrade of 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.829
 day I go now to the chocolate 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.710
 bar 2 to pay and I just took 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.020
 this color which is a kind of brown 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.789
 with bunkers have just orange and 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.320
 it's a parent who's just perfect 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.510
 with her makeup so I joust 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.220
 also in the hollow to bring a 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.880
 a little bit more depth and 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.979
 have also degrades and progressive I 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.100
 do not forget to blur between 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.390
 every step and I finish the vintage with 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.520
 is always tired of the same palette 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.409
 which is the most landed tool not the 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.909
 all in the same tone and he I the 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.860
 place mainly in the corner 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.750
 external I go back slightly but not 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.220
 too much I really insist on the corner 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.530
 external to bring to his father a 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.430
 little bit that side and always brought 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.530
 this harvest 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.560
 depth that makes the magic of croque 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.330
 dead yesterday and for the mobile eyelid I 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.580
 passes to the poker queen godfather always of 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.320
 the the usual the first one is a 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.780
 kind of totally matte cream color 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.490
 with under very light orange 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.600
 or just perfect beige for this type of 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:51.750
 makeup I go back to the palette that 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.540
 almost sorry and here I take the makeup 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.580
 cream matt flesh color that I have 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.830
 ironed on my dowser give a 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:03.149
 look injury a little bit more 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.860
 closeup more lichte also I like 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.780
 a lot of verses this look with deco if the 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.850
 especially worry it's the 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.869
 iphones uk of house of machine and they 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.360
 are beautiful 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.550
 it really gives a magnified view 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.540
 just magic between told me that 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.340
 do you think I find that change 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.860
 you can totally quite the 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.840
 father positive point it also works in 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.390
 a first time ge apic glue that 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.010
 always give from below flashy 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.110
 so the same site I click on go on 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.420
 the border of the land and this one is 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.980
 great because the applicator tip 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.290
 is really practical and she sticks 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.150
 as well she is almost transparent 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.670
 it does not make white residue evokes 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.290
 sometimes rather than to and after having 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.720
 let the fossil dry a few 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.000
 seconds until the glue of the 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.790
 links a little bit more sticky and and that the 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.130
 white a little disappears that game 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.630
 just click so I'm going 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.799
 really special technique I 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.840
 go to the trouble that and he's in a 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.820
 first time and after game this game there 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.730
 just his contribution from my mail with the 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.110
 drugs and I stay closer to the 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.910
 root and 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.760
 I'm ready to come here to 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.930
 perfect inflation and all 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.660
 fossils that I could try 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.400
 try some it's the first 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.380
 that I find so easy to ask 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.240
 frankly elsewhere and that must have been 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.150
 shown suffers and yet I am not 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.500
 all he experts too bad if I love 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.820
 to apply to me it is true that I put 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.230
 sometimes quite a bit of time and there you 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.920
 see that in a few seconds to hushovd 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:28.230
 and waiting for the dry rind is 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.060
 wise very quickly at key jacky pass 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.440
 round pharma polish from the palette to 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.660
 lower buttocks of the lower lashes 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:41.040
 I hope the people of Syrte the most 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:42.660
 provided a little bit of eyes and for the 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.030
 touch of light I can only count 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.770
 their brand idols like 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.440
 by first light are a little say 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.850
 ready for really amazing ideas he 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.470
 approached digital as a person and 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.660
 so of their place in the inner corner 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.390
 eye and I do not want to go it 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.890
 zoom in on the eye again and that's fine 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.010
 also go with their inhabitants who 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.170
 is relatively gorilla and bright 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.060
 i also dream too much by mbark of my 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.989
 click and smile for the occasion 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.060
 what are we doing 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.760
 I put it at the edge of the eyelashes in celebration 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.370
 will have fossil levels to hide 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.380
 the glue to hide a little bit is the 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.840
 band to be and you just have 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.640
 to bring us a little melted on 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.080
 can also put eye liner 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.270
 I had not read because precisely 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:28.580
 I kept the look pretty simple bubble 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:30.740
 thinks pat too forgot to say it 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.120
 but just as well, you have to put 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.400
 just flush with the lashes and several 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:38.629
 ways to hide a little misery 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.550
 on my early syllab base pencil is at 

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:42.710
 new part of gama tv not if you 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.080
 you realize but there 's a novel the 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.669
 little girl darling is pretty and 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.259
 to apply a first layer of 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:49.939
 mascara whose application of the conflict 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:52.039
 as for Cuba's small name today 

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:53.599
 all the time but he does not know the arms 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:55.250
 in fact I just apply to the root 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:57.050
 very slightly just to melt 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.340
 I think we sometimes not so 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.500
 let's apply to the flush of the eyelashes 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:04.099
 inferior because otherwise it makes 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.870
 weird it's a little sick and the 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:07.190
 trick to finish the makeup of 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.719
 eyes when hanging possible 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.610
 even when you do not bring me his name but 

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:13.580
 still it is to apply a pencil 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.990
 black white got one either in the end that 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.629
 transfer me to an inner box 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:19.190
 depth compass and so seven past 

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:22.039
 and I use the park are made amine 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.629
 of this art so this is a version 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:26.509
 miniature that you will present in a 

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:28.159
 bet very soon I love it ig 

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:30.740
 is not completely martigues is enough 

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:31.310
 bright we were not completely 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.770
 magnetic 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.930
 here and I help little as the called 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:38.150
 small world will sell their times 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.870
 to complete a little bit everywhere during the 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.870
 summit is approaching 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:47.270
 for hurting me I pass to the sata type and 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.740
 network jean bettencourt has since 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.530
 is absolutely perfect for this kind of 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.510
 makeup since he has some 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:56.300
 dialyzed satin a little water but who 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:58.370
 are perfect for the world and I have 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.800
 not finished with the light I steal 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:05.000
 such highlighter manaudou banaliseur 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:06.680
 here are two albums and who is I believe the 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.730
 the most intense reactor I have 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:12.590
 he is really radiant my little trick 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.420
 for that uniform lipsticks 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.650
 stand out all the more it's apply 

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.420
 this product so in fact you can 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.940
 apply any foundation 

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:22.130
 concealer concealer in fact on your 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.810
 lips it's just to make them 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.520
 actually disappear really well 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.740
 neutralize a little bit of the front to make 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.230
 more and so in this case when 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:32.600
 we talk about color I use this term to 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:35.510
 clips insight 2 oakard and he is 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:37.250
 absolutely amazing it's a real 

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:39.590
 orange orange 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.910
 that feels to the end but is not 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.440
 not completely maths but is not 

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:45.620
 glosses in more than one end achieved 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:49.100
 it is very very moisturizing and there is a 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:50.570
 superb outfit so he has it all for him if 

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.370

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:55.190
 expensive and the level going towards one from 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:57.830
