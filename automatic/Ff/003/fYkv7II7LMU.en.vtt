 Supporting the channel, you're just kidding. 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.459
 So, let's go, but here we are. 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.680
 because my name is merit of the code 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.659
 here on youtube for you who think that I 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.220
 messi of the code and appear to 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:41.159
 To say that I'm good to say that I 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.840
 I'm fucking not the average code name 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:45.509
 has a story is a story was 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.370
 elastic and such but has a history by 

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:48.720
 behind my code master name I'm going to 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.750
 explain a little to you here 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.909
 now organized my name of Messi do 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.449
 code was because of the black ops two 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:56.579
 cars 

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:58.650
 I started in 2003 I played very well there 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:01.169
 but the game is something I think I play 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.720
 best bel 2 and why decided to bet 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:04.739
 in that code it has been nothing but expensive 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.870
 was as follows 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.299
 For those who do not know my original account 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.040
 My account and I always played it, it's roger. 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:13.079
 garden for those who do not know too 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.030
 my name is roger will travel to explain 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:16.560
 A bit later for you too 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.840
 so why 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.730
 and I put the master of the expensive code I 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.639
 it was on my roger account already playing 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:26.460
 very happy and the bell 3 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:28.500
 the bel 3 2 in a game that I could get 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.270
 my account and I had no more 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.760
 Nothing we're going to do is each one can and I 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.010
 I really like a code I played a lot 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:38.400
 games can be given three years ago since 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:41.070
 when you released game code then you already had 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.510
 I got messi on my account in the story. 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.000
 original in the face and had no more to 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:47.400
 to do then was that I decided it was 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.389
 An account first I wanted account 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.560
 x Myth of the x code after I create the 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:54.690
 average of the code 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.680
 In this account a lot of the code I played 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:01.050
 Little in it there I got it light 55 is because 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.510
 account that leaves the first 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.760
 prestige for all the bell codes 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.820
 a little leaving the maximum level and 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:11.729
 number 2 and leaving 55 and stopped playing 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.590
 It was then that I decided to create an account 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:15.270
 to get me the most fish then it was 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.610
 that's where I created my messi account 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.380
 code was an account to fool because I 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.930
 I already had messi in my original account 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.060
 so I decided that a new account also 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.770
 catch master since I really like 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.229
 see you two had nothing left to 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.330
 me to do so it was so used 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:33.300
 here my name on youtube and messi do 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.680
 code because I was sick of playing 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.380
 in my account I went there and created a 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:41.039
 new account an idea on psn to play 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:43.470
 Then I put in x code master x 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:45.930
 so that's why my name on the 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.389
 youtube is master of the code used 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.979
 you think that I'll have messi can 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:51.990
 also appear as I said before no 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:54.240
 face and come out with this story is a 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.520
 history was elastic but this was 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.580
 story that gave me the motivation to 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.139
 code master on my channel 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.500
 and another thing like I said my name is 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:06.900
 roger charles and roger I 've read is not the name 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.970
 nice to face right channel the name that will 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.220
 pick up and such and I think messi 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:13.139
 code the name very flashy then 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:17.130
 It was also so be sure to put 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:18.930
 there in my channel organized in Bethlehem then 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.419
 This was the story of the channel name. 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:23.490
 Dude, I hope you enjoyed it. 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:26.280
 like you already know leave it there and that 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:28.260
 favorite part of the video link and the 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.599
 channel and leave me a comment to find 

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:32.669
 one of this video here guy was not a 

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:36.960
 excellent story in the face but your 

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:39.210
 history and what kind to create the name 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:43.229
 of my channel and beauty then used 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:47.990
 Let's stay here and say more. 

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:47.990
 and it was
