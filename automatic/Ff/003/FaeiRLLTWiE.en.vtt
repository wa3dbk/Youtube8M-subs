00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
a checker board in Minecraft and decided

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.080 
a checker board in Minecraft and decided
that<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.979> turtles<00:01:08.490> will<00:01:08.729> represent

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
that the turtles will represent

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.660 
that the turtles will represent
checkered<00:01:09.600> pieces<00:01:10.049> so<00:01:10.619> without<00:01:11.159> any<00:01:11.369> further

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
checkered pieces so without any further

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.010 
checkered pieces so without any further
explanation<00:01:11.880> I'd<00:01:12.479> like<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.750> show<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:12.900> guys
