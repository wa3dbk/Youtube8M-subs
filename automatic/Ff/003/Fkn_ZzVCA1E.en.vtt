00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:54.139
 our homeland that does not matter the 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.269
 social status they have because there 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:03:00.349
 a state that accompanies them that 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:03.250

 better of itself and there's going to be a state 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:15.319
 through scholarships through chickens 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.709

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.150
 be more fair so that the one who arrives will be 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.519
