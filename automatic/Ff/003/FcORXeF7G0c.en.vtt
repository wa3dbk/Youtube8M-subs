okay<00:00:01.530> so<00:00:01.589> what<00:00:01.949> we<00:00:02.070> have<00:00:02.220> here<00:00:02.429> is<00:00:02.520> an<00:00:02.669> asus

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
okay so what we have here is an asus

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.340 
okay so what we have here is an asus
motherboard<00:00:03.410> with<00:00:04.410> a<00:00:04.819> USB<00:00:05.819> issue<00:00:06.240> and<00:00:06.960> network

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
motherboard with a USB issue and network

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.730 
motherboard with a USB issue and network
card<00:00:07.589> issue<00:00:07.770> and<00:00:08.690> what<00:00:09.690> our<00:00:09.840> user<00:00:10.080> is<00:00:10.349> stating

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
card issue and what our user is stating

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.919 
card issue and what our user is stating
is<00:00:10.920> that<00:00:10.950> they<00:00:11.400> apply<00:00:11.910> pressure<00:00:12.179> to<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.599> Intel

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
is that they apply pressure to the Intel

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.760 
is that they apply pressure to the Intel
chip<00:00:12.960> here<00:00:13.440> and<00:00:13.650> it<00:00:14.219> causes<00:00:14.690> the<00:00:15.690> ports<00:00:16.619> to

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
chip here and it causes the ports to

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.740 
chip here and it causes the ports to
start<00:00:17.039> working<00:00:17.430> so<00:00:17.699> what<00:00:18.119> we're<00:00:18.240> gonna<00:00:18.330> do<00:00:18.600> is

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
start working so what we're gonna do is

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.080 
start working so what we're gonna do is
take<00:00:18.960> it<00:00:19.109> put<00:00:19.260> it<00:00:19.289> on<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.560> machine<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:23.090> take

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
take it put it on the machine and take

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.179 
take it put it on the machine and take
it<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.359> heat<00:00:24.539> it<00:00:24.689> up<00:00:24.810> now<00:00:25.410> when<00:00:25.619> we<00:00:25.740> received

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
it and heat it up now when we received

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.830 
it and heat it up now when we received
it<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.609> was<00:00:26.910> like<00:00:27.300> this<00:00:27.539> so<00:00:29.539> we're<00:00:30.539> just<00:00:30.570> gonna

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
it it was like this so we're just gonna

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.959 
it it was like this so we're just gonna
go<00:00:31.080> with<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.529> hopefully<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.520> heat<00:00:32.759> pipe

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
go with it hopefully that heat pipe

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.340 
go with it hopefully that heat pipe
doesn't<00:00:33.270> mess<00:00:33.540> up<00:00:33.570> but<00:00:34.190> for<00:00:36.350> denotation

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
doesn't mess up but for denotation

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.330 
doesn't mess up but for denotation
that's<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.820> p5e<00:00:38.820> deluxe<00:00:39.469> asus<00:00:40.469> motherboard<00:00:40.710> so

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
that's a p5e deluxe asus motherboard so

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.979 
that's a p5e deluxe asus motherboard so
we're<00:00:42.030> gonna<00:00:42.120> go<00:00:42.360> with<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.840> see<00:00:42.960> what

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
we're gonna go with it and see what

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.580 
we're gonna go with it and see what
happens<00:00:44.600> so<00:00:45.600> we're<00:00:45.960> gonna<00:00:46.079> heat<00:00:46.320> everything

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
happens so we're gonna heat everything

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.119 
happens so we're gonna heat everything
up<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.190> go<00:00:47.309> from<00:00:47.520> there<00:00:47.700> okay<00:00:48.710> so<00:00:49.710> we're

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
up and go from there okay so we're

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.240 
up and go from there okay so we're
allowing<00:00:50.430> our<00:00:50.789> board<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.390> get<00:00:51.920> heat<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.070> up<00:00:53.539> and

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
allowing our board to get heat it up and

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.540 
allowing our board to get heat it up and
we're<00:00:56.250> actually<00:00:56.430> gonna<00:00:56.789> have<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.270> probably<00:00:58.550> do

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
we're actually gonna have to probably do

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.900 
we're actually gonna have to probably do
some<00:00:59.820> manipulation<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.600> get<00:01:00.750> this<00:01:01.550> arm<00:01:02.550> over

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
some manipulation to get this arm over

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.140 
some manipulation to get this arm over
top<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.629> but<00:01:04.729> we're<00:01:05.729> going<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.970> actually

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
top of it but we're going to actually

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.590 
top of it but we're going to actually
allow<00:01:06.930> this<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.350> heat<00:01:07.500> up<00:01:07.530> but<00:01:07.979> we've<00:01:08.390> put<00:01:09.390> a

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
allow this to heat up but we've put a

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.929 
allow this to heat up but we've put a
cleaner<00:01:09.930> on<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:11.100> make<00:01:11.460> sure<00:01:11.490> that

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
cleaner on it to make sure that

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.870 
cleaner on it to make sure that
everything's<00:01:12.420> good<00:01:12.900> as<00:01:13.080> far<00:01:13.260> as<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.560> goes<00:01:13.880> so

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
everything's good as far as that goes so

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.050 
everything's good as far as that goes so
now<00:01:15.270> we're<00:01:15.540> going<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:16.640> start<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.729> warming

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
now we're going to start the warming

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.740 
now we're going to start the warming
process<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:19.049> go<00:01:19.200> into<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.799> actual<00:01:20.570> lighten<00:01:21.570> it

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
process to go into the actual lighten it

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.620 
process to go into the actual lighten it
up<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.229> heating<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.799> with<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.250> IR<00:01:24.150> system

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
up and heating it with the IR system

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.410 
up and heating it with the IR system
okay<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:25.590> now<00:01:26.250> we've<00:01:26.490> started<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:27.060> heating

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
okay so now we've started the heating

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.870 
okay so now we've started the heating
process<00:01:27.710> and<00:01:29.600> we're<00:01:30.600> gonna<00:01:30.750> allow<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.880> heat

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
process and we're gonna allow it to heat

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
process and we're gonna allow it to heat
as<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.180> normally<00:01:33.329> does<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:35.360> do<00:01:36.360> what<00:01:36.509> needs<00:01:36.720> to

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
as it normally does and do what needs to

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.679 
as it normally does and do what needs to
do<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.590> actually<00:01:38.210> get<00:01:39.210> this<00:01:39.390> system<00:01:41.509> heated<00:01:42.509> up

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
do to actually get this system heated up

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:49.460 
do to actually get this system heated up
in<00:01:45.680> reset<00:01:46.680> for<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:46.979> reflux<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:48.329> we<00:01:48.930> do<00:01:49.079> notice

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
in reset for the reflux so we do notice

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.359 
in reset for the reflux so we do notice
some<00:01:49.920> small<00:01:50.759> amounts<00:01:51.240> of<00:01:51.829> smoke<00:01:52.829> coming<00:01:53.280> off

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
some small amounts of smoke coming off

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.789 
some small amounts of smoke coming off
of<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.700> as<00:01:53.909> we<00:01:54.720> can<00:01:54.750> see<00:01:54.930> coming<00:01:55.350> out<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.649> front

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
of it as we can see coming out the front

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.310 
of it as we can see coming out the front
here<00:01:56.130> that's<00:01:56.850> just<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.390> cleaner<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.930> we're

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
here that's just the cleaner that we're

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.539 
here that's just the cleaner that we're
using<00:01:59.810> that<00:02:00.810> we<00:02:00.990> use<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.500> prep<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.950> board<00:02:02.219> and

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
using that we use to prep the board and

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.780 
using that we use to prep the board and
press<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.689> chipsets<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:05.070> we're<00:02:05.369> gonna<00:02:05.460> allow

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
press the chipsets so we're gonna allow

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.270 
press the chipsets so we're gonna allow
that<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:06.509> actually

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
that to actually

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.940 
that to actually
burn<00:02:08.850> off<00:02:09.090> it's<00:02:09.420> not<00:02:09.600> a<00:02:09.660> major<00:02:09.840> problem<00:02:10.170> and

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
burn off it's not a major problem and

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.700 
burn off it's not a major problem and
we're<00:02:11.220> going<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.460> allow<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.730> chipset<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.710> get

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
we're going to allow the chipset to get

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.970 
we're going to allow the chipset to get
the<00:02:14.570> actual<00:02:15.570> flow<00:02:15.870> that<00:02:16.140> it<00:02:16.230> needs<00:02:18.680> and<00:02:19.680> get

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
the actual flow that it needs and get

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.950 
the actual flow that it needs and get
what<00:02:20.190> it<00:02:20.280> needs<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.730> get<00:02:20.910> done<00:02:21.300> so<00:02:21.660> we're<00:02:21.840> going

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
what it needs to get done so we're going

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.630 
what it needs to get done so we're going
to<00:02:22.020> allow<00:02:22.230> this<00:02:22.470> to<00:02:23.180> reflow<00:02:24.180> itself<00:02:24.570> and<00:02:25.640> do

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
to allow this to reflow itself and do

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.670 
to allow this to reflow itself and do
what<00:02:26.850> it<00:02:26.940> needs<00:02:26.970> to<00:02:27.210> do<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:28.260> then<00:02:28.410> we're<00:02:28.560> going

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
what it needs to do and then we're going

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.680 
what it needs to do and then we're going
to<00:02:28.740> call<00:02:28.920> it<00:02:29.070> finish<00:02:29.580> we'll<00:02:30.000> just<00:02:30.150> say<00:02:30.300> this<00:02:30.480> is

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
to call it finish we'll just say this is
