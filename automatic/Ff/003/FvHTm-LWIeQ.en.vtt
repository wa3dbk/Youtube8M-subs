00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 in Krasnoyarsk launch similar 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.600
 quadrocopter in the courtyard of high-rise buildings 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.880
 turned around for the local large 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.190
 fine transport prosecutor's office 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.360
 regarded it as a violation of the rules 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.969
 airspace use 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.330
 because the man sent without a carpenter but in 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.400
 sharpened 20 25 meters why outlaw 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.460
 turned out to be even toys or our strength 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.710
 correspondent Oleg Borisov on the first 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.269
 look ordinary toy cheapest 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.250
 cost several thousand rubles even 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.410
 special joystick need not control 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.420
 You can use the smartphone to buy in 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.130
 normal store and all instructions from 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.210
 seller takes about ten seconds 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.210
 bans not a word 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:44.640
 Here residents of Krasnoyarsk fined 3 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.010
 thousand rubles if you believe his protocol 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.719
 the device rose to 25 meters but this 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.940
 was enough to go beyond 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.379
 the law of uncontrolled movement 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.360
 city ​​airspace 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.440
 about the size of an aircraft 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.660
 0.5 meter by 0.5 meter threatened 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.520
 traffic safety 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.400
 could cause harm 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.020
 and property of others in 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.180
 the transport prosecutor's office considered that 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.080
 every flight even such a device should 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.090
 be agreed 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.860
 we decided to experiment first 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.119
 find out how the guards will respond 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.670
 on the appearance of the drone 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.140
 them in Krasnoyarsk and in the center of Moscow and 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.640
 where flights are at a height below eight 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.560
 kilometers are prohibited 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.450
 exception only for rescuers and 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.280
 top state officials how many times do you 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.250
 run once the police came 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.000
 to you i will be destruction some or husband 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.950
 be forbidden 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.710
 flight in the city let it literally 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.500
 several times ah copter from cops 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.869
 heed not copter flew in capable hands 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.970
 frisky but pliable here he is before us a 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.720
 after a second turns into black 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.060
 point in the sky 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.070
 thanks to the camcorder you can see 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.290
 bird's eye view of the city 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.049
 passers-by open their mouths with surprise 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.970
 watches as drone soars into the sky no one 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.670
 from the guards does not suit us 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.310
 change the platform and take off and even higher 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.010
 so means not 95 from 420 meters to 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.810
 communicate with protection for 20 meters 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.240
 takeoffs and landings could not stay 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.960
 unnoticed but nobody cares about us 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.590
 then we will try to be ahead of the game 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.600
 register several unmanned 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.730
 aircraft and get 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.040
 official permission to fly we want 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.630
 use airspace 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.190
 law for this we took all 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.750
 aircraft that were 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.950
 at the disposal of the squadron of emergency 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.770
 call hacker 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.210
 and a toy helicopter he also uses 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.790
 airspace we assign 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.920
 UAVs in the Rosaviation but do not have time 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.090
 go explain the problem as we 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.090
 immediately refused to register 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.200
 for silly little bear weave you 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.550
 if so watch 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.190
 and if you look 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:53.330
 Well , the quality of the start that he 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.730
 unmanned position find sales 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.440
 drone weighing more than 115 kilograms 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.480
 we probably did not succeed in talking about 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.740
 some very specific devices 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.630
 intended for example for 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.200
 professional aerial photography 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.700
 or even about the military themselves 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.900
 model aircraft recognize there is a relatively 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.940
 safe toys 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.710
 there are fast and powerful cars 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.180
 uncontrolled use of which 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.890
 can be very dangerous 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.630
 seemingly harmless flying 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.400
 battery propeller unit 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.720
 chips in total two and a half 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.920
 kilograms although flight performance 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.320
 impressive 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.330
 the top you can climb a kilometer yet 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.760
 five fly by plane and return 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.530
 back and easy to guess what will happen 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.660
 if in case of equipment failure or loss 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.490
 There is no connection such a quadcopter rub 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.980
 busy highway or pedestrian 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.050
 the zone turns out the ban is still needed 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.270
 that's just someone who did not understand 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.460
 Essentially outlawed flights of all without 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.410
 exception drones 1 norm led 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.600
 there are notions of a drone and 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.340
 the definition of such that under the drone 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.020
 gets even a balloon released 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.800
 girl in the park secondly for 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.510
 model airplanes 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.580
 and the drone rider is strictly 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.160
 permissive i think you understand what 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.590
 for thousands of boys who run 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.560
 model aircraft in parks in the meadows somewhere 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.970
 there still get permission for 5 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.209
 minute flight model aircraft 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.489
 it's almost impossible closed 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.980
 Circle run without permission supervisory 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.810
 authorities can not get permission 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.209
 you need to register the unit and 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.220
 you can only assign a huge number 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.410
 flying car weight with a moped 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.480
 it means they can fine anyone 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.400
 and owners of plastic toys and 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.680
 owners of devices capable of example 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.600
 rise above the skyscrapers of moscow city 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.290
 Oleg Baryshev Alexei Fedotov 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.290
 emergency call
