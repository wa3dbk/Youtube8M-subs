00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
packages to give me extra data but

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.900 
packages to give me extra data but
pretty<00:02:40.920> much<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.190> way<00:02:41.310> it<00:02:41.430> is<00:02:41.550> right<00:02:41.700> now<00:02:41.760> I

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
pretty much the way it is right now I

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.070 
pretty much the way it is right now I
don't<00:02:42.090> think<00:02:42.209> I'm<00:02:42.420> going<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:42.569> need<00:02:42.720> it<00:02:42.780> so<00:02:43.050> I

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.449 
happened last night and figure out
midnight<00:03:38.060> or<00:03:38.239> so<00:03:38.359> or<00:03:38.510> one<00:03:38.689> o'clock<00:03:38.780> and<00:03:39.560> I<00:03:40.220> was

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
midnight or so or one o'clock and I was

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.179 
midnight or so or one o'clock and I was
pretty<00:03:40.670> stoked<00:03:40.909> about<00:03:41.090> that<00:03:41.769> and<00:03:42.769> one<00:03:43.069> other

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:43.189 
pretty stoked about that and one other

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:45.129 
pretty stoked about that and one other
thing<00:03:43.489> I<00:03:43.579> didn't<00:03:43.790> want<00:03:43.819> to<00:03:44.000> bring<00:03:44.120> up<00:03:44.329> with<00:03:44.930> my

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139 
thing I didn't want to bring up with my

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:47.440 
thing I didn't want to bring up with my
mercy<00:03:45.590> video<00:03:45.859> that<00:03:46.010> I<00:03:46.040> posted<00:03:46.459> yesterday<00:03:46.609> the

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
mercy video that I posted yesterday the

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.479 
mercy video that I posted yesterday the
reason<00:03:47.870> that<00:03:47.989> nobody<00:03:48.379> could<00:03:48.889> watch<00:03:49.129> it<00:03:49.159> on

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
reason that nobody could watch it on

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:50.679 
reason that nobody could watch it on
their<00:03:49.669> phone<00:03:49.909> was<00:03:50.120> because<00:03:50.450> it<00:03:50.540> was<00:03:50.659> a

00:03:50.679 --> 00:03:50.689 
their phone was because it was a

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:53.619 
their phone was because it was a
copyrighted<00:03:51.319> song<00:03:51.349> and<00:03:52.280> I<00:03:52.489> guess<00:03:52.700> when<00:03:53.269> doing

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:53.629 
copyrighted song and I guess when doing

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:55.360 
copyrighted song and I guess when doing
that<00:03:53.780> you<00:03:53.930> can't<00:03:54.200> play<00:03:54.500> it<00:03:54.650> back<00:03:54.859> on<00:03:55.099> anything

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
that you can't play it back on anything

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.179 
that you can't play it back on anything
but<00:03:55.730> your<00:03:55.909> home<00:03:56.060> computer<00:03:56.299> so<00:03:56.840> that<00:03:57.139> was<00:03:57.859> the

00:03:58.179 --> 00:03:58.189 
but your home computer so that was the

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:00.280 
but your home computer so that was the
reason<00:03:58.579> why<00:03:58.760> that<00:03:59.120> it<00:03:59.659> wouldn't<00:03:59.989> let<00:04:00.049> you<00:04:00.260> play

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
reason why that it wouldn't let you play

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.379 
reason why that it wouldn't let you play
and<00:04:01.099> a<00:04:01.250> lot<00:04:01.489> of<00:04:01.609> people<00:04:01.819> weren't<00:04:01.970> happy<00:04:02.209> with

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:02.389 
and a lot of people weren't happy with

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:04.360 
and a lot of people weren't happy with
the<00:04:02.510> song<00:04:02.720> choice<00:04:03.109> and<00:04:03.319> stuff<00:04:03.500> like<00:04:03.620> that<00:04:03.799> so<00:04:03.829> I

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
the song choice and stuff like that so I

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.250 
the song choice and stuff like that so I
posted<00:04:05.060> on<00:04:05.180> the<00:04:05.269> Forza<00:04:05.569> forms<00:04:05.870> I<00:04:05.930> got<00:04:06.049> a<00:04:06.079> little

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
posted on the Forza forms I got a little

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.289 
posted on the Forza forms I got a little
bit<00:04:06.349> of<00:04:06.409> a<00:04:06.470> bad<00:04:06.650> feedback<00:04:07.040> on<00:04:07.280> it<00:04:07.459> it's<00:04:08.030> fine<00:04:08.269> I

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
bit of a bad feedback on it it's fine I

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.000 
bit of a bad feedback on it it's fine I
don't<00:04:08.569> really<00:04:08.870> care<00:04:09.139> to<00:04:09.319> be<00:04:09.349> honest<00:04:09.650> with<00:04:09.769> you

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
don't really care to be honest with you

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.640 
don't really care to be honest with you
I<00:04:10.549> had<00:04:11.030> the<00:04:11.180> most<00:04:11.359> thumbs<00:04:11.599> up<00:04:11.900> that<00:04:12.319> I've<00:04:12.440> had

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
I had the most thumbs up that I've had

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.849 
I had the most thumbs up that I've had
on<00:04:13.280> any<00:04:13.519> video<00:04:13.879> so<00:04:14.349> that<00:04:15.349> was<00:04:15.470> something<00:04:15.709> to

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:15.859 
on any video so that was something to

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:17.529 
on any video so that was something to
take<00:04:16.039> away<00:04:16.070> from<00:04:16.549> it<00:04:16.639> and<00:04:16.880> I<00:04:16.970> honestly<00:04:17.150> thought

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539 
take away from it and I honestly thought

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:18.969 
take away from it and I honestly thought
it<00:04:17.630> was<00:04:17.750> a<00:04:17.810> great<00:04:17.900> video<00:04:18.289> I<00:04:18.470> mean<00:04:18.650> there's<00:04:18.919> a

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
it was a great video I mean there's a

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:21.729 
it was a great video I mean there's a
lot<00:04:19.159> of<00:04:19.280> what<00:04:20.239> not<00:04:20.659> a<00:04:20.690> lot<00:04:20.870> of<00:04:20.900> editing<00:04:21.380> like<00:04:21.590> my

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
lot of what not a lot of editing like my

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.830 
lot of what not a lot of editing like my
top<00:04:22.039> editing<00:04:22.460> but<00:04:22.699> there's<00:04:23.180> some<00:04:23.449> creative

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
top editing but there's some creative

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.899 
top editing but there's some creative
things<00:04:24.050> in<00:04:24.260> there<00:04:24.440> so<00:04:24.710> I<00:04:24.740> was<00:04:25.039> pretty<00:04:25.220> safe

00:04:25.899 --> 00:04:25.909 
things in there so I was pretty safe

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:28.089 
things in there so I was pretty safe

one<00:05:18.690> two<00:05:19.220> so<00:05:21.020> pretty<00:05:22.020> much<00:05:22.110> I<00:05:22.260> guess

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
one two so pretty much I guess

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.990 
one two so pretty much I guess
everything<00:05:22.950> else<00:05:23.100> was<00:05:23.340> taken<00:05:23.700> for<00:05:23.850> whatever

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 
everything else was taken for whatever

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.659 
everything else was taken for whatever
reason<00:05:24.479> slap<00:05:24.720> train<00:05:24.930> was<00:05:25.080> taking<00:05:25.500> the<00:05:26.430> slap

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669 
reason slap train was taking the slap

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:28.520 
reason slap train was taking the slap
train<00:05:26.910> one<00:05:27.150> was<00:05:27.330> taking<00:05:27.750> so<00:05:27.960> I<00:05:27.990> have<00:05:28.260> to<00:05:28.380> use<00:05:28.500> a

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
train one was taking so I have to use a

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.950 
train one was taking so I have to use a
slap<00:05:28.860> train<00:05:29.130> 12<00:05:29.400> so<00:05:29.760> that's<00:05:30.330> my<00:05:30.660> twitch

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
slap train 12 so that's my twitch
