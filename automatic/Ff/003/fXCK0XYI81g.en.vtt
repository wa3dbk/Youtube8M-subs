00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.710 

hey<00:00:00.930> last<00:00:01.500> time<00:00:01.829> we<00:00:02.399> showed<00:00:02.429> you<00:00:02.970> what<00:00:03.689> the

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
hey last time we showed you what the

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.230 
hey last time we showed you what the
amplifier<00:00:04.350> sounds<00:00:04.859> like<00:00:05.069> today<00:00:05.549> we're<00:00:06.120> gonna

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
amplifier sounds like today we're gonna

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.660 
amplifier sounds like today we're gonna
make<00:00:06.480> a<00:00:06.540> profile<00:00:07.230> of<00:00:07.470> the<00:00:08.099> sound<00:00:08.370> of<00:00:08.550> the

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
make a profile of the sound of the

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.780 
make a profile of the sound of the
amplifier<00:00:09.269> so<00:00:10.019> you<00:00:10.110> can<00:00:10.380> compare<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:11.429> sound

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
amplifier so you can compare the sound

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.970 
amplifier so you can compare the sound
of<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.570> playthrough<00:00:13.170> that<00:00:13.410> I'm<00:00:13.650> gonna<00:00:13.799> do

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
of the playthrough that I'm gonna do

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.460 
of the playthrough that I'm gonna do
later<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.210> playthrough<00:00:15.870> in<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.260> last

later to the playthrough in the last
video<00:00:17.420> let's<00:00:18.420> go<00:00:21.769> so<00:00:22.769> here<00:00:23.010> we've<00:00:23.130> got<00:00:23.340> the

video let's go so here we've got the

00:00:23.670 --> 00:01:37.590 
video let's go so here we've got the
sound<00:00:24.359> in<00:00:24.630> solo<00:00:24.930> from<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.350> Kemper<00:00:25.769> again

amplifier and compare what you think are

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.240 
amplifier and compare what you think are
the<00:01:51.280> differences<00:01:51.820> in<00:01:52.060> the<00:01:52.840> next<00:01:53.140> video<00:01:53.320> we're

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
gonna do an AC 30 test and show you what

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.240 
gonna do an AC 30 test and show you what
kind<00:01:57.310> of<00:01:57.490> sounds<00:01:58.090> we<00:01:58.750> get<00:01:59.350> out<00:01:59.530> the<00:01:59.860> multi

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.090 
kind of sounds we get out the multi
miking<00:02:00.700> with<00:02:00.909> the<00:02:01.060> vintage<00:02:01.240> AC<00:02:01.570> 30<00:02:01.899> so<00:02:02.860> I'm

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
miking with the vintage AC 30 so I'm

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.479 
miking with the vintage AC 30 so I'm
looking<00:02:03.369> forward<00:02:03.580> to<00:02:03.729> that<00:02:03.820> one<00:02:04.000> bye
