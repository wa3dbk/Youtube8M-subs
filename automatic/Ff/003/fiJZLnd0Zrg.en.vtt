00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:13.249
 many years later sega again 

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:15.679
 decided to try myself in the genre earlier in 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:19.179
 year well from the very first frames it is clear that this 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:21.820
 that same old kind everyone played 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.019
 which we still remember on the slot machines 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.429
 for someone it is undoubted 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:28.969
 dignity for someone but a disadvantage 

00:00:28.969 --> 00:00:32.059
 the fact remains that this is exactly the race 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.320
 which we played many years ago 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.300
 of course she became completely new 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.150
 look appeared on gameplay deducing 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.080
 but essentially remained the same arcade physics 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.350
 also feelings of speed and unusual tracks 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.740
 if the developers had the task to save 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.740
 the spirit of the old series they managed the best 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.300
 as you may have already noticed the main 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.620
 graphic highlight game 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.190
 Shannon naturalistic 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.890
 mud 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.120
 who would have thought that it was liquid having 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.309
 just under the wheels 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.070
 can be so beautiful and 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.360
 fascinating 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.300
 here the developers have especially tried 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.200
 for the first time ever 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.150
 auto racing 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.650
 road surface under the wheels is not easy 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.590
 convention 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.600
 if you drive through the snow it is a Munoz padva tire and 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.730
 wheels if we drove to cross dirt be 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.320
 ready to see a real rut decoction 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.570
 Shah Pakhty above 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.080
 all this is so fascinating zor that 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.460
 you often forget the race and start 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.620
 experiment how much 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.880
 you can and offended ways and mud 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.900
 section potholes from the wheels 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.520
 with pieces of clay stick body hull 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.290
 the car looks almost realistic 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.740
 than slurry wheels 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.270
 especially liked the fact that if you 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.410
 watch out 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.080
 and show a little while in it someone 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.510
 there will slowly wash off the car 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.030
 you can easily arrange 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.160
 competition who quickly wash their 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.540
 the car 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.540
 you can take part in competitions 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.370
 in the network moisture in the ege have multiplayer 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:03.910
 supporting up to six people 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.410
 at the same time 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:06.660
 although if you do not have the opportunity 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.340
 compete with someone offline game can 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.910
 seem to you no longer so cheerful not 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.349
 carefree 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.430
 single player represents 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.429
 in fact, only one mode 

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:20.859
 here we are offered to ride a few 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:23.469
 championships each of which consists of 

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:26.469
 several smaller stages 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.290
 everything seems to sound good but when 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.400
 you start to play the process with each 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.849
 new track tires more and more 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.599
 programmers also tried here 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.109
 artificial intelligence 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:39.589
 who cheat calmly overtaking you 

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:41.199
 how could you not come off 

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:43.059
 and starts to tell pretty 

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:45.459
 a small number of various tracks 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.489
 but most importantly the whole championship you fight 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.579
 with non-cash opponents for 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:51.289
 ghostly awards 

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:53.459
 do not wait for the beautiful splash victorious 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.389
 podiums or at least three dimensional cups 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:58.489
 there is nothing of it 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.840
 flat two-dimensional less than 1 lettering and 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.120
 congratulations to all that did not stingy 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.269
 developers 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.370
 everything is as in the good old game 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.940
 automatons
