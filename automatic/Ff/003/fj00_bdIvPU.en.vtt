Attack it makes it able so it starts

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.480 
Attack it makes it able so it starts
stacking<00:02:43.770> up<00:02:44.480> like<00:02:45.480> I<00:02:46.040> don't<00:02:47.040> know<00:02:47.250> what<00:02:47.400> it

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
stacking up like I don't know what it

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.410 
stacking up like I don't know what it
really<00:02:47.790> like<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.600> exact<00:02:49.350> name<00:02:49.970> but<00:02:50.970> it<00:02:51.150> kind

okay so it's really nice during boss
battles<00:03:31.630> -<00:03:32.200> so<00:03:33.100> the<00:03:33.490> second<00:03:34.090> skill<00:03:34.240> is<00:03:34.300> dragons

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
battles - so the second skill is dragons

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.690 
battles - so the second skill is dragons
mic<00:03:34.989> so<00:03:35.230> this<00:03:35.410> is<00:03:35.560> pretty<00:03:35.709> much<00:03:35.860> as<00:03:36.190> the<00:03:36.520> same

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
mic so this is pretty much as the same

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.490 
mic so this is pretty much as the same
concept<00:03:37.209> as<00:03:37.300> the<00:03:37.330> first<00:03:37.660> skill<00:03:37.959> but<00:03:38.110> this<00:03:38.260> time

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
concept as the first skill but this time

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.690 
concept as the first skill but this time
they<00:03:38.650> just<00:03:38.680> have<00:03:38.950> the<00:03:39.040> chance<00:03:39.250> to<00:03:39.340> stun<00:03:39.580> your

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
they just have the chance to stun your

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.340 
they just have the chance to stun your
opponent<00:03:40.090> for<00:03:40.180> two<00:03:40.450> seconds<00:03:41.190> and<00:03:42.660> the<00:03:43.660> stun<00:03:43.989> I

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
opponent for two seconds and the stun I

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.430 
opponent for two seconds and the stun I
mean<00:03:44.920> this<00:03:45.550> is<00:03:45.760> an<00:03:45.910> okay<00:03:46.239> skill<00:03:46.569> for<00:03:46.780> PvP<00:03:47.290> and

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
mean this is an okay skill for PvP and

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.430 
mean this is an okay skill for PvP and
stuff<00:03:47.709> don't<00:03:48.069> rely<00:03:48.400> on<00:03:48.430> it<00:03:48.670> too<00:03:49.030> much<00:03:49.060> I<00:03:49.630> would

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
stuff don't rely on it too much I would

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.229 
stuff don't rely on it too much I would
prefer<00:03:50.620> to<00:03:50.830> rely<00:03:51.220> on<00:03:51.250> the<00:03:51.489> first<00:03:51.730> skill<00:03:52.030> way

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
prefer to rely on the first skill way

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.600 
prefer to rely on the first skill way
more<00:03:52.540> often<00:03:52.959> get<00:03:53.110> this<00:03:53.230> go<00:03:53.560> you<00:03:53.709> know<00:03:53.860> myzel

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
more often get this go you know myzel

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:55.860 
more often get this go you know myzel
there's<00:03:54.850> always<00:03:55.030> those<00:03:55.209> times<00:03:55.269> where<00:03:55.660> you<00:03:55.690> get

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
there's always those times where you get

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.150 
there's always those times where you get
lucky<00:03:56.230> or<00:03:56.769> the<00:03:57.100> game-changer<00:03:58.590> okay<00:03:59.590> so<00:03:59.650> third

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
lucky or the game-changer okay so third

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.240 
lucky or the game-changer okay so third
scale<00:04:00.430> is<00:04:00.640> sword<00:04:01.060> placed<00:04:01.530> it<00:04:02.530> deals<00:04:02.890> light

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
scale is sword placed it deals light

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.430 
scale is sword placed it deals light
damage<00:04:03.940> and<00:04:04.209> reduces<00:04:04.900> your<00:04:05.019> opponent's

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
damage and reduces your opponent's

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.670 
damage and reduces your opponent's
chance<00:04:05.650> to<00:04:05.920> hit<00:04:06.130> with<00:04:06.670> massless<00:04:07.150> or<00:04:07.390> play<00:04:07.680> so

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
chance to hit with massless or play so

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.530 
chance to hit with massless or play so
pretty<00:04:09.310> much<00:04:09.459> you<00:04:09.610> do<00:04:09.730> a<00:04:09.760> light<00:04:10.030> damage<00:04:10.239> and

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
pretty much you do a light damage and

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.780 
pretty much you do a light damage and
reduce<00:04:10.660> your<00:04:10.959> opponent's<00:04:11.470> chick<00:04:11.739> like<00:04:12.459> chance

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
reduce your opponent's chick like chance

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.930 
reduce your opponent's chick like chance
to<00:04:13.000> hit<00:04:13.180> so<00:04:13.450> hit<00:04:13.630> chance<00:04:13.959> and<00:04:14.459> also<00:04:15.459> I<00:04:15.700> believe

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
to hit so hit chance and also I believe

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.330 
to hit so hit chance and also I believe
it<00:04:16.389> reduces<00:04:16.840> damage<00:04:17.139> for<00:04:17.709> a<00:04:17.739> certain<00:04:18.100> amount

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
it reduces damage for a certain amount

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:24.030 
it reduces damage for a certain amount
of<00:04:18.519> time<00:04:18.840> if<00:04:19.840> you<00:04:20.350> make<00:04:20.560> them<00:04:20.680> unarmed<00:04:22.710> so<00:04:23.710> yeah

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
of time if you make them unarmed so yeah

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.270 
of time if you make them unarmed so yeah
pretty<00:04:24.669> decent<00:04:25.270> skill<00:04:25.630> you<00:04:26.410> you<00:04:26.770> really<00:04:26.950> want

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
pretty decent skill you you really want

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.550 
pretty decent skill you you really want
to<00:04:27.340> keep<00:04:27.729> using<00:04:28.000> it<00:04:28.300> so<00:04:28.720> yeah<00:04:28.930> I<00:04:28.990> got<00:04:29.140> disarmed

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
to keep using it so yeah I got disarmed

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.659 
to keep using it so yeah I got disarmed
now<00:04:29.740> I<00:04:30.240> believe<00:04:31.240> a<00:04:31.270> mixed<00:04:31.690> herd<00:04:31.780> a<00:04:31.960> much<00:04:32.169> lower

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
now I believe a mixed herd a much lower

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.120 
now I believe a mixed herd a much lower
so<00:04:33.840> using<00:04:34.840> this<00:04:34.960> class<00:04:35.200> you<00:04:35.470> really<00:04:35.710> want

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
so using this class you really want

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.700 
so using this class you really want
that's<00:04:36.520> go<00:04:36.880> to<00:04:36.940> do<00:04:37.210> really<00:04:37.720> active<00:04:38.200> really

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
that's go to do really active really

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.290 
that's go to do really active really
active<00:04:39.190> and<00:04:39.400> just<00:04:39.640> there<00:04:39.910> in<00:04:40.180> the<00:04:40.210> background

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
active and just there in the background

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.400 
active and just there in the background
so<00:04:40.930> make<00:04:41.110> sure<00:04:41.140> it's<00:04:41.410> usually<00:04:41.590> on<00:04:43.200> all<00:04:44.200> right

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
so make sure it's usually on all right
