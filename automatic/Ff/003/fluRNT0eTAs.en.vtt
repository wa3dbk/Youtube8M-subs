00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.180
 today I will read holy terror free 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.470
 terror then that's the version in 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.760
 language s is the french version 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.010
 is called center to the ear and that's 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.309
 exactly the same format I prove it 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.710
 this nothing even surpasses format to 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.390
 the Italian like 300 and except that it's 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.770
 a graphic novel that it was 300 were 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.760
 released in several issues 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.340
 before and then recovery had made it a 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.810
 beautiful book so that's it appeared in 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.880
 legendary you know those who make 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.010
 legendary films I believe the last 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.500
 batman was produced by legendary and and 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.500
 the 300 to who was wronged telly jean 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.790
 memory gabriel and that's the 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.210
 French version translated terror 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.800
 holy 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.329
 so it's a book that made 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.520
 controversial when he went out to the states 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.930
 united because years of advanced ask if 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.719
 frank miller still had something 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.760
 to say if he still knew how to draw and if 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.640
 he was a little racist about the 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.809
 edges so what am I going to do by 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.420
 points does it have anything to 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.829
 to say I think so I think it is 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.760
 in any case he has a great cry of 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.110
 mouth pushed her breasts that a post 30 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.400
 September have to know that Americans 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.600
 were traumatized anyway talked about in 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.040
 September they are not used to 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.420
 have them attack they usually 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.869
 to attack but not to be attacked 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.420
 and you have to have enough vision 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.130
 American is quite manichean for 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.420
 for to make a book like that I 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.790
 not justify at all what he did or 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:25.229
 not I'm just saying that's graphically 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:27.540
 I find it very beautiful I think that there 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.680
 where in sin city play especially on the 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.409
 shadows from there and I find that he plays 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.720
 especially on the job and on the tasks 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.780
 of ink see there really is everywhere 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.560
 there is a dirty side but it is wanted 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.560
 there is movement 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.420
 here it is still hyper control 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.610
 what I mean those who say that 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.810
 frank miller and can not draw but 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.610
 who take their crayola and we will see 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.650
 because it's still amazing 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.090
 so the story is what's a 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.440
 kind of batman because she spent 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.720
 this project is a batman who is not 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.650
 never left 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.840
 so he is to create a character who 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.060
 is called fixes or fixer the 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.590
 fixers he will fight the terrorists 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.920
 it's really basic 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.020
 these Americans then the first to 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.710
 first degree we will see america 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.119
 against the Arabs 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.130
 it is true that at this moment it is 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.800
 bath is tendentious to talk about this 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.739
 kind of things it puts oil on 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.180
 the fire in the second degree we see there 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.750
 finally sees what all 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.790
 Super hero 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.070
 the superheroes run after the bad guys 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.630
 and the bad guys cdc big bad guys 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.850
 they kill everyone 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.380
 so that's what ultimately is 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.040
 that finally there is a difference 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.080
 between the dictators they and magneto and 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.940
 fatalistic what there is a difference in 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.480
 here we have to push the reflection 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.280
 little i think 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.350
 and when a simple thought blow when 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.060
 we say okay good me frank miller is 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.760
 still an old conservative 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.980
 american little nerdy good 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.629
 he had a speech a little easier a little 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.530
 first degree from time to time yeah 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:51.189
 but behind and still a 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.530
 reflection to have 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:55.299
 and it's mostly a reading for himself 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.250
 to make an opinion yourself and I think that 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.299
 well you'll be smart enough to 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.250
 you do it here is her sister at 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:02.349
 delcourt is in any case I find that 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.180
 it is to read and then I propose that we 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.920
 discusses the limit by the years in the 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.440
 comments and tell me what you are saying 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.450
 have thought because it's a bit easy 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.420
 to say I like I do not like miller is a 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:16.030
 facho I think there are other things 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.230
 to say and there are certainly others 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.540
 things to pull from this comic 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.579
 because there are a lot of good 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.980
 things in here I do not justify 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:26.470
 these words again but never 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.579
 open the debate because do not close 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.579
 the door very quickly
