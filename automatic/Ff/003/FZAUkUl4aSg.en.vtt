00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250 
the plane this is a very tricky spot I

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.860 
the plane this is a very tricky spot I
believe<00:00:42.609> I<00:00:42.820> was<00:00:43.000> lucky<00:00:43.329> enough<00:00:43.359> to<00:00:43.629> get<00:00:43.719> on<00:00:43.839> my

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.069 
believe I was lucky enough to get on my
third<00:00:44.140> try<00:00:44.440> and<00:00:45.539> except<00:00:46.539> once<00:00:46.749> you<00:00:46.839> get<00:00:46.989> the

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 
third try and except once you get the

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.450 
third try and except once you get the
hang<00:00:47.109> of<00:00:47.379> it<00:00:47.499> you'll<00:00:48.399> be<00:00:49.210> amazing<00:00:50.199> at<00:00:50.350> it<00:00:50.379> and<00:00:50.589> I

hang of it you'll be amazing at it and I

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.079 
hang of it you'll be amazing at it and I
mean<00:00:51.909> the<00:00:52.300> maps<00:00:52.539> just<00:00:52.870> came<00:00:53.050> out<00:00:53.230> today<00:00:53.379> so<00:00:53.530> no

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:54.089

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
for some reason the easiest part of this

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.380 
for some reason the easiest part of this
spot<00:01:00.789> was<00:01:01.530> took<00:01:02.530> me<00:01:02.769> the<00:01:02.829> longest<00:01:03.360> but<00:01:04.360> I

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
spot was took me the longest but I

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.840 
spot was took me the longest but I
finally<00:01:05.080> got<00:01:05.170> up<00:01:05.320> and<00:01:05.440> I<00:01:05.950> am<00:01:06.130> on<00:01:06.340> top<00:01:06.520> of<00:01:06.580> plane

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
finally got up and I am on top of plane

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.700 
finally got up and I am on top of plane
and<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:08.650> is<00:01:08.830> a<00:01:09.210> great<00:01:10.210> spot<00:01:10.570> for<00:01:10.630> trick<00:01:11.440> shots

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
and this is a great spot for trick shots

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.700 
and this is a great spot for trick shots
like<00:01:12.100> people<00:01:12.760> used<00:01:12.970> to<00:01:13.090> and<00:01:13.600> what's<00:01:14.470> cool
