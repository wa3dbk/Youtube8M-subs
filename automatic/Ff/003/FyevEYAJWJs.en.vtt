really<00:02:00.899> have<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:01.380> problem<00:02:01.740> whatsoever<00:02:02.159> now

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
really have that problem whatsoever now

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.910 
really have that problem whatsoever now

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
apparently this app is only available to

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.950 
apparently this app is only available to
users<00:02:05.159> who<00:02:05.310> live<00:02:05.729> in<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.060> United<00:02:06.450> States<00:02:06.689> and

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.100 
isn't available anywhere else now I'm
sure<00:02:09.119> this<00:02:09.330> will<00:02:09.390> change<00:02:09.629> in<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.869> near<00:02:10.050> future

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
sure this will change in the near future

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.229 
sure this will change in the near future
but<00:02:10.950> it's<00:02:11.009> definitely<00:02:11.280> disappointing<00:02:12.060> for

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
but it's definitely disappointing for

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.350 
but it's definitely disappointing for
all<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.480> people<00:02:12.660> who<00:02:12.810> don't

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
all the people who don't

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.910 
all the people who don't
the<00:02:13.480> United<00:02:13.810> States<00:02:14.050> and<00:02:14.290> something<00:02:14.650> else<00:02:14.740> i

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
the United States and something else i

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.590 
the United States and something else i
also<00:02:15.070> noticed<00:02:15.400> about<00:02:15.730> this<00:02:15.940> app<00:02:16.180> is<00:02:16.390> that

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
also noticed about this app is that

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.240 
also noticed about this app is that
there<00:02:16.810> was<00:02:16.900> no<00:02:17.020> chat<00:02:17.350> feature<00:02:17.650> when<00:02:17.950> I<00:02:17.980> went<00:02:18.190> to

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
there was no chat feature when I went to

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.860 
there was no chat feature when I went to
the<00:02:18.370> streams<00:02:18.700> like<00:02:19.060> normally<00:02:19.450> you<00:02:19.570> go<00:02:19.690> on<00:02:19.780> the

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
the streams like normally you go on the

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.020 
the streams like normally you go on the
computer<00:02:19.990> and<00:02:20.440> you<00:02:20.950> have<00:02:21.100> the<00:02:21.310> option<00:02:21.490> to<00:02:21.730> chat

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
computer and you have the option to chat

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.940 
computer and you have the option to chat
with<00:02:22.060> other<00:02:22.240> users<00:02:22.540> and<00:02:22.900> login<00:02:23.260> now<00:02:23.680> I<00:02:23.710> think

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
with other users and login now I think

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.200 
with other users and login now I think
this<00:02:24.070> would<00:02:24.250> be<00:02:24.280> a<00:02:24.370> really<00:02:24.430> cool<00:02:24.790> feature<00:02:24.940> to

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
this would be a really cool feature to

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.600 
this would be a really cool feature to
add<00:02:25.240> on<00:02:25.660> to<00:02:25.960> this<00:02:26.080> Xbox<00:02:26.560> app<00:02:26.800> if<00:02:26.980> possible

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.060

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
especially because Xbox makes a chat pad
