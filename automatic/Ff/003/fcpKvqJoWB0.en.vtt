 and now thanks to this little 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.149
 extent that the chain begins to take 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.070
 I managed to find some 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.440
 partnerships that will allow us to 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.090
 do you test videos accessories 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.379
 short now that everything is said 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.289
 let's start with the first question 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.660
 erwan bernard question what software 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.550
 do you make video editing and what 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.710
 computer to above then I was doing the 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.270
 video editing on sony vegas pro when 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.949
 I only used my pc which is a 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.480
 laptop samsung 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.309
 but now that I have my macmini 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.750
 I use rather final cut pro they 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.680
 are all accessories and which ones 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.530
 useful on the most 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.970
 then my accessories here they are yes I 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.130

 wrist when going underwater I 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.330

 you're watching this video the 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.170
 presentation has already been made then 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.390
 click here and finally I have a little 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.260
 storage suitcase that I took on the 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.210
 onboard camera or so now 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.280
 let's see what accessories I use 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.870
 the most I use mainly the 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.060
 additional batteries the bindings 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.100
 for the tripods the clamp to fix the 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.440
 gopro a little bit everywhere the screws of 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.970
 tightening the protective lens and the 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.310
 dual charger when I'm in 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.320
 trip to and now I'm going to use 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.270
 also very often the suitcase of 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.430
 storage of course ah and then also 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.770
 before I used the boom often but 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.630
 I did a little corner europa park and 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.790
 so it's a bit broken in 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.790
 an exploded state and I have to 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.880
 find another question next 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:18.090
 still roles Bernot for which 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.250
 sport or activities you use your gopro 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.140
 so I use for a lot 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.550
 different activities as soon as I go 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.260
 have fun just take it 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.030
 I'm going to bathe stand up 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.320
 paddle the fate of skiing make me the 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.330
 hiking or anything else 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.010
 I take it so I do not use 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.019
 all the time so I confess that 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.459
 I use a little bit everywhere in all 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.530
 the weather in the rain under the cold 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.280
 in the heat here I use all the 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.720
 time 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.330
 question number four questions from 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.489
 laurent there is there a solution for that 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.440
 the remote control is always connected to 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.060
 the gopro yes but we must leave the 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.010
 otago proal wifi but this is it 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.570
 will use a lot of battery do 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.670
 a little test I connect my 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.989
 remote control to my go pro throws a nest 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.310
 pro using the remote control 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.760
 the remote is so like a boo 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.769
 are safe 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.750
 we can see that the GoPro it to 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:04.239
 help with wifi is always 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.310
 on, so I turn on my remote 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.709
 is still pressing the button 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.150
 mode the gopro turns on so you can 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.250
 see that even turning off the gopro 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.260
 with the remote control it can be turned on again 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.370
 with this one the problem is that 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.109
 as I told you the battery is going 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.910
 many be used and so you 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.789
 can not - movie is next question 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:24.190
 asked by mathieu pÃ¢quis how to add 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:26.380
 do not gps traces to the video so I 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.000
 searched a lot sought but I believe 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.990
 that the only solution is to add it 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.870
 to video editing 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.970
 I 'm sorry victor scalise why as 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.680
 you wanted to make videos and who is your 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.780
 model so I started doing some 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.979
 videos in 2012 on iphone all this 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.510
 who was touching the jailbreak 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:41.770
 in fact I did that simply because 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.479
 that I saw that a lot of people 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.460
 were struggling with this jailbreak 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:46.570
 and then little by little I started 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.919
 to make humor in my videos 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.810
 until downright created my channel 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:51.550
 humorous and now I have a 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.600
 channel dedicated to the gopro for the same 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.100
 reason only for the iphone 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.289
 I saw that many people had 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.160
 wrong with this little device and so I'm 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:59.410
 am told that still not a lot 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.150
 to be for them I have mm who is my 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.740
 model well myself I am very 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.150
 proud of this channel because I think 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.530
 have found a nice way to 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.880
 do some tutorials I got 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.930
 just said I was tired of 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.729
 watch tutorials where everyone 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.710
 wanted to sleep while listening then 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:14.440
 I wanted to reinvigorate all that nicolas 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.570
 busto jean couple 03 more but will they 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.020
 buy a rybak battery or boat 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.060
 Easter 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.919
 I would be canvas would rather throw a 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.080
 normal battery I find that it holds 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:24.610
 longer one of self nat 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.160
 how do you cut videos 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.990
 on gopro studio 2.0 then worry 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.789
 it's not complicated at all you 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.949
 places where you want the cut and and in 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:35.410
 bottom left you have a little razor and you 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:37.389
 click on the magic the video is 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.520
 cut in two jobs early beret how 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:40.960
 have a more professional rendering to 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.639
 through software and corrections 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.930
 colorimetric etc. 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:46.360
 the software that I will advise you this 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:49.030
 would be final that you 're sony vegas 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.889
 pro be first pro and in addition 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.050
 of one of three used after effects 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:54.789
 you can use lenses like 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.480
 mine that is polarizing for example 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:58.250
 and for everything that is retouching 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.900
 you can use one of the software 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.330
 that I quoted you before is 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.770
 also used after effects for example 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.990
 I made a video to show how 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:08.090
 use pro tune mode on final cut 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.950
 pro finally well how to correct some 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.360
 protein colors on final cut pro 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.470
 so you click on the small image that 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.230
 is displayed and you will see the video 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:17.120
 directly and you 'll be doing it always 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:19.580
 the same person whose how stabilized 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.680
 at most his videos using a 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.660
 stabilizer also called steadicam 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.850
 I made a video there too the sus 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.350
 presentation on mine you click 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:29.000
 on it to get a glimpse of this 

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:31.100
 that it can still give the same 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.300
 no one evaluates so how well 

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.550
 use burst mode 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.380
 I will advise you to use 30 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.240
 images for two seconds that's what 

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.680
 allows you to have almost all the 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.390
 time the photo you want to keep 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.890
