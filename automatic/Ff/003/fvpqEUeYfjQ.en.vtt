00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.360
 Today we are going to talk about it here. 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.410
 The 3rd Swamp Monster Collection 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.030
 that the pane is bringing the already departed 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.490
 three volumes the fourth volume is 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.460
 painting around 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:25.710
 I aptly panini decided to take 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:28.050
 phase throughout the plant not only younger 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.539
 definitive work of the character as 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.180
 one of the best jobs carlos has done already 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.200
 He did and everything he does everything the wheel 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.050
 What he does is a fuck 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.739
 I'm sorry, the Rector will take 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.329
 in you're not you understand others 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.670
 good beauty people but the rectors 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.160
 Sorry you, but everything she lasts does 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.750
 it's fuck and above average and one of his squad 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.530
 is among the most fucking things he 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.800
 already did 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.750
 and I remember fucking the ship when 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.719
 April started throwing it from there in the 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.399
 View New Content 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.789
 then went through super friends on a 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.260
 special edition and super power and then 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.350
 from lunch to attend own magazine 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.720
 I was kid every type 12 13 years of 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.040
 age and was used to some readings 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.049
 a little more final 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.750
 Then suddenly I begin to read a lesson. 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:20.100
 Swamp Monster Anatomy the 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.619
 first bow whore that gave birth to him there 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.380
 comes his saga with ethics comes the saga 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.860
 him with the arcane after hell to 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.390
 his relation with inb and then the gothic 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.610
 American Gothic ends when 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.170
 Americans and French that this guy is going 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.299
 do because he did something so 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.950
 sensational does not even know a game 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.060
 constant and with the recovery of all 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:45.210
 the vampire legends werewolves a beast 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.280
 witchcraft and fucking and then he makes a 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.790
 with external sales crises 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.460
 spectacular re-creates the world that I said 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.250
 now and now it brings all that a 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.500
 plot fucking intimate fucking leads to people 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.260
 the gotham city then takes the amazement at 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.710
 space 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:07.850
 Luca maybe this guy is crazy so 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.690
 us is a work that has no ups and 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.440
 low 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:15.200
 and it 's a linear work it starts there in the 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.230
 stalk and she goes away 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.880
 She's leaving and it's amazing. 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.340
 page after page 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.990
 the love for him was still several 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.600
 things he experienced at HQs 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.030
 in my English I recommend the things that 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.640
 made 26 here was already safe 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.490
 enough to apply it subverts the 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.660
 narrative at various times has text 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.970
 so damn 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.710
 but to be fucking text and never in 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.870
 nowhere is it boring 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.700
 never at any moment abandonment 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.130
 falling over the egg that sucks 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:51.380
 and then you have studio art emme 7 and 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:53.450
 that of yesterday that even starts in a 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.270
 a little hesitant 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.790
 but if they get a way and thus not 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:03.650
 would not have better artists for 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:06.140
 have done this work as the 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.470
 faces are many sinister are many 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:12.530
 accidents and for me they make the 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.810
 Definitely the young man swamp with all 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.440
 those expenses is that notifications and 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.590
 such 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.130
 But there are too many of the things that 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.750
 are coming out today that what the 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:27.320
 current monster keys keys olé 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.989
 that the current scriptwriter has been trying to 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:33.590
 parliament type of trees and 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.820
 such is the presence of air cani came 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.370
 from behind 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:40.700
 everything was created by namur only 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.709
 nobody nobody spider the request asks that 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:47.180
 he did the concepts that the guy brought 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:49.670
 were very very cool of the action tour 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:56.000
 here are some of the images 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:04:01.030
 we did was really of a kitten 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.739
 menstrue horror inside dc comics 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:07.040
 some supposedly impossible to be 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:08.930
 done today there was no vertigo line 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.630
 maybe today within the pet line that you 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.830
 get to do lots of people did more 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.990
 he did 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:20.750
 at that time it did not exist inside 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:22.580
 buguinha of bag is it just me 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.080
 I do not know can not find the held 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.740
 enough to tell you how much this is 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.940
 Good fuck was stung by April. 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.680
 many ways 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:35.840
 then other publishers will try to relaunch 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.850
 the pixel arrived there only are hardcover 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.750
 nice but did not go forward left I am 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.660
 the number one 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.220
 the panini is throwing people here at 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.720
 less sure that it will end 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.660
 it will be complete 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.740
 if the pane is cast as it is 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.500
 should 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:54.760
 and I do not know, I do not know why I 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.750
 I would very much like to have this in hardcover 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.150
 complete hardcover as you 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:02.600
 criticizes for example with the cast paper 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:05.030
 is on the other hand makes it accessible to 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.850
 several other people who may not 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.440
 would have been able to buy the cover 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:13.940
 Hard Complete Collection in Hardcover 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:16.520
 so it's always a risky move, right? 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:19.240
 critical or roasted 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:22.250
 Anyway, the card is now gone and 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.770
 nothing prevents in the future precisely 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.780
 they face everything in two or even three 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.120
 hardcover editions do not know maybe and 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.280
 maybe even that is the plan of 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.650
 in any way the same format as the 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.690
 constant in replay replay live out 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:38.000
 neither left source then is being 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:40.550
 hell now plays movies and a 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.390
 format that is not ideal for your 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:47.720
 format that pleases me and when 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:50.330
 It's going to end up pretty cute on the shelf. 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:53.060
 grandson, nice little there, cute 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:56.270

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:58.850
 beautiful thing there's no way I can emphasize 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:03.290
 more for you guys, if you do not 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:06.860
