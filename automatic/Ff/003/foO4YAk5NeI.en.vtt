00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
be pretty easy and flash catalyst to do

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.950 
be pretty easy and flash catalyst to do
the<00:01:31.729> rotation<00:01:32.729> but<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.509> order<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.720> do<00:01:33.810> the

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
the rotation but in order to do the

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.510 
the rotation but in order to do the
translation<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.860> actually<00:01:35.189> moving<00:01:35.369> the

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
translation that actually moving the

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.370 
translation that actually moving the
pieces<00:01:35.640> into<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.000> position<00:01:36.540> you're<00:01:37.140> going<00:01:37.200> to

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
pieces into the position you're going to

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.510 
pieces into the position you're going to
need<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.560> bring<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:37.890> into<00:01:38.130> flash<00:01:38.340> builder

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
need to bring that into flash builder

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.120 
need to bring that into flash builder
code<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.360> flash<00:01:40.229> catalyst<00:01:40.590> beta<00:01:40.829> right<00:01:41.040> now

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
code that flash catalyst beta right now

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.800 
code that flash catalyst beta right now
doesn't<00:01:41.310> have<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.610> ability<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:41.909> do<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.090> 3d<00:01:42.509> move

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
doesn't have the ability to do a 3d move

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.859 
doesn't have the ability to do a 3d move
so<00:01:42.990> we'll<00:01:43.110> do<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.380> in<00:01:43.439> flash<00:01:44.070> builder<00:01:44.340> so

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
so we'll do that in flash builder so

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:46.910 
so we'll do that in flash builder so
hopefully<00:01:45.869> in<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.020> next<00:01:46.200> version<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:46.740> flash

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
hopefully in the next version of flash

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.730 
hopefully in the next version of flash
calves<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.369> 3d<00:01:47.820> move<00:01:48.540> 3d<00:01:48.869> function<00:01:49.560> will<00:01:49.710> be

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
calves that 3d move 3d function will be

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.289 
calves that 3d move 3d function will be
implemented<00:01:50.159> but<00:01:50.340> for<00:01:50.579> now<00:01:50.700> it's<00:01:50.880> not<00:01:51.030> so

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
implemented but for now it's not so

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.200 
implemented but for now it's not so
let's<00:01:52.020> get<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.430> so<00:01:53.430> I'm<00:01:53.520> in<00:01:53.640> flash<00:01:53.850> catalyst

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
let's get to it so I'm in flash catalyst

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.340 
let's get to it so I'm in flash catalyst
right<00:01:54.360> now<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.659> this<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.049> finished

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
right now and this is the finished

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.840 
right now and this is the finished
product<00:01:55.710> let's<00:01:55.890> go<00:01:55.979> ahead<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.189> create<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.670> new

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
product let's go ahead and create a new

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.580 
product let's go ahead and create a new
project<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.479> how<00:01:57.570> this<00:01:57.659> is<00:01:57.719> done<00:01:57.990> let's

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
project that you how this is done let's

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.710 
project that you how this is done let's
go<00:01:58.740> file<00:01:59.040> new<00:02:01.880> project

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
go file new project

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.440 
go file new project
and<00:02:05.760> we'll<00:02:06.760> go<00:02:06.820> ahead<00:02:06.880> and<00:02:06.970> save<00:02:07.120> this<00:02:07.150> yes<00:02:07.590> and

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
and we'll go ahead and save this yes and

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.590 
and we'll go ahead and save this yes and
we'll<00:02:10.450> stick<00:02:10.810> with<00:02:10.840> 800<00:02:11.320> x<00:02:11.380> 600<00:02:11.680> hit<00:02:12.010> ok<00:02:12.310> and

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
we'll stick with 800 x 600 hit ok and

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.030 
we'll stick with 800 x 600 hit ok and

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
so if I open up the folder James

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.710 
so if I open up the folder James
creatives<00:02:29.080> in<00:02:29.170> work<00:02:29.440> folder<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:31.180> that<00:02:31.540> work

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
creatives in work folder and that work

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.390 
creatives in work folder and that work
forward<00:02:32.050> is<00:02:32.140> all<00:02:32.290> of<00:02:32.410> James's<00:02:32.770> Photoshop<00:02:33.190> work

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
forward is all of James's Photoshop work

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.910 
forward is all of James's Photoshop work
and<00:02:33.700> there's<00:02:33.850> the<00:02:34.170> five<00:02:35.170> pieces<00:02:35.470> own<00:02:35.710> weather

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
and there's the five pieces own weather

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.510 
and there's the five pieces own weather
need<00:02:36.130> back<00:02:36.490> ceiling<00:02:37.120> floor<00:02:38.220> right<00:02:39.220> and<00:02:39.459> left

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
need back ceiling floor right and left

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.610 
need back ceiling floor right and left
so<00:02:40.330> let's<00:02:40.870> pull<00:02:41.290> that<00:02:41.470> out<00:02:42.720> quickly<00:02:43.720> and<00:02:44.020> all

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
so let's pull that out quickly and all

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.930 
so let's pull that out quickly and all
we<00:02:44.709> have<00:02:44.800> to<00:02:44.890> do<00:02:44.980> now<00:02:45.010> is<00:02:45.160> just<00:02:45.280> import<00:02:45.760> those

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
we have to do now is just import those

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.270 
we have to do now is just import those
images<00:02:46.270> lay<00:02:46.600> them<00:02:46.810> on<00:02:46.900> top<00:02:46.959> of<00:02:47.230> each<00:02:47.530> other<00:02:47.740> in

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
images lay them on top of each other in

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.150 
images lay them on top of each other in
flash<00:02:49.209> catalyst<00:02:49.870> and<00:02:50.080> then<00:02:50.530> rotate<00:02:50.950> them<00:02:51.130> to

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
flash catalyst and then rotate them to

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.830 
flash catalyst and then rotate them to
the<00:02:51.340> correct<00:02:51.610> positions<00:02:52.090> then<00:02:52.570> we'll<00:02:52.720> bring

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
the correct positions then we'll bring

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.300 
the correct positions then we'll bring
that<00:02:52.990> in<00:02:53.110> a<00:02:53.170> flash<00:02:53.410> builder<00:02:53.680> and<00:02:54.070> we'll

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
that in a flash builder and we'll

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.580 
that in a flash builder and we'll
actually<00:02:54.550> finish<00:02:55.360> everything<00:02:55.630> up<00:02:55.840> so<00:02:56.530> let's

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
actually finish everything up so let's

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:57.870 
actually finish everything up so let's
start<00:02:56.800> importing<00:02:57.070> so<00:02:57.430> I<00:02:57.459> just<00:02:57.670> bring<00:02:57.760> the

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
start importing so I just bring the

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.710 
start importing so I just bring the
first<00:02:58.060> image<00:02:58.300> in<00:02:58.480> and<00:02:58.690> just<00:02:59.530> do<00:02:59.650> it<00:02:59.740> import<00:03:00.100> and

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
first image in and just do it import and

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.470 
first image in and just do it import and
go<00:03:01.720> right<00:03:01.900> to<00:03:01.930> James's<00:03:02.320> work<00:03:02.500> folder<00:03:03.360> here<00:03:04.360> we

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480

that<00:03:14.830> that<00:03:14.860> image<00:03:15.250> has<00:03:15.400> been<00:03:15.430> mipmap<00:03:15.850> it's<00:03:16.180> a

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
that that image has been mipmap it's a

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.600 
that that image has been mipmap it's a
512<00:03:16.780> by<00:03:16.930> 512<00:03:17.200> now<00:03:18.070> I'm<00:03:18.160> just<00:03:18.250> going<00:03:18.340> to<00:03:18.459> put<00:03:18.580> it

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
512 by 512 now I'm just going to put it

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.370 
512 by 512 now I'm just going to put it
on<00:03:18.700> the<00:03:18.820> stage<00:03:19.030> anywhere<00:03:19.420> I'm<00:03:19.510> just<00:03:19.660> put<00:03:19.780> 1<00:03:19.989> 50

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
on the stage anywhere I'm just put 1 50

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.449 
on the stage anywhere I'm just put 1 50
by<00:03:21.510> 50<00:03:22.510> so<00:03:23.260> i<00:03:23.290> can<00:03:23.470> just<00:03:23.560> overlap<00:03:23.980> all<00:03:24.190> the

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
by 50 so i can just overlap all the

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.030 
by 50 so i can just overlap all the
other<00:03:24.610> five<00:03:25.390> images<00:03:25.739> it<00:03:26.739> doesn't<00:03:26.980> matter

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
other five images it doesn't matter

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.930 
other five images it doesn't matter
where<00:03:27.250> i<00:03:27.280> put<00:03:27.400> them<00:03:27.519> across<00:03:27.580> I'm<00:03:27.760> gonna<00:03:27.880> turn

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
where i put them across I'm gonna turn

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.130 
where i put them across I'm gonna turn
them<00:03:28.090> into<00:03:28.180> a<00:03:28.269> component<00:03:28.780> and<00:03:28.900> I'm<00:03:28.959> going<00:03:29.110> to

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
them into a component and I'm going to

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.170 
them into a component and I'm going to
in<00:03:29.500> a<00:03:29.620> sense<00:03:29.830> use<00:03:30.130> that<00:03:30.400> component<00:03:30.760> and<00:03:31.060> move

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
in a sense use that component and move

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.150 
in a sense use that component and move
that<00:03:31.360> around<00:03:31.510> in<00:03:31.870> Flash<00:03:32.260> Builder<00:03:32.560> let's<00:03:33.040> move

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
that around in Flash Builder let's move

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.670 
that around in Flash Builder let's move
this<00:03:33.280> download<00:03:34.019> so<00:03:35.019> let's<00:03:35.200> bring<00:03:35.350> in<00:03:35.440> the<00:03:35.530> next

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
this download so let's bring in the next

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:44.880 
this download so let's bring in the next
one<00:03:39.090> file<00:03:40.090> and<00:03:40.510> port

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.840 

and<00:03:45.330> we'll<00:03:46.330> put<00:03:46.450> the<00:03:46.540> ceiling<00:03:46.840> in<00:03:47.790> so<00:03:48.790> you

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
and we'll put the ceiling in so you

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.010 
and we'll put the ceiling in so you
brought<00:03:49.030> that<00:03:49.090> in<00:03:49.360> you<00:03:49.510> want<00:03:49.660> to<00:03:49.720> bring<00:03:49.840> that

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.020 
brought that in you want to bring that

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.960 
brought that in you want to bring that
right<00:03:50.170> on<00:03:50.350> top<00:03:50.530> of<00:03:50.560> the<00:03:50.740> other<00:03:50.860> one<00:03:50.980> and<00:03:51.340> I

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
right on top of the other one and I

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.190 
right on top of the other one and I
typically<00:03:52.300> want<00:03:52.480> to<00:03:52.569> make<00:03:52.690> sure<00:03:52.720> I<00:03:52.870> go<00:03:53.050> over

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
typically want to make sure I go over

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.660 
typically want to make sure I go over
here<00:03:53.290> and<00:03:53.350> I<00:03:53.440> go<00:03:53.770> right<00:03:54.010> to<00:03:54.190> the<00:03:54.280> properties

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
here and I go right to the properties

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:55.980 
here and I go right to the properties
and<00:03:54.819> make<00:03:54.910> sure<00:03:54.940> I've<00:03:55.180> got<00:03:55.209> the<00:03:55.480> numbers<00:03:55.750> typed

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:55.990 
and make sure I've got the numbers typed

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.360 
and make sure I've got the numbers typed
in<00:03:56.110> there<00:03:56.230> so<00:03:56.319> they're<00:03:56.440> exactly<00:03:56.800> overlapping

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
in there so they're exactly overlapping

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.300 
in there so they're exactly overlapping
these<00:03:57.640> half<00:03:57.910> that<00:03:58.090> exactly<00:03:58.540> overlap<00:03:59.260> so<00:04:00.190> it's

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
these half that exactly overlap so it's

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.640 
these half that exactly overlap so it's
50<00:04:00.610> and<00:04:00.910> now<00:04:01.720> what<00:04:01.870> you<00:04:01.990> want<00:04:02.140> to<00:04:02.170> do<00:04:02.260> is<00:04:02.500> do

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
50 and now what you want to do is do

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.630 
50 and now what you want to do is do
that<00:04:02.830> for<00:04:03.130> the<00:04:03.250> next<00:04:04.980> three<00:04:05.980> images<00:04:06.250> so<00:04:06.520> go

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
that for the next three images so go

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.620 
that for the next three images so go
ahead<00:04:06.730> and<00:04:06.820> do<00:04:06.970> that<00:04:07.000> and<00:04:07.330> we'll<00:04:07.420> come<00:04:07.600> back

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
ahead and do that and we'll come back

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.880 
ahead and do that and we'll come back
when<00:04:07.870> that's<00:04:08.050> finished<00:04:10.290> so<00:04:11.290> I've<00:04:11.410> imported

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
when that's finished so I've imported

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.740 
when that's finished so I've imported
all<00:04:11.980> my<00:04:12.010> images<00:04:12.280> into<00:04:12.700> flash<00:04:13.000> catalyst<00:04:13.540> and<00:04:13.660> I

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
all my images into flash catalyst and I

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.240 
all my images into flash catalyst and I
have<00:04:13.930> a<00:04:13.959> little<00:04:14.170> bit<00:04:14.319> of<00:04:14.350> problem<00:04:14.650> here<00:04:15.040> if<00:04:15.160> I

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
have a little bit of problem here if I

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.520 
have a little bit of problem here if I
go<00:04:15.400> over<00:04:15.489> to<00:04:15.580> the<00:04:15.790> layers<00:04:16.060> panel<00:04:16.660> right<00:04:17.049> here<00:04:17.350> I

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
go over to the layers panel right here I

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.830 
go over to the layers panel right here I
see<00:04:18.010> that<00:04:18.220> they<00:04:18.609> need<00:04:18.850> to<00:04:18.940> all<00:04:19.090> be<00:04:19.120> named<00:04:19.600> and

see that they need to all be named and

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:20.909 
see that they need to all be named and
that's<00:04:19.959> going<00:04:20.049> to<00:04:20.109> be<00:04:20.200> very<00:04:20.260> helpful<00:04:20.590> want<00:04:20.859> to

that's going to be very helpful want to
bring<00:04:21.040> it<00:04:21.130> in<00:04:21.220> the<00:04:21.280> Flash<00:04:21.459> Builder<00:04:21.700> and<00:04:21.940> I

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
bring it in the Flash Builder and I

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:23.460 
bring it in the Flash Builder and I
forgot<00:04:22.690> to<00:04:22.840> name<00:04:23.020> something<00:04:23.260> I<00:04:23.350> actually

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.810 
see them so you can see that you have
this<00:04:32.620> visibility<00:04:33.040> right<00:04:33.340> here<00:04:33.490> that<00:04:33.580> turns

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
this visibility right here that turns

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:35.400 
this visibility right here that turns
things<00:04:34.000> and<00:04:34.210> on<00:04:34.330> on<00:04:34.540> and<00:04:34.600> off<00:04:35.110> so<00:04:35.230> if<00:04:35.290> I<00:04:35.350> click

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
things and on on and off so if I click

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.470 
things and on on and off so if I click
on<00:04:35.710> that<00:04:35.830> panel<00:04:36.100> highlights<00:04:36.760> that<00:04:36.910> let's<00:04:37.120> take

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
on that panel highlights that let's take

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.240 
on that panel highlights that let's take
that<00:04:37.690> has<00:04:38.140> it<00:04:38.320> been<00:04:38.440> named<00:04:38.620> and<00:04:38.800> that's

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
that has it been named and that's

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.070 
that has it been named and that's
actually<00:04:39.430> the<00:04:39.760> floor<00:04:40.210> so<00:04:40.510> let's<00:04:40.690> double<00:04:41.050> click

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
actually the floor so let's double click

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.370 
actually the floor so let's double click
on<00:04:41.350> that<00:04:41.530> and<00:04:41.740> call<00:04:42.310> that<00:04:42.460> floor<00:04:42.790> and<00:04:43.380> let's

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
on that and call that floor and let's

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.020 
on that and call that floor and let's
move<00:04:44.710> that<00:04:44.919> away<00:04:45.070> and<00:04:45.250> there's<00:04:45.669> the<00:04:45.790> right

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
move that away and there's the right

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.060 
move that away and there's the right
panel<00:04:46.360> there's<00:04:46.810> the<00:04:47.050> left<00:04:47.290> panel<00:04:47.560> and<00:04:47.800> we<00:04:47.919> need

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
panel there's the left panel and we need

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.980 
panel there's the left panel and we need
a<00:04:48.130> name<00:04:48.250> that's<00:04:48.550> named<00:04:48.850> and<00:04:49.090> here's<00:04:49.720> an<00:04:49.840> image

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
a name that's named and here's an image

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.450 
a name that's named and here's an image
that's<00:04:50.110> the<00:04:50.350> back<00:04:50.620> so<00:04:50.830> this<00:04:50.979> double<00:04:51.250> click<00:04:51.400> on

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
that's the back so this double click on

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:57.510 
that's the back so this double click on
that<00:04:51.580> and<00:04:51.640> call<00:04:51.820> that<00:04:51.970> back<00:04:54.600> and<00:04:56.220> then<00:04:57.220> we<00:04:57.340> need

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
that and call that back and then we need

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.800 
that and call that back and then we need
to<00:04:57.640> name<00:04:57.880> the<00:04:58.000> other<00:04:58.060> one<00:04:58.300> what<00:04:58.450> is<00:04:58.540> that<00:04:58.660> one

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
to name the other one what is that one

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.200 
to name the other one what is that one
that<00:04:59.169> is<00:04:59.380> the<00:04:59.620> ceiling<00:05:00.520> so<00:05:00.760> we'll<00:05:00.880> just<00:05:00.910> call

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
that is the ceiling so we'll just call

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.230 
that is the ceiling so we'll just call
that<00:05:01.360> top<00:05:02.130> okay<00:05:03.130> so<00:05:03.190> we<00:05:03.340> have<00:05:03.370> our<00:05:03.520> images<00:05:04.030> name

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
that top okay so we have our images name

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.760 
that top okay so we have our images name
now<00:05:04.479> what<00:05:04.690> we<00:05:04.780> want<00:05:04.870> to<00:05:04.960> do<00:05:05.050> is<00:05:05.169> rotate<00:05:05.410> them

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
now what we want to do is rotate them

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.680 
now what we want to do is rotate them
into<00:05:06.040> position<00:05:06.190> so<00:05:07.150> let's<00:05:07.330> add<00:05:07.510> that

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
into position so let's add that

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.330 
into position so let's add that
visibility<00:05:08.110> back<00:05:08.500> there<00:05:08.830> we<00:05:08.950> go<00:05:09.100> that's

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
visibility back there we go that's

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.219 
visibility back there we go that's
pretty<00:05:09.550> cool<00:05:09.760> and<00:05:10.000> what<00:05:10.630> I<00:05:10.660> want<00:05:10.840> to<00:05:10.930> do<00:05:11.050> now

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:11.229 
pretty cool and what I want to do now

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:12.810 
pretty cool and what I want to do now
let's<00:05:11.500> just<00:05:11.680> go<00:05:11.770> ahead<00:05:11.890> and<00:05:11.979> rotate<00:05:12.400> the<00:05:12.580> floor

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
let's just go ahead and rotate the floor

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.130 
let's just go ahead and rotate the floor
now<00:05:13.000> what<00:05:13.120> we<00:05:13.180> need<00:05:13.240> to<00:05:13.360> rotate<00:05:13.540> the<00:05:13.780> floor<00:05:14.020> is

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.140 
now what we need to rotate the floor is

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.530 
now what we need to rotate the floor is
90<00:05:14.470> degrees<00:05:14.580> so<00:05:15.580> let's<00:05:15.790> just<00:05:16.030> come<00:05:16.210> down<00:05:16.390> to

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
90 degrees so let's just come down to

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.140 
90 degrees so let's just come down to
the<00:05:16.630> bottom<00:05:16.810> and<00:05:17.050> hit<00:05:17.979> rotate<00:05:18.430> before<00:05:18.910> we<00:05:18.970> do

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
the bottom and hit rotate before we do

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.030 
the bottom and hit rotate before we do
that<00:05:19.180> we<00:05:19.600> need<00:05:19.960> to<00:05:20.110> turn<00:05:20.229> all<00:05:20.470> this<00:05:20.680> into<00:05:20.979> a

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.040 
that we need to turn all this into a

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.430 
that we need to turn all this into a
component<00:05:21.550> I<00:05:21.840> can<00:05:22.840> click<00:05:22.960> the<00:05:23.110> layer<00:05:23.290> to

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
component I can click the layer to

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.080 
component I can click the layer to
select<00:05:23.710> everything<00:05:23.950> or<00:05:24.250> I<00:05:24.310> can<00:05:24.790> just<00:05:24.820> drag

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
select everything or I can just drag

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.990 
select everything or I can just drag
over<00:05:25.300> everything<00:05:25.570> to<00:05:25.690> select<00:05:26.020> it<00:05:26.110> okay<00:05:27.000> once

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
over everything to select it okay once

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.250 
over everything to select it okay once
I've<00:05:28.180> done<00:05:28.270> that<00:05:28.330> I<00:05:28.450> want<00:05:28.660> to<00:05:28.720> right<00:05:28.900> click<00:05:28.930> on

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
I've done that I want to right click on

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.590 
I've done that I want to right click on
my<00:05:29.590> component<00:05:30.460> and<00:05:30.580> change<00:05:31.390> it<00:05:31.510> to<00:05:31.570> a

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 
my component and change it to a

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.180 
my component and change it to a
component<00:05:32.020> and<00:05:32.140> now<00:05:32.620> i<00:05:32.650> have<00:05:32.710> a<00:05:32.800> generic

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
component and now i have a generic

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.550 
component and now i have a generic
compliant<00:05:33.580> so<00:05:33.760> i<00:05:33.820> can<00:05:33.940> click<00:05:34.120> one<00:05:34.419> to<00:05:35.110> go<00:05:35.289> down

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
compliant so i can click one to go down

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.320 
compliant so i can click one to go down
now<00:05:35.590> reason<00:05:36.220> create<00:05:36.460> this<00:05:36.550> generic<00:05:36.850> component

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
now reason create this generic component

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.580 
now reason create this generic component
is<00:05:37.450> in<00:05:37.690> the<00:05:37.900> sense<00:05:38.110> i<00:05:38.229> want<00:05:38.380> to<00:05:38.440> move<00:05:38.530> this

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
is in the sense i want to move this

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.380 
is in the sense i want to move this
around<00:05:38.710> without<00:05:38.979> having<00:05:39.789> to<00:05:39.880> worry<00:05:40.060> about<00:05:40.090> the

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.390 
around without having to worry about the

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.630 
around without having to worry about the
code<00:05:40.630> i<00:05:40.900> turn<00:05:41.530> it<00:05:41.620> into<00:05:41.710> a<00:05:41.800> generic<00:05:42.190> component

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:42.640 
code i turn it into a generic component

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.580 
code i turn it into a generic component
manipulate<00:05:43.180> that<00:05:43.300> in<00:05:43.510> my<00:05:43.690> flash<00:05:43.990> builder<00:05:44.200> code

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:44.590 
manipulate that in my flash builder code

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.250 
manipulate that in my flash builder code
with<00:05:44.890> other<00:05:45.130> components<00:05:45.729> now<00:05:46.300> what<00:05:47.020> I<00:05:47.050> want<00:05:47.229> to

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
with other components now what I want to

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.870 
with other components now what I want to
do<00:05:47.350> now<00:05:47.530> is<00:05:47.560> I<00:05:47.979> this<00:05:48.340> you<00:05:48.430> can<00:05:48.550> see<00:05:48.669> there's<00:05:48.820> a

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 
do now is I this you can see there's a

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.210 
do now is I this you can see there's a
layer<00:05:49.090> over<00:05:49.450> here<00:05:49.720> with<00:05:50.080> all<00:05:50.229> my<00:05:50.410> images<00:05:50.740> in<00:05:51.100> it

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 
layer over here with all my images in it

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.770 
layer over here with all my images in it
I<00:05:51.370> want<00:05:51.789> to<00:05:51.850> turn<00:05:51.970> this<00:05:52.090> layer<00:05:52.300> into<00:05:52.510> a<00:05:52.570> group

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:52.780 
I want to turn this layer into a group

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:53.909 
I want to turn this layer into a group
because<00:05:52.930> it<00:05:53.169> needs<00:05:53.320> to<00:05:53.380> be<00:05:53.500> a<00:05:53.530> group<00:05:53.710> to<00:05:53.830> be

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 
because it needs to be a group to be

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:55.620 
because it needs to be a group to be
interactive<00:05:54.550> so<00:05:54.789> once<00:05:55.000> again<00:05:55.120> I<00:05:55.300> can<00:05:55.450> just

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
interactive so once again I can just

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:57.959 
interactive so once again I can just
drag<00:05:55.930> over<00:05:56.169> to<00:05:56.260> highlight<00:05:56.590> everything

00:05:57.959 --> 00:05:57.969 
drag over to highlight everything

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:00.350 
drag over to highlight everything
and<00:05:58.089> i'm<00:05:58.779> just<00:05:58.899> going<00:05:59.079> to<00:05:59.110> right-click<00:05:59.319> and<00:05:59.799> go

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
and i'm just going to right-click and go

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.399 
and i'm just going to right-click and go
group<00:06:01.360> now<00:06:01.509> you<00:06:01.569> can't<00:06:01.779> see<00:06:01.989> that<00:06:02.110> so<00:06:02.259> they

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:02.409 
group now you can't see that so they

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:04.889 
group now you can't see that so they
bring<00:06:02.559> that<00:06:02.709> down<00:06:02.860> so<00:06:03.069> you<00:06:03.159> can<00:06:03.509> so<00:06:04.509> right

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:04.899 
bring that down so you can so right

00:06:04.899 --> 00:06:08.699 
bring that down so you can so right
click<00:06:05.049> and<00:06:05.349> go<00:06:05.549> group<00:06:06.809> and<00:06:07.809> so<00:06:08.139> now<00:06:08.289> all<00:06:08.319> that's

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:08.709 
click and go group and so now all that's

00:06:08.709 --> 00:06:12.899 
click and go group and so now all that's
a<00:06:08.829> group<00:06:09.039> and<00:06:09.279> I<00:06:09.369> can<00:06:09.549> interact<00:06:09.969> with<00:06:10.209> it<00:06:10.360> so<00:06:11.909> so

00:06:12.899 --> 00:06:12.909 
a group and I can interact with it so so

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:14.369 
a group and I can interact with it so so
let's<00:06:13.029> create<00:06:13.209> another<00:06:13.360> state<00:06:13.749> so<00:06:14.019> just<00:06:14.199> go<00:06:14.319> to

00:06:14.369 --> 00:06:14.379 
let's create another state so just go to

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:16.229 
let's create another state so just go to
duplicate<00:06:14.769> state<00:06:15.039> and<00:06:15.549> I<00:06:15.639> have<00:06:15.819> two<00:06:15.999> states

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:16.239 
duplicate state and I have two states

00:06:16.239 --> 00:06:17.999 
duplicate state and I have two states
that<00:06:16.329> I<00:06:16.419> can<00:06:16.569> transition<00:06:16.869> between<00:06:17.259> and<00:06:17.619> then

00:06:17.999 --> 00:06:18.009 
that I can transition between and then

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:19.859 
that I can transition between and then
allow<00:06:18.189> me<00:06:18.219> get<00:06:18.519> my<00:06:18.610> rotation<00:06:19.179> so<00:06:19.449> why<00:06:19.599> need<00:06:19.779> to

00:06:19.859 --> 00:06:19.869 
allow me get my rotation so why need to

00:06:19.869 --> 00:06:22.109 
allow me get my rotation so why need to
do<00:06:19.989> now<00:06:20.199> is<00:06:20.229> go<00:06:20.799> to<00:06:20.860> the<00:06:20.949> bottom<00:06:21.189> expand<00:06:21.849> this<00:06:22.059> a

00:06:22.109 --> 00:06:22.119 
do now is go to the bottom expand this a

00:06:22.119 --> 00:06:24.179 
do now is go to the bottom expand this a
little<00:06:22.209> bit<00:06:22.569> so<00:06:23.199> we<00:06:23.289> can<00:06:23.409> start<00:06:24.009> adding

00:06:24.179 --> 00:06:24.189 
little bit so we can start adding

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:25.939 
little bit so we can start adding
function<00:06:24.819> because<00:06:24.969> so<00:06:25.179> let's<00:06:25.329> go<00:06:25.419> down<00:06:25.599> here

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:25.949 
function because so let's go down here

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:28.499 
function because so let's go down here
so<00:06:26.949> the<00:06:27.069> bottom<00:06:27.339> of<00:06:27.429> flash<00:06:27.639> catalyst<00:06:28.119> there<00:06:28.329> is

00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:28.509 
so the bottom of flash catalyst there is

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:29.850 
so the bottom of flash catalyst there is
a<00:06:28.539> wonderful<00:06:29.169> little<00:06:29.259> thing<00:06:29.559> that<00:06:29.709> you<00:06:29.769> can

00:06:59.279 --> 00:06:59.289 
that's now I wanted to rotate right I

00:06:59.289 --> 00:07:01.019 
that's now I wanted to rotate right I
actually<00:06:59.439> want<00:06:59.739> to<00:06:59.799> rotate<00:06:59.919> it<00:07:00.159> down<00:07:00.369> so<00:07:00.969> I'm

00:07:01.019 --> 00:07:01.029 
actually want to rotate it down so I'm

00:07:01.029 --> 00:07:02.069 
actually want to rotate it down so I'm
gonna<00:07:01.119> go<00:07:01.209> to<00:07:01.299> my<00:07:01.329> properties<00:07:01.809> can<00:07:01.899> get<00:07:01.989> the

00:07:02.069 --> 00:07:02.079 
gonna go to my properties can get the

00:07:02.079 --> 00:07:03.239 
gonna go to my properties can get the
right<00:07:02.199> rotation<00:07:02.589> that's<00:07:02.889> come<00:07:03.039> up<00:07:03.099> here

00:07:03.239 --> 00:07:03.249 
right rotation that's come up here

00:07:03.249 --> 00:07:06.659 
right rotation that's come up here
properties<00:07:04.829> cool<00:07:05.829> make<00:07:06.129> sure<00:07:06.159> you've<00:07:06.339> clicked

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:06.669 
properties cool make sure you've clicked

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:09.119 
properties cool make sure you've clicked
on<00:07:06.849> the<00:07:07.349> rotation<00:07:08.349> let's<00:07:08.709> bring<00:07:08.919> up<00:07:09.009> your

00:07:09.119 --> 00:07:09.129 
on the rotation let's bring up your

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:11.519 
on the rotation let's bring up your
properties<00:07:09.610> there<00:07:09.639> you<00:07:10.629> go<00:07:10.749> we<00:07:11.289> want<00:07:11.469> to

00:07:11.519 --> 00:07:11.529 
properties there you go we want to

00:07:11.529 --> 00:07:13.199 
properties there you go we want to
rotate<00:07:11.619> that<00:07:11.919> downline<00:07:12.369> degree<00:07:12.729> so<00:07:13.029> let's

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:13.209 
rotate that downline degree so let's

00:07:13.209 --> 00:07:15.509 
rotate that downline degree so let's
turn<00:07:13.629> that<00:07:13.719> to<00:07:13.869> 90<00:07:14.110> degrees<00:07:14.439> there<00:07:15.039> you<00:07:15.129> go<00:07:15.279> and

00:07:15.509 --> 00:07:15.519 
turn that to 90 degrees there you go and

00:07:15.519 --> 00:07:19.619 
turn that to 90 degrees there you go and
turn<00:07:16.149> that<00:07:16.300> 20<00:07:16.719> and<00:07:18.059> now<00:07:19.059> let's<00:07:19.269> run<00:07:19.449> it<00:07:19.479> see

00:07:19.619 --> 00:07:19.629 
turn that 20 and now let's run it see

00:07:19.629 --> 00:07:23.669 
turn that 20 and now let's run it see
what<00:07:19.749> happens<00:07:21.899> there<00:07:22.899> is<00:07:23.079> an<00:07:23.229> indeed<00:07:23.499> a

00:07:23.669 --> 00:07:23.679 
what happens there is an indeed a

00:07:23.679 --> 00:07:24.929 
what happens there is an indeed a
rotation<00:07:24.219> and<00:07:24.339> it<00:07:24.399> seems<00:07:24.669> like<00:07:24.819> it

00:07:24.929 --> 00:07:24.939 
rotation and it seems like it

00:07:24.939 --> 00:07:26.579 
rotation and it seems like it
disappeared<00:07:25.449> but<00:07:26.050> actually<00:07:26.379> didn't

00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:26.589 
disappeared but actually didn't

00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:27.959 
disappeared but actually didn't
disappear<00:07:27.069> what's<00:07:27.309> happening<00:07:27.759> is<00:07:27.849> you're

00:07:27.959 --> 00:07:27.969 
disappear what's happening is you're

00:07:27.969 --> 00:07:29.699 
disappear what's happening is you're
actually<00:07:28.149> looking<00:07:28.419> straight<00:07:29.019> on<00:07:29.229> so<00:07:29.559> it's

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:29.709 
actually looking straight on so it's

00:07:29.709 --> 00:07:31.259 
actually looking straight on so it's
actually<00:07:29.799> facing<00:07:30.219> you<00:07:30.519> such<00:07:30.759> that<00:07:30.969> you<00:07:31.059> can't

00:07:31.259 --> 00:07:31.269 
actually facing you such that you can't

00:07:31.269 --> 00:07:33.359 
actually facing you such that you can't
see<00:07:31.449> top<00:07:31.659> or<00:07:31.839> bottom<00:07:32.019> now<00:07:32.649> when<00:07:32.829> we<00:07:32.860> use<00:07:33.099> move

00:07:33.359 --> 00:07:33.369 
see top or bottom now when we use move

00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:35.699 
see top or bottom now when we use move
3d<00:07:33.759> and<00:07:34.059> flash<00:07:34.419> builder<00:07:34.689> will<00:07:35.319> actually

00:07:35.699 --> 00:07:35.709 
3d and flash builder will actually

00:07:35.709 --> 00:07:37.499 
3d and flash builder will actually
translate<00:07:36.489> that<00:07:36.669> and<00:07:36.909> you'll<00:07:36.999> be<00:07:37.119> able<00:07:37.239> to<00:07:37.329> see

00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:37.509 
translate that and you'll be able to see

00:07:37.509 --> 00:07:39.209 
translate that and you'll be able to see
that<00:07:37.659> layer<00:07:37.899> you<00:07:38.409> want<00:07:38.589> to<00:07:38.679> do<00:07:38.769> this<00:07:38.919> for<00:07:39.129> this

00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:39.219 
that layer you want to do this for this

00:07:39.219 --> 00:07:41.219 
that layer you want to do this for this
next<00:07:39.639> image<00:07:40.269> so<00:07:40.449> let's<00:07:40.629> go<00:07:40.779> back<00:07:40.989> to<00:07:41.019> our

00:07:43.389 --> 00:07:44.939 
layers panel and now in our layers panel
just<00:07:43.629> as<00:07:43.809> you<00:07:43.929> would<00:07:44.079> in<00:07:44.169> Photoshop<00:07:44.739> we're

00:07:44.939 --> 00:07:44.949 
just as you would in Photoshop we're

00:07:44.949 --> 00:07:47.729 
just as you would in Photoshop we're
just<00:07:45.069> going<00:07:45.219> to<00:07:45.249> remove<00:07:45.610> the<00:07:46.089> floor<00:07:46.839> and<00:07:47.049> now

00:07:47.729 --> 00:07:47.739 
just going to remove the floor and now
