00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:09.150
 another video of me today a short one 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:12.090
 video about forecast and while it works 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.210
 So how do you find the model? 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.760
 the iphones that you have for example 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.369
 I did the Gehrig videos 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.680
 and there you have to have the right ip it 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.199
 so you find the jailbreak 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.769
 can do so now at the 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.849
 redsnow method and where the iphone is 4 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.859
 that a bit tricky 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.670
 because there are three different iphone 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:40.710
 4 models and they differ 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.719
 Outwardly almost nothing and here 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.550
 I introduce the little people to you 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.320
 program 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:52.140
 of 10 that is available for windows and mac 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.570
 currently in the version 1 4 2 here 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.520
 I already connected my iphone and 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:01.280
 Here you can read very nice which 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.719
 model you have to here the whole 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.610
 serial number and so on the 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.950
 We are not interested in that 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.159
 Of course, what hides us here 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.560
 here is the model and interested 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:18.180
 though we see we have respectively 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.159
 I have an iphone 4 1 that is not 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:27.860
 the iphone 4 this is the iphone psp 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:30.390
 see below an iphone 4 would be iphone 3.1 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.369
 or I've told 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.409
 There are several models and there are 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:40.650
 once the iphone 3,1 iphone 32 and that 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.649
 iphone 3,3 and if you can not do that 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:47.369
 right company then beats that 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:50.960
 jailbreak a lot and with precash you can 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.340
 just find out which one you need 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.299
 By the way, here you can still see the 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.219
 essays age blogs saved the auxilia 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:03.950
 I can show my name 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:06.930
 from the 6 1 6 1 and 6 1 3 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.759
 I will do that in another video 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.099
 treat in more detail 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.319
 that's the case with the five devices anyway 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.299
 not so important because you have so far 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.980
 still no possibility found the 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:22.349
 to use on the five devices 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:26.730
 more important is that he is at the four 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:28.950
 good equipment yes me jailbreak no 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.889
 yes that does not seem to be up to date 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:35.129
 be because the iphone 4s also the version 

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:39.840
 6 1 2 is very jailbreak brothers 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:43.859
 I even have birgit directly and yes that 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:48.209
 i wanted to show the iphone 4.1 model 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:50.549
 as 3.1 depending on what you have and if 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.449
 you press on it then you can 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:56.459
 also directly from the download 

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:58.469
 so that 's it from me and then 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.040
 I would say bye and bye 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:01.040
 next time
