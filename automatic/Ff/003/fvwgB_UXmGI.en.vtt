00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
that's no problem and the angle works

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.680 
that's no problem and the angle works
quite<00:00:40.350> well<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.680> put<00:00:40.860> your<00:00:40.980> phone<00:00:41.160> on<00:00:41.660> so<00:00:42.660> just

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
it learns the charge charging about what

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.420 
it learns the charge charging about what
I've<00:00:51.239> an<00:00:51.420> hour<00:00:51.629> so<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.590> did<00:00:52.770> almost<00:00:52.920> fifty

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.210 
little you know what I called in plug or
whatever<00:02:01.370> that<00:02:01.400> is<00:02:01.780> I<00:02:02.780> was<00:02:03.680> kind<00:02:03.830> of<00:02:03.860> upset<00:02:04.010> by

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
whatever that is I was kind of upset by

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.350 
whatever that is I was kind of upset by
that<00:02:04.310> goes<00:02:04.460> like<00:02:04.490> you<00:02:04.610> know<00:02:04.730> I<00:02:04.820> have<00:02:05.120> a<00:02:05.150> bunch

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
that goes like you know I have a bunch

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.270 
that goes like you know I have a bunch
of<00:02:05.510> micro<00:02:05.780> USB<00:02:06.110> cables<00:02:06.440> all<00:02:06.560> around<00:02:06.830> us<00:02:06.890> hoping

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
of micro USB cables all around us hoping

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.590 
of micro USB cables all around us hoping
that<00:02:07.370> I<00:02:07.400> would<00:02:07.520> be<00:02:07.580> able<00:02:07.640> to<00:02:07.760> use<00:02:07.850> micro<00:02:08.210> USB

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
that I would be able to use micro USB

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.570 
that I would be able to use micro USB
but<00:02:09.530> I<00:02:09.560> guess<00:02:09.770> because<00:02:09.980> they<00:02:10.190> want<00:02:10.369> to<00:02:10.429> be

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
but I guess because they want to be

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.400 
but I guess because they want to be
compatible<00:02:11.180> to<00:02:11.480> a<00:02:11.510> bunch<00:02:12.020> of<00:02:12.290> different

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
compatible to a bunch of different

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.070 
compatible to a bunch of different
