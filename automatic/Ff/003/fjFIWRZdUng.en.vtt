00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.540
 now guys online health today we go 

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:08.330
 to see this from the history of tiranosaurus 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.890
 and we will explain later on if 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.920
 you want to see the story of 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:15.020
 how this started and how the whole world 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.370
 I was confused with the megalodon but 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.660
 in the first instance let's see how 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:18.980
 activate it 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.510
 it is said that it can be activated by only one 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.320
 person but we really tried it and it's 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.240
 very unlikely so we're going to 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.340
 consider this as you have to 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.830
 do it with your friends ok this is in the 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.560
 map of road transmission or transmission 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.739
 rebel and in the first distance the 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:39.380
 First person should leave and get on 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.480
 to this excavator costs a bit of 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.510
 work if it costs a little work 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.420
 do it but here's a button where 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.149
 they have to interact very well the other 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.640
 person goes on this side dish 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:56.540
 what is the giant antenna and is going to have 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:01:00.469
 to fly with c4 this part is part 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:03.590
 which is at the height of this building if 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:06.530
 you realize here there is a small 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.930
 and columnist in which there is a button 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.720
 well you have to do the ones 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.060
 juggle that you want to put on 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.740
 there and you let yourself fall, jump, do what you 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.780
 you can do I can not give you a technique 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.030
 because it really is complicated 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.369
 biceps there is a drawing of a small 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.320
 tyrannosaurus behind some trees 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.080
 It's very beautiful what the 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.450
 tattoo but since you've been up 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.460
 or since your partner is up both 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.540
 they will have to press the button with 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:38.509
 a minimum difference of 5 seconds 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.940
 then this one since they press it they go to 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.790
 hear a sound like acceptance 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.740
 very well they are going to go to these little 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.869
 mountains already there in the background you 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.899
 you can see that there are some trees that 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:53.240
 shake out this sound does not come out to the 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.369
 first time does not come out the first time 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.740
 you have to be waiting and there are times 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.229
 that flat out in the whole round does not appear 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.649
 so it's a matter of luck for 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:07.300
 are listening to it and when really 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.300
 it works, this happens 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.920
 to me the truth is that I get scared and a lot 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.660
 Now let's explain a little bit of the 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.610
 story of why this went well 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.730
 remember in the phantom mission 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.680
 prospect that we raised them recently and in 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.290
 three as I tell you there are very 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.240
 creative go go look for missing prospect in 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.030
 internet and it turns out that a 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.640
 prospect is a book and that book here 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.560
 in the small in the small description 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.280
 of the product says that hunters 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:47.630
 intrepid have discovered the site of 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:50.240
 grounding of a warship and it 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.240
 he says he had an extraordinary treasure 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.730
 but there was something that was surrounding her 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.490
 in the water surface or under the 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.130
 surface of the water and that was something that 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.200
 it was amazing a megalodon that like 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:06.040
 you know I do not know do not know what they 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.540
 we explain a megalodon is a shark 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.960
 gigantic gigantic compared to 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.910
 the current sharks so you 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.400
 you will imagine that basically what is 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.170
 this your tooth one of your teeth measures 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.270
 what a human forearm so 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.470
 imagine the gigantic size that 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.570
 I had that thing 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.790
 and this when looking for this people 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.310
 he gave himself to his imagination and 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.320
 which is the only thing that contains boats 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.970
 stranded well we have two maps 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.190
 we have jaén and research I do not remember 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.450
 of the name in Spanish and we have for 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:40.370
 do it storm or dispose for oil 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.080
 then there is this if you give yourselves 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.800
 account then if there are boats are 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:49.070
 destroyed and that gave rise to people 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.930
 I thought there was a megalodon because 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.120
 good always just this time 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.280
 is entering the description of what 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:59.330
 that says this and dais is characterized by 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:02.420
 do things like that then this was what 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.830
 gave rise to that incredible search 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.110
 we were also looking for 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:09.470
 hours hours hours hours on boats 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:13.010
 activating nothing nothing happened and hence 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:15.170
 the idea came out that someone in the 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.380
 sound files found the roar of 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:20.060
 tyrannosaurus and had to do with trees 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.220
 so 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.980
 and it turns out that the audio file was 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.650
 registered on the rock map 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.740
 transmission from there everyone focused 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:33.980
 to search in robots transmission and apart 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.020
 of that sound they found there in 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.270
 the archives we have the multiple 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.350
 references to 'jurassic park' in 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.720
 jurassic park 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.960
 we had the visitor area I do not know if 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.000
 you remember and here in one of 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.440
 the flags we have a flag that 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.210
 call visitor center 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.610
 we also have the fence that is 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:56.300
 Chinese side and that looks a lot like the 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:58.400
 fence of the movie and also this fence 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.950
 of one of the flags behind in the 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.870
 hills we have a dead goat 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:06.530
 you will remember that the movie had 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:08.840
 a goat there that they gave him so that 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.720
 Tyrannosaurus will eat then there is 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.669
 imagine imagine everything then they were 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.250
 the clues that the guys continue to 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:18.979
 be looking here on this map and 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:21.500
 they finally found it but that's how it is 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:24.080
 as one was noticed or the 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.940
 myth of the megalodon and add what you 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.910
 to that we have a one 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:31.010
 plate a plate a capita of the single 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.050
 player that is the cardón and if not bad 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:35.570
 I remember a kart chardón is a shark 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:38.210
 white let him check to see if not 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:40.040
 it is ridiculous I was not kidding 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.930
 the guys if it's a kart chardon is a 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.780
 normal white shark then 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:47.270
 imagine, we have the reference of a 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:50.210
 megalodon that is an old relative of 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.710
 the sharks and now we get the 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.390
 Plate of the chardonnay kart 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:56.660
 we finished these guys that was a 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:58.670
 incredible paranoia everything about the 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.980
 condemned megalodón that already here I am 

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:03.260
 putting an image that is there 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.900
 incredibly big one day I will have 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.910
 one of his teeth out there in some 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.740
 wall of my house good boy I hope them 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.990
 have liked the data, get together with your 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:16.010
 friends communicate for you activate this 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:18.380
 interest but really you are going to 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:19.730
 shudder to hear it is very very beautiful 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.220
 in the most elaborate things that we have 

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:24.560
 made to discover unister 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.390
 but we hope you like guys carry 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.170
 do it and you say goodbye to you 

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:29.170
 squash tortilla
