00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 you your life was not in danger 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.310
 obviously it was something that happened to you 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.830
 girl to florence 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.180
 he is from the doctor's say 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.680
 questioned by you brings it to the 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.490
 Justice 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:17.080
 the medical diligence 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:19.450
 Your name is your name 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.640
 call him a medical malpractice not what 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.790
 What I do know is that what happened to me 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:28.000
 daughter has a name and surname and that is 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:30.699
 product probably because I do not know 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.860
 You can tell that probably why 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.769
 product of my illness she was born with 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.480
 the valve for explaining it a valve 

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:38.920
 when the buses are born, no response 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.460
 constant other the guatita the true mom 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.720
 they do not breathe but their lungs 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.159
 irrigated by the placenta 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.320
 once they are born as the typical 

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:50.170
 Pat where the baby cries and this 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.089
 open your lungs and enter the air that 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.460
 as a valve to explain it from my daughter 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:56.589
 it was much thicker then never 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.930
 it opened completely and that was something 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:00.549
 that if they could determine what is something 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.100
 that I said during the 10 days that 

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:05.290
 I was hospitalized where they stamped a 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.780
 paper in the face telling me that I was 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.299
 a mother rant and that was all good 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.680
 and that the buses when they are born before 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:13.330
 time do not find their rhythm 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.760
 breathing that was the explanation of 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.460
 Mauricio Pinto who was his doctor 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.870
 pediatrician in the clinic the counts 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:24.810
 then when what happens happens 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:27.840
 one turns around and says but 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.030
 but sorry I do not know the children are 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.159
 generally hospitalized two days 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.369
 three days four days maximum for one 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.759
 cesarean section the other ten days for me she 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.899
 is always high reference was 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.490
 treated because it was also a bus 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:43.049
 big of the normal then he was not 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.240
 never treated as a web or premature and 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.039
 during those ten days prudence had 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.720
 respiratory problems I noticed that of 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:50.610
 Florence changed its rhythm 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.649
 breathing very abruptly and its 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.210
 solution on the media at all of 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.399
 this is a doctor even that already 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.030
 declared I have a statement where 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:02.069
 where he confirms that I insisted on several 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.289
 opportunities of the situation that happens 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:09.450
 with my daughter and which was always a 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:11.580
 negative and mom to the first fuss 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.810
 that's what really happened before and 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.459
 here what happens to me when you 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.650
 questions was a medical negligence not 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.620
 I know how with the name what I know is that 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.599
 what about my daughter had medical assistance 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.220
 because one thing is that I can have a 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:26.010
 true disease that I do not have no 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.630
 have you realized, let's say, and another 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.060
 thing is that they could have done something 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:34.319
 and if you could do something your audience so 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:37.110
 simple as having applied viagra that 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.030
 is a dilator then what happens 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.769
 that the valve could have been 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.200
 could open nobody can tell you the 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.480
 evaluation is saved or not but she was coming 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.220
 with something that I insisted until the last 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.849
 minute and something I liked and that was 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.040
 tractable 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:53.519
 it was treatable only that that's what 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:58.410
 rage one causes you and day I no longer 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:03:01.680
 I do not feel angry but yes 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.060
 in the trial I do not I just tell you 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.640
 And you're looking guilty because we already 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.290
 You know that you already know, I already told you in 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.450
 face yesterday I did what I had to do 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.030
 What I would like you not to return 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.040
 to spend another mom and what I do want 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.140
 justice is done in that you know the 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.570
 true that the truth is known because 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.790
 when I talk about jaime mañalich 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.700
 many people wonder and believe that the 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.280
 demand that I do not set myself against the 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.320
 clinic is to be against jaime 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.910
 mañalich is not like that and jaime mañalich was 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.680
 the director of the clinic and it was the 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.440
 person who refused to give you information 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.000
 to the real press wants what I 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.680
 they are saying 'me in that minute I do not 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.600
 there was cause of my daughter's death after 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.690
 Autopsy they did and 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.160
 they spent Alvaro three years three years where 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.110
 I had to hire a medical expert 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.520
 where I had to do other autopsies for 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.620
 my account where I had to go claim 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.570
 my daughter's plates to the clinic and 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.610
 tell the lady who took office 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.470
 of Dr. Chomalí that did not leave 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.640
 your office and you will call by phone and 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.140
 pierre to the plates of my daughter because I 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.700
 not even confident were going to pass the 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.920
 My daughter's or someone else's license plates 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.050
 then at that level and I gave the 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.190
 situation and once I took the 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.680
 my newborn daughter plates 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:11.070
 to fight to know the truth and they were 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:15.030
 three years three years where I'm not going to 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:17.340
 to lie one to blame one to be anguished one 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.930
 suffers because he does not know what happened if and 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.600
 quote the government and if something is wrong 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.180
 as I was also blamed in the 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.160
 press for the lack of information that 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.500
 is obviously in that if they have a lot 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.690
 blame jaime mañalich 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.250
 and what should I have said about 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.990
 that moment I'm going to tell you the three 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.190
 things that I remember that I'm never going to 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.350
 forget in my life that he told me 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.850
 first that if he had been in the 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.340
 emergency service and had received 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.960
 my daughter would not have tried to save 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.730
 not even a minute because I did not know the 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.650
 little gift that I would take to the house 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.750
 that was the first thing he told me 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.160
 jaime mañalich that he did not understand as 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.330
 someone in the urgency of criticism the 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.870
 plants had tried to revive me 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:58.350
 daughter so for the time between 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:01.150
 that gave him the strike and it happened that we got to 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:04.110
 the clinic to have spent 10 minutes 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.110
 gift 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:10.340
 with some severe damage 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.010
 to which I replied that I do not know 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.740
 idea that is a doctor had the faculty 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:18.020
 to decide that he lived that he died and that in 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.030
 any case it would have been like him 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.010
 decide the gift I already did it or 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.860
 happy for my house and it 's a decision of 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:27.410
 him and the second thing he told me is that 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.610
 him when I asked him to give me the 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.680
 same explanation that I was giving to 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.060
 me or that after the autopsy that 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.820
 a criticism was made to the counts 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:37.550
 there was no cause for my daughter's death and 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.110
 that the press told him the same thing because 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.980
 it was already speculating that my daughter 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.980
 A cold had died
