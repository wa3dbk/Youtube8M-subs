00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
the openness he's probably pretty so I

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.830

use a fair amount of conditioner um

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.870 
use a fair amount of conditioner um
because<00:02:00.840> extensions<00:02:01.770> need<00:02:02.039> a<00:02:02.399> lot<00:02:02.850> of

because extensions need a lot of

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.319 
because extensions need a lot of

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
don't really have too much left so I

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.820 
don't really have too much left so I
might<00:02:15.420> just<00:02:15.840> end<00:02:16.019> up<00:02:16.170> paying<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.440> rest<00:02:16.620> of
