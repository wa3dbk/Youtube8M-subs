he<00:01:17.100> said<00:01:17.340> best<00:01:17.759> level<00:01:18.090> so<00:01:18.350> maybe<00:01:19.350> short<00:01:19.740> term

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
he said best level so maybe short term

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.520 
he said best level so maybe short term
now<00:01:20.159> we<00:01:20.220> can<00:01:20.549> say<00:01:20.729> all<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:20.939> know<00:01:21.270> he<00:01:21.450> said<00:01:21.750> it's

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
now we can say all you know he said it's

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.800 
now we can say all you know he said it's
not<00:01:22.710> good<00:01:22.890> but<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.369> long<00:01:24.030> term<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.540> would<00:01:24.689> be

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
not good but and long term it would be

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.109 
not good but and long term it would be
much<00:01:25.049> better<00:01:25.110> because<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:25.950> will<00:01:26.369> have<00:01:26.520> both<00:01:26.820> and

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
much better because I will have both and

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.170 
much better because I will have both and
if<00:01:28.110> he<00:01:28.409> plays<00:01:28.680> she<00:01:28.920> would<00:01:29.130> be<00:01:29.280> arrested<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:29.970> he

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
if he plays she would be arrested and he

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.999 
if he plays she would be arrested and he
will<00:01:30.329> have<00:01:30.509> more<00:01:31.110> energy<00:01:31.290> so<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.710> think<00:01:31.770> would

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
will have more energy so I think would

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.679 
will have more energy so I think would
be<00:01:32.159> good<00:01:32.189> for<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.610> team<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.030> will<00:01:33.390> be<00:01:33.540> good

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
be good for the team and will be good

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.020 
be good for the team and will be good
for<00:01:33.869> him<00:01:33.960> they<00:01:34.530> know<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:34.920> this<00:01:35.040> is<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.759> topic
