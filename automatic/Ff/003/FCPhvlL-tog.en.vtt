is a 24-inch monitor 61 centimeters and
it<00:00:12.840> has<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.200> full<00:00:14.360> 1920<00:00:15.360> by<00:00:15.450> 1080<00:00:15.870> P<00:00:16.109> resolution

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:16.520 
it has a full 1920 by 1080 P resolution

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.700 
it has a full 1920 by 1080 P resolution
it's<00:00:17.520> got<00:00:17.699> 10<00:00:18.060> million<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.480> 1<00:00:18.660> contrast<00:00:19.020> ratios

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
it's got 10 million to 1 contrast ratios

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.370 
it's got 10 million to 1 contrast ratios
so<00:00:20.310> we<00:00:20.369> should<00:00:20.550> get<00:00:20.670> some<00:00:20.820> nice<00:00:20.970> colors<00:00:21.390> and

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
so we should get some nice colors and

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.150 
so we should get some nice colors and
now<00:00:23.250> we're<00:00:23.519> going<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.850> unbox<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:24.830> let's<00:00:25.830> cut

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
then a power brick with a connection

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.280 
then a power brick with a connection
like<00:01:08.820> this<00:01:10.340> and<00:01:11.340> we<00:01:11.640> have<00:01:11.790> an<00:01:11.939> audio<00:01:12.330> 3.5

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
let's pull this out the base and there's

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.090 
let's pull this out the base and there's
the<00:01:36.900> base<00:01:37.610> it's<00:01:38.610> got<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.790> little<00:01:39.000> turn<00:01:39.329> screw

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
the base it's got a little turn screw

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.389 
the base it's got a little turn screw
with<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.159> flat<00:01:41.820> head<00:01:41.850> screw<00:01:42.299> driver<00:01:43.399> and<00:01:44.399> then

with a flat head screw driver and then
it's<00:01:47.399> up<00:01:47.670> very<00:01:48.360> light<00:01:49.159> there's<00:01:50.159> some

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
it's up very light there's some

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.139 
it's up very light there's some
instructions<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.570> what's<00:01:51.810> here<00:01:52.110> too<00:01:53.119> with<00:01:54.119> a

instructions of what's here too with a

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.999 
instructions of what's here too with a
CD<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:55.250> imagine<00:01:56.250> that's<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:57.170> adjust<00:01:58.170> things<00:01:58.500> so

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
CD I imagine that's to adjust things so

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.290 
CD I imagine that's to adjust things so
here<00:01:59.219> we<00:01:59.340> have<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.729> wrapped<00:01:59.939> up

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
and the power connector you don't have

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.880 
and the power connector you don't have
to<00:02:36.940> use<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.300> stand<00:02:37.570> it<00:02:38.080> has<00:02:38.320> holes<00:02:38.650> in<00:02:38.800> the

back for VESA standard wall mounts a

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.830 
back for VESA standard wall mounts a
major<00:02:43.570> drawback<00:02:44.170> to<00:02:44.740> this<00:02:45.610> monitor<00:02:45.910> is<00:02:46.570> that

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
major drawback to this monitor is that

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.680 
major drawback to this monitor is that
the<00:02:46.990> speakers<00:02:47.440> are<00:02:47.620> very<00:02:47.800> small<00:02:48.190> and<00:02:48.690> they

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
the speakers are very small and they

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.350 
the speakers are very small and they
point<00:02:50.470> backwards<00:02:50.770> so<00:02:51.370> you<00:02:51.850> have<00:02:52.030> the<00:02:52.180> volume

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
point backwards so you have the volume

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.060 
point backwards so you have the volume
all<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:52.750> way<00:02:52.870> up<00:02:53.050> on<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.230> speakers<00:02:53.710> on<00:02:53.890> the

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
all the way up on the speakers on the

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.180 
all the way up on the speakers on the
monitor<00:02:55.060> and<00:02:55.240> it's<00:02:55.870> very<00:02:56.200> very<00:02:56.440> low<00:02:56.740> I<00:02:56.950> tried

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
monitor and it's very very low I tried

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.180 
monitor and it's very very low I tried
it<00:02:57.310> with<00:02:57.430> a<00:02:57.460> HDMI<00:02:58.180> at<00:02:58.690> Apple<00:02:59.050> TV<00:02:59.410> and<00:02:59.620> the

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
it with a HDMI at Apple TV and the

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.720 
it with a HDMI at Apple TV and the
chromecast<00:03:00.460> here<00:03:01.000> and<00:03:01.180> the<00:03:01.780> audio<00:03:02.140> is<00:03:02.380> just

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
chromecast here and the audio is just

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.070
