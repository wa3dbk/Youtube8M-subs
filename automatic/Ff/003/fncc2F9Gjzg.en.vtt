to get this a 60-percent full i'm just
going<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:01.920> pump<00:01:02.250> this<00:01:02.460> in<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.090> I'm<00:01:04.079> making

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
going to pump this in and I'm making

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.310 
going to pump this in and I'm making
enough<00:01:04.680> for<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.920> couple<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.220> weeks<00:01:05.840> but<00:01:06.840> if<00:01:07.140> you

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
enough for a couple of weeks but if you

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.139 
enough for a couple of weeks but if you
just<00:01:07.470> want<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.710> make<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:07.860> for<00:01:08.159> like<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.520> couple

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:09.149 
just want to make it for like a couple

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:12.230 
just want to make it for like a couple
of<00:01:09.420> uses<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:10.020> obviously<00:01:10.439> you<00:01:10.560> just<00:01:10.920> use<00:01:11.240> less

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
of uses and obviously you just use less

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:19.100 
of uses and obviously you just use less
amount

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.620 

alright<00:01:19.980> so<00:01:20.190> it's<00:01:20.280> about<00:01:20.400> sixty<00:01:20.910> percent<00:01:21.120> full

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
alright so it's about sixty percent full

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.710 
alright so it's about sixty percent full
so<00:01:22.440> then<00:01:22.650> with<00:01:23.160> probably<00:01:23.790> like<00:01:23.970> 30<00:01:24.360> more

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
so then with probably like 30 more

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.360 
so then with probably like 30 more
percent<00:01:25.260> I'm<00:01:25.410> going<00:01:25.620> to<00:01:25.740> go<00:01:25.830> ahead<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.190> fill

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.370 
percent I'm going to go ahead and fill

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.410 
percent I'm going to go ahead and fill
it<00:01:26.550> up<00:01:26.670> with<00:01:26.730> olive<00:01:27.360> oil<00:01:28.850> so<00:01:29.850> I'm<00:01:30.120> just<00:01:30.270> go

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
it up with olive oil so I'm just go

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.680 
it up with olive oil so I'm just go
ahead<00:01:30.630> for<00:01:31.080> this<00:01:31.320> in<00:01:34.430> yeah<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.729> recommend<00:01:36.510> using

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
ahead for this in yeah I recommend using

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.969 
ahead for this in yeah I recommend using
an<00:01:36.960> inexpensive<00:01:37.530> brand<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.250> olive<00:01:38.580> oil<00:01:39.979> and

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
an inexpensive brand of olive oil and

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.219 
an inexpensive brand of olive oil and
olive<00:01:41.940> oil<00:01:42.150> also<00:01:42.450> will<00:01:42.780> break<00:01:42.960> down<00:01:42.990> the

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
olive oil also will break down the

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.200 
olive oil also will break down the
molecules<00:01:43.710> in<00:01:44.160> gel<00:01:44.400> liner<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.760> forgot<00:01:45.030> to

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
molecules in gel liner I forgot to

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.500 
molecules in gel liner I forgot to
include<00:01:45.300> that<00:01:45.479> at<00:01:45.900> the<00:01:46.020> beginning<00:01:46.110> so<00:01:46.710> that

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
include that at the beginning so that

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.690 
include that at the beginning so that
are<00:01:48.510> like<00:01:48.750> never<00:01:48.990> okay<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:50.370> then<00:01:50.670> you're

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
are like never okay and then you're

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.460 
are like never okay and then you're
going<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:50.940> want<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.150> leave<00:01:51.270> ten<00:01:51.540> percent<00:01:52.050> just

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
going to want to leave ten percent just

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.140 
going to want to leave ten percent just
so<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.650> have<00:01:52.770> extra<00:01:53.070> room<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.369> shake<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:54.000> up

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
so you have extra room to shake it up

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.390 
so you have extra room to shake it up
really<00:01:54.360> well<00:01:57.140> okay<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:59.040> then<00:01:59.220> you're<00:01:59.250> going

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
lot trickier now what I tend to do is

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:50.910 
lot trickier now what I tend to do is
take<00:03:49.159> a<00:03:49.190> little<00:03:49.400> bit<00:03:49.579> of<00:03:49.640> extra<00:03:50.060> olive<00:03:50.480> oil

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
take a little bit of extra olive oil

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.380 
take a little bit of extra olive oil
because<00:03:51.920> allah<00:03:52.400> is<00:03:52.700> going<00:03:52.970> to<00:03:53.030> be<00:03:53.150> what's

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
because allah is going to be what's

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.229 
because allah is going to be what's
going<00:03:53.659> to<00:03:53.750> really<00:03:53.930> break<00:03:54.260> down<00:03:54.489> the<00:03:55.489> gel<00:03:55.940> liner

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
going to really break down the gel liner

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.210 
going to really break down the gel liner
because<00:03:56.870> gel<00:03:57.169> liner<00:03:57.380> is<00:03:57.560> very<00:03:57.799> hard<00:03:58.010> to<00:03:58.099> get

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
because gel liner is very hard to get

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.909 
because gel liner is very hard to get
off<00:03:58.959> so<00:03:59.959> these<00:04:00.109> are<00:04:00.169> the<00:04:00.319> last<00:04:00.470> brushes<00:04:00.889> that

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:00.919 
off so these are the last brushes that

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:03.159 
off so these are the last brushes that
exceed<00:04:01.400> our<00:04:01.609> my<00:04:01.880> gel<00:04:02.209> liner<00:04:02.389> brush<00:04:02.599> is<00:04:02.840> just

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:03.169 
exceed our my gel liner brush is just

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:05.589 
exceed our my gel liner brush is just
because<00:04:03.380> they're<00:04:03.530> so<00:04:03.739> hard<00:04:03.980> to<00:04:04.040> get<00:04:04.190> clean<00:04:04.599> but

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
because they're so hard to get clean but

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:07.330 
because they're so hard to get clean but
as<00:04:05.750> you<00:04:05.900> can<00:04:05.989> see<00:04:06.230> this<00:04:06.380> olive<00:04:06.769> oil<00:04:06.950> is<00:04:07.099> really

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
as you can see this olive oil is really

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.099 
as you can see this olive oil is really
breaking<00:04:07.579> down<00:04:07.730> all<00:04:08.180> the<00:04:09.220> molecules<00:04:10.220> in

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
breaking down all the molecules in

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:14.619 
breaking down all the molecules in
lerner<00:04:12.760> so<00:04:13.760> then<00:04:13.910> once<00:04:14.090> you<00:04:14.239> get<00:04:14.389> the<00:04:14.510> most

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:14.629 
lerner so then once you get the most

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:16.870 
lerner so then once you get the most
