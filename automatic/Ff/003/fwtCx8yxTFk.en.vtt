00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.670
 hey and again welcome 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.050
 at every handyman halli hello here 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.500
 I'm back with the review of 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:25.460
 gigabyte gtx 780g the zion with the wine 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.050
 forest 3x cooler in 54 watt versions 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.210
 have just lost weight here 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.760
 and that's how the naked one presents itself 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.140
 gigabyte card baby board is like 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.400
 you sure already in the previous video 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.650
 have seen or 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.210
 still be seen completely in black 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.460
 held for most murders 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.370
 or people who have a window in the pc 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.589
 have to be very interesting 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.000
 in the middle of the board or something 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:49.940
 of course, we find the one in front 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.949
 gek 110 graphics chip 300 in the b1 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.229
 between speaks he is on the 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:55.640
 efficiency slightly optimized in consumption 

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:57.440
 a little less power and offers thereby 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.140
 also these higher taktraten the 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.449
 gigahertz edition around this part 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.590
 or to find the gpu around 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:09.620
 Here are the 246 18 12 memory modules 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.080
 the worries for the three gigabytes gddr5 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.240
 store this over a 384 bit wide 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.140
 memory interface offered and the 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.210
 Memory clocks with 1502 megahertz 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.649
 further back on the board here parts 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.320
 of course the power supply of the 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:27.020
 gpu and not to forget the two 8 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.479
 pin power connections via the the gpu 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.950
 Of course, your electricity also comes with you 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.740
 while a fan connection two 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.570
 Connections and a pci express slot with 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.210
 he of course the card in your pc 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.649
 could also be interesting 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.840
 maybe the ghc edition the 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:44.990
 tactics slightly higher than 1000 megawatts 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.299
 namely more precisely with 1019 megahertz and 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.979
 clocks vaccine up to 1000 71 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.420
 megahertz what are you packing yourself 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.189
 Of course it is still possible with this 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.249
 nice card here , we'll take a look 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:56.749
 in the test a little closer 

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:58.939
 that would be the naked board 

00:01:56.749 --> 00:02:00.619
 Let's just say we will 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.479
 a look at the actual 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.140
 heat sink I have the whole thing times 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.759
 removed 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.469
 He already knows that on mine 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.890
 I say other reviews 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:12.110
 so it just looks down below consists of 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.600
 two cool units here and here 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.340
 here, of course, a copper base plate 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.530
 as with the heatpipes 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.030
 here the heat to the aluminum slats 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.150
 let's find here in the front 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.780
 Area 50 these aluminum lamellas 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:29.170
 in the back it is combined 53 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:32.980
 the whole with 4 6 mm heatpipes 1 2 3 4 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.689
 and 28 mm heatpipes also for the 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.340
 Cooling or cooling the 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:39.129
 Cooling the memory blocks you see 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.909
 Here very nice to the heat conductor and 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:42.519
 here is also the back 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:44.769
 voltage supply with cooled this here 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.390
 is the connection for the three 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.849
 Fans are installed on it 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.159
 4 pin connection for normal graphics cards 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:55.299
 Of course, we should turn the whole thing 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:57.220
 Ding then we can have a look 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.260
 Throw on the three fans 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.870
 each with a diameter of 75 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.120
 millimeters and just by software 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.760
 about the respective graphics card software 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.319
 regulated the cool has also include 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.760
 you already from other wine funds 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.200
 cooler knows as for example in the 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.260
 Deeply shared out I tested 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.079
 or at the normal gtx 780 about this 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.090
 black aluminum cover up here 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:21.579
 on it the black anodized and brushed 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.290
 lettering with the wine FOMC said force 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:25.659
 I have a difficult word on it anyway 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.269
 but that's how it gets 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:30.069
 still a noble finish missed so far 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:33.790
 There are no major differences 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:35.769
 former normal gtx 780 times though 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.930
 gigabyte now has about this 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.489
 gigant edition not only send this 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.699
 heatsink here but now there is yes 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:44.650
 also a backplate like you here 

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:47.199
 can recognize very nice too 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.870
 black anodized brushed 

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:51.400
 aluminum and brushed like just 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.769
 addressed with the inscription 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.909
 gigahertz edition and gigabit problem 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.849
 the thing is that part is 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:58.840
 printed mirrored here on 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.129
 Say if you install the pc 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.709
 you have to handstand this 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:04.269
 really can read around or you let 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.340
 just like that and then you just have to 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:08.049
 Think what it means is combined 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.819
 of course this whole world with the 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:11.169
 stiffen china by the side that every 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:14.049
 here very nice there again 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:15.609
 imprint gigahertz lettering backplate 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:17.199
 gives the whole - in the pc 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:18.609
 built-in nevertheless has a very nice 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:20.500
 noble look especially as 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.570
 just when you have a window 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.099
 should have in the pc and which ensures to 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.780
 others for that the whole part 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:28.330
 is stiffer and that is the 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:31.840
 pcb does not look at it because of the 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.430
 It is quite difficult for a coach 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.849
 It would be time for my revier 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.559
 video to the actual 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:39.020
 body a more precise technical 

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:40.399
 execution or the video where 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.839
 I turn the cooler off completely 

00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:43.159
 have taken apart you will find 

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:44.449
 also on youtube I have too 

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:46.219
 under this video then linked there 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:48.559
 could also take a look like that 

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:50.059
 cooler of the completely disassembled I looks 

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:51.649
 hope the video has fallen again 

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:53.330
 and a little insight into this 

00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:54.349
 send a high end video card from 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.819
 gigabytes given 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:57.080
 Just leave me an abo called you 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:58.999
 If you have not already done so 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.919
 I wish you some happy ones 

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:01.879
 Christmas ever and I hope 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:05.080
 See you at your next club 

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:05.080
 again until then new
