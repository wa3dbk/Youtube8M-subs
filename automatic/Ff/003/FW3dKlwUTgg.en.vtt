00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:19.560
 Talk to me, people, good beauty. I'm with the plate. 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:24.330
 humidity below 75 m brings from 3h 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.939
 is from socket 1155 with the chipset of 75 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.689
 that the chipset that does not do anything else is 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.500
 the pci express 3.0 table already gives this 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.480
 Support 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.270
 it already gives support to Bible that 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.870
 22 nanometer processors're it 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.379
 has usb 3.0 and it has as always the 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.640
 tac protections is against the unit 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.190
 electrostatic against having energy face 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.649
 when the temperature is here we 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.230
 have realized she was generally going 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.360
 on the plates but never with the 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.030
 glass né dacha tougher to perceive 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.030
 Some cables are answered, do some 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.649
 shit you will not lose the tool is 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.280
 we have something very interesting 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.439
 which is the support intel esmal god not 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.549
 I'm going to leave the registration 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.049
 You will try to enter the sites. 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.049
 manufacturer will not have all the 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.270
 information on it is this here 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.150
 company is normal for the user is 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.290
 one more company here is now seeing 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.290
 the packaging she is 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.200
 beauty behind here we have with 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.270
 the tests with the protections we have 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.400
 a plate photo 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.040
 some very cool specs here 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.590
 you can take a look is your choice 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.659
 He is now doing the opening 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:45.330
 packaging showing what it contains inside 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:50.159
 there're the mirror is as always obvious 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:59.280
 that comes with blue sata motherboard né 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:02:03.840
 to gigabyte the manual of the plate she that 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:06.409
 here did not come with the cb 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:18.269
 but all you buy in the market 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:22.319
 I accompanied my father and made several videos 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:25.019
 on motherboards of gigabyte hp montal 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.730
 the mds here has something very 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.900
 interesting other than the veil 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.360
 simpler 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.209
 it has four memory banks button 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.540
 already makes two of the altino 's here we have 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:39.600
 two express pci is reminding her that 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.570
 to support crossfirefire and is 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.910
 It's good to have it in the box. 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.320
 That's it but I researched someone from the 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:56.820
 I would realize she gives 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:59.130
 It shows 23 and that's what's good about you. 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.079
 you can put a card and a card 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.070
 and the sound of it is a good sound. 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:05.010
 simple 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:08.190
 it was also a motherboard is just that 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.350
 Very economical board but its micro cpu is 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.510
 four pins you can see that it does not 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.850
 have to happen in its phases which is 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.739
 Pretty simple is it really you're going to buy 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.750
 for you to put the processor on a board 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.420
 of risks is to do with the opinions you 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.760
 Can also do but is to play for 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.170
 you have fun 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.900
 those who have as usual by 24 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.380
 pins in the work here a fan output and 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.340
 here is the fable 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.360
 question is time is on and let's go here 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.150
 you call 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:41.110
 panels four shoes here 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:43.330
 athletes 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.000
 let's see the part of her panel here 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:49.510
 that we have here a way out of 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.970
 vehicle to a hybrid and you can 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.610
 leave the mouse or keyboard here two to 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.220
 You connect a mouse and keyboard too. 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:02.950
 very interesting hdmi output and two 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:05.920
 usbs 3.021 this month 2.0 was out of 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:09.360
 network and here the audio output can 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:13.570
 to see that it is very simple is nothing 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:16.870
 back of the plate as always the plates 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:20.140
 simple the gigabyte is to realize the join is 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.940
 A very cool board is you want to play. 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.400
 not want to have your headache 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.760
 computer will not copy environmentally 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:31.060
 can buy any professional and 31 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.520
 and five bowls is a sweet says né places 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.310
 two video cards you choose and 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.740
 put the memories you play have fun 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.380
 on the motherboard very good for this type 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:44.170
 team has used it did some tests and stuff 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:47.260
 but it is not something that is worth 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.850
 highlight is I will not show coats 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:51.310
 because it does not make my own I do not 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.140
 I have a lot of things to show a lot 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.190
 thanks for watching me motherboard 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.920
 10 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.290
 recommends whether to play can buy without 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.660
 Corn is thank you for having stirred 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.850
 one more video click on you below if 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.890
 subscribe to channel sharing networks 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.820
 to give strength and even 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.820
 next rain
