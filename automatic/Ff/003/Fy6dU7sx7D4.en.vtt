00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:05.500
 This is the height of happiness 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.480
 I left at my house and he said who 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.290
 invites today to eat and appears 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.290
 this by magic 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:18.640
 your guest how are you so fair 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.070
 you surprise me by making a recipe that 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.050
 love because it's easy is practice not 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.900
 I need a lot to prepare we are going to 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.300
 make some wrapped beef medallions 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.250
 with bacon and a mushroom sauce 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.259
 well rich so there is something good 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.660
 juicy first thing look for a 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.000
 Certificate of trust establishment 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.820
 in the establishments you will find 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.670
 a green stamp that means you can 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.040
 buy with complete peace of mind or one 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.200
 yellow otherwise if you find a 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.650
 establishment with Mr. red nor 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:52.240
 risks to me is not at all 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.010
 reliable then see how they have cooled 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.140
 and how they are exhibiting the meat that the 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.600
 meats are classified that are not 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.670
 mixing the pork with the chicken and the net 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.010
 because this contaminates the vending machine 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.970
 of meat is very well presented 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.310
 preferably everything 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.930
 and use a knife with mechanical handles 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.940
 good what ingredients are you going to use 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.220
 for this recipe the ingredients are 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:17.550
 just bacon myths 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.730
 butter mushrooms in the cream mine 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.560
 of milk salt and pepper first we have 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.840
 the beef as I told you to have 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.630
 a good look you're going fresquita 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.010
 to shape it well round and what 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.330
 let's do is let's move on to 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:36.330
 Spend bacon strips around 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.890
 and fix them with toothpicks and 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.080
 here I have a pan at a good temperature 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.310
 because we're going to seal them and we're going to 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.310
 put a little butter 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.130
 once we have sealed it a minute 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.570
 On the one hand we simply turn and 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.300
 see what color so rich new york 'and 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.950
 pretty I'll put the sauce once 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.540
 here while I do it, it ends 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.450
 be done to take a term a little bit 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:06.440
 more cooked now comes the total secret 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:08.660
 yes sir that I pass you the sauce of the 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:12.470
 hand of the cook of the passing changes 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:15.080
 things and right here and what I'm going to 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.900
 to do is lower the fire so that the 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.850
 sauce is simply shrinking and 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.030
 look at what a rich color and what a nice color 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.390
 taking 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.130
 very good especially I love the aroma 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.550
 that is peeling off of that pan 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:33.069
 and look at the rich little golden color 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.080
 we remove the chopsticks I love the 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.569
 juiciness that looks on top of the meat 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.370
 incredible you know that the most important thing 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.170
 I insist is the subject of buying meat 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.890
 in places of trust look for the seal 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:49.000
 always seal green stamp yellow like 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.709
 - and keep it very well refrigerated 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.500
 so that I am always with the best 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.180
 taste and the best quality because we 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.920

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.380

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.340
 food but additionally know very 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.560

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.630

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.100
 the table be a joy a joy for 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.569
 the palate but a joy also for 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.069
 the heart and for the body and so 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.350
 we are all active and look 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:14.160
 Look, look, look at this, tell me silvio,
