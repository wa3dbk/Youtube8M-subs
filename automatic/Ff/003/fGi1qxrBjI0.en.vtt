00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:27.120 
dancing like a madman and we did think

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.970 
dancing like a madman and we did think
about<00:00:27.210> putting<00:00:27.570> up<00:00:27.780> a<00:00:28.050> five<00:00:28.500> minute<00:00:28.740> video<00:00:28.800> of

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
about putting up a five minute video of

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.560 
about putting up a five minute video of
just<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.550> thing<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.790> you<00:00:30.000> looped<00:00:30.240> with<00:00:30.450> me

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
just the thing to you looped with me

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.050 
just the thing to you looped with me
sing<00:00:30.840> along<00:00:31.110> but<00:00:31.290> I<00:00:31.320> was<00:00:31.500> told<00:00:31.770> perhaps<00:00:32.490> that

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:33.060 
sing along but I was told perhaps that

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.090 
sing along but I was told perhaps that
wouldn't<00:00:33.390> be<00:00:33.450> ideal<00:00:33.870> for<00:00:34.230> viewers<00:00:34.800> so<00:00:34.980> we

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
wouldn't be ideal for viewers so we

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.979 
wouldn't be ideal for viewers so we
thought<00:00:35.220> we'd<00:00:35.370> use<00:00:35.610> in<00:00:35.730> gameplay<00:00:35.970> as<00:00:36.570> we've

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
thought we'd use in gameplay as we've

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.350 
thought we'd use in gameplay as we've
been<00:00:37.020> playing<00:00:37.470> a<00:00:37.530> bit<00:00:37.560> of<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.830> remastered<00:00:38.460> hdf
