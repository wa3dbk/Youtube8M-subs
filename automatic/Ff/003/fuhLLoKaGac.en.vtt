00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
weight essentially the bottom line to

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.990 
weight essentially the bottom line to
why<00:00:51.440> you<00:00:51.500> gained<00:00:51.949> weight<00:00:52.070> is<00:00:52.460> because<00:00:52.850> you

why you gained weight is because you

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.529 
why you gained weight is because you
consumed<00:00:53.510> more<00:00:54.350> calories<00:00:54.410> than<00:00:55.309> you<00:00:56.269> burned

consumed more calories than you burned
in<00:00:56.840> a<00:00:57.019> day<00:00:57.309> now<00:00:58.600> let's<00:00:59.600> say<00:00:59.840> my<00:01:00.649> daily<00:01:01.550> intake

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
in a day now let's say my daily intake

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.020 
in a day now let's say my daily intake
is<00:01:02.179> 2,000<00:01:02.929> calories<00:01:03.320> for<00:01:04.220> my<00:01:04.340> age<00:01:04.550> and<00:01:04.970> my

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
is 2,000 calories for my age and my

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.440 
is 2,000 calories for my age and my
height<00:01:06.009> and<00:01:07.009> then<00:01:07.670> I<00:01:08.350> consume<00:01:10.000> 2020<00:01:11.000> calories

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
height and then I consume 2020 calories

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.289 
height and then I consume 2020 calories
and<00:01:12.200> I'm<00:01:12.290> pretty<00:01:12.500> consistent<00:01:13.220> at<00:01:13.310> that<00:01:13.549> so

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
and I'm pretty consistent at that so

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.590 
and I'm pretty consistent at that so
over<00:01:14.720> the<00:01:14.840> weeks<00:01:15.110> over<00:01:15.470> the<00:01:16.250> months<00:01:16.580> over<00:01:17.180> the

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
over the weeks over the months over the

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.380 
over the weeks over the months over the
years<00:01:18.020> I<00:01:18.380> will<00:01:18.950> gain<00:01:19.189> weight<00:01:19.490> there<00:01:20.119> is<00:01:20.240> no

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
years I will gain weight there is no

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.399 
years I will gain weight there is no
question<00:01:20.570> because<00:01:21.259> I<00:01:21.500> my<00:01:22.460> intake<00:01:23.409> caloric

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
question because I my intake caloric

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.859 
question because I my intake caloric
intake<00:01:24.890> is<00:01:25.130> higher<00:01:25.490> than<00:01:26.299> the<00:01:26.360> amount<00:01:26.750> of

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
intake is higher than the amount of

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:28.480 
intake is higher than the amount of
calories<00:01:27.320> that<00:01:27.350> I'm<00:01:27.590> burning<00:01:27.979> that's

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
calories that I'm burning that's

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.940 
calories that I'm burning that's
essentially<00:01:29.030> true<00:01:29.240> with<00:01:29.450> everybody<00:01:30.140> that<00:01:30.409> is

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
essentially true with everybody that is

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.399 
essentially true with everybody that is
for<00:01:31.579> everybody<00:01:31.850> overweight<00:01:32.570> and<00:01:32.810> then<00:01:33.170> in

for everybody overweight and then in

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.370 
for everybody overweight and then in
some<00:01:33.740> cases<00:01:33.979> it's<00:01:34.310> different<00:01:34.700> some<00:01:35.380> some

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
you know and I walk around at work and

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:04.990 
you know and I walk around at work and
stuff<00:02:02.390> like<00:02:02.509> that<00:02:02.570> and<00:02:03.490> i'm<00:02:04.490> still<00:02:04.789> gaining

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
stuff like that and i'm still gaining

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.630 
stuff like that and i'm still gaining
weight<00:02:05.240> well<00:02:05.630> in<00:02:06.020> that<00:02:06.170> case<00:02:06.229> it's<00:02:06.920> most

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
weight well in that case it's most

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.810 
weight well in that case it's most
likely<00:02:07.729> the<00:02:08.380> portion<00:02:09.380> size<00:02:09.649> of<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.399> amount<00:02:10.610> of

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
likely the portion size of the amount of

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.510 
likely the portion size of the amount of
food<00:02:11.390> that<00:02:11.450> you're<00:02:12.110> taking<00:02:12.470> in<00:02:12.710> is<00:02:12.950> is

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
food that you're taking in is is

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.160 
food that you're taking in is is
probably<00:02:13.970> too<00:02:14.240> high

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
probably too high

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.040 
probably too high
so<00:02:15.400> it<00:02:16.400> goes<00:02:16.550> back<00:02:16.849> to<00:02:16.880> consuming<00:02:17.840> more

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
so it goes back to consuming more

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.170 
so it goes back to consuming more
calories<00:02:18.110> than<00:02:18.590> you<00:02:18.980> burn<00:02:19.010> that<00:02:19.250> day<00:02:19.670> and<00:02:19.970> then

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
calories than you burn that day and then

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.520 
calories than you burn that day and then
if<00:02:20.300> you<00:02:20.420> take<00:02:20.599> the<00:02:20.720> weeks<00:02:20.930> months<00:02:21.349> and<00:02:21.440> years

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
if you take the weeks months and years

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.130 
if you take the weeks months and years
you<00:02:21.920> will<00:02:22.040> gain<00:02:22.250> weight<00:02:22.660> okay<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:23.810> second

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
you will gain weight okay the second

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.350 
you will gain weight okay the second
thing<00:02:24.290> you<00:02:24.319> need<00:02:24.440> to<00:02:24.590> know<00:02:24.880> it's<00:02:25.880> a<00:02:26.000> little<00:02:26.239> bit

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
thing you need to know it's a little bit

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.860 
thing you need to know it's a little bit
about<00:02:26.540> nutrition<00:02:27.230> is<00:02:27.580> what<00:02:28.580> they<00:02:28.670> call<00:02:28.790> a<00:02:28.870> 494

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
about nutrition is what they call a 494

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.260 
about nutrition is what they call a 494
rule<00:02:30.200> if<00:02:30.500> you<00:02:30.680> look<00:02:30.860> on<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.130> box<00:02:31.400> of<00:02:31.790> most<00:02:32.150> of

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
rule if you look on the box of most of

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.059 
rule if you look on the box of most of
the<00:02:32.360> products<00:02:32.780> that<00:02:32.930> you<00:02:33.110> you<00:02:33.680> buy<00:02:33.860> at<00:02:33.920> the

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
the products that you you buy at the

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.820 
the products that you you buy at the
grocery<00:02:34.100> store<00:02:34.630> you're<00:02:35.630> going<00:02:35.750> to<00:02:35.840> see<00:02:36.020> the

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
grocery store you're going to see the

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.020 
grocery store you're going to see the
amount<00:02:37.010> of<00:02:37.390> carbohydrates<00:02:38.620> fats<00:02:39.620> and

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
amount of carbohydrates fats and

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.750 
amount of carbohydrates fats and
proteins<00:02:41.920> listed<00:02:42.920> on<00:02:43.069> the<00:02:43.250> side<00:02:43.430> of<00:02:43.459> the<00:02:43.580> box

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.660 
proteins listed on the side of the box
in<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:44.780> 494<00:02:45.380> is<00:02:45.620> four<00:02:45.950> calories<00:02:46.190> for

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
in the 494 is four calories for

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.240 
in the 494 is four calories for
carbohydrates<00:02:47.420> so<00:02:48.050> I'll<00:02:48.170> carbohydrates<00:02:49.040> like

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
carbohydrates so I'll carbohydrates like

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.620 
carbohydrates so I'll carbohydrates like
pastas<00:02:49.790> and<00:02:49.819> rice<00:02:50.410> grains<00:02:51.410> sugars<00:02:52.630> they're

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
pastas and rice grains sugars they're

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.990 
pastas and rice grains sugars they're
all<00:02:53.780> essentially<00:02:54.650> four<00:02:55.010> calories<00:02:55.430> per<00:02:55.970> gram

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
all essentially four calories per gram

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.880 
all essentially four calories per gram
and<00:02:56.810> then<00:02:57.709> nine<00:02:58.100> is<00:02:58.430> all<00:02:58.640> for<00:02:58.910> fats<00:02:59.350> so<00:03:00.350> that's

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
and then nine is all for fats so that's

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.500 
and then nine is all for fats so that's
from<00:03:01.220> animals<00:03:02.470> dairy<00:03:03.470> products<00:03:04.040> all<00:03:04.610> the<00:03:05.060> oils

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
from animals dairy products all the oils

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.440 
from animals dairy products all the oils
canola<00:03:06.080> oil<00:03:06.560> vegetable<00:03:06.830> oil<00:03:07.310> olive<00:03:08.090> oil<00:03:08.299> all

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
canola oil vegetable oil olive oil all

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.910 
canola oil vegetable oil olive oil all
the<00:03:08.630> oils<00:03:08.930> anything<00:03:09.350> that<00:03:09.470> has<00:03:09.560> to<00:03:09.590> do<00:03:09.799> with

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
the oils anything that has to do with

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.759 
the oils anything that has to do with
fat<00:03:10.220> is<00:03:10.549> essentially<00:03:11.330> nine<00:03:11.690> gram<00:03:12.260> nine

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
fat is essentially nine gram nine

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.350 
fat is essentially nine gram nine
calories<00:03:13.160> per<00:03:13.610> gram<00:03:13.959> and<00:03:14.959> then<00:03:15.170> the<00:03:15.830> other<00:03:16.360> 449

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
calories per gram and then the other 449

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.140 
calories per gram and then the other 449
for<00:03:17.750> the<00:03:17.959> last<00:03:18.170> four<00:03:18.470> is<00:03:18.500> protein<00:03:19.190> so<00:03:19.910> all<00:03:20.060> the

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
for the last four is protein so all the

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.910 
for the last four is protein so all the
proteins<00:03:20.600> essentially<00:03:21.200> get<00:03:21.440> you<00:03:21.620> getting

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
proteins essentially get you getting

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:28.289 
proteins essentially get you getting
meats<00:03:22.220> chicken<00:03:22.760> fish<00:03:23.329> beef<00:03:25.750> some<00:03:26.750> beans

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
meats chicken fish beef some beans

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:31.930 
meats chicken fish beef some beans
essentially<00:03:29.299> four<00:03:29.840> calories<00:03:30.220> so<00:03:31.220> by<00:03:31.730> knowing

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
essentially four calories so by knowing

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.370 
essentially four calories so by knowing
that<00:03:32.329> you<00:03:32.930> know<00:03:32.959> that<00:03:33.350> if<00:03:33.680> your<00:03:34.070> diet<00:03:34.940> is<00:03:35.380> is

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
that you know that if your diet is is

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.920 
that you know that if your diet is is
high<00:03:36.709> in<00:03:36.890> fats<00:03:37.190> let's<00:03:37.670> say<00:03:37.820> for<00:03:38.480> breakfast

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
okay it's a lot of oil there for that

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.449 
okay it's a lot of oil there for that
breakfast<00:03:54.200> and<00:03:54.470> then<00:03:54.500> for<00:03:54.769> lunch<00:03:54.950> they<00:03:55.250> go<00:03:55.400> to

chicken something like that and then if

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.920 
chicken something like that and then if
you<00:04:10.040> look<00:04:10.160> at<00:04:10.280> that<00:04:10.430> diet<00:04:10.730> it's<00:04:11.150> it's<00:04:11.600> very

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
you look at that diet it's it's very

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.740 
you look at that diet it's it's very
high<00:04:12.139> in<00:04:12.170> fat<00:04:12.530> and<00:04:13.090> when<00:04:14.090> you<00:04:14.180> have<00:04:14.209> very<00:04:14.660> high

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
high in fat and when you have very high

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.640 
high in fat and when you have very high
in<00:04:14.959> a<00:04:15.500> fat<00:04:16.220> diet<00:04:16.870> you<00:04:17.870> know<00:04:17.900> your<00:04:18.229> caloric

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
in a fat diet you know your caloric

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.219 
in a fat diet you know your caloric
intake<00:04:19.280> goes<00:04:19.669> way<00:04:19.940> up<00:04:19.970> it's<00:04:20.479> you<00:04:20.900> go<00:04:21.019> back<00:04:21.200> to

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
intake goes way up it's you go back to

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:24.610 
intake goes way up it's you go back to
the<00:04:21.410> 494<00:04:22.370> role<00:04:22.850> where<00:04:23.450> there's<00:04:23.810> nine<00:04:24.110> calories

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
the 494 role where there's nine calories

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:25.240 
the 494 role where there's nine calories
per

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
per

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.300 
per
gram<00:04:25.370> of<00:04:25.400> fat<00:04:25.700> so<00:04:26.830> those<00:04:27.830> are<00:04:28.010> the<00:04:28.070> two<00:04:28.280> things

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
gram of fat so those are the two things

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.220 
gram of fat so those are the two things
you<00:04:28.610> need<00:04:28.820> to<00:04:28.850> know<00:04:29.830> so<00:04:30.830> how<00:04:31.670> do<00:04:31.730> you<00:04:32.240> go<00:04:33.200> about

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
you need to know so how do you go about

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.340 
you need to know so how do you go about
losing<00:04:33.800> weight<00:04:33.830> well<00:04:34.310> the<00:04:34.940> secret<00:04:35.180> is<00:04:35.480> you

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
losing weight well the secret is you

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.980 
losing weight well the secret is you
essentially<00:04:37.010> have<00:04:37.040> to<00:04:37.610> reverse<00:04:38.330> the<00:04:38.810> process

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
essentially have to reverse the process

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:42.260 
eat well balanced diets I mean you could

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:43.930 
eat well balanced diets I mean you could
have<00:05:42.320> that<00:05:42.500> piece<00:05:42.890> of<00:05:43.070> chocolate<00:05:43.280> cake<00:05:43.460> and

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
have that piece of chocolate cake and

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.290 
have that piece of chocolate cake and
you<00:05:44.030> could<00:05:44.180> have<00:05:44.330> that<00:05:44.390> that<00:05:45.169> that<00:05:45.860> fried<00:05:46.220> food

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
you could have that that that fried food

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.760 
you could have that that that fried food
it's<00:05:47.300> just<00:05:47.419> you<00:05:47.690> got<00:05:47.840> to<00:05:47.960> moderate<00:05:48.410> the

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.770 
it's just you got to moderate the

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.800 
it's just you got to moderate the
proportions<00:05:49.669> and<00:05:49.880> you<00:05:49.970> can't<00:05:50.240> do<00:05:50.419> it<00:05:50.570> every

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
proportions and you can't do it every

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.940 
proportions and you can't do it every
day<00:05:50.870> so<00:05:51.740> eat<00:05:52.640> healthy<00:05:53.090> and<00:05:53.770> essentially<00:05:54.770> you

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:54.950 
day so eat healthy and essentially you

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:58.030 
day so eat healthy and essentially you
need<00:05:55.070> to<00:05:55.220> burn<00:05:55.570> more<00:05:56.570> calories<00:05:56.840> than<00:05:57.140> you

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:58.040 
need to burn more calories than you

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.460 
need to burn more calories than you
consume<00:05:58.070> that<00:05:58.729> day<00:05:58.970> and<00:05:59.270> then<00:05:59.479> my<00:06:00.200> tip<00:06:00.440> for

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:00.470 
consume that day and then my tip for

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.000 
consume that day and then my tip for
that<00:06:00.860> is<00:06:01.280> walk<00:06:02.240> around<00:06:02.419> a<00:06:02.840> lot<00:06:03.470> of<00:06:03.560> people<00:06:03.830> they

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.010 
that is walk around a lot of people they

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.550 
that is walk around a lot of people they
go<00:06:04.130> to<00:06:04.190> work<00:06:04.430> and<00:06:04.820> then<00:06:04.990> they<00:06:05.990> don't<00:06:06.169> have<00:06:06.320> time

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 
go to work and then they don't have time

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.890 
go to work and then they don't have time
for<00:06:06.740> exercise<00:06:07.010> but<00:06:07.669> maybe<00:06:07.910> at<00:06:08.090> lunch<00:06:08.270> time<00:06:08.630> you

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:08.900 
for exercise but maybe at lunch time you

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.540 
for exercise but maybe at lunch time you
could<00:06:09.050> walk<00:06:09.320> around<00:06:09.470> your<00:06:09.740> building<00:06:10.010> or<00:06:10.370> go

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:10.550 
could walk around your building or go

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.930 
could walk around your building or go
for<00:06:10.790> a<00:06:10.820> little<00:06:11.060> stroll<00:06:11.890> on<00:06:12.890> a<00:06:12.919> break<00:06:13.220> and<00:06:13.490> then

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:13.940 
for a little stroll on a break and then

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.060 
for a little stroll on a break and then
when<00:06:14.479> you<00:06:14.570> come<00:06:14.750> home<00:06:14.960> after<00:06:15.410> dinner<00:06:15.650> just

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:16.070 
when you come home after dinner just

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.100 
when you come home after dinner just
take<00:06:16.400> a<00:06:16.430> walk<00:06:16.729> I<00:06:16.940> mean<00:06:17.120> not<00:06:17.419> a<00:06:17.450> lot<00:06:17.570> of<00:06:17.840> people

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110 
take a walk I mean not a lot of people

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.950 
take a walk I mean not a lot of people
are<00:06:18.370> could<00:06:19.370> do<00:06:19.520> mountain<00:06:19.850> biking<00:06:20.270> and<00:06:20.419> not<00:06:20.930> a

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 
are could do mountain biking and not a

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.450 
are could do mountain biking and not a
lot<00:06:21.169> of<00:06:21.200> people<00:06:21.440> have<00:06:21.590> time<00:06:21.860> for<00:06:22.130> a<00:06:22.160> lot<00:06:22.340> of

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.460 
lot of people have time for a lot of

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.930 
lot of people have time for a lot of
exercise<00:06:22.970> to<00:06:23.390> incorporate<00:06:24.169> it<00:06:24.520> into<00:06:25.520> their

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:25.940 
exercise to incorporate it into their

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.120 
exercise to incorporate it into their
lives<00:06:26.270> but<00:06:26.660> I<00:06:26.870> think<00:06:27.140> most<00:06:27.350> people<00:06:27.710> have<00:06:27.860> time

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.130 
lives but I think most people have time

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.240 
lives but I think most people have time
for<00:06:28.340> walking<00:06:28.760> so<00:06:29.750> essentially<00:06:30.229> walk<00:06:30.890> as<00:06:31.070> much

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.250 
for walking so essentially walk as much

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.880 
for walking so essentially walk as much
as<00:06:31.490> you<00:06:31.610> can<00:06:31.820> there's<00:06:32.690> pedometers<00:06:33.500> that

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:33.890 
as you can there's pedometers that

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:35.399 
as you can there's pedometers that
people<00:06:34.250> buy<00:06:34.400> their

00:06:35.399 --> 00:06:35.409 
people buy their

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:37.139 
people buy their
these<00:06:35.559> little<00:06:35.769> plastic<00:06:36.009> units<00:06:36.610> and<00:06:36.789> accounts

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:37.149 
these little plastic units and accounts

00:06:37.149 --> 00:06:39.089 
these little plastic units and accounts
the<00:06:37.269> amount<00:06:37.479> of<00:06:37.569> steps<00:06:37.779> you<00:06:38.050> do<00:06:38.169> each<00:06:38.349> day<00:06:38.379> try

00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:39.099 
the amount of steps you do each day try

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:41.729 
the amount of steps you do each day try
and<00:06:39.249> go<00:06:39.369> for<00:06:39.399> like<00:06:39.699> 5,000<00:06:40.569> 7,000<00:06:41.319> maybe<00:06:41.469> even

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:41.739
