00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:12.389
 hello if we open this hood 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:19.160
 large solid representative audi 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:22.410
 a8 we will find there rather modest 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:27.000
 small motor volume is only 2 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.910
 liter is not enough for in general is by no means 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.920
 cheap car 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:35.550
 However, if we look in the trunk, we 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.010
 let's find another oddity here 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.079
 on the contrary much less space than under 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.800
 hood part of the trunk eaten but 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:49.079
 this strange kofrom but nameplate hybrid 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:51.210
 explains a lot really after 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.699
 their main competitors let 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.789
 long overdue but the audit does 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.190
 hybrid version of the flagship sedan 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.559
 in prius songs peeking under the hood in 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.930
 the trunk looks almost no 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.840
 differences if we look in the salon we 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.939
 we will find a strange one in place of the tachometer 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.710
 a device that symbolizes u probably 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:15.990
 power consumption of a certain power 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.189
 expressed percentages from 0 to 100 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.270
 and two more meters fuel one symbol 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:22.799
 gas station from another symbol 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.680
 battery 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:29.689
 but the main difference will be clear then 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.960
 when we go we want to undress and 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:33.520
 to blow off 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.280
 in this kingdom 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:41.740
 white leather beige leather their walnut roots 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:45.990
 I want to sit in slippers practically 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:49.319
 I can not hear the sound of the engine but this one 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.579
 tachometer econometer even do not call 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:54.100
 becomes in the position of rarity that is 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:57.000
 all ready our trolley is ready to move 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.880
 light position of the drive and quietly 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.770
 let's go and right here the feeling that 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:08.380
 can only donate an electro mobile or 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:11.170
 then you don't have a hybrid 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.760
 sound engine revs 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.790
 internal combustion machines something like 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.190
 went kind of dragged her and and only 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:22.150
 now you can hear how to get involved 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:24.130
 gasoline engine chick all that happens 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.540
 in the car all work hybrids 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:31.299
 displayed on the display of the system by emma and 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.610
 anyone interested can watch 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.950
 her work 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.690
 orange shows work to control 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.430
 burning everything connected with it 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.560
 green it is natural all that 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.000
 associated with electricity symbolizes 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.000
 look for ecological schemes 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.980
 but fashion ecology 5 can and 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.310
 explain first today 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.080
 purchase of hybrid fashion certainly 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.150
 only good practical 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.040
 little hybrid because all 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.270
 comparative tests show any 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.180
 modern diesel 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:05.140
 with reasonable driving with reasonable 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:08.750
 pedaling is more economical 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:13.010
 Hybrid circuit similar capacity can 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:15.860
 be the creators of audi a8 do the next 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.140
 step and this hybrid is really 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.260
 considering his very small petrol 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.080
 motor is able to finally prove 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.670
 efficiency of the similar scheme 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.739
 it is impossible to understand this now 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.320
 it takes a long and 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:33.080
 comparative test and we will definitely 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.860
 we will spend then when this car appears 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.860
 in Russia 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.080
 autoradio
