00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 a tendency to go on vacation 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:07.620
 that is coming back after they were 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.290
 the attraction of the 50's of 60's 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.370
 the means of transport for example 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.710
 favorite of surfers in states 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.900
 united seeking comfort and something 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.050
 quick to move like that is good today 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.270
 the motorhome reinvent themselves to put together 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.910
 the family and live a unique experience 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.220
 on its wheels its evolution has been 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.840
 skillfully as we are going to see it in the 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.840
 note that I prepare Mauricio Guajardo 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.670
 Y 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:44.100
 I could not exist within my life 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:47.250
 yes without having a vehicle for chÃ©ri and 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.100
 mario will see motorhome involved the start 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.250
 of an adventure not always a story 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.520
 it's always an adventure there's never a 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:00.000
 trip that does not happen to you something that does not happen 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.340
 something he says but if he leaves you it 's a 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.260
 adventure if that 's the fantastic thing 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.619
 here there is not much culture of the Chilean 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.440
 there's a lot of motor home culture me 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.210
 touched by luck let's say this could 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.310
 like the idea immediately to the 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.600
 next week we went to tour 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.460
 as we did with 4000 kilometers it was 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.190
 she who bit him the bug 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.680
 buy yourself a motivated one if that were a 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:29.200
 very special fact and an uncle made 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:34.060
 my mom arrives and tells me if they are coming 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.800
 your uncle from the USA and then I already like if I 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.500
 He said a hannah motorcycle is coming in the house 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.250
 rolling came from there not then it goes 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.260
 entering and I see without tremendous way I 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.360
 the garbage truck arrived I do not know if 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:50.260
 your uncle tell me arriving at the motor home 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:54.100
 and clubs and how it was a place they saw 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:56.229
 We talk a lot here and how 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.799
 and that's when I went up there that I did so 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.200
 tell 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:05.460
 and that was the chosen destination the year of 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:08.580
 her 1982 jewelry she also runs the 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.679
 history that the children have grown 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.290
 dream vacation that make you forget 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.690
 the lease of a house or the installation 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.360
 of a tent but that is not far from 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.910
 problems to have a good few 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.940
 have sometimes had to suffer more from the 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.940
 account 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.800
 as the first problem because I stayed 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.340
 without brake in the first house 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.710
 under the brake pump I did not have 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.600
 liquids the last adventure we have 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:40.569
 last year we broke four 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:43.840
 fair tires for the 1800 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:46.480
 there was no vocalization and nothing comes 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.739
 well and we had to be hitting 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.349
 doors you always have to walk 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:53.230
 hitting and I always found you there 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:55.180
 people who always help you experiences 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.459
 of life that serve of course for 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.010
 create family ties chained to 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.530
 memories that are never forgotten as your 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.290
 first model that they say was made 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.200
 of oak chiles there were only four 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.060
 they tell you that it was a whole crunch and that 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.519
 with a manual generator was very 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:16.769
 complicated that's why they decided to make a 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.769
 change that you will already know 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.390
 and that 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.600
 in Spain it is known as caravan 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:29.890
 Ecuador calls it mobile home and in Chile- 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:32.330
 his name is motor home was created in 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.150
 1931 by the German brand 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.010
 detlef its biggest boom was in the decade 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.380
 of 40 when artists 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.690
 Americans used it to 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.140
 stay in a certain place at low 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.140
 cost 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:48.800
 with it not only were they not with the 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.810
 comfort that was inside it but 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.030
 that also with the ease of moving 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.940
 fast if the giant waves 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.550
 the first models varied from the place 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.010
 in appearing they had only one bed and one 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:03.740
 cooks all the only environment that 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.750
 allowed to also enjoy life at 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.390
 fresh air 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.700
 over time modernity has done 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.730
 that the motorhome or mobile homes 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:17.350
 have new bathroom implementations 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.350
 dining room and more environments 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.140
 good engine 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.710
 all communities that do not want 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:28.080
 these enclosures but the space now that 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.360
 it's called is light outs that we do not 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.030
 facilitates he gives us more space 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.510
 we have a full kitchen microwave 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.660
 Bell 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:40.090
 a refrigerator but they have not stayed 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.310
 in that also new ones have been created 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.720
 models that allow comfort and 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:48.420
 innovation of these true relics 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:52.130
 we can see here that we have a 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:55.350
 large dining room a living kitchen 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:57.810
 dishwasher we have space to be able 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:01.440
 cook and save and the truth that this 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.840
 the great importance of 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.880
 benefit is that to save you an octopus 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.890
 as well as show previously just 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.450
 we were on the car we could not 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.820
 account for the large dimensions 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:14.520
 which has finally been reduced to 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.920
 what we see here and that finally is 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.570
 the great comfort that the 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.030
 ease of handling the ease of 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.490
 can save during the year but if 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:26.190
 he has never climbed one of these here 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.020
 we teach the basics by taking 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.810
 note that some work with 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.300
 battery and others directly with plates 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.850
 solar without which the battery makes 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.680
 all the houses work and the only thing that 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.630
 it works being plugged into the air 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.540
 conditioning the microwave and the 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:45.849
 plugs all the rest of the micro house the 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:49.179
 kitchen and refrigerator 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:51.189
 are you do then that work all the 

00:05:49.179 --> 00:05:53.409
 day with the auxiliary battery can be 

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:55.749
 lease or buy but if you do not have 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:58.599
 time or money to go out in a house 

00:05:55.749 --> 00:06:02.550
 rolling rappelling there is a place where 

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:02.550
 they await us with everything ready and prepared 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:08.960
 the idea is born by my dad who is 

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:10.789
 German descendant when he left with the 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.430
 camping always wanted to have houses 

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:16.249
 rolling like in German and is part in 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:19.249
 this moment of 35 houses we have 

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:21.589
 installed in the campsite when here 

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:24.199
 us when to come install a house 

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:26.210
 rolling or something more stable and we can 

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:28.819
 leave everything ready here when the idea is 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:33.229
 that has the comforts with its light 

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:36.589
 water is all that influences the person 

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:37.969
 who calls 25 years here and they really go 

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:41.479
 to other places they come back because the 

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:43.490
 tranquility the constant coming and going of 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:46.509
 child that security for this is very 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:49.930
 important then boy has grown up here 

00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:52.999
 we found that coming here is a place 

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:55.069
 very important but let's go back to the 

00:06:52.999 --> 00:06:56.960
 family that we present to you at the beginning 

00:06:55.069 --> 00:06:59.479
 and how happy they told us about their 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:02.120
 vacation in a motorhome well 

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:04.520
 They will show us their new acquisition with 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.590
 the one that they hope to travel south of china 

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.570
 for 

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:09.730
 I have spoken with many people who have 

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:11.470
 to do it during a passion because you 

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:14.290
 you go with a hotel this is a hotel 5 

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:17.500
 Stars that you wear for any 

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:19.330
 side now in Chile difficult the brand 

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:22.930
 German detlef that made them by 

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:25.950
 First time you have your 2014 models 

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.950
 this is the train 

00:07:27.409 --> 00:07:31.120
 and the last of his projects the globe 

00:07:29.989 --> 00:07:34.380
 form 

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.380
 it's good 

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:40.030
 just and devotions in a way 

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:42.490
 other than living the holidays for 

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:45.460
 nostalgic and new adventurers a 

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:47.710
 motor home never old fashioned like 

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:50.020
 for the zÃ¡rate dangers that are no longer 

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:52.990
 seven but nine with her two grandchildren 

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:55.810
 although they tell us they already made their 

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:57.790
 first trip which is likely to 

00:07:55.810 --> 00:08:00.370
 also strengthen the love for 

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:05.730
 family and the unforgettable summers that 

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:05.730
 Only one mobile home can deliver
