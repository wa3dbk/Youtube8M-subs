00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:16.949
 So Simon plays from idev bodybuilding 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.350
 de yesterday I have you have a video 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.910
 what the topic muscle hangover tells what 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.930
 is actually as a muscle cat as 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.550
 he arises 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.110
 and in the end, then how does it come about? 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.730
 not with an overacidification 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.010
 The Muscular Cat has nothing to do 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.399
 it does not come to a hyperacidity it 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.590
 just does not come to the rise of 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:36.059
 lactate levels in the muscle and yes that is 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.649
 therefore certainly know about it and 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.780
 the next time you tell quark 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.730
 will then just say she is just 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.530
 not there is no muscle and 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.960
 Muscular hangover is not caused by too much 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.440
 lactic acid in the muscle and so on and 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.600
 immediately 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.210
 yes we also have some others 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.440
 questions about the muscle hangover explained 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.910
 what I want now but completely 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.500
 I also found interesting from you 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.579
 read again in the comments like 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.010
 does it look like with such a kind 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.260
 Therapy with sauna or sauna 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.379
 unwell locally then such a heat pillow 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.360
 may place these cherry stone pillows where 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.640
 one should be a pillow with something 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.899
 any cherry-tree in 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.400
 make the microwave and then bring it 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:12.840
 out and the cherry pits hold the 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.030
 heat is very good you can have 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.040
 and where they put it or so too 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.330
 go to sleep with the part is soooo 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.830
 of course a very good thing 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.110
 to promote blood circulation 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.479
 Circulation is of course always something 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.950
 very important is just the muscle cat 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.990
 maybe a little bit eventually 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.400
 relieve can feel in his pain 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.590
 of course has something with this more 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.240
 To do the music as the perfect 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.159
 pain somewhere in the brain 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.020
 transport and you signal that 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.729
 hurts so there you can of course with 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.170
 still work very well against working though 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.090
 what you can not do is the one 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.570
 Muscle hangover with heat is somehow gone 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.280
 to blow or you can hurt 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.689
 but relieve the muscle hangover with it 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.610
 cure somehow faster 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.960
 Nonetheless, that would be serious 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.460
 has muscle and is also 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.530
 really stops and hurts properly and 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.119
 you also notice it works 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.530
 not that should be such a nice 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.390
 hot tub that should maybe 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.100
 go to the sauna or just like that 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.229
 cherry stone cushions take the cost 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.509
 Not much there are then cherry pits 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.159
 In such a fabric pillow in it makes you 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.019
 in the microwave and that depends very nicely 

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:11.879
 Of course, the heat is there too 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:12.310
 even in high-tech form here so 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.989
 represents 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.340
 you plug in the socket and then 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.360
 is he going to pillow that long why? 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.530
 I also have that one can 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.280
 so wonderful over the neck 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.110
 if you have muscle pain, yes 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.910
 very important again how it looks now 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.319
 wanted out with the nutrients on it 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.630
 I now enter into concrete in this 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.489
 video so nutrient intake after the 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.260
 training if the muscle just right 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.910
 mature and the muscle too 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.069
 it burns that feeling that 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.660
 Muscle Cat has for me are for it 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.970
 amino acids from experience actually 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.610
 very important for one, the three bcaa 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.500
 amino acids berlin and iso people 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.709
 draw and ultimately glutamine 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.830
 all I'm doing in the form of capsules 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.930
 I have the mpc akp megatrends here 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.850
 just as for bleeding mini league cups the 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.459
 I'll just take it after the training 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.780
 I take four pieces of each and 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.310
 then I can get up somewhere eventually 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.590
 even say okay now i have this 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.590
 sufficient amino acids are sufficient 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.150
 have deficiencies in the pool in the blood train it 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.519
 of course still such a thing if 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.019
 one has an idea of 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.160
 diet supplements are heard 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.930
 probably the four most important 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.510
 amino acids that you as an athlete 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.549
 with special care takes with himself 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.230
 I can recommend this very 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.609
 capsule shape is of course very comfortable 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.560
 I'm really on it right now 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:26.380
 I think a lot of quality too 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.819
 so here's the league cups this one 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.459
 great and the other here too 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.780
 glutamine tabs I'll link that up 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.819
 under help in this video that is 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.500
 simply from my point of view, this makes sense 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:39.640
 nutrients after a serious 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.440
 Training fall tell these four 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.120
 amino acids become the muscle hangover 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.739
 do not relieve faster 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.840
 they will not take care of that 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.370
 Muscle hangover no longer hurts or how 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.470
 goes faster but it has 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.359
 just something with the nutrient supply too 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.639
 Do the muscle that is injured 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:56.889
 muscle is in a process of growth 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:58.450
 also clearly the muscle grows in the 

00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:00.040
 serious muscle cat is the 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.720
 growth process certainly first 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.519
 not in the form as at 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.260
 a slight muscle hangover where the muscle 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.519
 actually growing 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.930
 can focus on priority and not 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:09.850
 first of all has to deal with itself 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.650
 Let's be clear on all this 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.740
 those who think a heavy one 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.470
 muscle would be 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.640
 which is especially great so important 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.989
 I just think that one in the 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.850
 area then on the nutrient supply 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.680
 Pay attention that you just look that one 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.240
 actually healthy is that you look 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.430
 but also lean quark makes but also 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.760
 just these four important amino acids 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.620
 here once the bca it and low blood for 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.210
 me really important and just this 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.190
 Of course, that's the big capsule shape 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.700
 Convenient to take in and in the self 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.510
 actually out of the blister and the 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.980
 you can swallow 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.360
 I 've shown that before 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.160
 that I swallow these big capsules 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.690
 but who can do that similar 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.200
 make the capsule on it you can even 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.940
 rotate 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.160
 there you can open the capsule 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.930
 dissolve in the juice or water and 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.430
 Ultimately then the powder 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.200
 do not even consume it 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.830
 problem 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.580
 but the capsule is gone and I can 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.470
 also in berlin 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.030
 Yes, I can recommend that he is there 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.260
 really pay attention to that 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:03.800
 training as being especially healthy too 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.050
 feed 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.310
 well of course carbohydrates on 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.750
 fast carbohydrates with the 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.590
 glycogen stores another col 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.420
 premiered 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.100
 but also these four amino acids 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:15.170
 all those who say that now 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.460
 Do not want to drink postberg outtake 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.600
 I do not know why because I have the 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.640
 somehow not want to take with you 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.780
 to the gym or from which 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.980
 I always start like that now 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.630
 can not understand and needs 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.950
 that's just important to yourself 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.660
 then maybe the banana snaps and 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.610
 but still with this one 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:31.160
 amino acid works because ultimately 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.170
 existing muscles of egg white and 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.640
 Egg white from amino acids so that must 

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:36.740
 Just be clear that this is a whole 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.870
 plays an important role and for me and 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.090
 I can only advise women to anyone like that 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.980
 topic muscle hangover I guess that one 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.540
 relatively detailed you know 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.370
 now that muscle- kelly kelly 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.990
 Acidification is very important again 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.120
 in really all of them tell you there 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.400
 the quark from 20 years ago still 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.720
 to talk 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.010
 Otherwise, as I said, muscle soreness should 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.500
 to cure and so a player 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:58.940
 In any case, avoid muscle ache so 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.320
 See you in the next video many 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.320
 greetings from your simon
