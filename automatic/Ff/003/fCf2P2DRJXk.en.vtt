00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.610 
to talk to you today about riffs and
specifically<00:01:03.120> using<00:01:03.480> intervals<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:04.140> fourths

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:04.620 
specifically using intervals of fourths

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.320 
specifically using intervals of fourths
and<00:01:04.770> fifths<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.640> come<00:01:05.820> up<00:01:05.940> with<00:01:06.090> interesting

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
and fifths to come up with interesting

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.860 
and fifths to come up with interesting
sounds<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.470> hooky<00:01:08.250> riffs<00:01:08.660> remember<00:01:09.660> that<00:01:09.840> a

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:09.870 
sounds and hooky riffs remember that a

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.260 
sounds and hooky riffs remember that a
riff<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.620> musical<00:01:11.400> hook<00:01:11.700> it's<00:01:11.910> going<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.150> be

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
riff is a musical hook it's going to be

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.380 
riff is a musical hook it's going to be
often<00:01:12.690> the<00:01:12.810> first<00:01:13.020> thing<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.470> listener<00:01:13.860> hears

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
often the first thing the listener hears

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.550 
often the first thing the listener hears
so<00:01:15.390> we<00:01:15.510> want<00:01:15.690> to<00:01:15.780> make<00:01:15.900> sure<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.320> it's<00:01:16.470> gonna

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
so we want to make sure that it's gonna

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.560 
so we want to make sure that it's gonna
be<00:01:16.770> something<00:01:17.190> that<00:01:17.220> grabs<00:01:17.760> people<00:01:18.270> right

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
be something that grabs people right

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.090 
be something that grabs people right
from<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.900> get-go<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.590> course<00:01:19.770> it's<00:01:19.920> also

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
from the get-go and of course it's also

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.280 
from the get-go and of course it's also
something<00:01:20.520> that's<00:01:20.790> likely<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.240> recur<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:22.080> come

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
something that's likely to recur to come

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.680 
something that's likely to recur to come
back<00:01:22.530> later<00:01:22.830> on<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:23.190> the<00:01:23.280> song<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.450> don't

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
back later on in the song so you don't

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.150 
back later on in the song so you don't
want<00:01:24.810> them<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.050> be<00:01:25.170> bored<00:01:25.410> when<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.740> comes<00:01:25.950> back

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
want them to be bored when it comes back

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.520 
want them to be bored when it comes back
so<00:01:26.970> it's<00:01:27.120> got<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.390> have<00:01:27.510> a<00:01:27.540> strong<00:01:27.930> rhythmic

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
so it's got to have a strong rhythmic

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.620 
so it's got to have a strong rhythmic
aspect<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.370> it<00:01:29.400> it's<00:01:29.970> got<00:01:30.120> to<00:01:30.150> have<00:01:30.330> a<00:01:30.360> strong

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
aspect to it it's got to have a strong

aspect to it it's got to have a strong
melodic<00:01:31.229> aspect<00:01:31.800> to<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.160> and<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.490> course<00:01:32.700> it

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
melodic aspect to it and of course it

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.550 
melodic aspect to it and of course it
has<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.000> have<00:01:33.300> great<00:01:33.600> tone<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.140> great<00:01:34.290> feel

has to have great tone and great feel
and<00:01:34.830> all<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:35.040> those<00:01:35.190> things<00:01:35.780> just<00:01:36.780> remember

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
and all of those things just remember

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.410 
and all of those things just remember
that<00:01:37.290> when<00:01:37.440> it<00:01:37.470> comes<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:38.180> composition<00:01:39.180> in

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
that when it comes to composition in

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.660 
that when it comes to composition in
music<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.350> ideas<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.920> repetition<00:01:41.550> and

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
music the ideas of repetition and

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.280 
music the ideas of repetition and
variation<00:01:41.760> in<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.479> really<00:01:42.750> important

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
variation in a really important

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.920 
variation in a really important
repetition<00:01:44.160> creates<00:01:44.450> familiarity<00:01:45.450> in<00:01:45.600> form

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
repetition creates familiarity in form

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.280 
repetition creates familiarity in form
and<00:01:46.550> variation<00:01:47.550> creates<00:01:47.910> interest<00:01:48.360> so

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
and variation creates interest so

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.620 
and variation creates interest so
talking<00:01:50.220> about<00:01:50.280> fourths<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:50.910> fifths<00:01:51.000> for

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
talking about fourths and fifths for

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.820 
talking about fourths and fifths for
those<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.900> you<00:01:51.990> who<00:01:52.110> may<00:01:52.229> not<00:01:52.380> be<00:01:52.440> as<00:01:52.650> familiar

those of you who may not be as familiar

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.609 
those of you who may not be as familiar
with<00:01:53.100> music<00:01:53.580> theory<00:01:53.970> it's<00:01:54.690> as<00:01:54.900> simple<00:01:55.080> as<00:01:55.350> this

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
with music theory it's as simple as this

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:02.620 
with music theory it's as simple as this
if<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.280> take<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.550> note<00:01:57.229> and<00:01:58.229> play<00:01:58.440> a<00:01:58.530> scale

the distance between note 1 2 3 4 5 and
note<00:02:08.690> 5<00:02:09.020> is<00:02:09.470> called<00:02:09.920> a<00:02:10.039> fifth<00:02:10.280> for<00:02:11.209> a<00:02:11.239> perfect

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
note 5 is called a fifth for a perfect

note 5 is called a fifth for a perfect
fifth<00:02:11.900> same<00:02:12.560> idea<00:02:12.920> note<00:02:13.280> 1<00:02:13.550> 2<00:02:13.790> Note<00:02:13.940> 4<00:02:14.270> and<00:02:18.250> they

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
this is probably pretty familiar to you

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.559 
this is probably pretty familiar to you
that<00:02:23.390> two<00:02:23.630> finger<00:02:24.080> index<00:02:24.620> ring<00:02:25.010> power<00:02:25.580> chord

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.550 

and<00:02:29.980> this<00:02:30.980> one<00:02:31.190> may<00:02:31.340> be<00:02:31.400> also<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:32.840> flat<00:02:33.080> finger

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
and this one may be also the flat finger

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:39.400 
and this one may be also the flat finger
covering<00:02:33.800> two<00:02:34.220> adjacent<00:02:34.520> strings<00:02:38.260> but<00:02:39.260> when

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
covering two adjacent strings but when

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.960 
covering two adjacent strings but when
you<00:02:39.530> start<00:02:39.769> combining<00:02:39.980> them<00:02:40.459> things<00:02:40.730> get

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
you start combining them things get

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:56.559 
you start combining them things get
really<00:02:41.150> interesting

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.229 

the<00:02:57.569> palette<00:02:58.049> just<00:02:58.080> broadens<00:02:58.769> immediately<00:02:59.610> so

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
the palette just broadens immediately so

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:01.910 
the palette just broadens immediately so
I<00:03:00.269> want<00:03:00.629> to<00:03:00.690> point<00:03:00.900> out<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.500> primary

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
I want to point out the primary

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.820 
I want to point out the primary
fingerings<00:03:02.730> 4/5<00:03:03.690> and<00:03:03.840> fourths<00:03:04.170> across<00:03:04.620> the

neck the movable two finger I just
discussed<00:03:08.299> and<00:03:09.299> the<00:03:09.870> flat<00:03:10.110> finger<00:03:10.530> and<00:03:10.890> this

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
discussed and the flat finger and this

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:22.039 
discussed and the flat finger and this
works<00:03:11.790> on<00:03:12.030> 6<00:03:12.450> 5<00:03:14.030> 5<00:03:15.030> 4<00:03:15.360> 4<00:03:17.090> 3<00:03:20.060> now<00:03:21.060> we<00:03:21.120> get<00:03:21.360> to<00:03:21.540> 3<00:03:21.780> 2

don't get used as much and there's so

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.000 
don't get used as much and there's so
much<00:03:57.690> cool<00:03:57.960> stuff<00:03:58.290> that<00:03:58.320> can<00:03:58.620> come<00:03:58.830> out<00:03:58.980> of

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
much cool stuff that can come out of

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:19.599 
much cool stuff that can come out of
that

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.719 

and<00:04:20.079> we<00:04:21.079> can<00:04:21.289> totally<00:04:21.439> change<00:04:21.889> the<00:04:22.129> character

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
and we can totally change the character

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:24.159 
and we can totally change the character
of<00:04:22.879> a<00:04:22.970> riff<00:04:23.150> just<00:04:23.419> by<00:04:23.539> moving<00:04:23.780> it<00:04:23.990> to<00:04:24.139> a

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
of a riff just by moving it to a

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.140 
of a riff just by moving it to a
different<00:04:24.379> place<00:04:24.680> something<00:04:25.580> that<00:04:25.819> sounds

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
different place something that sounds

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:33.429 
different place something that sounds
one<00:04:26.389> way<00:04:26.569> down<00:04:26.840> here<00:04:32.199> has<00:04:33.199> a<00:04:33.229> different

00:04:33.429 --> 00:04:33.439 
one way down here has a different

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:40.240 
one way down here has a different
feeling<00:04:34.039> here<00:04:38.379> might<00:04:39.379> completely<00:04:39.740> change<00:04:39.860> the

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
feeling here might completely change the

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:48.119 
feeling here might completely change the
song<00:04:40.490> maybe<00:04:40.939> you<00:04:41.120> start<00:04:41.419> off

00:04:48.119 --> 00:04:48.129 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:56.529 

and<00:04:49.129> then<00:04:49.280> when<00:04:49.400> you<00:04:49.490> move<00:04:49.639> down<00:04:55.449> creates<00:04:56.449> a

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:56.539 
and then when you move down creates a

00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:59.439 
and then when you move down creates a
tremendous<00:04:56.810> amount<00:04:57.560> of<00:04:57.710> power<00:04:57.970> so<00:04:58.970> I'm<00:04:59.240> just

00:04:59.439 --> 00:04:59.449 
tremendous amount of power so I'm just

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:00.999 
tremendous amount of power so I'm just
gonna<00:04:59.599> new<00:04:59.840> to<00:04:59.990> a<00:05:00.020> little<00:05:00.349> bit<00:05:00.500> with<00:05:00.650> fourths

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:01.009 
gonna new to a little bit with fourths

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:29.010 
gonna new to a little bit with fourths
and<00:05:01.129> fifths

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.740 

and<00:05:29.950> of<00:05:30.220> course<00:05:30.430> that's<00:05:30.670> just<00:05:30.820> you<00:05:31.420> know<00:05:31.450> a

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
and of course that's just you know a

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.110 
and of course that's just you know a
little<00:05:32.170> bit<00:05:32.380> of<00:05:32.530> messing<00:05:32.710> around<00:05:32.920> but<00:05:33.460> you<00:05:33.850> see

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
little bit of messing around but you see

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.790 
little bit of messing around but you see
how<00:05:34.330> there's<00:05:34.630> cool<00:05:34.870> things<00:05:35.230> that<00:05:35.320> can<00:05:35.590> happen

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
how there's cool things that can happen

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.830 
how there's cool things that can happen
when<00:05:36.340> you<00:05:36.400> start<00:05:36.730> adding<00:05:36.910> different<00:05:37.240> rhythms

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 
when you start adding different rhythms

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.460 
when you start adding different rhythms
then<00:05:38.650> stuff<00:05:39.550> we<00:05:39.760> associate<00:05:40.390> primarily<00:05:41.200> with

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 
then stuff we associate primarily with

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:49.170 
then stuff we associate primarily with
harder<00:05:41.830> rock<00:05:46.830> that's<00:05:47.830> a<00:05:47.980> rhythmic<00:05:48.370> thing<00:05:48.400> but

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
harder rock that's a rhythmic thing but

00:05:49.180 --> 00:06:21.410 
harder rock that's a rhythmic thing but
if<00:05:49.300> you<00:06:07.680> same<00:06:08.680> sound<00:06:09.070> different<00:06:09.820> feeling

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:21.420 

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.240 

could<00:06:22.420> be<00:06:22.510> a<00:06:22.540> whole<00:06:22.720> different<00:06:22.900> song<00:06:23.290> so

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.250 
could be a whole different song so

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.310 
could be a whole different song so
there's<00:06:24.640> so<00:06:24.940> much<00:06:25.120> to<00:06:25.180> play<00:06:25.540> with<00:06:25.780> here<00:06:26.080> so

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:26.320 
there's so much to play with here so

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.030 
there's so much to play with here so
just<00:06:26.530> start<00:06:26.740> experimenting<00:06:27.870> to<00:06:28.870> patterns<00:06:29.350> or

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:30.040 
just start experimenting to patterns or

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:40.499 
just start experimenting to patterns or
rather<00:06:30.250> to<00:06:30.520> fingerings
