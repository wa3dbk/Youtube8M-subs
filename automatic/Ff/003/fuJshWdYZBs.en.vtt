00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:09.910 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.810 

the<00:01:10.910> last<00:01:11.180> part<00:01:11.450> of<00:01:11.960> part<00:01:12.530> 5<00:01:12.800> you<00:01:13.280> can<00:01:13.490> change

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
the last part of part 5 you can change

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.890 
the last part of part 5 you can change
it<00:01:14.000> to<00:01:14.950> netherrack<00:01:15.950> and<00:01:16.460> basically<00:01:17.450> you<00:01:17.720> can

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
it to netherrack and basically you can

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.750 
it to netherrack and basically you can
just<00:01:18.080> feel<00:01:18.290> this<00:01:18.500> power<00:01:18.770> out<00:01:19.040> of<00:01:19.070> any<00:01:19.370> block

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.760 
just feel this power out of any block

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.360 
just feel this power out of any block
depending<00:01:20.360> on<00:01:20.360> the<00:01:20.630> file<00:01:20.840> so<00:01:21.680> that's<00:01:21.890> an<00:01:22.040> idea

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370 
depending on the file so that's an idea

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.090 
depending on the file so that's an idea
for<00:01:22.700> you<00:01:23.060> to<00:01:23.210> do<00:01:23.390> another<00:01:24.229> idea<00:01:24.740> that<00:01:24.979> was

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
for you to do another idea that was

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.150 
for you to do another idea that was
suggested<00:01:25.640> to<00:01:25.670> me<00:01:25.910> was<00:01:27.010> turning<00:01:28.010> the

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160 
suggested to me was turning the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.570 
suggested to me was turning the
watchtowers<00:01:29.140> into<00:01:30.140> the<00:01:30.410> corners<00:01:30.979> of<00:01:31.220> the

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
watchtowers into the corners of the

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.450 
watchtowers into the corners of the
simple<00:01:32.000> castle<00:01:32.540> so<00:01:33.110> that<00:01:33.380> means<00:01:33.740> you

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
simple castle so that means you

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.060 
simple castle so that means you
basically<00:01:34.670> take<00:01:35.330> this<00:01:35.720> tower<00:01:36.080> right<00:01:36.470> here<00:01:36.890> and

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
basically take this tower right here and

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.210 
basically take this tower right here and
turn<00:01:37.940> it<00:01:38.119> into<00:01:38.330> one<00:01:38.720> of<00:01:38.750> those<00:01:39.110> and<00:01:39.470> basically

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
turn it into one of those and basically

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.710 
turn it into one of those and basically
make<00:01:40.550> this<00:01:40.729> humongous<00:01:41.690> epic<00:01:42.369> watchtower<00:01:43.720> so

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
make this humongous epic watchtower so

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.600

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
so yeah there's also an idea that I had

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.960 
so yeah there's also an idea that I had
was<00:02:10.729> why<00:02:11.480> don't<00:02:12.010> another<00:02:13.010> extra<00:02:13.459> thing<00:02:13.610> you

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
can do is you go into this floor or into

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.259 
can do is you go into this floor or into
a<00:02:17.209> world<00:02:17.660> and<00:02:17.959> like<00:02:18.620> maybe<00:02:18.920> right<00:02:19.370> here<00:02:19.400> you

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
a world and like maybe right here you

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.650 
a world and like maybe right here you
fill<00:02:20.600> in<00:02:20.810> three<00:02:21.350> blocks<00:02:21.680> of<00:02:21.950> grass<00:02:22.310> to<00:02:22.670> build<00:02:23.540> a

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
fill in three blocks of grass to build a

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.180 
fill in three blocks of grass to build a
walkway<00:02:23.900> just<00:02:24.350> like<00:02:24.500> how<00:02:24.620> we<00:02:24.650> put<00:02:24.980> through

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
walkway just like how we put through

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.070 
walkway just like how we put through
here<00:02:25.459> you<00:02:25.850> put<00:02:26.090> three<00:02:26.269> right<00:02:26.660> in<00:02:26.810> the<00:02:26.900> middle

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
here you put three right in the middle

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.320 
here you put three right in the middle
here<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:27.590> basically<00:02:28.280> then<00:02:28.970> you<00:02:29.120> build

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
here and basically then you build

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.750 
here and basically then you build
cobblestone<00:02:30.230> around<00:02:30.650> and<00:02:30.950> you<00:02:31.459> can<00:02:31.580> make<00:02:31.730> a

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
cobblestone around and you can make a

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.850 
cobblestone around and you can make a
little<00:02:32.060> bedroom<00:02:32.420> for<00:02:32.660> yourself<00:02:33.019> either<00:02:33.650> that

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
little bedroom for yourself either that

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.789 
little bedroom for yourself either that
or<00:02:34.070> you<00:02:34.489> could<00:02:34.670> dig<00:02:34.880> underneath<00:02:35.239> and<00:02:35.799> possibly

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
or you could dig underneath and possibly

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.729 
or you could dig underneath and possibly
put<00:02:37.160> entrance<00:02:38.000> for<00:02:38.269> a<00:02:38.330> minecart<00:02:38.900> station<00:02:39.530> or

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
put entrance for a minecart station or
