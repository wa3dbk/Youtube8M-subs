00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.420
 following the side of 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.270
 past them 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:17.740
 back a piece written by together 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:19.570
 shell sauce comes from smoked 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.349
 that is about it in a certain way 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.910
 my company 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:23.770
 apparently the 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:28.119
 reporter by a number of colleagues 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:30.250
 from mine approached oneself clouds 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.970
 why there is still a clog in the cafÃ© 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.970
 is smoked 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.300
 apparently my colleagues don't have that 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.250
 well understood 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.629
 and I actually give an explanation today 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.629
 why that is still there 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.170
 I have been in letter since last June 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:51.400
 tori them with the first and the second 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:53.019
 room where I then told it 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.150
 actually it was not even possible 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:56.589
 smoking ban 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.989
 also because we won that law sooner 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:03.150
 then I had my position in you 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.150
 says ok if I have the smoking ban 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.590
 is actually asking the smoking ban 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.330
 just be maintained again 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.030
 maintained and if not 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.530
 is maintained then I would like one 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.670
 compensation for my company 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:21.219
 because the smoking ban is so great 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.140
 problem is within a small company that 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:25.420
 has no smoking room and that the people 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.109
 really outside must later also on which 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.820
 they are not going to come more than the people 

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:33.340
 they then go to a place where they do 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.100
 can cook or go home or to one 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.920
 place of a smoking room liz 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.689
 so I stand with my back to the wall 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.420
 how it is doing 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:45.850
 It is true that our government actually 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.530
 does not return smoking but neither does it 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.799
 compensation 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.109
 So ultimately continues to smoke because 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:55.299
 there at the moment 

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:58.030
 would be a solution from a legal perspective 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:00.880
 because it is not the intention 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.009
 when I am wearing a dickface for 33 years 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.140
 finally home with zero center 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.969
 to go and think that has got it 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.380
 very annoying also because it 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:10.780
 not just for me but also for 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.720
 many other colleagues and retirement 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.090
 is being eaten and that is the reason 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.640
 I know I thought against the ship 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.310
 but the essence is quite the 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.069
 catering drink broken 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.840
 eventually a next year or 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.190
 two years walk three yes how on the 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.569
 terraces affected 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.150
 then mine can not be smoked there 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.010
 now you see in towns in villages 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.590
 other people on terraces with a lamp 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.040
 with this and then there is already about it 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.940
 so that means that togetherness 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:44.250
 social place ditto the hospitality industry is complete 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.260
 replaced by this government can 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.880
 that the intention would be that i got it 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.140
 very unfortunate that you are so through the 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.630
 cooperation that is always a good thing 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.250
 done is now having the openness to 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.620
 to ask my why 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.930
 here well there is also until the reasons 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.140
 pure necessity 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:07.170
 so this following the piece 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.549
 in the voice and I hope we have colleagues 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.230
 here in etten-leur 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:13.890
 that I have explained enough now 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.900
 why do I still enforce the smoking ban 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.769
 it did a wonderfully clear reason 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.150
 and the reasons is your router's survival and 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:23.220
 nothing else 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.900
 I don't want a bad word about it 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.880
 someone else against this should be alone 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.400
 survive and I have an offer 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.739
 no chance and this year it will be one 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.700
 going out so this is my this is 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.700
 my answer then
