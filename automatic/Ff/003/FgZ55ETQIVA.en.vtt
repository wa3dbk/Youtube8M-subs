00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.769
 Hey, this is Shadow Fighter video. It's the first time I've ever used a microphone . 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:16.470
 It was updated recently and the story after Shogun was updated like this 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:20.430
 May is now caught by Titan, and to pass through that door, 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.170
 The story has been updated in such a way that we need to clear up the charge again. 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.279
 It's the same. 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:30.660
 This video is a rematch with Lynns. 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:34.950
 Now, if you have equipment like this , it's all set with 39 level equipment. 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:40.260
 Upgrade to upgrade the pitching yoreotge ditch armor step 3 if: 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:45.059
 I will . I will proceed with the fight. 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:50.219
 42 If the video game is like its own installment, it's a lot to see foreigners 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:56.239
 When the game begins, many people like Mike does not use installment 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.239
 Let's try to go ahead and make a sound by adding the subtitles.

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:31.139
 I was cleared and wounded. 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:36.749
 In the case of a coin, the unit changed. 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:40.400
 You clear up and talk to Lyngs like that. 

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:40.400
 So come'm a little awkward 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:50.670
 4 Once I entered b, I got a 30-minute rap and a puck 

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:57.320
 If there are two I 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:57.320
 I chose the Jogger Crust, which reduces damage when I'm on the ground. 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:08.410
 Now I come in this chapter There are several content like this one 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:08.410
 I will clear it and raise the additional shape again when it is at the bottom and 9th frame.
