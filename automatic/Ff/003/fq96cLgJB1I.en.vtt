00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:06.399
 hello everyone welcome to a new 

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:09.190
 tutorial in this opportunity I'm going to 

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:14.800
 show how to implement a movement 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:17.050
 circulate in game maker 8.1 but also 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:20.279
 they will be able to follow this tutorial if 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:24.749
 they are using that game maker studio or 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:27.609
 versions under 15 may care 8.1 

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:30.130
 good as I told you in this opportunity 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:32.829
 I'm going to show you how to implement a 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.230
 circular movement that is very useful 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:37.390
 in many games and it is something that is 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.269
 seen in infinity of games we are going to 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.640
 start creating a sprite here I already 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:46.570
 I have one that I was drawing as the 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.440
 it's a face we load it and we're going to give it 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:53.370
 a name 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:56.519
 spr bow I'm going to put it to center 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.129
 the origin presses by clicking on the 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:02.670
 center button and let's distill the 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.610
 precise collision check option already 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.180
 we have our sprite and now we are going to 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.730
 create the object 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.110
 here we have our object we are going to 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:19.070
 give it a name or bj voice and we're going to 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:22.130
 assign the previously created sprite and 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:25.610
 Now we are ready to 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:29.930
 start adding the events we're going to 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:32.840
 start by adding a create event a 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.630
 create event to initialize variables 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.840
 more than anything inside this event 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.660
 we add the action executive code or 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.920
 execute code and here we are going to create 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:48.729
 these two variables first angle d 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:51.130
 angle in Spanish we start it at zero 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:54.189
 Here we have a bad line written in English 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.340
 that comes to mean length and what 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:59.470
 initialize with a value of 4 then 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.470
 let's see well the meaning of these 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:06.460
 variables so do not worry let's go 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:10.330
 to add a step event and inside it 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:13.300
 we add another action 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:17.760
 execute code and here we are going to do what 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:23.890
 next in the horizontal coordinate x 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:27.610
 let's use the cosine function 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:30.180
 cosine of the angle and obviously for the 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.709
 coordinate and we're going to use the function 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.950
 sine this then I'll explain it well 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:39.130
 this wheat trigonometry is very basic 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.530
 but if they do not remember it in others 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:45.730
 tutorials I'll explain it with more 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:50.260
 good detail we make angle cosine 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:53.020
 by the length for the xy coordinate 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:57.250
 sine of the angle by length for the 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:03:01.530
 coordinate i but this value we have it 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.530
 that increase and that we do 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.110
 putting more 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.290
 with the operator more equal 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:13.470
 with this formula we are going to achieve that 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:18.000
 circular movement that we are looking for 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:20.730
 we're already going to see it, so 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.120
 well now it's just to create a room in 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:27.700
 our project and add the object that 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:32.690
 we create our run 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:37.250
 and good now it only remains to prove it 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:42.830
 to see what happens and it does not work to see that 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:45.800
 I forgot this is fine I forgot 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.510
 something important I forgot to increase 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.790
 the angle 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:53.329
 I have to increase the angle I'm going to 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:57.319
 put a small value 0 1 and good now 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:04:00.930
 should work and if indeed there 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:03.900
 we are seeing how the objects move 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.379
 in a circular form but let's see it 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.340
 best 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:07.340
 in full screen 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:14.490
 and there we see it again a movement 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:17.570
 circular to the object using 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.570
 trigonometric functions 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:24.240
 very very basic but well let's see if 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:27.890
 we can do this a little more 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:32.130
 interesting I'm going to add new 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:33.600
 instances of the same object within the 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.450
 room 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.510
 and let's see now what happens and here 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:42.140
 we see the three objects moving in 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:45.180
 circular shape but perfectly 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:47.880
 synchronized and really I do not want 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:51.840
 that because it looks like too perfect 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:54.830
 I would like to add some variation to 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:58.620
 movement so for that I'm going to 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:02.810
 initialize the angle variable with a 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:06.750
 random value and for that I'm going to use 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:08.900
 the function when range 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:12.780
 that allows me to select 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:15.450
 randomly a number within a 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.490
 specified range that is what I am 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.450
 doing now this range will be 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.450
 between 0 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:27.009
 05 I think that's going to be good there 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:30.220
 Let's see 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:33.130
 let's see how they look now 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:36.280
 and well there is a very small variation 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:39.070
 almost imperceptible so I'm going to 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.780
 increase this range now it will stay 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:44.420
 between 0 and 5 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:48.680
 and good if indeed we can now 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:51.410
 see a much bigger variation now 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:54.470
 the three objects stopped being 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:57.860
 perfectly synchronized that is about 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:06:01.340
 what what we were looking for so 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:04.970
 well basically this is all that 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:08.600
 they need to implement a movement 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:11.980
 circulate in your objects that as you 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:15.050
 I said it can be very useful in many 

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:19.250
 circumstances and it is something that is very 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:22.010
 used in countless video games and 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:24.020
 be for items or for other things and as 

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:26.629
 See the code is very 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.789
 but very simple are two lines in the 

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:32.700
 event credit event 

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:35.760
 kate and three lines in the step event 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:37.610
 There are a total of five lines of code 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:42.229
 Really 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:44.509
 very easy and quick to implement myself 

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:47.650
 always prefer to implement these things 

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:50.599
 by codes and in events and not use 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:52.819
 these predefined actions that come 

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:54.370
 in game maker that although they are good 

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:56.110
 for 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:58.690
 for beginners who do not understand 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:02.710
 a lot of code then they are very limited 

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:07.330
 instead, starting to program 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:09.280
 properly said with code that is to the 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.710
 long I think it ends up being the best 

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.449
 so this is what I want with 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:16.320
 these tutorials do not start with things 

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:16.320
 very basic but 

00:07:16.599 --> 00:07:23.360
 using code true so good 

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:27.460
 I hope it has served you and this was 

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:27.460
 another tutorial we'll see you
