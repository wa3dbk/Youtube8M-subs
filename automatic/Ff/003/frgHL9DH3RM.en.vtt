00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.110

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:42.380
 the tournament again 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.119
 thematically given a million tip that 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.500
 It does not always work that way 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:49.270
 that before because first oracle 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.010
 I really only very briefly 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.370
 clicked on the mouse but I believe 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:56.390
 I have deleted internet 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.390
 are you up to the morning ? 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.850
 st 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.050
 Hello 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:10.280
 but just leave the ungrateful ass 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.280
 to write off from the 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.030
 So the trailer gets me really 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.500
 not he will as well as marketing 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.610
 Video material with which one tries the 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.470
 all familiar faces in front of 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.910
 to place camera around yes the 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.380
 to reach whole target audience but how 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.540
 that is also dream women brings us 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.240
 warner bros expected from 19 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.890
 February 2015 in the German cinemas after 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.510
 valentines day and the end of the berlinale 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.250
 maybe the german audience has 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.080
 he does not care about a room 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.940
 At least the trailer at least 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.960
 the dream women is about those who 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.160
 actually with her boyfriend 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.960
 but wants to contract three then 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.940
 videochat notice these are his 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.770
 Flat half-naked woman running around and that 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.390
 means with the whole thing and 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.740
 lovesickness is not very far 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.390
 away hiding in the wg 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.010
 her sister and one of the best 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.300
 she finds her sister's girlfriend 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.550
 at the same time rad love 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.960
 somehow to survive in the form of the 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.090
 fact that he is with so many men 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.650
 sleep as possible should be there 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.000
 chaos preprogrammed then that would be 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.100
 everything is not enough, ladies mother 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.750
 even one left after 30 years 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.580
 became equal to two women in the 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.900
 Family where the question is in the room 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.460
 what is love and why are men 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.440
 such assholes the whole packed 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.490
 you have to have a comic romance 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.050
 always afraid that this 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.490
 genre just ran so dead 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.840
 that the audience is not really on it 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.340
 but of course you want to be with the 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.230
 to counteract occupation 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.100
 Alone people like to berry like iris 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.750
 you kinda kinda 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.850
 older target group from and or the same 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.050

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.090
 karoline herfurth or hannah herzsprung 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.110
 we have pretty good bandwidth that 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.880
 All night with people like 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.680
 frederick lau or especially medias about 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.270
 Of course, Rick has a lot of characters 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.620
 Target audience work well as 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.209
 signage for this film 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.920
 It can certainly serve that 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.450
 this movie will definitely be successful 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.370
 at the German cinema cash registers 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.750

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.480
