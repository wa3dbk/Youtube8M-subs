across<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.390> belly<00:01:06.510> get<00:01:06.930> close-up<00:01:07.409> on<00:01:07.590> them<00:01:07.710> so

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
across the belly get close-up on them so

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.510 
across the belly get close-up on them so
they<00:01:07.920> can<00:01:08.070> see<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.340> real<00:01:08.520> clear<00:01:08.810> but<00:01:10.520> but

they can see that real clear but but

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.030 
they can see that real clear but but
they've<00:01:12.000> got<00:01:12.210> great<00:01:12.570> color<00:01:12.930> they're<00:01:13.560> really

different<00:01:14.280> from<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.760> neon<00:01:15.090> tetras<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:16.020> neon

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
different from the neon tetras the neon

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.820 
different from the neon tetras the neon
will<00:01:16.530> have<00:01:17.720> blue<00:01:18.720> more<00:01:18.990> on<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.229> front<00:01:19.530> red

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
will have blue more on the front red

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.230 
will have blue more on the front red
more<00:01:20.070> on<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.310> back<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.820> little<00:01:21.030> white<00:01:21.210> on

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
more on the back and a little white on

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.730 
more on the back and a little white on
the<00:01:21.540> band<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.840> red<00:01:22.049> doesn't<00:01:22.259> go<00:01:22.439> all<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.710> way

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
the band the red doesn't go all the way

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.620 
the band the red doesn't go all the way
across<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.340> mean<00:01:23.490> yeah<00:01:23.670> exactly

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
across I mean yeah exactly

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:25.940 
across I mean yeah exactly
usually<00:01:25.020> cardinal<00:01:25.350> checkers<00:01:25.619> are<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.770> little

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
usually cardinal checkers are a little

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.219 
usually cardinal checkers are a little
more<00:01:26.070> expensive<00:01:26.280> neons<00:01:27.090> are<00:01:27.240> usually<00:01:27.689> cheaper

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
more expensive neons are usually cheaper

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.080 
more expensive neons are usually cheaper
there's<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.680> reason<00:01:29.040> for<00:01:29.070> that<00:01:29.280> Cardinal

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
there's a reason for that Cardinal

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.179 
there's a reason for that Cardinal
tetras<00:01:30.509> are<00:01:30.630> almost<00:01:30.930> all<00:01:31.170> caught<00:01:31.560> in<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.799> wild

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
tetras are almost all caught in the wild

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.679 
tetras are almost all caught in the wild
so<00:01:32.340> these<00:01:32.460> are<00:01:32.640> all<00:01:32.790> probably<00:01:33.119> wild<00:01:33.479> caught

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
so these are all probably wild caught

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.899 
so these are all probably wild caught
fish<00:01:33.720> from<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.200> Amazons<00:01:34.619> neons<00:01:35.430> are<00:01:35.579> mostly

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
fish from the Amazons neons are mostly

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.149 
fish from the Amazons neons are mostly
tank<00:01:36.240> bred<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:36.810> guess<00:01:37.350> they<00:01:37.500> just<00:01:37.530> do<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:37.860> better

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
tank bred I guess they just do it better

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.600 
tank bred I guess they just do it better
I'm<00:01:38.340> not<00:01:38.490> exactly<00:01:38.820> sure<00:01:39.000> why<00:01:40.340> these<00:01:41.340> are<00:01:41.579> a

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
I'm not exactly sure why these are a

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.490 
I'm not exactly sure why these are a
more<00:01:41.909> difficult<00:01:42.150> fish<00:01:42.689> if<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.110> want<00:01:43.380> to

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
more difficult fish if you want to

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.530

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
with discus because Cardinal tetras are

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.550 
with discus because Cardinal tetras are
warm<00:02:09.060> water<00:02:09.300> fish<00:02:09.629> they<00:02:09.869> love<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.319> heat

hotter the better usually they come from

Jason's in Brazil the Rio Negro and then
it's<00:02:17.550> like<00:02:17.670> it's<00:02:17.819> a<00:02:17.940> rink<00:02:18.180> oh<00:02:18.330> I<00:02:18.360> think<00:02:18.540> it's

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
it's like it's a rink oh I think it's

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.059 
it's like it's a rink oh I think it's
how<00:02:19.080> you<00:02:19.140> pronounce<00:02:19.440> that<00:02:19.560> I<00:02:19.680> could<00:02:19.830> have<00:02:19.950> that

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
how you pronounce that I could have that

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.940 
how you pronounce that I could have that
wrong<00:02:20.310> but<00:02:20.670> in<00:02:21.330> Brazil<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.260> I<00:02:22.349> was<00:02:22.530> reading<00:02:22.860> on

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
wrong but in Brazil and I was reading on

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.650 
wrong but in Brazil and I was reading on
them<00:02:23.099> as<00:02:23.220> well<00:02:23.459> even<00:02:23.970> though<00:02:24.180> Steve<00:02:24.420> is<00:02:24.540> the

them as well even though Steve is the
man<00:02:24.840> that<00:02:25.020> keeps<00:02:25.170> them<00:02:25.470> that<00:02:25.849> they<00:02:26.849> are<00:02:27.390> bred<00:02:27.599> a

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
man that keeps them that they are bred a

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.089 
man that keeps them that they are bred a
little<00:02:27.959> bit<00:02:28.080> in<00:02:28.200> captivity<00:02:28.440> but<00:02:28.770> not<00:02:28.920> that

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
little bit in captivity but not that

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:30.940 
little bit in captivity but not that
much<00:02:29.310> but<00:02:29.489> what<00:02:29.670> they're<00:02:29.819> trying<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.209> do<00:02:30.450> is

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
much but what they're trying to do is

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.009 
much but what they're trying to do is
propose<00:02:31.950> that<00:02:32.370> like<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:33.209> capturing<00:02:33.750> of

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
propose that like the capturing of

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.410 
propose that like the capturing of
Cardinal<00:02:34.440> tetras<00:02:35.130> is<00:02:35.310> like<00:02:35.459> such<00:02:35.700> a<00:02:35.730> vital

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
Cardinal tetras is like such a vital

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.570 
Cardinal tetras is like such a vital
part<00:02:36.630> of<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.870> economy<00:02:37.739> in<00:02:37.980> certain<00:02:38.310> areas

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
part of the economy in certain areas

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.680 
part of the economy in certain areas
it's<00:02:38.819> important<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.209> keep<00:02:39.360> that<00:02:39.540> business

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
it's important to keep that business

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.300 
it's important to keep that business
going<00:02:40.110> it's<00:02:40.230> also<00:02:40.470> good<00:02:40.860> for<00:02:40.890> people<00:02:41.069> to

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
going it's also good for people to

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.309 
going it's also good for people to
understand<00:02:41.790> how<00:02:41.940> deforestation<00:02:42.900> of<00:02:43.260> the

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
understand how deforestation of the

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.100 
understand how deforestation of the
rainforests<00:02:44.220> will<00:02:44.819> be<00:02:45.209> affected<00:02:45.780> so<00:02:45.810> like

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
rainforests will be affected so like

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.570 
rainforests will be affected so like
these<00:02:46.260> people<00:02:46.410> will<00:02:46.620> lose<00:02:46.739> their<00:02:46.799> job<00:02:47.190> so<00:02:47.459> it's

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
these people will lose their job so it's

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.920 
these people will lose their job so it's
important<00:02:47.970> for<00:02:48.060> them<00:02:48.209> to<00:02:48.239> kind<00:02:48.540> of<00:02:48.569> have<00:02:48.630> that

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
important for them to kind of have that

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.840 
important for them to kind of have that
thing<00:02:49.170> going<00:02:49.350> on<00:02:49.590> where<00:02:50.340> they're<00:02:50.549> like<00:02:50.730> you

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
thing going on where they're like you

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.240 
thing going on where they're like you
know<00:02:50.970> still<00:02:51.269> a<00:02:51.299> part<00:02:51.690> of<00:02:51.810> an<00:02:51.900> economic<00:02:52.470> system

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
know still a part of an economic system

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.380 
know still a part of an economic system
and<00:02:53.370> then<00:02:53.489> know<00:02:53.640> that<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.850> rainforest<00:02:54.330> is

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
and then know that the rainforest is

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.300 
and then know that the rainforest is
important<00:02:54.810> to<00:02:55.319> produce<00:02:55.560> beautiful<00:02:55.709> fish<00:02:56.100> like

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
important to produce beautiful fish like

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.360 
important to produce beautiful fish like
this<00:02:56.549> so<00:02:57.170> warmer<00:02:58.170> temps<00:02:58.650> they<00:02:58.769> prefer<00:02:59.099> a<00:02:59.130> lower

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
this so warmer temps they prefer a lower

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.920 
this so warmer temps they prefer a lower
pH<00:02:59.610> but<00:02:59.910> Steve<00:03:00.120> I<00:03:00.209> was<00:03:00.269> asking<00:03:00.630> you<00:03:00.720> about<00:03:00.750> that

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
pH but Steve I was asking you about that

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.410 
pH but Steve I was asking you about that
and<00:03:01.200> you're<00:03:01.319> telling<00:03:01.500> me<00:03:01.620> that<00:03:01.739> pH<00:03:02.430> yeah<00:03:03.390> I

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
and you're telling me that pH yeah I

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.449 
and you're telling me that pH yeah I
mean<00:03:03.870> there's<00:03:04.110> this<00:03:04.349> 10x<00:03:04.709> basically<00:03:05.130> a<00:03:05.160> pH<00:03:05.430> of

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
mean there's this 10x basically a pH of

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.600 
mean there's this 10x basically a pH of
seven<00:03:06.030> these<00:03:06.630> fish<00:03:06.930> do<00:03:07.260> great<00:03:07.799> ah<00:03:08.130> you<00:03:08.459> know

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
seven these fish do great ah you know

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.670 
seven these fish do great ah you know
they<00:03:08.940> come<00:03:09.209> from<00:03:09.360> a<00:03:09.480> place<00:03:09.690> with<00:03:09.870> low<00:03:10.019> pH<00:03:10.349> I

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
they come from a place with low pH I

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.650 
they come from a place with low pH I
don't<00:03:11.190> really<00:03:11.400> worry<00:03:11.580> about<00:03:11.640> pH<00:03:12.090> I<00:03:12.299> just<00:03:12.480> worry

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
don't really worry about pH I just worry

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.020 
don't really worry about pH I just worry
about<00:03:12.720> good<00:03:13.110> water<00:03:13.380> quality<00:03:13.709> good<00:03:14.370> filtration

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
about good water quality good filtration

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.000 
about good water quality good filtration
and<00:03:15.180> heat<00:03:15.450> I<00:03:15.720> don't<00:03:16.260> like<00:03:16.410> to<00:03:16.530> keep<00:03:16.650> Cardinal

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
and heat I don't like to keep Cardinal

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.160 
and heat I don't like to keep Cardinal
tetras<00:03:17.280> saying<00:03:17.430> lower<00:03:17.640> than<00:03:17.790> 78<00:03:18.209> degrees<00:03:18.570> I've
