00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.650
 plus 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.990
 something is happening not only here but 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.480
 all over the planet we do not realize 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.400
 Fortunately, I have never been hurt 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.240
 this bad moment that I am passing my 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.340
 eyes from so much crying nothing awakens the 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.520
 history repeats itself says my father from 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.950
 far away to the phone crying like 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.120
 children with a feeling of all this 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.560
 I lived as a bomb, it detonated us as a girl 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.030
 I love 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.520
 the sky family is not destroyed 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.430
 then we are fire and like fire we 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.739
 we burn nobody flees block to block one 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.809
 False happiness tower for papers that 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.079
 They fill in the gaps but they do not stop 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.309
 rain the great storm follows and flows 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.129
 crouched like slaves of a whore 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:02.680
 fantasy toys to hate us what 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.659
 we seek today are not times of 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.509
 war not much freedom freedom war 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:10.149
 Silent and cold is still sick and my 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:13.229
 gas mask every day tears and 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:15.759
 I feel empty for that cold heart 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.160
 united everywhere frightened and every time 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:22.080
 it's nobody like a river but that angel that 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.080
 he does not leave me behind and he flips to the sky 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.630
 when you feel that love is over 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:31.510
 your path is cut off and it does not come out 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.240
 more the sun when this offer that still 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:38.500
 we are still alive although you feel bodies 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.390
 I do not know how to be with you, friend, a veteran 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:46.630
 you feel dead inside someone else 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:50.460
 is with you so for suffering that 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.460
 I'm saying it to me
