00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:14.840
 to football a great passion 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:16.909
 the only one capable of mobilizing far-reaching masses 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.429
 overshadow political events 

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:21.560
 of historical importance and sometimes due to 

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:23.119
 marital separations, however, a party 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.669
 the passion of some fans 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.619
 but sometimes organized like that and yes 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:28.130
 transforms into hatred and terrible gestures of 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.890
 violence 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.800
 here more recent clashes and data 10 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.840
 most dangerous fans in tenth place 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.359
 we find the ultras of the olympiacos 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.670
 the gates group and the name of this one 

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:42.260
 faction and memory of the 21 fans who 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.800
 died in the disaster of the stadium 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.359
 karaiskakis of February 1981 this 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.640
 group and more fans 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:51.949
 passionate and spectacular of europe for 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.109
 celebratory banners and choirs during 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:55.789
 derby with the panathinaikos the bitter 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:57.710
 rival, however, the best 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.499
 or perhaps it is fairer to say the worst of 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.269
 itself as in 2011 when the fans 

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:03.679
 red and white at the end of the match based on 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:05.360
 field trying to get in touch 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:07.520
 with the players of the opposing team 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.350
 they also exploded a flare that 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.170
 generates a fire principle a 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.940
 Olympia had won in Europe 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.500
 of the east and the term hooligans 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.840
 used to indicate more fans 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.430
 unlucky are unfortunately very famous 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.230
 the stars are among the hottest 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.910
 white of the wisla cracovia that 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.240
 of course when they meet those 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.920
 of ksc in derbies they lose their breasts in 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.470
 2011 this group was implicated 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.820
 in the murder of thomas c leader of the 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.980
 opposite fans 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.480
 the man was ambushed it is 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.550
 been surrounded by about ten 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.200
 people armed with bars and machetes is 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.670
 died of beatings during the 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.140
 ambulance ride 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.640
 this type of aggression is only one 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.740
 example of those perpetrated by 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.660
 violent supporters of the area one of the 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.160
 most famous teams and with more followers at 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.990
 world has been heavily penalized 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.900
 from the violent actions of some groups 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.340
 of fans the corinthias 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.230
 the most emblematic example was that 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.850
 of 2011 in the match against the team 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.530
 bolivian of san jose 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.300
 the fans of the timao have been accused 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.340
 of the death of an opposing supporter 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.810
 14 year old 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.030
 killed by a firework has 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.039
 launched from the curve following this 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.989
 made all subsequent matches of the 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.060
 corinthias during the prestigious copa 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.430
 libertadores the greatest competition 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.040
 South American were held at doors 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.080
 closed in seventh place we find the 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.819
 supporters of one of the 14 teams of 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.099
 football of the capital of the united kingdom 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.500
 that of the west ham united in the last ones 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.599
 fortunately times and hammerson have 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.040
 strong for fighting clashes but they have one 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.790
 long history of this kind at 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.280
 shoulders 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.230
 in the 70's 80's were in fact among the 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.269
 more violent fans to induce 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.400
 the British government to act on this 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.340
 the curve had a name intercity 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.420
 this form of organized supporters 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.459
 it took its name from the land with which it was 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.260
 fans usually went to the stadium 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.900
 they dressed casually so as not to attract 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.799
 attention act undisturbed 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.780
 especially during longer games 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:55.750
 lit against the bitter enemy 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.519
 the millwall club is in fact to follow 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.810
 we find our own fans of this 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.579
 London neighborhood 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.970
 the rivalry between millwall and west ham has 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:05.379
 distant origins dated 1926 by one 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.299
 workers' general strike 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:09.010
 the disagreements between the workers shifted 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.079
 from the streets to the camp I do 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.030
 they continued for years and continue 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:15.310
 still it is in fact the most derby 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.410
 inflamed of europe and not by chance has 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.690
 inspired by the events of the hooligans film 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.459
 but because the millwall bush rockers 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.500
 advance one position with respect to the 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.790
 hammers because they invented a weapon 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.370
 ad hoc to avoid checks 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.620
 at the entrance of the stadium the millwall 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.930
 bric folded newspaper and e 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.299
 pressed in such a way as to obtain the 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.700
 hardness of a bat a tube 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.319
 now let's pass no enthusiastic fans among 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.660
 the most passionate and passionate 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.280
 of Europe that of the galatasaray that 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.329
 the most popular club has remained for decades 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.130
 from turkey 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:47.620
 club fans are well known 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.569
 international for shows from 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.010
 stands and the reception reserved for them 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.829
 guests with this message 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.930
 welcome to hell the players 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:58.959
 Giallorossi have record-breaking supporters 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.760
 in fact, on March 18, 2011 they established 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.060
 the new world record of the strongest 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.140
 stadium choir 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.370
 touching the 100 31.76 decibels 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.099
 unfortunately, however, the followers of the team 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.930
 they also stand out for numerous attacks 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:13.700
 also resulted in murders like in the 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.010
 last May after the derby with the 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.780
 fenerbahce a young supporter of the 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.150
 gialloblù was stabbed and killed 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.490
 by a group of galatasaray fans a 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.590
 a bus stop 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.660
 we stay in the area and go to the Balkans a 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.730
 belgrade where the animosity of the ultra 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.080
 of football teams is still affected 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.210
 much of the difficult situation 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.100
 policy that has characterized the country 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.810
 in recent years the hooligans of 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.270
 partizan are no exception 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.889
 in 2008 for an armed confrontation 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.070
 organized between the bianconeri and those 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:45.380
 a novi sad died a man in 2012 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.690
 yet another victim to the fans of the 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.280
 Toulouse's host city team is 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.110
 was at all ambushed in a bar 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.250
 before the match and a Frenchman died 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.470
 for beatings 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.000
 it must be said that the partizan is not the only one 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.479
 Belgrade team to have fans 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.090
 violent 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:01.820
 unfortunately also the red star his 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:03.710
 of the IGE or heroes were paramilitaries 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.200
 Serbs during the Balkan conflict of the 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.750
 90 and often to resolve things e 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.789
 I run from violence to third place 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.870
 we move back to the other side 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:13.460
 ocean 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.770
 we go to colombia to know i 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.450
 national athletes supporter on 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.950
 fact that the fans are violent 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.870
 attached to crime is not surprising 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:23.000
 since the club was partly 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.500
 managed and funded in the 1980s by 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.650
 infamous drug dealer pablo 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.120
 escobar in 2012 its ultras are 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.250
 been involved in the umpteenth fight 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.410
 deadly with the other's supporter 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:36.410
 team of the city the result 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:38.030
 one dead and nine injured and 315 people 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.470
 arrested 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.060
 the most absurd thing is that they exist 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.639
 different factions within the same 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.560
 curve that often collide with each other and 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:45.950
 even there the dead man escapes like some 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.039
 month ago 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:50.630
 the fact is that tifoserie purpose in the 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:53.740
 unfortunately south america go hand in hand 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:56.120
 and indeed the Latin extremist fans e 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.280
 even organized under the group 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.960
 which takes the name of barrabravas ne 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.150
 they are part both of the athletics ho 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.650
 quoted before that of boca juniors 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.570
 the strongest is a beloved Argentine team 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:08.280
 the supporter does not only deal with 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:10.350
 realize intimidating atmospheres and 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.150
 scenic in the stadiums but also of the 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:14.090
 buy ticket sales and others 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:16.229
 illegal business related to the matches 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.210
 inside the ultras also here vi 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:19.350
 are different groups competing for 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.840
 business supremacy through 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:23.400
 clashes often deadly like those of the 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.180
 July of this year in which they died 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.699
 two people 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:29.310
 at the scene of the battle the police 

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:31.169
 has collected at least 90 cartridges 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:33.000
 given the structuring the links with the 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:34.259
 organized crime would just come from 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.990
 put the teams first 

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:38.669
 South American but a recent one has happened 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:40.199
 fact that makes the head jump to the chart 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:43.280
 to supporters of an Egyptian team 

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:47.580
 that of al masri is almost unknown 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:49.320
 February 2012 at the farm beats the ahli 3 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.479
 to 1 the rivalry between the two teams 

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.880
 historical but this does not justify the 

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:55.710
 followed by the fans of al masri invade 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.870
 the field to look for the clash with the 

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:59.729
 ultrà opponents are assaulted 

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:01.349
 however also the spectators and players 

00:06:59.729 --> 00:07:03.960
 law enforcement with launch of 

00:07:01.349 --> 00:07:07.139
 banked and bengal bottles and stones 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:10.080
 the result is 79 dead and over 250 

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:11.760
 wounded in jargon the curve of the fans is 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.560
 called the twelfth man 

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.330
