size<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.380> throttle<00:01:55.710> body<00:01:55.860> that's<00:01:56.189> definitely

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
size of throttle body that's definitely

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.219 
size of throttle body that's definitely
got<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.880> be<00:01:57.000> fixed<00:01:57.329> before<00:01:57.420> this<00:01:57.719> car<00:01:57.990> leaves

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
got to be fixed before this car leaves

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.160 
got to be fixed before this car leaves
the<00:01:58.350> bay<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:59.430> we've<00:01:59.850> got<00:02:00.030> some<00:02:00.210> others<00:02:00.479> see

the bay and we've got some others see
sources<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:02.009> leaks<00:02:02.540> looks<00:02:03.540> like<00:02:03.840> hmm

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
sources of leaks looks like hmm

because<00:03:22.890> of<00:03:23.040> larger<00:03:23.430> leaks<00:03:23.640> so<00:03:24.330> just<00:03:24.840> take

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
because of larger leaks so just take

I've got a leak intake manifold leaking

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.300 
I've got a leak intake manifold leaking
straight<00:04:06.570> out<00:04:06.900> an<00:04:07.080> intake<00:04:07.350> manifold<00:04:07.830> gasket

straight out an intake manifold gasket
and<00:04:08.810> whew<00:04:09.840> I've<00:04:10.410> got<00:04:10.650> an<00:04:10.740> injector<00:04:11.420> looks<00:04:12.420> like

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
and whew I've got an injector looks like

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.820 
and whew I've got an injector looks like
number<00:04:14.850> two<00:04:15.060> injector<00:04:15.720> is<00:04:15.900> leaking<00:04:16.710> around

number two injector is leaking around
the<00:04:17.160> o-rings<00:04:18.350> and<00:04:19.880> I<00:04:20.880> have<00:04:21.180> a<00:04:21.210> little<00:04:21.450> bit<00:04:21.660> of<00:04:21.750> a

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
the o-rings and I have a little bit of a

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.450 
the o-rings and I have a little bit of a
leak<00:04:22.049> oh<00:04:22.460> and<00:04:23.460> I<00:04:23.640> got<00:04:23.790> a<00:04:23.850> split<00:04:24.330> right<00:04:24.540> here<00:04:24.780> too

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
leak oh and I got a split right here too

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.260 
leak oh and I got a split right here too
it<00:04:26.460> was<00:04:26.610> holding

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
it was holding

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.210 
it was holding
when<00:04:27.930> the<00:04:28.050> other<00:04:28.199> leaks<00:04:28.380> were<00:04:28.590> leaking<00:04:28.800> but

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
when the other leaks were leaking but

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.559 
when the other leaks were leaking but
now<00:04:29.370> it's<00:04:29.580> leaking<00:04:29.789> a<00:04:29.970> little<00:04:30.180> bit<00:04:30.300> around

00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:30.569 
now it's leaking a little bit around

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:32.379 
now it's leaking a little bit around
this<00:04:30.690> split<00:04:31.080> so<00:04:31.259> we<00:04:31.349> definitely<00:04:31.530> need<00:04:31.830> a<00:04:31.860> boot

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389 
this split so we definitely need a boot

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:35.240 
this split so we definitely need a boot

cover<00:04:38.250> we've<00:04:38.610> got<00:04:38.849> some<00:04:39.030> work<00:04:39.210> to<00:04:39.270> do<00:04:39.569> here

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:39.599 
cover we've got some work to do here

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:41.390 
cover we've got some work to do here
we've<00:04:40.319> got<00:04:40.410> a<00:04:40.470> good<00:04:40.650> sale<00:04:40.919> too

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
we've got a good sale too

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.330 
we've got a good sale too
but<00:04:42.270> we<00:04:42.360> had<00:04:42.479> a<00:04:42.509> lot<00:04:42.720> of<00:04:42.750> leaks<00:04:43.050> in<00:04:43.319> fact<00:04:44.099> it

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
but we had a lot of leaks in fact it

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.890 
but we had a lot of leaks in fact it
became<00:04:44.789> difficult<00:04:45.000> to<00:04:45.270> get<00:04:45.389> the<00:04:45.479> camera<00:04:45.810> in

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
became difficult to get the camera in

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.200 
became difficult to get the camera in
there<00:04:46.020> to<00:04:46.169> see<00:04:46.349> the<00:04:46.470> injector<00:04:46.949> leak<00:04:47.099> so<00:04:47.819> that's

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
there to see the injector leak so that's

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.570 
there to see the injector leak so that's
where<00:04:48.419> the<00:04:48.569> ultra<00:04:48.900> ultra<00:04:49.380> trace<00:04:49.620> UV<00:04:50.009> dye<00:04:50.250> comes

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
where the ultra ultra trace UV dye comes

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.820 
where the ultra ultra trace UV dye comes
in<00:04:50.789> so<00:04:51.449> let's<00:04:52.229> go<00:04:52.319> ahead<00:04:52.440> and<00:04:52.590> put<00:04:52.680> on<00:04:52.770> our

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
in so let's go ahead and put on our

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.189 
in so let's go ahead and put on our
glasses<00:04:53.099> get<00:04:53.880> our<00:04:54.000> blacklight<00:04:54.449> out<00:04:54.630> and<00:04:55.080> look

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 
glasses get our blacklight out and look

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:58.930 
glasses get our blacklight out and look
at<00:04:55.289> some<00:04:55.440> of<00:04:55.530> that<00:04:55.590> ultra<00:04:55.979> trace<00:04:56.220> UV<00:04:56.639> dye<00:04:56.900> as

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
at some of that ultra trace UV dye as

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.360 
at some of that ultra trace UV dye as
you<00:04:59.940> can<00:05:00.090> see<00:05:00.300> here<00:05:00.569> the<00:05:00.990> injector<00:05:01.650> right

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
you can see here the injector right

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.770 
you can see here the injector right
where<00:05:02.610> it<00:05:02.729> enters<00:05:03.030> the<00:05:03.180> bottom<00:05:03.479> of<00:05:03.569> the<00:05:03.630> lower

intake is leaking vacuum we've got a
vacuum<00:05:07.319> leak<00:05:07.500> there<00:05:07.860> and<00:05:08.039> you<00:05:08.310> can<00:05:08.460> also<00:05:08.610> see

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
vacuum leak there and you can also see

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.520 
vacuum leak there and you can also see
what<00:05:09.210> we<00:05:09.330> were<00:05:09.449> seeing<00:05:09.659> really<00:05:09.930> well<00:05:10.199> with<00:05:10.440> the

what we were seeing really well with the

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.100 
what we were seeing really well with the
smoke<00:05:10.830> and<00:05:11.099> that<00:05:11.699> is<00:05:11.909> the<00:05:12.300> intake<00:05:12.690> upper

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
out with the smoke even if it was like a

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.300 
out with the smoke even if it was like a
leak<00:05:32.550> on<00:05:32.699> the<00:05:32.849> lower<00:05:33.419> intake<00:05:34.199> when<00:05:34.979> you<00:05:35.099> take

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
leak on the lower intake when you take

things<00:05:35.520> apart<00:05:35.759> then<00:05:36.479> you<00:05:36.659> see<00:05:36.900> the

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
things apart then you see the

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.439 
things apart then you see the
fingerprints<00:05:37.889> the<00:05:38.310> evidence<00:05:38.759> if<00:05:38.940> you<00:05:38.969> will<00:05:39.090> of

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:39.449 
fingerprints the evidence if you will of

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:40.339 
fingerprints the evidence if you will of
a<00:05:39.930> leak

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:40.349 
a leak

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:42.230 
a leak
makes<00:05:40.620> you<00:05:40.770> feel<00:05:40.949> like<00:05:41.190> hey<00:05:41.430> I<00:05:41.610> nailed<00:05:42.030> this

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
thing and I know what gaskets to buy

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.330 
thing and I know what gaskets to buy
what<00:05:45.060> procedures<00:05:45.509> to<00:05:45.659> do<00:05:45.840> now<00:05:46.680> the<00:05:47.009> way<00:05:47.159> we

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
what procedures to do now the way we

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.370 
what procedures to do now the way we
used<00:05:47.610> to<00:05:47.759> do<00:05:47.880> things<00:05:48.090> we<00:05:48.360> used<00:05:48.539> to<00:05:48.630> use<00:05:48.840> gum<00:05:49.259> out

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
used to do things we used to use gum out

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.409 
used to do things we used to use gum out
or<00:05:49.590> some<00:05:49.830> product<00:05:50.190> like<00:05:50.310> that<00:05:50.340> to<00:05:50.669> spray<00:05:51.090> and

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:51.419 
or some product like that to spray and

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:53.350 
or some product like that to spray and
listen<00:05:51.960> for<00:05:52.080> the<00:05:52.139> engine<00:05:52.530> to<00:05:52.620> change<00:05:52.889> speeds

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 
listen for the engine to change speeds

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.180 
listen for the engine to change speeds
now<00:05:54.360> we<00:05:55.139> can<00:05:55.320> do<00:05:55.409> it<00:05:55.440> with<00:05:55.680> smoke<00:05:55.919> we<00:05:56.069> can

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
now we can do it with smoke we can

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.370 
now we can do it with smoke we can
actually<00:05:56.490> see<00:05:56.789> the<00:05:57.000> leaks<00:05:57.180> gum<00:05:57.870> out<00:05:58.020> might

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 
actually see the leaks gum out might

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.379 
actually see the leaks gum out might
have<00:05:58.650> caught<00:05:58.889> that<00:05:59.099> intake<00:05:59.460> manifold<00:05:59.940> gasket

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:00.389 
have caught that intake manifold gasket

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:01.909 
have caught that intake manifold gasket
we<00:06:00.509> might<00:06:00.659> have<00:06:00.780> missed<00:06:01.020> the<00:06:01.139> o-ring<00:06:01.500> or<00:06:01.680> vice

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 
we might have missed the o-ring or vice
