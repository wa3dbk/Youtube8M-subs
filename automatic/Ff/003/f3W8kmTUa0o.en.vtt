percent defense of get so color and yeah
oh<00:04:28.100> yeah<00:04:29.100> can<00:04:29.460> withstand<00:04:32.990> attacks<00:04:36.380> like

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
oh yeah can withstand attacks like

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.790 
oh yeah can withstand attacks like
Arthur<00:04:39.240> Korea<00:04:40.490> sometimes<00:04:41.490> but<00:04:42.000> sometimes<00:04:42.180> not

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
Arthur Korea sometimes but sometimes not

Arthur Korea sometimes but sometimes not
and<00:04:44.720> yeah<00:04:45.720> I'm<00:04:45.990> surprised<00:04:46.500> even<00:04:46.710> though<00:04:46.950> it's

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
and yeah I'm surprised even though it's

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.800 
and yeah I'm surprised even though it's
a<00:04:47.280> summit<00:04:47.669> at<00:04:47.850> beyblade<00:04:48.270> it<00:04:48.450> can<00:04:48.660> withstand

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
a summit at beyblade it can withstand

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:57.280 
a summit at beyblade it can withstand
attacks<00:04:51.980> and<00:04:53.270> it<00:04:54.270> sets<00:04:54.570> in<00:04:54.840> the<00:04:54.990> specialty<00:04:55.800> or

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
attacks and it sets in the specialty or

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.340 
attacks and it sets in the specialty or
a<00:04:58.290> sense<00:04:58.620> in<00:04:58.770> a<00:04:58.860> box<00:04:59.419> again<00:05:00.419> for<00:05:01.230> its

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
a sense in a box again for its

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:10.540 
a sense in a box again for its
speciality<00:05:06.500> I<00:05:07.500> mean<00:05:08.040> yeah<00:05:08.610> its<00:05:09.180> speciality<00:05:09.419> is

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
speciality I mean yeah its speciality is

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:17.180 
speciality I mean yeah its speciality is
the<00:05:12.350> the<00:05:14.870> bottom<00:05:15.870> is<00:05:16.140> made<00:05:16.320> of<00:05:16.500> metal<00:05:16.860> sharp

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
the the bottom is made of metal sharp

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.360 
the the bottom is made of metal sharp
and<00:05:17.630> that's<00:05:18.630> been<00:05:18.810> very<00:05:19.260> very<00:05:19.770> wrong<00:05:19.979> than

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
and that's been very very wrong than

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:27.100 
and that's been very very wrong than
plastic<00:05:21.210> metal<00:05:21.600> a<00:05:21.860> plastic<00:05:23.390> bottom<00:05:24.390> and<00:05:25.700> yeah

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
plastic metal a plastic bottom and yeah

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:34.280 
plastic metal a plastic bottom and yeah
and<00:05:29.000> way<00:05:30.000> to<00:05:30.060> call<00:05:30.240> this<00:05:31.190> and<00:05:32.810> it<00:05:33.810> got<00:05:34.050> a

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
and way to call this and it got a

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:40.130 
and way to call this and it got a
pattern<00:05:34.860> of<00:05:35.130> fighting<00:05:37.010> get<00:05:38.010> eat<00:05:38.900> swivels<00:05:39.900> a

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.140 
pattern of fighting get eat swivels a

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.320 
pattern of fighting get eat swivels a
little<00:05:40.320> bit<00:05:40.470> because<00:05:40.680> it's<00:05:41.040> metal<00:05:41.460> not

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
little bit because it's metal not

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:47.690 
little bit because it's metal not
plastic<00:05:42.410> it<00:05:44.210> spins<00:05:45.210> like<00:05:45.510> this<00:05:45.840> if<00:05:46.490> it's<00:05:47.490> been

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:47.700 
plastic it spins like this if it's been

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.600 
plastic it spins like this if it's been
attacked<00:05:48.120> by<00:05:48.660> attack<00:05:49.020> that<00:05:49.290> lately<00:05:49.560> it's<00:05:50.550> like

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
attacked by attack that lately it's like

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.580 
attacked by attack that lately it's like
spin<00:05:51.390> around<00:05:51.510> like<00:05:51.960> that<00:05:53.960> yes<00:05:54.960> pinner<00:05:55.350> not

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
spin around like that yes pinner not

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.780 
spin around like that yes pinner not
like<00:05:55.800> that<00:05:56.479> so<00:05:57.650> for<00:05:58.650> example<00:05:58.680> this<00:05:59.130> is<00:05:59.190> Pegasus

00:05:59.780 --> 00:05:59.790 
like that so for example this is Pegasus

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.420 
like that so for example this is Pegasus
I<00:06:00.030> mean<00:06:00.600> this<00:06:00.870> is<00:06:00.930> Pegasus<00:06:01.470> and

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
I mean this is Pegasus and

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.860 
I mean this is Pegasus and
this<00:06:02.550> weapon<00:06:03.420> x<00:06:03.780> being<00:06:04.110> a<00:06:04.200> tax<00:06:04.470> rate<00:06:04.770> and<00:06:05.870> I'll

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870 
this weapon x being a tax rate and I'll

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:10.040 
this weapon x being a tax rate and I'll
bit<00:06:07.200> off<00:06:07.410> balance<00:06:07.650> and<00:06:08.450> spinning<00:06:09.450> around<00:06:09.540> and

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
bit off balance and spinning around and

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.480 
bit off balance and spinning around and
it<00:06:10.950> starts<00:06:12.140> to<00:06:13.140> look<00:06:13.170> like<00:06:13.350> it's<00:06:13.740> defensing

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
it starts to look like it's defensing

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:20.000 
it starts to look like it's defensing
its<00:06:14.670> attack<00:06:15.140> yeah<00:06:16.520> not<00:06:17.520> like<00:06:19.010> Sagittario

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.010 
its attack yeah not like Sagittario

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:24.730 
its attack yeah not like Sagittario
let's<00:06:20.640> make<00:06:20.820> a<00:06:20.850> plastic<00:06:21.360> bin<00:06:22.350> it<00:06:22.860> attacks<00:06:23.360> and

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:24.740 
let's make a plastic bin it attacks and

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.990 
let's make a plastic bin it attacks and
it<00:06:25.740> doesn't<00:06:26.120> go<00:06:27.120> for<00:06:27.330> the<00:06:27.420> balance<00:06:27.840> like<00:06:29.000> like

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 
it doesn't go for the balance like like

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.940 
it doesn't go for the balance like like
burn<00:06:30.510> Phoenix<00:06:31.190> so<00:06:32.360> attack<00:06:33.360> and<00:06:33.630> it<00:06:34.350> goes<00:06:34.620> orbit

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:34.950 
burn Phoenix so attack and it goes orbit

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.550 
burn Phoenix so attack and it goes orbit
order<00:06:35.250> and<00:06:35.460> because<00:06:36.420> this<00:06:36.630> will<00:06:37.020> attack<00:06:37.350> from

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 
order and because this will attack from

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:43.420 
order and because this will attack from
the<00:06:37.860> bottom<00:06:38.160> and<00:06:40.760> mmm<00:06:41.760> we'll<00:06:42.240> be<00:06:42.450> staging<00:06:42.870> out

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:43.430 
the bottom and mmm we'll be staging out

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:53.380 
the bottom and mmm we'll be staging out
ya<00:06:44.900> neck<00:06:45.900> out<00:06:46.140> from<00:06:46.470> the<00:06:46.590> stadium<00:06:47.810> so<00:06:49.340> yeah<00:06:50.340> a

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:53.390 

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:58.340 

nice<00:06:54.390> baby<00:06:55.520> that<00:06:56.520> made<00:06:56.760> that<00:06:57.510> is<00:06:57.750> both

00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:58.350 
nice baby that made that is both

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:08.250 
it's great it's springs longer and can

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:14.450 
it's great it's springs longer and can
withstand<00:07:08.760> attack<00:07:09.720> types<00:07:10.400> but<00:07:11.540> not<00:07:12.920> what<00:07:13.920> r<00:07:14.040> %

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:14.460 
withstand attack types but not what r %

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:19.970 
withstand attack types but not what r %
it's<00:07:15.270> like<00:07:16.550> Eartha<00:07:17.550> critical<00:07:17.970> here<00:07:18.770> it's<00:07:19.770> like

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:19.980 
it's like Eartha critical here it's like

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:26.930 
it's like Eartha critical here it's like
