head at the end so they can stop your

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.400 
head at the end so they can stop your
bead<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:23.850> they<00:00:24.300> just<00:00:24.480> have<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.720> straight<00:00:25.230> edge

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
bead and they just have a straight edge

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.839 
bead and they just have a straight edge
at<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.650> bottom<00:00:25.680> so<00:00:26.130> you're<00:00:26.279> able<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.580> put

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
at the bottom so you're able to put

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.910 
at the bottom so you're able to put
beads<00:00:27.029> on<00:00:27.180> top<00:00:27.359> of<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:27.689> then<00:00:28.560> you'll<00:00:28.740> just

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
beads on top of that then you'll just

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.950 
beads on top of that then you'll just
need<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.130> couple<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.609> beads<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.210> you<00:00:30.599> can<00:00:30.779> use

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
beads so I'm gonna first take the head

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.900 
beads so I'm gonna first take the head
pin<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.050> I'm<00:00:37.770> going<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.040> put<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.340> smaller<00:00:38.670> bead

pin and I'm going to put a smaller bead

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.440 
pin and I'm going to put a smaller bead
at<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.120> bottom<00:00:39.770> so<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:40.890> doesn't<00:00:40.920> fall<00:00:41.430> off<00:00:41.610> and

at the bottom so it doesn't fall off and

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.930 
at the bottom so it doesn't fall off and
you<00:00:42.829> might<00:00:43.829> need<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.070> test<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.430> couple<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.789> beads

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
you might need to test a couple of beads

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.639 
you might need to test a couple of beads
as<00:00:45.090> well<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.510> make<00:00:45.629> sure<00:00:45.690> that<00:00:46.020> they<00:00:46.110> don't<00:00:46.289> and

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
as well to make sure that they don't and

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.799 
as well to make sure that they don't and
then<00:00:47.460> I'm<00:00:47.579> going<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.850> put<00:00:48.059> bigger<00:00:48.329> beads<00:00:48.660> on

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
then I'm going to put bigger beads on

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.420 
then I'm going to put bigger beads on
and<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.200> can<00:00:49.410> make<00:00:49.649> them<00:00:49.800> in<00:00:49.980> any<00:00:50.190> way<00:00:50.280> that

after you have all of your beads in line
you're<00:01:02.070> gonna<00:01:02.219> take<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.820> bend<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.239> at<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.420> 90

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
you're gonna take it and bend it at a 90

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.789 
you're gonna take it and bend it at a 90
degree<00:01:04.140> angle<00:01:04.400> like<00:01:05.400> this<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:06.470> after<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.619> do

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
degree angle like this and after you do

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.520 
degree angle like this and after you do
that<00:01:07.830> you're<00:01:08.610> gonna<00:01:08.700> cut<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.570> wire<00:01:09.750> using<00:01:10.290> the

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
that you're gonna cut the wire using the

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.770 
that you're gonna cut the wire using the
wire<00:01:10.740> cutters<00:01:11.090> about<00:01:12.090> three<00:01:12.450> or<00:01:12.570> four

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
wire cutters about three or four

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.039 
wire cutters about three or four
centimeters<00:01:13.170> from<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.680> top<00:01:14.509> after<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.840> cut

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
centimeters from the top after you cut

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.620 
centimeters from the top after you cut
them<00:01:16.229> then<00:01:17.189> you're<00:01:17.369> going<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.790> use<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.299> needle

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
them then you're going to use the needle

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.190 
them then you're going to use the needle
nose<00:01:18.659> pliers<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.560> bend<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.400> into<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.759> circle

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
nose pliers and bend it into a circle

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.690 
nose pliers and bend it into a circle
now<00:01:22.200> before<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.650> bend<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:23.009> all<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.189> way<00:01:23.520> into

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
now before you bend it all the way into

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.719 
now before you bend it all the way into
a<00:01:23.820> circle<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.360> want<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.659> stop<00:01:25.130> about<00:01:26.130> halfway

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
a circle you want to stop about halfway

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.890 
a circle you want to stop about halfway
so<00:01:27.360> you're<00:01:27.780> able<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.200> put<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:29.659> fishhook<00:01:30.659> wire

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
so you're able to put the fishhook wire

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.219 
so you're able to put the fishhook wire
on<00:01:31.170> top<00:01:32.060> after<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.390> put<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.600> fishhook<00:01:33.990> wire

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
on top after you put the fishhook wire

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.510 
on top after you put the fishhook wire
on<00:01:34.380> top<00:01:34.619> then<00:01:34.920> you're<00:01:35.070> able<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.670> make<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.780> full

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
on top then you're able to make a full

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.670 
on top then you're able to make a full
circle<00:01:38.520> with<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.000> top<00:01:39.210> now<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.170> may<00:01:40.380> take<00:01:40.619> a

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
circle with the top now this may take a

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.889 
circle with the top now this may take a
little<00:01:40.829> while<00:01:41.450> especially<00:01:42.450> if<00:01:42.720> you're<00:01:42.869> a

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
little while especially if you're a

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.139 
little while especially if you're a
beginner<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.590> it's<00:01:44.130> okay<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.520> start<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.000> over

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
beginner and it's okay to start it over
