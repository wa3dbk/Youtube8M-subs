 Well, you and you will get this 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.709

00:03:54.319 --> 00:04:05.709
 in the house we are now in this house with you 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:09.860
 but do not like a blanket take-take 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:13.250
 a blanket so bright colorful if 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:16.750
 she is so dark then no inside 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:21.829
 there will be no light at all there was darkness 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:29.630
 what about us here so everything turned out here 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:32.570
 so we have a house as if well, you probably do not 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:37.180
 very clear to watch me shoot this 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:43.250
 home but this toy is cool 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:52.190
 in short, you yourself will do it yourself 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:56.240
 see how it looks like here 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:05:00.050
 you can only lie here only 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:04.310
 you can lie still 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:11.539
 you have to do more than just enter here 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:16.820
 straight well but the window well it's not a window as it were 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:20.660
 do you have any other way without a window 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:25.310
 you will not succeed this house even if not 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:27.280
 wanna do it with a window fail 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:31.060
 no window 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:36.040
 although precisely 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:39.840
 easier to do and here is a window that 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:44.730
 it was like this open here and the window 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:48.700
 by the way if you have a TV here 

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:51.760
 right here you can or watch 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:55.240

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:58.419
 Xbox does not know in the console there you can 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:04.210
 play from this house but if you 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:08.380

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:32.669
