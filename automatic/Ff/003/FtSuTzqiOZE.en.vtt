which<00:02:36.950> you<00:02:37.099> can<00:02:37.250> probably<00:02:37.400> see<00:02:37.819> at<00:02:37.910> the<00:02:37.970> front

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
which you can probably see at the front

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.660

just<00:02:39.590> in<00:02:39.739> here<00:02:39.950> I<00:02:40.129> think<00:02:40.370> you<00:02:40.430> might<00:02:40.519> be<00:02:40.549> able

just in here I think you might be able
to<00:02:40.790> see<00:02:40.879> it<00:02:40.940> there<00:02:41.090> and<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:44.900> engines

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
to see it there and the engines

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.330 
to see it there and the engines
basically<00:02:45.980> standard<00:02:46.430> but<00:02:47.120> he's<00:02:47.239> changed<00:02:47.599> the
