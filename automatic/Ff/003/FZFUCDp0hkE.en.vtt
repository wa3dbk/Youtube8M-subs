00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
for what you don't get without the

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.880 
for what you don't get without the
gimbal<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:42.140> that<00:01:43.140> for<00:01:43.320> example<00:01:43.380> if<00:01:43.770> you're

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
gimbal is that for example if you're

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.539 
gimbal is that for example if you're
banking<00:01:44.340> with<00:01:44.549> your<00:01:44.930> with<00:01:45.930> your<00:01:45.960> DJI<00:01:46.380> phantom

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
banking with your with your DJI phantom

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:48.980 
banking with your with your DJI phantom
the<00:01:47.549> camera<00:01:47.909> is<00:01:47.939> going<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.210> bank<00:01:48.390> it's<00:01:48.869> going

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
the camera is going to bank it's going

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.749 
the camera is going to bank it's going
to<00:01:49.049> go<00:01:49.140> like<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.860> when<00:01:50.399> you're<00:01:50.610> using

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
to go like that and when you're using

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.880 
to go like that and when you're using
the<00:01:50.939> gimbal<00:01:51.329> even<00:01:52.170> if<00:01:52.290> your<00:01:52.439> phantom<00:01:52.770> is

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
the gimbal even if your phantom is

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.630 
the gimbal even if your phantom is
banked<00:01:53.189> like<00:01:53.340> that<00:01:54.170> the<00:01:55.170> camera<00:01:55.770> remains

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
banked like that the camera remains

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.499 
banked like that the camera remains
horizontal<00:01:57.799> so<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:59.579> know<00:01:59.700> all<00:01:59.909> this<00:02:00.119> going<00:02:00.329> on

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
horizontal so you know all this going on

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.260 
horizontal so you know all this going on
up<00:02:00.689> here<00:02:00.799> your<00:02:01.799> camera<00:02:02.100> is<00:02:02.310> still<00:02:02.520> horizontal

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
up here your camera is still horizontal

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.480 
up here your camera is still horizontal
because<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.780> gimbal<00:02:04.140> man<00:02:04.290> so<00:02:05.219> when<00:02:05.369> you're

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
because of the gimbal man so when you're

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.780 
because of the gimbal man so when you're
done<00:02:05.610> some<00:02:05.850> serious

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790

vision plus with the integrated camera

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.450 
vision plus with the integrated camera
that's<00:02:35.170> that's<00:02:35.560> what's<00:02:35.770> so<00:02:35.860> cool<00:02:35.890> it's<00:02:36.250> not<00:02:36.430> a

about<00:02:49.180> it<00:02:49.450> is<00:02:49.780> that<00:02:50.410> it's<00:02:50.709> integrated<00:02:51.340> into

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
about it is that it's integrated into

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.570 
about it is that it's integrated into
the<00:02:52.360> system<00:02:52.780> and<00:02:52.930> when<00:02:53.590> you're<00:02:53.740> when<00:02:54.459> you're

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
jpg really high quality images and you

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.990 
jpg really high quality images and you
can<00:03:49.510> manipulate<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:50.350> camera<00:03:50.950> the<00:03:51.549> pitch<00:03:51.790> of

built into your or i guess i call it the

accelerometer that's built into your
iphone<00:04:00.670> so<00:04:00.880> curb<00:04:01.120> when<00:04:01.630> you're<00:04:01.750> flying<00:04:01.930> if<00:04:02.260> you

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380 
iphone so curb when you're flying if you

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.020 
iphone so curb when you're flying if you
tilt<00:04:02.590> forward<00:04:03.040> it<00:04:03.160> will<00:04:03.250> you<00:04:03.549> know<00:04:03.670> the<00:04:03.790> pan

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
tilt forward it will you know the pan

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.600 
tilt forward it will you know the pan
the<00:04:04.239> camera<00:04:04.269> down<00:04:04.750> if<00:04:05.709> you<00:04:05.860> pull<00:04:06.070> back<00:04:06.280> it's

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
the camera down if you pull back it's

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.240 
the camera down if you pull back it's
going<00:04:06.730> to<00:04:06.820> lift<00:04:07.209> it<00:04:07.330> up<00:04:07.420> or<00:04:07.750> alternatively<00:04:08.350> you

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
going to lift it up or alternatively you

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.530 
going to lift it up or alternatively you
could<00:04:09.370> use<00:04:09.610> the<00:04:09.850> drag<00:04:10.530> drag<00:04:11.530> up<00:04:11.739> drag<00:04:12.010> down<00:04:12.250> p

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
could use the drag drag up drag down p
