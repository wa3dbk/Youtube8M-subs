going up against the monster DNA now I
did<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.139> video<00:00:16.410> before<00:00:16.770> of<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.520> monster<00:00:18.029> DNA<00:00:18.300> is

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
did a video before of the monster DNA is

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.810

as indestructible as to Sol Republic
tracks<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:31.020> these<00:01:31.530> are<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:32.100> prefer<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.720> build

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
tracks and these are I prefer the build

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.319 
tracks and these are I prefer the build
we're<00:01:34.560> not<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.890> build<00:01:35.130> but<00:01:35.430> just<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.759> quality

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
we're not to build but just a quality

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.020 
we're not to build but just a quality
the<00:01:36.540> look<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.049> feel<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:38.130> monster<00:01:38.549> dnas

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
the look and feel of the monster dnas

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.210 
the look and feel of the monster dnas
and<00:01:39.740> also<00:01:40.740> prefer<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.790> comfort<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.740> the<00:01:43.740> DNA's

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
and also prefer the comfort of the DNA's

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.600 
and also prefer the comfort of the DNA's
over<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.759> tracks<00:01:45.590> but<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:47.130> when<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.340> come<00:01:47.490> to

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
over the tracks but so when you come to

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.350 
over the tracks but so when you come to
sound<00:01:47.850> quality<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.540> mean<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:50.030> tracks<00:01:51.030> are<00:01:51.180> just

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
sound quality I mean the tracks are just

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:58.340 
sound quality I mean the tracks are just
a<00:01:51.450> whole<00:01:51.630> lot<00:01:51.780> better<00:01:53.270> and<00:01:54.500> the<00:01:55.500> DNA's<00:01:56.070> are<00:01:57.350> not

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
a whole lot better and the DNA's are not

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.700 
a whole lot better and the DNA's are not
very<00:01:58.560> good-looking<00:01:58.890> headphones<00:01:59.670> and<00:02:00.710> I

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
very good-looking headphones and I

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.160 
very good-looking headphones and I
really<00:02:02.399> don't<00:02:02.579> have<00:02:02.729> anything<00:02:03.170> really

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
really don't have anything really

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.920 
really don't have anything really
negative<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.520> say<00:02:05.729> about<00:02:05.759> them<00:02:06.240> it's<00:02:06.689> just

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
negative to say about them it's just

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.419 
negative to say about them it's just
only<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.229> personal<00:02:07.770> taste<00:02:08.039> when<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.369> come<00:02:08.580> to

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
only a personal taste when you come to

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.979 
only a personal taste when you come to
base<00:02:10.429> quality<00:02:10.970> and<00:02:11.180> I<00:02:11.209> like<00:02:11.420> the<00:02:11.540> quality<00:02:11.959> of

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
base quality and I like the quality of

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.360 
base quality and I like the quality of
the<00:02:12.170> tracks<00:02:12.470> HD<00:02:13.090> now<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.150> DNA's<00:02:15.189> doesn't<00:02:16.189> have

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
the tracks HD now the DNA's doesn't have

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.270 
the tracks HD now the DNA's doesn't have
as<00:02:16.549> much<00:02:16.790> base<00:02:17.560> but<00:02:18.560> they<00:02:18.680> have<00:02:18.829> some<00:02:18.980> sweet

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
as much base but they have some sweet

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.119 
as much base but they have some sweet
mids<00:02:19.610> and<00:02:19.760> highs<00:02:20.049> you<00:02:21.049> just<00:02:21.290> don't<00:02:21.560> quite<00:02:21.920> get

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
mids and highs you just don't quite get

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:25.449 
mids and highs you just don't quite get
that<00:02:22.189> sound<00:02:22.730> separation<00:02:23.569> as<00:02:24.379> good<00:02:25.069> as<00:02:25.189> you<00:02:25.310> do

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
that sound separation as good as you do

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.360 
that sound separation as good as you do
