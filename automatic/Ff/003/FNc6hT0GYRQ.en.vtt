 now I will fill in the gaps again 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.680
 this decoration looks like a kaleidoscope 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.310
 who was with us sometime with you 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.310
 childhood 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.630
 house 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:17.150
 at any time you can fix any and 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.150
 pebbles as you need 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:47.400
 Here is such a beauty I got a 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:50.129
 now send the race for two minutes for 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:54.270
 order to finish the woods now I'll take 

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:57.300
 thin brush and finish without a sticky layer 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:00.080
 finish without a sticky layer it is very liquid and 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:03.990
 yak neat between 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:08.180
 pebbles walk finish and below will 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:12.620
 flow into the gap and so 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.620
 will be fixed with additional rhinestones 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:28.770
 the more carefully you go the more 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:31.680
 guarantees that the pebbles do not fly 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:35.310
 dry again before laying 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:37.789
 I covered the rhinestones finishing foot with 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:40.169
 sticky layer and now my task 

00:06:37.789 --> 00:06:43.099
 carefully remove residual 

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:45.719
 stickiness since rhinestones are glass 

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:49.110
 no dash degreaser with acetone 

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:52.409
