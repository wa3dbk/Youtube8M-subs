00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.640
 hello to all guys the prize of this 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.850
 brand new video today I'm here for unbox 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.309
 Sardinians finally face diving suit like 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.349
 you want to call it from our shiomi y 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.240
 aicam obviously there is the link in 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:18.740
 description of Italian bamboo and 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.019
 thank you for sending this 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.939
 diving suit 60 meters deep boys 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:26.230
 the best there is what can we 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:29.979
 find in the package we find a 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.119
 adapter for mounting in various 

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:34.129
 accessories that you can try 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.050
 accessories for the register that pro however made 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:37.370
 the video there will be the link in description 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.170
 we have the ability to mount it on 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.500
 many other accessories that they have 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:45.949
 this attack here talking about the hull 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:51.769
 andro is exactly the same as the version 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:53.300
 that we find of co.pro.b to be we have 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:56.210
 possibility to disassemble even that which 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.879
 maybe even interchangeable is similar 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.809
 to the versions we have on sj can go 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.539
 pro etcetera 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.750
 we can simply insert the 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.830
 our shiomi inside and close the 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.810
 all perfect 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.050
 the thing that really surprised me are 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.180
 the keys are really easy to 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.430
 take because some like the sg income 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.640
 they are very difficult to crush e 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.320
 just be able to open turn on 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.120
 starting the recording and so on 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.370
 this could turn into a thing 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.170
 negative because maybe when we 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.090
 we have more chances to 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.280
 start start or stop 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.380
 unintentionally recording 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.600
 but they are made on purpose not to be 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.670
 accidentally touched we can 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.830
 access all the buttons 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.960
 of our shiomi frontally 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.060
 which I thought was rounded 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.060
 like the first versions of the diving suit 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.460
 del pro lake instead is not completely 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.770
 anti fogging dish what you can 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.450
 do to remedy this problem 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.000
 insert dehumidifiers 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.409
 platelets and dehumidifiers that avoid 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.079
 to reform 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.030
 the page precisely of water moisture in 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:03.829
 condensate called inside ours 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.329
 diving suit this is a problem 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:07.039
 find when for example 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:10.099
 we pass from a very high temperature 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:12.680
 a lower temperature or on the contrary 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.840
 I promised the video test and also the 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.310
 video comparison against the 4,000 se se 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.799
 you want the video comparison with the sge 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.569

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:23.239
