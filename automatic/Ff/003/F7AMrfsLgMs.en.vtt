00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.640 
than I thought it looked like crap and
the<00:04:27.270> trailer<00:04:27.570> is<00:04:27.840> but<00:04:28.050> this<00:04:28.139> one<00:04:28.320> was<00:04:28.470> actually

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
the trailer is but this one was actually

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.870 
the trailer is but this one was actually
kind<00:04:29.039> of<00:04:29.070> cool<00:04:30.889> now<00:04:31.889> I<00:04:31.919> like<00:04:32.220> this<00:04:32.400> spot<00:04:32.699> in

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
kind of cool now I like this spot in

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.900 
kind of cool now I like this spot in
this<00:04:33.060> building<00:04:33.449> right<00:04:33.599> here<00:04:34.280> you<00:04:35.280> get<00:04:35.490> so<00:04:35.759> much

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
this building right here you get so much

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:49.279 
this building right here you get so much
to<00:04:35.970> shoot<00:04:36.419> from<00:04:42.620> right

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:49.289 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:05:01.579 

wait<00:04:49.889> where<00:04:56.449> that<00:04:57.449> I<00:04:58.080> could<00:04:58.289> possibly<00:04:58.499> it<00:05:00.589> do

00:05:01.579 --> 00:05:01.589 
wait where that I could possibly it do

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:04.369 
wait where that I could possibly it do
you<00:05:01.710> have<00:05:01.979> any<00:05:02.939> remote<00:05:03.330> Carter's<00:05:03.809> as<00:05:04.080> your

00:05:04.369 --> 00:05:04.379 
you have any remote Carter's as your

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:09.290 
you have any remote Carter's as your
killstreak<00:05:06.259> well<00:05:07.639> anyways<00:05:08.639> we<00:05:08.849> were<00:05:08.969> talking

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
killstreak well anyways we were talking

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.879 
killstreak well anyways we were talking
about<00:05:09.419> is<00:05:09.749> it<00:05:09.779> looks<00:05:10.199> like<00:05:10.379> you<00:05:10.499> can<00:05:10.649> probably

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:10.889 
about is it looks like you can probably

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:12.709 
about is it looks like you can probably
there<00:05:11.309> might<00:05:11.430> be<00:05:11.460> a<00:05:11.610> path<00:05:11.909> to<00:05:12.240> where<00:05:12.479> you<00:05:12.569> can

00:05:12.709 --> 00:05:12.719 
there might be a path to where you can

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:15.290 
there might be a path to where you can
drive<00:05:13.020> the<00:05:13.229> RSC<00:05:13.649> car<00:05:13.889> through<00:05:14.759> them<00:05:14.909> to<00:05:15.119> my

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
drive the RSC car through them to my

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.659 
drive the RSC car through them to my
loop<00:05:15.960> around<00:05:16.169> somewhere<00:05:16.919> but<00:05:17.159> we<00:05:17.399> don't<00:05:17.550> know

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:17.669 
loop around somewhere but we don't know

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:20.329 
loop around somewhere but we don't know
where<00:05:18.289> but<00:05:19.289> if<00:05:19.409> you<00:05:19.499> want<00:05:19.649> to<00:05:19.740> give<00:05:19.889> it<00:05:20.009> a<00:05:20.069> try

00:05:20.329 --> 00:05:20.339 
where but if you want to give it a try

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:39.600 
where but if you want to give it a try
you<00:05:20.399> can

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:44.010 

so<00:05:40.270> that's<00:05:40.449> basically<00:05:40.719> it<00:05:41.229> for<00:05:41.469> this<00:05:41.949> map<00:05:43.020> it's

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
so that's basically it for this map it's

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:50.450 
so that's basically it for this map it's
not<00:05:44.199> a<00:05:44.259> lot<00:05:44.919> of<00:05:45.069> spaces<00:05:45.460> for<00:05:45.939> you<00:05:46.060> to<00:05:46.180> move<00:05:46.360> into

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.770 

I'll<00:05:51.460> do<00:05:51.669> there<00:05:51.879> are<00:05:51.939> some<00:05:52.090> cannons<00:05:52.539> over<00:05:52.840> here

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
I'll do there are some cannons over here

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:58.830 
I'll do there are some cannons over here
