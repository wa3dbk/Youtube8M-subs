00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
out some of the forums right now and you

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.299 
out some of the forums right now and you
know<00:01:02.370> one<00:01:02.699> of<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.879> suggestions<00:01:03.359> was<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:04.309> use

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
know one of the suggestions was to use

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.080 
know one of the suggestions was to use
them<00:01:06.229> some<00:01:07.229> are<00:01:07.409> more<00:01:07.530> ologists<00:01:08.159> because<00:01:08.909> it's

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
them some are more ologists because it's

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.060 
them some are more ologists because it's
a<00:01:09.210> chemical<00:01:09.780> reaction<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.380> guess<00:01:10.590> that's<00:01:10.830> going

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
a chemical reaction I guess that's going

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.660 
a chemical reaction I guess that's going
on<00:01:11.159> between<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.780> rubber<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.590> skin<00:01:14.340> here

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
just really see how oily that is in

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:07.069 
just really see how oily that is in
there<00:01:56.070> and<00:02:04.579> yep<00:02:05.579> so<00:02:06.509> I<00:02:06.570> don't<00:02:06.719> even<00:02:06.810> know<00:02:06.990> how

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
there and yep so I don't even know how

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.469 
there and yep so I don't even know how
to<00:02:07.110> take<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.439> armor<00:02:07.710> off<00:02:07.910> another<00:02:08.910> idea<00:02:09.239> was

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
to take the armor off another idea was

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.190 
to take the armor off another idea was
to<00:02:09.840> just<00:02:10.110> switch<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.099> armor<00:02:11.430> out<00:02:11.459> with

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
to just switch the armor out with

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
to just switch the armor out with
probably<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.319> D<00:02:13.500> cedar

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
probably the D cedar

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.060 
probably the D cedar
twelve<00:02:15.820> or<00:02:16.060> thirteen<00:02:16.420> inch<00:02:16.570> version<00:02:17.020> I<00:02:17.260> don't

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
twelve or thirteen inch version I don't

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.530 
twelve or thirteen inch version I don't
think<00:02:18.220> it's<00:02:18.340> a<00:02:18.520> exact<00:02:19.360> fit<00:02:19.750> but<00:02:20.080> it's<00:02:20.980> probably

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
think it's a exact fit but it's probably

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.170 
think it's a exact fit but it's probably
another<00:02:22.540> option<00:02:23.020> that<00:02:23.260> we<00:02:23.590> can<00:02:23.740> go<00:02:23.920> if<00:02:24.180> I'm

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
another option that we can go if I'm

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.910 
another option that we can go if I'm
going<00:02:25.330> to<00:02:25.390> try<00:02:25.600> to<00:02:25.660> take<00:02:26.080> it<00:02:26.230> apart<00:02:26.530> and<00:02:26.740> do<00:02:26.800> the

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
going to try to take it apart and do the

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.020 
going to try to take it apart and do the
