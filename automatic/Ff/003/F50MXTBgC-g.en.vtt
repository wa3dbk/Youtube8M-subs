00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.499 
you tell us how it went I went pretty
well<00:00:20.800> we<00:00:21.460> started<00:00:21.759> off<00:00:21.910> a<00:00:21.970> little<00:00:22.029> bit<00:00:22.270> slow<00:00:22.480> in

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:22.509 
well we started off a little bit slow in

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:23.880 
well we started off a little bit slow in
the<00:00:22.689> second<00:00:22.989> practice<00:00:23.110> because<00:00:23.560> we<00:00:23.650> were<00:00:23.739> so

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
the second practice because we were so

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.709 
the second practice because we were so
fatigued<00:00:24.220> from<00:00:24.369> the<00:00:24.520> first<00:00:24.730> one<00:00:24.910> but<00:00:25.509> at<00:00:25.599> the

00:00:25.709 --> 00:00:25.719 
fatigued from the first one but at the

00:00:25.719 --> 00:00:26.970 
fatigued from the first one but at the
end<00:00:25.840> of<00:00:25.989> practice<00:00:26.140> we<00:00:26.410> really<00:00:26.590> picked<00:00:26.770> it<00:00:26.890> up

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
end of practice we really picked it up

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.700 
end of practice we really picked it up
and<00:00:27.189> the<00:00:27.790> tempo<00:00:28.090> was<00:00:28.180> great<00:00:28.419> and<00:00:29.140> Chris<00:00:29.469> what

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710 
and the tempo was great and Chris what

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:30.929 
and the tempo was great and Chris what
are<00:00:29.739> your<00:00:29.950> thoughts<00:00:30.129> here<00:00:30.340> on<00:00:30.640> the<00:00:30.790> first

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:30.939 
are your thoughts here on the first

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:32.970 
are your thoughts here on the first
devil<00:00:31.270> day<00:00:31.360> account<00:00:31.719> I<00:00:31.960> think<00:00:32.710> they<00:00:32.800> were<00:00:32.920> a

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
devil day account I think they were a

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.350 
devil day account I think they were a
little<00:00:33.039> bit<00:00:33.250> challenging<00:00:33.700> but<00:00:33.969> I<00:00:34.000> think<00:00:34.270> we

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
little bit challenging but I think we

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.900 
little bit challenging but I think we
all<00:00:34.390> got<00:00:34.539> through<00:00:34.899> it<00:00:34.930> and<00:00:35.460> we<00:00:36.460> went<00:00:36.700> through

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
all got through it and we went through

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.970 
all got through it and we went through
at<00:00:37.329> a<00:00:37.390> great<00:00:37.690> pace<00:00:37.870> in<00:00:38.230> the<00:00:38.289> first<00:00:38.590> practice

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
at a great pace in the first practice

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.290 
at a great pace in the first practice
and<00:00:39.160> then<00:00:39.250> second<00:00:39.550> practice<00:00:39.670> to<00:00:39.940> start<00:00:39.969> off<00:00:40.210> a

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
and then second practice to start off a

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.640 
and then second practice to start off a
little<00:00:40.420> bit<00:00:40.570> slow<00:00:40.780> but<00:00:41.050> then<00:00:41.199> we<00:00:41.320> started<00:00:41.469> to

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650 
little bit slow but then we started to

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.340 
little bit slow but then we started to
regain<00:00:42.010> our<00:00:42.190> focus<00:00:42.640> and<00:00:42.850> pick<00:00:43.210> it<00:00:43.300> up<00:00:43.390> but

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
regain our focus and pick it up but

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.380 
regain our focus and pick it up but
bryson<00:00:44.800> general<00:00:45.220> compared<00:00:45.670> to<00:00:45.850> like<00:00:46.000> you<00:00:46.360> know

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
bryson general compared to like you know

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.069 
bryson general compared to like you know
high<00:00:46.660> school<00:00:47.020> and<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.910> know<00:00:49.030> any<00:00:49.720> ball<00:00:49.960> you

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
high school and you know any ball you

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:51.960 
high school and you know any ball you
played<00:00:50.290> before<00:00:50.470> what's<00:00:51.160> the<00:00:51.280> intensity<00:00:51.850> and

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:51.970 
played before what's the intensity and

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.550 
played before what's the intensity and
the<00:00:52.060> tempo<00:00:52.450> of<00:00:52.540> these<00:00:52.720> practices<00:00:53.320> in

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:53.560 
the tempo of these practices in

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.650 
the tempo of these practices in
comparison<00:00:54.399> to<00:00:54.489> that<00:00:54.520> that's<00:00:55.239> a<00:00:55.360> lot<00:00:55.510> more

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
comparison to that that's a lot more

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.530 
comparison to that that's a lot more
fast<00:00:55.989> the<00:00:56.620> transition<00:00:57.610> between<00:00:57.640> periods<00:00:58.210> are

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
fast the transition between periods are

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.690 
fast the transition between periods are
a<00:00:59.320> lot<00:00:59.500> a<00:00:59.680> lot<00:00:59.920> more<00:01:00.070> rapid<00:01:00.430> than<00:01:00.460> they<00:01:00.610> are<00:01:00.670> on

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 
a lot a lot more rapid than they are on

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.400 
a lot a lot more rapid than they are on
high<00:01:00.880> school<00:01:01.120> because<00:01:01.540> we<00:01:01.840> have<00:01:01.930> a<00:01:01.960> specific

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
high school because we have a specific

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.229 
high school because we have a specific
segment<00:01:03.070> clock<00:01:03.250> and<00:01:03.640> we<00:01:03.850> don't<00:01:03.910> have<00:01:04.030> one<00:01:04.180> of

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
segment clock and we don't have one of

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.450 
segment clock and we don't have one of
those<00:01:04.360> in<00:01:04.509> high<00:01:04.600> school<00:01:05.130> Chris<00:01:06.130> do<00:01:06.250> you<00:01:06.280> see

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
those in high school Chris do you see

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.399 
those in high school Chris do you see
these<00:01:06.579> practices<00:01:07.060> is<00:01:07.240> being<00:01:07.570> more<00:01:07.810> efficient

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
these practices is being more efficient

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:09.690 
these practices is being more efficient
like<00:01:08.560> you're<00:01:08.740> getting<00:01:09.009> the<00:01:09.100> most<00:01:09.250> out<00:01:09.490> of<00:01:09.549> the

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
like you're getting the most out of the

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.209 
like you're getting the most out of the
time<00:01:09.729> that<00:01:10.149> you're<00:01:10.240> out<00:01:10.390> here<00:01:10.710> yes<00:01:11.710> I<00:01:11.890> do<00:01:11.950> see

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:12.219 
time that you're out here yes I do see

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:14.520 
time that you're out here yes I do see
them<00:01:12.280> as<00:01:12.430> more<00:01:12.610> efficient<00:01:13.000> because<00:01:13.530> from

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
them as more efficient because from

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.959 
them as more efficient because from
Jonah<00:01:14.799> drill<00:01:15.100> we<00:01:15.280> run<00:01:15.459> a<00:01:15.490> little<00:01:15.670> bit<00:01:15.850> faster

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:15.969 
Jonah drill we run a little bit faster

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:18.120 
Jonah drill we run a little bit faster
than<00:01:16.179> we<00:01:16.389> did<00:01:16.509> in<00:01:16.569> high<00:01:16.749> school<00:01:16.780> and<00:01:17.229> uh<00:01:17.289> I

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
than we did in high school and uh I

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.459 
than we did in high school and uh I
guess<00:01:18.609> the<00:01:18.759> time<00:01:18.999> the<00:01:19.509> time<00:01:19.539> that<00:01:19.899> it<00:01:19.990> takes<00:01:20.139> to

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:20.469 
guess the time the time that it takes to

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:22.379 
guess the time the time that it takes to
get<00:01:20.679> from<00:01:20.740> dreaded<00:01:21.130> drill<00:01:21.310> it<00:01:21.549> you<00:01:22.060> get<00:01:22.209> more

00:01:22.379 --> 00:01:22.389 
get from dreaded drill it you get more

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:26.340 
get from dreaded drill it you get more
stuff<00:01:22.630> done<00:01:22.689> when<00:01:23.530> you<00:01:24.009> hustle<00:01:24.609> oh<00:01:25.079> now<00:01:26.079> Bryce
