00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.160 

you<00:01:07.160> gotta<00:01:07.370> love<00:01:07.580> a<00:01:07.640> racing<00:01:08.090> game<00:01:08.330> where<00:01:09.020> the

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
you gotta love a racing game where the

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.710 
you gotta love a racing game where the
two<00:01:09.350> button<00:01:09.680> controls<00:01:10.100> are<00:01:10.340> fast<00:01:10.730> and<00:01:11.090> faster

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
two button controls are fast and faster

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.380 
two button controls are fast and faster
and<00:01:12.200> that's<00:01:13.100> a<00:01:13.280> case<00:01:13.430> of<00:01:13.580> Excitebike<00:01:14.030> there<00:01:14.270> is

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
and that's a case of Excitebike there is

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.590 
and that's a case of Excitebike there is
no<00:01:14.540> break<00:01:14.780> button

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
no break button

the d-pad to move your driver about and
you<00:02:08.600> use<00:02:08.810> a<00:02:09.019> to<00:02:09.979> accelerate<00:02:10.670> and<00:02:10.850> B<00:02:11.239> to

you use a to accelerate and B to
accelerate<00:02:12.049> even<00:02:12.350> faster<00:02:12.769> when<00:02:13.670> you

accelerate faster with B your
temperature<00:02:15.739> gauge<00:02:15.890> also<00:02:16.160> Rises<00:02:16.760> and

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
temperature gauge also Rises and

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.820 
temperature gauge also Rises and
therefore<00:02:17.959> your<00:02:18.049> temperature<00:02:18.380> gauge<00:02:18.500> fills

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
therefore your temperature gauge fills

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.590 
therefore your temperature gauge fills

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
all the way up in red then you have to

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.030 
all the way up in red then you have to
pull<00:02:20.750> over<00:02:20.870> for<00:02:20.989> a<00:02:21.170> few<00:02:21.380> seconds<00:02:21.739> while<00:02:21.830> your

pull over for a few seconds while your

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:38.610 
pull over for a few seconds while your
bike<00:02:22.220> cools<00:02:22.489> off

makes<00:03:26.360> depending<00:03:26.750> on<00:03:26.810> what<00:03:26.930> type<00:03:27.050> of<00:03:27.080> terrain

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
makes depending on what type of terrain

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.880 
makes depending on what type of terrain
you're<00:03:27.680> on<00:03:27.830> and<00:03:28.310> that's<00:03:29.270> about<00:03:29.420> it<00:03:29.800> but<00:03:30.800> I

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
you're on and that's about it but I

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.440 
you're on and that's about it but I
think<00:03:30.950> in<00:03:31.160> a<00:03:31.250> game<00:03:31.280> like<00:03:31.520> excite<00:03:31.880> bike<00:03:32.030> less<00:03:32.300> is

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
think in a game like excite bike less is

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.870 
think in a game like excite bike less is
more<00:03:32.720> I<00:03:32.990> think<00:03:33.770> if<00:03:34.010> they<00:03:34.130> included<00:03:34.520> the<00:03:34.640> cheesy

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
more I think if they included the cheesy

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.080 
more I think if they included the cheesy
musical<00:03:35.510> score<00:03:35.750> behind<00:03:36.170> you<00:03:36.380> while<00:03:36.560> you<00:03:36.710> raced

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
musical score behind you while you raced

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.040 
musical score behind you while you raced
will<00:03:38.090> definitely<00:03:38.540> take<00:03:38.720> away<00:03:38.990> from<00:03:39.170> the<00:03:39.260> game

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
will definitely take away from the game

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.050 
will definitely take away from the game
now<00:03:41.530> it<00:03:41.680> should<00:03:41.890> be<00:03:41.920> noted<00:03:42.310> that<00:03:42.340> Excitebike

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
now if we select the design mode and go

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.550 
now if we select the design mode and go
down<00:04:49.240> to<00:04:49.270> design<00:04:49.630> and<00:04:50.200> hit<00:04:51.160> start<00:04:51.490> we<00:04:52.240> can

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
down to design and hit start we can

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.610 
down to design and hit start we can
program<00:04:53.560> our<00:04:53.800> own<00:04:54.010> track<00:04:54.490> and<00:04:55.380> that<00:04:56.380> was<00:04:56.590> a

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
program our own track and that was a

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.890 
program our own track and that was a
really<00:04:57.100> cool<00:04:57.340> feature<00:04:57.669> in<00:04:59.070> 1984-1985

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
really cool feature in 1984-1985

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.480 
really cool feature in 1984-1985
now<00:05:01.900> this<00:05:02.110> track<00:05:02.440> design<00:05:02.770> feature<00:05:03.040> is<00:05:03.310> very

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
now this track design feature is very

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.250 
now this track design feature is very
primitive<00:05:03.820> by<00:05:04.240> today's<00:05:04.270> standards<00:05:05.020> there's

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
primitive by today's standards there's

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.280 
primitive by today's standards there's
only<00:05:05.350> 19<00:05:05.890> options<00:05:06.370> that<00:05:07.330> you<00:05:07.450> can<00:05:07.600> place<00:05:07.960> on

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
only 19 options that you can place on

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.760 
only 19 options that you can place on
the<00:05:08.620> track<00:05:09.630> but<00:05:10.630> this<00:05:10.900> little<00:05:11.110> feature<00:05:11.380> is

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
the track but this little feature is

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.820 
the track but this little feature is
what<00:05:12.130> made<00:05:12.310> this<00:05:12.520> game<00:05:12.820> really<00:05:13.720> cool<00:05:13.960> a<00:05:14.290> lot<00:05:14.740> of

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
what made this game really cool a lot of

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.230 
what made this game really cool a lot of
people<00:05:15.070> talked<00:05:15.310> about<00:05:15.430> this<00:05:15.669> game<00:05:15.940> when<00:05:16.150> it

recorder<00:05:41.050> which<00:05:41.830> was<00:05:42.010> a<00:05:42.040> peripheral

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
recorder which was a peripheral

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.600 
recorder which was a peripheral
available<00:05:43.540> only<00:05:43.810> in<00:05:43.930> Japan<00:05:44.290> and<00:05:44.590> that<00:05:45.490> was

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.610 
available only in Japan and that was

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.790 
available only in Japan and that was
basically<00:05:45.820> a<00:05:46.330> cassette<00:05:46.870> recorder<00:05:47.380> that

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
basically a cassette recorder that

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.580 
basically a cassette recorder that
plugged<00:05:48.130> into<00:05:48.310> your<00:05:48.520> Famicom<00:05:49.270> and<00:05:49.780> you<00:05:50.470> can

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
plugged into your Famicom and you can

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.830 
plugged into your Famicom and you can
basically<00:05:50.740> save<00:05:51.310> the<00:05:51.520> data<00:05:51.790> of<00:05:52.060> your<00:05:52.090> track<00:05:52.510> on

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
basically save the data of your track on

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.780 
basically save the data of your track on
any<00:05:53.169> standard<00:05:53.830> audio<00:05:54.220> cassette<00:05:54.760> tape

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:56.790 
any standard audio cassette tape

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.120 
any standard audio cassette tape
but<00:05:57.360> basically<00:05:57.600> only<00:05:58.200> three<00:05:58.530> games<00:05:58.770> had

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130 
but basically only three games had

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.130 
but basically only three games had
functionality<00:05:59.970> with<00:06:00.150> the<00:06:00.180> Famicom<00:06:00.840> data

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:01.140 
functionality with the Famicom data

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.980 
functionality with the Famicom data
recorder<00:06:01.650> and<00:06:01.860> they<00:06:02.730> were<00:06:02.790> excited<00:06:03.450> by<00:06:03.570> mock

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990 
recorder and they were excited by mock

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.730 
recorder and they were excited by mock
rider<00:06:04.320> and<00:06:04.620> Wrecking<00:06:05.370> Crew<00:06:06.740> but

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
rider and Wrecking Crew but

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.380 
rider and Wrecking Crew but
unfortunately<00:06:08.490> this<00:06:08.640> device<00:06:09.000> was<00:06:09.210> never

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:09.390 
unfortunately this device was never

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:13.490 
unfortunately this device was never
available<00:06:09.690> outside<00:06:10.110> of<00:06:10.380> Japan<00:06:12.170> so<00:06:13.170> every<00:06:13.380> time

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500 
available outside of Japan so every time

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.140 
available outside of Japan so every time
you<00:06:13.650> wanted<00:06:13.860> to<00:06:13.950> play<00:06:14.130> a<00:06:14.160> custom<00:06:14.760> track<00:06:14.970> you

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:15.150 
you wanted to play a custom track you

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.030 
you wanted to play a custom track you
had<00:06:15.270> to<00:06:15.360> actually<00:06:15.690> sit<00:06:15.870> down<00:06:15.900> and<00:06:16.260> program<00:06:16.920> it

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:17.040 
had to actually sit down and program it

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.670 
had to actually sit down and program it
on<00:06:17.160> the<00:06:17.310> spot<00:06:17.580> and<00:06:17.790> then<00:06:17.970> sit<00:06:18.210> and<00:06:18.240> play<00:06:18.540> it<00:06:18.720> if

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 
on the spot and then sit and play it if

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.140 
on the spot and then sit and play it if
you<00:06:19.890> turn<00:06:20.100> the<00:06:20.220> power<00:06:20.370> off<00:06:20.490> on<00:06:20.730> your<00:06:20.850> system

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.150 
you turn the power off on your system

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.210 
you turn the power off on your system
you<00:06:21.180> lose<00:06:21.570> the<00:06:21.780> custom<00:06:22.260> track<00:06:22.500> data<00:06:22.740> and<00:06:23.070> have

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.220 
you lose the custom track data and have

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.630 
you lose the custom track data and have
to<00:06:23.310> start<00:06:23.550> all<00:06:23.670> over<00:06:23.700> again<00:06:25.310> so<00:06:26.310> the<00:06:26.490> big

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:26.640 
to start all over again so the big

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.580 
to start all over again so the big
question<00:06:26.790> is<00:06:27.180> how<00:06:27.450> does<00:06:27.510> Excitebike<00:06:28.170> hold<00:06:28.440> up

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:28.590 
question is how does Excitebike hold up

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.490 
question is how does Excitebike hold up
today<00:06:28.890> and<00:06:29.340> to<00:06:30.090> be<00:06:30.120> quite<00:06:30.420> honest<00:06:30.810> not<00:06:31.230> that

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:31.500 
today and to be quite honest not that

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.610 
today and to be quite honest not that
well<00:06:31.820> other<00:06:32.820> than<00:06:33.120> for<00:06:33.450> nostalgic<00:06:34.050> purposes<00:06:34.200> I

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.620 
well other than for nostalgic purposes I

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.230 
well other than for nostalgic purposes I
didn't<00:06:35.280> have<00:06:35.370> that<00:06:35.520> much<00:06:35.640> fun<00:06:35.790> playing<00:06:35.970> the

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 
didn't have that much fun playing the

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.530 
didn't have that much fun playing the
game<00:06:37.430> and<00:06:38.430> my<00:06:38.610> biggest<00:06:38.790> complaint<00:06:39.270> with<00:06:39.360> it

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:39.540 
game and my biggest complaint with it

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.450 
game and my biggest complaint with it
was<00:06:40.050> that<00:06:40.080> there<00:06:40.290> was<00:06:40.410> no<00:06:40.530> two-player<00:06:41.010> versus

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:41.460 
was that there was no two-player versus

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.120 
was that there was no two-player versus
mode<00:06:41.960> that<00:06:42.960> would<00:06:43.080> have<00:06:43.200> definitely<00:06:43.320> changed

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:44.130 
mode that would have definitely changed

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:47.060 
mode that would have definitely changed
my<00:06:44.250> opinion<00:06:44.430> about<00:06:44.670> Excitebike<00:06:45.500> the<00:06:46.500> one<00:06:46.860> big

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:47.070 
my opinion about Excitebike the one big

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.010 
my opinion about Excitebike the one big
draw<00:06:47.310> of<00:06:47.460> the<00:06:47.550> game<00:06:47.730> was<00:06:48.150> the<00:06:48.180> programmable

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.020 
draw of the game was the programmable

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:52.430 
draw of the game was the programmable
mode<00:06:49.260> but<00:06:49.800> 25<00:06:50.250> years<00:06:50.550> later<00:06:51.020> it<00:06:52.020> doesn't<00:06:52.230> have

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.440 
mode but 25 years later it doesn't have

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.060 
mode but 25 years later it doesn't have
that<00:06:52.530> much<00:06:52.680> of<00:06:52.800> a<00:06:52.860> draw<00:06:54.260> but<00:06:55.260> the<00:06:55.410> good<00:06:55.560> news<00:06:55.830> is

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:56.070 
that much of a draw but the good news is

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:58.100 
that much of a draw but the good news is
that<00:06:56.280> there<00:06:56.790> are<00:06:56.970> plenty<00:06:57.330> of<00:06:57.600> copies<00:06:57.870> of

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.110 
that there are plenty of copies of

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.960 
that there are plenty of copies of
Excitebike<00:06:58.620> around<00:06:58.950> and<00:06:59.280> you<00:06:59.520> can<00:06:59.610> get<00:06:59.670> a<00:06:59.730> copy

00:06:59.960 --> 00:06:59.970 
Excitebike around and you can get a copy

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:04.940 
Excitebike around and you can get a copy
fairly<00:07:00.540> cheaply<00:07:00.810> for<00:07:01.650> under<00:07:01.950> $2<00:07:02.550> I'd<00:07:03.210> say<00:07:03.950> if

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:04.950 
fairly cheaply for under $2 I'd say if

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:05.960 
fairly cheaply for under $2 I'd say if
you<00:07:05.160> want<00:07:05.340> to<00:07:05.400> pick<00:07:05.490> it<00:07:05.580> up<00:07:05.640> for<00:07:05.790> the<00:07:05.880> Wii

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:05.970 
you want to pick it up for the Wii

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:08.330 
you want to pick it up for the Wii
Virtual<00:07:06.210> Console<00:07:06.810> that<00:07:07.350> would<00:07:07.470> cost<00:07:07.680> you<00:07:07.860> 500

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:08.340

Virtual Console that would cost you 500
Wii<00:07:08.430> Points<00:07:08.660> which<00:07:09.660> is<00:07:09.810> roughly<00:07:10.080> equivalent

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:10.200 
Wii Points which is roughly equivalent

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.790 
Wii Points which is roughly equivalent
to<00:07:10.560> $5<00:07:12.020> but<00:07:13.020> if<00:07:13.140> you're<00:07:13.290> playing<00:07:13.440> this<00:07:13.620> on<00:07:13.740> the

to $5 but if you're playing this on the

Wii you do have the option of saving the

Wii you do have the option of saving the

custom tracks to your hard drive which
is<00:07:17.850> definitely<00:07:18.180> a<00:07:18.450> nice<00:07:18.600> feature

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:20.220 
is definitely a nice feature
