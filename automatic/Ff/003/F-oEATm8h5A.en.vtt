00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
 hi girls and guys how are you 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.859
 I hope you are great for a 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.600
 special video about clothes that we can 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.309
 use both in the winter and in the 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.110
 summer the idea of ​​this video in other 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.910
 things came to me from seeing that always my 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.440
 wardrobe there are some clothes that do not 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.480
 either move there or if you do not go through the 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.550
 process of we put fit under the 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.289
 bed or climbed antillo but always 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.000
 they remain in my closet and I said 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.890
 because these are so privileged not 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.390
 You are always here and I thought good 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.099
 they are here because precisely those that 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.750
 uses both in the summer and in the 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.160
 winter so I'll show you three 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.689
 clothes that are always in my closet 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.040
 and that you can use them in any 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.570
 of the two epochs, surely you have a 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.829
 lots of clothes if you are several and 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.829
 let's give it another chance 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.080
 we go with the first of these garments 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.910
 that is missing as you see a cut 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.110
 kind to have a little pucker because 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.270
 has a rubber band here in the 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.530
 waist this skirt I have it so much in 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.050
 garnet color like in this color like 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.190
 bluish green is not a skirt 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.660
 american apparel the truth is that the 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.190
 I always have in my closet because the 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.870
 little look both in the winter as in 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.400
 the summer as you see the look that I now 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.720
 same is a totally winter look 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.190
 and you can imagine that right now 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.350
 they bring you an awesome heat 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.210
 but everything is for the cause because if 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.220
 Well, as you can see, this look is very 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.990
 winter I have combined it with a shirt 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.150
 white on top of a jacket in colors 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.860
 blacks with gold stripes and yes 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.600
 although it 's winter I touch like that 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.369
 color and a little bit more festive I like it 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.050
 give it to her in this case with these shoes 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.970
 of heels that they have as a kind of 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.560
 glitter to finish you added a 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:27.410
 small pendant and a bag to go to 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:29.060
 work to create a more 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.100
 summery with that same skirt first thing 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.869
 what I would do would obviously be to take away 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.729
 socks let the legs look in the air and 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.740
 that the following are very cool 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.840
 join them match them with clothes a lot 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.210
 more summery in this case as you see I have 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.580
 chosen a short sleeve top 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.770
 with a lace here on the sides and 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.600
 another down on the shirt another point 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.000
 would be the color as you see has added 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.619
 Accessories both collar bracelets lo 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.060
 which is the bag and the sandals that 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.070
 has colors with a lot of strength and 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.810
 very summery and why do not you pick up the 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.810
 hair and so you are also cooler 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.490
 another garment that never comes out of my closet 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.679
 are these shorts in cowboy color a 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.420
 pretty dark color and a length 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.489
 pretty good that is , they are not and super 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.230
 super clear cords and therefore the 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.430
 It can be used in the winter as 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.140
 in the summer as you see in this look 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.610
 winter and used a sleeve blouse 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.560
 long and I have put over it a 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.570
 wool vest that is quite warm 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.570
 on the feet chosen flat shoes 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:35.180
 and this would be the summer version for 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.560
 this short as you see I followed the 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.690
 same parameters that I have chosen before 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.580
 a blouse to combine sleeveless 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.380
 say short sleeve that had a color 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.420
 more variant because we are in summer in 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.980
 the feet also a footwear more own 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.560
 of summer how are these sandals with 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.720
 certain 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.130
 that leaves your feet pretty much in the air and 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.989
 then also accessories as per 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.459
 example this little bag that is made of material 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.930
 well canvas style that is very own 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.099
 also of summer for those who 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.660
 like the hats you always have the 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:59.459
 option to add is a cap to the look and 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.750
 well finish rounding not to me the 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.220
 truth is that I did not just see with 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.599
 these system cap buy it cut 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.250
 English and I do not know what to do with him but 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.510
 well here I sent you one that combines it 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:17.010
 jce with hats you'll see how 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:18.720
 garments are extended all season and 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.100
 these others wear this blazer that 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.510
 you see in a more central color what is 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.340
 usually used throughout the year 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.930
 As you can see, the set I wear is more 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.040
 of winter and that's why what I've done has 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.350
 been combine it with darker shades 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.940
 how is the garnet and the black in this 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.560
 case the role of the blazer would be more 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.730
 well give light to the whole that the 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.440
 You see that chosen in pretty shades 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:42.450
 off with the blazer and with the bag 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:44.069
 we would give a little more light and that 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.690
 it would be the summery version of this look 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.760
 in this case contrary to the previous 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.739
 as you see the beige color of the American 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.000
 what it does is turn off the tones a little 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.710
 before it gave light true 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.810
 does the opposite to pay a little bit to give 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.250
 more seriousness to the set than it has 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.870
 more more vibrant colors like 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.940
 blue and the turquoises chosen for 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.500
 top of gaza points then the 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.390
 pants with a multiva print 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.380
 you will see some sandals and this world bag 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.380
 I'll make it perfect for summer 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.860
 and until here we have arrived with this 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.300
 video showing the three items that 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.800
 they remain in my closet throughout 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.209
 all year round and good to be clear that 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.130
 I have quite a few more clothes that make 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.359
 this same function and if I see that you like 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.799
 Well , other videos of this style 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.970
