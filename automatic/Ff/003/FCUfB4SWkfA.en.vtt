00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 Hello, I am Alexander Guschin and with you 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.310
 film project today is real 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.310
 cinema 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.960
 news from the front work on 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.510
 continuations of the avatar by words 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.760
 director james cameron development 3 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.949
 the script in the upcoming pictures demanded 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.289
 much more time were maybe 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:28.660
 loot than it was previously supposed 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.090
 and just for this reason the sequel premiere 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.449
 again transferred to the year ahead that is 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.129
 for 2017 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:37.750
 Well, there is not far off returning cameras 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:40.540
 Well, all rights to the terminator 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.610
 unusual to get a crossover 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.160
 better than family simpsons 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.510
 or even better than semxorah bite my 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.079
 shiny metal behind 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.030
 they are better on the Internet appeared 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.290
 quite a curious rumor that is extremely 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.989
 feature film batman vs 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:01:00.750
 Superman can be divided into 2 parts 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:03.309
 sorry for the indiscreet question but it's like 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.860
 okay there are accumulated potters 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.850
 not until rolled twilight and other not 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.560
 good games 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.429
 and here also it turns out that afflek 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.380
 Superman split the output probably 

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:17.110
 first there will be a batman movie and then 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.770
 superman or the plot is so saturated 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.590
 characters 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.690
 which requires more screen in time or 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.330
 perhaps work on the script requires 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.780
 much more dough that is time 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:31.000
 well, just like the cameras on the way u 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.840
 the avengers era of altron quite recently 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.840
 new trailer released 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:41.330
 Wow, how trying to seem brutal 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.970
 guys from marvel right without sparing the viewer 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.810
 pour on the screen dark tones when money 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.330
 trailer 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:51.100
 and thriller by the way you do not tell 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.100
 age rating of this picture 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.770
 it is also worth noting earlier 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.140
 example teasers man-ant movie 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.720
 which caused the stormy Internet 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.610
 Well, the discussion is roughly the same 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.610
 sad as the teaser himself 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:11.429
 I am begging you 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.429
 stand up human ant 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.270
 frankly I hope that in the very 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.980
 film mood will be a little different well 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:25.160
 but for now it's probably comparable to the halk 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:29.040
 2003 to say the least not a fountain 10 times 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:32.300
 we are tammy after all change yes interesting 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.310
 who will be the antagonist man anteater 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.349
 Well , who is really brutal? 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.660
 this is michael kiton feature film 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:42.000
 Byrdman as if not weakly hinting at 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.560
 the filmography of the actor himself grabbed 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.720
 currently have two golden globes and 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:54.060
 respectively nominated for an oscar 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:56.130
 categories best movie rest not 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.170
 want a little and some still 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:10.140
 argue who was really the most 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:19.850
 cool batman think the answer is obvious here 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:19.850
 so or not obvious 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:28.590
 take off the extreme role of actor michael 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.110
 whale can be identified remake robocop 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.930
 2014 as an example of an extremely 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.680
 negative and part of the film nps thirst 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.870
 speeds 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.520
 as an example very positive but there at 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.890
 he had such a role as if he were just 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.260
 at home and skype did not go out and they took him 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.360
 by the way about skype company basileus 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.590
 Timura Bekmambetova Commonwealth with 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.590
 mtv channel 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.590
 released trailer thriller and about skype 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.490
 cool Russian film director 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.380
 Andrei Zvyagintsev can also 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.600
 boast gold wanted to say 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.030
 an atlas globe and an oscar nomination 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.830
 categories best foreign film but in 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.080
 In this case, you can only rejoice 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:22.020
 only one that all sorts of bondarch and and 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:24.480
 Mikhalkovs now probably bite their elbows 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.610
 I probably like most of you this 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.830
 The tape has already been watched and besides a large 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.860
 the number of positive points I have 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.780
 there is a huge huge number of claims 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.000
 but which we'll talk about sometime in 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.610
 next time it's worth announcing that 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.100
 you are expected by some ethers about oscar 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.990
 most likely golden raspberries and other 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.690
 leviathans don't know how it will be 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:49.440
 look even possible within the direct 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:51.240
 broadcasts drinking water come on lime 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.950
 unofficial sponsor of the broadcast 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.950
 Golden Raspberry Award 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.219

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:46.139
 this excuse me for expressing the viewers 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:49.289
 gloomy tones are pouring on the screen 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:52.019
 Salvage lack of time to work on 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:55.519
 a script like a Russian camera 

00:05:52.019 --> 00:05:55.519

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.650
