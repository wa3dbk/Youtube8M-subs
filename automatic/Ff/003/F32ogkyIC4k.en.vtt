00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:12.280
 dear to tarnow who bye and welcome back here 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:15.340
 and claudio who speaks today I want you 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.920
 talk about agreements and in particular of 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.930
 so-called majors seven agreements which 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.330
 you may have heard of 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.340
 you may have met somewhere 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.410
 part browsing the internet 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.290
 I want to explain to you quickly what I am 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.599
 but above all to offer you some positions 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.739
 of major seven agreements in first 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:35.649
 position 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.450
 I recommend always look at the lessons 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:39.579
 on the site directly on lessons 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.129
 guitar punto.it because there are often 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:42.730
 of additional materials that are not there 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:45.340
 on Youtube 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.309
 and please share my every lesson 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:51.010
 to allow me to go on with 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.699
 this work and supports me in this 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.679
 way 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:56.429
 let us see then what these agreements 

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:56.429
 image of seven 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.800
 therefore a very fast theoretical premise 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.500
 major agreements are those that serve 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.300
 in Italian we call 7 more then I would have 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.660
 maybe found on some songbooks 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.330
 type agreements do 7 more la7 more 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:17.560
 here is a kind of enough wording 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:19.479
 incorrect then an Italian way 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.360
 correct to call them could be 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:25.060
 seventh major chords often 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.410
 they are called by definition 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.810
 English of major 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.390
 therefore we use this type of 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.130
 definition what are agreements are 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.430
 precisely greater than they have to their own 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.350
 inside a seventh major what is it 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.649
 the flower week is fast 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.780
 note that there is a semitone below the 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:45.580
 tonic therefore in this definition not 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.229
 it is the maximum of correctness that you 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.840
 I'm giving but I want to see this video 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.240
 make you understand what we're talking about 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.680
 in practice then if we take a 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.780
 agreement of of do 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.060
 let's go a semitone down we will get the 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.400
 note nor is the note that I will 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.290
 introduce in my agreement to do for 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.610
 get a do major set 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.729
 so let's take an example on a do 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:09.009
 greater if I remove the index they get 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.280
 an empty yes the rope is empty and therefore 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.470
 I will have a do 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.530
 major seven instead of playing the chord 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.310
 with the usual normal fingering I go 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.310
 to remove the index 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.390
 feeling the sound is really 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.400
 Interesting 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.900
 the agreements image of seven this year 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.900
 ethereal sound and almost a bit like saying 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.900
 evanescent 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.470
 they are really very soft compared to 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.990
 example to the seventh agreements of 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:45.480
 dominant with the classic do 7 that 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:48.010
 instead it has a more angular cuffaro ok 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.799
 the major seven agreement 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.209
 I 'm not a soft and ethereal ok so 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.850
 first agreement he can learn his own 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.150
 this 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:59.370
 and can often be played right away 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.290
 after an agreement instead in normal form 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.920
 in the form of a triad then for example 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.920
 I do this 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:19.520
 ok let's also make another deal ago 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.040
 majors and very often I would have found 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.980
 maybe written does set more using 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.959
 this kind of dictatorship here 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.519
 so as if it were a do with which two 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.620
 fingers are brought down more than one 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:32.959
 rope 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.790
 playing on the four highest strings 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.340
 then starting from the rope re e 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.280
 i get this fa major serves that 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.720
 definitely not interesting arrangement but 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.299
 let's see it with a more dictatorship 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.780
 more complete and we will play it 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.780
 so 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.500
 starting from the idea of ​​a major fa with 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.720
 a bar 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.330
 I'm going to remove the index to position it 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.930
 only on the rope do they leave me at mi 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.980
 sing empty 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.470
 the important thing is that the sing me vote yes 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.100
 feels because it is our seventh 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.100
 greater 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:11.790
 so here too an exercise could 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.790
 to be ago 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.130
 let me need you 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.400
 having the foresight clearly when 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:23.139
 I remove the bar from not playing mine anymore 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.080
 serious so I'm going to play from then on 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:29.139
 only on five strings another exercise 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:32.880
 may be alternating women giuseppe and fa 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:32.880
 major service feel that beautiful sound 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:54.700
 we see other important positions of me 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.830
 jose for starting from a major 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.080
 if I go to lower a semitone 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.930
 to the note that is on the soul rope ie 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:06.100
 when i don't get under it i get 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:07.690
 this is the B flat or rather the sharp sharp ok 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.970
 this is our note that we should 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.890
 introduce in to turn it into 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.780
 medium serves therefore a right penis blades 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.700
 this 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:19.960
 on five strings with the price then 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:22.660
 avoid as in all the mig rave and o 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.910
 this is the mediaset if you know the 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.040
 position saying seventh is as if it were 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:30.280
 a seventh king carried up a rope 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:33.160
 I speak at the level of fingering is ok of 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:36.990
 this is our major seven in a 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.990
 exercise could be playing the 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.970
 the major serves 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:48.110
 there 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:50.630
 the major server 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:53.480
 ok other interesting location for 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:56.150
 having a king major seven I'm going to do a 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:58.670
 mini bars with the index on the three cantini 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:02.780
 then I will have the king empty the rope a 

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:05.030
 empty plus 3 crossed bars that index 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.220
 this is our remigio seven why 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.540
 we took the tonic that rare 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.090
 we have also lowered here more a 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.560
 semitone then see that the rule that 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.870
 we saw at the beginning for which the 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:18.230
 major seventh was known to be a 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:21.370
 semitone below the tonic works 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.370
 also here therefore re 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.860
 rimini to select 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.720
 oar 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:34.150
 remigio server 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.770
 feel here as well this ethereal sound 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:37.720
 it looks ok 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:40.960
 one last exercise you can do is 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:43.300
 play the major together in sequence 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:46.650
 seven and always very nice remedy too 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.650
 I know this sound 

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:12.940
 well I hope I gave you an idea now 

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:15.970
 clearer than what these are 

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:18.760
 agreements as they are used and above all 

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:20.700
 which kind of sound then gives in 

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:23.790
 global in your musical baggage 

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:26.770
 used to accompany the songs you 

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:28.990
 you will surely come back in the future 

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:31.800
 in the near future on the topic of 

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:34.180
 agreements because it is always a universe 

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:36.780
 interesting to the next lesson 

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:36.780
 Hello and see you soon
