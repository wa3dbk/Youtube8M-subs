yes<00:02:04.690> plug<00:02:05.690> wires<00:02:05.990> are<00:02:06.320> in<00:02:06.610> ranked<00:02:07.610> collide<00:02:08.030> so

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
yes plug wires are in ranked collide so

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.380 
yes plug wires are in ranked collide so
they<00:02:08.450> call<00:02:08.660> the<00:02:08.810> cool<00:02:09.020> book<00:02:09.320> and<00:02:09.619> also<00:02:10.390> what

they call the cool book and also what
happens<00:02:11.810> is<00:02:12.080> the<00:02:12.880> Salonga<00:02:13.880> numbers<00:02:14.300> are

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
happens is the Salonga numbers are

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.600 
happens is the Salonga numbers are

not telling us about well the problem is

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.710 
not telling us about well the problem is
these<00:02:49.050> are<00:02:49.260> called<00:02:49.500> smart<00:02:49.950> for<00:02:50.540> so<00:02:51.540> what

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
these are called smart for so what

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.290 
these are called smart for so what
happens<00:02:52.110> is<00:02:52.290> if<00:02:52.470> you<00:02:52.590> put<00:02:52.830> ignition<00:02:53.340> box<00:02:53.610> the

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
happens is if you put ignition box the

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.900 
happens is if you put ignition box the
computer<00:02:54.810> will<00:02:54.959> shut<00:02:54.989> it<00:02:55.260> off<00:02:55.410> so<00:02:55.910> what

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
computer will shut it off so what

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.580 
computer will shut it off so what
happens<00:02:57.360> is<00:02:57.569> these<00:02:57.989> are<00:02:58.200> all<00:02:58.319> kind<00:02:58.530> of

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
happens is these are all kind of

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.220 
happens is these are all kind of
thinking<00:02:58.980> chip<00:02:59.280> that<00:02:59.880> you<00:03:00.060> can't<00:03:00.420> get<00:03:00.989> it<00:03:01.110> to

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
thinking chip that you can't get it to

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.140 
thinking chip that you can't get it to
go<00:03:01.260> up<00:03:01.680> it<00:03:01.860> could<00:03:01.980> fire<00:03:02.220> fast<00:03:02.640> here<00:03:02.940> by<00:03:03.090> the

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
go up it could fire fast here by the

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.420 
go up it could fire fast here by the
computer<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:03.989> shut<00:03:04.200> it<00:03:04.319> down<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.530> back<00:03:04.799> at<00:03:05.040> all

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
computer to shut it down the back at all

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.820 
computer to shut it down the back at all
so<00:03:05.910> it's<00:03:06.060> problem<00:03:06.690> by<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:06.959> computer<00:03:07.590> more

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
so it's problem by the computer more

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.950 
so it's problem by the computer more
than<00:03:07.980> a<00:03:08.100> rev<00:03:08.459> limiter<00:03:09.000> on<00:03:09.380> ignition

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:13.960 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.380 

mostly<00:03:14.230> smart<00:03:14.620> capability<00:03:15.340> he<00:03:15.700> does<00:03:15.910> it<00:03:16.210> does

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
mostly smart capability he does it does

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.840 
mostly smart capability he does it does
these<00:03:16.720> are<00:03:16.960> been<00:03:17.470> tested<00:03:18.070> not<00:03:18.250> only<00:03:18.310> for

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
these are been tested not only for

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.930 
these are been tested not only for
output<00:03:19.690> millijoules<00:03:20.530> output<00:03:21.160> but<00:03:21.790> also

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
output millijoules output but also

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.080 
output millijoules output but also
they've<00:03:22.180> been<00:03:22.210> tested<00:03:22.840> for<00:03:22.870> 400<00:03:23.650> hours<00:03:23.740> of

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
they've been tested for 400 hours of

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.270 
they've been tested for 400 hours of
duration<00:03:25.090> on<00:03:25.360> the<00:03:25.510> high<00:03:25.660> stress<00:03:26.110> so<00:03:26.980> we're

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
duration on the high stress so we're

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.240 
duration on the high stress so we're
excited<00:03:27.550> about<00:03:27.760> it<00:03:28.120> this<00:03:28.360> is

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
excited about it this is

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.250 
excited about it this is
for<00:03:29.820> itself<00:03:30.120> to<00:03:30.510> go<00:03:30.720> forward<00:03:31.140> water<00:03:32.070> food

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
for itself to go forward water food

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.240 
for itself to go forward water food
water<00:03:34.260> resistant

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
water resistant

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.280 
water resistant
you<00:03:35.490> cannot<00:03:35.820> dig<00:03:36.060> him<00:03:36.210> under<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.630> water<00:03:36.660> Bob

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
you cannot dig him under the water Bob

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.160 
you cannot dig him under the water Bob
according<00:03:38.160> to<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.430> marine<00:03:38.760> line<00:03:39.030> there<00:03:39.330> but

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
according to the marine line there but

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.480 
according to the marine line there but
they<00:03:40.380> have<00:03:40.470> other<00:03:40.590> resistant<00:03:41.220> you<00:03:41.280> could

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
they have other resistant you could

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.820 
they have other resistant you could
watch<00:03:41.700> the<00:03:41.910> engine<00:03:42.120> yes<00:03:42.660> for<00:03:43.320> you<00:03:43.410> tell<00:03:43.620> how<00:03:43.770> to

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
watch the engine yes for you tell how to

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.150 
watch the engine yes for you tell how to
submerge<00:03:44.610> it<00:03:45.170> nothing<00:03:46.170> with<00:03:46.290> electronics<00:03:47.010> is

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
submerge it nothing with electronics is
