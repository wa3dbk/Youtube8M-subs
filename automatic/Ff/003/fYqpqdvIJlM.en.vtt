workouts<00:00:54.690> as<00:00:54.809> compound<00:00:55.230> movements<00:00:55.770> which<00:00:55.860> is

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
workouts as compound movements which is

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.880 
workouts as compound movements which is
great<00:00:56.510> but<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.690> typical<00:00:57.989> workout<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.710> about

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
26 sets of workout yeah

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.910 
26 sets of workout yeah
now<00:01:02.180> the<00:01:03.180> way<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.510> works<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.170> you're<00:01:04.680> pretty

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
now the way it works is is you're pretty

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.289 
now the way it works is is you're pretty
much<00:01:05.070> taking<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.460> compound<00:01:05.909> move<00:01:06.030> let's<00:01:06.210> say

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
much taking a compound move let's say

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.270 
much taking a compound move let's say
you<00:01:06.360> working<00:01:06.750> chest<00:01:07.049> right<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.979> would<00:01:08.100> take

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
you working chest right you would take

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.940 
you working chest right you would take
let's<00:01:08.580> say<00:01:08.640> flat<00:01:09.030> barbell<00:01:09.299> bench<00:01:09.990> press<00:01:10.080> and

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
let's say flat barbell bench press and

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.070 
let's say flat barbell bench press and
you<00:01:11.100> do<00:01:11.340> 10<00:01:11.580> sets<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.030> exercise<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.689> would

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
you do 10 sets of the exercise you would

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.370 
you do 10 sets of the exercise you would
take<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.590> weight<00:01:13.890> where<00:01:14.729> if<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.080> going<00:01:16.290> to

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
take a weight where if you is going to

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.190 
take a weight where if you is going to
failure<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:17.130> could<00:01:17.310> do<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.640> 20<00:01:18.060> times<00:01:18.090> okay<00:01:18.960> so

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
failure you could do it 20 times okay so

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.950 
failure you could do it 20 times okay so
if<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.439> don't<00:01:19.710> if<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:20.130> could<00:01:20.280> do<00:01:20.400> 225<00:01:21.060> 20<00:01:21.750> reps

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
if you don't if you could do 225 20 reps

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.950 
if you don't if you could do 225 20 reps
per<00:01:22.380> set<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:23.460> will<00:01:23.610> work<00:01:23.850> out<00:01:24.060> with<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.750> way

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
per set you will work out with that way

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.660 
per set you will work out with that way
with<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.290> weight<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.890> would<00:01:26.009> try<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.310> do

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
with that weight and you would try to do

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.020 
with that weight and you would try to do
10<00:01:27.030> sets<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.570> 10<00:01:27.960> reps<00:01:28.439> with<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.579> weight<00:01:29.790> and

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
10 sets of 10 reps with that weight and

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.899 
10 sets of 10 reps with that weight and
you're<00:01:30.150> gonna<00:01:30.299> be<00:01:30.450> rest<00:01:30.659> about<00:01:30.900> 60<00:01:31.350> seconds

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
you're gonna be rest about 60 seconds

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.140 
you're gonna be rest about 60 seconds
between<00:01:32.909> each<00:01:33.180> set<00:01:33.630> Yeah<00:01:34.259> right<00:01:34.640> yeah<00:01:35.640> we

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
principles a few years about three four

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.850 
principles a few years about three four
years<00:02:06.570> ago<00:02:06.810> when<00:02:07.079> I<00:02:07.110> first<00:02:07.409> started<00:02:07.770> getting

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
years ago when I first started getting

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.940 
years ago when I first started getting
back<00:02:08.069> into<00:02:08.250> shape<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:09.110> didn't<00:02:10.110> push<00:02:10.349> ups<00:02:10.590> and

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
back into shape I didn't push ups and
