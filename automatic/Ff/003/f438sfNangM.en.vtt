00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.129
 only the models and models were introduced 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.320

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.030
 is also working to introduce them into one 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.430
 sort of mini game so have the 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.680
 ability to command these troops e 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.369

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.159
 because this official fashion model 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.720
 made from the void draft then from the same 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.330
 which makes the boyd launcher and fashionable 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.509
 official boys based on clash of 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.610
 clan that is the archer to know 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.579

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.079

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:53.090
 going to the new barbarism a madman 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:55.219
 wait for what you saw 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.399

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:00.679

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.109
 going to beat the village was here 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:06.759
 which part is very bad looked 

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:06.759
 look at him he intends to beat him 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.890
 beaten ok so he is very aggressive 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.530
 then we have our beautiful giant e 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.930
 guys I need to see the giant or my god 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.840
 oh my god it's just the guys guys 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.019
 watch the huge gobies then we have the 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.000
 goblin our beautiful goblin 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:29.390
 raider look at that what texture 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.860
 fantastic is done very well then 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.950
 we have our golem 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:37.370
 look at the goby my mom is huge 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.879
 we lose log reader or grider or leader 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.519
 that would be the beautiful little black man with 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:45.260
 the young boar also this in 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.849
 charge one of the misery we try in ari 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.450
 against a zombie to see what 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.900
 they do 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:54.640
 he's a beautiful zombie , okay me 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.959
 Zambino go on that you do nothing to him 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.389
 that you tell me nothing seems to me that the 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:02.720
 barbarian tells him something maybe is the 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:05.450
 barbarossa thinks of something and the zombies 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.370
 in practice these do not see them then 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.099
 I think the ideals must be noted again 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.310
 good settings maybe villa 0 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:15.549
 which is a kind of hatred of the given host 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.340
 they saw something 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:21.290
 let's try with village and rosell attack 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.540
 no they are all looking at something 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.160
 behind whoever is there I will throw the goblin 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.579
 overwhelmed to get on this side 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.349

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:32.060

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.609
 for now they have created hatred for those who are 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:46.140
 undermining to whom 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:48.070

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:52.120
