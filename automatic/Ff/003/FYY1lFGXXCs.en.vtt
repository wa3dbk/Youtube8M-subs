and i'll be making a bunch of content
about<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.920> once<00:00:43.920> i<00:00:44.129> once<00:00:44.579> i<00:00:44.730> get<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:45.030> in<00:00:45.210> for<00:00:45.480> you

about it once i once i get it in for you

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.340 
about it once i once i get it in for you
and<00:00:47.129> yeah<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.550> Xperia<00:00:48.030> z4<00:00:48.450> will<00:00:48.719> have<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:48.960> even

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
and yeah the Xperia z4 will have a even

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.150 
and yeah the Xperia z4 will have a even
a<00:00:49.590> better<00:00:49.860> camera<00:00:50.750> better<00:00:51.750> processor<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.739> all

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
a better camera better processor and all

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.760 
a better camera better processor and all
that<00:00:53.539> the<00:00:54.539> form<00:00:54.809> factor<00:00:54.960> will<00:00:55.320> be<00:00:55.350> probably

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
that the form factor will be probably

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.330 
that the form factor will be probably
quite<00:00:56.160> similar<00:00:56.730> if<00:00:57.690> not<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.989> same<00:00:58.109> but<00:00:58.620> Sony

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
quite similar if not the same but Sony

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.420 
quite similar if not the same but Sony
will<00:00:59.550> probably<00:00:59.940> change<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.449> few<00:01:01.190> few<00:01:02.190> things

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
will probably change a few few things

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.289 
will probably change a few few things
here<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:02.730> there<00:01:02.850> just<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.870> make<00:01:04.049> just<00:01:05.180> to<00:01:06.180> make

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
here and there just to make just to make

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.590 
here and there just to make just to make
it<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.510> bit<00:01:06.659> easier<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:07.200> use<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.409> holding<00:01:07.920> hand

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
it a bit easier to use and holding hand

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.359 
it a bit easier to use and holding hand
so<00:01:09.600> that's<00:01:09.780> pretty<00:01:09.930> much<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.140> for<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.799> expiry

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
so that's pretty much it for the expiry

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.960 
so that's pretty much it for the expiry
for<00:01:12.110> under<00:01:13.110> huge<00:01:13.790> phone<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:15.049> 2014<00:01:16.049> was<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.970> s5

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
for under huge phone of 2014 was the s5

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.910 
for under huge phone of 2014 was the s5
so<00:01:18.659> this<00:01:18.840> year<00:01:18.990> we<00:01:19.170> can<00:01:19.290> expect<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:20.330> s6<00:01:21.830> so<00:01:22.830> if

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
so this year we can expect the s6 so if

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.649 
so this year we can expect the s6 so if
you<00:01:23.040> guys<00:01:23.159> are<00:01:23.340> familiar<00:01:23.549> with<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:24.119> Samsung

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
you guys are familiar with the Samsung

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.320 
you guys are familiar with the Samsung
Galaxy<00:01:24.689> alpha<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:26.310> phone<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:26.820> built<00:01:27.119> like<00:01:27.180> a

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
Galaxy alpha that phone is built like a

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.719 
Galaxy alpha that phone is built like a
tank<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.960> that's<00:01:28.200> probably<00:01:28.500> what<00:01:28.950> Samsung<00:01:29.579> is

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
tank and that's probably what Samsung is

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.569 
tank and that's probably what Samsung is
going<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.090> do<00:01:30.270> with<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.110> Samsung<00:01:31.380> Galaxy<00:01:31.619> s6

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
going to do with the Samsung Galaxy s6

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.690 
going to do with the Samsung Galaxy s6
which<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:33.680> which<00:01:34.680> has<00:01:34.890> been<00:01:35.130> Samsung's

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
which is which has been Samsung's

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.660 
which is which has been Samsung's
problem<00:01:36.180> for<00:01:36.360> quite<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.600> while<00:01:36.869> now<00:01:37.159> a<00:01:38.159> bunch<00:01:38.579> of

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
problem for quite a while now a bunch of

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.539 
problem for quite a while now a bunch of
people<00:01:38.729> are<00:01:39.180> complaining<00:01:39.869> including<00:01:40.590> me<00:01:40.770> the

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
people are complaining including me the

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.780 
people are complaining including me the
the<00:01:42.060> build<00:01:43.049> quality<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:43.740> Samsung<00:01:44.220> phones<00:01:44.549> is

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
the build quality of Samsung phones is

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.230 
the build quality of Samsung phones is
pretty<00:01:45.890> they<00:01:46.890> break<00:01:47.189> quite<00:01:47.460> easily<00:01:47.729> I

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
pretty they break quite easily I

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.480 
pretty they break quite easily I
mean<00:01:48.869> if<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.290> drop<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.530> for<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.829> little<00:01:50.220> break

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
mean if you drop it for a little break

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.030 
mean if you drop it for a little break
right<00:01:51.860> or<00:01:52.860> fast<00:01:53.159> which<00:01:53.610> is<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:54.090> big<00:01:54.240> downfall

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
right or fast which is a big downfall

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.870 
right or fast which is a big downfall
and<00:01:56.040> that's<00:01:56.909> why<00:01:57.090> I'm<00:01:57.560> expecting<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.880> Essex

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
and that's why I'm expecting the Essex

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.289 
and that's why I'm expecting the Essex
to<00:02:00.090> be<00:02:00.240> much<00:02:00.689> more<00:02:00.719> like<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:02.270> Samsung<00:02:03.270> Galaxy

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
to be much more like the Samsung Galaxy

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.719 
to be much more like the Samsung Galaxy
alpha<00:02:03.780> which<00:02:04.290> was<00:02:04.469> built<00:02:04.710> using<00:02:05.180> the<00:02:06.180> aluminum

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
alpha which was built using the aluminum

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.540 
alpha which was built using the aluminum
so<00:02:08.729> other<00:02:09.569> than<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.590> Essex<00:02:11.160> will<00:02:11.340> also

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
so other than that the Essex will also

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.520 
so other than that the Essex will also
have<00:02:11.730> better<00:02:11.970> camera<00:02:12.480> better<00:02:12.810> specs

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
have better camera better specs

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.370 
have better camera better specs
it<00:02:14.040> will<00:02:14.220> come<00:02:14.430> with<00:02:14.670> Android<00:02:15.180> L<00:02:15.390> andrew<00:02:16.200> dahl

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
it will come with Android L andrew dahl

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.190 
it will come with Android L andrew dahl
lollipop<00:02:17.130> and<00:02:17.569> overall<00:02:18.569> it<00:02:18.720> will<00:02:18.810> be<00:02:18.959> a<00:02:18.990> much

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
lollipop and overall it will be a much

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.160 
lollipop and overall it will be a much
better<00:02:19.230> phone<00:02:20.300> then<00:02:21.300> we<00:02:21.540> also<00:02:21.690> have<00:02:22.050> the

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
better phone then we also have the

years<00:04:38.070> now<00:04:39.169> so<00:04:40.169> Apple<00:04:40.919> can't<00:04:41.130> say<00:04:41.340> that

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
years now so Apple can't say that

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.469 
years now so Apple can't say that
they're<00:04:41.669> copying<00:04:42.120> it<00:04:42.900> and<00:04:44.330> yeah<00:04:45.330> that's

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
they're copying it and yeah that's

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:48.939 
they're copying it and yeah that's
pretty<00:04:45.600> much<00:04:45.930> it<00:04:46.139> better<00:04:46.560> camera<00:04:47.070> of<00:04:47.190> course<00:04:47.449> a

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:48.949 
pretty much it better camera of course a

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:53.330 
pretty much it better camera of course a
lollipop<00:04:50.210> and<00:04:51.210> i'm<00:04:51.630> pretty<00:04:52.410> sure<00:04:52.680> that<00:04:52.710> HTC<00:04:53.280> is

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
lollipop and i'm pretty sure that HTC is

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.590 
lollipop and i'm pretty sure that HTC is
also<00:04:54.050> working<00:04:55.050> on<00:04:55.320> this<00:04:55.500> and<00:04:55.740> six<00:04:56.449> which<00:04:57.449> is

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
also working on this and six which is

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.060 
also working on this and six which is
new<00:04:57.780> version<00:04:58.229> of<00:04:58.380> sense<00:04:58.800> for<00:04:58.949> the<00:04:59.220> HTC<00:04:59.720> One<00:05:00.720> m9

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
new version of sense for the HTC One m9

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:06.230 
new version of sense for the HTC One m9
you<00:05:02.070> also<00:05:02.220> can't<00:05:02.610> forget<00:05:02.970> the<00:05:03.240> LG<00:05:03.870> g4<00:05:05.240> which

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
you also can't forget the LG g4 which

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.969 
you also can't forget the LG g4 which
will<00:05:06.449> have<00:05:06.690> hopefully<00:05:07.020> a<00:05:07.289> better<00:05:07.590> battery

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
will have hopefully a better battery

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:10.520 
will have hopefully a better battery
because<00:05:08.430> the<00:05:09.300> juice<00:05:09.539> we<00:05:09.720> had<00:05:09.960> some<00:05:10.169> battery

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
because the juice we had some battery

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.400 
because the juice we had some battery
issues<00:05:11.120> but<00:05:12.120> it<00:05:12.150> was<00:05:12.360> still<00:05:12.570> an<00:05:12.660> amazing<00:05:12.900> phone

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:13.410 
issues but it was still an amazing phone

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.189 
issues but it was still an amazing phone
