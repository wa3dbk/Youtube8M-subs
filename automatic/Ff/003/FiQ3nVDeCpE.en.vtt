00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
quarter hour some clocks start off with

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.090 
quarter hour some clocks start off with
a<00:03:24.600> quarter<00:03:25.600> hour<00:03:25.750> right<00:03:26.470> on<00:03:26.650> the<00:03:26.769> quarter<00:03:27.069> hour

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
that goes so just go D c g and then

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.539 
that goes so just go D c g and then
usually<00:03:35.230> when<00:03:35.620> they<00:03:35.709> get<00:03:35.859> to<00:03:35.980> the<00:03:36.069> half<00:03:36.280> hour

sometimes<00:03:59.200> they<00:03:59.500> leave<00:03:59.709> it<00:03:59.829> that<00:03:59.859> way<00:03:59.980> all<00:04:00.220> the

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
sometimes they leave it that way all the

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.569 
sometimes they leave it that way all the
way<00:04:00.370> through<00:04:00.459> but<00:04:01.299> the<00:04:01.569> most<00:04:01.959> the<00:04:02.889> the<00:04:03.430> one

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
way through but the most the the one

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:33.200 
way through but the most the the one
that<00:04:03.730> i<00:04:03.760> heard<00:04:04.030> most<00:04:04.329> often<00:04:04.630> is

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.970 

now<00:04:34.210> that<00:04:34.360> time<00:04:34.600> I<00:04:34.630> intentionally<00:04:35.140> played<00:04:35.770> it

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
now that time I intentionally played it

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.090 
now that time I intentionally played it
instead<00:04:36.370> of<00:04:36.490> a<00:04:36.580> see<00:04:36.820> down<00:04:37.060> here<00:04:37.420> I<00:04:37.950> played<00:04:38.950> it

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
instead of a see down here I played it

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.260 
instead of a see down here I played it
with<00:04:39.190> the<00:04:39.280> G<00:04:39.490> so<00:04:39.730> you<00:04:39.820> could<00:04:40.000> hear<00:04:40.120> the

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
with the G so you could hear the

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.800 
with the G so you could hear the
difference<00:04:40.380> here's<00:04:41.380> a<00:04:41.470> G<00:04:41.860> with<00:04:42.520> the<00:04:42.760> G<00:04:43.420> and<00:04:43.600> D

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
difference here's a G with the G and D

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:49.080 
difference here's a G with the G and D
for<00:04:44.050> the<00:04:44.140> chimes<00:04:44.410> now<00:04:44.830> here's<00:04:45.070> the<00:04:45.220> C<00:04:47.910> so<00:04:48.910> both

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
for the chimes now here's the C so both

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.150 
for the chimes now here's the C so both
of<00:04:49.300> them<00:04:49.420> work<00:04:49.600> and<00:04:49.930> you<00:04:50.650> can<00:04:50.830> you<00:04:51.100> can

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
of them work and you can you can

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.250 
of them work and you can you can
experiment<00:04:51.610> with<00:04:51.820> that<00:04:51.930> Westminster<00:04:52.930> chimes

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260
