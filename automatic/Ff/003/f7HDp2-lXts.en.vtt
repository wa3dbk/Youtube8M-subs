00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.819
 hello everyone would like a little more 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.099
 say about the camera I'm four thousand and 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:10.290
 one of her problems 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:12.630
 It means many say that native charging 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.590
 which gives me to collect about here 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.350
 it should look like 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.170
 that is, this one here spoils 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:23.250
 batteries or charging ie camera 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.500
 not charging is not such a situation 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:30.720
 happened now show java hours so 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.340
 floor red light flashes only 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.820
 slightly and then just the camera 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.690
 turns on and everything I thought my 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.520
 situations exactly what happened and 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:45.440
 charging ditched 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.440
 battery but in fact it is not 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.950
 I will try to show the reasons 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.950
 if it is visible on camera 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:08.330
 already let's take focus i think it is clear that 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:10.830
 one of the connectors just breaks and 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.850
 I assume that the cause of broken 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:18.260
 charge it in this one 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:21.300
 just a very flimsy construction from these 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:27.510
 contacts not like focus ok take 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:29.610
 can't try to make out this 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:34.250
 battery and see what's really 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:43.710
 In fact, he has data written here 900 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:47.660
 milliampere hour most likely for the smaller I 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.660
 I'll sort it out and try to figure it out. 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:02.330
 you can't wash it as you see here right away 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.270
 lights up and all the fine works 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:08.540
 what if someone has a red light not 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.290
 lights up when charging believe these 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.390
 here are the contacts 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:14.680
 most likely the exact same one of them and 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.680
 bent or jumped off 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:42.610
 in general, as always, the Chinese are being deceived 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:46.509
 batteries that's what 700 how 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:55.060
 see what is written outside 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:57.159
 900 batteries apparently 200 of these 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.610
 milliamps brings them huge profits 

00:04:57.159 --> 00:05:04.659
 since they are trying in this way maturity 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:08.340
 buyers here's the problem here 

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:11.159
 was with this battery zadenitsya 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:14.919
 this one 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:17.199
 Contact at my extremely someone 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:18.699
 maybe I'll try another 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:21.389
 kick him back for everything to come back 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:21.389
 as was 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.440
 him to him 

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:55.310
 considering such a problem, I would advise 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.560
 paris rearrange batteries in 

00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:00.800
 the camera so as not to break 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:06.139
 here are these legs contacts 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:08.240
 it is charging better now 

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:11.750
 either in the camera itself or 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:13.759
 I don't even know how else from charging from 

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:16.449
 computer but paris rearrange because 

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:16.449
 that break him
