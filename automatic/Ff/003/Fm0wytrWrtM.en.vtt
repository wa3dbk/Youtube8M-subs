00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.010
 with it takes away the greetings and I give the 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.430
 Welcome inside the cabin 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.619
 bulldozer cat of 11 76 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.570
 we go from colleagues journeys in two 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:30.419
 stages the first one is going to be referring to 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.400
 dashboard or fret 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:34.320
 instrument where we do in 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.390
 analogous way we have different 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.450
 equipment parameters for example 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.210
 we have the rpm or the revolutions of 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.030
 motor oil temperature 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.600
 hydraulic coolant temperature 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.670
 fuel level temperature of the 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.570
 transmission oil after us 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.780
 we have symbology for example renew 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.449
 which is active at this time and what 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.000
 had the style of the cylinders of 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.070
 tilt the top sheet now 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.380
 then not only here in digital form 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.740
 we also see that we have activated the 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.380
 parking brake the speed of both 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.950
 advance as backward the other meter 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.810
 of the team 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.120
 then and you can appreciate 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.290
 different symbols here where to measure 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.850
 that we are occupying the 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.760
 different functions the team is 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.340
 showing on the screen for example a 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.910
 simple function that when I get up 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.160
 of the operator sector and I have no excuse my 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.840
 Seat belt is going to 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.780
 ignite by the symbolism do in the 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.930
 board 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:42.440
 then at sea in my left arm 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:46.790
 I have the management system of 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:49.400
 equipment that is the ftse-100 ft 6 wants 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.170
 say feng starts control which is control 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.320
 high that where we are from 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.060
 directed the team or controlled it 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.180
 team management 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.899
 we have here two controls that 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.940
 are the controls of caterpillars or viral 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:08.060
 where we for example have 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:10.970
 small route that is firstly the 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:14.720
 steering clutch already pressing to 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.820
 background we are going to slow down the caterpillar 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.830
 left in this case to the final command of 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.900
 the left euro and we are going to produce the 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.209
 turn to the left accordingly 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.500
 the right control not only we 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.470
 we find the route of the 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.410
 direction clutch and already brake the bottom 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:34.370
 we press steering 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:38.629
 let's get the right turn 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.010
 this control is the one of neutral advance and 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:43.099
 recoil us when we press 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.629
 The team is going to advance in this 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.319
 moment is the neutral and if we press 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:50.299
 backwards the team will go back 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:53.030
 we also have a keypad that is 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.560
 keypad are from the ascending and 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.959
 descending the team we had 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.090
 first second and third speed and 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.310
 third third and first when 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.800
 we occupy the system of 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.720
 address 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.910
 on the screen it will also show 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.190
 that we for example are in 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.110
 first speed but the neutral when 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.930
 we are going to advance is going to show 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.670
 the first speed with an f if 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.650
 we want to go back also 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.570
 will show the first speed with 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.160
 an independent r of the speed is 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.590
 that you want to apply is going 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.260
 showing here on the screen in form 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.150
 digital 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.560
 we also find that this 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.470
 limp 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:37.019
 but economically friendly because it 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:40.079
 can go down and advance or delay 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:42.450
 depending on the ergonomics of the operator 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:45.000
 be it the operator feels 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.519
 comfortable in a position where you can 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.340
 accommodate your hip can work without 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:52.220
 no problem make the team not only 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:55.439
 we also find a symbology 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:58.769
 associated with for example the first is that 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:04:00.510
 you are always alerting your position or 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:03.389
 if you are going to enter a blasting zone 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.980
 so it will not be when 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:09.269
 danger from a blast or blast 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.639
 colleagues always have to check their 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:13.170
 position and find out where the 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:16.109
 disturbing so that it is not 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.000
 affected after we have this symbology 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.859
 that corresponds to someone you always 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.320
 must read and understand the manuals of 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.150
 operation or associated procedures 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.780
 to the machine or procedures 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.780
 associates 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.840
 we have this symbology that means 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.820
 that you faced or possible hanging 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.330
 he always has to be with his belt 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:38.569
 security post 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.939
 On the other hand we find here 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:44.509
 the right pedal that corresponds to the 

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:48.710
 Accelerator of the equipment and the pedal 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:53.570
 left that is the service brake 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:56.740
 not just the right hand to find 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:05:01.520
 with our adviser system screen 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:04.190
 this panel is the indicators of the car 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:07.160
 carrying the dozer blade and our 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:10.490
 controls or our buttons the 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:13.370
 Front side work lights and 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:16.820
 back us 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:19.060
 to turn on or off the work lights 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:21.940
 this panel 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.230
 of the auto carrion sheet finds them 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:27.110
 running in the subway since this 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:30.170
 function was associated to the country in 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:34.190
 we will describe in the second 

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:36.980
 stage what is the record and be the steak and 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:38.990
 NATO was associated with other functions 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.500
 who has the equipment and the control of 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:43.820
 river 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.820
 or the torn
