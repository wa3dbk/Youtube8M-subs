00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
this probably is going to be like the

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.300 
this probably is going to be like the
shortest<00:03:17.790> part<00:03:18.120> in<00:03:18.239> this<00:03:18.330> entire<00:03:18.660> chapter

shortest part in this entire chapter
this<00:03:20.310> chapter<00:03:20.549> actually<00:03:20.910> my<00:03:21.420> memory<00:03:21.690> serves

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019

this chapter actually my memory serves
me<00:03:22.260> correctly<00:03:22.860> is<00:03:23.299> will<00:03:24.299> take<00:03:24.600> me<00:03:24.810> a<00:03:24.840> long<00:03:25.110> time

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
me correctly is will take me a long time

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.130 
me correctly is will take me a long time
and<00:03:26.220> then<00:03:26.400> I<00:03:26.580> said<00:03:26.820> in<00:03:26.910> the<00:03:26.940> last<00:03:27.150> episodes<00:03:28.019> in
