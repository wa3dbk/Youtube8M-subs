basics of grain then I'll teach you how
to<00:00:20.550> cut<00:00:20.850> out<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.000> pattern<00:00:21.390> piece<00:00:21.600> on<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:21.990> bias

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
to cut out a pattern piece on the bias

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.140 
to cut out a pattern piece on the bias
and<00:00:23.070> then<00:00:23.310> I'll<00:00:23.519> show<00:00:23.670> you<00:00:23.699> some<00:00:23.970> cool

lengthwise on the fabric there's very
little<00:00:35.190> stretch<00:00:35.610> because<00:00:36.540> it's<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.230> main

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
little stretch because it's the main

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.450 
little stretch because it's the main

the fabric there's slight stretch

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.900 
the fabric there's slight stretch
because<00:00:46.289> they're<00:00:46.590> woven<00:00:46.739> over<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.489> under<00:00:47.760> the

from being cut on the bias because

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.520 
from being cut on the bias because
they're<00:01:41.159> too<00:01:41.340> stiff<00:01:41.700> as<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.840> can<00:01:43.020> see<00:01:43.259> even

next I'm going to teach you how to cut
out<00:02:06.370> a<00:02:06.400> pattern<00:02:06.700> piece<00:02:07.000> on<00:02:07.180> the<00:02:07.330> bias<00:02:08.940> I'm

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
out a pattern piece on the bias I'm

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.060 
out a pattern piece on the bias I'm
going<00:02:10.300> to<00:02:10.390> be<00:02:10.479> using<00:02:10.660> a<00:02:10.930> simple<00:02:11.350> top<00:02:11.620> pattern

just<00:02:25.300> remember<00:02:25.720> that<00:02:25.870> when<00:02:26.050> you're

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
just remember that when you're

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.140 
just remember that when you're
purchasing<00:02:26.710> fabric<00:02:27.220> to<00:02:27.460> purchase<00:02:27.790> a<00:02:27.940> little

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
purchasing fabric to purchase a little

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.300 
purchasing fabric to purchase a little
bit<00:02:28.300> more<00:02:28.750> because<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:29.560> pattern<00:02:29.860> pieces<00:02:30.160> will

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
bit more because the pattern pieces will

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.420 
bit more because the pattern pieces will
be<00:02:30.340> cut<00:02:30.610> out<00:02:30.730> at<00:02:30.910> an<00:02:31.030> angle<00:02:34.350> to<00:02:35.350> find<00:02:35.770> the<00:02:36.160> bias

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.950 
be cut out at an angle to find the bias
line<00:02:37.830> you'll<00:02:38.830> simply<00:02:39.310> draw<00:02:40.210> a<00:02:40.450> line<00:02:40.720> that's

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
line you'll simply draw a line that's

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.160 
line you'll simply draw a line that's
perpendicular<00:02:41.290> to<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.460> grain<00:02:42.670> line<00:02:43.170> the

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
perpendicular to the grain line the

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:53.780 
perpendicular to the grain line the
grain<00:02:44.380> line<00:02:44.560> will<00:02:44.740> be<00:02:44.860> on<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.130> pattern<00:02:52.050> then

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
grain line will be on the pattern then

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.520 
grain line will be on the pattern then
they'll<00:02:54.790> fold<00:02:55.330> the<00:02:55.540> tissue<00:02:55.810> over<00:02:56.880> so<00:02:57.880> that

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
they'll fold the tissue over so that

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.490 
they'll fold the tissue over so that
your<00:02:59.530> line<00:02:59.890> and<00:03:00.160> the<00:03:00.670> grain<00:03:00.910> line<00:03:01.500> intersect

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
your line and the grain line intersect

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.730 
your line and the grain line intersect
with<00:03:02.710> the<00:03:02.860> wood<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:03.490> lines<00:03:04.560> underneath<00:03:05.560> the

with the wood the lines underneath the

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:11.070 
with the wood the lines underneath the
tissue<00:03:09.150> then<00:03:10.150> you'll<00:03:10.300> do<00:03:10.450> the<00:03:10.570> same<00:03:10.810> on<00:03:10.959> the

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
you see now these lines that you just

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:39.479 
you see now these lines that you just
folded<00:03:31.420> are<00:03:31.989> your<00:03:32.530> bias<00:03:32.800> lines<00:03:38.190> if<00:03:39.190> you<00:03:39.280> want

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
align it with the grain line and the

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.280 
align it with the grain line and the

sometimes<00:04:54.520> you<00:04:55.060> might<00:04:55.210> find<00:04:55.510> that<00:04:55.810> adding<00:04:56.139> a

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
seat a center seam is beneficial because

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
seat a center seam is beneficial because
it<00:04:59.710> will<00:04:59.860> help<00:05:00.070> balance<00:05:00.310> out<00:05:00.760> both<00:05:01.270> sides<00:05:01.599> as

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
it will help balance out both sides as

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.550 
it will help balance out both sides as
you<00:05:03.460> can<00:05:03.639> see<00:05:03.880> this<00:05:04.780> side<00:05:04.990> was<00:05:05.169> cut<00:05:05.320> on<00:05:05.349> the

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
you can see this side was cut on the

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.350 
you can see this side was cut on the
bias<00:05:05.710> and<00:05:06.070> so<00:05:06.460> was<00:05:06.639> this<00:05:06.880> and<00:05:07.180> they<00:05:07.300> were

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
bias and so was this and they were

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.330 
bias and so was this and they were
joined<00:05:07.720> by<00:05:07.810> a<00:05:07.930> center<00:05:08.320> seam<00:05:08.560> which<00:05:08.889> gives<00:05:09.130> it<00:05:09.250> a
