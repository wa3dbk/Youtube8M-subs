 education is not quite a few seconds 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.820
 if the program is not on its own 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.430

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.860
 user support and movies ejected 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.890

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.420

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:27.239
 the construction of the facility in his 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.519
 folder or if a particular keyword 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:32.430
 with is in next we have 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:35.069
 By j it will be local to you for everything 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.549
 created and that really pays off 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:41.970
 for example, to the ttc lok carbon copy 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:44.269
 cloner lures that is from aspen yet 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.549
 eight weeks old or what do I know what 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:49.260
 perels log me already handy 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:53.130
 still all logfiles over there somebody 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.140
 throwing out close-ups would mean 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.959
 the procedure place was formally however 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.269
 all windows and tabs are closed 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.280
 so if I have the offer what everything 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:05.819
 I would like to click on clean 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.519
 and now he's doing it all for me 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.680
 what I have clicked on the usa must 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.799
 one can still see a title of the case 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.650
 This is done by loks Mr. Winkler 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:18.690
 is done, too, I'll take a look 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.709
 just get everything promoted 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.090
 can adjust 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:26.400
 on the one hand, security july celebrates this 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.970
 means details and safely deleted 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.530
 become 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.900
 So not only delete once but 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.530
 really should be overwritten several times 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.709
 become 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.590
 this memory area does not do that 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.000
 to find more that lara are arguing 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.819
 the learned about it really does 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.880
 you have to know yourself 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:48.329
 many great race and a spread so 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.760
 self- created rules for items all 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:51.870
 That's what I did to myself 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.540
 I set yes 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.970
 I can search for updates here and 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.100
 hereafter the agence means when I roll 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:03.210
 has installed me culinary 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:06.390
 give or that should black metal if that 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:08.820
 was successfully done or that 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.470
 dudok own cleaning which always jumps 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.990
 up and down during the roof work 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.910
 that's not what you know with black 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.520
 can make hole is a meaningful 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.290
 application to say I want 

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:22.140
 just a little bit my tracks 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.400
 embarrassed because that is easy if 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.050
 he 'll see it then 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.640
 then not what I go on from there or 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.470
 I sometimes have to go to the computer myself 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:32.250
 have no second user set up there 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:34.830
 At least I can do a lot here 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.910
 really short and painless 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.430
 clean up quickly 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.860
 that 's it to black hole I find one 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.270
 great tool you can try if 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.830
 to stimulate it sensibly hurts too 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.510
