00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.900
 so this is him 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.810
 yes this is my ergo crux when enter the 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.189
 professional stands stool and he is from 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.210
 me I once again new so I find 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.610
 very exciting 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.430
 Start running for six hours and well 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.480
 as you can see the six hours are that 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.390
 becomes another difficult story that is 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.739
 recently operated passes 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.809
 and the collected so then I go in the 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.340
 loyal stand in and then it goes one 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.690
 bit will work is a kind of third leg 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.790
 say it 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.620
 and i can just as well so that 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.950
 doing things in it seems like i am 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.840
 stand and now six hours set that is natural 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.570
 after such an experience it is a decent one 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.520
 what do you hear for why buses that 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.790
 six hour set and not not an hour or 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.770
 two 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.440

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.670

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.700

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.130
 do what I did and my six hours 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.940
 sets that will enjoy drinking 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.980
 faithful and yes it seemed nice 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.900
 would come back during the period 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.520
 that you were absent or in the hospital 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.260
 of course you could not 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.050
 practice or do you secretly still here and 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.430
 just press the button there for yes 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.380
 that's why you were saying it 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.140
 mainly engaged in myself and 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.060
 friends and family around it and had 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.340
