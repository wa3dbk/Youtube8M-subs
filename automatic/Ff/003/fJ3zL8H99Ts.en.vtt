00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.210
 but 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.650
 we started as always with the proof of 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.650
 shadow 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.560
 Now let's apply this color jumbo 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.960
 champagne from the outside by the eyelid 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.970
 mobile like shadows in cream and 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.840
 over we are going to apply this beige shadow 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.840
 of the palette 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.309
 and for the basin we're going to put this 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.309
 Toasty shadow of the same palette 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:56.200
 and with a shadow of mate we are going to 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.150
 illuminate the arch of the eyebrow with a 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.260
 shadow a little darker we finished off 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.260
 darken the basin 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.720
 Now let's apply as always the 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.190
 base of makeup you see that it is 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.100
 applying the base h that I am 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.780
 Wishing to finish it if you know if 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.330
 you want to know my opinion on that basis 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.700
 or I'll leave a video here so that 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:22.180
 you see 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.770
 the concealer the powder the contour 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.100
 highlighter colors and all 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.100
 videos 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.990
 now let's do the delineation 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.090
 top of the black with made eyeliner 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.980
 from the rihanna collection though 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.360
 this one you have the fixed linear also in 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.360
 cow and the normal black 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.890
 with an intense blue pencil we make up the 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.890
 line of the lower lashes 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.800
 and we apply the mascara 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.930
 and in this case I'm going to apply lipstick 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:40.310
 games and others the most clear so that 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.310
 have more attention the eyes 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.530
 and you have finished it, I hope that 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.810
 have you liked hand up if so 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.620
 a little kiss and see you in the next 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.620
