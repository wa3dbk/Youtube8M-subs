00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.990
 it's a second exercise with a landscape 

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.890
 for this landscape was carried out in pose a big problem with a filter 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.710
 a declation finds the filter which makes lose nine openings so as to 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.099
 be able to do long poses days and this movie deals with 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:16.689
 annoying trends more 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:17.849
 he believed 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:21.329
 dominant mpm to paste and conflict 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.090
 so same principle about this country only thing we saw in the exercise 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:26.960
 1 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.199
 so we're going 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.729
 he leaves the party 

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:34.070
 white balance 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.810
 if we look at the histogram 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.130
 like the band of gaza well we see who is completely detached 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.480
 and so we can because the problem 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.480
 m the white balance 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.030
 the following operations constituted to do exactly as did 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.700
 previously 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.120
 delay make a definition of the project 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.310
 to say I'm going to use a sample 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.920
 and from there 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.220
 we start then we will select an area so here we do not really have the 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.650
 risk areas I will work in a cloud area 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.090
 and then I will make some corrections thereafter according to the needs 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.729
 the jccm is completely 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:14.890
 like a year ago I understand the interest that is still pretty 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.470
 close to natural 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.220
 maybe even a little too red in the picture so I'm going to use 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.680
 the time the sliders for the displaced for the very slightly 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.000
 in the red 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.410
 little bit of blue in addition to his point of view same thing moved 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.790
 slightly the image to see the example that suits me well it's 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:34.680
 too much 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.560
 i can do it manually what jacques not enough precise the 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.830
 master at 80 8 300 places 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.480
 so here I have my image that realized then we see that the white balance 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.550
 and then show up just now so if I understand announce plans 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.020
 and that artificial 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.400
 or not so I see that we still have not the young man who superimposes but 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.859
 no picture of what it will serve me 

00:01:55.859 --> 00:02:00.520
 to feed a photo a little further we will see his photos in an exercise by 

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:04.739
 following particular follow but at the draw of American history 

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:06.359
 the museum exhibition
