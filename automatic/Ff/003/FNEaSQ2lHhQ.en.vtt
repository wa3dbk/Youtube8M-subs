much<00:02:03.420> white<00:02:04.020> as<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.469> can<00:02:04.619> see<00:02:04.799> because<00:02:05.009> I

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
much white as you can see because I

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.260 
much white as you can see because I
don't<00:02:05.250> use<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:06.509> used<00:02:06.990> to

don't use it I used to

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.650 
don't use it I used to
because<00:02:07.600> I<00:02:07.630> don't<00:02:07.990> really<00:02:08.200> contour<00:02:08.679> because<00:02:08.860> I

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
because I don't really contour because I

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.650 
because I don't really contour because I

and I really can't review cuz I don't
cut<00:02:16.000> her<00:02:16.150> but<00:02:16.690> yeah<00:02:17.019> my<00:02:17.920> favorite<00:02:18.190> right<00:02:18.489> now

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
cut her but yeah my favorite right now

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.559 
cut her but yeah my favorite right now
is<00:02:19.000> probably<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:20.019> two<00:02:20.590> foundation<00:02:21.220> brushes

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
is probably the two foundation brushes

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.869 
is probably the two foundation brushes
because<00:02:22.709> they're<00:02:23.709> amazing<00:02:24.310> I<00:02:24.430> use<00:02:24.640> these<00:02:24.819> for

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
because they're amazing I use these for

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.600 
because they're amazing I use these for
like<00:02:25.239> my<00:02:25.360> under<00:02:25.660> eye<00:02:25.690> just<00:02:26.530> um<00:02:26.950> concealing

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
like my under eye just um concealing

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.309 
like my under eye just um concealing
that<00:02:27.700> area<00:02:28.060> because<00:02:28.239> it<00:02:28.420> does<00:02:28.540> get<00:02:28.720> darker<00:02:29.080> and

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
that area because it does get darker and

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.009 
that area because it does get darker and
then<00:02:29.860> this<00:02:30.129> I<00:02:30.370> would<00:02:31.120> use<00:02:31.390> for<00:02:31.660> a<00:02:31.690> liquid

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
then this I would use for a liquid

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.470 
then this I would use for a liquid
foundation<00:02:32.140> or<00:02:32.799> like<00:02:33.730> powder<00:02:34.060> sometimes

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
foundation or like powder sometimes

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.630 
foundation or like powder sometimes
because<00:02:34.870> it<00:02:34.989> works<00:02:35.170> so<00:02:35.290> well<00:02:35.500> packing<00:02:36.459> on<00:02:36.549> the

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
because it works so well packing on the

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.360 
because it works so well packing on the
powder<00:02:36.849> with<00:02:37.180> that<00:02:37.360> moving<00:02:37.840> anywhere<00:02:38.410> so

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
powder with that moving anywhere so

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.280 
powder with that moving anywhere so
these<00:02:39.579> are<00:02:39.880> my<00:02:40.060> top<00:02:40.120> two<00:02:40.480> right<00:02:40.810> now<00:02:40.959> for<00:02:41.230> this

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290

the<00:02:44.709> Diaz<00:02:45.010> Taylor<00:02:45.430> brush<00:02:45.730> I<00:02:45.970> just<00:02:46.030> used<00:02:46.870> it<00:02:46.989> on

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
the Diaz Taylor brush I just used it on

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:49.550

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
worked wonders I was so so so happy that

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.280 
worked wonders I was so so so happy that
um<00:02:54.670> I<00:02:54.970> can<00:02:55.239> use<00:02:55.390> different<00:02:55.510> something<00:02:55.900> at

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
um I can use different something at

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.050 
um I can use different something at
first<00:02:56.620> I<00:02:56.799> started<00:02:56.860> using<00:02:57.220> it<00:02:57.489> under<00:02:57.730> my<00:02:57.849> eyes

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
first I started using it under my eyes

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.710 
first I started using it under my eyes
but<00:02:58.420> it<00:02:58.660> was<00:02:58.870> a<00:02:58.900> little<00:02:59.170> too<00:02:59.440> um<00:03:00.450> dense<00:03:01.450> for

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
but it was a little too um dense for

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.509 
but it was a little too um dense for
that<00:03:01.840> because<00:03:01.959> it<00:03:02.140> would<00:03:02.380> hurt<00:03:02.620> a<00:03:02.680> little<00:03:02.829> so<00:03:03.489> I

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
that because it would hurt a little so I

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.729 
that because it would hurt a little so I
started<00:03:03.880> to<00:03:04.000> use<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:04.299> foundation<00:03:04.660> brush<00:03:04.870> the

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
started to use the foundation brush the

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.520 
started to use the foundation brush the
skinny<00:03:06.069> foundation<00:03:06.579> brush<00:03:06.700> which<00:03:07.209> is<00:03:07.420> um<00:03:07.690> it

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
skinny foundation brush which is um it

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.619 
skinny foundation brush which is um it
works<00:03:08.709> out<00:03:08.829> really<00:03:08.950> good<00:03:09.160> and<00:03:09.430> then<00:03:09.970> I<00:03:10.299> just

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:10.629 
works out really good and then I just

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:12.660 
works out really good and then I just
didn't<00:03:11.019> use<00:03:11.170> this<00:03:11.350> year<00:03:11.500> because<00:03:11.680> I<00:03:11.739> want<00:03:11.920> to

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:22.389 
since of all these so you get all these

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:25.470 
since of all these so you get all these
brushes<00:03:23.250> these<00:03:24.250> and<00:03:24.549> then<00:03:24.970> you<00:03:25.000> also<00:03:25.239> get<00:03:25.450> a

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
brushes these and then you also get a

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.160 
brushes these and then you also get a
kit<00:03:25.780> with<00:03:25.959> it<00:03:26.170> so<00:03:26.769> you<00:03:26.829> can<00:03:27.239> flip<00:03:28.239> it<00:03:28.420> down<00:03:28.600> with

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
kit with it so you can flip it down with

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.390 
kit with it so you can flip it down with
the<00:03:29.319> stand<00:03:29.650> like<00:03:30.190> that<00:03:30.540> and<00:03:32.100> then<00:03:33.100> there's

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
the stand like that and then there's

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.160 
the stand like that and then there's
like<00:03:33.579> a<00:03:33.790> little<00:03:33.819> string<00:03:34.480> where<00:03:34.660> you<00:03:34.780> can<00:03:34.930> push

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.460 
like a little string where you can push
and<00:03:35.380> pull<00:03:35.920> it<00:03:36.099> or<00:03:37.090> you<00:03:37.269> can<00:03:37.450> have<00:03:38.200> it<00:03:38.319> like<00:03:38.410> this

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
and pull it or you can have it like this

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.949 
and pull it or you can have it like this
put<00:03:39.280> the<00:03:39.400> brushes<00:03:39.760> inside<00:03:39.910> close<00:03:40.420> knot<00:03:40.690> and

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
put the brushes inside close knot and

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.309 
put the brushes inside close knot and
seal<00:03:41.829> it<00:03:42.069> I<00:03:42.599> really<00:03:43.599> really<00:03:43.870> love<00:03:44.109> these

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
seal it I really really love these

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.640 
seal it I really really love these
brushes<00:03:44.590> and<00:03:45.420> there's<00:03:46.420> so<00:03:46.810> much<00:03:46.959> cheaper<00:03:47.319> than

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
brushes and there's so much cheaper than

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.250 
brushes and there's so much cheaper than
anything<00:03:48.010> else<00:03:48.310> but<00:03:48.849> they<00:03:49.000> work<00:03:49.269> exactly<00:03:49.660> the

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
anything else but they work exactly the

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.250 
anything else but they work exactly the
same<00:03:50.440> way<00:03:50.760> um<00:03:51.760> I<00:03:52.060> think<00:03:52.150> this<00:03:52.480> whole<00:03:52.810> kit<00:03:53.079> was

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
same way um I think this whole kit was

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.409 
same way um I think this whole kit was
twenty<00:03:53.680> dollars<00:03:54.069> and<00:03:54.430> I<00:03:54.849> was<00:03:54.970> a<00:03:55.030> gift<00:03:55.209> from<00:03:55.269> my
