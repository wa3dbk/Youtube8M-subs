00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
together which is about the same like

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.779 
together which is about the same like
where<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:51.989> mine<00:00:52.680> or<00:00:52.980> if<00:00:53.250> you've<00:00:53.399> done<00:00:53.579> that

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
yet you basically get three like you you

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.750 
yet you basically get three like you you
have<00:00:58.050> three<00:00:58.410> items<00:00:58.620> come<00:00:58.949> out<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.280> but<00:00:59.640> you

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
have three items come out of it but you

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.479 
have three items come out of it but you
get<00:00:59.850> times<00:01:00.180> two<00:01:00.449> with<00:01:00.629> this<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.800> when<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.370> go

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
and give it back to HOD it gives you

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.960 
and give it back to HOD it gives you
like<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:05.090> decent<00:01:06.090> sum<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.420> gold<00:01:06.659> for<00:01:07.110> every<00:01:07.590> two

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
like a decent sum of gold for every two

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.640 
like a decent sum of gold for every two
chunks<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.240> obviously<00:01:09.659> you're<00:01:09.780> getting<00:01:09.960> six

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
chunks and obviously you're getting six

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.679 
chunks and obviously you're getting six
chunks<00:01:10.979> with<00:01:11.130> each<00:01:11.250> time<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.580> use<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:12.119> once

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
chunks with each time you use it so once

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.469 
chunks with each time you use it so once
you've<00:01:12.840> done<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.020> as<00:01:13.729> you<00:01:14.729> can<00:01:14.850> see<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.270> can

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
you've done that as you can see you can

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.260 
you've done that as you can see you can
just<00:01:15.689> basically<00:01:15.750> wreak<00:01:16.310> like<00:01:17.310> redo<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.850> cycle

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
just basically wreak like redo the cycle

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.109 
just basically wreak like redo the cycle
over<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.049> over<00:01:19.200> again<00:01:19.290> until<00:01:19.590> you've<00:01:19.950> got<00:01:20.250> a

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
over and over again until you've got a

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.820 
over and over again until you've got a
ton<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.659> blocks<00:01:21.990> but<00:01:22.170> as<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:22.350> can<00:01:22.470> see<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.680> does

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
ton of blocks but as you can see it does

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.420 
ton of blocks but as you can see it does
take<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.490> long<00:01:23.850> time<00:01:24.350> so<00:01:25.350> this<00:01:25.799> isn't<00:01:26.009> like<00:01:26.159> a

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
take a long time so this isn't like a

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.399 
take a long time so this isn't like a
horrid<00:01:26.820> glitch<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.479> game<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.930> just<00:01:28.259> that

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
horrid glitch in the game is just that

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.410 
horrid glitch in the game is just that
HUD<00:01:28.650> doesn't<00:01:29.130> have<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.400> money<00:01:29.670> limit<00:01:30.060> unlike

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
HUD doesn't have a money limit unlike

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.170 
HUD doesn't have a money limit unlike
merchant<00:01:31.409> dealers<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:31.920> unlike<00:01:32.729> every<00:01:33.150> other

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
merchant dealers and unlike every other

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.420 
merchant dealers and unlike every other
character<00:01:33.600> in<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.930> game<00:01:34.079> he<00:01:34.710> just<00:01:34.890> gives<00:01:35.189> you

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
character in the game he just gives you

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.060 
character in the game he just gives you
gold<00:01:35.750> which<00:01:36.750> not<00:01:37.020> many<00:01:37.049> characters<00:01:37.560> do<00:01:37.770> they

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
gold which not many characters do they

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.950 
gold which not many characters do they
don't<00:01:38.520> really<00:01:38.729> give<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:38.909> much<00:01:39.119> else<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.540> guess

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
don't really give you much else I guess

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.080 
don't really give you much else I guess
because<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.170> can<00:01:40.380> do<00:01:40.530> this<00:01:40.680> like<00:01:40.920> early<00:01:41.280> on<00:01:41.430> he

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
because you can do this like early on he

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
200 to 300 gold so you know if you need

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:10.449 
200 to 300 gold so you know if you need
that<00:04:08.540> kind<00:04:08.870> of<00:04:09.049> amount<00:04:09.319> is<00:04:09.590> a<00:04:09.650> good<00:04:10.010> way<00:04:10.099> to<00:04:10.130> get

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
that kind of amount is a good way to get

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.360 
that kind of amount is a good way to get
it<00:04:10.609> if<00:04:10.970> you<00:04:11.870> know<00:04:12.260> it's<00:04:12.440> a<00:04:12.530> better<00:04:12.650> it's<00:04:13.280> a

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
it if you know it's a better it's a

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.539 
it if you know it's a better it's a
better<00:04:13.549> method<00:04:13.730> to<00:04:13.940> get<00:04:14.090> like<00:04:14.209> huge<00:04:14.599> sums<00:04:14.930> like

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
better method to get like huge sums like

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:18.670 
better method to get like huge sums like
2,000<00:04:16.549> or<00:04:16.700> 3,000<00:04:17.359> but<00:04:17.930> you<00:04:18.079> need<00:04:18.289> to<00:04:18.349> put<00:04:18.500> some

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
2,000 or 3,000 but you need to put some

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.009 
2,000 or 3,000 but you need to put some
serious<00:04:19.039> amount<00:04:19.459> of<00:04:19.519> time<00:04:19.700> and<00:04:19.909> to<00:04:20.000> do<00:04:20.120> and

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
serious amount of time and to do and

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.210 
serious amount of time and to do and
because<00:04:22.019> it<00:04:22.139> takes<00:04:22.320> so<00:04:22.530> long<00:04:22.680> and<00:04:22.860> sometimes

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
because it takes so long and sometimes

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.040 
because it takes so long and sometimes
you'll<00:04:23.400> find<00:04:23.580> his<00:04:23.880> wife<00:04:24.120> using<00:04:24.540> a<00:04:25.050> block<00:04:26.010> but

you'll just be able to jump straight
back<00:04:45.660> on<00:04:45.900> it<00:04:46.020> and<00:04:46.250> then<00:04:47.250> you<00:04:47.370> just<00:04:47.520> keep

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
back on it and then you just keep

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:49.610 
back on it and then you just keep
repeating<00:04:47.970> the<00:04:48.210> cycle<00:04:48.360> so<00:04:48.840> you<00:04:48.900> know<00:04:49.169> you<00:04:49.229> can

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
repeating the cycle so you know you can

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.520

raid caves if you want fast money but I
find<00:04:52.979> this<00:04:53.070> is<00:04:53.220> like<00:04:53.370> you<00:04:53.850> know<00:04:53.940> you<00:04:54.000> put<00:04:54.419> the

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
effort into it you get a load more out

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.870 
effort into it you get a load more out
and<00:04:56.850> I've<00:04:57.030> used<00:04:57.240> this<00:04:57.419> to<00:04:57.600> kind<00:04:57.780> of<00:04:57.870> fuel<00:04:58.199> my<00:04:58.880> my
