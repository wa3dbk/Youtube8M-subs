00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:09.230
 Yes Hello this time by reference to Kokasen's ellegarden arpeggio 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:13.460
 I would like to practice 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:15.610
 Let's hear a little slowly was a building with such a feeling 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.610
 Good 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.730
 Good good 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.730
 Good good 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.789
 Cormorants Uu 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.789
 Good good 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:40.730
 Yes, it was a phrase like this This is a more original song, of course, but at first it is 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:46.250
 I think it would be good to practice slowly, so I played it a little slowly 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:50.000
 Really the luck because there is very little also is it that the movement of the finger towards the just starting the guitar 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.970
 The I think that it is easy phrase I chord progression but 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.720
 a major 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:01:00.290
 I will explain last but at first roughly a pot and d 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:01.700
 2 minutes of my own English 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.239
 Good 5 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:09.700
 It sounds like 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:10.330
 I think that this side is also interesting because it is a characteristic song that the bass sound changes rapidly 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.410
 But 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:18.730
 I would like to introduce how to wear immediately 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:23.830
 Even the first cherry blossoms are doing so-called d code and open 4 strings 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:24.140
 Three-string two-fret human's triple stride to shake a 1 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.030
 is 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:31.920
 3 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:37.560
 Yes I think the shape of the so-called t action that appears in the board book or something like this 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:43.010
 The right hand plays with the fingers The fingers use the thumb and forefinger and the middle finger 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:46.900
 I will play with these three fingers and with the pattern of the right hand 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:54.000
 Well I will introduce the way of the left hand Yes 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:55.380
 Day code 4 items 3 frets 2 frets so it's runaway 3D 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.390
 thumb 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:07.140
 It is King, but the first sound is also the thumb open 4 cases 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:11.220
 Pull up the 4 strings open with your thumb and at the same time pull up the 2 frets of 1 string with your middle finger 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:14.960
 The next is the index spam 2 spam 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:18.290
 Next , return to the 2nd fret of 1 string with your middle finger 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:21.860
 It is fine without picking the thumb at this time 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.340
 Finally in it will go also to the 3rd fret of the 2-string with the index finger 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.920
 With this hot spring 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.020
 Good good 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.080
 Good good 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.890
 DEA 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.890
 Something like this 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.770
 Hmm 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:44.400
 Iiii doctor 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:48.920
 Yes this one set only first practice right child's thumb and index finger and middle finger 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:54.900
 The next exercise when you fit the combination firmly to the body 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:59.879
 I think that you can learn a very fast when you say the following code 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:03.130
 I think that it is the point to play it out and to receive the reception as well as possible 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:04.120
 Another right point as another point 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.840
 No 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:13.599
 Little finger also good ring finger good 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:20.440
 I When the Kedomo I'm wearing both'll stabilize the right hand raised with the body 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:24.550
 I think that you can have a stable arupe place without the right hand fluttering, so please try it 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:27.820
 So you think you want to go to the next code 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:30.840
 This code is fine without change 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.910
 However the route changes 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:37.040
 3 frets of 6 strings 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:42.560
 Hold this with your thumb Hold it with your thumb 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:44.640
 I think I'm listening to the 4 string release a while earlier, but instead 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:50.280
 This base 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.760
 It sounds like g. I will play with the 6th string 3 fret thumb . 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.050
 is 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.850
 It does not change 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.290
 Hmm 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.319
 Hmm 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.319
 Hm 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:03.240
 Something like this 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:05.000
 I 'm reading g's t because I 'm so disgusted that the base will come next 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.000
 I will 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
 Hmm 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:17.150
 Yes, it feels like it's like connecting the first recode and this enough d code 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.150
 Hmm 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.350
 Hm 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:28.169
 But I think that such is the ne Yes here is not so difficult to feel this thumb 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:38.670
 Because this pattern which suppresses the route with this comes out well, if you can learn here by all means again 

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:41.700
 I do not think you do not it can also be used in a different song 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:43.730
 The next bass sound will be a 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.730
 Hmm 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:51.500
 This route is the first 200 when there is only a person who has a rude time 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:59.249
 It does not change 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:05:01.960
 I will give a look with the middle finger to the rule of talking a of such an open string with the thumb 

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:04.540
 Place to escape with the index finger 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:08.409
 Conditioned It is your bed seed 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:11.589
 But if it is rare next 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:15.020
 Also I'd return to the middle finger of the right hand middle finger 

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:18.680
 Please give me a look under liberation 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:21.160
 The illusionary work with the index finger 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.460
 Such a feeling when continuing 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.460
 Hmm 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.460
 Hmm 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.880
 Hmm 

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:37.959
 Will this also round and round the loop after you have here only strain changes it looks like 

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:39.989
 I'm just pulling slowly from the beginning 

00:05:37.959 --> 00:05:39.989
 Hmm 

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:46.920
 yeah yeah 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.160
 Something like this 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.160
 You do 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:57.710
 Also be done slowly slowly and carefully what laps anymore what lap so she can this more and more loop 

00:05:57.199 --> 00:05:59.000
 Go 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:05.870
 that 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:08.390
 Sometimes Well point play I think you base and can learn the bassist even if the feelings 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:11.720
 Would not it a good place Tteyuu'll pull 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:15.850
 Because the base is progressing with a very pleasant and good feeling 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.850
 Please feel free to give me a bassist feel . 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:33.390
 Even if I give it to this one, I will do it 

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:37.380
 Because it is a phrase that sounds good 

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:37.740
 If you don't have Equita , I think it will be a good practice phrase with acoustic guitar 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.050
 I will 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:42.590
 Audi a and the way like this 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.590
 God Eater 

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:45.139
 What 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:51.740
 Uzan 

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:51.740
 Yes, I do say is such a feeling 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.260
 Wait 

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:04.949
 me 

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:07.950
 Yes I'm thinking how I like Rafako Day but I like it 

00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:11.600
 If you are a band , of course electric guitar day 

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:15.920
 Even if you do not have air conditioning at home 

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:20.060
 Please try it by all means because it is a beautiful thing dead language 

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:24.780
 What did you say? With ellegarden's luxury ship 

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:26.020
 The sound school on the right hand practice floor also has more and more routes and practice 

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:29.050
 By all means 

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:32.759
 How about taking it into daily practice 

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:32.759
 Then we sell in this neighborhood today
