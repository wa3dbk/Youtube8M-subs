00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.930
 no no 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.840
 Hi, guys and girls, what if 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.490
 of yours I'm with a new video and good 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.630
 here we are in the second channel of 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.130
 again the truth is that it was very 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.769
 time I did not upload video I ask you 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.890
 sorry for that and well I love you 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:32.410
 say and finally almost certainly I'm going to 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.789
 get a capturing as you know 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.309
 is capturing now the 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:40.539
 team the same internal but for me it is 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:42.039
 a mess is a mess the subject of catching 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:44.199
 the clips you have to upload them to 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:46.089
 integrate to the internet after downloading them 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:48.069
 new edit the video such and it is a medium 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:49.839
 that you shit and good with the capture 

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:51.100
 I will be able to give more to the channel 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:53.109
 secondary that the truth is that I have 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.569
 You also want to hit the channel 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:57.819
 secondary good those I bring a video of 

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:59.079
 nba 2k 14 in this case doing on the 

00:00:57.819 --> 00:01:00.459
 truth is that this game mode is very 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.600
 similar to ultimate and it's called my 

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:03.399
 team 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.799
 the big differences I think that the 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.960
 older the subject of the market can not be 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.790
 sell the players by auction and the 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.070
 people but if you want to sell a 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.530
 player give you the current value you have 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.479
 that player is to say as if what 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.310
 will discard but do not always give you the 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.320
 same money can raise the value of the 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.580
 that player's market or it can go down and 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.440
 the truth is that it is the subject I like 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.670
 why else would this guy become 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.740
 last team that people would buy 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.659
 many currencies the resale and such and such 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.759
 and not the truth I would be cool theme 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.399
 of the envelopes are very good your envelopes 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:35.319
 are much more accessible depends on which 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:36.610
 over clear there are some that are very 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:40.450
 expensive but human you can buy 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.899
 about in fact I bought about what 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.940
 that are quite accessible look they touched 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.640
 very good legends of the best 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.440
 the whole story of nba 2 but it's not that 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.390
 I think and the truth is that it is very 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.460
 cool the subject of the envelopes there are many 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.520
 many types of envelopes 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:01.270
 envelopes of legend the lakers of 90 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.800
 the chicago bulls from 98 the 92 and so 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.119
 like that is that there are many types of 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.860
 envelopes that you can open and the truth is 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.150
 that this gameplay is very cool 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.100
 everyone who likes basketball 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.810
 I recommend it a lot, I already tell you that I 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.340
 in real life I do not follow much the 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.980
 basketball and I 'm still learning 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.110
 many things about the topic of the 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.300
 rules when playing the game of 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.190
 players and this and that of extras 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.870
 strategy and such but the truth is that 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.300
 the game is very good I think it's the 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.650
 best game of childhood and certainly if you 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.110
 like basketball you have to buy 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.510
 yes or yes and nothing we are going to put a cap 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.660
 of about 20 lights and if you come to the entity 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.760
 likes tomorrow there was a video showing the 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.230
 equipment that I currently have a 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.890
 lot of legends the truth is 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.230
 giving the game a lot of steam and as 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.700
 gave you when you have the capture of the 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.290
 next week that is to say we are today to 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.450
 Saturday, I hope you have it on Monday 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.000
 Tuesday or Wednesday you can upload more 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.180
 more quantity 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.640
 and more variety more often in this channel 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.320
 and because I want it if I have the 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.300
 possibility I want it to become a 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.830
 channel where I'm going to go up pretty nba like this 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.540
 How good I hope it can be done and 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.790
 that everything was fine so nothing 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.640

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.150

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.890
