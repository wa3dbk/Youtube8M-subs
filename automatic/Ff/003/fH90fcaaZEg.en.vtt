00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:12.350
 hello today we are going to talk about the two 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.590
 most basic stitches straight stitch and zig 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:18.679
 zag let's sew first with the assembled 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:22.099
 1 which is the straight stitch with the long 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:23.599
 to 3 and the width to 5 that we do not care 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:25.520
 at the moment because the straight stitch does not 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:29.530
 It has width 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.530
 we hold the threads with a finger 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:43.970
 this is the result 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.970
 now let's change the length to 4 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.110
 two 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.820
 as you can see the difference is quite noticeable 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.120
 long 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.780
 now we try a very short stitch 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.780
 putting it to 1 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.040
 make a straight stitch so small no 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.290
 It's worth it because as you see it's very 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.990
 irregular 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.450
 and we increase a little bit until 2 and 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.760
 let's try to put the width to 0 that 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.950
 in the straight stitch what we do with 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.900
 the width to 0 is that the needle thing in the 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.880
 left part you're going to see what's 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.880
 a greater distance between seams 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.440
 this is the result 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.750
 let's change point zig zag in this 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.030
 machine is 3 the long I'll leave the 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.570
 2 and the width we will put the maximum that 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.570
 it's 5 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.080
 now I upload the length to 4 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.020
 Now I'm going to make a very short appointment 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.020
 putting it to 1 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.150
 using the same stitch and only 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.370
 changing the length you see what results 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.040
 so different can you get in the 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.490
 first part we used a long 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:00.670
 medium in the central part we have used a 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:03.640
 long to 4 and in the last part a long 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.640
 to 1 but at no time have we 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.620
 modified the width of the stitch 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.920
 so you can see how the width varies 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.410
 let's sew on tape with a fixed length 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.950
 to 3 and we start with the maximum width that 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.950
 it's 5 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:26.719
 I keep the stitch length and I 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.870
 He modified the width to 3 and a half 

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:28.870
 or less 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.239
 and now I put it until 1 and a half 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.900
 in this case using the same stitch 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.409
 of zig zag what we have done is 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.420
 decrease the width and although the length 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:55.250
 it remains always the same you see as the 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.879
 stitch is becoming more and more 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:01.610
 close now I'm going to make a sample 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:04.310
 of the maximum and the minimum I put the length to 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.700
 four and a half more or less and the width at 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.700
 five 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.880
 now I will put the length to 1 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.820
 and the wide student too 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.930
 between the widest and longest stitch and the 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.520
 shorter and narrower you have a lot of 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.770
 possibilities to go testing 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.690
 we have finished for today I hope that you 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.340
 have served everything that you explained and 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.849
 If you have any questions, tell me about 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.849
