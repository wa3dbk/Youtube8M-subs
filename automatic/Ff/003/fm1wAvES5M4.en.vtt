00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
point that maybe this thing could sweep

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.729 
point that maybe this thing could sweep
me<00:02:09.720> if<00:02:09.810> he<00:02:09.899> was<00:02:10.020> running<00:02:10.200> like<00:02:10.349> a<00:02:10.379> trick<00:02:10.590> home

team it could be a trick routine just
because

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
because

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.809 
because

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
can go out so my thumb nurse actually

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.660 
can go out so my thumb nurse actually
chooses<00:02:25.830> one<00:02:25.980> road<00:02:26.160> just<00:02:26.310> because<00:02:26.489> I<00:02:26.550> am

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
chooses one road just because I am

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.369 
chooses one road just because I am
choice<00:02:26.910> Bannon<00:02:27.390> and<00:02:27.510> I<00:02:27.690> figured<00:02:27.959> a<00:02:28.019> playoff

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
choice Bannon and I figured a playoff

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.610 
choice Bannon and I figured a playoff
would<00:02:28.530> knock<00:02:28.739> him<00:02:28.890> out<00:02:29.069> even<00:02:29.849> with<00:02:30.000> the

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
would knock him out even with the

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.660 
would knock him out even with the
reflect<00:02:31.620> but<00:02:31.739> I<00:02:31.769> decided<00:02:32.010> to<00:02:32.099> go<00:02:32.190> for<00:02:32.220> knockoff

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
reflect but I decided to go for knockoff

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.610 
reflect but I decided to go for knockoff
just<00:02:33.150> in<00:02:33.269> case<00:02:33.450> he<00:02:33.630> wants<00:02:33.660> to<00:02:33.900> switch<00:02:34.019> out<00:02:34.200> I<00:02:34.380> I

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
just in case he wants to switch out I I

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.280 
just in case he wants to switch out I I
was<00:02:34.920> pretty<00:02:35.310> sure<00:02:35.550> if<00:02:35.819> he<00:02:36.239> was<00:02:36.420> trick<00:02:36.780> defog<00:02:37.140> he

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
was pretty sure if he was trick defog he

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.690 
was pretty sure if he was trick defog he
would<00:02:37.410> go<00:02:37.500> for<00:02:37.680> defog<00:02:37.950> right<00:02:38.130> there<00:02:38.310> or<00:02:38.459> switch

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
would go for defog right there or switch

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.440 
would go for defog right there or switch
onto<00:02:38.880> Slowbro<00:02:39.420> or<00:02:40.670> order<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.790> keys<00:02:42.030> but

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
onto Slowbro or order the keys but

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.059 
onto Slowbro or order the keys but
either<00:02:42.780> way<00:02:43.110> I<00:02:43.140> would<00:02:43.530> have<00:02:43.620> been<00:02:43.650> fine<00:02:43.890> we're

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
either way I would have been fine we're

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.289 
either way I would have been fine we're
going<00:02:44.190> for<00:02:44.310> knockoff<00:02:44.580> so<00:02:44.700> I<00:02:44.730> decide<00:02:44.970> to<00:02:45.000> go<00:02:45.090> for

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
going for knockoff so I decide to go for

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:46.610 
going for knockoff so I decide to go for
a<00:02:45.330> double<00:02:45.420> knock<00:02:45.690> off<00:02:45.870> just<00:02:46.049> because<00:02:46.319> and

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
a double knock off just because and

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.070 
a double knock off just because and
non-life<00:02:47.340> force<00:02:47.670> I<00:02:47.880> shock<00:02:48.150> will<00:02:48.690> barely<00:02:48.930> be

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
non-life force I shock will barely be

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.509 
non-life force I shock will barely be
doing<00:02:49.560> like<00:02:50.430> 40%<00:02:51.420> to<00:02:51.810> me<00:02:51.959> so<00:02:52.200> I<00:02:52.430> ended<00:02:53.430> up

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
doing like 40% to me so I ended up

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.250 
doing like 40% to me so I ended up
catching<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.970> Slowbro<00:02:54.390> up<00:02:54.569> on<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.900> switching

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
catching the Slowbro up on the switching

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.690 
catching the Slowbro up on the switching
getting<00:02:55.500> rid<00:02:55.590> of<00:02:55.680> its<00:02:55.829> rocky<00:02:56.069> helmet<00:02:56.340> I<00:02:56.459> decide

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
getting rid of its rocky helmet I decide

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.920 
getting rid of its rocky helmet I decide
to<00:02:56.730> go<00:02:56.880> for<00:02:56.910> double<00:02:57.180> knock<00:02:57.420> off<00:02:57.569> just<00:02:57.750> because

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
to go for double knock off just because

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.660 
to go for double knock off just because
if<00:02:58.319> you<00:02:58.410> want<00:02:58.560> to<00:02:58.680> double<00:02:58.829> predicting<00:02:59.459> my

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
if you want to double predicting my

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.569 
if you want to double predicting my
Celebi<00:03:00.329> or<00:03:00.510> if<00:03:01.049> you<00:03:01.170> want<00:03:01.349> to<00:03:01.440> go<00:03:01.650> for<00:03:02.010> ice

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
Celebi or if you want to go for ice

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:03.710 
Celebi or if you want to go for ice
cream<00:03:02.940> or<00:03:03.060> something<00:03:03.209> predicting<00:03:03.599> that

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
cream or something predicting that

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.880 
cream or something predicting that
that's<00:03:03.900> when<00:03:04.049> he<00:03:04.140> would<00:03:04.260> reveal<00:03:04.530> it<00:03:04.709> so<00:03:04.829> he

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
that's when he would reveal it so he

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.650 
that's when he would reveal it so he
ends<00:03:05.040> up<00:03:05.130> feeling<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.519> trick<00:03:05.760> room<00:03:05.910> as<00:03:06.090> once

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
ends up feeling the trick room as once

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.330 
ends up feeling the trick room as once
again<00:03:06.900> I<00:03:06.930> could<00:03:07.079> just<00:03:07.200> click<00:03:07.380> knock<00:03:07.620> off<00:03:07.860> as

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
again I could just click knock off as

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.270 
again I could just click knock off as
his<00:03:08.640> reflect<00:03:09.090> is<00:03:09.360> gonna<00:03:09.959> go<00:03:10.079> down<00:03:10.260> and<00:03:10.590> he's

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
his reflect is gonna go down and he's

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.710 
his reflect is gonna go down and he's
gonna<00:03:11.370> bring<00:03:11.519> out<00:03:11.610> his<00:03:11.670> teacher<00:03:12.000> makes<00:03:12.630> a

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
gonna bring out his teacher makes a

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.210 
gonna bring out his teacher makes a
really<00:03:12.870> good<00:03:12.989> play<00:03:13.170> right<00:03:13.319> here<00:03:13.349> doubles<00:03:13.950> into

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
really good play right here doubles into

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.940 
really good play right here doubles into
his<00:03:14.670> Garchomp<00:03:15.239> or<00:03:15.450> doubles<00:03:16.349> into<00:03:16.530> a<00:03:16.560> slope<00:03:16.829> or

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
his Garchomp or doubles into a slope or

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.470 
his Garchomp or doubles into a slope or
rather<00:03:17.100> predicting<00:03:17.700> my<00:03:17.819> Garchomp<00:03:18.030> so<00:03:18.359> that

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
rather predicting my Garchomp so that

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.670 
rather predicting my Garchomp so that
was<00:03:18.569> a<00:03:18.600> good<00:03:18.720> play<00:03:18.900> because<00:03:19.049> he<00:03:19.230> got<00:03:19.319> the<00:03:19.470> free

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
was a good play because he got the free

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.160 
was a good play because he got the free
regenerator<00:03:20.250> for<00:03:20.850> his<00:03:20.940> Slowbro<00:03:21.450> and<00:03:21.660> I'm

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
regenerator for his Slowbro and I'm

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.599 
regenerator for his Slowbro and I'm
definitely<00:03:22.440> gonna<00:03:22.709> be<00:03:22.799> scared<00:03:23.160> out<00:03:23.310> one

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
definitely gonna be scared out one

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.809 
definitely gonna be scared out one
because<00:03:24.030> trick<00:03:24.329> room<00:03:24.480> is<00:03:24.690> up<00:03:24.930> and<00:03:25.549> two<00:03:26.549> because

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
because trick room is up and two because

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:28.490 
because trick room is up and two because
he<00:03:26.850> could<00:03:27.000> definitely<00:03:27.120> threaten<00:03:27.600> me<00:03:27.780> with<00:03:27.810> the

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
he could definitely threaten me with the

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.319 
he could definitely threaten me with the
ice<00:03:29.010> beam<00:03:29.250> so<00:03:29.489> I<00:03:29.670> don't<00:03:29.970> want<00:03:30.090> to<00:03:30.150> take<00:03:30.299> that

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
ice beam so I don't want to take that

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:31.879 
ice beam so I don't want to take that
ice<00:03:30.810> at<00:03:31.049> that<00:03:31.230> I'll<00:03:31.319> pull<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:31.560> switch<00:03:31.709> out

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
ice at that I'll pull the switch out

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:35.509 
ice at that I'll pull the switch out
into<00:03:32.130> my<00:03:32.220> keys<00:03:32.430> because<00:03:32.670> I'm<00:03:33.660> spinel<00:03:34.139> and<00:03:34.519> I

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
into my keys because I'm spinel and I

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.520 
into my keys because I'm spinel and I
could<00:03:36.090> take<00:03:36.269> anything<00:03:36.630> he<00:03:36.900> wants<00:03:37.139> to<00:03:37.230> go<00:03:37.350> for

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
could take anything he wants to go for

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.229 
could take anything he wants to go for
honestly<00:03:37.829> this<00:03:38.069> is<00:03:38.220> also<00:03:38.519> a<00:03:38.549> good<00:03:38.670> opportunity

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
honestly this is also a good opportunity

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.390 
honestly this is also a good opportunity
for<00:03:39.540> me<00:03:39.720> to<00:03:39.750> find<00:03:40.019> out<00:03:40.260> if<00:03:40.470> he's<00:03:40.859> defensive<00:03:41.280> or

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
for me to find out if he's defensive or

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.890 
for me to find out if he's defensive or
not<00:03:41.519> just<00:03:41.790> based<00:03:41.970> on<00:03:42.060> a<00:03:42.120> knockoff<00:03:42.480> damage<00:03:42.780> I'm

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
not just based on a knockoff damage I'm

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.000 
not just based on a knockoff damage I'm
pretty<00:03:43.079> sure<00:03:43.260> he's<00:03:43.440> running<00:03:43.650> a<00:03:43.709> bit<00:03:43.889> of

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
pretty sure he's running a bit of

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.610 
pretty sure he's running a bit of
Defense<00:03:44.340> on<00:03:44.639> the<00:03:45.209> Slowbro<00:03:45.660> so<00:03:45.870> him<00:03:46.260> go<00:03:46.350> for<00:03:46.530> my

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
Defense on the Slowbro so him go for my

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.379 
Defense on the Slowbro so him go for my
spike<00:03:46.920> I<00:03:47.100> got<00:03:47.370> rid<00:03:47.489> of<00:03:47.579> his<00:03:47.670> defogger<00:03:48.180> I<00:03:48.239> don't

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
spike I got rid of his defogger I don't

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.660 
spike I got rid of his defogger I don't
know<00:03:48.450> if<00:03:48.510> his<00:03:48.630> Zapdos<00:03:49.019> has<00:03:49.170> defog<00:03:49.590> but<00:03:49.950> I'm

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
know if his Zapdos has defog but I'm

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.509 
know if his Zapdos has defog but I'm
playing<00:03:51.239> as<00:03:51.480> it<00:03:51.600> he<00:03:51.959> doesn't<00:03:52.380> so<00:03:52.889> we<00:03:53.100> go<00:03:53.340> for<00:03:53.430> my

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
playing as it he doesn't so we go for my

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:54.680 
playing as it he doesn't so we go for my
first<00:03:53.700> later<00:03:53.850> spike<00:03:54.090> as<00:03:54.299> he<00:03:54.420> ends<00:03:54.540> up<00:03:54.600> going

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
first later spike as he ends up going

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.000 
first later spike as he ends up going
for<00:03:54.870> flamethrower<00:03:55.260> and<00:03:55.440> gets<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.680> burn<00:03:55.829> I

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
for flamethrower and gets the burn I

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.059 
for flamethrower and gets the burn I
wasn't<00:03:56.430> really<00:03:56.609> -<00:03:57.060> I<00:03:57.769> didn't<00:03:58.769> really<00:03:58.920> matter

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
wasn't really - I didn't really matter

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:00.650 
wasn't really - I didn't really matter
to<00:03:59.250> me<00:03:59.280> because<00:03:59.609> if<00:03:59.700> he<00:04:00.060> had<00:04:00.239> he<00:04:00.299> went<00:04:00.480> Force

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
to me because if he had he went Force

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:01.879 
to me because if he had he went Force
College<00:04:00.959> he<00:04:01.079> still<00:04:01.260> had<00:04:01.349> that<00:04:01.410> chance<00:04:01.620> to<00:04:01.769> burn

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:01.889 
College he still had that chance to burn

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:03.830 
College he still had that chance to burn
anyway<00:04:02.220> so<00:04:02.280> I<00:04:02.609> didn't<00:04:02.970> really<00:04:03.120> care<00:04:03.269> as<00:04:03.480> I'm

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
anyway so I didn't really care as I'm

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.150 
anyway so I didn't really care as I'm
gonna<00:04:03.959> go<00:04:04.079> for<00:04:04.170> my<00:04:04.260> second<00:04:04.620> layer<00:04:04.739> of<00:04:04.829> spike

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
gonna go for my second layer of spike

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.800 
gonna go for my second layer of spike
and<00:04:05.370> this<00:04:05.609> is<00:04:05.730> really<00:04:05.940> gonna<00:04:06.180> work<00:04:06.269> out<00:04:06.540> in<00:04:06.690> my

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
and this is really gonna work out in my

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.870 
and this is really gonna work out in my

this steelix I also could have went for
a<00:05:14.880> recover<00:05:15.330> but<00:05:16.400> because<00:05:17.900> the<00:05:18.900> sand<00:05:19.170> was

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
a recover but because the sand was

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.920 
a recover but because the sand was
ending<00:05:19.770> this<00:05:20.490> turn<00:05:20.820> and<00:05:21.240> I'd<00:05:21.510> be<00:05:21.660> getting<00:05:21.840> my

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.550 
leftovers I figured I wouldn't need it
for<00:05:24.330> the<00:05:24.510> steel<00:05:24.720> edges<00:05:24.960> to<00:05:25.050> be<00:05:25.080> able<00:05:25.320> to<00:05:25.410> take

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
for the steel edges to be able to take

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.170 
for the steel edges to be able to take
it<00:05:25.680> on<00:05:25.800> though<00:05:26.310> a<00:05:26.340> crit<00:05:26.670> wouldn't<00:05:26.940> have<00:05:27.030> been

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
it on though a crit wouldn't have been

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.510 
it on though a crit wouldn't have been
too<00:05:27.690> nice<00:05:27.870> right<00:05:28.110> there<00:05:28.350> but<00:05:28.620> I<00:05:28.860> decide<00:05:29.430> to

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
too nice right there but I decide to

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.980 
too nice right there but I decide to
switch<00:05:29.700> out<00:05:29.850> now<00:05:29.970> into<00:05:30.240> my<00:05:30.270> camera<00:05:30.660> as<00:05:30.810> it's

switch out now into my camera as it's

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.690 
switch out now into my camera as it's
basically<00:05:31.290> a<00:05:31.410> spree<00:05:31.680> switch<00:05:31.920> and<00:05:32.160> what<00:05:32.370> I<00:05:32.400> can

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700 
basically a spree switch and what I can

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.790 
basically a spree switch and what I can
do<00:05:33.000> is<00:05:33.240> just<00:05:33.540> get<00:05:33.900> up<00:05:34.020> my<00:05:34.110> stealth<00:05:34.380> rock<00:05:34.620> as
