00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
my lot my long a trip here when the

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.330 
my lot my long a trip here when the
buttons<00:04:07.959> pressed<00:04:08.139> it<00:04:08.349> sends<00:04:08.560> a<00:04:08.590> pulse<00:04:08.769> and<00:04:09.099> it

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
buttons pressed it sends a pulse and it

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.520 
buttons pressed it sends a pulse and it
goes<00:04:09.639> along<00:04:09.790> there<00:04:10.150> but<00:04:10.900> then<00:04:11.019> it<00:04:11.139> also<00:04:11.260> comes

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
goes along there but then it also comes

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.129 
goes along there but then it also comes
down<00:04:11.709> here<00:04:11.919> and<00:04:12.479> it<00:04:13.479> takes<00:04:13.629> all<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:13.900> time<00:04:14.109> i

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
down here and it takes all the time i

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:16.560 
down here and it takes all the time i
get<00:04:14.290> through<00:04:14.470> there<00:04:14.760> so<00:04:15.760> the<00:04:15.940> when<00:04:16.299> it's<00:04:16.419> sent

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
get through there so the when it's sent

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.830 
get through there so the when it's sent
along<00:04:16.780> here<00:04:17.109> it<00:04:17.889> goes<00:04:18.070> to<00:04:18.190> the<00:04:18.220> extender<00:04:18.840> and

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
along here it goes to the extender and

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.750 
along here it goes to the extender and
then<00:04:20.530> by<00:04:20.769> the<00:04:20.799> time<00:04:20.919> that<00:04:21.070> that's<00:04:21.400> run<00:04:21.609> out

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
then by the time that that's run out

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.879 
then by the time that that's run out
this<00:04:22.659> pulls<00:04:22.870> from<00:04:23.080> down<00:04:23.260> there<00:04:23.440> come<00:04:23.620> through

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
this pulls from down there come through

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:27.000 
this pulls from down there come through
which<00:04:24.250> just<00:04:24.460> makes<00:04:24.610> it<00:04:24.729> longer<00:04:25.770> that<00:04:26.770> was<00:04:26.860> just

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
which just makes it longer that was just

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.050 
which just makes it longer that was just
something<00:04:27.130> I<00:04:27.250> was<00:04:27.340> trying<00:04:27.550> it<00:04:27.699> didn't<00:04:27.940> work

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
something I was trying it didn't work

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.320 
something I was trying it didn't work
out<00:04:28.210> and<00:04:28.360> I<00:04:28.419> never<00:04:28.599> bother<00:04:28.780> picking<00:04:28.960> up<00:04:30.330> yeah

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
out and I never bother picking up yeah

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.230 
out and I never bother picking up yeah
all<00:04:32.139> this<00:04:32.409> through<00:04:32.620> here<00:04:32.830> is<00:04:34.020> like<00:04:35.020> II

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
all this through here is like II

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.969 
all this through here is like II
basically<00:04:37.240> the<00:04:38.110> pulse<00:04:38.349> runs<00:04:38.560> along<00:04:38.740> the<00:04:38.770> back

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
basically the pulse runs along the back

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:40.740 
basically the pulse runs along the back
wall<00:04:39.009> and<00:04:39.699> then<00:04:39.970> every<00:04:40.150> time<00:04:40.180> it<00:04:40.389> gets<00:04:40.479> to<00:04:40.599> a

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
wall and then every time it gets to a

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.260 
wall and then every time it gets to a
repeater<00:04:41.349> it<00:04:41.889> comes<00:04:42.159> through<00:04:42.430> obviously

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
repeater it comes through obviously

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.420 
repeater it comes through obviously
these<00:04:43.419> are<00:04:43.479> staggered<00:04:43.960> so<00:04:44.139> that<00:04:44.349> when<00:04:45.190> it<00:04:45.280> gets

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
these are staggered so that when it gets

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.850 
these are staggered so that when it gets
the<00:04:45.580> end<00:04:45.810> just<00:04:46.810> after<00:04:46.960> it<00:04:47.139> passes<00:04:47.380> the<00:04:47.560> next

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
the end just after it passes the next

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.290 
the end just after it passes the next
one<00:04:47.979> comes<00:04:48.190> along<00:04:48.340> and<00:04:48.610> falls<00:04:48.820> it<00:04:49.000> on<00:04:49.090> and<00:04:49.270> then

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
one comes along and falls it on and then

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.629

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
that would falls it on and then they all

00:04:51.639 --> 00:05:01.230 
that would falls it on and then they all
turn<00:04:51.789> around<00:04:52.000> that<00:04:52.120> way<00:04:52.270> why<00:04:52.750> either
