pencil<00:01:25.439> I'll<00:01:25.920> quickly<00:01:26.280> review<00:01:26.610> what<00:01:27.060> we

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
pencil I'll quickly review what we

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.380 
pencil I'll quickly review what we
talked<00:01:27.750> about<00:01:27.869> in<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.409> podcast<00:01:29.210> first<00:01:30.210> we

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
talked about in that podcast first we

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.840 
talked about in that podcast first we
decided<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.869> go<00:01:31.110> with<00:01:31.140> 24<00:01:31.890> frames<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.430> second

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
decided to go with 24 frames a second

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.289 
decided to go with 24 frames a second
which<00:01:33.000> makes<00:01:33.270> very<00:01:33.630> smooth<00:01:34.049> animations<00:01:34.770> and

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
which makes very smooth animations and

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.740 
which makes very smooth animations and
we<00:01:36.299> added<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:37.350> bunch<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:38.189> frames<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.299> we<00:01:39.570> did

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
we added a bunch of frames and we did

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.620 
we added a bunch of frames and we did
that<00:01:40.020> by<00:01:40.350> going<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.979> edit<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.630> preferences

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
that by going to edit and preferences

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.700 
that by going to edit and preferences
and<00:01:43.320> going<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.399> time<00:01:45.329> size<00:01:45.750> in<00:01:46.079> frames<00:01:46.409> and

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
and going to time size in frames and

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.850 
and going to time size in frames and
then<00:01:46.829> typing<00:01:47.280> in<00:01:47.430> 600<00:01:48.299> clicking<00:01:49.259> our<00:01:49.380> timeline

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
then typing in 600 clicking our timeline

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.630 
then typing in 600 clicking our timeline
and<00:01:50.100> clicking<00:01:50.729> on<00:01:50.909> close<00:01:52.040> we<00:01:53.040> found<00:01:53.310> out<00:01:53.460> how

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
and clicking on close we found out how

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.899 
and clicking on close we found out how
many<00:01:53.850> frames<00:01:54.180> we<00:01:54.479> need<00:01:54.720> by<00:01:55.170> multiplying<00:01:55.909> 24

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
many frames we need by multiplying 24

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.679 
many frames we need by multiplying 24
frames<00:01:57.329> times<00:01:57.780> 25<00:01:58.680> seconds<00:01:59.490> which<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.060> just

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
frames times 25 seconds which is just

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.219 
frames times 25 seconds which is just
how<00:02:00.930> long<00:02:01.259> my<00:02:01.770> sound<00:02:02.100> file<00:02:02.399> is<00:02:02.719> at<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.899> magic

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.370 
how long my sound file is at the magic
number<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.700> 600<00:02:05.700> so<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.630> was<00:02:06.810> important<00:02:07.350> to

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
but here we go the three secrets to

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.720 
but here we go the three secrets to
hearing<00:03:42.970> your<00:03:43.090> sound<00:03:43.480> in<00:03:43.930> pencil<00:03:44.829> first<00:03:45.489> you

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
hearing your sound in pencil first you

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.360 
hearing your sound in pencil first you
have<00:03:45.879> to<00:03:45.910> add<00:03:46.150> a<00:03:46.180> keyframe<00:03:46.720> at<00:03:47.290> the<00:03:47.769> end<00:03:47.980> of

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
have to add a keyframe at the end of

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.729 
have to add a keyframe at the end of
your<00:03:48.639> sound<00:03:48.940> file<00:03:49.329> we<00:03:50.019> know<00:03:50.169> that<00:03:50.379> this<00:03:50.500> should

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
your sound file we know that this should

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.789 
your sound file we know that this should
end<00:03:50.980> at<00:03:51.220> frame<00:03:51.760> 600<00:03:52.319> so<00:03:53.319> we'll<00:03:53.470> take<00:03:53.650> that

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
end at frame 600 so we'll take that

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:56.780 
end at frame 600 so we'll take that
bottom<00:03:54.489> bar<00:03:54.669> slide<00:03:55.389> it<00:03:55.569> all<00:03:55.720> the<00:03:56.260> way<00:03:56.379> over

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
bottom bar slide it all the way over

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.080 
bottom bar slide it all the way over
drift<00:03:57.790> around<00:03:58.120> till<00:03:58.359> we<00:03:58.389> find<00:03:58.720> frame<00:03:59.049> 600<00:04:00.090> tap

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
drift around till we find frame 600 tap

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.119 
drift around till we find frame 600 tap
on<00:04:01.269> that<00:04:01.299> and<00:04:01.690> then<00:04:02.049> we<00:04:02.169> go<00:04:02.349> over<00:04:02.379> here<00:04:02.590> to<00:04:02.769> keys

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:03.129

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:18.640 
talk about these play buttons for a

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.850 
talk about these play buttons for a
minute<00:05:19.030> of<00:05:19.600> course<00:05:19.930> this<00:05:20.140> black<00:05:20.530> triangle

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
minute of course this black triangle

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.820 
minute of course this black triangle
means<00:05:21.250> play<00:05:21.640> that<00:05:22.510> bent<00:05:22.810> arrow<00:05:23.080> means<00:05:23.380> loop

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
means play that bent arrow means loop

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.190 
means play that bent arrow means loop
this<00:05:24.370> last<00:05:24.670> one<00:05:24.880> is<00:05:25.030> the<00:05:25.180> speaker<00:05:25.660> button<00:05:25.900> and

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.200 
this last one is the speaker button and

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.050 
this last one is the speaker button and
I<00:05:26.800> don't<00:05:27.100> know<00:05:27.220> why<00:05:27.340> they<00:05:27.520> even<00:05:27.550> bothered<00:05:27.730> to

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
I don't know why they even bothered to

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.490 
I don't know why they even bothered to
put<00:05:28.300> it<00:05:28.420> in<00:05:28.510> there<00:05:28.690> but<00:05:28.870> you<00:05:29.020> can<00:05:29.170> turn<00:05:29.320> your

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
put it in there but you can turn your

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.500 
put it in there but you can turn your
speaker's<00:05:29.680> off<00:05:30.040> so<00:05:30.340> your<00:05:30.550> sound<00:05:31.210> doesn't

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510 
speaker's off so your sound doesn't

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.420 
speaker's off so your sound doesn't
bother<00:05:31.690> you<00:05:31.870> I<00:05:31.960> guess<00:05:32.230> this<00:05:33.100> would<00:05:33.280> be<00:05:33.310> a

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
bother you I guess this would be a

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.280 
bother you I guess this would be a
really<00:05:33.790> good<00:05:34.060> time<00:05:34.330> to<00:05:34.540> save<00:05:34.780> your<00:05:34.990> file

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:35.290 
really good time to save your file

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.560 
really good time to save your file
pencil<00:05:36.070> is<00:05:36.160> not<00:05:36.190> the<00:05:36.520> most<00:05:36.670> stable<00:05:36.850> program

pencil is not the most stable program

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.990 
pencil is not the most stable program
around<00:05:37.810> so<00:05:38.200> I<00:05:38.230> do<00:05:38.320> a<00:05:38.440> lot<00:05:38.650> of<00:05:38.680> saves<00:05:39.070> the<00:05:39.790> first
