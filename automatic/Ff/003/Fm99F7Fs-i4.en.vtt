trying to few carats in this year long
ones<00:01:26.610> just<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:26.909> see<00:01:27.030> if<00:01:27.119> they<00:01:27.180> get<00:01:27.299> any<00:01:27.420> bigger

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.060 
ones just to see if they get any bigger
and<00:01:27.810> safe<00:01:27.990> but<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.320> little<00:01:28.530> bit<00:01:28.619> bigger<00:01:28.860> book

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070

and safe but a little bit bigger book
just<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.490> try<00:01:30.229> so<00:01:31.229> that's<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.530> polytunnel

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
just to try so that's the polytunnel

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.090 
just to try so that's the polytunnel
nice<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.729> clean<00:01:33.560> so<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.619> should<00:01:34.799> let<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:34.979> bit

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
nice and clean so it should let a bit

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.100 
nice and clean so it should let a bit
more<00:01:35.280> light<00:01:35.520> in<00:01:35.790> hopefully<00:01:36.240> we<00:01:36.630> get<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.810> rubbish

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
more light in hopefully we get a rubbish

summer like last year we know some need
every<00:01:38.909> bit<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.350> light<00:01:40.350> we<00:01:40.530> can<00:01:40.560> get<00:01:40.860> so<00:01:41.610> like<00:01:42.060> I

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
every bit of light we can get so like I

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.340 
every bit of light we can get so like I
said<00:01:42.240> there's<00:01:42.479> not<00:01:42.570> much<00:01:42.720> going<00:01:42.899> on<00:01:43.110> others
