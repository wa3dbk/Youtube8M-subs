00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
stuff's quite thick I'm gonna snip up a

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.540 
stuff's quite thick I'm gonna snip up a
section<00:01:29.170> and<00:01:29.380> what<00:01:29.770> I'm<00:01:29.830> going<00:01:30.040> to<00:01:30.070> do<00:01:30.310> is<00:01:30.430> if

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
section and what I'm going to do is if

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:31.850 
section and what I'm going to do is if
we<00:01:30.640> can<00:01:30.760> just<00:01:30.850> show<00:01:30.970> this<00:01:31.180> to<00:01:31.330> the<00:01:31.420> camera

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
we can just show this to the camera

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.860 
we can just show this to the camera
which<00:01:32.860> strip<00:01:33.130> the<00:01:33.220> flume<00:01:33.460> away<00:01:33.750> what<00:01:34.750> that

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
which strip the flume away what that

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.470 
which strip the flume away what that
leaves<00:01:35.080> me<00:01:35.260> is<00:01:35.350> with<00:01:35.440> the<00:01:35.530> twisted<00:01:35.860> core<00:01:36.480> this

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480 
leaves me is with the twisted core this

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.800 
leaves me is with the twisted core this
was<00:01:37.659> something<00:01:37.870> fly<00:01:38.110> being<00:01:38.320> too<00:01:38.500> bulky<00:01:39.630> if<00:01:40.630> you

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
was something fly being too bulky if you

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.200 
was something fly being too bulky if you
can<00:01:40.960> see<00:01:41.200> that<00:01:41.409> then<00:01:41.650> I<00:01:41.950> know<00:01:42.250> it's<00:01:42.400> small<00:01:42.610> its

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
can see that then I know it's small its

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.240 
can see that then I know it's small its
then<00:01:43.560> that's<00:01:44.560> the<00:01:44.650> way<00:01:44.740> we're<00:01:44.890> going<00:01:45.010> to<00:01:45.070> tie

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
then that's the way we're going to tie

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.290 
then that's the way we're going to tie
into<00:01:45.430> the<00:01:45.520> hook<00:01:45.640> shank<00:01:47.820> Tyler<00:01:48.820> sent<00:01:49.030> to<00:01:49.180> my

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
into the hook shank Tyler sent to my

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
into the hook shank Tyler sent to my
side<00:01:50.430> so<00:01:51.430> that<00:01:51.460> when<00:01:52.360> I<00:01:52.420> actually<00:01:52.600> start<00:01:53.050> ton

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
side so that when I actually start ton

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.670 
side so that when I actually start ton
initially<00:01:53.740> I'll<00:01:53.830> clockwise<00:01:54.340> up<00:01:54.610> the<00:01:54.700> body<00:01:55.680> the

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
initially I'll clockwise up the body the

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.380 
initially I'll clockwise up the body the
actual<00:01:57.100> proper<00:01:57.490> shiny<00:01:57.729> on<00:01:57.820> what<00:01:58.000> the<00:01:58.120> court

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
actual proper shiny on what the court

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.260 
actual proper shiny on what the court
will<00:01:58.690> start<00:01:59.170> when<00:01:59.500> our<00:01:59.650> waned

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
will start when our waned

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.340 
will start when our waned
so<00:02:01.270> you've<00:02:01.390> actually<00:02:01.479> got<00:02:01.780> the<00:02:01.810> thin<00:02:02.049> cord

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
so you've actually got the thin cord

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.039 
so you've actually got the thin cord
rail<00:02:02.799> line<00:02:03.010> the<00:02:03.040> hook<00:02:03.250> shank<00:02:03.520> and<00:02:04.450> the<00:02:04.840> thick

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
rail line the hook shank and the thick

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:06.210 
rail line the hook shank and the thick
stuff<00:02:05.290> just<00:02:05.530> where<00:02:05.680> I'm<00:02:05.770> going<00:02:05.950> to<00:02:06.010> start

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
stuff just where I'm going to start

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.410 
stuff just where I'm going to start
doing<00:02:06.340> what<00:02:06.490> I'm<00:02:06.760> going<00:02:06.940> to<00:02:06.970> do<00:02:07.119> you<00:02:07.270> you'll

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
the tail in the body no go ahead and

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.750 
the tail in the body no go ahead and
tell<00:02:53.440> you<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:53.650> hot<00:02:53.770> the<00:02:54.010> head<00:02:54.190> hackle

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
tell you the hot the head hackle

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.020 
tell you the hot the head hackle
so<00:02:55.240> what<00:02:55.420> I<00:02:55.450> need<00:02:55.570> to<00:02:55.690> do<00:02:55.810> first<00:02:56.080> of<00:02:56.230> all<00:02:56.380> is

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
so what I need to do first of all is

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.720 
so what I need to do first of all is
select<00:02:58.030> a<00:02:58.180> hackle<00:03:01.110> so<00:03:02.110> that<00:03:02.230> we<00:03:02.350> have<00:03:02.560> one<00:03:02.830> I'll

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
select a hackle so that we have one I'll

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.160 
select a hackle so that we have one I'll
probably<00:03:03.850> use<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.270> tip<00:03:04.570> of<00:03:04.750> this<00:03:04.840> this<00:03:05.020> is<00:03:05.140> a

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
probably use the tip of this this is a

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.680 
probably use the tip of this this is a
generic<00:03:05.590> hip<00:03:05.980> I'll<00:03:06.670> probably<00:03:06.940> use<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:07.270> tip<00:03:07.510> of

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
generic hip I'll probably use the tip of

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.390 
generic hip I'll probably use the tip of
this<00:03:07.840> I'm<00:03:08.050> looking<00:03:08.170> for<00:03:08.470> one-and-a-half

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
this I'm looking for one-and-a-half

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.460 
this I'm looking for one-and-a-half
times<00:03:09.940> the<00:03:12.000> depth<00:03:13.000> of<00:03:13.180> the<00:03:13.270> hood<00:03:13.420> barb<00:03:13.720> which

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
times the depth of the hood barb which

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.210 
times the depth of the hood barb which
is<00:03:14.620> about<00:03:14.800> BA<00:03:15.160> one<00:03:15.430> near<00:03:15.730> so<00:03:16.480> if<00:03:16.540> I<00:03:16.630> strip<00:03:17.220> the
