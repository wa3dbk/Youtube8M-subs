perks the guns everything and so far
it's<00:00:51.719> looking<00:00:51.780> like<00:00:52.020> raid<00:00:52.260> might<00:00:52.559> also<00:00:52.770> be

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
it's looking like raid might also be

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.790 
it's looking like raid might also be
that<00:00:53.100> map<00:00:53.309> for<00:00:53.520> me<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:54.059> this<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.079> another<00:00:55.350> solo

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
that map for me and this is another solo

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.740 
that map for me and this is another solo
100-plus<00:00:56.489> so<00:00:56.910> it's<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.180> bit<00:00:57.329> different<00:00:57.480> than

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
100-plus so it's a bit different than

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.060 
100-plus so it's a bit different than
Martha<00:00:57.930> three<00:00:58.260> where<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:58.440> used<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.680> always<00:00:58.770> put

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
Martha three where I used to always put

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.580 
Martha three where I used to always put
the<00:00:59.100> full<00:00:59.399> party<00:00:59.760> um<00:01:00.570> in<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:01.260> game<00:01:01.440> looks

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
the full party um in this game looks

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.260 
the full party um in this game looks
like<00:01:01.739> I'm<00:01:01.859> be<00:01:01.980> rolling<00:01:02.250> solo<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:02.699> think<00:01:03.030> most<00:01:03.210> of

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
like I'm be rolling solo I think most of

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.000 
like I'm be rolling solo I think most of
the<00:01:03.359> time<00:01:03.570> some<00:01:03.899> support<00:01:04.409> really<00:01:04.530> is<00:01:04.739> Annie's

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
the time some support really is Annie's

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.060 
the time some support really is Annie's
in<00:01:05.189> this<00:01:05.309> game<00:01:05.519> play<00:01:05.729> in<00:01:05.970> this<00:01:06.780> game<00:01:07.049> I<00:01:07.409> should

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
in this game play in this game I should

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.060 
in this game play in this game I should
say<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:09.110> there's<00:01:10.110> really<00:01:10.229> no<00:01:10.380> point<00:01:10.619> because

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
say and there's really no point because

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.380 
say and there's really no point because
when<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.369> run<00:01:11.520> with<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.700> full<00:01:11.880> party<00:01:12.180> in<00:01:12.270> this

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
when you run with the full party in this

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.240 
when you run with the full party in this
game<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.689> whole<00:01:12.840> other<00:01:12.960> team<00:01:13.260> backs<00:01:13.590> out<00:01:13.799> and

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
game the whole other team backs out and

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.940 
game the whole other team backs out and
you'll<00:01:14.939> be<00:01:15.119> stuck<00:01:15.180> with<00:01:15.780> nine<00:01:15.990> verses<00:01:16.439> too<00:01:16.680> so

when<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.439> was<00:01:37.530> six<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:37.829> three<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.369> believe<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:39.360> was

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
when I was six and three I believe I was

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.569 
when I was six and three I believe I was
like<00:01:39.630> 70<00:01:40.079> at<00:01:40.200> one<00:01:40.409> at<00:01:40.680> one<00:01:41.070> point<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.460> I<00:01:41.520> die

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
like 70 at one at one point and I die

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.389 
like 70 at one at one point and I die
wells<00:01:42.000> in<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.270> lodestar<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:43.049> well<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.530> could<00:01:44.280> try

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
wells in a lodestar so well I could try

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.069 
wells in a lodestar so well I could try
to<00:01:44.490> get<00:01:44.640> 100<00:01:44.939> Katie<00:01:45.149> gameplay<00:01:45.570> I'm<00:01:45.630> sure<00:01:45.810> I'm

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
to get 100 Katie gameplay I'm sure I'm

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.050 
to get 100 Katie gameplay I'm sure I'm
gonna<00:01:46.290> be<00:01:46.380> getting<00:01:46.649> one<00:01:46.979> by<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.670> time<00:01:47.939> Black

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
Ops 2 is over um that is on my list of

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.870 
Ops 2 is over um that is on my list of
things<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:51.090> do<00:01:51.500> but<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:52.560> usually<00:01:53.100> i<00:01:53.520> usually

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
things to do but I usually i usually

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.389 
things to do but I usually i usually
like<00:01:54.119> start<00:01:54.450> out<00:01:54.570> like<00:01:54.689> 15<00:01:55.079> 1<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:55.799> think<00:01:56.219> this<00:01:56.340> is

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
like start out like 15 1 I think this is

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.880 
like start out like 15 1 I think this is
why<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.759> highest<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.450> Katie<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.469> started<00:01:58.829> out

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
why the highest of Katie I started out

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.580 
why the highest of Katie I started out
with<00:01:58.979> around<00:01:59.250> like<00:01:59.369> 75.1<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:01.200> did<00:02:01.380> get

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
with around like 75.1 and I did get

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.440 
with around like 75.1 and I did get
unfortunate<00:02:02.189> that<00:02:02.280> while<00:02:02.490> my<00:02:02.670> lodestar<00:02:03.149> but

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.430 
orbital vsat or blackbird lodestar and
the<00:02:24.580> warship<00:02:24.970> and<00:02:25.180> this<00:02:25.630> is<00:02:25.750> basically<00:02:25.960> this

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
the warship and this is basically this

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.930 
the warship and this is basically this
is<00:02:26.500> just<00:02:26.770> kind<00:02:26.920> of<00:02:26.950> a<00:02:27.040> makeshift<00:02:27.460> setup

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
is just kind of a makeshift setup

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.300 
is just kind of a makeshift setup
because<00:02:28.810> this<00:02:29.230> is<00:02:29.350> what<00:02:29.500> I<00:02:29.530> had<00:02:29.710> available<00:02:29.980> at

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
because this is what I had available at

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.490 
because this is what I had available at
this<00:02:30.520> point<00:02:30.790> in<00:02:30.880> time<00:02:31.060> I<00:02:31.120> was<00:02:31.450> like<00:02:31.570> little<00:02:31.810> 43

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
this point in time I was like little 43

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.650 
this point in time I was like little 43
I<00:02:32.530> believe<00:02:32.920> at<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.910> end<00:02:33.940> of<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.180> game<00:02:34.210> plan<00:02:34.480> no

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
I believe at the end of the game plan no

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.480 
I believe at the end of the game plan no
it<00:02:34.840> was<00:02:34.990> I<00:02:35.170> might<00:02:35.320> have<00:02:35.410> started<00:02:35.590> at<00:02:35.800> level<00:02:36.040> 42

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
it was I might have started at level 42

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.890 
it was I might have started at level 42
in<00:02:36.610> the<00:02:36.640> gameplay<00:02:37.030> so<00:02:37.090> I'd<00:02:37.240> have<00:02:37.270> scavenger

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.990 
in the gameplay so I'd have scavenger
didn't<00:02:38.560> have<00:02:38.680> ghosts<00:02:38.920> and<00:02:39.160> have<00:02:39.280> dogs<00:02:39.550> didn't
