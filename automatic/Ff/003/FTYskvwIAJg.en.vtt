dying a lot by the retro Lancer way more

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.980 
dying a lot by the retro Lancer way more
than<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.250> sawed-off<00:00:26.250> shotgun<00:00:26.990> sawed-off

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
than the sawed-off shotgun sawed-off

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.720 
than the sawed-off shotgun sawed-off
shotgun<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:28.590> not<00:00:28.769> really<00:00:29.099> an<00:00:29.189> issue<00:00:29.310> for<00:00:29.550> me

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
shotgun is not really an issue for me

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.310 
shotgun is not really an issue for me
anymore<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.150> really<00:00:30.359> doesn't<00:00:30.630> bother<00:00:30.660> me<00:00:30.900> it

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
anymore it really doesn't bother me it

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.170 
anymore it really doesn't bother me it
is<00:00:31.980> definitely<00:00:32.189> just<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.550> red<00:00:32.700> shell<00:00:32.880> answer

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
is definitely just a red shell answer

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.670 
is definitely just a red shell answer
because<00:00:33.360> if<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:33.780> have<00:00:33.930> actives<00:00:34.380> with<00:00:34.530> that

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
because if you have actives with that

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.799 
because if you have actives with that
thing<00:00:34.890> even<00:00:35.219> without<00:00:35.309> actives<00:00:36.030> you're<00:00:36.570> down

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
thing even without actives you're down

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.869 
thing even without actives you're down
in<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:37.350> split<00:00:37.710> second<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:39.180> really<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.320> a

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
in a split second and it really is a

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:45.440 
in a split second and it really is a
quite<00:00:41.879> sour<00:00:42.210> if<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.379> do<00:00:43.440> say<00:00:43.770> so<00:00:43.800> myself<00:00:44.450> it

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
quite sour if I do say so myself it

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.450 
quite sour if I do say so myself it
looks<00:00:45.629> like<00:00:47.149> was<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.270> going<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.450> say<00:00:49.219> my<00:00:50.219> figure

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
looks like was it going to say my figure

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.330 
looks like was it going to say my figure
out<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.550> was<00:00:50.700> going<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:50.910> say<00:00:51.030> but<00:00:51.090> when<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:51.719> really

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
out I was going to say but when I really

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.910 
out I was going to say but when I really
get<00:00:53.340> started<00:00:53.789> here<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:53.969> suppose<00:00:54.770> and<00:00:55.770> actually

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
I really like using the hammer burst

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.020 
I really like using the hammer burst
actually<00:00:58.469> uh<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:59.219> use<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.489> iron<00:00:59.640> sights<00:00:59.820> it

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
actually uh to use the iron sights it

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.470 
actually uh to use the iron sights it
actually<00:01:00.270> works<00:01:00.480> out<00:01:00.690> really<00:01:00.989> well<00:01:01.190> and<00:01:02.480> I
