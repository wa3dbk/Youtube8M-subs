00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:07.290
 Further the next report from the cycle is small 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.570
 Russian cities will go to taldom 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.030
 Moscow region center built up 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.139
 merchants houses in the neighborhood dilapidated 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.690
 wooden buildings 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.270
 hard to believe but once in a taldom 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.400
 made shoes for Russia and even 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.980
 France and today's taldom my 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.140
 colleague Vladimir Dementyev at the end 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.180
 nineteenth century taldom was known 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.250
 not only for the whole of Russia but also in Europe 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.320
 speak here came for graceful 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.949
 even Parisian shoes and boots 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.960
 ladies 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.210
 under customs law, you can export 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.940
 there was only one pair to get away though 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.829
 would two girls without regret be thrown away 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.710
 tuff who came from france 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.660
 one pair in the hands of one on the legs however 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.850
 perhaps this is nothing more than a legend 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.829
 but what until the 70s of the last century 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.000
 here almost every home did 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.699
 handmade shoes 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.010
 it is a fact the historical craft has grown in 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.109
 a huge shoe enterprise sometime 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.690
 the Russian shoe factory was running 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.940
 one and a half thousand people are now 300 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.339
 brand store women's shoes from 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.470
 real italian leather parisian 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.659
 fashionista here no longer come but 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.060
 Moscow are often because 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.280
 price of a pair of stylish boots or shoes 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.259
 two times lower than in Moscow from the counters 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.720
 sell production remnants of the past 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.240
 years now the factory has a new customer 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.909
 brand name and leather supplier country 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.100
 trade secret which truth is wrong 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.439
 too easy to hide this Chinese shoes 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.079
 still lower such though 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:36.750
 Now China also has factories which 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:39.420
 live more complicated is this feeling and 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.750
 center by smell and subway skin and by 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.390
 quality of raw materials you come and see 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:50.340
 what shoes in what's here like she 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:52.350
 that's all and smell good dear skin she 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.899
 expensive leather or artificial leather 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.310
 say the quality of the skin is what breaks 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.229
 Italian equipment 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.420
 but business is business shoes from 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.490
 Italian skin is expensive up to a thousand 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.649
 dollars a pair of competition with China is not 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.299
 endures if you go to the piece 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.940
 production needs to reduce staff 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.759
 employees and work in the city and so not 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.420
 will find 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:16.030
 people worried about the fact that almost nowhere 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.180
 youth employment I myself 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:24.819
 Of course, who did it ? 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:28.140
 settle down so here are some small not 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:32.200
 enterprises and not push enterprises 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.989
 so here and wales and in small such 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.940
 institutions c but in taldom a lot 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.920
 Visitors from former Allied countries 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.540
 republics just recently the police 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.030
 conducted a raid on the so-called 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.069
 rubber houses however the problem is such 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:49.049
 raids don't decide one is expelled from 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.049
 others come to take their place 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.720
 today he stay like that 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:57.849
 that anyone can tie in here 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.120
 elementary through the post office 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:04.260
 notify you that he is temporarily arriving at 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.959
 the territory of one or another settlement 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.329
 here and management of FMS and respectively 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.069
 this situation does not affect in principle 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:14.440
 maybe because it is something that is Russian 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.299
 taldom laws this year got into 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.160
 list of cities of historical and cultural 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:19.620
 heritage this means that already in 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.910
 reconstruction will begin next year 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.639
 the city center is supposed 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.599
 organize pedestrian zones here 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:27.900
 to restore trading rows 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:30.669
 and also solve the problem of dilapidated housing 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.530
 Saltykov-Shchedrin street where we are 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:35.440
 now we are on the principle here 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.299
 is entering the city historically 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.650
 prevailing the very first street of the city 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:45.459
 today this street looks like after 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.260
 wars here are of course on this street a lot 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.109
 dilapidated housing and the one that was necessary 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.120
 it was used and save save because 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:54.370
 many houses are monuments of Russian 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.449
 wooden architecture light in the form of 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.000
 napoleon caps 

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:59.919
 carved platbands of such houses are no more 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.959
 Nowhere in Russia say architects 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:03.639
 parallel the city authorities are trying 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.470
 revive folk arts 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:07.900
 there are two specialized 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.079
 educational institutions graduates of which 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.430
 however, also find work hard 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:14.769
 any pottery that 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.470
 made of gli our mond here they are 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:20.229
 the hall is arranged this handiwork 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.079
 it is not a copy it is not to drunk products 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:24.979
 when we take 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:27.879
 work shishkina copy it and work here 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:30.620
 individual work of the artist 

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:33.169
 artist creator, it must be paid 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.150
 as any author's work in the coat of arms 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.069
 city ​​tald encrypted his whole 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.229
 the story here was once strong 

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:40.039
 agriculture and developed shoe 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:41.840
 industry 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:44.389
 the paradox is that it was all in 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.150
 Soviet years and then the coat of arms of the city is not 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:47.719
 there was symbolism appeared in 90 when i 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.610
 shoe 

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:52.909
 and agrarian industry practically 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:55.610
 collapsed while the historic center 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:58.159
 taldom they refurbished count 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.229
 on a large tourist flow of locals 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:02.719
 of course can not in the center of the small on 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:04.879
 cozy city is celebrated by historians of all 

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:07.340
 two centuries ago several times a year 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:09.080
 noisy fair now quietly tourists 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.360
 hurry along the branch of the central street 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:15.520
 Saltykov-Shchedrin to the suburbs is smart and 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.520
 less writer village saved the corner
