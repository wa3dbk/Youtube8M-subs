00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.259
 case it's not going to be enough for a door 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.090
 open but you have to open the 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:27.800
 two the vote has to be unanimous both 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.720

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.590
 press its buttons and the two doors that 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.780
 they have to open so you can 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.120
 enter the conservatory is greater 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.390
 difficulty is greater the requirement but the 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:42.550
 opportunity has it thank you very much 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.550

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:51.629
 then to listen with you ladies 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.629
 and gentlemen an aspiring artist of the year 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:01:03.590
 instead, they abound 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:07.490
 I do not trust now 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:14.400
 it will not give good 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:17.000
 they are just faces of the Caribbean 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.000
 fine 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:26.640
 national study 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.780
 are the zones 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.570
 good 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:02:00.600
 another that tunnel 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:02:00.600
 well you will not see I think I do not like it 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:16.160
 it was not late 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:16.160
 that's why face to face baby 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.049
 d 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:37.390
 thank you very much have a door 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.959
 mikko opened the door for you but not the 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.610
 opened nacha so the income is not going to 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.400
 be able to be in this opportunity but let's go 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:48.000
 to listen because to vernazza because not 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.180
 I see nothing original 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.430
 even if it's something a little light because 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.160
 I have a trained eye to see more 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.590
 fine the best that someone else is not 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:02.610
 no merit 47 years ago that I do this 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:05.940
 but I did not see anything original and for me 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.970
 frankly do such an agressed thing 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.280
 This takes me to me because the gringos 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.959
 they do better let's do what we do 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.300
 we 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.100
 that year guys though if you opened it 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.280
 the door I liked I liked the energy 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.930
 I'm not afraid of them being made 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.700
 gringas things let's say good specialist 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.690
 that does everything a little because if not 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.340
 we would be being a festival of 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:31.100
 folklore and I do not know if up close is not that 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:34.560
 what I say but if michael jackson 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:37.080
 michael jackson who does it better me 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.820
 it seemed that it started very high that I had 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.890
 possibilities but he had to 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.890
 enter unanimously and I did not get it 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:47.450
 good 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.130
 sabbatical they have cynical because a 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.140
 door opened is very important this 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.380
 opinion you also arrived here 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.900
 I mean since any is this 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:00.290
 first thank you for the opportunity to 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.750
 be here for me to cassez many extras 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.540
 and this project to the call for 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:08.620
 people that there were 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.840
 good is a door that closes I come 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:14.790
 from cordoba very far 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.790
 many and that 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.890
 by not having the pp wants so to continue 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:27.290
 fighting for that if they do not have much 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.210
 energy and you have to feel it here in the 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.880
 stage 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.289
 He was our first aspiring artist 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.120
 could assign one of the vacancies that 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:38.500
 they stay in the conservatory but it's not going to 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.500
 to do is we have a second applicant
