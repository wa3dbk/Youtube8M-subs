we're<00:01:27.860> going<00:01:28.100> to<00:01:28.280> loosen<00:01:28.790> the<00:01:29.060> hose<00:01:29.270> clamp<00:01:29.659> on

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
we're going to loosen the hose clamp on

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.080 
we're going to loosen the hose clamp on
the<00:01:29.900> back<00:01:30.200> of<00:01:30.409> the<00:01:30.530> carburetor<00:01:30.890> this<00:01:31.820> hose

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
the back of the carburetor this hose

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.940 
the back of the carburetor this hose
clamp<00:01:32.420> holds<00:01:32.840> the<00:01:33.020> air<00:01:33.320> boot<00:01:33.590> to<00:01:33.830> the

clamp holds the air boot to the

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.260 
clamp holds the air boot to the
carburetor<00:01:35.680> once<00:01:36.680> that's<00:01:36.979> loose<00:01:37.370> we're<00:01:37.940> going

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
carburetor once that's loose we're going

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.380 
carburetor once that's loose we're going
to<00:01:38.479> remove<00:01:39.110> the<00:01:39.350> silencer<00:01:40.070> and<00:01:41.030> the<00:01:41.119> reason

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
to remove the silencer and the reason

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.270 
to remove the silencer and the reason
we're<00:01:41.510> removing<00:01:41.960> the<00:01:42.470> silencer<00:01:43.010> and

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
we're removing the silencer and

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.520 
we're removing the silencer and
loosening<00:01:43.670> the<00:01:43.790> boot<00:01:43.970> on<00:01:44.150> the<00:01:44.390> carburetor<00:01:45.229> so

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
loosening the boot on the carburetor so

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.930 
loosening the boot on the carburetor so
we<00:01:45.619> kind<00:01:45.830> of<00:01:45.890> get<00:01:45.950> the<00:01:46.100> subframe<00:01:46.520> out<00:01:46.760> of<00:01:46.880> the

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
we kind of get the subframe out of the

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.240 
we kind of get the subframe out of the
way<00:01:47.060> so<00:01:47.170> getting<00:01:48.170> these<00:01:48.380> two<00:01:48.799> things<00:01:49.070> out<00:01:49.220> of

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
way so getting these two things out of

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.550 
way so getting these two things out of
the<00:01:49.400> way<00:01:49.520> makes<00:01:49.790> that<00:01:49.970> a<00:01:50.000> lot<00:01:50.210> easier<00:01:50.320> once<00:01:51.320> the

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
the way makes that a lot easier once the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.440 
the way makes that a lot easier once the
silencers<00:01:52.100> off<00:01:52.280> we're<00:01:52.610> going<00:01:52.760> to<00:01:52.880> loosen<00:01:53.090> the

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
silencers off we're going to loosen the

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.500 
silencers off we're going to loosen the
lower<00:01:53.600> subframe<00:01:54.380> bolts<00:01:54.799> and<00:01:55.330> then<00:01:56.330> we're

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
lower subframe bolts and then we're

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.870 
lower subframe bolts and then we're
going<00:01:56.780> to<00:01:56.890> completely<00:01:57.890> remove<00:01:58.340> the<00:01:58.640> upper

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
going to completely remove the upper

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
bolts are out of the way we're going to

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.440 
bolts are out of the way we're going to
let<00:02:05.990> the<00:02:06.170> subframe<00:02:06.590> drop<00:02:07.070> back<00:02:07.400> which<00:02:08.269> is

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.550 
side install the spacer and the nut once
that's<00:04:05.000> on<00:04:05.239> you're<00:04:05.540> going<00:04:05.630> to<00:04:05.720> torque<00:04:06.110> the<00:04:06.320> nut

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
that's on you're going to torque the nut

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.490 
that's on you're going to torque the nut
to<00:04:07.220> 33<00:04:07.910> foot-pounds<00:04:08.600> you<00:04:08.870> may<00:04:09.050> need<00:04:09.200> to<00:04:09.320> go<00:04:09.470> a

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
to 33 foot-pounds you may need to go a

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.140 
to 33 foot-pounds you may need to go a
little<00:04:09.890> more<00:04:10.070> than<00:04:10.220> that<00:04:10.400> especially<00:04:10.910> if<00:04:11.030> you

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
little more than that especially if you

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.240 
little more than that especially if you
have<00:04:11.330> a<00:04:11.360> gap<00:04:11.870> in<00:04:12.200> between<00:04:12.230> the<00:04:12.739> subframe<00:04:13.220> and

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
have a gap in between the subframe and

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:19.690 
have a gap in between the subframe and
frame<00:04:16.780> once<00:04:17.780> that's<00:04:18.049> tight<00:04:18.440> we<00:04:18.830> can<00:04:19.160> replace

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
frame once that's tight we can replace

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.170 
frame once that's tight we can replace
the<00:04:20.030> lower<00:04:20.239> subframe<00:04:20.840> bolt<00:04:21.880> so<00:04:22.880> we'll<00:04:23.030> go

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
the lower subframe bolt so we'll go

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.970 
the lower subframe bolt so we'll go
ahead<00:04:23.419> and<00:04:23.600> remove<00:04:23.750> the<00:04:24.080> stock<00:04:24.380> subframe

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 
ahead and remove the stock subframe

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.460 
ahead and remove the stock subframe
bolts<00:04:25.370> and<00:04:25.550> as<00:04:26.360> you<00:04:26.480> can<00:04:26.630> see<00:04:26.870> looking<00:04:27.230> at<00:04:27.380> the

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
bolts and as you can see looking at the

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.500 
bolts and as you can see looking at the
stock<00:04:27.770> subframe<00:04:28.340> bolt<00:04:28.610> it<00:04:28.820> already<00:04:29.150> shows<00:04:29.479> a

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
stock subframe bolt it already shows a

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.830 
stock subframe bolt it already shows a
lot<00:04:29.930> of<00:04:29.960> wear<00:04:30.380> on<00:04:30.410> it

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
lot of wear on it

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.900 
lot of wear on it
we're<00:04:32.560> going<00:04:32.800> to<00:04:32.919> apply<00:04:33.370> a<00:04:33.400> little<00:04:33.669> bit<00:04:33.790> of

we're going to apply a little bit of

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.879 
we're going to apply a little bit of
threadlocker<00:04:34.540> to<00:04:34.840> the<00:04:34.960> new<00:04:35.139> bolt<00:04:35.440> and<00:04:35.650> install

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:35.889

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
once it's in we're going to tighten it

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.610 
once it's in we're going to tighten it
up<00:04:42.310> to<00:04:42.460> 18<00:04:43.000> foot<00:04:43.270> pounds<00:04:43.810> and<00:04:43.960> we're<00:04:44.260> good<00:04:44.470> to
