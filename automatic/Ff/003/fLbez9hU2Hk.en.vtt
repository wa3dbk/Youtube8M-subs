00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.280
 from the web 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.820

 as the lady of the 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:48.120
 special technique that I have 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:52.200

 the container that we have 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:02.430
 therefore to maneuver in we will return to 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:04.470
 make a good race that we do before 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:09.679

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:12.360
 common in a little 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.709
 clear because it hit me from the water planting 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:19.110

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.420
 I have been a baker for many years 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.050
 but something is not often given to us 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:29.160
 fear of the way if you lose a 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:31.739
 little hand but not for there we go 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.130

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:39.569
 good flour 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:43.610
 the next step of stretching the 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.610
 mass co reform or without success 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.520

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:00.640
