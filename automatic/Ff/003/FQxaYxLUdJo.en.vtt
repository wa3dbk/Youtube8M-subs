00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
embryologically those testicles start to

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.749 
embryologically those testicles start to
migrate<00:01:46.609> down<00:01:47.179> through<00:01:47.749> the<00:01:47.990> abdomen<00:01:48.530> in<00:01:48.979> at

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
migrate down through the abdomen in at

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.080 
migrate down through the abdomen in at
or<00:01:50.210> about<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:50.719> time<00:01:50.749> puppies<00:01:51.469> are<00:01:51.649> born<00:01:52.090> those

or about the time puppies are born those

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.069 
or about the time puppies are born those
testicles<00:01:53.749> pop<00:01:54.259> through<00:01:54.770> a<00:01:54.979> ring<00:01:55.899> called<00:01:56.899> the

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 
testicles pop through a ring called the

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:00.609 
testicles pop through a ring called the
inguinal<00:01:57.530> ring<00:01:57.829> in<00:01:58.609> the<00:01:58.909> abdomen<00:01:59.569> and<00:01:59.780> drop

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
inguinal ring in the abdomen and drop

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:06.360 
inguinal ring in the abdomen and drop
into<00:02:01.399> the<00:02:01.789> testicle<00:02:02.630> in<00:02:03.549> cryptorchidism<00:02:04.549> is

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
into the testicle in cryptorchidism is

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:12.790 
into the testicle in cryptorchidism is
Krypt<00:02:07.370> means<00:02:07.910> hidden<00:02:09.610> orchid<00:02:10.610> is<00:02:11.800> testicle

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
Krypt means hidden orchid is testicle

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.360 
Krypt means hidden orchid is testicle
and<00:02:13.040> so<00:02:13.610> cryptorchid<00:02:14.510> is<00:02:14.840> a<00:02:14.870> hidden<00:02:15.350> testicle

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
and so cryptorchid is a hidden testicle

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.400 
and so cryptorchid is a hidden testicle
the<00:02:16.730> reason<00:02:17.090> it's<00:02:17.240> hidden<00:02:17.510> is<00:02:17.870> because<00:02:18.260> it

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
the reason it's hidden is because it

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.520 
the reason it's hidden is because it
hasn't<00:02:18.590> made<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.190> whole<00:02:19.400> trip<00:02:19.660> from<00:02:20.660> up<00:02:21.170> near

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
hasn't made the whole trip from up near

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.050 
hasn't made the whole trip from up near
the<00:02:21.680> kidneys<00:02:22.130> into<00:02:22.820> the<00:02:23.000> scrotum<00:02:23.540> and<00:02:24.850> this<00:02:25.850> is

the kidneys into the scrotum and this is

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.190 
the kidneys into the scrotum and this is

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.640 
and that makes a big difference
surgically<00:04:27.470> because<00:04:28.100> a<00:04:28.850> male<00:04:29.810> dog<00:04:30.139> that<00:04:30.440> has<00:04:30.620> a

intra-abdominal testicle

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.629 
intra-abdominal testicle
it's<00:04:35.900> almost<00:04:36.620> like<00:04:36.919> doing<00:04:37.190> a<00:04:38.620> canine<00:04:39.620> stay<00:04:40.280> on

it's almost like doing a canine stay on
that<00:04:40.880> side<00:04:41.300> because<00:04:42.110> you're<00:04:42.230> going<00:04:42.380> into<00:04:42.710> the

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
abdomen to remove that testicle so just

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.020 
abdomen to remove that testicle so just
want<00:04:48.080> to<00:04:48.139> give<00:04:48.260> you<00:04:48.290> a<00:04:48.380> little<00:04:48.530> information<00:04:49.030> we
