00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.500
 until now the caregivers and 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.540
 is little appreciated for their 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.889
 availability their listening to the sick in 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.720
 saw in her dedicated people 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:19.940
 but devolved to household chores 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.280
 times change lack of staff 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.050
 lack of new generation means 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.970
 the hospital are beginning to recognize the 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.859
 skills of these caregivers 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.970
 important role for patients, but 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:29.390
 also in the operation of a 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.550
 service 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:35.260
 we went to the tenon hospital where 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.260
 this recognition pays off 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:44.880
 gynecological surgery service 7 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.470
 morning hours hello was aurélie 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.140
 the caregiver this morning is fine 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:52.350
 so I take the temperature in 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.970
 the ear like every morning aurélie 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.560
 takes the constants and transmits them to 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.730
 jeanne the nurse with whom she does 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:01.560
 team it's perfect aurélie is help 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.760
 caregiver for eight years she loves her 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.800
 work in this service that she has 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.440
 joined a year ago she feels close 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.110
 women they accompany try 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.840
 to wake them gently because 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.360
 already sleep in the hospital it's not 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.720
 obvious so if in addition we come back as 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.370
 brutes in the rooms and then ball 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.990
 in China and know how to know 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.430
 it's the day for the tension she 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.230
 young people are already trying their hand 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.220
 and then already being the ear for 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.780
 to take the temperature 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.610
 but sometimes they have a little trouble 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.460
 emerge anyway it makes sense that if 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.290
 will not eat anything the tandem is solidarity 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.210
 with the revaluation of the status 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.830
 care assistant first tasks 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:45.320
 hygiene and care that are now 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:45.320
 shared with the nurse céline and 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:52.640
 after there are the nurses 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.890
 surf after the first round in general 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.320
 it's series no 1 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.630
 hello hello wolf since I can 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:03.980

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.140
 gemal below does so under the effect 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.610
 autumn 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:28.280
 excuse me no no it does not matter you 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:30.020
 do not worry too much but right 1 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.880
 joel was operated on a cancer of 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.830
 the endometrium ie the tissue of 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.030
 the uterus but his overweight graph 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.340
 make it difficult to convalesce 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.890
 morphine has made its effect and the team 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.600
 began to wash but with a 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.950
 painful patient her care 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:51.200
 elementary requires a lot 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:53.090
 accompaniment would have linked jeanne but 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.200
 joey the contribution you do not need 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.550
 give her the impression that she is 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.340
 totally dependent 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.959
 it's important for morale I 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.140
 iron with soap 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.850

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:11.410

 go wash my belly an agreement 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:20.060
 the real little oven but I'm fine 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.980
 was doing here a difficult to manage the 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.690
 joel pains while performing the 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:30.220
 toilet and care you have to go fast 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:30.220

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:38.690
 but we're bothering you're gonna do bah yes 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.190
 I know it's also an opportunity to 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.770
 make an inventory of his body in 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.690
 suffering the carers must 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:54.500
 spot pressure ulcers or any small 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:04:02.150
 injury likely to degenerate into 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:03.900
 what does it make us a doctor that gives that 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:09.140
 on a roof 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:11.939
 tasks go courage 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:16.590
 Well we'll give you us

 ours is full, we bring some 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.810
 toilet and care will have lasted 20 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.549
 minutes 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.620
 it's time for aurélie to serve a 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.970
 day her breakfast is 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:30.570
 always coffee latte madam says yeah 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:32.190
 well I come back the fact that others 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.289
 people take care of your toilets 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:38.370
 find you what are the gestures 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:40.260
 just precise that my wife and I are 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:45.090
 more than me because we could not get there 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:48.510
 not and when one is a little deficit of 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.370
 Courage is what it brings to you 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.530
 help at these times a lot 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.000
 Verry much 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:58.680
 it's amazing all so 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.800
 funds directed us I brought you back 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.539
 a towel to contribute to well-being 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.160
 patients translates into a load 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:06.599
 very important work for the 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.120
 caregivers who are also 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:11.010
 indispensable for the care 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:14.789
 their long underrated role is 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:16.349
 today more and more recognized the 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:17.180
 role of the nursing assistant in a service 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:18.919
 he is 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:22.400
 and not primordial because all 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:24.889
 actors are really indispensable in 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.990
 done it's a work of equipped are 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:28.880
 nurse caregivers who does not want 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.750
 not work but the opposite is 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.970
 true too 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.949
 without a nurse's aide the nurse this 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:36.080
 would really be overwhelmed and he would not 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:39.830
 maybe not the time to realize all 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:45.050
 the care she has to take care of 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:47.870
 it would not be possible to stay clean 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.730
 hygiene not the most interesting well 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:53.390
 sure but a necessity that she assumes 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:58.240
 I quietly not saying you 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:58.240
 fairs by a little tired good it takes 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:05.630
 the essential for her is the team 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:08.960
 that she trains with the nurse there is 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:12.740
 pathologies that I discover all 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:14.410
 the days that surprise me 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.720
 I did not think it existed but 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:19.990
 yeah but we learn a lot especially 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:23.050
 precisely because nurses tell us 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.699
 take to show the bandages 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:27.669
 finally how do we do everything from 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:29.379
 blow we see a lot of things in this 

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:31.270
 service that also treats cancer from 

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:33.490
 the uterus or breast the patients 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.080
 goes through very difficult times and 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.940
 often find comfort with 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.250
 caregivers closest to her 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.560
 on a daily basis we do not treat 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:43.319
 physical pain is treated 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:45.699
 mainly to the cinema moral pain 

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:48.879
 because and in addition we are in service 

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:53.020
 where there are so many women and 

00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:55.360
 being women we understand even more what 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:58.240
 what happens to them and that's true 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.750
 it's not obvious it's not obvious 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.520
 suffers 

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:01.900
 but never intrusive helps 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.909
 caregivers know how to identify farms in 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.710
 suffering we will wait for it to launch 

00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:08.110
 the fuji and I will say in quotation marks 

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:12.370
 to be able after we were talking with 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:16.330
 she and then bah when we do the 

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:17.530
 caregivers or nurses not 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.930
 do not have the right words but do not arrive 

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:21.879
 not to enter the communication but 

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:25.270
 a psychologist also who is there so we 

00:07:21.879 --> 00:07:27.069
 can suggest to men to have 14h 

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:29.050
 aurelie standing for five hours from 

00:07:27.069 --> 00:07:30.880
 morning soon finished his service but 

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:32.380
 not his day more than an hour of 

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:36.569
 transport before starting his second 

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:36.569
 mothers day this time
