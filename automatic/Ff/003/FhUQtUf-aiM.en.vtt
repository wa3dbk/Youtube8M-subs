00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
they do have the evidence to prove that

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.310

background<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.079> second<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.590> avatar

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
background and the second of the avatar

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.130 
background and the second of the avatar
now<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.730> both<00:00:53.910> pictures<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.629> mascot<00:00:55.020> is

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
now in both pictures the mascot is

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.869 
now in both pictures the mascot is
actually<00:00:55.469> wearing<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.949> beta<00:00:56.219> hat<00:00:56.460> which<00:00:56.730> is

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
actually wearing a beta hat which is

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.189 
actually wearing a beta hat which is
kind<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.180> intriguing<00:00:57.449> because<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.050> means

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
kind of intriguing because that means

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.389 
kind of intriguing because that means
that<00:00:58.379> he<00:00:58.500> must<00:00:58.680> have<00:00:58.770> been<00:00:58.890> around<00:00:59.100> since<00:00:59.219> the

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
that he must have been around since the

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.189 
that he must have been around since the
start<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.730> full<00:00:59.910> penguin<00:01:00.300> which<00:01:00.660> means<00:01:00.989> that

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
start a full penguin which means that

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.840 
start a full penguin which means that
this<00:01:01.350> mascot<00:01:01.770> has<00:01:01.920> been<00:01:02.129> around<00:01:02.370> since<00:01:02.730> the

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
this mascot has been around since the

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.240 
this mascot has been around since the
beginning<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.510> clapping<00:01:03.780> now<00:01:04.500> this<00:01:04.769> brings<00:01:04.979> up

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
beginning of clapping now this brings up

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.310 
beginning of clapping now this brings up
the<00:01:05.280> question<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.880> where<00:01:06.420> has<00:01:06.689> his<00:01:06.840> mascot

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
the question of where has his mascot

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.630 
the question of where has his mascot
been<00:01:07.619> where<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.010> he<00:01:08.130> been<00:01:08.280> hiding

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
been where is he been hiding

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.980 
been where is he been hiding
now<00:01:08.970> one<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.299> theories<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.780> actually

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
now one of the theories that I actually

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.539 
now one of the theories that I actually
really<00:01:10.470> did<00:01:10.650> like<00:01:10.860> hunting<00:01:11.159> when<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.340> Bligh's

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
really did like hunting when the Bligh's

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.190 
really did like hunting when the Bligh's
that<00:01:11.700> I<00:01:11.760> was<00:01:11.880> really<00:01:12.119> is<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:12.630> he<00:01:12.720> leaves<00:01:13.020> on

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
that I was really is that he leaves on

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.719 
that I was really is that he leaves on
the<00:01:13.320> side<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.890> mountain<00:01:14.070> in<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.490> cave

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
the side of the mountain in the cave

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.850 
the side of the mountain in the cave
that<00:01:14.909> were<00:01:15.030> always<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:15.540> curious<00:01:16.049> about<00:01:16.140> other

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
that were always so curious about other

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.990 
that were always so curious about other
than<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.400> really<00:01:17.430> have<00:01:17.790> no<00:01:17.970> other

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
than that I really have no other

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.420 
than that I really have no other
information<00:01:18.750> about<00:01:18.990> this<00:01:19.350> mascot<00:01:19.770> now<00:01:19.979> the

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.219 
maybe now I'm hoping that we'll see this
mascot<00:01:31.880> in<00:01:32.180> the<00:01:32.360> frozen<00:01:32.690> party<00:01:32.960> but<00:01:33.110> I<00:01:33.140> really

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
mascot in the frozen party but I really

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:34.750 
mascot in the frozen party but I really
doubt<00:01:33.620> that<00:01:33.680> because<00:01:34.040> Club<00:01:34.250> Penguin<00:01:34.490> hasn't

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 
doubt that because Club Penguin hasn't

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.180 
doubt that because Club Penguin hasn't
been<00:01:34.880> pushing<00:01:35.270> any<00:01:35.510> sort<00:01:35.960> of<00:01:36.170> leads<00:01:36.500> or<00:01:36.830> hints

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
been pushing any sort of leads or hints

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.160 
been pushing any sort of leads or hints
or<00:01:37.310> Evans<00:01:37.640> that<00:01:38.090> he<00:01:38.270> will<00:01:38.479> be<00:01:38.630> in<00:01:38.780> the<00:01:38.869> frozen

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
or Evans that he will be in the frozen

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.200 
or Evans that he will be in the frozen
party<00:01:39.440> so<00:01:39.560> as<00:01:39.710> of<00:01:39.860> right<00:01:40.010> now<00:01:40.070> we<00:01:40.250> have<00:01:40.520> no<00:01:40.729> idea
