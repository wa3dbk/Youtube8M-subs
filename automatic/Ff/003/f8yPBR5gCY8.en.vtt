roads in March so it's a gamble
very<00:01:17.070> often<00:01:17.280> there's<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.729> lot<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:18.119> snow<00:01:18.659> up<00:01:18.690> here

snow off road sections even though

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.150 
snow off road sections even though
normally<00:03:46.990> they<00:03:47.110> take<00:03:47.140> plows<00:03:47.560> through<00:03:47.830> here

normally they take plows through here
there<00:03:48.640> are<00:03:48.910> very<00:03:49.150> often<00:03:49.630> sections<00:03:50.200> which<00:03:50.500> are

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
there are very often sections which are

there are very often sections which are
smooth<00:03:51.850> enough<00:03:52.090> we<00:03:52.330> can<00:03:52.540> get<00:03:52.660> the<00:03:52.810> car<00:03:53.050> up<00:03:53.260> and

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
smooth enough we can get the car up and

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.930 
smooth enough we can get the car up and
over<00:03:53.650> into<00:03:53.800> one<00:03:54.040> of<00:03:54.130> the<00:03:54.190> snow<00:03:54.400> roads<00:03:56.130> why<00:03:57.130> this

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:10.900 

I<00:04:03.890> think<00:04:04.700> it<00:04:04.790> might<00:04:04.940> be<00:04:04.970> a<00:04:05.120> little<00:04:05.360> high<00:04:09.910> will

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
I think it might be a little high will

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.160 
I think it might be a little high will
at<00:04:11.000> least<00:04:11.090> give<00:04:11.330> you<00:04:11.360> a<00:04:11.450> very<00:04:11.690> good<00:04:11.900> job<00:04:12.020> of

gonna go ahead and just roll with it and
see<00:04:30.890> if<00:04:30.950> we<00:04:31.040> can<00:04:31.130> get<00:04:31.220> it<00:04:31.310> unstuck<00:04:31.490> because<00:04:32.420> if

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
see if we can get it unstuck because if

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.630 
see if we can get it unstuck because if
not<00:04:32.660> we're<00:04:33.080> all<00:04:33.170> gonna<00:04:33.260> die<00:04:33.500> out<00:04:33.740> here<00:04:33.800> in<00:04:34.220> the
