00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.480
 we will feel like 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.400
 players they have no pressure but 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.469
 something positive because he gets 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.059
 would tidy up that we see there like that before 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:17.860
 a great Algerian people with a whole 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.439
 idea that can only be positive in 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.330
 cooking is rather happy then 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:29.500
 so it's a rather positive presence 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:31.899
 and should you simply are 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.079
 a new and several new 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:36.430
 unknown a little responsibility 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.260
 extra compared to others 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.420
 when you feel besco quality 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:49.149
 since we are waiting for you all good 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:52.079
 it must do all that you do not have 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:52.079
 afraid of this first outing 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:01:01.220
 It's okay 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.220
 7 allen covage 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.730
 but never for all my friends it was 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.680
 always done i'm always like that 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:16.430
 then here I am, I think that maxim 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:18.230
 do you have a guarantee I 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.370
 do not know what exactly is its end 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.500
 to the rumors that say the executioners 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.120
 of the veil negotiate directly their 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.030
 pathetic and there before becoming because 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:28.160
 that it happened with you no 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.710
 honestly me that's not at all me 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.750
 that's how I do not think I thee 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.890
 like all coaches would ask 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.810
 to achieve this stuff because 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.430
 here they do their team and we 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.350
 I'm here to give Algeria no 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.150
 you receive white Cholet 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.310
 andrÃ© early to blow it took 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.960
 the rest I ask management because the 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.160
 national coach did not have to repeat that 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.710
 at each act each output we go 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.420
 still your reaction to 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.810
 the statement of the former coach 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.060
 Tunisian trabi website who said that the 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.010
 Tunisian federation gave us 100 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.540
 thousand euros and you preferred to manage 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.540
 in relation to money money 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.920
 what it touches you in the tent 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:19.010
 this is where it touches us to the fact that 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.690
 do not touch me because it's 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.550
 not at all the case so 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.630
 it's because he said to himself 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.580
 this is the media world or we have a 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.750
 little bit I play for pleasure 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:35.720
 time 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:39.830
 still practice that he remains very proud 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.760
 could not have recused himself for a 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:57.190
 friendly game 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:57.190
 the next previous concerts 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:07.270
 reminders of your qualification visit 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.640
 is always in touch with them 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:12.190
 we had not decided yet we had 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.040
 asked Tunisian officials to 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.980
 come to italy to give them your 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:24.270
 opinion is what you confirm the end 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:24.270
 I was with well before its terraces 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:37.930

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:42.240

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.240
 I like entourage who may have you 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.800
 before any personal financial 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.700
 after I was already happy in his 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.410
 new way for a little so that everything 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:58.010
 the context that could see her turn me 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:04:00.620
 it's sure we're talking 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.329
 the outside what may have missed ago 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.209
 problems at the selection level 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:14.870

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.580
 new like that to become in his 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.800
 selections had three apartments 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.000
 by the locals and yes the people very 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.340
 frankly told me a lot about people 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.060
 especially in France of Algerian a 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.990
 children's choir 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.880

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.410
 amount of quebec everyone is here 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.520

00:04:51.410 --> 00:05:04.940
 am new death announced to do 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:05:09.919
 the effort as a complete player you 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:13.660
 plan to describe how you play 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:16.099
 how do you play a lot of people 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.440
 doing a realism when I jump a 

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:20.030
 game is a maximum here I do not want 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:24.229
 so my little bit very combative 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:25.729
 assaulted his insults combative jets is 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:26.580
 the ceo table after tomorrow I the bench of 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:28.470
 his to play 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.759
 play the others by by a very game 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.129
 simple truth of it has 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:34.560
 qualities and flaws that it becomes 

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:36.569
 seriousness has the qualities and faults there are 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.729
 a lot to all that you'll see it through 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:39.900
 you each have his own idea but 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:41.550
 I always try to work at 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.960
 training on both times more often 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.020
 concerning the payment of 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:49.080
 collected a specific job in these 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:51.539
 two days to count see for the 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.979
 first time as a holder against 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:55.139
 works every day the group is there 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:57.090
 no specific work for each 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:59.039
 player then we get to the middle 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.500
 runner with real what's there a 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:03.780
 work that is done in my ya nothing had 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.129
 particular what is done is 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.960
 many the field could the players 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:09.090
 so we are here to help the selection 

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.620
 then we will see for the future 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.110
 and concerning the balance sheet team 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:16.319
 what are you preparing for 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:18.779
 this meeting he the first selection 

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:19.770
 African that you offer now I 

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:21.389
 do not know the ones that come to me 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.440
 share two three players 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:24.870
 then we know it's going to be a match 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.789
 very difficult when you see them in 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.110
 Africa and it's me especially big for 

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:29.969
 the world cup there can also be at 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:32.190
 heart to make a result but we at the 

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:35.520
 home we are at home here we must 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:37.409
 to have a good match there but 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.969
 only when you find them you 

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:41.860
 invite review group after 

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:43.779
 the bad life the world the bad ones 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.789
 traffic results 

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:47.699
 does it think it did not affect 

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:49.629
 vista on the psychology of the group 

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:51.099
 no me I think like me I'm going 

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:56.429
 happen to charles and now they have 

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:58.779
 not spoken I think that having 

00:06:56.429 --> 00:07:01.329
 acted the group sa has advanced 

00:06:58.779 --> 00:07:03.629
 some players a little experience 

00:07:01.329 --> 00:07:06.509
 it can only other games positive and 

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:08.979
 even if they see there the elimination 

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:15.209
 but I think that with his ison they have 

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:15.209
 progressed thinking
