00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.149
 This video will talk about how 

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:03.800
 install plugin guitar rig 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.530
 directly into the Fl Studio program 

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:07.730
 for this 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:13.389
 You go to the file manager 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:15.679
 go to drive C choose 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:18.400
 program files find folder 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.569
 Nativ instruments 

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:25.989
 there are two folders VST plugins 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:28.480
 32 and 64 bit 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.410
 for Fl Studio we need 32 bit 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.890
 these folders may not be 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.210
 if you are installing 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.770
 the very installation of the program Guitar rig 5 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.840
 did not indicate the first tick if you have data 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.050
 no plugins here you just have to 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.570
 reinstall the guitar rig program itself 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.310
 and be sure when installing Guitar rig 5, specify 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.130
 ticks that you also need 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.240
 plug-in libraries 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.440
 we copy this library 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.100
 Now go to the folder 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.890
 directly where you are installed 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.610
 Fl Studio program find the plugins folder 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.310
 VST 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.930
 straight without opening it, we insert into this 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.440
 folder we copied file 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.570
 Guitar rig5.dll libraries 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.190
 I already have it there so I will replace it 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.930
 now when opening now 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.890
 I already have a Guitar rig5.dll plugin, here it is 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.980
 Further we open the program Fl Studio 11 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.930
 call the mixer 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.890
 on the mixer, select any channel channel 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.110
 to which we will send a signal with 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.280
 our guitar 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.920
 here choose the entrance of our guitar 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.810
 For example, this is the entry for my guitar. 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.470
 for my sound card 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.090
 I click this triangle click here 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.760
 on this tab MORE 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.170
 quick scan will do 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.760
 and look 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.480
 with fast scanning you 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.340
 the new plugin will be highlighted in red 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:05.920
 if this is your first time 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.459
 only the name will be Guitar rig 5 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.419
 that's how it will look 

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:12.009
 Guitar rig 5 will be red 

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:14.809
 Click here on this place on the square 

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:16.689
 letter F 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:19.199
 so that next time you have 

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:20.159
 was already 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:22.469
 when you click on the whole triangle 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:24.689
 list of plugins you need 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:26.349
 so that they appear list 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.299
 this letter F is pressed 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.790
 and vice versa if the letter F is pressed 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.479
 then in the list Guitar rig 5 will not 

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:35.359
 still push the letter F 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:38.239
 Push directly 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.329
 now we have a Guitar rig5 plugin 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:42.939
 and we can already work with him here
