00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.399 
a lot of their shin guards and elbow
pads<00:01:59.299> so<00:02:00.299> it's<00:02:00.419> very<00:02:00.509> stretchable<00:02:00.929> and

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
pads so it's very stretchable and

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.649

of x60 adaptive core pad starting up at
the<00:02:10.770> top<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.520> have<00:02:11.550> your<00:02:11.850> spine<00:02:12.090> protection

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
the top you have your spine protection

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.720 
the top you have your spine protection
which<00:02:13.050> you're<00:02:13.200> using<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:14.010> high<00:02:14.160> end<00:02:14.430> vent

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
which you're using the the high end vent

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.470 
which you're using the the high end vent
armor<00:02:15.120> composite<00:02:15.690> like<00:02:15.870> on<00:02:16.050> the

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
armor composite like on the

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.750 
armor composite like on the
sixteen<00:02:16.959> and<00:02:17.170> forty<00:02:17.530> pants<00:02:17.890> so<00:02:18.400> what<00:02:18.610> the

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
sixteen and forty pants so what the

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.670 
sixteen and forty pants so what the
composite<00:02:19.569> material<00:02:19.900> is<00:02:19.989> is<00:02:20.170> this<00:02:20.319> basically

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
composite material is is this basically

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.670 
composite material is is this basically
a<00:02:20.950> foam<00:02:21.580> and<00:02:21.909> plastic<00:02:22.330> molded<00:02:23.140> together<00:02:23.260> in<00:02:23.590> a

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
a foam and plastic molded together in a

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.860 
a foam and plastic molded together in a
honeycomb<00:02:23.980> shape<00:02:24.519> so<00:02:25.030> it<00:02:25.120> offers<00:02:25.420> a<00:02:25.450> high

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
honeycomb shape so it offers a high

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.660 
honeycomb shape so it offers a high
level<00:02:26.080> protection<00:02:26.319> but<00:02:26.709> it's<00:02:26.830> 25%<00:02:27.519> lighter

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
level protection but it's 25% lighter

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.729 
level protection but it's 25% lighter
lighter<00:02:28.420> than<00:02:28.840> the<00:02:28.959> traditional<00:02:29.349> set<00:02:29.560> up<00:02:29.650> or

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
lighter than the traditional set up or

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.500 
lighter than the traditional set up or
just<00:02:29.950> using<00:02:30.099> poly<00:02:30.459> a<00:02:30.580> foam<00:02:30.819> layering<00:02:31.299> system

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
just using poly a foam layering system

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.960 
just using poly a foam layering system
so<00:02:32.230> nice<00:02:32.409> to<00:02:32.560> see<00:02:32.709> that<00:02:32.739> up<00:02:33.010> there<00:02:33.040> it's<00:02:33.700> also

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
so nice to see that up there it's also

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.270 
so nice to see that up there it's also
adjustable<00:02:34.629> these<00:02:35.530> it's<00:02:35.799> attached<00:02:36.160> with

adjustable these it's attached with
elastic<00:02:36.879> straps<00:02:37.239> here<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:37.870> then<00:02:38.500> it<00:02:38.590> comes

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
elastic straps here and then it comes

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.039 
elastic straps here and then it comes
out<00:02:38.950> here<00:02:39.400> so<00:02:39.819> you<00:02:39.879> can<00:02:40.030> tighten<00:02:40.780> it<00:02:40.810> through

out here so you can tighten it through
this<00:02:41.170> velcro<00:02:41.680> to<00:02:42.040> make<00:02:42.549> it<00:02:42.670> lean<00:02:42.790> more<00:02:43.150> forward

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
this velcro to make it lean more forward

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:44.910 
this velcro to make it lean more forward
to<00:02:43.660> have<00:02:43.780> a<00:02:43.810> little<00:02:44.140> looser<00:02:44.440> more<00:02:44.650> upright

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
to have a little looser more upright

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.190 
to have a little looser more upright
depend<00:02:45.400> on<00:02:45.459> what<00:02:45.579> kind<00:02:45.640> of<00:02:45.819> fit<00:02:46.000> you<00:02:46.090> like

unlike<00:03:09.280> a<00:03:09.310> nice<00:03:09.549> pant<00:03:09.849> you<00:03:09.940> we<00:03:10.030> might<00:03:10.209> have<00:03:10.420> a

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
unlike a nice pant you we might have a

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.470 
unlike a nice pant you we might have a
little<00:03:11.410> bit<00:03:11.620> of<00:03:11.680> exposure<00:03:11.950> here<00:03:12.459> it's<00:03:13.269> on<00:03:13.359> the

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
little bit of exposure here it's on the

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.300 
little bit of exposure here it's on the
back<00:03:13.660> it<00:03:13.870> has<00:03:13.989> single<00:03:14.410> density<00:03:14.590> perforated

back it has single density perforated

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.830 
back it has single density perforated
foam<00:03:15.489> which<00:03:16.030> really<00:03:16.269> increases<00:03:16.810> a

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
foam which really increases a

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.990 
foam which really increases a
ventilation<00:03:17.410> of<00:03:17.500> the<00:03:17.620> girdle<00:03:17.829> so<00:03:18.760> here's<00:03:18.910> a

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
ventilation of the girdle so here's a

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.659 
ventilation of the girdle so here's a
quick<00:03:19.269> look<00:03:19.480> with<00:03:19.690> the<00:03:19.810> X<00:03:19.959> 60<00:03:20.379> girdle<00:03:20.799> with<00:03:21.430> the
