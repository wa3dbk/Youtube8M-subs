I<00:02:19.480> went<00:02:19.870> for<00:02:20.080> this<00:02:20.170> initially<00:02:20.890> because<00:02:21.190> I

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
I went for this initially because I

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.000 
I went for this initially because I
figured<00:02:21.430> that<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.120> rubber<00:02:22.330> wood<00:02:23.019> ed<00:02:23.470> would

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
figured that the rubber wood ed would

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.370 
figured that the rubber wood ed would
add<00:02:24.190> more<00:02:24.489> protection<00:02:25.120> and<00:02:25.390> shock<00:02:25.840> absorbency

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
add more protection and shock absorbency

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.380 
add more protection and shock absorbency
in<00:02:26.739> the<00:02:26.830> case<00:02:27.040> of<00:02:27.070> a<00:02:27.340> fall<00:02:27.640> since<00:02:27.970> I'm<00:02:28.120> going<00:02:28.330> to
