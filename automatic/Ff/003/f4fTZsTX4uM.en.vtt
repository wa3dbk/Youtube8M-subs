00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:17.820
 this super simple and economical idea of 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:21.230
 a sweetie bag of princess Sofia 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:25.470
 The necessary material is china paper 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:29.039
 corrugated cardboard in purple color of 37 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:33.920

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:54.420
 cutouts or stickers with the characters 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:57.239
 of princess Sofia 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.719
 first we paste the cardboard to form a 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.719
 cylinder 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.860
 since we have the cylinder we're going to 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.780
 paste on the piece of cardboard and 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.590
 we press to keep us with a 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.590
 Oval shaped 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.340
 let's cut out the excess cardboard 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:10.700
 in one of the foami strips we cut 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.900
 on the one hand to give shape to hummingbird 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.900
 is or mountaineers 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.690
 in the same way we are going to cut out another 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.690
 strip 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.800
 let's say one of the strips in the part of 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.800
 above the boat 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.410
 I'm going to cut out this little bit that is 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.410
 overrun 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.660
 in the bottom part we get the other 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.660
 strip 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:25.150
 let's say the last strip of foami for 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.150
 form the handle of the sachet 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.959
 finally we paste the sticker or cut 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.510
 of princess Sofia, that's how the 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.510

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.959
 china paper 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.150
