iron<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.780> just<00:01:48.810> try<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.590> get<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:49.920> as<00:01:50.100> straight

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
iron and just try to get it as straight

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.359 
iron and just try to get it as straight
as<00:01:50.460> possible<00:01:50.549> for<00:01:51.329> this<00:01:51.600> tutorial<00:01:52.259> but<00:01:52.500> always

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
as possible for this tutorial but always

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
is going to be uneven it's also going to

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.469 
is going to be uneven it's also going to
be<00:02:01.590> botched<00:02:02.130> when<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:02.670> go<00:02:02.820> to<00:02:02.880> straighten<00:02:03.360> it

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479

have<00:02:51.080> pretty<00:02:51.290> much<00:02:51.380> the<00:02:51.530> same<00:02:51.799> results<00:02:52.340> it

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
have pretty much the same results it

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.840 
have pretty much the same results it
just<00:02:52.640> goes<00:02:52.910> to<00:02:53.239> hit<00:02:53.450> depending<00:02:53.989> on<00:02:54.670> what<00:02:55.670> you

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.970 

so<00:03:44.239> I<00:03:44.450> know<00:03:44.599> that<00:03:44.780> I<00:03:44.989> want<00:03:45.230> my<00:03:45.290> lair<00:03:45.560> to<00:03:45.829> be<00:03:45.950> a

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
so I know that I want my lair to be a

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.460 
so I know that I want my lair to be a
little<00:03:46.610> tad<00:03:46.939> bit<00:03:47.209> shorter<00:03:47.689> so<00:03:47.930> I'm<00:03:47.989> gonna<00:03:48.200> go

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
little tad bit shorter so I'm gonna go

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.110 
little tad bit shorter so I'm gonna go
in<00:03:48.980> and<00:03:49.220> just<00:03:49.280> take<00:03:49.970> a<00:03:50.030> little<00:03:50.510> bit<00:03:50.720> more<00:03:50.780> off

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
in and just take a little bit more off

00:03:52.120 --> 00:04:05.780 
in and just take a little bit more off
and<00:03:53.120> just<00:03:53.989> tap<00:03:54.439> it

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.089 

and<00:04:06.450> now<00:04:06.629> to<00:04:06.689> cut<00:04:07.049> the<00:04:07.170> rest<00:04:07.379> of<00:04:07.590> the<00:04:07.680> hair<00:04:07.890> I'm

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
and now to cut the rest of the hair I'm

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:09.649 
and now to cut the rest of the hair I'm
going<00:04:08.400> to<00:04:08.580> use<00:04:08.760> the<00:04:08.909> hair<00:04:09.120> that<00:04:09.269> I<00:04:09.360> previously

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:09.659 
going to use the hair that I previously

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:24.730 
going to use the hair that I previously
cut<00:04:10.260> as<00:04:10.470> my<00:04:10.680> guide<00:04:10.950> and<00:04:11.959> just<00:04:12.959> continue<00:04:13.349> to<00:04:13.439> cut

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.500 

and<00:04:25.740> that's<00:04:26.280> pretty<00:04:26.580> much<00:04:26.699> all<00:04:26.940> you<00:04:27.150> have<00:04:27.360> to

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
and that's pretty much all you have to

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.360 
and that's pretty much all you have to
do<00:04:27.660> for<00:04:28.320> this<00:04:28.470> side<00:04:28.680> I'm<00:04:28.860> going<00:04:28.889> to<00:04:29.100> start<00:04:29.280> a

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
do for this side I'm going to start a

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.830 
do for this side I'm going to start a
little<00:04:29.610> bit<00:04:29.850> higher<00:04:30.120> I'm<00:04:30.389> going<00:04:30.539> to<00:04:30.600> start

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
little bit higher I'm going to start

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:57.400 
little bit higher I'm going to start
right<00:04:31.199> below<00:04:31.860> the<00:04:32.280> cheek<00:04:32.669> area

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.160 

and<00:04:57.580> that's<00:04:58.580> pretty<00:04:58.940> much<00:04:59.180> all<00:04:59.420> I<00:04:59.480> do<00:04:59.690> you<00:05:00.020> can

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.170 
and that's pretty much all I do you can

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.660 
and that's pretty much all I do you can
