00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.010
 hi to all so in this video we 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.730
 going to talk about hanau boosters so 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.200
 that's what made an entry 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.640
 shattering in the world of 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.180
 bodybuilding and supplements since 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.579
 the 2000s 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.970
 so what are the boosters of 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:40.210
 menno so normally it's supposed 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.560
 give the fishing excite us give 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.060
 full of energy and increase the 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.820
 congestion so the hainaut is the 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.610
 nitrogen monoxide 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.620
 it's a kind of hormone we can say 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.830
 whose precursors are arginine la 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.250
 citrine and so it's arginine we have 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.830
 spoken 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.890
 at the radius of amino acids this is the 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:02.380
 number one precursor of nitrogen monoxide 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.540
 so hatred and so it increases the 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.799
 congestion 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:09.220
 often people do not react 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:10.600
 too much arginine so in this case there 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.220
 advise to take pumpkin 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.710
 who is a precursor just before 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.829
 incriminate him and that is another way 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.509
 to actually produce more 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:21.280
 hanau and therefore have more congestion 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:23.950
 so in return in general these two 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.200
 ingredients in all the boosters of 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.229
 hanau as it is still the basis 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.520
 apart from that we find all the others 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.649
 ingredients found in the 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.999
 fat burners that we talked about in 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:36.609
 the video that concerns them so small 

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:38.770
 link to this video to know from 

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:41.280
 caffeine guarana of green tea extracts 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.899
 and so it's supposed to give fishing 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.329
 so it's this mixture of ingredients 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:48.579
 exciting and GrÃ©zian designs that increases 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:50.619
 the congestion that gives the boosters of 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:53.590
 we then often see also 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.819
 greedy so it's always useful because it 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.380
 can be useful to take before 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:59.139
 training if your meal is located 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.029
 away your last snack will not have 

00:01:59.139 --> 00:02:02.310
 enough away from your workout so that 

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:05.189
 can be something 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.439
 what to do there unfortunately also 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.060
 often finds a creative in and 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.670
 as we know creatine is not 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.680
 to learn before training but 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.599
 well taken split so the same 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.069
 watch the creatine video 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.920
 I explain how to take it 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.270
 because we find creatine especially 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.010
 creatine 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.990
 it's a little weird effort that does not 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.720
 useless and bah is anyone 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:30.960
 what and it shows that the brand that 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.960
 does not know much about it so 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.970
 So here is a good dehenauw booster 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.030
 a booster this concert of exciting so 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.670
 the ingredients of fat burners 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.050
 as well as anything that increases the 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.940
 so hainaut arginine the oil star 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.730
 etc. 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:50.130
 so the boosters know who I've 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.050
 access for everyone it's true that 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.180
 when you try in vain a booster 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.700
 we wonder after how we did 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.370
 to make sense so much we feel the 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.960
 little more the small effect it is true that 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.250
 to get to the training and then everything 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.110
 to have a little more fishing 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.800
 to decongest a little more is 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:10.890
 always nice so it's for all 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.120
 world there is no risk factor 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.790
 hamon had heart problems 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.940
 like the excitants but it stays when 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.880
 even created the games so it takes 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.140
 when so just before training in 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.190
 General 20 minutes before training 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:29.190
 you take your dose in quotation marks 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.410
 booster in water and for a 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.850
 some time we have fishing 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.740
 so watch out for the dose it depends 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.600
 brands all brands do not dare 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.610
 like that saved the 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.890
 recommendations of different threats 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.680
 on super physics I have you noted for 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.920
 what we chose this how to take them 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.330
 so directly passing over the 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.580
 manufacturer who sometimes tells 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:54.150
 whatever they think about his money and 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:58.890
 not our well-being and their 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:00.959
 progression after a tale so here it is 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.430
 there is no fixed term on common 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.370
 and we take it or not we can learn 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.560
 all year etc 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:10.860
 there is not too much god 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.230
 so now here you know this 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.950
 what is a hanau booster you know 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.540
 how to take it 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.579
 how to choose it in relation to these 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.040
 ingredients so if I forgot anything 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.139
 thing you do not hesitate you ask me 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.880
 vocation below the video and 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:24.860
 I will try to answer you in 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.970
 shortest time possible 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.970
 this is a good session for all
