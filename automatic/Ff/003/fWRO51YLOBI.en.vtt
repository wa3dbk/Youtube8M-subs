00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:07.720 
didn't think that somebody spent this

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:14.400 
didn't think that somebody spent this
much<00:00:07.930> time

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:14.410 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.910 

here's<00:00:14.950> the<00:00:15.130> mine<00:00:15.340> site<00:00:15.610> over<00:00:15.880> here<00:00:16.920> Clyde's

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:17.920 
here's the mine site over here Clyde's

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:32.440 
here's the mine site over here Clyde's
in<00:00:18.130> there<00:00:18.280> checking<00:00:18.970> it<00:00:19.030> out<00:00:20.100> but<00:00:21.100> yeah

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:42.730 

and<00:00:33.450> behind<00:00:33.780> them<00:00:33.930> knees<00:00:34.160> talk<00:00:35.160> there<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:35.910> is

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:42.740 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.260 

I've<00:00:42.950> been<00:00:43.250> all<00:00:43.370> closed<00:00:43.670> off<00:00:43.850> so<00:00:44.030> you<00:00:44.090> can't

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
I've been all closed off so you can't

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.160 
I've been all closed off so you can't
even<00:00:44.330> get<00:00:44.450> in<00:00:44.570> there<00:00:44.660> wouldn't<00:00:45.020> want<00:00:45.140> to

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
even get in there wouldn't want to

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.240 
even get in there wouldn't want to
anyway<00:00:45.380> it's<00:00:45.590> only<00:00:45.680> about<00:00:45.830> two<00:00:46.070> and<00:00:46.160> a<00:00:46.220> half

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
anyway it's only about two and a half

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.370 
anyway it's only about two and a half
feet<00:00:46.460> high<00:00:46.520> that's<00:00:46.910> full<00:00:47.090> of<00:00:47.120> water

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:50.380 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:58.410 

very<00:00:51.380> interesting<00:00:51.980> area

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:07.749 

huge<00:00:59.420> tailings<00:00:59.870> pile<00:01:06.159> another<00:01:07.159> tailings<00:01:07.580> pile

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
huge tailings pile another tailings pile

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:11.170 
huge tailings pile another tailings pile
just<00:01:08.000> up<00:01:08.150> above<00:01:09.020> the<00:01:09.799> area<00:01:10.130> they<00:01:10.880> were<00:01:10.940> just

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
just up above the area they were just

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.240 
just up above the area they were just
out<00:01:11.360> and<00:01:11.690> there's<00:01:12.610> the<00:01:13.610> goal<00:01:13.820> hole<00:01:15.220> that<00:01:16.220> goes

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
out and there's the goal hole that goes

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.540 
out and there's the goal hole that goes
down<00:01:16.820> about<00:01:17.240> 40<00:01:18.550> 50<00:01:19.550> feet<00:01:20.000> so<00:01:20.500> we<00:01:21.500> can<00:01:21.649> see<00:01:21.830> it's

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
down about 40 50 feet so we can see it's

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:23.620 
down about 40 50 feet so we can see it's
too<00:01:22.820> dark<00:01:23.030> in<00:01:23.119> there<00:01:23.180> and<00:01:23.240> see<00:01:23.360> which<00:01:23.479> way<00:01:23.600> it

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
too dark in there and see which way it

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.960 
too dark in there and see which way it
goes<00:01:23.840> but<00:01:23.869> it's<00:01:24.200> obviously<00:01:24.500> been<00:01:25.490> closed<00:01:25.759> off

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
goes but it's obviously been closed off

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:36.620 
goes but it's obviously been closed off
practice<00:01:33.490> looks<00:01:34.490> like<00:01:34.640> there's<00:01:34.820> another

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
practice looks like there's another

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.490 
practice looks like there's another
another<00:01:37.409> one<00:01:37.619> up<00:01:37.770> there<00:01:38.810> the<00:01:39.810> old<00:01:39.930> tape<00:01:40.259> I'll

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
another one up there the old tape I'll

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.730 
another one up there the old tape I'll
go<00:01:40.649> check<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.100> out

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
go check that out

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:52.190 
go check that out
yeah<00:01:49.520> which<00:01:50.520> would<00:01:51.119> be<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.659> other<00:01:51.719> one<00:01:51.929> up<00:01:52.049> go

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
yeah which would be the other one up go

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.169 
yeah which would be the other one up go
what<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.860> original<00:01:53.369> one<00:01:53.490> where<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.670> gate<00:01:54.000> is

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
what the original one where that gate is

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:57.590 
what the original one where that gate is
on<00:01:54.329> there<00:01:55.789> okay<00:01:56.819> thought<00:01:57.090> I'd<00:01:57.210> take<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.390> little

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
on there okay thought I'd take a little

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.419 
on there okay thought I'd take a little
sample<00:01:57.780> from<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.229> alien<00:01:58.619> file<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:59.039> found<00:01:59.189> a

00:01:59.419 --> 00:01:59.429 
sample from the alien file I found a

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:01.700 
sample from the alien file I found a
nice<00:01:59.549> little<00:02:00.079> little<00:02:01.079> spot<00:02:01.319> here<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.619> got

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
so we're gonna try different holes in

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.510 
so we're gonna try different holes in
different<00:02:53.820> areas<00:02:54.030> and<00:02:54.150> see<00:02:54.270> what<00:02:55.310> they<00:02:56.310> came
