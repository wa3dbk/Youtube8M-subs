00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:14.740
 hi guys well my other video more 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:18.750
 of 774 and we're in a video of seemed 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:22.300
 the 3 playing on the metro operation map 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:28.510
 conquest with a friend called back 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:30.099
 again 96-86 I do not know but I'll tell you yo 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.050
 I will take care of most of the gameplays 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.120
 for the decent booster and I hope to see them 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.100
 in other videos more in my channel I am 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.800
 second in command of Justin and I leave 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.629
 with thiago ribero hello boys and like 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.070
 I just presented them and Manuel and 64 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.049
 I hope you have noticed the 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.850
 difference of the microphone with which 

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:47.290
 I was using the one I was using 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.030
 which is the way we're going to 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.129
 commenting on our videos we were 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.690
 doing a test not only audio 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:54.640
 but video as you can see many 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.860
 we are doing another test for the 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.019
 isie cap and we are realizing that 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.030
 can give us good results not 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.159
 excellent but yes I find very good 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.260
 in question that is one of the 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:07.180
 cheapest catches of the market yes I think 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.189
 that the cheapest boys and I think that 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.500
 it's a good idea for you to 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:13.420
 who like to make gameplays and want 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.190
 start doing I think it's a good 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.810
 way to start 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.700
 we are going to start with this 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.670
 obviously not going to put 500 thousand 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.410
 weights to a catcher because it's not my 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.670
 hobby maybe the manuel link yes but 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.380
 I would not give him money 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.750
 capturing tal of so much money 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.000
 it seems to me that there are other things 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.400
 important as a good pc that I would say 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.800
 that a good pc with some very good 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:37.570
 characteristics would give me better things 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.890
 that a super capturing think that the 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.500
 capturing is something secondary here in 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.640
 our channel boys and how they saw 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.020
 emanuel and he told us if we were in 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.750
 conquest in operation of the map 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.400
 metro operation and I just changed the 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.820
 class in price being engineer committed 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.900
 an error and change 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.330
 assault change assault and good boys 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.890
 of 1 year just to comment on the gameplay of 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.869
 manuel in but to tell them that the 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.670
 manuel channel and 64 to be that gives 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.380
 from this moment open enabled 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.520
 we are waiting for a quantity of 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.350
 very small subscribers so that 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.170
 they started finding people and getting to know 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.660
 the issues to talk about emanuel and 64 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.980
 the videos of him is not only going to be magical 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.750
 like him as what I had been driving 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.510
 but it's also going to be like in a thousand bars 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.069

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.010
 we are learning to play obviously and 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.350
 it is clearly visible because we have 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.610
 very little we acquired the game in what 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.769
 Well here we are doing is testing 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.630
 knowing we have been super good has been 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.190
 a hyper bacano process with which we have 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.750
 gone knowing the game thanks to good 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.880
 boy 95 thanks to cow in 96 thanks to 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.980

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.459
 boxes and it is said such then 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.870
 we commented how it is said and then thank you 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.269
 to them we have been learning more than 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.120
 this one of this great game that is worth the 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:56.530
 worth buying the original boys the 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.310
 experience playing multiplayer action 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.720
 very bacana we want to tell you that 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.230
 We wanted to tell you about other kinds of things 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.970
 as we are going to give order to the days 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.700
 of ways the days that we are going to upload mods 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.560
 will be on Monday and Wednesday 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.569
 Friday is one of those three days it 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.700

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.400
 be a mod that's why it's for every day be 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.230
 a model a is a motel Wednesday and a 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.540
 model Friday and possibly a video 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.680
 especially on weekends I think 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.090
 that would be what we want to comment 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.280
 remember to go through the channel of Manuel and 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.140
 1064 is the second in command of says team 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.690
 but then we wanted to do that part 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.840
 the channel in two stops for game place of 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.670
 hector 60 and here of minecraft games 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.080
 boys, that's all been 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.970
 thiago ribera I hope it is not remarkable 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.290
 difference in the comment principle of 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.590
 my brother and mine if they have hearing aids 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.239
 it shows quite 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.180
 those who ask who is from manuel and 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:50.849
 64 is my brother who is part of 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.349
 also says tim and boys I think that 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:54.840
 that was everything is a video 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:57.540
 supremely short informing them some 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.670
 things as always the notti that is going to 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.989
 put towards the channel news and 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.200
 nothing boys I hope you see the 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:05.250
 quality that we have achieved with the 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.140
 sorry with the catcher is that I'm 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.420
 giving sick of the voice we are going to do 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.819
 a lot of effort to talk and that's what 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.160
 that we have achieved with the capturing 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.390
 can achieve more changed the codecs and 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.209
 are some details that in the next 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.190
 video will notice that you have to see there 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.260
 to see how we improve the quality because 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.910
 I know that this can achieve not a super 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.340
 quality with a high golden catch 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.920
 but a very good quality for 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.960
 tricks and new things 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.720
 curious facts of some games like 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.190

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.280
