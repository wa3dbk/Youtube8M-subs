00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.600
 hello a greeting to all I am 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.120
 miguelángel of techno revolution and today 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.460
 I will show you how to install joves 8.4 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.860
 beta 3 completely free 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.080
 and without having an account of 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.610
 developer I want to clarify to you that it is 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.440
 a version that is in tests with what 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.180
 which I do not recommend its use to all 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.550
 world so keep that in mind and 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.800
 always make a backup copy of 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.110
 your device before performing this 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.820
 procedure now we're going to start 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.100
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.619
 open itunes and connect our 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.720
 device here you can see it is a 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.820
 iphone 6 plus at this moment I 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.380
 meeting in ios 8.3 with this 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.420
 device so if we click here 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.830
 in search update see how we 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.020
 places that no version more 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.579
 modern then what are we going to do what 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.290
 first is that we are going to make a 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.360
 backup we are going to click here 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.220
 to make a copy now and we are going to 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.930
 save can see here on device 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.730
 if you click and the preferences go 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.350
 and they go to devices they can see that 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.390
 we have a backup here 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.580
 done you can copy your applications and 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.770
 everything now secondly what are they going to 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:08.270
 do is they are going to download the file 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:10.340
 ipsw 38.4 in this case of beta 3 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.680
 can see how I can already have released the 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.900
 beta 1 and beta 2 and these two versions 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.060
 beta 1 and beta 2 are part of the 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.860
 free app trial program 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.450
 the only problem is that it is not open 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.030
 to everybody that is to say is a program 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.920
 public but that has only reached him 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.330
 this possibility of some people I 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.100
 I'm going to leave it under the link in the 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.800
 description to visit the page 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.509
 enter with your support query and see 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.340
 if they are lucky and can participate in 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.570
 this program because if so 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.060
 they could be trying these versions 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.390
 for free now there are websites 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.340
 8.4 beta 3 is already separate this is 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.479
 for the developers alone and I 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.890
 I will teach how to install it 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.530
 they just download it and they're going to 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.710
 download this file here this ips wy 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.200
 this ips w will then put these data 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.700
 will put them iphone the model of your iphone 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.130
 or in this case what was identified as the 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.020
 iphone 6 plus is 7.1 of your 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.320
 device may vary and then 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:08.179
 followed by 8.4 and then the identifier 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:11.810
 of the version that is 12 h 40 98 6 this 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.310
 is the 8.4 beta 3 identifier if not 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.830
 he puts them this puts another one for example 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.620
 if they go to of the beta 2 For 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.750
 as you can see is another identifier with 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.220
 which one make sure it is this one of all 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.260
 forms I will leave you in the description 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.849
 the data so that they do not get lost or 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.170
 have no problem and good once 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.879
 that we have it downloaded they keep it in 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.370
 the folder that you want us 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:33.380
 we go back to itunes and what are we going to do 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.019
 let's click on search update 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.780
 but pressing if they are in windows the 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:40.640
 shift key and look for update and if 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.799
 they are on the alt key 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.470
 that is, the option key and search 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:47.569
 update here you can see how it 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.849
 will display a window to search 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.670
 the point and ps w in this case we 're going to 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:54.950
 go again to look for it 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.349
 beta 3 and here we have it simply 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.970
 let's click on open and show us 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.470
 This little this window has be 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.200
 will update the iphone software to the 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.000
 version 8.4 of aigües and will verify the 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.160
 update with app simply you 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.930
 we are going to give update and now we only 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.640
 we have to wait for the process to finish 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.830
 all this I will put it in fast camera 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.830
 so they do not have to be waiting 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.930
 Another advantage of this is that as we are going to 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.090
 make an update and not a 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.010
 restoration we do not lose the information 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.510
 that we have on the device the copy 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.190
 Security is only if 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.630
 any error occurs any failure that 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.990
 there may be because it 's one of a version 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.990
 of tests 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.610
 We carry as the device is reset 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.610
 and the process is beginning 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.640
 she disconnected the device from 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.640
 iTunes 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.630
 and well it was just restarted 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.100
 and well we can see how we have it 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.100
 here again 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.140
 asks us for the device that we slide 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.430
 to update simply slide 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.810
 we enter our password 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.810
 we click on ok 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.640
 perfect because we already have it but 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.860
 it is not to put it of the symbol that makes 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:25.340
 we just unlock the device 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:27.860
 and well, here we have it 8.4 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.660
 the beta we will go to general 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.780
 software update you can see 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.880
 how it puts us to wish 8.4 also like 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.420
 you know, it includes an improvement 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.600
 What is it 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.310
 a change that the music application does not 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.000
 is a change is a complete redesign of 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.000
 the music application 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.810
 and well that 's all she showed it 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.880
 which is at 18.4 that is working 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.800
 correct way if you have any doubt 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.500
 some problem or some suggestion 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.460
 anything you want to know 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.260
