00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.349
 had to get off the ice 

00:00:01.349 --> 00:00:05.109
 anyway, the penalty bank king of the initial over 50 minutes 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:08.489
 in eleven sad Beck play the chance for the guests 

00:00:08.489 --> 00:00:11.649
 there wants to try but in between René unloads 

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:15.439
 what also Mark Droste i 

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:19.089
 under two hits for Hannover 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.710
 Guest one to zero why easily disposed of 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.550
 left with a man less on the ice 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:33.079
 has been in the lively hockey legend in Hannover since 88 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.100
 she's doing that 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.100
 Tolksdorf in the second 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.520
 the direct return 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.900
 Little shocked Prussia that makes a class team from setbacks 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.250
 are digested 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.520
 USA the IT 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.010
 Pass on Holzmann 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.490
 Well and the compensation bitter for Hannover the Mainzer 1 exactly 18 seconds 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.750
 after the tour 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.899
 Well, they all slept a bit in the really old sanctification 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.290
 Holzmaden uncovered routiniert 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.940
 He has over 100 internationals under his belt 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.940
 newly appointed to the national team 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.960
 Harburg Nickel first time served the beautiful leadership so fast 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.160
 But the ec card was not confused 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.160
 thoughtful construction leaned around 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:30.920
 View poses 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.420
 Stone also played for said 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.329
 Klaus Merk 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:37.329
 with the bat still in between 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.130
 Class prepared by the man with the 17 Florian Funk 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.210
 the parade of the Preusker 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.230
 Berlin on the hillside 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.360
 meanwhile again audible UIGEA the opponent of the Eger made the play 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.020
 then a small box his bearing in the red corner of Yousef Lehner his challenger 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.060
 from Acar 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.450
 Markus Bleicher 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.630
 bull's-eye 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.870
 and a very funny judgment of the referee only bleacher 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.870
 yes had not hit right 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.369
 Hannover so again outnumbered what luck must be said 

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:14.090
 we look 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.559
 one to zero 

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:18.719
 and we were said to chance for want 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:20.739
 but can be pushed too far 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.629
 the chance 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:26.129
 but clearly recognizable Denifl in the fist of the Bleus 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.809
 vulnerable on this evening 

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:32.229
 and the ETH agreed the last word 

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:35.179
 Quirks rust 

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:36.839
 dear leaves Bleicher 

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:38.779
 the puck on the post 

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:41.779
 and then again brands Roski 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.309
 for Hannover 

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:46.479
 March beaten for the second time 

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:49.359
 Huge cheers at the horse tower 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:50.639
 once again 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:53.389
 only on the more intense Sampras 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:55.099
 Pale shot 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:57.819
 through national information 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.499
 then Marten Rolff switches the fastest 

00:03:00.499 --> 00:03:03.499
 2 to 1 

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:08.699
 two minutes then in the middle third confusion before the EC Bad Orb gas not 

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:09.639
 so often 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:12.639
 but and you can see that again, faster counterattack 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.049
 Günter Preuß 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:19.839
 the 3 2 1 for the real 

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:22.739
 he would have thought that 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:23.560
 Klaus Merk 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.799
 bitterly angry 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:28.219
 two goals lead for Hannover after this second third of 

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:31.219
 End section and you feel that the Prussians had some plans 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:34.129
 Dries US or own 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:37.209
 but what happens to the connection for the table second 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.869
 it had to be shaky again 

00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:44.029
 but Bangemachen does not apply Hanover bravely stormed open with brand 

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:46.270
 the American 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.680
 have nothing to hold this evening 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.869
 14 2 

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:52.179
 for the moose 

00:03:52.179 --> 00:03:54.679
 Mross already the man of the evening for 

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:57.679
 five and a half thousand 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.259
 but the Prussians do not shoot as fast as they know 

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:03.609
 yes still something to offer 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:05.109
 and it looked like that 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:06.269
 Schorsch Holzmann 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.530
 The ERC narrowly missed Hartmut Nickel externally left 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:13.019
 but that Berlin in attack 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.359
 Jon Szabo 

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:17.799
 Jürgen Rumrich with his season goals number 15 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.370
 keep only 4 to 3 nerves 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.370
 in the last minute Berlin had taken the goalkeeper off the ice 

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:26.439
 and a lot happen 

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:29.439
 the way clear for Günter Boyks 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.330
 without exercising on just exercised 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.409
 until the 3rd 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:39.569
 Hanover hovers before him 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:41.009
 after the last disappointments 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:43.360
 this evaluates you had to say sensation
