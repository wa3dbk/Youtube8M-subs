00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Alright in this video we are going to look at finding components of vectors along another vector

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and projections of vectors onto other vectors

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.440
so to figure out the component of b onto a

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.420
we take the dot product a dot b and we divide that

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.560
by the magnitude of vector a

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.700
and then

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.520
to figure out the projection of vector b along

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.400
vector a, we take a dot b over a dot a

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.400
and multiply that by vector a

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.380
equivalently we can write that as a dot b over the

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.600
magnitude of a squared again times vector a

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.100
so if I leave off any of the little lines again those indicate vectors

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.740
everything I am talking about here is vectors so hopefully I wont accidentally do that.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:51.320
Okay so what we want to do is we are going to find both the component of b along a

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.400
and also the vector projection of b along a for these given vectors.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.560
alright so again to do the component

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.180
so to figure out the component of vector b along a

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.300
again we take the dot product a dot b

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.320
and then we divide that by the magnitude of vector a

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.220
so to do the dot product again we multiply respective

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.220
components so 1 times 2 will be 2

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.880
We will take 2 times -1

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.880
that will be -2

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.200
then we will add to that 3 times 4

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.200
which is going to be 12

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.660
We will divide that by the magnitude of

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.320
vector a, well the magnitude we just square the components

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.320
so 1 squared is 1

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.320
2 squared is 4

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.000
3 squared is going to be 9

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.520
and now we can just simplify this so

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.900
2 plus -2 is 0, we will have 12 on top

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.340
in the denominator looks like we are going to have

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.180
the square root of 14 so that is our component

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.260
of vector b along vector a

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:02.680
to do the projection of b along a

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.900
again the formula for that we just said was

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.500
a dot b and I am going to use this slightly different instead of doing a dot a

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.240
I am going to take the magnitude squared because we have already figured out the magnitude

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.240
and then we will multiply that by vector a

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.840
well again we figured out what a dot b was that is what we had in the numerator a second ago

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.840
thats just going to be 12

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.380
we can take the magnitude of vector a and square it. Well again the denominator

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.480
was the magnitude so we will just take the square root of 14 and square it.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.480
and that will just leave us with 14

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.880
and then we multiply that by our vector a

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.640
so again vector a had components 1, 2, 3

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.340
well lets see I guess this reduces to 6 over 7

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.340
and again we are just going to multiply

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.400
so recall when you have a constant out front we just multiply each component by that number

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.360
so we will get 6 over 7 times 1 which will just be 6 over 7

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.720
we will get 6 over 7 times 2 which will give us 12 over 7

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.520
and then  we will multiply 6 over 7 times 3

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.520
that will give us 18 over 7

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.900
and now we have our vector projection.
