00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.020
 man's knowledge 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.330
 Let's talk a little bit about how the game is. 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:28.230
 Where are you playing in the counter attack? 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:38.340
 the 2050 player with no animals here in 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:40.290
 the focus is 50 50 100 and 200 m in 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.840
 several faces of your game regularly 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:48.809
 online very cool 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:51.840
 bn in fact even that the guy had 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.579
 two days I did not know it was a guy 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.480
 Which I admire as hell is the king. 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.820
 movie 'the sic guy in the grids plays in 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.649
 mega face it there caramel and 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.649
 Relaxed talking to you 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:15.390
 rafa rafa was very good 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.259
 I went there on google want he's a guy 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.850
 which plays only 200 400 and 300 600 and went well 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.930
 It's cool to be able to talk to him and I said 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.290
 I want green 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.290
 our cool such as closed breaks 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.939
 you know and can also 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:34.860
 will present and in the legal wood 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:37.170
 sometimes one with that total focus on the game 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.500
 they do not have the dimension of what really 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.659
 It's happening like this in no time. 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.549
 so expensive does not realize that it's a bit 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.670
 only people who play that game 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.399
 if you know but and enter both the wave 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.590
 that poses is normal ie you realize 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:57.030
 really what happens north but this 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.759
 It's from this presentation with top elite face 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.670
 reception at the time understood that it is 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.210
 very gratifying we make poor 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.210
 cool 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:12.150
 but it's basically this was pretty cool and it's 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.410
 that I found where almost packs is a 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.150
 face that was last I met 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:21.930
 personally deny it online and it is already 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:30.360
 very my friend and was hitting this you 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:32.670
 I quickly told him what he 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:41.730
 spoke the reason for him to play but 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:43.440
 them and some online tournaments that the 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.420
 Salt if it 's a mistake 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.120
 I would say that it is the total top of the world 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.580
 so poker world is a guy 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.920
 extremely disciplined so the guy 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.280
 that we actually played some more guys 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:59.250
 the world and for the games he 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.350
 really does not have as much action and 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.290
 there is not much action 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:07.230
 people are willing to confront 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:10.440
 because he does not play 50 regularly 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:15.570
 So it's still worth it for me 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:16.440
 online 2150 patience 6,077 more 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:21.000
 have art 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:23.840
 he's not 151 cheaper for him so why 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.410
 that he should have said that 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:32.160
 Happen in Brazil, what happens here? 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:41.760
 already in europe the site start is 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:44.010
 regionalized in the region by 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.350
 example could only play not only for me 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:51.150
 no sex, I would have to change country 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:54.450
 surely would not have a place to play 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:57.930
 where he could face other people from the 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:00.300
 whole world but it's complicated to talk about 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:10.700
 market by many the most 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:10.700
 My birthday is born, it would be very bad. 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:18.920
 the race is like this there is room for 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:20.389
 to get Ana, I do not know if I actually 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.870
 I also tendentious next year 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:26.330
 including my daughter living outside 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.460
 celebrated and but I like much more 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.820
 silent to get something else 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:35.330
 with over 11 countries with a city 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:39.710
 europe interior is a more focused thing 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:43.600
 for culture I do not play party then it is 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.600
 more or less my moments of life
