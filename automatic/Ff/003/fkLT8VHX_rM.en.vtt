00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.800
 and then it is only with her friends she is 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:22.750
 strong here 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:26.740
 we took the 80 p. shower said it was 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:30.039
 found a shock and passed away today 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:33.689
 something and this I have to talk to 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.689
 I 'll talk later, neighborhood. 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:42.949
 ae 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:59.100
 can see already dropped to 70 and few by 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:04.650
 cent of use tpu 65 there the center one 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:07.160
 foliage use of gpu drops to 60 70 and 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.160
 few percent 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:16.800
 so open mary increases again goes 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:21.570
 to oscillate 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:25.140
 others are very low in the use of gpu 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.660
 1080 worst 60 70 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:33.479
 now we will see with a session that 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:35.580
 I have found here his father 68% then increases 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.580
 A little bit but it will be falling to 70 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.909
 80 and figure out how to eliminate this 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:45.579
 bottleneck leave gto 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.579
 all the time above 80 to 90 percent 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.880
 let's take a little here on releases 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.990
 It is where the google there looks 65% to 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:03.049
 Law 70 66 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:06.140
 69 67 this is bad means that the gpu 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.430
 is being underutilized and the game 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.160
 some way you 're not getting 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.580
 I used to love 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.819
 Now I'll show you how it is. 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:19.640
 even in the game with the same resolution with 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.470
 an authorized sector 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:27.470
 in this attack alone here that is well 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:33.560
 ruinzinha as the ascendant show the 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:37.220
 options and settings she 1080p 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:40.850
 full off actually appeared 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.769
 now it was all turned on in the shadow on 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.560
 medium texture in high quality 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.420
 choose to disable it in via 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:55.940
 grounded and the big movie 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:03:00.290
 turned on but I think I managed to 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:05.410
 here will not give the difference dropped 70 75 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.410
 61 64 per cent 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.690
 gets too much use of gpu 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:20.450
 Now I'll show you, see a 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:23.420
 slightly higher resolution with speech 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:28.130
 Well done. 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:32.260
 interesting here today I got the 660 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:35.900
 gt x 160 with 2 gb of memory 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:40.250
 I tested here in 1080p of light and gave 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:47.810
 really a problem and never reach the 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:50.290
 100% of the gpu I did I went there sr 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:55.760
 I increased the resolution a bit to 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:04:03.070
 2.103 1.183 namely by using a 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:06.400
 reduction of up to 4 4 GB of RAM 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:10.670
 full screen 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:14.030
 logical average in high quality 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.020
 down the distance of the vision a little bit 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.820
 forward 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.270
 the disabled club that does not have 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.460
 A lot of difference really I do not think 

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:23.870
 everything else activated - the movie comes 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:30.320
 I also do not think it's cool, I do not like 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:32.210
 be done and amazingly it looks looks 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:38.419
 How much fernandinho is doing in that 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:42.030
 resolution had 36 37 35 frames playing 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:45.240
 running above 40 front 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.710
 is impressive for a processor that 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:53.280
 you can 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:57.090
 in phase 1 150 180 reais of a child can 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:59.130
 see there the 40 and for 50 frames 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:02.240
 This is going to be a short video just for 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:07.980
 show these details and this mallet 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:11.370
 1080p people or not 100% you 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:13.920
 simply fool the gpu by increasing a 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:17.490
 a little through Mr. 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:23.640
 in this case I put it just above the 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:26.370
 80 eyed peep gets 97 98 percent 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.840
 all the time, sometimes 85 but it's 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.650
 very difficult 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:34.980
 which proves once again that in 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:37.670
 higher resolutions up to the mpb bar here 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.670
 work better 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:46.009
 until the phenom ii x4 was making Sunday 

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:49.039
 above 50 female falls below 30 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:52.009
 very difficult below that average of 35 to 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:53.659
 40 front and raise a little more at 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:57.069
 map this video you short it 's only for 

00:05:53.659 --> 00:06:00.679
 show this mallet and simas and tango 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:06:05.179
 works up to love us cheap but even 

00:06:00.679 --> 00:06:09.939
 No 3 23 50 

00:06:05.179 --> 00:06:17.029
 works the same way she 98% of gpu 

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:25.580
 99 above 35 40 females in 2000 

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:28.879
 Let's see it again here 2103 for 1,138 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:31.610
 which is a point 2 times the full hd 

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:34.959
 This is a bad thing for anyone with 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:37.909
 problem in full hd on processors 

00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:40.899
 I usually do not go out 

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:44.389
 that really ties in a rope and wins 

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:45.559
 your share of a video your system with 

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:48.919
 the sr 

00:06:45.559 --> 00:06:53.899
 and you're ready to get 100% 

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:57.709
 of your network to with the excellent result 

00:06:53.899 --> 00:07:01.430
 well I'll stay here I'll bet 

00:06:57.709 --> 00:07:04.900
 in the group and cmb reads who does not know 

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.900
 Look, I'll take a hug. 

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:18.980
 the personal law here I will give some tips of 

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:22.020
 driver how to get the most out of your gpu 

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:25.830
 here in the control panel of india 

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:29.880
 we always put the physique just for the 

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:32.120
 gpu always choose only gto never to 

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:37.560
 automatic selection 

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:40.470
 here at the triple buffet always on 

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:46.380
 a 7 to get the cock in the amd is this 

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:49.440
 here, and 20% live in these 

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:54.350
 sufficient to give softness 33 is very 

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:56.790
 20% - fps by placing these settings 

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:58.620
 You'll be able to take the bottleneck out of the 

00:07:56.790 --> 00:08:01.950
 amd using sr 

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:04.640
 This is a backcountry and only completed the video 

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:04.640
 said
