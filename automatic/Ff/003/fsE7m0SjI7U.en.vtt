ourselves pretty much everything behind
the<00:02:34.340> scenes<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:35.049> it's<00:02:36.049> been<00:02:36.319> a<00:02:36.349> great<00:02:36.650> music

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:37.159 
the scenes and it's been a great music

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:38.500 
the scenes and it's been a great music
we<00:02:37.280> came<00:02:37.549> together<00:02:37.730> with<00:02:37.970> power<00:02:38.209> but<00:02:38.390> it's

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
we came together with power but it's

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.559 
we came together with power but it's
also<00:02:38.659> been<00:02:38.959> really<00:02:39.319> nice<00:02:39.620> to<00:02:40.299> find<00:02:41.299> someone

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.819 

I<00:02:55.060> think<00:02:56.060> four<00:02:56.299> people<00:02:56.599> learned<00:02:57.109> about<00:02:57.260> before

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829

00:02:57.829 --> 00:02:59.530 
I think four people learned about before
I<00:02:58.160> think<00:02:58.430> they're<00:02:58.609> going<00:02:58.700> to<00:02:58.760> get<00:02:58.940> a<00:02:58.970> real<00:02:59.239> kick

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
I think they're going to get a real kick

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:10.280 
I think they're going to get a real kick
out<00:02:59.989> of<00:03:00.049> the<00:03:00.319> sound

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.670
