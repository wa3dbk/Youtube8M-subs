00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:38.610
 is it really tv transmitters works 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:46.739
 who wants to ride one here has a good one here 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:46.739
 this scheme really works here 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.020
 as signal source I used the ideal game 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:19.550
 here the video input is audio 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.100
 I'm going to turn on the transmitter now. 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.320
 see that on the TV the transmitter is already 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.320
 operating 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.260
 channel 4 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.280
 channel 3 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.110
 Now I'll call the video game. 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:36.370
 is operating on channel 4 and channel 3 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.370
 between these two 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:03:01.269
 see that it is still necessary to adjust the 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:04.470
 oscillator of 4.5 megahertz that the 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.470
 modeler from where 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:21.550
 Ok I'm using the 2m 22 18 one 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:27.630
 simple antenna that I am mounting it 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:33.880
 also a more efficient antenna 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:37.060
 to send a signal farther east 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:40.770
 signal using this traffic may 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.770
 reach a mile away 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:53.790
 Some adjustments still need to be made in this 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:59.300
 coil and variable capacitor here for 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.300
 gestar right frequency 4.56 hertz 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.060
 where then a signal will be reassessed for 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.060
 TV 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:11.959
 Good, is this missing to make some adjustment? 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.959
 thanks 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:35.890
 not to rock and roll to door to door 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.890
 door to 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:17.110
 I'm just like a good match.
