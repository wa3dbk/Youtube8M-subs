00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.490 
my hair without adding any hair from the

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
sides now it's basically the same braid

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.900 
sides now it's basically the same braid
that<00:02:49.740> I've<00:02:49.860> shown<00:02:50.070> in<00:02:50.310> one<00:02:50.430> of<00:02:50.550> my<00:02:50.670> previous

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
videos so the left strand goes under its

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.600
