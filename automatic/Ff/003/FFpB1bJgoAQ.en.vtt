00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:20.159
 and then we get out of the oven ready 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:24.180

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.729
 you already have a biscuit how to work it 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.000
 I got a cake here and here 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.579
 so you see this one cake 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.280
 get out of shape and show you how it 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.340
 cut in half means to me 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:46.049
 approximately learn here two cakes you 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:48.090
 and from this also make a cake and so you 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.590
 see our cake of mine 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.590
 cut into two parts 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:04.560
 and we get two cakes like this 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:11.459
 you see 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.459
 it means one part I was in reverse our 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:21.459
 on our form where the biscuit was baked 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:23.860
 further means that we will do i took 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:27.370
 water at room temperature of about 100 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.700
 gram and launches there gelatin 15 grams 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:36.549
 and let half an hour insist and then we 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:39.400
 let's heat somewhere to 60 degrees and here is our 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:42.400
 gelatin see already stood for half an hour 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.450
 us so here it is on its side and now I have it 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.299
 I will pour out 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.609
 here here is 100 grams of milk 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.480
 there is lukewarm milk, I'm just here 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:52.329
 notice 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.239
 and we will gradually heat up somewhere 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:58.870
 up to 60 degrees to be all alone 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:02.609
 dissolved and now it will be an hour 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.609
 gradually dissolve in milk 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:19.120
 already dissolved I turn off further I 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.870
 weighed 300 grams of cottage cheese from me 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.239
 home 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:28.989
 I will happen to him as he is home 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:32.040
 I need it and here I will probably forget 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.040
 spoons 3 sahara 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:46.110
 well and now everything will be hammered 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:07.470
 Now I will add our milk gelatin and 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.180
 will continue 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:46.599
 so all you see enough what mass 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:52.729
 turned out 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:05:03.069
 so on we lay out on our biscuit 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:05:05.840
 our cottage cheese whipped with milk or 

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:09.879
 gelatin and 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.879
 we will put this mass in the fridge 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:24.130
 I put a pot of water on gas and 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:27.940
 Now here I put in a bowl on top 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:29.790
 water bath and beast 200 grams of chocolate 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:34.470
 black 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:38.310
 hard chocolate and pour 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.310
 50 grams of milk 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:48.110
 and you see what kind of chocolate we expect 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:52.550
 but this is my bitter chocolate so I 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.550
 add 100 grams of powdered sugar 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:23.900
 This is how we get chocolate 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.900
 now he will soon be wolves 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.740
 this is our cake which we made of 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:39.380
 cottage cheese 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:44.080
 I turned him on a platter so I 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:59.630
 I want to smear a tank with chocolate here 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:07:05.780
 chocolate will help the form as I will coat 

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:10.790
 and here is our cake and alignment ready see 

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:16.120
 as we made chocolate around the edges very 

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:16.120
 beautiful now I want to cut a piece 

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:37.240
 cake and here's our cottage cheese cake on 

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:46.520
 I cut out a little plate like this 

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:50.570
 see where the salad edge is there you can see the biscuit 

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:53.630
 we have cottage cheese here so very tender 

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:57.280
 Of course we are without our biscuit 

00:07:53.630 --> 00:08:01.810
 soaked but you can soak 

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:01.810
 bon appetit and good luck to you
