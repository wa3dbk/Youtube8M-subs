00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
make really cool flip-flops and so you

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.150 
make really cool flip-flops and so you
just<00:00:28.420> take<00:00:28.540> an<00:00:28.900> average<00:00:29.259> pair<00:00:29.890> of<00:00:29.950> flip-flops

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
just take an average pair of flip-flops

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.130 
just take an average pair of flip-flops
so<00:00:30.550> you<00:00:30.640> can<00:00:30.790> get<00:00:30.910> really<00:00:31.150> cheap<00:00:31.240> at<00:00:31.689> the

like 5 minutes to make and then you just
have<00:01:46.929> to<00:01:47.050> let<00:01:47.200> them<00:01:47.410> dry<00:01:47.739> and<00:01:48.130> then<00:01:48.640> you<00:01:48.670> can

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
have to let them dry and then you can

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.300

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.570 
difficult to make what you do is you're
going<00:03:58.720> to<00:03:58.840> cut<00:03:59.170> your<00:03:59.200> flip-flops<00:03:59.800> as<00:04:00.010> shown

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
going to cut your flip-flops as shown

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.130 
going to cut your flip-flops as shown
and<00:04:00.850> I'm<00:04:01.090> sorry<00:04:01.420> I<00:04:01.510> didn't<00:04:01.720> get<00:04:01.810> this<00:04:01.990> on

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
and I'm sorry I didn't get this on

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.810 
and I'm sorry I didn't get this on
camera<00:04:02.590> but<00:04:02.890> this<00:04:03.130> is<00:04:03.340> what<00:04:03.490> it<00:04:03.580> looks<00:04:03.730> like

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
camera but this is what it looks like

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.760 
camera but this is what it looks like
afterwards<00:04:04.360> so<00:04:04.630> you<00:04:04.720> can<00:04:04.870> just<00:04:05.020> follow<00:04:05.290> what

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
afterwards so you can just follow what

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:06.360 
afterwards so you can just follow what
this<00:04:05.920> looks<00:04:06.130> like

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
this looks like

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.030 
this looks like
then<00:04:06.880> take<00:04:07.360> the<00:04:07.570> two<00:04:07.810> back<00:04:08.110> straps<00:04:08.590> and

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
then take the two back straps and

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.790 
then take the two back straps and
connect<00:04:09.880> them<00:04:10.090> together<00:04:10.390> up<00:04:10.900> at<00:04:11.080> the<00:04:11.200> top<00:04:11.470> and

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
connect them together up at the top and

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.980 
connect them together up at the top and
you're<00:04:12.730> going<00:04:12.910> to<00:04:13.060> want<00:04:13.240> to<00:04:13.450> staple<00:04:13.750> them

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:13.990 
you're going to want to staple them

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:15.690 
you're going to want to staple them
together<00:04:14.170> it's<00:04:14.650> kind<00:04:14.920> of<00:04:14.980> difficult<00:04:15.160> to<00:04:15.430> do

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
together it's kind of difficult to do

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.449 
together it's kind of difficult to do
but<00:04:16.000> once<00:04:16.270> you<00:04:16.620> staple<00:04:17.620> it<00:04:17.739> you're<00:04:17.890> good<00:04:18.100> to<00:04:18.280> go

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
but once you staple it you're good to go

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.940 
but once you staple it you're good to go
and<00:04:18.760> then<00:04:19.570> after<00:04:20.109> it<00:04:20.230> since<00:04:20.500> you<00:04:20.590> don't<00:04:20.709> want

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
and then after it since you don't want

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.880 
and then after it since you don't want
any<00:04:21.130> staples<00:04:21.489> like<00:04:21.910> jabbing<00:04:22.570> into<00:04:22.870> you<00:04:23.020> take<00:04:23.710> a

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.510 
band because you wouldn't want it on
there<00:05:54.020> just<00:05:54.320> like<00:05:54.440> hanging<00:05:54.710> it<00:05:54.860> around<00:05:55.040> so

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
there just like hanging it around so

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.570 
there just like hanging it around so
yeah<00:05:55.930> then<00:05:56.930> the<00:05:57.140> very<00:05:57.380> last<00:05:57.650> step<00:05:58.040> of<00:05:58.250> these

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.580 
yeah then the very last step of these

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:59.200 
yeah then the very last step of these
flip-flops

00:05:59.200 --> 00:05:59.210 
flip-flops

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.480 
flip-flops
I<00:05:59.330> took<00:05:59.390> some<00:05:59.810> glitter<00:06:00.140> glue<00:06:00.470> and<00:06:00.800> placed<00:06:01.310> it

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
I took some glitter glue and placed it

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.490 
I took some glitter glue and placed it
over<00:06:01.640> the<00:06:01.940> fabric<00:06:02.540> because<00:06:02.900> I<00:06:02.930> didn't<00:06:03.350> want

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.500 
over the fabric because I didn't want

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.980 
over the fabric because I didn't want
the<00:06:03.710> fabric<00:06:04.100> showing<00:06:04.550> and<00:06:04.760> the<00:06:05.450> glitter<00:06:05.690> looks

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
the fabric showing and the glitter looks

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.620 
the fabric showing and the glitter looks
better<00:06:06.260> than<00:06:06.560> that<00:06:06.800> so<00:06:07.580> that<00:06:08.030> is<00:06:08.180> all<00:06:08.360> for<00:06:08.570> this

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:08.630 
better than that so that is all for this

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.810 
better than that so that is all for this
video<00:06:08.840> I<00:06:09.050> hope<00:06:09.350> you<00:06:09.560> enjoyed<00:06:09.980> and<00:06:10.370> you<00:06:10.460> liked

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 
all these different pairs of flip-flops

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.710 
all these different pairs of flip-flops
because<00:06:13.130> I<00:06:13.640> definitely<00:06:13.850> do<00:06:14.300> and<00:06:14.570> I<00:06:14.660> think

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:14.720 
because I definitely do and I think
