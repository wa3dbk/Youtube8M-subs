00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
two new cars I mean you have to

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.039 
two new cars I mean you have to
experience<00:03:53.820> this<00:03:54.120> I<00:03:54.330> mean<00:03:54.480> none<00:03:54.660> of<00:03:54.690> us<00:03:54.840> has

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
experience this I mean none of us has

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.500 
experience this I mean none of us has
driven<00:03:55.769> this<00:03:56.430> car<00:03:56.489> none<00:03:56.940> of<00:03:57.030> us<00:03:57.150> has<00:03:57.269> driven

such<00:03:57.959> heavy<00:03:58.170> fuel<00:03:58.440> loads<00:03:58.680> but<00:03:59.640> I<00:04:00.090> mean<00:04:00.480> it's

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
such heavy fuel loads but I mean it's

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.780 
such heavy fuel loads but I mean it's
it's<00:04:00.930> honestly<00:04:01.470> a<00:04:01.709> little<00:04:02.010> bit<00:04:02.190> uncomfortable

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
it's honestly a little bit uncomfortable

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.940 
it's honestly a little bit uncomfortable
to<00:04:03.150> that<00:04:03.989> you<00:04:04.110> know<00:04:04.230> you<00:04:04.290> can<00:04:04.530> have<00:04:04.680> a<00:04:04.709> car

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
to that you know you can have a car

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.670 
to that you know you can have a car
light<00:04:05.450> like<00:04:06.450> qualifying<00:04:06.959> simulation<00:04:07.500> and

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
light like qualifying simulation and

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.550 
light like qualifying simulation and
then<00:04:07.709> you<00:04:07.890> must<00:04:08.069> put<00:04:08.250> some

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
then you must put some

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.650 
then you must put some
whew<00:04:08.739> but<00:04:09.550> it<00:04:09.670> is<00:04:09.760> what<00:04:09.940> it<00:04:09.970> is<00:04:10.120> it<00:04:10.360> is<00:04:10.480> for

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
whew but it is what it is it is for

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 
it's a it's I guess it's a good thing

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.700 
it's a it's I guess it's a good thing
for<00:04:52.120> me<00:04:52.180> that<00:04:52.419> I<00:04:52.450> can<00:04:52.660> concentrate<00:04:53.290> a<00:04:53.590> little

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
for me that I can concentrate a little

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.430 
for me that I can concentrate a little
bit<00:04:53.889> more<00:04:54.040> on<00:04:54.669> the<00:04:54.729> racing<00:04:55.120> on<00:04:55.320> working<00:04:56.320> with

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
bit more on the racing on working with

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:59.480 
bit more on the racing on working with
the<00:04:56.500> team<00:04:56.680> and<00:04:56.919> hopefully<00:04:57.669> on<00:04:58.030> winning<00:04:58.300> races

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
the team and hopefully on winning races

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.400 
the team and hopefully on winning races
have<00:05:00.490> you<00:05:00.520> been<00:05:00.700> anyway<00:05:01.000> changed<00:05:01.540> during<00:05:02.110> the

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
have you been anyway changed during the

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.740 
have you been anyway changed during the
last<00:05:02.650> four<00:05:03.010> years<00:05:03.210> are<00:05:04.210> you're<00:05:04.360> more<00:05:04.600> relaxed

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
last four years are you're more relaxed

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.690 
last four years are you're more relaxed
now<00:05:05.610> more<00:05:06.610> dedicated<00:05:07.150> more<00:05:07.720> concentrated<00:05:08.470> I

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
now more dedicated more concentrated I

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.670 
now more dedicated more concentrated I
guess<00:05:09.700> so<00:05:09.729> yeah<00:05:10.030> I<00:05:10.060> mean<00:05:10.270> I<00:05:10.330> think<00:05:10.600> it's<00:05:11.500> a

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
guess so yeah I mean I think it's a

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.210 
guess so yeah I mean I think it's a
nature<00:05:12.460> that<00:05:12.490> happens<00:05:13.560> with<00:05:14.560> gaining

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
nature that happens with gaining

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.640 
nature that happens with gaining
experience<00:05:15.550> that<00:05:16.510> you<00:05:16.630> sort<00:05:16.810> of<00:05:16.870> judge<00:05:17.140> things

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
experience that you sort of judge things

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.100 
experience that you sort of judge things
from<00:05:18.460> a<00:05:18.580> certain<00:05:18.760> or<00:05:19.450> from<00:05:19.780> a<00:05:19.870> slightly

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
from a certain or from a slightly

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.340 
from a certain or from a slightly
different<00:05:20.260> angle<00:05:21.060> it<00:05:22.060> does<00:05:22.270> happen<00:05:22.510> yeah<00:05:22.870> I

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.350 
different angle it does happen yeah I

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.780 
different angle it does happen yeah I
hope<00:05:23.979> to<00:05:24.160> the<00:05:24.250> positive<00:05:24.660> find<00:05:25.660> out
