your Blastoise active either if it gets

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.230 
your Blastoise active either if it gets
killed<00:01:12.310> because<00:01:12.550> then<00:01:12.759> you're<00:01:12.880> just<00:01:12.910> kind<00:01:13.180> of

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
killed because then you're just kind of

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.139 
killed because then you're just kind of
screwed<00:01:13.500> three<00:01:14.500> Blastoise<00:01:14.979> because<00:01:15.759> i<00:01:16.000> mean

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:16.149 
screwed three Blastoise because i mean

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:18.300 
screwed three Blastoise because i mean
i'll<00:01:16.300> feel<00:01:16.720> like<00:01:16.840> four<00:01:17.140> is<00:01:17.259> necessary<00:01:17.800> into<00:01:18.130> is

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310

far too little for squirtle probably get

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.460 
far too little for squirtle probably get
away<00:01:22.330> with<00:01:22.390> three<00:01:22.780> if<00:01:22.869> you<00:01:22.960> really<00:01:23.170> wanted<00:01:23.409> to

to<00:03:47.480> not<00:03:48.480> saying<00:03:48.690> maybe<00:03:48.900> like<00:03:49.109> a<00:03:49.140> goth<00:03:49.380> to<00:03:49.530> tell

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
to not saying maybe like a goth to tell

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:50.810 
to not saying maybe like a goth to tell
Phil<00:03:49.890> but<00:03:50.100> if<00:03:50.190> I'm<00:03:50.280> hitting<00:03:50.459> that<00:03:50.670> I'm

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
Phil but if I'm hitting that I'm

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.520 
Phil but if I'm hitting that I'm
probably<00:03:50.940> screwed<00:03:51.329> anyways<00:03:51.840> so<00:03:52.320> I'm<00:03:52.380> not

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
probably screwed anyways so I'm not

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.940 
probably screwed anyways so I'm not
really<00:03:52.680> worried<00:03:52.980> about<00:03:53.040> it<00:03:53.329> for<00:03:54.329> superior's

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
really worried about it for superior's

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.310 
really worried about it for superior's
because<00:03:55.950> that's<00:03:56.130> the<00:03:56.250> easiest<00:03:56.280> way<00:03:56.730> to<00:03:56.790> just

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
because that's the easiest way to just

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.050 
because that's the easiest way to just
screw<00:03:58.320> people<00:03:58.500> over<00:03:58.739> late<00:03:59.070> game<00:03:59.310> or<00:03:59.640> mid<00:03:59.850> game

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
screw people over late game or mid game

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.000 
screw people over late game or mid game
or<00:04:00.630> even<00:04:00.810> early<00:04:01.079> game<00:04:01.230> depending<00:04:01.620> on<00:04:01.739> how<00:04:01.980> a

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
or even early game depending on how a

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.670 
or even early game depending on how a
setup<00:04:02.579> you<00:04:03.570> can<00:04:03.690> easily<00:04:03.870> hit<00:04:04.079> for<00:04:04.320> energies

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
setup you can easily hit for energies

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.150 
setup you can easily hit for energies
and<00:04:04.829> hit<00:04:04.950> with<00:04:05.040> black<00:04:05.310> hair<00:04:05.609> and<00:04:06.950> two<00:04:07.950> tool

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
and hit with black hair and two tool

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.340 
and hit with black hair and two tool
scrappers<00:04:08.609> just<00:04:08.940> to<00:04:09.060> get<00:04:09.209> a<00:04:09.239> counter<00:04:09.989> garbodor

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
scrappers just to get a counter garbodor

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.309 
scrappers just to get a counter garbodor
it's<00:04:10.620> not<00:04:10.739> really<00:04:11.040> helpful<00:04:11.640> otherwise<00:04:12.319> you

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
it's not really helpful otherwise you

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:14.690 
it's not really helpful otherwise you
normally<00:04:13.590> just<00:04:13.680> tend<00:04:13.890> to<00:04:13.950> one-shot<00:04:14.190> anything

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
normally just tend to one-shot anything

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.130 
normally just tend to one-shot anything
that's<00:04:14.850> active<00:04:15.239> so<00:04:15.420> it's<00:04:15.540> not<00:04:15.660> really<00:04:15.720> helpful

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
that's active so it's not really helpful

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.810 
that's active so it's not really helpful
against<00:04:16.470> like<00:04:16.769> G<00:04:16.979> booster<00:04:17.340> and<00:04:17.519> things<00:04:17.669> like

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
against like G booster and things like

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.060 
against like G booster and things like
that<00:04:17.930> but<00:04:18.930> against<00:04:19.289> garbodor<00:04:19.650> this<00:04:19.950> is

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
that but against garbodor this is

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.229 
that but against garbodor this is
absolutely<00:04:20.430> crucial<00:04:20.640> and<00:04:20.880> that<00:04:21.000> was<00:04:21.090> one<00:04:21.209> of

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
absolutely crucial and that was one of

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.310 
absolutely crucial and that was one of
the<00:04:21.329> main<00:04:21.390> reasons<00:04:21.690> i<00:04:21.750> ran<00:04:21.900> dowsing<00:04:22.289> machine

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
the main reasons i ran dowsing machine

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.110 
the main reasons i ran dowsing machine
was<00:04:22.800> so<00:04:22.889> they<00:04:23.010> could<00:04:23.190> pick<00:04:23.370> this<00:04:23.550> up<00:04:23.610> later<00:04:23.850> if

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
was so they could pick this up later if

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.590 
was so they could pick this up later if
I<00:04:24.180> needed<00:04:24.389> to<00:04:24.630> but<00:04:25.039> it's<00:04:26.039> just<00:04:26.280> better<00:04:26.430> to<00:04:26.600> just

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
I needed to but it's just better to just

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.600 
I needed to but it's just better to just
have<00:04:27.660> computer<00:04:28.530> search<00:04:28.740> one<00:04:29.430> flat<00:04:29.700> stone

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
have computer search one flat stone

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.730 
have computer search one flat stone
just<00:04:31.330> because<00:04:31.629> it<00:04:31.930> also<00:04:32.050> helps<00:04:32.319> people<00:04:32.590> waste

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
just because it also helps people waste

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.020 
just because it also helps people waste
up<00:04:33.000> their<00:04:34.000> tools<00:04:34.569> wrappers<00:04:35.310> and<00:04:36.310> you<00:04:36.909> can

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
up their tools wrappers and you can

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.429 
up their tools wrappers and you can
always<00:04:37.210> give<00:04:37.330> Kelly<00:04:37.569> oh<00:04:37.689> free<00:04:37.870> retreat<00:04:38.229> or

00:04:38.429 --> 00:04:38.439 
always give Kelly oh free retreat or

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:40.950 
always give Kelly oh free retreat or
just<00:04:38.800> I<00:04:39.090> use<00:04:40.090> it<00:04:40.210> to<00:04:40.300> empty<00:04:40.479> a<00:04:40.509> card<00:04:40.750> in<00:04:40.870> my<00:04:40.930> hand

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
just I use it to empty a card in my hand

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.010 
just I use it to empty a card in my hand
it's<00:04:41.439> about<00:04:41.650> it<00:04:42.180> to<00:04:43.180> lightnings<00:04:43.659> I<00:04:43.870> could

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
it's about it to lightnings I could

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.480 
it's about it to lightnings I could
probably<00:04:44.199> go<00:04:44.379> three<00:04:44.800> but<00:04:45.069> instead<00:04:45.310> someone

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
probably go three but instead someone

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.159 
probably go three but instead someone
writing<00:04:45.729> to<00:04:45.939> black<00:04:46.210> here<00:04:46.449> and<00:04:46.629> I<00:04:46.780> filled<00:04:46.990> it<00:04:47.139> to

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
writing to black here and I filled it to

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:49.110 
writing to black here and I filled it to
is<00:04:47.530> up<00:04:47.830> the<00:04:47.979> most<00:04:48.159> i<00:04:48.280> want<00:04:48.490> normally<00:04:48.969> they're

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
is up the most i want normally they're

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.510 
is up the most i want normally they're
not<00:04:49.270> both<00:04:49.629> prized<00:04:50.139> so<00:04:50.620> it's<00:04:50.770> not<00:04:50.919> that<00:04:51.280> big<00:04:51.460> of

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
not both prized so it's not that big of

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.320 
not both prized so it's not that big of
a<00:04:51.669> deal<00:04:51.849> and<00:04:53.009> nine<00:04:54.009> water<00:04:54.280> energies<00:04:54.699> because

a deal and nine water energies because

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.170 
a deal and nine water energies because
otherwise<00:04:55.659> the<00:04:55.930> deck<00:04:56.080> just<00:04:56.229> doesn't<00:04:56.560> work<00:04:56.650> I

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
otherwise the deck just doesn't work I

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.420 
otherwise the deck just doesn't work I
don't<00:04:58.180> hit<00:04:58.509> huge<00:04:58.990> damage<00:04:59.289> as<00:04:59.590> Calvillo<00:05:00.009> like<00:05:00.310> I

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
don't hit huge damage as Calvillo like I

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.249 
don't hit huge damage as Calvillo like I
used<00:05:00.669> to<00:05:00.759> when<00:05:00.849> I<00:05:01.030> mean<00:05:01.210> like<00:05:01.300> I<00:05:01.419> think<00:05:01.599> 12<00:05:02.080> or

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:02.259 
used to when I mean like I think 12 or

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:05.879 
used to when I mean like I think 12 or
13<00:05:02.710> water<00:05:02.979> energies<00:05:03.840> but<00:05:04.840> again<00:05:05.349> Brizzy<00:05:05.770> on

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 
13 water energies but again Brizzy on

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:07.559 
13 water energies but again Brizzy on
kind<00:05:06.250> of<00:05:06.400> just<00:05:06.580> craps<00:05:06.909> on<00:05:07.120> you<00:05:07.300> if<00:05:07.419> you<00:05:07.449> just

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:07.569 
kind of just craps on you if you just

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:09.990 
kind of just craps on you if you just
run<00:05:07.930> flat<00:05:08.650> Keldeo<00:05:09.069> so<00:05:09.340> I<00:05:09.400> decided<00:05:09.699> against

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
run flat Keldeo so I decided against

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.309 
run flat Keldeo so I decided against
that<00:05:10.439> so<00:05:11.439> there's<00:05:12.009> that<00:05:12.300> slide<00:05:13.300> that<00:05:13.479> poorly

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:14.319 
that so there's that slide that poorly

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:16.709 
that so there's that slide that poorly
and<00:05:15.039> what<00:05:15.909> are<00:05:15.969> your<00:05:16.090> thoughts<00:05:16.240> on<00:05:16.449> the<00:05:16.539> deck

00:05:16.709 --> 00:05:16.719 
and what are your thoughts on the deck

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:19.649 
and what are your thoughts on the deck
overall<00:05:17.139> I<00:05:17.949> like<00:05:18.669> the<00:05:18.819> deck<00:05:19.029> if<00:05:19.270> I<00:05:19.389> was<00:05:19.509> going

00:05:19.649 --> 00:05:19.659 
overall I like the deck if I was going

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:20.850 
overall I like the deck if I was going
to<00:05:19.840> play<00:05:19.960> competitively<00:05:20.500> this<00:05:20.710> would

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
to play competitively this would

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.589 
to play competitively this would
probably<00:05:20.979> be<00:05:21.219> the<00:05:21.340> deck<00:05:21.580> that<00:05:22.120> I<00:05:22.150> would<00:05:22.389> play

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:22.599 
probably be the deck that I would play

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:24.209 
probably be the deck that I would play
especially<00:05:22.870> with<00:05:23.259> some<00:05:23.770> of<00:05:23.800> the<00:05:23.919> X&amp;Y

00:05:24.209 --> 00:05:24.219 
especially with some of the X&amp;Y

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:25.860 
especially with some of the X&amp;Y
revelations<00:05:24.909> there's<00:05:25.120> a<00:05:25.150> lot<00:05:25.300> of<00:05:25.330> cards<00:05:25.779> that

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
revelations there's a lot of cards that

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.550 
revelations there's a lot of cards that
really<00:05:26.139> help<00:05:26.349> this<00:05:26.469> deck<00:05:26.710> out<00:05:26.889> like

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
really help this deck out like

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.420 
really help this deck out like
professors<00:05:29.560> letter<00:05:29.770> which<00:05:30.009> is<00:05:30.129> basically

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
professors letter which is basically
