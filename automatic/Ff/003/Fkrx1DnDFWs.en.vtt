did this a little bit close to the
police<00:00:34.860> impound<00:00:35.550> so<00:00:36.420> there's<00:00:36.809> probably<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.110> lot

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
police impound so there's probably a lot

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.290 
police impound so there's probably a lot
of<00:00:37.320> our<00:00:37.380> officers<00:00:37.680> around<00:00:37.980> me<00:00:38.129> but<00:00:39.120> that's

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
of our officers around me but that's

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.360 
of our officers around me but that's
fine<00:00:39.450> so<00:00:40.050> we'll<00:00:40.320> just<00:00:40.379> get<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.399> car<00:00:41.670> here<00:00:41.940> and

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
fine so we'll just get a car here and

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.450 
fine so we'll just get a car here and
make<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.399> her<00:00:44.610> xscape<00:00:45.020> slowly<00:00:46.129> okay<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.160> got<00:00:47.309> this

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
make a her xscape slowly okay I got this

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.819 
make a her xscape slowly okay I got this
Oh<00:00:49.730> hopefully<00:00:51.260> but<00:00:52.260> yeah<00:00:52.410> we<00:00:52.530> should<00:00:52.559> be<00:00:52.770> able

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
Oh hopefully but yeah we should be able

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.000 
Oh hopefully but yeah we should be able
to<00:00:52.980> make<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.129> pretty<00:00:54.110> pretty<00:00:55.110> Swift<00:00:55.530> escape

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
to make a pretty pretty Swift escape

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.520 
to make a pretty pretty Swift escape
here<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.309> would<00:00:56.460> think<00:00:57.230> shouldn't<00:00:58.230> be<00:00:58.289> too<00:00:58.320> hard

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
here I would think shouldn't be too hard

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.000 
here I would think shouldn't be too hard
to<00:00:58.770> get<00:00:58.949> away<00:01:00.410> especially<00:01:01.410> if<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:01.770> Drive<00:01:01.949> like

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
to get away especially if I Drive like

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.310 
to get away especially if I Drive like
that<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.340> guess<00:01:02.579> but<00:01:03.510> there's<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.870> cop<00:01:04.049> coming

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
that I guess but there's a cop coming

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.020 
that I guess but there's a cop coming
off<00:01:04.589> sat<00:01:04.890> way<00:01:05.040> there<00:01:05.339> that's<00:01:05.640> probably<00:01:05.880> won't

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
off sat way there that's probably won't

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.310 
off sat way there that's probably won't
see<00:01:06.270> me<00:01:06.830> somehow<00:01:07.830> not<00:01:09.170> come<00:01:10.170> over<00:01:10.439> this<00:01:10.650> way

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
see me somehow not come over this way

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.380 
see me somehow not come over this way
just<00:01:13.320> away<00:01:13.560> from<00:01:13.590> all<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.189> Lots<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:15.030> was<00:01:15.180> seeing

just away from all the Lots I was seeing

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.020 
just away from all the Lots I was seeing
and<00:01:15.600> they<00:01:15.720> would<00:01:15.869> go<00:01:16.009> away<00:01:17.009> from<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.430> cops<00:01:17.610> so

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
tail ah my words engine but still it's a

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.280

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:40.469 
hard if you're halfway decent giving

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:43.640 
hard if you're halfway decent giving
away<00:03:40.799> from<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.099> cops<00:03:41.280> I'm<00:03:41.549> not<00:03:41.790> and<00:03:42.260> if<00:03:43.260> I<00:03:43.409> can

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
know they can stay at one star which is

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:01.039 
know they can stay at one star which is
good<00:03:55.950> as<00:03:56.159> well<00:03:56.750> so<00:03:57.919> there's<00:03:58.919> always<00:03:59.280> that<00:04:00.049> I'm
