volumes a lot of coloristic value that
will<00:01:01.050> make<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:01.289> horn<00:01:01.530> very<00:01:01.770> very

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
will make this horn very very

my<00:01:14.460> first<00:01:14.730> request<00:01:15.180> in<00:01:15.420> making<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.260> good

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
my first request in making a good

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.950 
my first request in making a good
piccolo<00:01:17.190> trumpet<00:01:17.580> quite<00:01:17.790> frankly<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.450> the

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
piccolo trumpet quite frankly is the

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.800 
piccolo trumpet quite frankly is the
ability<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.620> hold<00:01:19.860> it<00:01:20.100> in<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.430> way<00:01:20.630> that<00:01:21.630> makes

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
ability to hold it in a way that makes

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.320 
ability to hold it in a way that makes
it<00:01:21.960> easy<00:01:22.230> for<00:01:22.350> all<00:01:22.680> types<00:01:23.550> of<00:01:23.730> hand<00:01:23.970> styles

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
it easy for all types of hand styles

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.180 
it easy for all types of hand styles
whether<00:01:24.480> you<00:01:24.570> have<00:01:24.720> large<00:01:24.990> hands<00:01:25.440> small<00:01:25.740> hands

the<00:01:29.400> design<00:01:29.670> concept<00:01:30.300> which<00:01:30.480> does<00:01:31.140> give<00:01:31.410> some

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
the design concept which does give some

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.320 
the design concept which does give some
some<00:01:32.070> latitude<00:01:32.550> for<00:01:32.729> where<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.940> thumb<00:01:33.150> is

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
some latitude for where the thumb is

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.270 
some latitude for where the thumb is
based<00:01:33.570> here<00:01:33.990> allows<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:34.830> to<00:01:34.920> hold<00:01:35.130> the

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
based here allows you to hold the

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.560 
based here allows you to hold the
instrument<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.700> number<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.090> different<00:01:36.420> ways

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
instrument a number of different ways

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.719 
instrument a number of different ways
which<00:01:36.900> are<00:01:37.020> comfortable<00:01:37.470> for<00:01:37.580> anybody<00:01:38.580> that

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
which are comfortable for anybody that

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:39.650 
which are comfortable for anybody that
wants<00:01:38.910> to<00:01:38.970> hold<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.240> perhaps<00:01:39.330> in<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.630> slightly

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
wants to hold it perhaps in a slightly

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.930 
wants to hold it perhaps in a slightly
different<00:01:39.960> manner<00:01:40.290> than<00:01:40.500> somebody<00:01:40.920> else<00:01:41.160> so

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
different manner than somebody else so

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.310 
different manner than somebody else so
that<00:01:41.970> was<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.210> very<00:01:42.450> very<00:01:42.570> important<00:01:43.080> design

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
that was a very very important design

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.410 
that was a very very important design
feature<00:01:44.040> in<00:01:44.370> coming<00:01:44.880> up<00:01:44.940> with<00:01:45.000> something<00:01:45.270> that

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
feature in coming up with something that

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.230 
feature in coming up with something that
was<00:01:45.570> balanced<00:01:46.050> in<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.320> hand<00:01:46.880> what<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:47.910> love

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
was balanced in the hand what I love

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.940 
was balanced in the hand what I love
about<00:01:48.509> this<00:01:48.780> piccolo<00:01:49.170> trumpet<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.740> fact

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
about this piccolo trumpet is the fact

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.070 
about this piccolo trumpet is the fact
that<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.160> has<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.340> lot<00:01:50.700> of<00:01:50.729> colors<00:01:51.360> especially

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
that it has a lot of colors especially

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.950 
that it has a lot of colors especially
between<00:01:52.530> pianist<00:01:53.100> ml<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.550> Metso<00:01:54.000> Forte<00:01:54.450> you

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
between pianist ml and Metso Forte you

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.450 
between pianist ml and Metso Forte you
don't<00:01:55.140> have<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.440> play<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.740> very<00:01:55.920> loud<00:01:56.160> to<00:01:56.190> get

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
don't have to play it very loud to get

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.760 
don't have to play it very loud to get
it<00:01:56.580> a<00:01:56.640> tremendously<00:01:57.180> interesting<00:01:57.500> range<00:01:58.500> of

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
it a tremendously interesting range of

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.469 
it a tremendously interesting range of
color<00:01:59.250> spectrum<00:01:59.700> out<00:01:59.790> of<00:01:59.880> the<00:01:59.940> instrument<00:02:00.180> and

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
color spectrum out of the instrument and

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.300 
color spectrum out of the instrument and
that's<00:02:00.660> something<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.200> think<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.710> more

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
that's something I think that is more

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.700 
that's something I think that is more
inherent<00:02:02.790> in<00:02:03.150> general<00:02:03.690> to<00:02:04.170> rotary<00:02:04.440> valve

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
inherent in general to rotary valve

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.170 
inherent in general to rotary valve
instruments<00:02:05.250> than<00:02:05.369> it<00:02:05.460> is<00:02:05.550> to<00:02:05.670> piston<00:02:05.970> valve

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
instruments than it is to piston valve

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.749 
instruments than it is to piston valve
horns<00:02:06.590> the<00:02:07.590> greatest<00:02:07.950> feature<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.459> sound

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
horns the greatest feature of the sound

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.900 
horns the greatest feature of the sound
again<00:02:09.690> would<00:02:09.929> be<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.530> number<00:02:11.009> of<00:02:11.250> colors<00:02:11.730> the

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
again would be the number of colors the

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.660 
again would be the number of colors the
overtones<00:02:12.480> that<00:02:12.810> it<00:02:12.959> really<00:02:13.200> gets<00:02:13.440> at<00:02:14.250> a

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
overtones that it really gets at a

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.870 
overtones that it really gets at a
softer<00:02:15.239> volume<00:02:15.660> quite<00:02:15.870> frankly<00:02:16.519> this<00:02:17.519> allows

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
softer volume quite frankly this allows

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.090 
softer volume quite frankly this allows
it<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.120> resonate<00:02:18.300> very<00:02:18.959> clearly<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:19.650> project

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
it to resonate very clearly and project
