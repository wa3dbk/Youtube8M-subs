00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.730
 dr 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.220
 here I know many of us like 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.840
 of coaches but I wanted to show a 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.580
 thing that happened here that is a 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.480
 care that we should have as I 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:25.920
 we work with woods like pinus 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.260
 ok I was freaking out here where our 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.330
 to be able to work some 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.559
 boxes were already in the last pieces already 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.360
 I had worked all day, it was not good. 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.980
 carelessness was actually working 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.920
 with which the tool in a manner 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.290
 correct 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:49.250
 holding the kieppe nam 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:52.680
 only that third pin to hand over 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.930
 the top of the wood already had 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.280
 taken the gods of the straight but look what 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:02.010
 happened the pin came in here and look where 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:06.149
 he was leaving and seeing if he got into the 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.850
 wood and linen clothes up 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:11.700
 he entered here are the second 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.030
 I had not noticed he entered 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:21.450
 here o 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:27.600
 That was why I left here. 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:30.060
 As soon as he leaves 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.570
 that's because I left it for you guys 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.689
 see the rope the direction of the oil 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.720
 wood remembering that who does not know 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.530
 pins this part here hopscotch is very 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.460
 hard 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.950
 Then the pin came in and he found the 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.850
 came then was its softer story 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:56.240
 and this holds up and not a line 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:02:02.280
 straight as it was to be done and just 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:04.590
 Awakening a model right here, good. 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.350
 Luckily I did not get hurt much. 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.990
 only a small spat as if 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.700
 was doing a 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:16.670
 a blood test there using those 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.700
 What makes me think glucose? 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.980
 finally glucose rate with only one 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.030
 stick on the finger but it stays there like a 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.330
 alert 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:29.090
 so is the plan really rose is a 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.290
 left completely out and another 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.920
 really sudden when you went to work 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.780
 with pins they have is these come to take 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.750
 be careful here the apron well 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.460
 very smooth rating was born with a 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.910
 so this was no problem but 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:46.580
 this is a lot of media for the 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.820
 yellow there it is dangerous so stay the 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.050
 alert exercise caution when it 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.320
 work with it 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.240
 It is true that I left unharmed but could 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.390
 really hurt me ugly here 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:03.070
 Some people are there warning you 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.070
 A hug, a good job for everyone.
