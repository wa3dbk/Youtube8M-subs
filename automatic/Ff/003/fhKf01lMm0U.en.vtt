00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:07.280
 or today they fight we are here in a 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.080
 commented video of padel filtres paying 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.839
 with near the views that we want 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:15.740
 for 24 good at least some points 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:18.769
 we would like everyone here I am 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.019
 accompanying in this commented video is 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:23.210
 a whole kind of what we would like 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:25.369
 that I had for fil 4 we started with 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.839
 a good the first point I want 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.179
 touch for example that I would like 

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:31.490
 is to be able to customize the character and 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.829
 that as you can see between we only have 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:38.289
 four pretty bases you can change a 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:41.289
 little what I put badly stamped the 

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:41.289
 camouflage 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:52.430
 Rosita does not allow to see with blue hair 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:54.800
 but image that you can put statues and 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.570
 if you can change the hat or you can 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.030
 put him as well as war wounds 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.449
 in the face a patch in the eye with a 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.449
 pirate 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:20.020
 the famous 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:37.280
 if that seems to me to be very good very 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.020
 good idea because right now the 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.000
 possibility of personalization are 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.020
 minimal even that this is a subject that 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.030
 good to evaluate me too but good 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.190
 of weapons the personalization of 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:57.440
 weapons even greater the colors as 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:02:00.740
 about the gender of what would be 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.140
 Many I am a girl I always have to 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.770
 endure to have a poor man tona and 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.770
 all my heart 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:15.290
 beautiful sexy imagine the truth is a 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.940
 very good idea the genre I think if I 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.950
 you think about the games of the 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.000
 massive multiplayer mode all 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.250
 welcome genders are all the time 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.959
 pursued by the three points and what 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.520
 I do not care, I lost you, they said 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:32.770
 'not many men who use 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.770
 problems that take 20 is one more option 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:47.200
 about the cinema that is something if the mode 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:53.599
 where you can play yourself and then this one 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:55.940
 loving when you are recording games 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.770
 typical the truth that I think it will be very 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.840
 good idea to include a cinema mode not only 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.150
 why but also because of the issue of 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.459
 you could be avoiding what 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.930
 then change the cameras so much yours 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.209
 like your friends if it's acting like 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.780
 with your companions and put the cameras 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.690
 in different points 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.920
 and could not be more edited clips 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.920
 same as for example 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.959
 I'm talking about youtube 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.520
 youtube in us that I always follow you 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.990
 have the bad luck that when I'm 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.360
 it's a good game it's recording and if it's 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.709
 the game has gone to take for sack but 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.690
 also for people you give on youtube 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.880
 brou what I would like very much to take out 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.560
 good things and power us 3 friends unit 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.209
 because it is what great happiness is and 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.040
 clinical trials of every new 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.630
 generation of consoles that are supposed to 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.840
 you will be able to upload content directly 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.640
 to youtube according to what will connect you 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.530
 a girl and I think that even that 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.820
 facebook and those things have though not 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.620
 I'm doing youtube, you can show off 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.280
 we friends as there through 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.550
 of all these virtual networks 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.550
 next to that 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.410
 would be seen near the animations and 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.380
 show a lot that I put some animations 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:07.680
 again he's going to say four how to get on 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.030
 to a car that can know how to see the 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.580
 animation of the character getting on the 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.500
 car watching at the door or changing the 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.970
 weapon 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:18.620
 and that kind of ex discs is not a bad one 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.299
 idea the truth put more animations 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.130
 still in fact in the videos that have 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.870
 removed because I could see more or less 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.000
 have not changed much the animations of 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.070
 recharge the weapon and as they are 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.720
 same as in 3 so it would not be bad 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.210
 include some other animation what 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.520
 yes it would be very good also included 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.230
 animations when it shoots you 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:40.120
 overhead that kind of thing you do not die 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.120
 how do you move good 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:52.130
 well it would not be bad promised you take a 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:57.080
 little that kind of more realistic things 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:58.610
 but really this one where the bullet is 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:03.230
 affected but not if you have the hand that 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:05.090
 have at hand but it does cost more 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.460
 point for example and if they have a foot 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.830
 I'm going to leave limping you can not run 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.480
 I also do not know that kind of things are more 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.220
 complex and it would give us a lot of half me 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.540
 I would really like these animations and if 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:16.540
 Tehran an eye on his part 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.240
 very good because that's basically to see 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.790
 finally I like to see the aim 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.620
 Realistically simply that well follow 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:34.970
 keep improving that they want a 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:36.710
 point and let it be the same as 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.840
 depending on who has a kind of 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.890
 recognition of zones and seconds from 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.890
 where has the shovel 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.650
 I would all look for them and when you guys 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.320
 I hope this has really been our 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:53.090
 small list very small list more 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.380
 go ahead let's see let's do another 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.910
 to see other points 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.920
 in the disaster channel so they are 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.870
 to the slope are more than anything what we 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.850
 would like to see in going to say 4 now to 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.680
 tell us what you would like for you and 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:05.630
 get to the second I do not know if the second 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.550
 part another reflection surely in my 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.860
 channel soon I say goodbye happy to esther and 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.750
 thank you for inviting me again and 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.840
 good thank you for your company and we 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:16.610
 we see the next but before disaster 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.150
 greets us 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.150
 one
