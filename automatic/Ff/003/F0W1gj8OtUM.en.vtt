performance trio 3 0 s so this is the

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.150 
performance trio 3 0 s so this is the
wheel<00:00:12.660> right<00:00:13.259> here<00:00:15.529> it's<00:00:16.529> really<00:00:16.740> nice<00:00:16.920> real

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
Hobbit's pool and I'll leave in drag and

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.080 
Hobbit's pool and I'll leave in drag and
some<00:00:44.520> heavy-duty<00:00:44.760> solid<00:00:45.300> aluminum<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.989> as<00:00:46.289> I

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090 
some heavy-duty solid aluminum and as I

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.400 
some heavy-duty solid aluminum and as I
fall<00:00:48.090> watt<00:00:48.329> or<00:00:48.539> bail<00:00:48.870> wire<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:50.960> yeah<00:00:51.960> they<00:00:52.199> get

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
fall watt or bail wire and yeah they get

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.240 
fall watt or bail wire and yeah they get
racially<00:00:53.010> six<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.399> one<00:00:53.520> so<00:00:54.890> that's<00:00:55.890> pretty

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
racially six to one so that's pretty

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:03.439 
racially six to one so that's pretty
good<00:00:56.489> because<00:00:57.770> my<00:00:58.969> old<00:00:59.969> reel<00:01:00.270> is<00:01:00.510> only<00:01:02.449> this

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
good because my old reel is only this

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.939 
good because my old reel is only this
can<00:01:03.719> be<00:01:03.870> show<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.170> only<00:01:04.290> five<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.799> one<00:01:04.920> I

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
can be show is only five to one I

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:05.830 
can be show is only five to one I
believe<00:01:05.309> yeah

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
believe yeah

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:13.370 
believe yeah
five<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:07.049> one<00:01:07.080> so<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.189> was<00:01:08.340> my<00:01:11.869> old<00:01:12.869> one<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.140> got

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
five to one so that was my old one I got

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.420 
five to one so that was my old one I got
a<00:01:13.409> while<00:01:13.770> though<00:01:14.750> yeah<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.110> one<00:01:16.320> it's<00:01:17.310> not

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
a while though yeah so that one it's not

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.590 
a while though yeah so that one it's not
that<00:01:17.640> good<00:01:17.820> compared<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:18.450> one<00:01:20.240> so<00:01:21.240> just

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
that good compared to this one so just

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.580 
that good compared to this one so just
do<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.439> close<00:01:22.710> up<00:01:22.939> this<00:01:23.939> reel

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
do a close up this reel

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.020 
do a close up this reel
so<00:01:25.590> as<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:26.040> can<00:01:26.189> see<00:01:27.710> there's<00:01:28.790> this<00:01:29.790> is<00:01:29.939> how

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
so as you can see there's this is how

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.109

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
have a folder for my log case as you can

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.039 
have a folder for my log case as you can
see<00:01:36.950> just<00:01:37.950> ten<00:01:38.250> right<00:01:38.430> there<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.850> then<00:01:39.049> have
