00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
of a deer browsing on a plant you can

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.229 
of a deer browsing on a plant you can
see<00:00:56.410> there<00:00:56.620> that<00:00:56.649> the<00:00:57.070> it<00:00:57.670> almost<00:00:57.879> looks<00:00:58.149> like

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
see there that the it almost looks like

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.630 
see there that the it almost looks like
a<00:00:58.420> really<00:00:59.260> bad<00:00:59.980> cut<00:01:00.489> on<00:01:01.800> on<00:01:02.800> the<00:01:02.980> shrub<00:01:03.280> this

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
looks like a rough cut that somebody

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.830 
looks like a rough cut that somebody
came<00:01:17.979> in<00:01:18.130> with<00:01:18.250> like<00:01:18.280> a<00:01:18.430> really<00:01:18.579> sharp<00:01:19.420> Saul

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
came in with like a really sharp Saul

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.530 
came in with like a really sharp Saul
and<00:01:20.049> tried<00:01:20.259> to<00:01:20.409> to<00:01:21.159> Saul<00:01:21.400> off<00:01:21.610> the<00:01:21.850> ends<00:01:22.360> of<00:01:22.450> the

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
and tried to to Saul off the ends of the

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.120 
and tried to to Saul off the ends of the
stem<00:01:22.840> so<00:01:23.079> that<00:01:23.259> that's<00:01:23.439> how<00:01:23.680> you<00:01:23.740> can<00:01:23.920> tell<00:01:23.950> if

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
stem so that that's how you can tell if

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.700 
stem so that that's how you can tell if
deer<00:01:25.000> and<00:01:25.360> browsing<00:01:25.840> on<00:01:25.960> it<00:01:26.140> the<00:01:26.290> other<00:01:26.409> issue

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
deer and browsing on it the other issue

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.310 
deer and browsing on it the other issue
here<00:01:27.130> is<00:01:27.310> because<00:01:27.909> of<00:01:28.119> these<00:01:28.390> these<00:01:29.020> large

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
here is because of these these large

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.880 
here is because of these these large
trees<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:30.909> lot<00:01:31.570> of<00:01:31.689> times<00:01:31.869> what<00:01:32.079> happens<00:01:32.259> is

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
trees a lot of times what happens is

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.330 
trees a lot of times what happens is
that<00:01:33.159> it<00:01:33.579> soaks<00:01:34.060> up<00:01:34.329> a<00:01:34.509> lot<00:01:34.659> of<00:01:34.810> the<00:01:35.340> nutrients

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
that it soaks up a lot of the nutrients

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.530 
that it soaks up a lot of the nutrients
and<00:01:36.670> it<00:01:37.000> affects<00:01:37.390> the<00:01:37.689> pH<00:01:38.020> levels<00:01:38.530> and<00:01:38.979> such<00:01:39.540> in

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
and it affects the pH levels and such in

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.350 
and it affects the pH levels and such in
beds<00:01:40.869> like<00:01:41.140> this<00:01:41.380> so<00:01:41.560> the<00:01:41.680> other<00:01:41.829> thing<00:01:41.920> that

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
beds like this so the other thing that

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.870 
beds like this so the other thing that
Christopher<00:01:43.360> landscaping<00:01:44.140> does<00:01:45.009> is<00:01:45.340> come<00:01:45.670> in

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
Christopher landscaping does is come in

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.600 
Christopher landscaping does is come in
before<00:01:46.509> we<00:01:46.930> plant<00:01:47.290> any<00:01:47.500> plans<00:01:47.920> we<00:01:48.070> do<00:01:48.340> take<00:01:48.579> a

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
before we plant any plans we do take a

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.340 
before we plant any plans we do take a
soil<00:01:48.909> sample<00:01:49.299> to<00:01:49.659> test<00:01:49.840> the<00:01:50.049> pH<00:01:50.380> levels

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
soil sample to test the pH levels

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.840 
soil sample to test the pH levels
nutrient<00:01:53.350> levels<00:01:53.680> nitrogen<00:01:54.340> phosphorus

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
nutrient levels nitrogen phosphorus

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.749 
nutrient levels nitrogen phosphorus
potassium<00:01:55.590> other<00:01:56.610> micronutrients<00:01:57.610> and

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
potassium other micronutrients and

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.319 
potassium other micronutrients and
macronutrients<00:01:58.079> that<00:01:59.280> ensures<00:02:00.280> you<00:02:00.670> whatever

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
macronutrients that ensures you whatever

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:03.179 
macronutrients that ensures you whatever
plants<00:02:01.810> that<00:02:01.930> we<00:02:02.049> do<00:02:02.229> put<00:02:02.469> in<00:02:02.649> is<00:02:02.829> going<00:02:03.039> to

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
plants that we do put in is going to

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:08.160 
plants that we do put in is going to
thrive<00:02:03.850> and<00:02:04.270> look<00:02:04.659> healthy<00:02:05.140> and<00:02:06.840> grow<00:02:07.840> the<00:02:08.050> way

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
thrive and look healthy and grow the way

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.110 
thrive and look healthy and grow the way
they're<00:02:08.380> supposed<00:02:08.410> to<00:02:08.890> grow<00:02:09.190> and<00:02:09.399> not<00:02:09.580> to<00:02:09.940> give

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:10.120 
they're supposed to grow and not to give

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.630 
they're supposed to grow and not to give
you<00:02:10.270> conditions<00:02:10.990> like<00:02:11.260> we<00:02:12.040> have<00:02:12.190> here<00:02:12.490> is

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
you conditions like we have here is

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.810 
you conditions like we have here is
another<00:02:12.940> example<00:02:13.270> of<00:02:13.690> a<00:02:14.200> deer<00:02:15.040> browse<00:02:15.340> plant

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
another example of a deer browse plant

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.840 
another example of a deer browse plant
that<00:02:16.590> essentially<00:02:17.590> just<00:02:18.160> killed<00:02:18.430> the<00:02:18.550> plant

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
that essentially just killed the plant

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.380 
that essentially just killed the plant
so<00:02:19.800> two<00:02:20.800> conditions<00:02:21.370> going<00:02:21.700> on<00:02:21.880> here<00:02:22.120> number

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
so two conditions going on here number
