00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.980
 mistakes in hindering trail that 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.410
 very often commit beginners 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.859
 but also the runners more 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:26.130
 experienced and so I leave you all 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.330
 immediately with fred in this video is 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.680
 well hello to all I welcome you 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.340
 for this first video in the massive 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.080
 of the estÃ©rel 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.350
 today we are going to talk about the five 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.309
 mistakes to avoid when starting on the 13th 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.350
 trade goals and how to equip 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.570
 properly and games on the trail are 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.700
 important they offer protection 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.050
 ankle and offers better grip 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.680
 better grip on the ground than 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.480
 running out 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.280
 so from the moment you hire 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.350
 on the discount and voronin trails of 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.030
 road in a closet 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.739
 one of the other mistakes would be to forget 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.969
 road sessions to run 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.370
 a long time you have to learn how to run 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.289
 quickly and the road helps maintain the 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.329
 quality of the stride we dream all in front 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.859
 him tmb or the diagonally crazy but 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.270
 learning running nature goes on 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.360
 by a gradual increase in 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.950
 mileage each season to be done 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.280
 pleasure and especially not to 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.130
 hurt 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.409
 so do not hesitate to get started 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.060
 register for races from 10 to 15 km a 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.640
 fourth error when we avoid the 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.960
 trail wants to forget to split from 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.000
 fraction of the trailer is taking place 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.470
 generally east coast but the nato 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.009
 cardio work that reinforcement 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.979
 muscular 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.689
 an example of a split session in 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.509
 coast would part to realize the famous 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.600
 30 30 or curves on the road in a 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.030
 well stiff hull and chain eight 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.680
 times thirty seconds at a steady pace 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.280
 it can be as much the race as the 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.530
 fast walk followed by 30 seconds of 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.720
 recovery slowly walking the 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.710
 trailer must vary the pleasures it is 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.329
 because you put in the trail that does not 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.579
 must practice that the trade do not hesitate 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.840
 not to hike to the via ferrata to 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.920
 register for snow races 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.560
 wade vertical km 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.720
 you practice a sport of nature 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.640
 which offers an extraordinary panel 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.549
 of activity enjoy it you will do 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.290
 progress here is this second video 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.210
