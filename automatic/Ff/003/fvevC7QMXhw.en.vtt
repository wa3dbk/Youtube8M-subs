00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.250
 we will continue when the blanket is 

00:00:01.729 --> 00:00:06.440
 patchwork of two sides as you see here 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.720
 we have the big one and here we have both 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.330
 first sides done now let's 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:14.420
 work this and this 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.010
 let's start we put the crochet where 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:20.530
 finished 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:24.100
 and we passed our thread we raised a 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:27.610
 two three and four three chains for 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:30.030
 lift and one to run a space and 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:33.030
 we start 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.030
 12 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.740
 a chain we leave this free and in the 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.340
 We are going to start hollow 1 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.340
 two 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.260
 we leave this free and we start in the 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:54.220
 next gap and so we will work 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.630
 how we did 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.310
 the previous color 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:03.080
 using the corner 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.080
 and continuing on the other side 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.470
 chain 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.200
 a 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.240
 two 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.420
 3 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.170
 chain 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.360
 a 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.930
 two 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.490
 and 3 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.670
 na 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.240
 one 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.240
 two 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:36.230
 we make one more chain and in the corner 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.230
 we work three whole 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:44.100
 three chains and three in three 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.640
 and we continue with the side that follows us 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:59.040
 and we end up on this side here so we go 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.870
 to repeat for five rows from 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.960
 there and we are changing the color 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:06.300
 following the sequence to be able 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.630
 finish our blanket see how well 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.630
 remains
