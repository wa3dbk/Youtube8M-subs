00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
different products depending I usually

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.330 
different products depending I usually
try<00:02:56.940> to<00:02:57.030> go<00:02:57.270> for<00:02:57.540> toners<00:02:57.989> over<00:02:58.470> something<00:02:59.310> like

try to go for toners over something like

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.580 
try to go for toners over something like
an<00:02:59.550> astringent<00:02:59.850> because<00:03:00.450> my<00:03:00.600> skin<00:03:00.780> is<00:03:00.840> dry<00:03:01.290> and

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
an astringent because my skin is dry and

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.910 
an astringent because my skin is dry and
toners<00:03:01.950> are<00:03:02.510> more<00:03:03.510> gentle<00:03:03.870> on<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.290> skin<00:03:04.500> but<00:03:04.860> I

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
toners are more gentle on the skin but I

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.590 
toners are more gentle on the skin but I
find<00:03:05.160> that<00:03:05.310> this<00:03:05.520> works<00:03:05.820> even<00:03:06.000> better<00:03:06.150> than

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
find that this works even better than

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.350 
find that this works even better than
your<00:03:06.750> average<00:03:06.870> like<00:03:07.320> average<00:03:07.980> toner<00:03:08.459> after

your average like average toner after
that<00:03:09.630> I<00:03:09.870> use<00:03:10.640> clinique's<00:03:11.840> dramatically

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
that I use clinique's dramatically

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.740 
that I use clinique's dramatically

different moisturizing lotion and this

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.190 
different moisturizing lotion and this
is<00:03:18.900> nice<00:03:19.140> because<00:03:19.560> it's<00:03:20.209> thick<00:03:21.209> enough<00:03:21.239> or<00:03:22.170> i

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
is nice because it's thick enough or i

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
whole face it's really moisturizing but

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:36.199 
whole face it's really moisturizing but
not<00:03:29.519> too<00:03:29.700> heavy<00:03:29.930> and<00:03:32.090> if<00:03:33.090> i'm<00:03:33.750> not<00:03:33.930> going<00:03:35.090> to<00:03:36.090> be

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
not too heavy and if i'm not going to be

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.130 
not too heavy and if i'm not going to be
out<00:03:37.100> in<00:03:38.100> the<00:03:38.400> Sun<00:03:38.640> a<00:03:38.670> lot<00:03:38.910> i'll<00:03:39.239> just<00:03:39.660> use<00:03:39.750> this

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
out in the Sun a lot i'll just use this

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.680 
out in the Sun a lot i'll just use this

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
but if i'm going to be out in the sun

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.280 
but if i'm going to be out in the sun
i'll<00:03:42.690> use<00:03:43.250> the<00:03:44.250> eucerin<00:03:45.090> everyday<00:03:45.660> protection

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
i'll use the eucerin everyday protection

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.360 
i'll use the eucerin everyday protection
face<00:03:46.620> lotion<00:03:47.130> in<00:03:47.370> SPF<00:03:47.910> 30<00:03:48.360> and<00:03:48.920> i<00:03:49.920> usually<00:03:50.340> just

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
face lotion in SPF 30 and i usually just

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.300 
face lotion in SPF 30 and i usually just
combine<00:03:51.000> these<00:03:51.239> two<00:03:51.540> together<00:03:51.750> and<00:03:52.230> I<00:03:53.070> think

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
combine these two together and I think

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.880 
combine these two together and I think
it<00:03:53.430> works<00:03:53.670> really<00:03:53.790> well<00:03:54.120> to<00:03:54.720> provide<00:03:55.680> some

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
it works really well to provide some

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.550 
it works really well to provide some
protection<00:03:56.010> but<00:03:56.430> also<00:03:56.640> a<00:03:57.120> nice<00:03:58.049> level<00:03:58.290> of

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
protection but also a nice level of

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.770 
protection but also a nice level of
moisture<00:03:58.799> for<00:03:59.190> my<00:03:59.310> skin<00:03:59.750> and<00:04:01.880> for<00:04:02.880> eye<00:04:02.910> cream<00:04:03.480> I

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
moisture for my skin and for eye cream I

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.150 
moisture for my skin and for eye cream I
use<00:04:04.650> Clinique<00:04:05.310> all<00:04:05.880> about<00:04:06.690> eyes<00:04:06.900> and<00:04:07.860> this<00:04:07.980> is

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
use Clinique all about eyes and this is

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
use Clinique all about eyes and this is
a<00:04:08.190> really<00:04:08.580> nice<00:04:08.850> cream<00:04:09.780> gel<00:04:10.850> formula<00:04:11.850> and<00:04:12.090> I

heavy<00:04:14.640> under<00:04:14.970> my<00:04:15.090> eyes<00:04:15.239> because<00:04:15.570> I<00:04:15.720> don't<00:04:15.989> have

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
heavy under my eyes because I don't have

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.569 
heavy under my eyes because I don't have
any<00:04:16.440> anti<00:04:17.180> aging<00:04:18.180> wrinkle<00:04:18.690> needs<00:04:19.470> it's<00:04:19.950> just

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
any anti aging wrinkle needs it's just

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:25.370 
any anti aging wrinkle needs it's just
primarily<00:04:21.450> to<00:04:21.840> moisturize<00:04:22.440> so<00:04:23.340> I<00:04:23.930> like<00:04:24.930> to<00:04:24.960> use

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
primarily to moisturize so I like to use

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.559 
primarily to moisturize so I like to use
that<00:04:25.740> so<00:04:26.700> at<00:04:27.150> the<00:04:27.390> end<00:04:27.419> of<00:04:27.660> the<00:04:27.780> day

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:28.569 
that so at the end of the day

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:31.019 
that so at the end of the day
I<00:04:28.749> want<00:04:29.319> to<00:04:29.379> take<00:04:29.559> my<00:04:29.740> makeup<00:04:29.889> off<00:04:30.249> and<00:04:30.309> cleanse

used multiple types of makeup removers
and<00:04:44.589> I<00:04:44.649> find<00:04:44.889> that<00:04:45.069> this<00:04:45.279> one<00:04:45.520> works<00:04:45.759> the<00:04:45.879> best

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
and I find that this one works the best

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:49.739 
and I find that this one works the best
but<00:04:47.169> really<00:04:47.589> gets<00:04:47.919> dark<00:04:48.699> makeup<00:04:49.119> a<00:04:49.419> lot<00:04:49.599> of

julius it's like not going anywhere and
this<00:06:48.250> is<00:06:48.490> so<00:06:49.680> thick<00:06:50.680> that<00:06:50.949> I<00:06:51.729> really<00:06:52.599> use<00:06:52.870> it<00:06:53.080> on

00:06:57.089 --> 00:06:57.099 
its own I will take a little bit of this

00:06:57.099 --> 00:07:00.800 
its own I will take a little bit of this
and<00:06:57.490> then<00:06:58.419> mix<00:06:58.870> it<00:06:59.080> in<00:06:59.379> with<00:06:59.680> the<00:07:00.129> Clinique

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:00.810 
and then mix it in with the Clinique

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:02.999 
and then mix it in with the Clinique
dramatically<00:07:01.810> different<00:07:02.020> lotion<00:07:02.590> to<00:07:02.740> kind<00:07:02.949> of

00:07:02.999 --> 00:07:03.009 
dramatically different lotion to kind of

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:05.580 
dramatically different lotion to kind of
thin<00:07:03.250> it<00:07:03.370> out<00:07:03.460> a<00:07:03.520> little<00:07:03.699> bit<00:07:03.939> and<00:07:04.210> I<00:07:05.080> think

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:05.590 
thin it out a little bit and I think

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:08.459 
thin it out a little bit and I think
that<00:07:05.740> that<00:07:05.770> provides<00:07:06.490> enough<00:07:07.050> moisture<00:07:08.050> for

00:07:08.459 --> 00:07:08.469 
that that provides enough moisture for

00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:12.510 
that that provides enough moisture for
me<00:07:08.650> so<00:07:09.430> that's<00:07:09.580> my<00:07:09.909> skincare<00:07:10.360> routine<00:07:11.370> let<00:07:12.370> me
