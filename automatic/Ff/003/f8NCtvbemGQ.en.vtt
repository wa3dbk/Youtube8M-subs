Mountain aesthetic is something that I
think<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.510> unique<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:58.020> Canada<00:00:58.440> as<00:00:58.559> well

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
think is unique to Canada as well

this project has been fantastic to build

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.670 
this project has been fantastic to build
your<00:01:04.030> own<00:01:04.059> home<00:01:04.390> to<00:01:04.690> build<00:01:04.900> your<00:01:05.080> own<00:01:05.140> design

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
your own home to build your own design

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.040 
your own home to build your own design
teaches<00:01:06.490> you<00:01:06.640> more<00:01:06.820> about<00:01:07.119> design<00:01:07.510> and<00:01:07.869> new

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
teaches you more about design and new

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.570 
teaches you more about design and new
technologies<00:01:08.770> and<00:01:09.010> integrating

technologies and integrating

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.030 
technologies and integrating
technologies<00:01:10.270> then<00:01:10.960> the<00:01:11.470> classroom<00:01:11.890> ever

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
technologies then the classroom ever

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.010 
technologies then the classroom ever
could<00:01:12.280> I<00:01:12.520> think<00:01:12.700> it's<00:01:13.000> critical<00:01:13.479> for<00:01:13.659> students

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
could I think it's critical for students

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.320 
could I think it's critical for students
to<00:01:14.200> learn<00:01:14.350> this<00:01:14.619> stuff<00:01:14.740> because<00:01:15.159> this<00:01:15.369> is<00:01:15.580> not

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
to learn this stuff because this is not

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.090 
to learn this stuff because this is not
a<00:01:16.630> trend<00:01:16.960> this<00:01:17.290> is<00:01:17.470> the<00:01:17.619> wave<00:01:17.770> of<00:01:17.800> the<00:01:18.070> future
