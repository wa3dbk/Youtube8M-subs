00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.920
 good in this video we will see 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.900
 how to set up mobilization 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.160
 in terms of server windows server 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:20.470
 2008 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.279
 first we go to the beginning 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.790
 then we look at tools 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:28.669
 administrative and we're going to finish 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:32.950
 service and finally we're going to 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:32.950
 service terminal configuration 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:44.870
 we can see where it says group of 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.680
 edit configuration we can see in the 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.350
 licenses tab 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.330
 and the terminal license mode 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.690
 servers at this time in this team 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:58.480
 is configured by users ie 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.370
 it will not be used to assign licenses 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.220
 by users to the teams that want 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.660
 disconnect to finish zeros 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.030
 This model and science is very 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.550
 important to have them configured from 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.170
 correct way since if it is not 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.550
 configured correctly or not 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.200
 coincide with the license that we 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:19.180
 we have acquired we will not be able to access 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.649
 to the service of terminating network by 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.899
 example if we acquire licenses for 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:25.240
 user and the mobilization of 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:26.649
 terminal server is per client 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.540
 the licenses acquired are not going to 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:31.840
 work for that we must be careful 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.370
 that the mobilization coincides 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.770
 with the licenses that we have acquired 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:40.360
 to change in license mode or 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:44.120
 we press double click in this section 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.640
 since it will appear in the models 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.830
 in which we have to choose 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.270
 devices or by user we select 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.230
 the one that matches the licenses that 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:56.510
 we write and finally we tell them 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:58.640
 accept with this we will have to configure 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.930
 be socially determined model 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.930
 thank you
