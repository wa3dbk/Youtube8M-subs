00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:51.560 
chamber it's gonna be a just like the

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.790 
chamber it's gonna be a just like the
jump<00:00:51.890> to<00:00:52.130> 425<00:00:52.880> thousand<00:00:53.510> feet<00:00:53.660> except<00:00:54.620> there's

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
jump to 425 thousand feet except there's

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.340 
jump to 425 thousand feet except there's
not<00:00:54.950> gonna<00:00:55.070> be<00:00:55.160> a<00:00:55.309> balloon<00:00:55.730> lifting<00:00:56.450> him<00:00:56.660> and

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
not gonna be a balloon lifting him and

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.630 
not gonna be a balloon lifting him and
he's<00:00:57.470> not<00:00:57.680> falling<00:00:57.980> through<00:00:58.370> the<00:00:58.400> real

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640

he's not falling through the real
atmosphere<00:01:00.460> inside<00:01:01.460> that<00:01:01.700> chamber<00:01:02.050> um<00:01:03.050> this

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
atmosphere inside that chamber um this

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.079 
atmosphere inside that chamber um this
is<00:01:03.559> a<00:01:03.590> really<00:01:03.650> hostile<00:01:04.280> environment<00:01:04.820> it's

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
is a really hostile environment it's

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:06.930 
is a really hostile environment it's
it's<00:01:05.210> dangerous<00:01:05.600> even<00:01:05.869> if<00:01:06.410> it<00:01:06.500> doesn't<00:01:06.680> look

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
it's dangerous even if it doesn't look

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.190 
it's dangerous even if it doesn't look
dangerous<00:01:07.940> because<00:01:08.330> you<00:01:08.540> cannot<00:01:08.840> see<00:01:09.080> the
