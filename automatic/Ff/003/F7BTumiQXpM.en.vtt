it<00:04:58.460> is<00:04:58.610> entirely<00:04:59.030> possible<00:04:59.210> to<00:04:59.900> go<00:05:00.050> out<00:05:00.140> into

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
it is entirely possible to go out into

it is entirely possible to go out into

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
three feet of snow on the ground and dig

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.470 
three feet of snow on the ground and dig
carrots<00:05:06.410> nice<00:05:07.070> carrots<00:05:07.550> right<00:05:08.180> out<00:05:08.300> of<00:05:08.330> the

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:08.480 
carrots nice carrots right out of the

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.460 
carrots nice carrots right out of the
ground<00:05:08.770> but<00:05:09.770> it's<00:05:10.580> a<00:05:10.700> lot<00:05:10.880> of<00:05:11.000> work<00:05:11.210> so<00:05:11.840> that

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
ground but it's a lot of work so that

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.940 
ground but it's a lot of work so that
may<00:05:12.740> not<00:05:12.770> be<00:05:12.980> the<00:05:13.700> best<00:05:13.880> solution<00:05:14.330> in<00:05:14.840> fact<00:05:15.560> I

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
may not be the best solution in fact I

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:17.350 
may not be the best solution in fact I
think<00:05:16.250> it's<00:05:16.520> probably<00:05:16.760> not<00:05:16.940> the<00:05:17.090> best

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
think it's probably not the best

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.440 
think it's probably not the best
solution<00:05:17.800> certainly<00:05:18.800> not<00:05:18.980> for<00:05:19.250> me<00:05:19.490> I<00:05:19.700> think<00:05:20.150> a

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.450 
solution certainly not for me I think a

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:25.000 
solution certainly not for me I think a
better<00:05:20.690> solution<00:05:21.170> is<00:05:21.820> to<00:05:22.820> make<00:05:23.450> the<00:05:23.930> leaf<00:05:24.680> bag

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 
better solution is to make the leaf bag

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.400 
better solution is to make the leaf bag
clamps<00:05:25.700> which<00:05:26.030> I<00:05:26.210> show<00:05:26.420> in<00:05:26.540> another<00:05:26.630> video

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
clamps which I show in another video

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.630 
clamps which I show in another video
those<00:05:28.340> make<00:05:29.090> sense<00:05:29.450> to<00:05:29.660> me<00:05:29.780> because<00:05:30.500> I<00:05:30.830> can<00:05:31.400> dig

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:31.640 
those make sense to me because I can dig

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.640 
those make sense to me because I can dig
the<00:05:31.760> carrots<00:05:32.120> in<00:05:32.210> the<00:05:32.300> fall<00:05:32.570> put<00:05:33.380> them<00:05:33.500> into

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
the carrots in the fall put them into

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.800 
the carrots in the fall put them into
the<00:05:33.800> leaf<00:05:33.980> bag<00:05:34.220> clamp<00:05:34.700> and<00:05:34.940> they're<00:05:35.390> not<00:05:35.540> way

the leaf bag clamp and they're not way

the leaf bag clamp and they're not way

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
off out in my garden I can put them

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.850 
off out in my garden I can put them
right<00:05:38.210> on<00:05:38.330> the<00:05:38.510> edge<00:05:38.630> of<00:05:38.780> my<00:05:38.840> garden<00:05:39.350> where

they're readily accessible already dug
would<00:05:42.500> be<00:05:42.740> a<00:05:43.070> very<00:05:43.370> simple<00:05:43.700> way<00:05:43.970> without<00:05:44.630> a
