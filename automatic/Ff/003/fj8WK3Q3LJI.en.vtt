00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:08.429
 Hi there, this is mega navigator today 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:12.269
 we look at the smartphone from the company hold 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:16.940
 called r8 do this smartphone 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:20.070
 ip67 protected 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:26.210
 which makes it possible to immerse it on 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:29.189
 depth up to 1 meter within 30 seconds 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.279
 also this smartphone stand 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:37.399
 falling from height 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:45.260
 a meter and a half so this box means 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:45.260
 SUV SUV phone assembled by China 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.239
 brief technical information 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:06.530
 bag shipping film 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.080
 see the contents 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.970
 warranty card 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.300
 user's manual 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:35.600
 one note here's the tip he's 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.960
 so long 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.180
 it is made to cable 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.890
 the protected building quietly entered 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:50.869
 the smartphone from and the tip itself will be short 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:53.899
 For example, here is such a charge, which 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:02:05.619
 on the right , this smartphone is simply not 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:02:09.590
 fit body will interfere with the rear cover 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:12.250
 bolts have a stop that is not 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.250
 will get lost 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:26.440
 headphones are the easiest clips holder 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:37.720
 such a simple built-in headphones 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.720
 microphone you can talk 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:03:06.440
 charging for 500 milliamps means 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:03:08.140
 1800 capacity battery and screwdriver 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.060
 smartphone immediately 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:15.440
 supports two sim cards memory card 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:18.710
 I tried 64 gigabytes 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:22.880
 There are no problems, then immediately a double circuit 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:25.900
 silicone seals go away and hinders 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.900
 water penetration 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:47.440
 the end will not twist means 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.440
 turn on 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:22.450
 it means the screen itself is diagonal three with 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:25.780
 half inch resolution 240 by 320 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:29.500
 points but a little central protect 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:34.530
 mt 65-75 processor from and one core 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:39.610
 1 gigahertz video accelerator powervr 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:43.030
 531 but the stuffing let's say so far from the idea 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:49.800
 from ideal means the smartphone is functioning 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:53.010
 running android os 4.0 4 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:57.270
 pretty old version given that 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:05:00.880
 manufacturer company is positioning 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:04.200
 This smartphone as a novelty means 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:07.420
 RAM 512 megabytes 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:10.800
 permanent also 512 megabytes availability 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:13.660
 memory cards necessarily otherwise without it 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:16.420
 the camera will not work and save 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.910
 photos simply nowhere will mean 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:21.520
 when installing a memory card is available 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:27.580
 opportunity to put all applications of the game 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:31.060
 on the card itself that such an interface 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:35.230
 there is, as it were, all the standard special quickly 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:41.710
 act this smartphone brag 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:45.700
 can not 14 look back cover 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:49.750
 side camera 5 megapixels flash 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:53.650
 speaker but the quality of the pictures is very 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:56.320
 mediocre quality but here I am not 5 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:59.890
 probably 13 from the force that is autofocus and 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:07.540
 no strong noises under all conditions 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:11.500
 shooting means plug where earphone 3 5 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:15.010
 millimeter again gum with double 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:22.620
 seal contour means keys 

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:30.850
 volume control micro usb connector 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:35.920
 also with double seal contour 9 

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:40.470
 bolts on the base of three from the right and 

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:43.060
 left side one on top 2 bottom 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:45.670
 connects the two halves of the smartphone 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:47.340
 it means the orange insert is plastic 

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:52.140
 polycarbonate 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:57.190
 black inserts this hard rubber 

00:06:52.140 --> 00:07:00.730
 corrugated back cover 

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:04.390
 speaker camera inside megapixels 

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:08.170
 proximity sensor lighting sensor but 

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:12.540
 touch control buttons are enough 

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:16.410
 light 123 grams keep it in your hand 

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:16.410
 comfortable enough and comfortable 

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:27.389
 the bolts pull tight so what 

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:30.330
 moisture penetration 

00:07:27.389 --> 00:07:35.850
 I think we are not threatened but again we are 

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:38.190
 check out the test location 

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:43.919
 touch buttons a little non-standard 

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:46.320
 context menu why so back key 

00:07:43.919 --> 00:07:48.660
 or brought home to the left, which is not 

00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:50.880
 quite comfortable it would be logical 

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:53.270
 place in the middle i have to 

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.270
 get used to 

00:07:54.770 --> 00:08:00.660
 Well, such a smartphone for games is not at all 

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:03.080
 intended that is only the most 

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.080
 simple 

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.050
 thanks for that
