00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.800 

well<00:01:23.290> I<00:01:23.680> think<00:01:23.740> from<00:01:24.549> all<00:01:25.119> the<00:01:25.420> beautiful

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
well I think from all the beautiful

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:26.310 
well I think from all the beautiful
stuff

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
stuff

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.289 
stuff
the<00:01:26.530> people<00:01:26.920> here<00:01:27.100> are<00:01:27.220> not<00:01:27.430> pretty<00:01:27.670> well<00:01:28.030> I've

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:28.299 
the people here are not pretty well I've

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:31.590 
the people here are not pretty well I've
been<00:01:28.650> suspicious<00:01:29.650> of<00:01:30.070> it<00:01:30.280> we<00:01:30.759> may<00:01:31.030> have<00:01:31.299> done

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
been suspicious of it we may have done

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.680 
been suspicious of it we may have done
this<00:01:31.810> before<00:01:32.049> but<00:01:32.640> he<00:01:33.640> has<00:01:33.880> a<00:01:33.909> little<00:01:34.509> basic

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
this before but he has a little basic

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:42.850 
this before but he has a little basic
stuff

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.250 

when<00:01:43.010> the<00:01:43.160> break<00:01:43.400> didn't<00:01:43.850> last<00:01:44.030> long<00:01:44.690> soon<00:01:45.020> we

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:45.260 
when the break didn't last long soon we

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:53.310 
when the break didn't last long soon we
look<00:01:45.440> back<00:01:45.680> on<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:46.010> floor

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.390 

I<00:01:54.600> think<00:01:55.600> I've<00:01:55.750> made<00:01:55.870> a<00:01:55.930> few<00:01:56.140> mistakes<00:01:56.260> but<00:01:57.190> she

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
I think I've made a few mistakes but she

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.620 
I think I've made a few mistakes but she
corrected<00:01:57.910> me<00:01:58.030> and<00:01:58.300> then<00:01:59.260> I<00:01:59.590> started<00:02:00.160> to<00:02:00.630> feel

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
corrected me and then I started to feel

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.170 
corrected me and then I started to feel
the<00:02:01.870> rhythm<00:02:02.050> and<00:02:02.470> then<00:02:02.860> I<00:02:03.430> all<00:02:03.640> picked<00:02:03.910> it<00:02:04.060> up

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
the rhythm and then I all picked it up

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.230 
the rhythm and then I all picked it up
and<00:02:04.980> she<00:02:05.980> showed<00:02:06.220> she<00:02:06.520> showed<00:02:06.730> me<00:02:06.760> the<00:02:06.970> little

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
and she showed she showed me the little

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.350 
and she showed she showed me the little
bits<00:02:07.450> adding<00:02:08.259> on<00:02:08.410> about<00:02:08.740> shoulder<00:02:09.460> shape<00:02:09.700> and

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
bits adding on about shoulder shape and

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:25.380 
bits adding on about shoulder shape and
all<00:02:10.960> that<00:02:11.910> so<00:02:12.910> I<00:02:13.620> think<00:02:14.620> I<00:02:14.920> didn't<00:02:15.520> know<00:02:24.390> salsa

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
all that so I think I didn't know salsa

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.170 
all that so I think I didn't know salsa
is<00:02:25.600> a<00:02:25.630> slot<00:02:26.080> or<00:02:26.350> spot<00:02:26.740> dance<00:02:27.040> leading<00:02:27.760> partners

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
is a slot or spot dance leading partners

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.390 
is a slot or spot dance leading partners
generally<00:02:28.750> occupy<00:02:29.230> a<00:02:29.260> fixed<00:02:29.770> area<00:02:29.980> on<00:02:30.280> the

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
generally occupy a fixed area on the

generally occupy a fixed area on the
dance<00:02:30.610> floor<00:02:30.780> rotating<00:02:31.780> around<00:02:31.900> each<00:02:32.200> other

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
dance floor rotating around each other

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.140 
dance floor rotating around each other
and<00:02:32.650> switching<00:02:33.130> places<00:02:33.340> instead<00:02:33.910> of

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
and switching places instead of

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.100 
and switching places instead of
traveling<00:02:34.630> over<00:02:34.990> the<00:02:35.020> floor<00:02:36.810> covering<00:02:37.810> stage

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
traveling over the floor covering stage

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:45.090 
traveling over the floor covering stage
space<00:02:38.530> is<00:02:38.800> a<00:02:38.830> feature<00:02:39.160> of<00:02:39.310> salsa<00:02:39.700> performances

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.130 

well<00:02:46.100> the<00:02:46.370> reason<00:02:46.730> I<00:02:46.850> dance<00:02:47.150> is<00:02:47.480> it<00:02:47.780> just<00:02:47.959> makes

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
well the reason I dance is it just makes

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.850 
well the reason I dance is it just makes
me<00:02:48.319> happy

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
me happy

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.210 
me happy
and<00:02:49.010> if<00:02:49.670> I'm<00:02:49.850> happy<00:02:50.120> and<00:02:50.620> stressed<00:02:51.620> out<00:02:51.830> most

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
and if I'm happy and stressed out most

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.460 
and if I'm happy and stressed out most
of<00:02:52.430> those<00:02:52.640> students<00:02:53.330> who<00:02:53.540> come<00:02:53.780> to<00:02:53.959> my<00:02:54.110> class

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
of those students who come to my class

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.720 
of those students who come to my class
are<00:02:55.540> between<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:56.780> age<00:02:56.930> groups<00:02:57.230> of<00:02:57.530> 21<00:02:58.130> and<00:02:58.280> 30

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
are between the age groups of 21 and 30

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.270 
are between the age groups of 21 and 30
so<00:02:59.180> it's<00:02:59.569> typically<00:03:00.260> a<00:03:00.380> working<00:03:00.890> population

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
so it's typically a working population

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.930 
so it's typically a working population
that<00:03:01.940> come<00:03:02.150> to<00:03:02.330> my<00:03:02.450> class<00:03:02.750> and<00:03:02.780> and<00:03:03.490> almost<00:03:04.490> all

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
that come to my class and and almost all

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.030 
that come to my class and and almost all
of<00:03:05.090> them<00:03:05.240> coming<00:03:05.480> straight<00:03:05.870> from<00:03:06.110> door<00:03:06.410> 90<00:03:07.010> I

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
of them coming straight from door 90 I

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.940 
of them coming straight from door 90 I
think<00:03:07.430> it's<00:03:07.640> a<00:03:07.730> great<00:03:07.970> stress<00:03:08.330> faster<00:03:08.950> and

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
think it's a great stress faster and

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.010 
think it's a great stress faster and
physically<00:03:10.580> a<00:03:10.670> lot<00:03:10.880> of<00:03:11.030> people<00:03:11.390> coming<00:03:11.780> to

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
physically a lot of people coming to

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.949 
physically a lot of people coming to
this<00:03:12.170> lose<00:03:12.470> weight<00:03:12.860> because<00:03:13.209> it's<00:03:14.209> amazing

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
this lose weight because it's amazing

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.890 
this lose weight because it's amazing
cardio<00:03:15.380> so<00:03:15.980> it's<00:03:16.580> a<00:03:16.820> good<00:03:16.970> workout<00:03:17.450> failure

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
cardio so it's a good workout failure

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.150 
cardio so it's a good workout failure

to<00:04:19.860> what<00:04:20.040> is<00:04:20.489> disjoint<00:04:20.930> see<00:04:21.930> how<00:04:22.140> it<00:04:22.320> goes<00:04:22.530> with

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
to what is disjoint see how it goes with

to what is disjoint see how it goes with
average<00:04:23.190> I<00:04:23.310> can<00:04:23.490> do<00:04:23.670> and<00:04:24.090> show<00:04:24.360> our<00:04:24.510> to<00:04:24.750> be<00:04:24.810> able

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.959 

so<00:04:37.330> now<00:04:37.539> the<00:04:38.110> moment<00:04:38.590> of<00:04:38.710> truth<00:04:38.770> what<00:04:39.729> we've

00:04:39.959 --> 00:04:39.969 
so now the moment of truth what we've

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:42.179 
so now the moment of truth what we've
been<00:04:40.180> waiting<00:04:40.389> for<00:04:40.569> the<00:04:41.199> time<00:04:41.439> for<00:04:41.740> Daniel<00:04:42.159> to

00:04:42.179 --> 00:04:42.189 
been waiting for the time for Daniel to

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:53.220 
been waiting for the time for Daniel to
the<00:04:42.370> top<00:04:42.669> see<00:04:43.330> what<00:04:43.539> he's<00:04:43.659> learned<00:04:43.900> today

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:55.680 

the<00:04:54.100> nerves<00:04:54.370> seem<00:04:54.730> to<00:04:54.880> be<00:04:55.000> setting<00:04:55.360> in<00:04:55.480> for

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
the nerves seem to be setting in for

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.990 
the nerves seem to be setting in for
Daniel<00:04:56.020> but<00:04:56.620> it<00:04:56.740> was<00:04:56.860> time<00:04:57.100> to<00:04:57.160> put<00:04:57.550> all<00:04:57.760> that

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
Daniel but it was time to put all that

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:20.460 
Daniel but it was time to put all that
aside<00:04:58.180> and<00:04:58.960> into<00:04:59.470> solvers

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.700 

I<00:05:20.500> think<00:05:21.190> he<00:05:21.340> has<00:05:21.460> a<00:05:21.490> really<00:05:21.850> strong<00:05:22.210> me<00:05:22.930> and

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
I think he has a really strong me and

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.590 
I think he has a really strong me and
salsa<00:05:24.550> is<00:05:24.610> all<00:05:24.910> about<00:05:26.220> the<00:05:27.220> man<00:05:27.430> leading<00:05:27.880> lady

salsa is all about the man leading lady

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.200 
so really in two spots and amongst

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.330 
so really in two spots and amongst
believers<00:05:32.200> so<00:05:32.920> we<00:05:33.760> had<00:05:33.880> a<00:05:33.910> really<00:05:34.150> nice<00:05:34.480> from
