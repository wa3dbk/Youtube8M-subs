00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
you can see my nozzle printing with my

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:18.400 
you can see my nozzle printing with my
special<00:00:11.460> new<00:00:11.610> polycarbonate<00:00:15.109> 275<00:00:16.109> degree<00:00:16.500> C

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
special new polycarbonate 275 degree C

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.580 
special new polycarbonate 275 degree C
the<00:00:19.410> polycarbonate<00:00:20.189> itself<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:21.150> very<00:00:21.900> very

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
the polycarbonate itself is very very

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.009 
the polycarbonate itself is very very
good<00:00:22.949> material<00:00:23.189> I<00:00:24.560> love<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:26.240> it<00:00:27.240> is<00:00:27.449> tough<00:00:27.720> as

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
good material I love it it is tough as

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.179 
good material I love it it is tough as
hell<00:00:28.849> it<00:00:29.849> prints<00:00:30.269> very<00:00:30.480> nicely<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:31.679> doesn't

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
hell it prints very nicely it doesn't

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.459 
hell it prints very nicely it doesn't
smell<00:00:32.489> at<00:00:32.640> all<00:00:32.730> well<00:00:33.120> at<00:00:33.329> least<00:00:33.510> this<00:00:33.960> one<00:00:34.260> I

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
smell at all well at least this one I

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.049 
smell at all well at least this one I
have<00:00:34.950> right<00:00:35.550> now<00:00:36.500> it<00:00:37.500> has<00:00:37.680> beautiful<00:00:38.059> bloody

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
have right now it has beautiful bloody

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.580 
have right now it has beautiful bloody
color<00:00:39.590> and<00:00:41.329> I<00:00:42.329> didn't<00:00:43.020> really<00:00:43.140> love<00:00:43.410> it

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
color and I didn't really love it

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.389 
color and I didn't really love it
because<00:00:43.980> this<00:00:44.250> single<00:00:44.670> wall<00:00:44.820> print<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:46.399> stuff

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
because this single wall print is stuff

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:54.139 
because this single wall print is stuff
as<00:00:47.789> like<00:00:48.750> three<00:00:49.140> four<00:00:49.530> walls<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:50.820> ABS<00:00:52.160> but<00:00:53.160> it

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
as like three four walls of ABS but it

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.959 
as like three four walls of ABS but it
still<00:00:54.510> has<00:00:55.070> one<00:00:57.170> disadvantage<00:00:58.340> because<00:00:59.340> the

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
still has one disadvantage because the

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.330 
still has one disadvantage because the
polycarbonate<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.960> very<00:01:01.379> hygroscopic

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
polycarbonate is very hygroscopic

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.830 
polycarbonate is very hygroscopic
material<00:01:04.129> that<00:01:05.129> means<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.390> sucks

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
material that means that it sucks

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.950 
material that means that it sucks
moisture<00:01:07.200> from<00:01:08.030> from<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.210> air<00:01:09.920> and<00:01:11.960> that

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
moisture from from the air and that

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:20.450 
moisture from from the air and that
produces<00:01:17.479> prints<00:01:18.479> because<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.979> moisture

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
produces prints because the moisture

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.940 
produces prints because the moisture
inside<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.270> plastic<00:01:21.509> expands<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.619> creates

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
inside the plastic expands and creates

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.820 
inside the plastic expands and creates
small<00:01:23.250> bubbles<00:01:23.630> but<00:01:24.630> as<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.170> can<00:01:25.320> see<00:01:25.590> this

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
small bubbles but as you can see this

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.890 
small bubbles but as you can see this
print<00:01:26.990> doesn't<00:01:27.990> have<00:01:28.350> this<00:01:28.619> problem

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
print doesn't have this problem

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.150 
print doesn't have this problem
sorry<00:01:30.830> for<00:01:31.070> the<00:01:31.220> light<00:01:32.830> sorry<00:01:33.830> for<00:01:34.040> the

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
sorry for the light sorry for the

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.340 
sorry for the light sorry for the
lighting<00:01:34.340> but<00:01:34.820> it<00:01:35.240> it<00:01:35.690> had<00:01:35.870> a<00:01:35.900> general

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
lighting but it it had a general

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.580 
lighting but it it had a general
appearance<00:01:36.740> of<00:01:37.120> PLA<00:01:38.150> so<00:01:38.750> it's<00:01:38.900> very<00:01:39.050> brittle

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
appearance of PLA so it's very brittle

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.010 
appearance of PLA so it's very brittle
and<00:01:39.770> it<00:01:40.010> looks<00:01:40.310> bad<00:01:40.760> on<00:01:41.060> camera<00:01:41.630> it's<00:01:41.930> not

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
and it looks bad on camera it's not

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.550 
and it looks bad on camera it's not
lighted<00:01:42.500> properly<00:01:43.000> and<00:01:44.320> I<00:01:45.610> had<00:01:46.610> to<00:01:46.790> solve<00:01:47.090> this

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
lighted properly and I had to solve this

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.140 
lighted properly and I had to solve this
and<00:01:48.880> yesterday

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
and yesterday

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.760 
and yesterday
I<00:01:50.180> created<00:01:51.970> just<00:01:52.970> in<00:01:53.240> time<00:01:53.770> dehydration

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
I created just in time dehydration

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.770 
I created just in time dehydration
device<00:01:55.570> which<00:01:56.570> is<00:01:56.750> basically<00:01:57.230> heated<00:01:57.680> PTFE<00:01:58.250> q

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
device which is basically heated PTFE q

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.850 
device which is basically heated PTFE q
and<00:01:59.780> when<00:02:00.110> I<00:02:00.260> come<00:02:00.470> back<00:02:00.680> you<00:02:01.190> can<00:02:01.370> see<00:02:01.640> it<00:02:01.760> here

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
and when I come back you can see it here

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:09.720 
and when I come back you can see it here
it<00:02:03.860> goes<00:02:05.920> back<00:02:06.920> to<00:02:07.100> my<00:02:07.220> spool<00:02:07.550> over<00:02:07.790> there<00:02:08.500> and

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:09.730 
it goes back to my spool over there and

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:15.730 
it goes back to my spool over there and
basically<00:02:10.930> inside<00:02:11.930> is<00:02:12.260> heated<00:02:12.800> up<00:02:13.490> to<00:02:14.740> 122

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
basically inside is heated up to 122

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.280 
basically inside is heated up to 122
degree<00:02:16.190> C<00:02:16.430> which<00:02:17.150> is<00:02:17.360> still<00:02:17.690> fine<00:02:17.990> for

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
degree C which is still fine for

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.430 
degree C which is still fine for
polycarbonate<00:02:18.950> and<00:02:19.720> it<00:02:20.720> takes<00:02:21.110> I<00:02:21.650> guess<00:02:23.440> 3040

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
polycarbonate and it takes I guess 3040

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.510 
polycarbonate and it takes I guess 3040
minutes<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:26.390> go<00:02:26.600> through<00:02:26.990> this<00:02:27.370> through<00:02:28.370> this

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
minutes to go through this through this

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.410 
minutes to go through this through this
piece<00:02:28.970> of<00:02:29.240> heated<00:02:29.540> tube<00:02:29.750> so<00:02:30.620> all<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.580> water

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
piece of heated tube so all the water

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.870 
piece of heated tube so all the water
evaporates<00:02:33.070> and<00:02:35.440> you<00:02:36.440> can<00:02:36.650> see<00:02:36.980> right<00:02:37.820> here

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
evaporates and you can see right here

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:48.550 
evaporates and you can see right here
that<00:02:41.320> the<00:02:42.320> water<00:02:42.590> actually<00:02:43.360> condensate<00:02:44.360> on<00:02:47.560> to

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
that the water actually condensate on to

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.100 
that the water actually condensate on to
pin<00:02:48.800> sides<00:02:49.780> where<00:02:50.780> it's<00:02:51.200> not<00:02:51.680> heated<00:02:52.130> I<00:02:53.110> will

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
pin sides where it's not heated I will

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:03.400 
pin sides where it's not heated I will
probably<00:02:54.380> cut<00:02:54.830> someone's<00:02:55.370> here<00:02:55.850> so<00:02:59.380> there<00:03:02.410> so

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
probably cut someone's here so there so

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:10.180 
probably cut someone's here so there so
overall<00:03:03.770> I'm<00:03:04.580> very<00:03:04.640> excited<00:03:05.360> about<00:03:05.570> this<00:03:09.190> I'm

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
overall I'm very excited about this I'm

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.560 
overall I'm very excited about this I'm
really<00:03:10.730> happy<00:03:11.360> because<00:03:12.820> yesterday<00:03:13.820> I've<00:03:14.150> got

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
really happy because yesterday I've got

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.220 
really happy because yesterday I've got
information<00:03:14.989> about<00:03:15.590> the<00:03:15.920> final<00:03:16.430> batch<00:03:17.230> of

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
information about the final batch of

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.449 
information about the final batch of
those<00:03:18.650> little<00:03:19.130> suckers

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
those little suckers

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.349 
those little suckers
I<00:03:20.870> should<00:03:21.870> receive<00:03:22.349> one<00:03:22.650> hundred<00:03:23.120> point<00:03:24.120> five

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
I should receive one hundred point five

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:29.539 
I should receive one hundred point five
millimeter<00:03:24.930> and<00:03:26.900> 100<00:03:27.900> open<00:03:28.049> 35<00:03:29.010> millimeter

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
millimeter and 100 open 35 millimeter

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.539 
millimeter and 100 open 35 millimeter
nozzles<00:03:30.090> so<00:03:30.870> we<00:03:31.260> can<00:03:31.469> finally<00:03:31.980> start<00:03:32.280> chipping

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
nozzles so we can finally start chipping

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:36.380 
nozzles so we can finally start chipping
those<00:03:32.909> I<00:03:33.319> still<00:03:34.319> need<00:03:34.500> to<00:03:34.620> get<00:03:35.120> some<00:03:36.120> more

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
those I still need to get some more

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.379 
those I still need to get some more
thermistors<00:03:37.139> but<00:03:37.530> that<00:03:37.980> should<00:03:38.219> be<00:03:38.400> piece<00:03:39.209> of

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
thermistors but that should be piece of
