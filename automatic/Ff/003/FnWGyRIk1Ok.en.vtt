00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.570 

so<00:01:55.600> once<00:01:55.780> i<00:01:55.900> was<00:01:55.990> done<00:01:56.050> going<00:01:56.410> on<00:01:56.680> all<00:01:56.980> the<00:01:57.220> pans

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
so once i was done going on all the pans

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.430 
so once i was done going on all the pans
this<00:01:58.270> is<00:01:58.420> what<00:01:58.600> it<00:01:58.690> turned<00:01:58.930> out<00:01:59.020> to<00:01:59.260> look<00:01:59.380> like

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
this is what it turned out to look like

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.250 
this is what it turned out to look like
so<00:02:00.280> then<00:02:00.430> i<00:02:00.490> just<00:02:00.670> took<00:02:01.060> my<00:02:01.240> blow<00:02:01.510> dryer<00:02:01.780> you

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.170 
so then i just took my blow dryer you
could<00:02:02.410> also<00:02:02.560> use<00:02:02.740> like<00:02:03.250> a<00:02:03.280> heat<00:02:03.580> gun<00:02:03.790> i<00:02:03.850> guess

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
could also use like a heat gun i guess

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.590 
could also use like a heat gun i guess
and<00:02:04.420> i<00:02:04.930> just<00:02:05.200> melted<00:02:05.710> the<00:02:05.890> crayons<00:02:06.370> by<00:02:06.970> tilting

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.210 
and i just melted the crayons by tilting
it<00:02:07.960> and<00:02:08.170> then<00:02:08.260> turning<00:02:08.500> it<00:02:08.649> on<00:02:08.710> the<00:02:08.860> blow<00:02:09.040> dryer
