00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.289
 first mount the knob 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.240
 put the blind on the window sill 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.130
 and align them laterally 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.850
 each one is distinguished 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.410
 outer edges 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:41.379
 turn the clamp carrier suitable for 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:43.809
 the casement to click the 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.309
 later caps off and screw 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.190
 you clamp the carrier on the open one 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.620
 window wing doing the outer edge of the 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.900
 Clamp wearer at the mark 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.460
 align 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.809
 first push the lower clamping 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.940
 shoes in the pinch carrier 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:02.080
 These are on the shorter line too 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.909
 detect the tension in the height 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.619
 the pinch carrier you see the cord 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:09.479
 punished and then mark the 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:11.710
 position of the clamp carrier on the cord 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.080
 tie the string to the knot 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.330
 drawn position and check it 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.250
 then whether the blind is horizontal 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.290
 hangs and moves well 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.580
 if necessary, change again 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.580
 the position of the knots 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.860
 cut the overhanging ends 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.600
 They push off above the new knot 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.340
 the spanning shoes in the pinch carrier and 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.340
 put on the cover caps 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.560
 Remove the banderoles use 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:54.680
 Do not be sharp or pointed 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:57.580
 her role is via jalousie 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.580
 now ready for use
