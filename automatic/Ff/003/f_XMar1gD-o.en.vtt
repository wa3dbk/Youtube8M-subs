in<00:00:48.020> this<00:00:48.170> video<00:00:48.590> I'm<00:00:49.400> going<00:00:49.610> to<00:00:49.730> show<00:00:49.970> you<00:00:50.000> the

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.330 
in this video I'm going to show you the

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.079 
in this video I'm going to show you the
difference<00:00:50.830> between<00:00:51.830> the<00:00:52.129> snow<00:00:52.460> blades<00:00:52.790> or

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089 
difference between the snow blades or

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:57.780 
difference between the snow blades or

Fisher the web the honest wise ones and

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:05.320 
Fisher the web the honest wise ones and
a<00:00:58.790> micro<00:00:59.269> sticks<00:01:02.680> both<00:01:03.680> skis<00:01:04.010> have<00:01:04.909> the<00:01:05.089> same

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
a micro sticks both skis have the same

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:06.160 
a micro sticks both skis have the same
measurements

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
measurements

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.380 
measurements
they're<00:01:07.070> both<00:01:07.630> 90<00:01:08.630> centimeters<00:01:09.290> long

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
they're both 90 centimeters long

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:16.870 
they're both 90 centimeters long
they<00:01:11.390> are<00:01:11.570> both<00:01:12.130> 105<00:01:14.110> 8095<00:01:15.250> so<00:01:16.250> that's<00:01:16.460> all<00:01:16.700> the

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
they are both 105 8095 so that's all the

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.469 
they are both 105 8095 so that's all the
same<00:01:17.260> what<00:01:18.260> is<00:01:18.470> a<00:01:18.530> big<00:01:18.950> difference<00:01:19.390> that's<00:01:20.390> the

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
same what is a big difference that's the

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.730 
same what is a big difference that's the
radius<00:01:21.190> the<00:01:22.190> web<00:01:22.460> the<00:01:23.330> other<00:01:23.570> skis<00:01:23.900> have<00:01:24.680> a

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
radius the web the other skis have a

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.200 
radius the web the other skis have a
radius<00:01:25.280> of<00:01:25.460> seven<00:01:26.380> the<00:01:27.380> Micro<00:01:27.829> sticks<00:01:28.210> have

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
radius of seven the Micro sticks have

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.850 
radius of seven the Micro sticks have
radius<00:01:29.780> of<00:01:30.520> four<00:01:31.520> points<00:01:32.030> one<00:01:32.450> so<00:01:33.439> that<00:01:33.590> makes

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
radius of four points one so that makes

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:41.249 
radius of four points one so that makes
the<00:01:34.820> micro<00:01:35.180> sticks<00:01:35.479> and<00:01:35.750> lost<00:01:36.320> easier<00:01:37.130> to<00:01:37.430> turn

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.920 

another<00:01:42.259> big<00:01:42.619> difference<00:01:42.859> is<00:01:43.430> the<00:01:43.490> height<00:01:44.420> of

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
another big difference is the height of

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:51.010 
another big difference is the height of
the<00:01:45.920> bindings<00:01:46.369> the<00:01:48.130> micro<00:01:49.130> sticks<00:01:50.020> binding

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
the bindings the micro sticks binding

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.980 
the bindings the micro sticks binding
you<00:01:51.799> can<00:01:51.979> see<00:01:52.189> it<00:01:52.340> it's<00:01:53.210> a<00:01:53.420> lot<00:01:53.689> higher<00:01:55.990> then

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
you can see it it's a lot higher then

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.690 
you can see it it's a lot higher then
the<00:01:57.109> bindings<00:01:57.590> of<00:01:58.549> the<00:01:58.759> web<00:02:00.280> that<00:02:01.280> makes<00:02:01.520> it

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
the bindings of the web that makes it

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.469 
the bindings of the web that makes it
easier<00:02:02.270> in<00:02:02.479> the<00:02:03.439> snow<00:02:03.789> when<00:02:04.789> your<00:02:04.969> shoe<00:02:05.210> is

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
easier in the snow when your shoe is

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.219 
easier in the snow when your shoe is
higher<00:02:06.170> and<00:02:06.530> you<00:02:07.280> go<00:02:07.429> coughing<00:02:07.789> you<00:02:08.750> won't<00:02:08.960> hit

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
higher and you go coughing you won't hit

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.300 
higher and you go coughing you won't hit
the<00:02:09.470> snow<00:02:10.060> so<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.270> micro<00:02:11.660> sticks<00:02:11.930> is<00:02:12.500> more<00:02:13.100> of

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
the snow so the micro sticks is more of

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:20.589 
the snow so the micro sticks is more of
a<00:02:13.460> carful<00:02:13.910> ski

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.330 

now<00:02:21.599> I'm<00:02:21.659> going<00:02:21.959> to<00:02:22.049> show<00:02:22.200> you<00:02:22.230> how<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:22.980> put

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
now I'm going to show you how to put

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:30.589 
now I'm going to show you how to put
them<00:02:23.459> up<00:02:26.959> you<00:02:27.959> lift<00:02:28.230> this<00:02:28.500> trip<00:02:29.450> hold<00:02:30.450> this

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
them up you lift this trip hold this

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.839 
them up you lift this trip hold this
thread<00:02:31.730> put<00:02:32.730> your<00:02:32.940> feet<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.629> the<00:02:33.750> back<00:02:34.849> and

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
thread put your feet to the back and

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:43.069 
thread put your feet to the back and
then<00:02:36.769> take<00:02:37.769> this<00:02:37.950> one<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:39.110> it's<00:02:40.110> done<00:02:42.079> another

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
then take this one and it's done another

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:48.289 
then take this one and it's done another
big<00:02:43.500> difference<00:02:44.750> it's<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.900> binding<00:02:46.970> one<00:02:47.970> is<00:02:48.239> a

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
big difference it's the binding one is a

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.819 
big difference it's the binding one is a
lot<00:02:48.659> easier<00:02:49.200> to<00:02:49.409> adjust<00:02:49.730> then<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.879> other<00:02:51.030> I

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:51.829 
lot easier to adjust then the other I

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:59.059 
lot easier to adjust then the other I
will<00:02:52.829> show<00:02:53.040> you<00:02:56.269> this<00:02:57.269> one<00:02:57.329> is<00:02:57.900> easier<00:02:58.620> it's

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
will show you this one is easier it's

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.849 
will show you this one is easier it's
the<00:02:59.280> red<00:02:59.810> it's<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.900> audience<00:03:01.200> want<00:03:02.359> to<00:03:03.359> adjust

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:03.859 
the red it's the audience want to adjust

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:10.190 
the red it's the audience want to adjust
simply<00:03:05.060> lift<00:03:06.060> this<00:03:06.299> one<00:03:06.590> and<00:03:07.590> then<00:03:07.829> I<00:03:09.200> can

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
simply lift this one and then I can

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.729 
simply lift this one and then I can
change<00:03:10.440> that<00:03:10.709> one<00:03:10.970> and<00:03:11.970> simply<00:03:12.480> put<00:03:13.379> it<00:03:13.409> back

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
change that one and simply put it back

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.440 
change that one and simply put it back
and<00:03:14.370> it's<00:03:15.239> adjusted<00:03:16.099> steady<00:03:17.099> easy<00:03:17.310> same<00:03:18.180> goes

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
and it's adjusted steady easy same goes

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.309 
and it's adjusted steady easy same goes
for<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.870> bed<00:03:19.940> the<00:03:20.940> small<00:03:21.359> arrow<00:03:21.629> here<00:03:21.959> that's

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
for the bed the small arrow here that's

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.580 
for the bed the small arrow here that's
the<00:03:22.440> middle<00:03:22.700> make<00:03:23.700> sure<00:03:24.109> get<00:03:25.109> the<00:03:25.230> arrow<00:03:25.410> on

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
the middle make sure get the arrow on

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:32.240 
the middle make sure get the arrow on
your<00:03:25.799> shoe<00:03:26.069> the<00:03:29.269> middle<00:03:30.919> that<00:03:31.919> they<00:03:32.040> are<00:03:32.130> the

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
your shoe the middle that they are the

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:39.909 
your shoe the middle that they are the
same<00:03:37.400> the<00:03:38.400> other<00:03:38.579> one<00:03:38.819> the<00:03:39.239> micro<00:03:39.599> sticks

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:39.919 
same the other one the micro sticks

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:42.979 
same the other one the micro sticks
that's<00:03:40.919> the<00:03:41.069> pain<00:03:41.310> in<00:03:41.459> the<00:03:41.579> ass<00:03:41.730> you<00:03:42.629> can't

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
that's the pain in the ass you can't

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.449 
that's the pain in the ass you can't
just<00:03:43.319> do<00:03:43.530> it<00:03:43.680> that<00:03:43.859> simple<00:03:44.329> you<00:03:45.329> need<00:03:45.540> a

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
just do it that simple you need a

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.199 
just do it that simple you need a
screwdriver<00:03:48.109> you<00:03:49.109> have<00:03:49.349> to<00:03:49.530> unscrew<00:03:50.209> these

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
screwdriver you have to unscrew these

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:56.539 
screwdriver you have to unscrew these
ones<00:03:52.669> four<00:03:53.669> of<00:03:53.849> them<00:03:54.769> then<00:03:55.769> you<00:03:55.799> can<00:03:56.190> remove

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
ones four of them then you can remove

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.509 
ones four of them then you can remove
adjust<00:03:57.239> this<00:03:57.690> one<00:03:57.959> then<00:03:58.889> you<00:03:59.069> screw<00:03:59.310> them<00:03:59.489> back

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
adjust this one then you screw them back

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.699 
adjust this one then you screw them back
and<00:04:00.030> then<00:04:01.019> you<00:04:01.590> do<00:04:01.739> the<00:04:01.859> same<00:04:02.099> to<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.090> unfold

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
and then you do the same to the unfold

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.000 
and then you do the same to the unfold
so<00:04:04.709> you<00:04:05.129> just<00:04:05.400> can't<00:04:05.760> go<00:04:06.000> skiing<00:04:06.810> and<00:04:07.349> then

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
so you just can't go skiing and then

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.949 
so you just can't go skiing and then
change<00:04:08.340> skis<00:04:08.669> with<00:04:08.910> some<00:04:09.120> other<00:04:09.269> person<00:04:09.540> and

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
change skis with some other person and

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.650 
change skis with some other person and
just<00:04:10.379> easily<00:04:10.709> adjust<00:04:11.400> it<00:04:11.609> it's<00:04:12.239> impossible

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
just easily adjust it it's impossible

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:19.189
