and<00:00:44.000> you<00:00:45.000> actually<00:00:45.149> need<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.899> run

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.150 

you

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.460 

you

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:57.470 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:05.119 

mom<00:00:57.590> where's<00:00:58.340> my

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.500 

you

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.920 

ok<00:01:08.510> so<00:01:08.570> I'm<00:01:08.840> going<00:01:08.990> to

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:21.200 

or

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.740 

you

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:38.110 

you

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.660 

um

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.830 

I'm<00:01:41.880> going<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.420> get<00:01:43.320> some<00:01:43.729> and<00:01:44.729> while<00:01:45.720> I'm

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
I'm going to get some and while I'm

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.190 
I'm going to get some and while I'm
doing<00:01:45.869> that<00:01:46.110> I'm<00:01:46.560> going<00:01:47.090> bill<00:01:48.090> d

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
doing that I'm going bill d

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:57.220 
doing that I'm going bill d
blocks<00:01:51.200> of<00:01:51.380> a<00:01:51.500> good

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.890 

you

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:16.200 

codeblocks

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.030 

you

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
you

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:25.160 
you
don't<00:02:19.000> have<00:02:19.209> enough<00:02:19.500> going<00:02:20.500> to<00:02:20.650> need<00:02:20.799> to<00:02:20.829> stick

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.089 

so<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:27.180> new<00:02:27.360> update<00:02:27.590> became<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.620> little<00:02:28.980> bit

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
so the new update became a little bit

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.910 
so the new update became a little bit
smaller<00:02:29.730> that<00:02:30.030> we<00:02:30.239> then<00:02:30.870> we<00:02:30.989> usually

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.380 

since

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:45.280 

and<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:40.220> reason<00:02:40.370> for<00:02:40.550> that<00:02:40.700> is<00:02:43.810> we<00:02:44.810> try<00:02:45.050> to<00:02:45.110> do

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
and the reason for that is we try to do

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.550 
and the reason for that is we try to do
some<00:02:45.500> experimental<00:02:46.070> features<00:02:46.630> that<00:02:47.630> was<00:02:48.290> not

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
some experimental features that was not

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.220 
some experimental features that was not
really<00:02:48.980> ready<00:02:49.460> to<00:02:49.610> be<00:02:49.910> added<00:02:50.420> to<00:02:50.570> release<00:02:50.990> yet

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
really ready to be added to release yet

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.320 
really ready to be added to release yet
I<00:02:51.500> will<00:02:51.890> probably<00:02:52.130> get<00:02:52.430> back<00:02:52.670> to<00:02:52.730> you<00:02:53.180> on<00:02:53.240> that

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
I will probably get back to you on that

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.710 
I will probably get back to you on that
one<00:02:53.720> in<00:02:53.930> a<00:02:54.200> future<00:02:54.530> release<00:02:55.270> so<00:02:56.270> here<00:02:56.480> we<00:02:56.690> have

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
one in a future release so here we have

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.250 
one in a future release so here we have
the<00:02:56.960> new<00:02:57.140> nether<00:02:57.740> reactor<00:02:57.980> core<00:02:58.460> and<00:02:58.810> it<00:02:59.810> costs

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
the new nether reactor core and it costs

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.920 
the new nether reactor core and it costs
free<00:03:00.620> diamonds<00:03:00.860> and<00:03:01.280> as<00:03:01.970> you<00:03:02.120> can<00:03:02.300> see<00:03:02.330> here<00:03:02.750> it

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
free diamonds and as you can see here it

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:10.000 
free diamonds and as you can see here it
costing<00:03:04.510> six<00:03:05.510> of<00:03:05.660> these<00:03:05.750> iron<00:03:06.050> ingots

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:19.580

going<00:03:47.970> to<00:03:48.090> build<00:03:48.390> the<00:03:48.840> reactor<00:03:49.379> the<00:03:49.890> left

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
going to build the reactor the left

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:54.410 
going to build the reactor the left
close<00:03:51.090> to<00:03:51.269> my<00:03:51.390> house<00:03:51.599> because<00:03:52.970> the<00:03:53.970> ice<00:03:54.120> or

close to my house because the ice or
basically<00:03:55.159> so<00:03:56.159> i'm<00:03:56.370> going<00:03:56.549> to<00:03:56.639> believe<00:03:56.879> it

00:03:59.379 --> 00:03:59.389 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:15.870 

here<00:04:00.389> we<00:04:00.689> have<00:04:00.870> with<00:04:01.079> the<00:04:01.290> sound

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.940 

let's<00:04:16.840> know<00:04:17.140> this

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
let's know this

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:28.170 
let's know this
okay<00:04:19.950> so<00:04:20.010> see<00:04:20.340> if<00:04:20.489> this<00:04:20.790> is<00:04:21.090> good

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:35.330 

was<00:04:29.180> it<00:04:29.330> better

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:41.820 

you

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.510 

and<00:04:42.340> I<00:04:42.430> tried<00:04:42.670> to<00:04:42.700> figure<00:04:43.030> out<00:04:43.360> if<00:04:43.660> you<00:04:43.750> can

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
and I tried to figure out if you can

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:56.310 
and I tried to figure out if you can
sound<00:04:45.520> well<00:04:46.090> it<00:04:46.210> is<00:04:46.360> babies<00:04:47.760> repeat<00:04:48.760> before

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.310 

you

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.540 

audio<00:05:01.070> gain<00:05:01.310> let's<00:05:01.820> see<00:05:02.060> if<00:05:02.150> we<00:05:02.240> can<00:05:02.390> load

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
audio gain let's see if we can load

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.400 
audio gain let's see if we can load
minus<00:05:04.550> 6<00:05:04.760> decibels

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.920 

okay<00:05:08.410> so<00:05:08.470> let's<00:05:08.740> see<00:05:08.889> if<00:05:09.100> this<00:05:09.430> works

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:18.350 

you

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.540

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:30.849 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:50.900

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:50.910 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.250 

you

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:53.260 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.000

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:33.070 
now you can see here the enemy starts to
spawn<00:06:20.460> and<00:06:20.730> hope<00:06:21.150> we<00:06:22.050> see<00:06:22.910> that's<00:06:24.740> problematic
