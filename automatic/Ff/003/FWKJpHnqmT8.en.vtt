00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.058
 War. War never changes. 

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:08.671
 The end of the world came almost exactly as predicted. 

00:00:08.672 --> 00:00:12.906
 Too large population, too little space and natural resources. 

00:00:12.907 --> 00:00:15.610
 Details are not important. 

00:00:15.611 --> 00:00:19.834
 Reasons - as usual, typically human. 

00:00:21.404 --> 00:00:23.254
 Almost all life on Earth has been annihilated. 

00:00:23.255 --> 00:00:30.336
 The destructive power of the atomic spark of human hands quickly wandered out of control. 

00:00:30.337 --> 00:00:34.234
 Columns of radioactive fire rolled through the world. 

00:00:34.235 --> 00:00:38.942
 The continents were enveloped by flames and swallowed by boiling oceans. 

00:00:38.943 --> 00:00:47.073
 People were almost completely extinct, and their ghosts melted with the radiation wave that covered the whole Earth. 

00:00:47.074 --> 00:00:52.234
 Silence and darkness took over the planet, ruling over all of them for many years. 

00:00:52.235 --> 00:00:55.551
 Only a few survived. 

00:00:55.552 --> 00:01:00.725
 Some have found a safe haven in the huge underground crypts. 

00:01:00.726 --> 00:01:04.900
 When the great darkness passed away, the Krypt's door was opened, 

00:01:04.901 --> 00:01:08.813
 and their inhabitants returned to the surface to start a new life. 

00:01:08.814 --> 00:01:13.170
 One of the northern tribes maintains that he descends from a resident of the Vault. 

00:01:13.171 --> 00:01:17.482
 Fortress, that their ancestor, known as the "Crew of the Vault", 

00:01:17.483 --> 00:01:20.277
 He once saved the world from the great evil. 

00:01:20.278 --> 00:01:24.751
 According to their legend, the evil raised his head far to the south, 

00:01:24.752 --> 00:01:30.472
 destroying everything touched, turning people into beasts. 

00:01:30.473 --> 00:01:35.373
 Only thanks to the mute of Przybysz from the Vault, the evil has been annihilated. 

00:01:35.374 --> 00:01:40.543
 But the great act involves great sacrifices. 

00:01:40.544 --> 00:01:44.441
 To save humanity he had to sacrifice himself and many of his friends. 

00:01:44.442 --> 00:01:49.752
 When he finally returned home, for the security he fought so fiercely, he was expelled. 

00:01:49.753 --> 00:01:51.956
 Outcast. 

00:01:51.957 --> 00:01:57.033
 Defending people against what they were so afraid of became in their eyes to others ... 

00:01:57.034 --> 00:01:59.223
 he was not their hero anymore. 

00:01:59.546 --> 00:02:03.380
 Abandoned by his people, he left for the Wastes. 

00:02:03.381 --> 00:02:07.930
 He went to the north until he came to the great canyons. 

00:02:07.931 --> 00:02:14.754
 There, he founded a small settlement, Arroyo, in which he spent the rest of his days. 

00:02:14.755 --> 00:02:20.027
 That's how, for many generations since the day it was founded, Arroyo was growing in the room, 

00:02:20.028 --> 00:02:23.634
 separated from the outside world by cavernous canyons. 

00:02:24.352 --> 00:02:25.525
 It's a house. 

00:02:25.526 --> 00:02:27.747
 Your home. 

00:02:27.748 --> 00:02:31.414
 But the scars left by the war have not healed yet. 

00:02:31.415 --> 00:02:35.167
 And the Earth still did not forget ...
