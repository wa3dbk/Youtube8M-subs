00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:08.500 
hi thought I'd do this video show you my

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.480 
hi thought I'd do this video show you my
new<00:00:08.650> haircut<00:00:08.890> I<00:00:09.370> cut<00:00:09.610> my<00:00:09.760> hair<00:00:09.940> two<00:00:10.180> days<00:00:10.389> ago

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
new haircut I cut my hair two days ago

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.390 
new haircut I cut my hair two days ago
into<00:00:12.490> what<00:00:12.730> I'm<00:00:13.020> hoping<00:00:14.020> is<00:00:14.559> more<00:00:14.889> or<00:00:15.010> less<00:00:15.070> a

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:15.400 
into what I'm hoping is more or less a

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.090 
into what I'm hoping is more or less a
MIDI<00:00:15.700> plus<00:00:16.000> haircut<00:00:16.480> I<00:00:16.690> think<00:00:17.080> the<00:00:17.350> length<00:00:17.800> is

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:18.100 
MIDI plus haircut I think the length is

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.070 
MIDI plus haircut I think the length is
a<00:00:18.130> little<00:00:18.400> bit<00:00:18.520> longer<00:00:18.670> so<00:00:19.000> it's<00:00:19.090> more<00:00:19.270> in

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.080 
a little bit longer so it's more in

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.390 
a little bit longer so it's more in
between<00:00:20.410> the<00:00:20.500> MIDI<00:00:20.650> plus<00:00:20.890> and<00:00:21.130> a<00:00:21.160> femme<00:00:21.370> fatale

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:21.400 
between the MIDI plus and a femme fatale

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.520
