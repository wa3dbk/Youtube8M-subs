tactics<00:00:34.329> look<00:00:34.960> at<00:00:35.050> this<00:00:35.140> right<00:00:35.379> here<00:00:35.410> you've

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739 
tactics look at this right here you've

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:37.200 
tactics look at this right here you've
got<00:00:35.770> a<00:00:35.920> starship<00:00:36.430> floating<00:00:36.850> around<00:00:36.940> in<00:00:37.120> space

got a starship floating around in space
and<00:00:37.600> it<00:00:38.320> detects<00:00:38.650> a<00:00:38.800> small<00:00:39.040> vessel<00:00:39.460> so<00:00:40.120> the

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
and it detects a small vessel so the

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.689 
and it detects a small vessel so the
shields<00:00:40.660> go<00:00:40.839> up<00:00:40.989> well<00:00:41.710> as<00:00:41.920> we<00:00:42.160> have<00:00:42.309> seen<00:00:42.519> in

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
simply toss something at the shield and

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.410 
simply toss something at the shield and
have<00:00:47.379> the<00:00:47.500> shield's<00:00:47.829> disappear<00:00:48.339> and<00:00:48.519> then<00:00:49.120> out

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420

they're offended by this are going to

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:21.990 
they're offended by this are going to
have<00:01:20.530> to<00:01:20.679> consider<00:01:20.979> the<00:01:21.160> fact<00:01:21.369> that<00:01:21.520> Star<00:01:21.970> Trek

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
have to consider the fact that Star Trek

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.309 
have to consider the fact that Star Trek
is<00:01:22.630> an<00:01:23.250> extension<00:01:24.250> of<00:01:24.429> human<00:01:24.850> history<00:01:25.569> whereas

that ever would have formed on this

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:32.880 
that ever would have formed on this
planet<00:01:31.149> so<00:01:31.270> if<00:01:31.509> human<00:01:31.869> beings<00:01:31.899> lived<00:01:32.619> which

they did in this very far faraway galaxy

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.010 
they did in this very far faraway galaxy
maybe<00:01:36.459> humans<00:01:36.849> eventually<00:01:37.119> came<00:01:37.660> here<00:01:37.899> on

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020
