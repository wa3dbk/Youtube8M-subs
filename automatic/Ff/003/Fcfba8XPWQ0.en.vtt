join a game a set of 66 when you're
playing<00:01:55.229> solo<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.399> just<00:01:56.640> hop<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:57.030> and

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
playing solo and you just hop it and

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.429 
playing solo and you just hop it and
you're<00:01:57.270> put<00:01:57.479> in<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.630> game's<00:01:57.840> halfway<00:01:58.200> through

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
you're put in the game's halfway through

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.690 
you're put in the game's halfway through
and<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.590> just<00:01:58.740> don't<00:01:59.009> want<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.280> play<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.579> so

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
and you just don't want to play it so

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.370 
and you just don't want to play it so
you<00:01:59.790> just<00:01:59.939> leave<00:02:00.180> straightaway<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:01.020> you

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
you just leave straightaway and you

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.289 
you just leave straightaway and you
stack<00:02:01.829> losses<00:02:02.310> up<00:02:02.430> so<00:02:02.790> quickly<00:02:03.090> especially

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
stack losses up so quickly especially

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.090 
stack losses up so quickly especially
over<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.780> long<00:02:03.990> period<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.350> time<00:02:04.439> it's<00:02:04.710> really

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
over a long period of time it's really

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.830 
over a long period of time it's really
hard<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.399> keep<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.610> win-loss<00:02:05.850> ratio<00:02:06.329> I<00:02:06.570> think

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
hard to keep a win-loss ratio I think

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.749 
hard to keep a win-loss ratio I think
you<00:02:06.930> need<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.110> find<00:02:07.409> out<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.619> way<00:02:07.799> where<00:02:08.670> the

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
you need to find out a way where the

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.460 
you need to find out a way where the
hoes<00:02:08.970> dashboards<00:02:09.629> and<00:02:09.660> you<00:02:09.780> get<00:02:09.959> booted<00:02:10.319> from

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
hoes dashboards and you get booted from

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.020 
hoes dashboards and you get booted from
the<00:02:10.560> game<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:11.009> not<00:02:11.310> affect<00:02:11.640> your<00:02:11.760> win-loss

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
the game to not affect your win-loss

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.090 
the game to not affect your win-loss
ratio<00:02:12.420> because<00:02:12.690> it's

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
ratio because it's

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.610 
ratio because it's
fair<00:02:13.430> like<00:02:14.150> you<00:02:14.660> would<00:02:14.840> winning<00:02:15.080> a<00:02:15.290> winning<00:02:15.530> by

am a leaf mainly been using lethal zand

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.070 
am a leaf mainly been using lethal zand
like<00:02:25.460> when<00:02:25.700> you're<00:02:25.850> using<00:02:26.060> non-lethal<00:02:26.600> it's<00:02:26.990> a

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
like when you're using non-lethal it's a

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.960 
like when you're using non-lethal it's a
lot<00:02:27.350> easier<00:02:27.560> to<00:02:28.040> get<00:02:28.160> a<00:02:28.220> high<00:02:28.430> score<00:02:28.730> /<00:02:28.940> a

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
lot easier to get a high score / a

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.320 
lot easier to get a high score / a
minute<00:02:29.240> then<00:02:30.110> when<00:02:30.800> you're<00:02:30.890> using<00:02:31.330> lethal

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
minute then when you're using lethal

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.510 
minute then when you're using lethal
because<00:02:32.720> joining<00:02:33.170> it<00:02:33.260> 15<00:02:33.560> score<00:02:33.830> per<00:02:34.070> kill

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
because joining it 15 score per kill

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.970 
because joining it 15 score per kill
with<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:34.850> labels<00:02:35.210> while<00:02:35.420> you<00:02:35.720> like<00:02:36.170> 30<00:02:36.590> score
