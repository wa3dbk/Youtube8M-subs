emitting from the whole globe of as a

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.450 
emitting from the whole globe of as a
lightsaber<00:04:27.880> itself<00:04:28.860> which<00:04:29.860> it<00:04:30.040> should<00:04:30.280> be

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
lightsaber itself which it should be

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.310 
lightsaber itself which it should be

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
it's got rod in the center of the

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.870 
it's got rod in the center of the
lightsaber<00:04:35.500> is<00:04:35.740> brighter<00:04:36.130> then<00:04:36.400> it<00:04:36.580> has<00:04:36.670> that

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
lightsaber is brighter then it has that

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.570 
lightsaber is brighter then it has that
glowing<00:04:37.180> effect<00:04:37.630> emitting<00:04:38.470> from<00:04:38.620> the<00:04:38.830> light

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
glowing effect emitting from the light

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.670 
glowing effect emitting from the light
source<00:04:39.610> itself<00:04:40.330> and<00:04:40.690> that's<00:04:41.260> what<00:04:41.470> it<00:04:41.560> really

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
source itself and that's what it really

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.280 
source itself and that's what it really
looks<00:04:41.800> like<00:04:42.070> if<00:04:42.400> you<00:04:42.790> were<00:04:42.910> here<00:04:43.300> so
