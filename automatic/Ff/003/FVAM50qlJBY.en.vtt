motorcycle eye qualities in any way is a
good<00:02:39.520> thing<00:02:39.730> in<00:02:40.150> fact<00:02:40.420> in<00:02:40.540> my<00:02:40.720> books<00:02:41.020> it's

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
good thing in fact in my books it's

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.950 
good thing in fact in my books it's
downright<00:02:41.680> awesome<00:02:42.280> so<00:02:43.240> you<00:02:43.300> do<00:02:43.540> have<00:02:43.660> a<00:02:43.720> roof

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
downright awesome so you do have a roof

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.690 
downright awesome so you do have a roof
over<00:02:44.080> your<00:02:44.230> head<00:02:44.500> but<00:02:45.160> there<00:02:45.430> are<00:02:45.490> no<00:02:45.550> windows

can<00:02:49.450> feel<00:02:49.720> everything<00:02:50.080> it's<00:02:50.950> not<00:02:51.130> quite<00:02:51.370> wind

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
can feel everything it's not quite wind

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.300 
can feel everything it's not quite wind
in<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:51.820> hair<00:02:51.850> what<00:02:52.720> it<00:02:52.840> is<00:02:53.020> wind<00:02:53.440> the<00:02:53.590> face<00:02:53.770> is

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
in the hair what it is wind the face is

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:00.750 
in the hair what it is wind the face is
below<00:02:58.200> so<00:02:59.200> you<00:02:59.530> can<00:02:59.710> smell<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.130> fresh<00:03:00.460> cut

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
you drive along but unlike a proper car

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.020 
you drive along but unlike a proper car
it<00:03:08.470> doesn't<00:03:08.860> have<00:03:08.980> any<00:03:09.100> air<00:03:09.280> conditioning<00:03:09.459> or

it doesn't have any air conditioning or
proper<00:03:10.450> windows<00:03:10.840> so<00:03:11.440> if<00:03:11.590> it's<00:03:11.740> raining<00:03:12.160> or<00:03:12.310> hot

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
proper windows so if it's raining or hot

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.540 
proper windows so if it's raining or hot
well<00:03:13.180> you're<00:03:13.600> gonna<00:03:13.750> feel<00:03:14.080> but<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.160> Twizy
