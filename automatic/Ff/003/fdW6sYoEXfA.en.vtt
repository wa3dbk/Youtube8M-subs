extra spare tire I went with the

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.299 
extra spare tire I went with the
modifications<00:00:43.719> I<00:00:43.840> did<00:00:44.020> to<00:00:44.170> the<00:00:44.290> trailer<00:00:44.680> the

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:45.309 
modifications I did to the trailer the

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:46.590 
modifications I did to the trailer the
trailer<00:00:45.340> is<00:00:45.670> an<00:00:45.760> excellent<00:00:46.000> trailer<00:00:46.420> but<00:00:46.570> it

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
trailer is an excellent trailer but it

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.360 
trailer is an excellent trailer but it
does<00:00:47.110> have<00:00:47.289> some<00:00:47.500> shortcomings<00:00:47.860> which<00:00:48.219> I'll

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
does have some shortcomings which I'll

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.760 
does have some shortcomings which I'll
explain<00:00:48.789> I<00:00:50.370> added<00:00:51.370> some<00:00:52.050> buddy<00:00:53.050> bearings<00:00:53.530> to

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
explain I added some buddy bearings to

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.729 
explain I added some buddy bearings to
it<00:00:53.890> so<00:00:54.430> you<00:00:54.610> can<00:00:54.640> grease<00:00:55.030> the<00:00:55.320> hub's<00:00:56.320> up<00:00:56.559> all

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
it so you can grease the hub's up all

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:57.270 
it so you can grease the hub's up all
the<00:00:56.860> time

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
the time

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.229 
the time
and<00:00:59.129> here's<00:01:00.129> a<00:01:00.219> couple<00:01:00.489> of<00:01:00.670> shortcomings

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
and here's a couple of shortcomings

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.170 
and here's a couple of shortcomings
these<00:01:01.960> bars<00:01:02.739> that<00:01:02.949> they<00:01:03.250> have<00:01:03.489> here<00:01:03.820> if<00:01:04.030> you

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
these bars that they have here if you

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.109 
these bars that they have here if you
look<00:01:04.360> at<00:01:04.680> carefully<00:01:05.760> you'll<00:01:06.760> see<00:01:06.790> that

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:07.119 
look at carefully you'll see that

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:08.910 
look at carefully you'll see that
they're<00:01:07.270> actually<00:01:07.450> bending<00:01:08.110> they<00:01:08.500> don't<00:01:08.710> do

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
they're actually bending they don't do

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.590 
they're actually bending they don't do
very<00:01:09.189> well<00:01:09.310> when<00:01:09.700> you<00:01:09.790> put<00:01:09.909> a<00:01:09.970> kayak<00:01:10.360> in<00:01:10.510> the

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
very well when you put a kayak in the

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.850 
very well when you put a kayak in the
center<00:01:10.990> I'm<00:01:11.560> using<00:01:11.890> a<00:01:12.100> Hobie<00:01:12.460> Cat

The Adventure Island and it weighs when
I<00:01:18.189> haven't<00:01:18.580> fully<00:01:18.729> loaded<00:01:19.090> it's<00:01:19.390> almost<00:01:19.630> like

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
I haven't fully loaded it's almost like

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.960 
I haven't fully loaded it's almost like
a<00:01:19.840> hundred<00:01:20.229> and<00:01:20.350> fifty<00:01:20.650> pounds<00:01:20.860> and<00:01:21.280> as<00:01:21.880> you

a hundred and fifty pounds and as you

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.270 
a hundred and fifty pounds and as you
can<00:01:22.119> see<00:01:22.270> it's<00:01:22.390> bending<00:01:22.780> the<00:01:22.900> bar<00:01:23.110> so<00:01:24.100> what<00:01:24.250> I

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
can see it's bending the bar so what I

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.600 
can see it's bending the bar so what I
did<00:01:24.520> on<00:01:24.670> the<00:01:24.759> front<00:01:25.200> bar<00:01:26.200> is<00:01:26.439> I<00:01:26.619> reinforced<00:01:27.340> it

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
did on the front bar is I reinforced it

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.270 
did on the front bar is I reinforced it
I<00:01:27.850> have<00:01:28.570> actually<00:01:29.200> a<00:01:29.229> rebar<00:01:29.619> in<00:01:29.830> the<00:01:29.920> center<00:01:30.250> of

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.830 

for<00:03:25.810> the<00:03:25.930> sake<00:03:26.140> of<00:03:26.170> the<00:03:26.380> video<00:03:26.530> these<00:03:27.220> are<00:03:27.400> the

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
for the sake of the video these are the

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.040 
for the sake of the video these are the
Hobie<00:03:29.070> deals<00:03:30.070> that<00:03:30.220> I<00:03:30.310> was<00:03:30.400> talking<00:03:30.760> about

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
Hobie deals that I was talking about

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.320 
Hobie deals that I was talking about
there<00:03:32.050> I<00:03:32.740> can't<00:03:33.340> remember<00:03:33.550> I'm<00:03:33.910> going<00:03:34.120> to<00:03:34.180> say

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
there I can't remember I'm going to say

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.750 
there I can't remember I'm going to say
two<00:03:34.390> to<00:03:34.720> three<00:03:34.930> hundred<00:03:34.960> dollars<00:03:35.760> definitely

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
two to three hundred dollars definitely

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.690 
two to three hundred dollars definitely
garbage<00:03:37.150> do<00:03:37.600> not<00:03:37.900> buy<00:03:38.170> these<00:03:38.280> so<00:03:39.280> this<00:03:39.370> is<00:03:39.520> what

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
garbage do not buy these so this is what

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.060 
garbage do not buy these so this is what
they<00:03:39.790> look<00:03:40.000> like<00:03:40.030> as<00:03:40.390> you<00:03:40.690> can<00:03:40.930> see<00:03:41.230> to<00:03:41.860> mount

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
they look like as you can see to mount

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.340 
they look like as you can see to mount
them<00:03:42.340> they<00:03:43.060> have<00:03:43.240> these<00:03:43.510> mounting<00:03:43.960> holes<00:03:43.990> so

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
them they have these mounting holes so

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.640 
them they have these mounting holes so
you<00:03:44.440> have<00:03:44.680> to<00:03:44.860> actually<00:03:45.450> physically<00:03:46.650> mount

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
you have to actually physically mount

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.290 
you have to actually physically mount
this<00:03:47.830> to<00:03:47.890> your<00:03:48.100> trailer<00:03:48.520> it's<00:03:48.670> a<00:03:48.760> permanent

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
this to your trailer it's a permanent

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.260 
this to your trailer it's a permanent
mount<00:03:49.680> so<00:03:50.680> that's<00:03:51.550> why<00:03:51.670> I<00:03:51.730> don't<00:03:51.820> like<00:03:52.030> this

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
mount so that's why I don't like this

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.080 
mount so that's why I don't like this
not<00:03:52.990> very<00:03:53.020> good<00:03:53.550> you're<00:03:54.550> better<00:03:54.730> off<00:03:54.820> with

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
not very good you're better off with

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.640 
not very good you're better off with
these<00:03:55.270> because<00:03:55.540> these<00:03:55.840> are<00:03:55.900> just<00:03:56.260> hold<00:03:56.470> on

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
these because these are just hold on

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.510 
these because these are just hold on
with<00:03:56.890> with<00:03:57.460> these<00:03:57.640> clamps<00:03:58.000> right<00:03:58.270> here

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
with with these clamps right here

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.430 
with with these clamps right here
and<00:04:00.060> you<00:04:00.150> can<00:04:00.330> remove<00:04:00.630> it<00:04:00.840> you<00:04:00.960> can<00:04:00.990> slide<00:04:01.410> it

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
and you can remove it you can slide it

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.710 
and you can remove it you can slide it
off<00:04:01.770> whatever<00:04:02.010> way<00:04:02.340> you<00:04:03.060> want<00:04:03.090> to<00:04:03.330> go<00:04:03.420> with<00:04:03.600> it

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
off whatever way you want to go with it

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.190 
off whatever way you want to go with it
that's<00:04:04.560> my<00:04:04.740> final<00:04:04.980> input<00:04:05.640> on<00:04:06.270> that<00:04:06.450> good<00:04:06.990> luck

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
that's my final input on that good luck

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.850 
that's my final input on that good luck
and<00:04:08.570> this<00:04:09.570> is<00:04:09.720> basically<00:04:10.170> what<00:04:10.440> it<00:04:10.500> looks<00:04:10.710> like

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
and this is basically what it looks like

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.370 
and this is basically what it looks like
right<00:04:11.190> here
