00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:19.050
 on a visit to June that is difficult 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.610
 To start this video, I've already started it. 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.660
 3 times 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:27.029
 the actress was broken cyrus ascended ti 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.210
 and even more my team would have for you guys 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.800
 but the team and I'm going to teach you something that 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.079
 people asked in the comments of the 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.120
 last one I liked because it was one of the 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.899
 photos it seemed that I was scratching 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.120
 eyes and I commented with which 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.920
 One day I will learn to remember in the 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.130
 hour as if you cut your eyes always 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.970
 forget it and I just so it's good that it itches 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.030
 huh 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.370
 So I saw this video was taught to 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.170
 You 're with the back of the hand, I 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.400
 I do not remember that at school this month 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.170
 the person who taught me said it here 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.760
 Because we get a lot of stuff like that. 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.310
 with the palm of your hand then you end up having 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.829
 more bacteria these things in her with the 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.479
 Backs of drugs have no bacterial 

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:12.119
 as much as in the palm so it 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:14.640
 so they scratch themselves , right? 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.860
 only with care because also 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.530
 It happens to me, I'm going to leave my 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.640
 hair and learns inside the eye is only with 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.159
 this margin 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.540
 So, how's it going with these hours? 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:31.770
 now let's get down to the matter is who actually 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:39.570
 it's an area and the one who created it was a gringo 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:44.640
 I do not know his name right, right? 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:49.049
 eh and cti and it's and ads I'll put the link 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.869

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.770
 Created Hebrew Good Parents in Black Color 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.869
 tie 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.380
 I loved this tag the first channel 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:03.299
 A British girl like that cares. 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:05.670
 very funny and beautiful had the image of 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.599
 Santa, it 's just I went to find out that I had 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.930
 Tag this product 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:16.489
 to produce but I'm not sure who the 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.489
 I see older than I found 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:23.100
 months ago who translated was the channel 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.740
 to a reader and translated it as a rainbow 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.500
 book but in other videos 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.960
 I do not know who was the first and I do not know 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:35.010
 what you did with that name is the first 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:37.850
 person to 'crisis' having literary then a 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:42.000
 was the first to display the 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.950
 I do not know what's in this tag. 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.130
 to select seven books on the shelf 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:50.010
 one with each of the colors this is a 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:53.850
 sin woke up from the rainbow right 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:57.000
 and there may be all of the konÃ© cover is 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:59.640
 side or just the hood the side I 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.500
 I chose the side if you go see 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.239
 so I was seeing that most of the 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.260
 books I chose the cover is not the color 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:11.180
 of the rainbow 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:13.350
 but then we will not suppose that 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:18.720
 present red color that I chose 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:22.890
 It was forsyth that was what I won in 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:27.570
 Saturday in his blog is not red only 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:31.860
 There's this side of us, but it's 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:42.870
 red and the side was also ignored 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:43.860
 his ect it's all red to color 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.750
 orange 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.769
 I wanted to choose only books I read 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:52.560
 But I think it 's an angel book and this one. 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:55.590
 book here that I selected vacations 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.450
 meanwhile it is part of a series 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.440
 I'm crazy to read but only have one 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:10.820
 second third book 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:10.820
 the former guarantees him 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:18.180
 the yellow one I chose to make your request 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.130
 The book that I'm reading the moment I 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.419
 I received from temec's publisher. 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.419
 he is pink 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:34.090
 7 I will not review today nor tomorrow anymore 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:37.830
 I want this all week long. 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:41.289
 dark green color that I have not read yet 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:47.500
 which is the value ray and white is fake but in the 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:59.800
 Truth this year, I'm pretty curious. 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:05:02.199
 blue tour to write a beautiful book 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.570
 wonderful one of my intentions of him 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:07.389
 I really want to 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.650
 Hindu version this is the fault of the stars 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:11.199
 I have to be in Portuguese too. 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.430
 That's what I did with the blog, but I 'm 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:23.610
 in love with sam shepard's friend 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:23.610
 English cabbage you and I then it is 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:44.370
 because it is black or indigo difficulty 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:53.500
 it's a dark blue blue 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:56.110
 so I just chose is head of 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.970
 wind that although it seems recent 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.610
 It seems black so I think he 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:03.659
 this color on the side I think he 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:08.530
 it's kind of blue and purple 

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:12.099
 I hope it's the violet color I chose 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:14.699
 to make a 4d paula pepper film that neither 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:24.699
 all purple all violet 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:33.699
 So Ze is the assets I chose my 

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:35.979
