00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:04.160
 I want to tell 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:11.590
 forgot hello everyone it's max come home 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:19.289
 as always work man trouble not 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:23.339
 have worked 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:27.419
 forfeits parse parse and here 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:31.019
 look look at this carpet 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:35.129
 will allow but it's okay 21 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.170
 the tourist will find it so clear than me 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.860
 I'll show you what we will do now. 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.860
 repair 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:51.710
 generally 12 condensers swelled it 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:55.739
 normally one problem is that it 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:59.909
 Of course those new Conder that I took 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:02.430
 not in height anymore and as luck would have it 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:06.540
 under the radiator and not lay 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:09.170
 have to drink something or wise learn 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.170
 up we will come up 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.689
 me in general one unexpected flooring 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:23.009
 the problem is hollow 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:26.360
 Conder evaporates at all does not want 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:33.060
 melts but does not want 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:36.440
 overall I had to raft up 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:40.290
 some kind of fashion 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.420
 I had to add it to melt here 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:47.750
 it's all 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:49.049
 idiotic and generally only in this way 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.140
 somehow 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.650
 pick out these Conder here do not know 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.970
 melting temperature 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.970
 much more than the usual catch 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:10.190
 she is not even about 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:10.190
 10 pieces still melted 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:27.870
 when canned food and eat any heat 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:39.750
 once a bit a girl is there again 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:43.350
 warm up 1 hole die though 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:46.500
 we put to nior chik and necessarily 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.740
 after soldering each capacitor each 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.110
 condenser 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.610
 check the tester for a short circuit 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.470
 because the tracks 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:03:02.220
 pass very close and even when 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:06.860
 Attentive soldering can be allowed 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:10.700
 error and if this error is made 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.700
 will have to say goodbye 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:21.930
 all ration ready in general all twelve 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:21.930
 capacitors are changed so they all lie 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:32.290
 In general, it remains a trifle 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:36.150
 wash off all the flux court of these all places there 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.150
 where did you eat everything 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:43.050
 here of course yet 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.050
 umma.ru subtlety, I now show immediately 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.570
 capacitors 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:52.750
 there were small four volts on 680 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:55.630
 I microfarads such we have not found a city 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.570
 I had to take 10 wills of the same 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:01.510
 capacity they are of course under the radiator 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.050
 stand straight and not intermeddle I had to 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.530
 put 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:10.810
 lying down we are behind a radiator radiator 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:12.630
 became infusions place rises it turns out that 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.510
 all capacitors 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:19.420
 Well, of course already lying on stand on 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.970
 least do not concern the radiator and cannot 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.970
 I'll tell you the truth 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:28.600
 evaporate old capacitors 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.290
 if it was not Wood's alloy anything 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.480
 Did not work out 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.880
 seriously nothing would have happened very 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.350
 a big melting point so 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:40.180
 which were soldered 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:43.500
 These Conder s in general, such is 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.980
 trouble well now rinse my wash and 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.700
 try to turn on 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:50.820
 there are two options or the key would not 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.820
 turn on 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:05:04.400
 still here of course one problem was created 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:10.260
 the form of tanks that were under the radiator 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:16.740
 they voltage 4 and 4 4 exactly four 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:21.240
 volts with a capacity of 800 680 microfarads at 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:26.010
 short circuit test all 6 m 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:29.340
 bones or seven times two three 4 5 six 7 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:31.650
 pieces they show a short circuit 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.660
 even at that moment when and completely 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:39.630
 drank it all shows a short circuit 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:43.070
 it turns out what nonsense in general 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:47.370
 the truth is either lucky or unlucky 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:49.380
 but I think you 're lucky and it will be visible in 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:53.550
 Generally when you go see them 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:55.169
 carefully carefully review better 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.729
 several times so that there is nowhere 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:06:00.350
 short circuit so that everything was 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:04.580
 beautiful it think that everything will be beautiful 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.580
 generally try to collect 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.490
 that it all worked 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:15.599
 works fine got infected fine 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.699
 no problems 

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:21.189
 in truth there is one change 

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:23.770
 although the RAM started 

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:28.919
 get infected for some reason less than 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:28.919
 it was loaded earlier well kondera was a lot 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:38.600
 I donâ€™t know the bad ones 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:40.720
 can not be well, too, so this is a hundred 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.720
 percent 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.480
 Well, everyone is happy
