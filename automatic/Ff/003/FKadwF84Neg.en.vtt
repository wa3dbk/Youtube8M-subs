00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:10.080
 help towards in for you welcome in 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.940
 this brand new video we are ready for 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.610
 talk about a nail shooter 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.490
 indeed not a mr that would be a 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.640
 battle rifle of the word 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:25.230
 Italian here are born id maxman rifles 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.970
 ie the rifles from the mark hamill mark mn 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.109
 it would be the shooter chosen so I am 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.910
 Shooter gun chosen is not a 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.489
 gun like the others I tell you right away 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.219
 and it must be used in a different way has a utility 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.800
 different and sometimes it makes you swear in 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.629
 differently I promise you that is if you 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.340
 play with these guns on 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.399
 kind of rose you make is kind 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.309
 compulsive ie when you start a 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.680
 shoot the enemy and by chance do one 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.199
 trade ie you killed yourself together or by chance 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.270
 you run and shooting from 800 meters that 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.280
 maybe drop big shots trying to 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.320
 hit on the shiny head 800 meters with a 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.329
 en tar you don't know how the fuck I do to 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.400
 shoot from that distance well you 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.960
 convulsions like you come 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.210
 whole arm tightens with 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.909
 protected in any case they do not serve only to 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.619
 rosiare di mr indeed are also second 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.750
 me of the good weapons used in some 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.479
 breakers or use them in a deathmatch in 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.729
 silico parenthesis guys I'd like it 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.520
 do a bit like bf3 ie when I talk to you 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.930
 arms to tell you about it and maybe in all of them 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.840
 the modalities and not let you see only 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.340
 domain and death match but since in 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.360
 my canon practically stopped 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.220
 play it all regularly and 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.860
 above all books or people 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.829
 which they are usually there to record it 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.649
 we play a little maybe once every 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.170
 two nights taken seriously and not there 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.180
 we play all bf3 every day 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.430
 the hours so it's a bit different 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.439
 record videos on weapons I have to 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.329
 force to do in t dm1 domain because it is the 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.850
 easiest way to do some kill 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.510
 take the hand with the weapon and talk about it 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.950
 in the correct and most important way 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.810
 in the correct way that maybe make you 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.600
 see a winning game rush with 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.250
 that weapon but not knowing how to see well 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.140
 as it is because it took me 30 years before 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.310
 to find a person and shoot them 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.920
 in short, this was a small parenthesis 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.600
 however today we talk about sks 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.740
 finally starts this shit of 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:20.980
 video escapes that s that 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:25.270
 basically a battle rifle 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.910
 Russian who at 333 in rate of fire wants to 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.010
 say he can shoot up to 330 three 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.230
 strokes per minute 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.540
 based on your spamming skills 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.580
 of the mouse but still the maximum e 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.060
 yes, this is how it works 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:43.360
 that is, it is the game that limits you to 3 333 of 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.670
 network of fire while in the cases of the 16 a 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.560
 4 of my 46 weapons eye blasts 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.010
 when they will be held or it means that i 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.200
 three bullets of the burst leave with 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.209
 a radius of 800 rounds per minute does not 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.400
 it means that the wine tera weapon if you go 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.620
 beyond that the rate of fire of the three 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.440
 bullets ok not the entire load 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.739
 anyway, sks is a shotgun 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:09.670
 single semi-automatic with 43 damage 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:11.470
 with 34 of minimum damage with 21 hits in the 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.989
 charger that recharges in two seconds e 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.300
 3 that an average time between mr la 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:19.600
 strength of this weapon is 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:22.360
 certainly the rate of fire because the 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.120
 faster to shoot among all of mr 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.430
 there is that the 88 but eleven is approaching 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.800
 shots in the charger so I would discard it 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:34.239
 regardless now how to use this weapon 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.700
 without telling you how you stand see in the 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.290
 game that is a weapon that in a certain 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.780
 if totti can also kill the 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.489
 people up close if you are very fast and 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.920
 especially if you don't take the first shot there 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:46.600
 because when you find an enemy in front of you 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.670
 with a di mr the most important thing 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.860
 pull the first shot in the chest or the 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.019
 ie head or where you are safe 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:57.160
 to remove them already 43 or at a point where 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:59.860
 you remove 43 for two that makes well 86 and 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.510
 so go get them a lot of 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.070
 life if for example you manage to give in 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.900
 head the first time a second will be enough 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.480
 bullet to kill him 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.629
 compared to f3 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.060
 Bovell weapons weapons as read ks as le 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:13.830
 my boss 11 killed in two shots 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.139
 almost everywhere 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.329
 here it is different here as you see they are there 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:20.609
 3 the third shot would be to take away 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:23.220
 those six remaining life provided that 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.840
 you didn't hit the head with the 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.690
 previous two shots go right there 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.090
 3 and it's not so easy to always shoot them 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:34.950
 so how to use this weapon up close 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:36.860
 I would say with something like one 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:40.650
 one is angled something that you 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:43.710
 soften the recoil a little put the 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.210
 laser sight and let you put 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.180
 the silencer but has not changed by 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.520
 much about this weapon in this case or 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.210
 you can leave it smooth and with the viewfinder 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.160
 laser 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.360
 you have a really good and with learning 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.820
 the same ones that can feed 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:00.420
 projected you will have a weapon with three clicks 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.740
 kills almost everyone the attention 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:03.180
 your gameplay at the level of movement 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.250
 it cannot be the same as with a 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.840
 assault rifle and if you pull the first one 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.020
 blow and the second you mix 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.760
 hide and pull the second two 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.800
 changing position or bypassing a 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.290
 little the enemy in short, play it a 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.850
 dancing with him hoping that 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.490
 dance finish it before he lies down for 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.240
 earth with a lake of blood under his 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.920
 body 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.480
 now if you want to use it from the moment 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.670
 it is absolutely not excluded that it is one 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.650
 good idea and with the same kind of 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:31.290
 grip or angled to be able to 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:34.440
 quietly use a heavy rod 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:35.790
 now if you disparate by moving and running 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.580
 I suggest you put a handle 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:43.020
 as wide because in fact it limits you to a 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:46.860
 little spread on the soldier's movement 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:49.590
 it is not the concept of spread that is up 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.540
 PCs and assaults where repeating gusts 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:54.120
 you have the blows that make a rose not here 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:56.250
 it's more like losing one's precision 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.900
 while you move then a handicap that 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.030
 with broad is a little reduced if 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.980
 you can shoot from kneeling with 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:03.210
 a nice angled you will see that you will do the 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:06.300
 difference the shots will go more or less 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:08.580
 in short, everyone in the viewfinder is among the 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.320
 by mr in my opinion one of the best book 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.760
 verone'll try others I recommend in 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.280
 description there is the list of weapons that 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.990
 I haven't done yet 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.090
 leave in the comments a vote of one of which 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.480
 they are then spread with the weapon that 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.880
 want 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.350
 in the next video we'll see you at 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:26.960
 next 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:26.960
 comment and vote if you want losers there
