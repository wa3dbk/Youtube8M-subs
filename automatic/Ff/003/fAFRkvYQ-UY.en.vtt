reservoir which everyone understands
that<00:01:06.670> provides<00:01:07.660> for<00:01:07.930> a<00:01:07.960> tremendous

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:08.649 
that provides for a tremendous

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:11.310 
that provides for a tremendous
additional<00:01:09.580> travel<00:01:10.060> allowance<00:01:10.660> so<00:01:10.869> the<00:01:11.080> right

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
additional travel allowance so the right

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.859 
additional travel allowance so the right
enhancement<00:01:12.130> is<00:01:12.250> phenomenal<00:01:12.849> and<00:01:13.000> you'll<00:01:13.690> see

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
enhancement is phenomenal and you'll see

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:14.999 
enhancement is phenomenal and you'll see
this<00:01:13.959> little<00:01:14.140> map<00:01:14.380> here<00:01:14.649> this<00:01:14.830> is<00:01:14.979> a

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
this little map here this is a

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:16.800 
this little map here this is a
compression<00:01:15.429> dampening<00:01:15.970> adjustment<00:01:16.630> feature

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
compression dampening adjustment feature

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.320 
compression dampening adjustment feature
so<00:01:17.380> now<00:01:17.530> not<00:01:17.709> only<00:01:17.740> is<00:01:18.039> their<00:01:18.459> twin<00:01:18.819> deflected

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
so now not only is their twin deflected

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.999 
so now not only is their twin deflected
disc<00:01:19.509> technology<00:01:20.110> going<00:01:20.289> on<00:01:20.500> in<00:01:20.679> the<00:01:20.800> main

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
disc technology going on in the main

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:23.669 
disc technology going on in the main
damper<00:01:21.580> but<00:01:22.360> this<00:01:22.539> too<00:01:22.810> if<00:01:23.020> we<00:01:23.170> had<00:01:23.319> a<00:01:23.349> cutaway

00:01:23.669 --> 00:01:23.679 
damper but this too if we had a cutaway

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:26.219 
damper but this too if we had a cutaway
here<00:01:23.950> it<00:01:24.520> acts<00:01:24.759> on<00:01:25.000> another<00:01:25.539> piston<00:01:26.110> that's

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
here it acts on another piston that's

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.529 
here it acts on another piston that's
twin<00:01:26.590> deflective<00:01:27.160> disc<00:01:27.369> to<00:01:27.880> give<00:01:28.090> that<00:01:28.300> writer

the next step up is twin tube where it
moves<00:02:03.520> oil<00:02:03.819> from<00:02:04.090> an<00:02:04.179> inner<00:02:04.330> tube<00:02:04.539> to<00:02:04.810> an<00:02:04.929> outer

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
order to move the oil now you have to

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.940 
order to move the oil now you have to
have<00:02:20.270> disks<00:02:20.720> on<00:02:20.900> both<00:02:21.080> sides<00:02:21.380> of<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.770> piston

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
have disks on both sides of the piston

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.910 
have disks on both sides of the piston
with<00:02:22.700> orifices<00:02:23.210> through<00:02:23.600> it<00:02:23.690> so<00:02:24.140> they<00:02:24.320> flex<00:02:24.680> as

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
with orifices through it so they flex as

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.010 
with orifices through it so they flex as
the<00:02:25.250> shock<00:02:25.460> compresses<00:02:26.150> and<00:02:26.330> then<00:02:26.510> rebounds

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
the shock compresses and then rebounds

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.530 
the shock compresses and then rebounds

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
of the piston to the other okay so

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.340 
of the piston to the other okay so
bottom<00:02:31.460> line<00:02:31.790> is<00:02:32.060> instead<00:02:33.050> of<00:02:33.110> like<00:02:33.320> a

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
bottom line is instead of like a

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.200 
bottom line is instead of like a
traditional<00:02:33.980> shock<00:02:34.220> it<00:02:34.430> has<00:02:34.580> oil<00:02:34.760> in<00:02:34.970> it<00:02:35.120> and

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
traditional shock it has oil in it and

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.610 
traditional shock it has oil in it and
it<00:02:35.300> moves<00:02:35.510> up<00:02:35.690> and<00:02:35.810> down<00:02:35.870> and<00:02:36.110> as<00:02:36.170> it<00:02:36.200> moves<00:02:36.500> up

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
it moves up and down and as it moves up

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.350 
it moves up and down and as it moves up
the<00:02:36.740> viscosity<00:02:37.100> builds<00:02:37.580> up<00:02:37.700> it<00:02:37.850> starts<00:02:38.120> to<00:02:38.240> get

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
the viscosity builds up it starts to get

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.110 
the viscosity builds up it starts to get
aeration<00:02:39.050> so<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.800> value<00:02:40.250> of<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:40.520> oil<00:02:40.670> fades

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
aeration so the value of the oil fades

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.960 
aeration so the value of the oil fades
it's<00:02:41.600> not<00:02:41.780> as<00:02:41.990> smooth<00:02:42.560> or<00:02:42.830> it<00:02:43.370> doesn't<00:02:43.760> provide

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
it's not as smooth or it doesn't provide

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.580 
it's not as smooth or it doesn't provide
