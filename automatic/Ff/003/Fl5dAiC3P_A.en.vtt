00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
myself and then if that goes well I'll

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.929 
myself and then if that goes well I'll
maybe<00:02:02.500> think<00:02:02.799> about<00:02:02.860> adding<00:02:03.280> that<00:02:03.369> melody<00:02:03.819> on

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
maybe think about adding that melody on

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.899 
maybe think about adding that melody on
top<00:02:03.970> so<00:02:04.390> here<00:02:04.539> we<00:02:04.600> go<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.860> chord<00:02:06.159> and<00:02:06.429> the

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
top so here we go the chord and the

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:31.610 
top so here we go the chord and the
drums<00:02:07.179> at<00:02:07.360> the<00:02:07.450> same<00:02:07.600> time

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.410 

you<00:02:32.620> may<00:02:32.709> get<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.040> idea<00:02:33.099> that<00:02:36.360> this<00:02:37.360> thing

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
you may get the idea that this thing

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.270 
you may get the idea that this thing
that<00:02:37.750> melody<00:02:38.170> only<00:02:38.319> has<00:02:38.590> one<00:02:38.860> note<00:02:39.099> in<00:02:39.250> it

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280

that melody only has one note in it
that's<00:02:39.519> a<00:02:39.640> lighter<00:02:40.590> and<00:02:41.590> I<00:02:41.709> can<00:02:41.860> keep<00:02:42.010> this

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
that's a lighter and I can keep this

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.250 
that's a lighter and I can keep this
going<00:02:42.280> at<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:42.879> same<00:02:43.090> time<00:02:43.420> and<00:02:43.930> add<00:02:44.079> the

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
going at the same time and add the

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.470
