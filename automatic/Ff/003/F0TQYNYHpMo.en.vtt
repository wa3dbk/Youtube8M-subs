tender steam locomotive and it's a very
cheap<00:00:18.090> steam<00:00:18.359> locomotive<00:00:18.990> if<00:00:19.230> you<00:00:19.350> want<00:00:19.560> one

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770

cheap steam locomotive if you want one
this<00:00:20.760> cost<00:00:21.119> me<00:00:21.300> about<00:00:21.359> forty<00:00:21.930> five<00:00:22.080> dollars<00:00:22.619> at

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.139 
about sixty dollars so um guess let's
jump<00:00:31.710> into<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.040> review<00:00:32.660> as<00:00:33.680> this<00:00:34.680> is<00:00:34.890> an<00:00:35.280> iPad

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
jump into the review as this is an iPad

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.010 
jump into the review as this is an iPad
I<00:00:36.440> can't<00:00:37.440> zoom<00:00:38.300> so<00:00:39.300> I'm<00:00:39.510> just<00:00:39.629> gonna<00:00:39.750> be

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
I can't zoom so I'm just gonna be

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.580 
I can't zoom so I'm just gonna be
pointing<00:00:40.410> kind<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.739> things<00:00:40.890> out<00:00:41.129> with<00:00:41.430> C<00:00:42.590> okay

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
pointing kind of things out with C okay

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.619 
pointing kind of things out with C okay
so<00:00:43.649> as<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.280> can<00:00:44.489> see<00:00:44.640> there's<00:00:44.969> no<00:00:45.149> road<00:00:45.390> name

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629

on it I I like it that way

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.650 
on it I I like it that way
cuz<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.860> gives<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.340> missed<00:00:50.550> some<00:00:51.090> mysterious

like to paint the Bell and add some
details<00:01:02.480> but<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.510> can't<00:01:03.870> use<00:01:04.019> this<00:01:04.140> on<00:01:04.320> my

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
details but I can't use this on my

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.780 
details but I can't use this on my
larger<00:01:04.769> layout<00:01:05.040> as<00:01:05.220> there's<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:07.790> connection

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
larger layout as there's a connection

thing<00:01:09.270> work<00:01:09.600> this<00:01:09.990> one<00:01:10.290> it's<00:01:11.070> not<00:01:11.159> long<00:01:11.460> enough

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
thing work this one it's not long enough

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.600 
thing work this one it's not long enough
to<00:01:11.790> get<00:01:11.909> power<00:01:12.090> when<00:01:12.360> it's<00:01:12.479> going<00:01:12.689> over<00:01:12.990> a

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
to get power when it's going over a

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.960 
to get power when it's going over a
junction<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:15.380> this<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.560> slope<00:01:16.860> tender<00:01:17.340> you

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
junction and this is slope tender you

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.929 
junction and this is slope tender you
have<00:01:21.470> decent<00:01:22.470> enough<00:01:22.680> coal<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.280> think<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:23.820> works

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
have decent enough coal I think it works

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.289 
have decent enough coal I think it works
pretty<00:01:24.150> fine<00:01:24.409> and<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:26.130> actually<00:01:26.460> got<00:01:26.790> this<00:01:27.030> with

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
pretty fine and I actually got this with

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.370 
pretty fine and I actually got this with
a<00:01:27.330> couple<00:01:27.689> with<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.080> custom<00:01:29.930> hook<00:01:30.930> on<00:01:31.110> there<00:01:31.259> I'm

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
a couple with a custom hook on there I'm

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.740 
a couple with a custom hook on there I'm
pretty<00:01:31.680> sure<00:01:31.829> it's<00:01:32.280> custom<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.450> looks<00:01:33.600> as

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
pretty sure it's custom and it looks as

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.440 
pretty sure it's custom and it looks as
if<00:01:33.780> this<00:01:34.380> goes<00:01:34.740> on<00:01:35.070> there's<00:01:35.700> these<00:01:35.880> little

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
if this goes on there's these little

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.080 
if this goes on there's these little
special<00:01:36.780> flanges<00:01:37.409> right<00:01:37.590> there<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.009> this<00:01:38.939> is

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
special flanges right there and this is

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.179 
special flanges right there and this is
solder<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:40.110> looks<00:01:40.290> as<00:01:40.470> if<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:40.740> helps<00:01:41.009> get

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
solder and it looks as if it helps get

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.410 
solder and it looks as if it helps get
extra<00:01:42.000> pickup<00:01:42.390> but<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.680> hasn't<00:01:44.180> like<00:01:45.180> it

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
extra pickup but it hasn't like it

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.660 
extra pickup but it hasn't like it
doesn't<00:01:45.570> really<00:01:45.750> do<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:47.250> doesn't<00:01:47.490> seem

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
doesn't really do that it doesn't seem

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.240 
doesn't really do that it doesn't seem
like<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:47.909> does<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.680> but<00:01:49.680> it<00:01:49.799> looks<00:01:49.979> like<00:01:50.100> it's

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
like it does that but it looks like it's

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.910 
like it does that but it looks like it's
supposed<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.640> do<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:51.000> maybe<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:52.079> was<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.200> test

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
supposed to do that maybe it was a test

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.420 
supposed to do that maybe it was a test
but<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.310> works<00:01:54.320> and<00:01:55.320> sorry<00:01:56.130> I'm<00:01:56.189> doing<00:01:56.280> this

unlike<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.650> knuckle<00:02:24.950> couplers<00:02:25.310> and<00:02:25.760> I<00:02:26.630> know

unlike the knuckle couplers and I know

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.110 
unlike the knuckle couplers and I know
this<00:02:27.440> doesn't<00:02:27.740> sound<00:02:27.950> very<00:02:28.040> good<00:02:28.220> let's<00:02:28.910> say<00:02:29.090> I

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
this doesn't sound very good let's say I

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.430 
this doesn't sound very good let's say I

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
had some British rolling stock I could

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.500 
had some British rolling stock I could
run<00:02:30.890> my<00:02:31.190> American<00:02:31.730> locomotives<00:02:32.270> with<00:02:32.420> the

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
run my American locomotives with the

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.450 
run my American locomotives with the
British<00:02:32.780> rolling<00:02:33.050> stock<00:02:33.260> but<00:02:34.160> that's<00:02:34.340> not

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
British rolling stock but that's not

British rolling stock but that's not
what<00:02:34.610> I<00:02:34.640> liked<00:02:34.880> I<00:02:34.970> don't<00:02:35.240> like<00:02:35.360> to<00:02:35.480> do<00:02:35.600> that<00:02:35.810> and

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
what I liked I don't like to do that and

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.560 
what I liked I don't like to do that and
I<00:02:36.350> have<00:02:36.500> two<00:02:37.250> diesel<00:02:37.730> locomotives<00:02:38.210> at<00:02:38.360> the

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
I have two diesel locomotives at the

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.050 
I have two diesel locomotives at the
knuckle<00:02:38.870> couplers<00:02:39.260> and<00:02:39.440> I<00:02:40.370> kind<00:02:40.700> of<00:02:40.790> have<00:02:40.910> this

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
knuckle couplers and I kind of have this

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.550 
knuckle couplers and I kind of have this
one<00:02:42.040> great<00:02:43.040> car<00:02:43.310> that<00:02:43.640> I<00:02:43.670> use<00:02:43.850> this<00:02:44.000> conversion

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
one great car that I use this conversion

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.310 
one great car that I use this conversion
half<00:02:45.560> of<00:02:45.709> it's<00:02:45.890> a<00:02:46.070> rapido<00:02:46.610> style<00:02:47.270> and<00:02:48.170> the

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
half of it's a rapido style and the

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.949 
half of it's a rapido style and the
other<00:02:48.440> half<00:02:48.620> knuckle<00:02:49.480> so<00:02:50.480> if<00:02:50.720> I<00:02:50.810> have<00:02:50.900> a

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
other half knuckle so if I have a

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.830 
other half knuckle so if I have a
knuckle<00:02:51.730> locomotive<00:02:52.730> I<00:02:52.970> have<00:02:53.360> is<00:02:53.630> that

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
knuckle locomotive I have is that

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.110 
knuckle locomotive I have is that
because<00:02:54.230> most<00:02:54.530> of<00:02:54.709> my<00:02:54.770> cars<00:02:55.520> are<00:02:55.700> rapido

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
because most of my cars are rapido

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:02.650 
because most of my cars are rapido
and<00:02:57.730> so<00:02:59.230> the<00:03:00.230> detail<00:03:00.680> on<00:03:00.709> this<00:03:01.010> thing<00:03:01.660> basic

and so the detail on this thing basic

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.780 
and so the detail on this thing basic
there's<00:03:02.870> none<00:03:03.020> really<00:03:03.410> extra<00:03:03.680> parts<00:03:03.950> other

there's none really extra parts other

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.850 
there's none really extra parts other

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039 
which as see if we can get it to focus a

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:18.770 
which as see if we can get it to focus a
little<00:05:17.130> more<00:05:17.280> it's<00:05:17.880> so<00:05:18.000> much<00:05:18.210> more<00:05:18.419> light<00:05:18.660> in

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780

but<00:05:25.660> um<00:05:26.139> there's<00:05:27.009> even<00:05:27.280> detail<00:05:27.610> underneath<00:05:28.000> it

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
but um there's even detail underneath it

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
controller which is about right there

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:09.420 
controller which is about right there
well<00:06:05.500> it's<00:06:05.710> a<00:06:05.770> little<00:06:05.889> more<00:06:06.009> may<00:06:06.310> 35<00:06:06.819> but<00:06:08.430> this

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:09.430 
well it's a little more may 35 but this

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:14.430 
well it's a little more may 35 but this
is<00:06:09.550> the<00:06:09.639> speed<00:06:09.909> it<00:06:10.030> would<00:06:10.120> go<00:06:10.270> at<00:06:13.169> that's<00:06:14.169> about

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:14.440 
is the speed it would go at that's about

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.959 
is the speed it would go at that's about
it<00:06:14.650> and<00:06:14.770> it<00:06:14.889> runs<00:06:14.979> very<00:06:15.190> smoothly

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:15.969 
it and it runs very smoothly

it and it runs very smoothly
I'm<00:06:16.509> very<00:06:16.780> few<00:06:17.050> connection<00:06:17.440> problems
