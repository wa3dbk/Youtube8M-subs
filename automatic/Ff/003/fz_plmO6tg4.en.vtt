00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:39.829
 the respective mentors it's not the end 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.829
 of the world cabaye malouda 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:01:17.750
 another step has been taken in 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.310
 cruise product development 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.750
 to the islands of the madeleine with 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.850
 the inauguration of the terminal 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:27.350
 ok cap-aux-meules the ctm group has in 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.729
 consultation with the different 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.770
 partners is happy to have 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.590
 greatly contributed to the establishment 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.030
 of this infrastructure 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.330
 the purpose of this element eventually 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.910
 was to endow the archipelago determining 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.530
 of reception pavilion and kept 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.380
 his magnifying glass if the purpose of different 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.930
 partners it is to serve a little bit of 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.080
 not well transition for 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.060
 and two batches the facilities for the 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.160
 different cruise clienteles either 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.520
 national or customer base of these 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.160
 themes 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.520
 so we have all the facilities inside 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:03.560
 need internet services 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.750
 furniture to sit for for 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.390
 wait we also have a counter 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.690
 to give information 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:15.530
 to better orient passengers 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.330
 visitors for a long time we wanted 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.459
 have the terminal actually to be able to 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.860
 enrich this experience and the lines 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.450
 cruise asks us to have a 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.550
 place place of welcome a place that was 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.810
 conducive to welcoming people but 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.520
 especially we can have a service 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.530
 of internet that we can know a certain 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.090
 services inside the terminal that 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.700
 that we can finally offer passengers 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.770
 who are either in transition to 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.110
 green the stopover or to 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.000
 back to the ship is to have a 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.320
 terminal like this it represents 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.209
 I think we could hope for better 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.530
 is a collaboration also that was 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.239
 essential with the group it's so 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:52.730
 to be able to offer this experience 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:53.750
 to people to cross international the 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.730
 madeleine islands are a 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.680
 destination increasingly popular with 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.570
 cruise lines and the establishment of the 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.670
 terminal is definitely a tool of 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:05.380
 more to promote the development of this component 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.380
 of the tourist industry of the archipelago 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.920
 must understand that god customer is 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.230
 the international crusaders there are between 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.400
 above that are bacon so the 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.660
 boats that are still bigger 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:19.850
 rate shuttle fares is often so 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.739
 apparently good time but need 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.780
 of a place to be welcomed because 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.760
 that they will wait for them to be their 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.620
 excursions or their time to go 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.630
 discover the islands 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.820
 so it becomes interesting for his 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.110
 customers such lot is succinctly welcomed 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.430
 like the crusaders it was a word or 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.530
 other international crusaders who 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.540
 come to ass it allows some 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.489
 transition also to take advantage of 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.850
 various excursions finally by our 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.620
 partners 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.840
 already we were the first ones to 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.760
 to occupy it a few days from Thursday 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.560
 reindeer or the building was over on 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.830
 occupied the premises for the 2012 season 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.630
 is really we saw the day and the night 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.190
 with one operated in a marquee 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.780
 previously operating in a 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.370
 terminal that were specially designed 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.290
 for except for the passengers for 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.640
 welcome passengers 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.320
 the experience is really it was a 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.270
 very rewarding experience as much 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.450
 for us that for the passengers of 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:11.430
 crossbred international so this is a 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.810
 tool very nice tool it's a door 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.580
 entry into the bottom that will us 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.580
 to serve customers well
