 that many of our is going through 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.949
 this moment because several have said 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.350
 that if it already came out thing that is a lie mike 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.960
 the book edition does not yet date the 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.479
 Output is approximately July 29 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:08.020
 but then they fall behind so it's possible 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:10.659
 make it July 31 or July 29 sando 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.010

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.229
 I want to talk and also a small 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.970
 information about what this will bring 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:19.150
