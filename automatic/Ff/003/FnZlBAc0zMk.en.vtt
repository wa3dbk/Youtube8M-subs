00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:23.159 
I and I'm not gonna sit here and call it

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:24.770 
I and I'm not gonna sit here and call it
a<00:03:23.220> surprise<00:03:23.370> but<00:03:23.879> it's<00:03:24.150> nice<00:03:24.269> to<00:03:24.420> get<00:03:24.510> off<00:03:24.569> for

about how well you guys cycle the

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.809 
about how well you guys cycle the
your<00:03:30.989> line<00:03:31.200> how<00:03:31.799> how<00:03:32.189> do<00:03:32.250> you<00:03:32.340> work<00:03:32.489> on<00:03:32.640> that

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
your line how how do you work on that

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:34.970 
your line how how do you work on that
you<00:03:32.970> talked<00:03:33.329> about<00:03:33.360> it<00:03:33.780> a<00:03:33.840> lot<00:03:33.989> yeah<00:03:34.680> a<00:03:34.709> lot<00:03:34.920> of

you talked about it a lot yeah a lot of

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.530 
you talked about it a lot yeah a lot of
communication<00:03:35.610> I<00:03:35.760> think<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.060> biggest<00:03:36.390> thing

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
communication I think the biggest thing

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:37.789 
communication I think the biggest thing
for<00:03:36.659> us<00:03:36.840> is<00:03:36.900> trying<00:03:37.290> to<00:03:37.349> get<00:03:37.470> that<00:03:37.590> chemistry

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
for us is trying to get that chemistry

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.800 
for us is trying to get that chemistry
is<00:03:38.099> a<00:03:38.159> line<00:03:38.400> where<00:03:38.640> you<00:03:39.120> don't<00:03:39.239> have<00:03:39.359> to<00:03:39.629> turn

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
is a line where you don't have to turn

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.240 
is a line where you don't have to turn
and<00:03:40.079> look<00:03:40.200> to<00:03:40.379> make<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:40.650> play<00:03:40.769> because<00:03:41.010> guys

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
and look to make the play because guys

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.460 
and look to make the play because guys
are<00:03:41.280> too<00:03:41.549> good<00:03:41.579> positionally<00:03:42.390> they'll<00:03:43.260> cover

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
are too good positionally they'll cover

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.589 
are too good positionally they'll cover
it<00:03:43.709> it's<00:03:44.220> got<00:03:44.430> to<00:03:44.549> be<00:03:44.670> a<00:03:44.939> little<00:03:45.239> bit<00:03:45.480> of<00:03:45.540> that

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
it it's got to be a little bit of that

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:47.300 
it it's got to be a little bit of that
innate<00:03:46.260> sense<00:03:46.620> where<00:03:46.920> you<00:03:47.010> know<00:03:47.099> where<00:03:47.220> the

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
innate sense where you know where the

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.160 
innate sense where you know where the
guy<00:03:47.459> is<00:03:47.489> so<00:03:47.939> you<00:03:48.420> play<00:03:48.629> off<00:03:48.750> each<00:03:48.780> other's

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
guy is so you play off each other's

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.990 
guy is so you play off each other's
tanks<00:03:49.500> and<00:03:49.680> when<00:03:49.829> do<00:03:49.950> you<00:03:49.980> know<00:03:50.129> to<00:03:50.189> attack<00:03:50.819> the

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
tanks and when do you know to attack the

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.300 
tanks and when do you know to attack the
net<00:03:51.150> though<00:03:51.329> I<00:03:51.599> tried<00:03:52.590> popping<00:03:52.859> that<00:03:53.069> over<00:03:53.280> a

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
net though I tried popping that over a

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.319 
net though I tried popping that over a
little<00:03:53.430> bit<00:03:53.579> when<00:03:53.730> they<00:03:53.790> get<00:03:53.909> their<00:03:54.090> head<00:03:54.239> up

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
little bit when they get their head up

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.750 
little bit when they get their head up
and<00:03:54.569> if<00:03:55.230> it's<00:03:55.829> like<00:03:55.950> I<00:03:56.040> covered<00:03:56.340> up<00:03:56.400> there<00:03:56.609> than

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
and if it's like I covered up there than

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.160 
and if it's like I covered up there than
I<00:03:56.849> attacking<00:03:57.269> that<00:03:57.359> hope<00:03:57.599> you<00:03:57.720> lose<00:03:57.900> somebody

themselves some time with the clock this
is<00:04:03.030> a<00:04:03.060> special<00:04:03.269> connection<00:04:03.659> this<00:04:03.959> line<00:04:04.170> seems

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
is a special connection this line seems

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.530 
is a special connection this line seems
to<00:04:04.620> have<00:04:04.769> this<00:04:04.920> is<00:04:05.099> a<00:04:05.129> some<00:04:06.030> cycling<00:04:06.389> that

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:08.570 
that trade has turned out for them and

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.360 
that trade has turned out for them and
if<00:06:08.930> you're<00:06:09.080> given<00:06:09.320> what<00:06:09.440> you're<00:06:09.590> doing<00:06:09.800> with

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.370 
if you're given what you're doing with

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.469 
if you're given what you're doing with
the<00:06:10.490> Kings<00:06:10.700> right<00:06:10.880> now<00:06:11.030> but<00:06:11.180> I<00:06:11.210> guess<00:06:11.360> the

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:11.479 
the Kings right now but I guess the

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:12.760 
the Kings right now but I guess the
question<00:06:11.600> is<00:06:11.900> this<00:06:12.050> has<00:06:12.410> it<00:06:12.560> ever<00:06:12.650> crossed

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:12.770 
question is this has it ever crossed

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:15.070 
question is this has it ever crossed
your<00:06:13.070> mind<00:06:13.370> how<00:06:13.880> close<00:06:14.240> you<00:06:14.419> came<00:06:14.600> to<00:06:14.660> playing

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.080 
your mind how close you came to playing

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.170 
your mind how close you came to playing
in<00:06:15.229> your<00:06:15.320> hometown<00:06:15.580> yes<00:06:16.580> and<00:06:16.729> no<00:06:16.850> like<00:06:17.060> I<00:06:17.150> said

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 
it said it on the board but I know the

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.630 
it said it on the board but I know the
fact<00:06:18.740> of<00:06:18.830> the<00:06:18.890> matter<00:06:18.979> is<00:06:19.160> that<00:06:19.220> was<00:06:19.430> just<00:06:19.580> a

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:19.640 
fact of the matter is that was just a

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.370 
fact of the matter is that was just a
ship<00:06:19.880> that<00:06:19.910> they<00:06:20.570> might<00:06:20.750> or<00:06:20.930> might<00:06:20.960> not<00:06:21.110> have

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:21.380 
ship that they might or might not have

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:26.080 
ship that they might or might not have

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.090 
taken doing so ah I guess maybe it's
