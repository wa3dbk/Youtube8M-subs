00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
lane splitter this is 99 cents on the

lane splitter this is 99 cents on the
App<00:00:06.720> Store<00:00:06.750> and<00:00:07.589> it<00:00:07.740> actually<00:00:07.950> helped<00:00:08.400> kill

App Store and it actually helped kill

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.879 
App Store and it actually helped kill
quite<00:00:09.660> a<00:00:09.690> bit<00:00:09.870> of<00:00:09.960> time<00:00:09.990> when<00:00:10.290> I<00:00:10.349> was<00:00:10.469> on<00:00:10.590> a<00:00:10.650> road

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
quite a bit of time when I was on a road

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.890 
quite a bit of time when I was on a road
trip<00:00:10.920> a<00:00:11.370> couple<00:00:11.429> weeks<00:00:11.940> ago<00:00:12.059> so<00:00:12.660> let's<00:00:12.780> go

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
trip a couple weeks ago so let's go

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.620 
trip a couple weeks ago so let's go
ahead<00:00:12.929> and<00:00:13.139> take<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.559> look<00:00:13.650> at<00:00:13.889> it<00:00:14.630> lane

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630

ahead and take a look at it lane
splitter<00:00:15.929> really<00:00:16.289> does<00:00:16.470> follow<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:17.130> three

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
splitter really does follow the three

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.760 
splitter really does follow the three
principles<00:00:18.029> of<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.449> App<00:00:18.570> Store<00:00:18.619> make<00:00:19.619> it

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
principles of the App Store make it

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.400 
principles of the App Store make it
simple<00:00:20.039> make<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:20.970> addictive<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:21.900> make<00:00:22.230> it

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
simple make it addictive and make it

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.540 
simple make it addictive and make it
cheap<00:00:23.660> the<00:00:24.660> controls<00:00:25.199> are<00:00:25.529> very<00:00:25.590> very<00:00:26.189> simple

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
cheap the controls are very very simple

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.939 
cheap the controls are very very simple
all<00:00:26.849> you<00:00:26.910> have<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.390> do<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:27.779> tilt<00:00:28.140> left<00:00:28.680> and

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
all you have to do is tilt left and

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.420 
all you have to do is tilt left and
right<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.580> avoid<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.210> oncoming<00:00:30.689> traffic<00:00:31.430> now

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
right to avoid the oncoming traffic now

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.280 
right to avoid the oncoming traffic now
this<00:00:32.579> sounds<00:00:32.759> simple<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.450> it<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:33.930> for<00:00:34.200> the

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
this sounds simple and it is for the

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.920 
this sounds simple and it is for the
first<00:00:34.530> minute<00:00:34.890> or<00:00:35.010> two<00:00:35.430> but<00:00:36.180> as<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.540> game<00:00:36.570> goes

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
first minute or two but as the game goes

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.260 
first minute or two but as the game goes
on<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.500> progressively<00:00:37.920> ramps<00:00:38.579> up<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.940> speed

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
on it progressively ramps up the speed

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.619 
on it progressively ramps up the speed
so<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:39.570> becomes<00:00:39.870> even<00:00:40.469> more<00:00:40.500> difficult<00:00:41.629> you

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
so it becomes even more difficult you

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.270 
so it becomes even more difficult you
can<00:00:42.809> also<00:00:42.989> speed<00:00:43.379> your<00:00:43.559> motorcycle<00:00:44.129> up

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
can also speed your motorcycle up

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.910 
can also speed your motorcycle up
yourself<00:00:44.820> by<00:00:45.420> pressing<00:00:45.930> anywhere<00:00:46.530> on<00:00:46.739> the

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
yourself by pressing anywhere on the

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.100 
yourself by pressing anywhere on the
screen<00:00:47.420> doing<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.539> with<00:00:48.719> this<00:00:48.870> character

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
screen doing that with this character

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.080 
screen doing that with this character
makes<00:00:49.590> him<00:00:49.800> pop<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.039> wheelie<00:00:50.340> but<00:00:50.850> with<00:00:50.940> other

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
makes him pop a wheelie but with other

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.760 
makes him pop a wheelie but with other
characters<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.750> makes<00:00:51.930> them<00:00:52.140> go<00:00:52.469> full

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
characters it makes them go full

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.470 
characters it makes them go full
throttle<00:00:52.800> or<00:00:53.399> another<00:00:53.640> power<00:00:53.879> up<00:00:54.120> we'll<00:00:54.360> talk

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
throttle or another power up we'll talk

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.660 
throttle or another power up we'll talk
about<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.870> little<00:00:54.960> later<00:00:55.250> this<00:00:56.250> game<00:00:56.489> also

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
about that a little later this game also

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.029 
about that a little later this game also
employs<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.210> coin<00:00:57.570> system<00:00:57.989> where<00:00:58.379> as<00:00:58.649> you're

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
employs a coin system where as you're

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.080 
employs a coin system where as you're
going<00:00:59.190> through<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.460> tunnel<00:00:59.670> you<00:00:59.850> have<00:00:59.969> to

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
going through a tunnel you have to

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.299 
going through a tunnel you have to
collect<00:01:00.480> coins<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.440> can<00:01:01.710> spend<00:01:02.039> on

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
collect coins that you can spend on

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.149 
collect coins that you can spend on
upgrading<00:01:02.910> your<00:01:03.030> character<00:01:03.539> or<00:01:04.100> getting<00:01:05.100> a

new power up or upgrade as you work

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.280 
new power up or upgrade as you work
through<00:01:08.970> these<00:01:09.270> tunnels<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.869> you'll<00:01:10.020> find

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
through these tunnels that you'll find

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.380 
through these tunnels that you'll find
that<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.680> occasionally<00:01:11.130> have<00:01:11.369> traffic<00:01:11.909> and

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
that you occasionally have traffic and

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.730 
that you occasionally have traffic and
this<00:01:12.570> is<00:01:12.689> where<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.930> real<00:01:13.080> name<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.590> game

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
this is where the real name of the game

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.920 
this is where the real name of the game
comes<00:01:14.070> in<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.700> have<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.970> split<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.689> lanes

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
comes in you have to split the lanes

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.830 
comes in you have to split the lanes
between<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.530> cars<00:01:16.799> in<00:01:17.130> order<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.729> survive<00:01:17.939> now

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
between the cars in order to survive now

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.330 
between the cars in order to survive now
just<00:01:19.080> one<00:01:19.320> nudge<00:01:19.619> will<00:01:19.860> knock<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.189> off<00:01:20.220> your

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
just one nudge will knock you off your

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.240 
just one nudge will knock you off your
bike<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.909> end<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.810> level<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.830> really

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
bike and end the level so you really

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.499 
bike and end the level so you really
don't<00:01:23.430> want<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.640> do<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:23.820> now<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.299> may<00:01:24.390> not

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
don't want to do that now it may not

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.760 
don't want to do that now it may not
look<00:01:24.659> like<00:01:24.720> I'm<00:01:24.960> doing<00:01:25.259> anything<00:01:25.470> right<00:01:25.710> now

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
look like I'm doing anything right now

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.590 
look like I'm doing anything right now
just<00:01:26.070> holding<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.460> still<00:01:26.670> but<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.210> tell<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.479> it

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
just holding it still but I tell you it

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.370 
just holding it still but I tell you it
takes<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.930> lot<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.470> concentration<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.400> do<00:01:29.610> this

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
takes a lot of concentration to do this

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.929 
takes a lot of concentration to do this
so<00:01:31.380> pretty<00:01:31.530> much<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.070> lane<00:01:32.310> splitter<00:01:32.700> in

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
so pretty much that is lane splitter in

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.730 
so pretty much that is lane splitter in
a<00:01:33.210> nutshell<00:01:33.479> there<00:01:34.110> are<00:01:34.229> some<00:01:34.380> other<00:01:34.530> features

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
a nutshell there are some other features

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.450 
a nutshell there are some other features
that<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.520> don't<00:01:36.119> really<00:01:36.360> care<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.869> go<00:01:37.110> into<00:01:37.460> but

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
that I don't really care to go into but

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.090 
that I don't really care to go into but
it<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.729> fun<00:01:39.030> game<00:01:39.060> for<00:01:39.270> 99<00:01:39.810> cents<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.829> can't

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
it is a fun game for 99 cents you can't
