00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.540
 download also a pack of icons that 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.909

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.850
 change them by ones identical to those of

 wallpapers sorry for android you like in 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.960
 the officers that we have seen in the 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:26.290
 presentation in the google there is out of 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.990

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.310
 average of 4 with 6 the keyboard is going to be 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.890
 what are you watching here on screen 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.380
 but later we will talk more 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.090
 background so now let's see what 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.780
 are going to be the configurations that we're going 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.640
 to have to run on our side 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.010
 to begin let's select noval 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.050
 launcher as the predefined for each 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.730
 once we touch the home button and 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.190
 then we will go to configurations of 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.960
 again once we're there in what 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.370
 it's being a desk we're going to 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.090
 select the search bar 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.950
 permanent android 4.4 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.930
 we go 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.360
 widget and what we are going to be able to do with 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.940
 this bar is to have them permanently 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.239
 all the pages of our desktop 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.069
 no matter what scroll we do besides 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.959
 of this configuration we are going to execute 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.030
 one in the dogout in the drawer of 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.400
 applications where it's been in 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.650
 what eyelash style eyelashes 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.540
 small and we will see that this what 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.280
 effect is a change in what the 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.250
 two buttons that we had previously 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.310
 that said widgets and applications for a 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.280
 strong infinity between widgets 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:48.690
 like all the applications that we have 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:52.170
 that after doing this we are going to install 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.840
 or better place the icon pack 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.060
 let's go to appearance we have to 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.069
 icons that we're going to select a chan and 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.890
 once we have done this we go 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.780
 to home and we see that it starts to load 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.450
 all the symbols for these a little more 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.730
 plans that google taught us in the 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.620
 google input output 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.049
 if there is an application that does not change 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.510
 as for example to me the camera we are going 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:18.450
 to edit we select the image we 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.209
 we are sliding down to saint jacques and 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.250
 we select the icon of the camera that 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.920
 more we like and we will have between I think 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.440
 there are 300 icons to hide but let's go 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.799
 to change for example the home button 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.140
 by the android in its version l 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:37.140
 we select the blanquito and we give it 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:40.440
 although there is good here we see that already 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:43.140
 we have all to the appearance by 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.709
 so to say it on android l but now 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.959
 let's add the google ok function 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:52.709
 from anywhere in our 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:54.989
 device we go to where it says ok wood and 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.310
 we activate it and this what it is going to do is 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.240
 that anywhere in the launcher 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:02.060
 when we say ok google 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.880
 automatically there will not be no listen 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.000
 to be able to choose what we want 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.690
 we say 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.130
 ok google and open it directly without 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.500
 import in what part of the unter 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.870
 so let's see how 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.930
 select the keyboard and so we go 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.720
 finishing the custom we are going to 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.510
 select the android keyboard l for 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.460
 see how we can write as 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.040
 select it as predefined we enter 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.680
 to the application and it's going to show us 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.320
 some changes that we can make in 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.570
 our device you just have to 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.300
 give it as pre decided and select it 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.220
 as a writing method and ready 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.220
 our device will now be 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.380
 using this keyboard as predefined 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:49.310
 we see that here we have to also the 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:53.060
 usual keyboard where sliding black 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:54.240
 between the different letters we will be able to 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.970
 go typing 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.419
 we have done in this way we are going to 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:02.160
 write everything we want 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:04.740
 directly sliding our disc 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.319
 our finger between the screen of the 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.810
 device that is a pretty keyboard 

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:12.000

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:15.000
 several languages the truth quite well 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.090

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.150
 be able to select different languages 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:23.039
 plus one more if we enter 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.990
