00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:12.269
 hello friends we are here in development 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:15.599
 where I'm right that I'm not the same is 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.660
 that the stores have given away the old 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.480
 well let's develop the new 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.060
 new 4cast good because this is very 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.570
 easy I got all the points 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.840
 dead of solÃ­s 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:33.690
 tolo calafat expedition to because I 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.550
 spent 500 euros of a console for 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.220
 that after a year and a half they know one thing 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.170
 the new good one that ended up 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:44.620
 turn off the console 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.980
 I leave you as a result more in the table 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.910
 Well, you see, I'm totally 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.600
 outraged with everything that is happening 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.430
 is busted consoles pity that no 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.750
 had an xbox i have team voice 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.699
 lost broken 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.160
 I did not buy a full my 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.690
 teams and I spent a thousand euros and a 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.550
 moment for now a year and a half 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.580
 then come saying that they are going to 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:09.490
 change the console for a better though 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.970
 they are camouflaging it from something else 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.530
 one thing first of all please 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.860
 share this video do not stay 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.660
 impassive and leave for each the subject 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.460
 share it for astute gentlemen me 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.899
 I complain about you but the 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.360
 benefit for you ask you to share 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:27.759
 ok I do not agree I 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.490
 directly looking at you in your 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.960
 sound and microsoft managers 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.270
 especially in case someone is that 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.030
 I'm from Microsoft because you can not 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.369
 do this look at the excuse is that they say 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.649
 what is netflix asks you to look 4k 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.390
 that I remember 4k you could see in 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:44.979
 these consoles or is it action 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.530
 initial specifications that 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.950
 They commented long before 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.320
 launch the console 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.210
 but it is the case that netflix does not 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.460
 is in the whole world and there is also the 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.340
 case that there is not happy yet not 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.200
 transmits in 4k but is that nobody is going to 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.020
 see four each online if it's with 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.380
 imagenio in spain at 1080 720 and you 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:09.530
 you are offline if it is not no 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.440
 is feasible is not efficient is a 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.780
 supported very large or me when I see 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.989
 online content with a good 720 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.030
 encoded a 1080 already as shown I'll 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.610
 more than four hours to spare 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.560
 so that not in the excuse they used 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.019
 they too what a chip is 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.760
 traffic to break into many that 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.040
 speak in the console war that yes 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.590
 this typical cpu memory that comes close 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.599
 that's shit, we've already seen that 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.920
 after a year and a half the commissions 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:39.079
 they still have the problem of slowness 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.260
 that hangs by many applications 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:44.690
 that you put my xbox one console worth 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.630
 a lot where they will not be connected 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.250
 depends that the game is an endless 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.489
 history also of the games acacho 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.880
 they are stealing us in a legal way from a 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.730
 totally way 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.040
 but this is going to happen with the 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.590
 time to see classes within the 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.740
 all games to beat a game of anger 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.050
 if you have 4k you will see the scenes in 4k and 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.600
 if you do not have 4 for the expected of 1080 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.450
 I do not care either but it 's the kind of 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.550
 class that gives you the hierarchy so no 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.410
 I want to think well be like before the 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.420
 moon console 45 years that was what 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.880
 they said they are for six years not 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.770
 you can change the specifications you 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.740
 you can not camouflage that you are going to change 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:29.640
 all the graphic chipset of a console 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:32.250
 simply simply 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.069
 because it's crap that you put in your 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.890
 day and now I have to eat that 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.780
 shit raze that shit and others it 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.880
 buy the new new console 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.610
 generation surely at the best price 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.860
 that me and they laugh in my whole face 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.200
 to compensate me guys are going to give us 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:52.560
 a couple of fires surely and I 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:56.130
 I fall into your fucking mother of teams and 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:04:00.930
 sony but like that but that's how it shrinks me 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:05.340
 subway all his fucking mother as the console 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:07.950
 and the bust that is that we are treated 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.470
 fools can not and so for life not 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.330
 is so asshole and I can not 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.430
 allow this to happen without lifting the 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.959
 voice at least I complained and if you 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.140
 you do not want to let me share the video 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:22.019
 please can not have a second 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:24.210
 second generation can not be reached 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.340
 this point can not treat us as a fool 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.280
 it's such a silly excuse because this 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.900
 now you have to buy 4k TV 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.510
 larger hard drives that occupies the 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.220
 double are and other brands live to sell 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.010
 there crisis does not sell 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.620
 As they do not sell they have to pay factories 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.720
 and hit for mortgages like not that 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.880
 stories are invented a few years ago 3ds 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.970
 sold little the truth is no longer spoken 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.950
 nothing of the train from now to the 4k by cojones 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.050
 we have to get 4k when four 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:54.050
 large cinema is used and used in 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.460
 television and it's used nowhere 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:59.040
 they are simply imposing it because 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:02.130
 if they impose it, we all have to change 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:04.650
 television with time consoles 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.990
 reproducers and everything if it's business 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.510
 for them and shit for us when 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.300
 with 1080 today we have for 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.370
 several years of and pulling at ease and from 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:18.420
 more than enough quality whether 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:21.090
 television console online or wherever and 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:26.220
 That is my opinion and my opinion is 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:28.140
 totally is that sony and microsoft know 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.600
 the chipset shit that he takes to his 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.790
 consoles and want to change stage of 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:36.030
 They want to change her with this whore 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:38.040
 ejected snow and I do not believe it and 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.930
