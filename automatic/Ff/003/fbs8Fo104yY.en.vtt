00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:19.880
 operations with heteros 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.859
 addition or subtraction of integers 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.260
 the positive numbers can have the sign of vice committed 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.189
 is right 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.859
 when its essence this operation 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:31.089
 for example 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:33.090
 if you have a number 2 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.270
 and this two is positive I do not need because the plus sign in front 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.740
 we introduced two positive ones simply those who saw two did not 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.740
 you need to write two more 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.460
 here is a case 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.520
 which is sad really unnecessary to write 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.730
 two more up ahead 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.360
 the only people we had will keep in the others the fall against two plus two 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.650
 the result is also positive 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.650
 We do not have to put the animals. 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.270
 that's why he writes 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.970
 two plus two goals 4 and no more two plus two goals with a further 4 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.850
 why is the sign that more 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.230
 it's already understood 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.020
 with respect to 0 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.270
 we have that nudge it's the real number one thousand fans 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.660
 it's not tax 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.760
 menagerie 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.620
 addition or subtraction of integers 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.850
 but now revealed if not the greatest 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.660
 We'll see you now. 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.600
 for example 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.390
 Let's go it was sad in 2005 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.670
 I know everyone knows about five more of the seven 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.880
 the moods in goiÃ¡s we come here 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.870
 what is the highest value here 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.030
 it's 2 o 5 o'clock 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.210
 few are the 5 positive 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.210
 so the result is also positive 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.130
 2-5 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.320
 - made the highest value 2 or 5 oral test 5 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.720
 another sign of negative 5 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.720
 so the signal is also negative 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.910
 two plus five 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.250
 big coca 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.800
 5 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.800
 as the positive cycle the result will also be positive 

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:15.479
 - 2-5 cc higher value 

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:16.619
 at 5 

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:19.169
 prisc result will be negative 

00:02:19.169 --> 00:02:21.680
 we can also think eventually 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.510
 in terms of profit or loss 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.789
 for example 

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:28.679
 if you have two reais and earn another five you got seven reais 

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:31.569
 if you had two reais 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.749
 only you lost 5 reais 

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:36.189
 You owed three 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:38.189
 if you were due three 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:40.949
 and you win so you got three 

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:43.749
 and if you lost 2 72 5 

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:46.749
 you lost seven 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:50.520
 multiplication of the viseu where it was 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.819
 in this case it was even what changes a little bit 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.699
 what will be the rule that we use are these rules this framework 

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:58.629
 below 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:00.279
 but like nothing else 

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:02.129
 but at least one less 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:05.129
 - with more than - - with less normal 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:08.069
 this is a rule 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.369
 here we are 

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:11.869
 were thought of as follows 

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:15.290
 people associate more with me - with kimi migo 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.290
 Look, only my friend's friend is my friend. 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.849
 My clinician's friend is my enemy. 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.869
 the enemy of my father's monkey is my enemy 

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:28.869
 the enemy of my enemy is my dear friend 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:33.129
 we will see that 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.089
 it was very unintuitive 

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:41.549
 so we'll do a demo - video responses 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.979
 or proof where we prove that 

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:48.009
 any number 2 when we are guilty of negative numbers with the 

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:49.919
 their product forever 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:52.929
 the positive number 

00:03:52.929 --> 00:03:55.309
 we will see then astro demonstration of this 

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:58.009
 in responses to civilians 

00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:01.469
 multiplication or division of whole examples 

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:04.469
 here we have a case in 2 times three of six 

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:09.419
 two more times three more more to give more 

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:13.169
 more with less doha - 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:15.509
 we are older 

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:18.120
 and - naval commands 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.269
 are two of those three out of six 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.749
 two more months - 3 but less 

00:04:22.749 --> 00:04:24.439
 note - 6 

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:27.860
 - 2 with three more - with more 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.559
 but at -6 

00:04:29.559 --> 00:04:32.930
 river - two with me has been multiplying by 1-3 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.930
 - we will eat 6 more 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:40.389
 multiplication representations some of the vehicles 

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:43.419
 here we have both clubs 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:44.590
 only three 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.590
 these wine it is very little used nowadays because 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.219
 because if you write for example five times this 

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:54.150
 bes says if we present another way 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.969
 can be mistaken for x 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:58.879
 with whistles and favorite season 

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:00.379
 it's the dot 

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:03.909
 so two months three and I will not be present with an x â€‹â€‹I go 

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:06.909
 represent with 

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:10.749
 I can also be an actress of multiplication through the absence of 

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:11.539
 a signal 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:12.949
 5x 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:15.930
 It's like you're five months old x 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.309
 here but I think in that case 

00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:20.629
 Yes, of course. 

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:25.150
 and take your doubts as multiplication adopted as the cyno too 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.190
 I have two sons and it gets complicated stopped the man who multiplication 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.279
 where I did 

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:32.900
 That's why we prefer the point 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.999
 absence of signal 

00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:38.330
 here we have 1 - in front 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:39.930
 of a parenthesis 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.500
 always when he is or less in front of a parenthesis with seven in the south 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:45.199
 and in the south 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:47.470
 also multiplying all relatives 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.479
 so for example 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:54.070
 supporters 2 + 2 two plus two with the system s - south times 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:55.909
 two plus two 

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:58.909
 - or sometimes computers but two 4 

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:00.969
 - one of the 4 floor 

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:03.189
 - 4 

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:06.479
 or 46 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:09.529
 There will always be parentheses as we played little 

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:13.619
 I will have refused what I will think as if I had 

00:06:13.619 --> 00:06:17.169
 multiplying the number that was small parenthesis 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:19.569
 the project - as relatives of the two 

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:22.389
 it's as if you had one less of those two 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:24.219
 - 2 

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:25.970
 - all three of us 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.860
 it is as if it had - or that it multiplies 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.870
 2 + 3 or less one that explains to me 5 - there was yes that will give - 5 

00:06:35.559 --> 00:06:38.270
 and it was here 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.759
 to make us do some accounts is good we take into consideration 

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:43.249
 some concepts 

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:44.639
 considering that I am 

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:47.539
 what points do we start to make first 

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:51.839
 first then we knew what's inside the relatives then we do 

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:54.199
 multiplications or divisions 

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:57.469
 and lastly we make assomasul substations 

00:06:57.469 --> 00:07:00.250
 the example below 

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:02.080
 - 2 + 3 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.649
 times 4 

00:07:03.649 --> 00:07:05.379
 2005 

00:07:05.379 --> 00:07:07.689
 How do we solve this expression? 

00:07:07.689 --> 00:07:10.689
 First of all I'm going to sort out what's inside the relative's 

00:07:11.539 --> 00:07:14.759
 so I believe my father did we have - 2 + 3 

00:07:15.279 --> 00:07:16.139
 with us 

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:18.259
 has a sum takes the larger balance 

00:07:18.259 --> 00:07:20.569
 - 2 + 3 will give 

00:07:20.569 --> 00:07:22.139
 positive 

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:25.389
 and here 2/5 is going to be 7 jaqueline era 

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:27.089
 2+ 5 7 

00:07:27.089 --> 00:07:29.669
 so will you stay 

00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:31.669
 or rather we touched 

00:07:31.669 --> 00:07:34.050
 4-7 

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:37.050
 I realized then that I resolved all that was within kin 

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.689
 What am I going to do now? 

00:07:39.689 --> 00:07:43.069
 after the treasure to in viseu for this same it becomes actions with decisions 

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:48.179
 then we have here a multiplication given at least one of these 4 

00:07:48.179 --> 00:07:50.250
 What will I do before I do? 

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:51.789
 a subtraction 

00:07:51.789 --> 00:07:54.020
 twist - or times 4 

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:56.909
 - with more going to give - 

00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:59.499
 outlet - 4 

00:07:59.499 --> 00:08:01.009
 - 7 

00:08:01.009 --> 00:08:02.869
 4-7 

00:08:02.869 --> 00:08:04.759
 is vital and gratin greater 

00:08:04.759 --> 00:08:06.370
 it is not the greatest number 7 right 

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:07.669
 - 7 

00:08:07.669 --> 00:08:10.930
 is less 4-7 going to give - 11 

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:13.379
 them the people 

00:08:13.379 --> 00:08:14.009
 then that's it
