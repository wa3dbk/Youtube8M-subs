 we're going to see how to make with 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:22.220
 this special colored sand these 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.570
 my little boxes where we can put the 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.789
 our Christmas gifts 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.009
 in the kit that I link to below we have the 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.269
 little box of the little angel the little box 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.060

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.739
 the little box of the reindeer the little box 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.690
 of the cute penguin and then the 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.059
 box that we're going to do today or 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.070
 box of Santa Claus boxes where there 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.230
 we can put a little gift for the 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.149
 our friends 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.370
 the working method is always that of 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.710
 sade rally for the design or we have 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.989
 a sheet from which to take off thanks 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.969
 to the reckless to always put on 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.710
 always under our tray for not 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.539
 soil with sand and recover the 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.640
 sand days are the rallye I said to you 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:02.179
 we have our spelli colino with which 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.190
 go and remove all the paper for 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:06.170
 leave under the adhesive surface 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.330
 where we will go color by color a 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.130
 to fill his drawing we leave to 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.810
 example at the beginning with red like 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.650
 see I apply it then slightly 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:18.320
 pushing lightly with your finger and like 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.390
 see gives us a homogeneous surface e 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.670
 even slightly glittered he salted to 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.580
 this luminous effect precisely for the 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:29.660
 marble from which quality it comes from 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.730
 crumbled then I go to spectacular the 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:35.150
 green as you see or super accelerated the 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:37.220
 filmed and I remove all the parts are 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.590
 don't take away the ones I need 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.590
 to close the little box then from sac via 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.840
 with the green slowly I pass over the 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.390
 my saccarello we leave the tip about 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.800
 half a centimeter not sticky flies 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.050
 I recommend going to do light 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.760
 finger pressure and so I find myself at 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.260
 I had everything available 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.750
 forgot some red as you see 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.820
 I make a little adjustment now on 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.370
 nose in the Santa Claus song then 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.950
 the face of Santa Claus I start first with 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.160
 black eyes then pins face the face 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.679
 pink here is her rose 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.329
 ok up attack as far as i can 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.830
 look like the saga cleans up the 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:14.680
 all 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.940
 and then I go to concentrate on the one up 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.190
 what is the box as you see 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.930
 I can easily separate the 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.120
 little box from what is the support 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.040
 sand rally without absolutely 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.740
 ruin everything and then take advantage of it 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.960
 surfaces exactly to exile and for 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.000
 attach the various pieces to the dancing beard 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.150
 new father's hat 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.340
 Christmas then I peel the various pieces that 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.870
 I will need them to easily compose the 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.300
 box is really very intuitive 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.250
 realize the little box inside 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.590
 then we can put our gift 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.540
 really the mysterious astragalus for i 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.400
 our friends and then they are so 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.110
 funny resignation is small 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.700
 and honestly I thought as well as for the 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.830
 even gifts to use them as 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.340
 own decoration of the next tree 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.650
 Christmas 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.880
 so here is the sabe mini box 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.130
 Christmas rally 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.720
 I greet you next time I leave you here 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.940
 in the link all the information on 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.940
