00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.510 

let's<00:00:01.500> get<00:00:01.650> some<00:00:01.829> practice<00:00:02.040> drawing

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
let's get some practice drawing

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.970 
let's get some practice drawing
cyclohexane<00:00:03.330> chairs<00:00:03.600> we<00:00:04.500> have<00:00:04.620> one<00:00:04.770> drawn

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
cyclohexane chairs we have one drawn

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.289 
cyclohexane chairs we have one drawn
here<00:00:05.279> and<00:00:05.490> you<00:00:05.609> can<00:00:05.759> see<00:00:05.940> right<00:00:06.060> away<00:00:06.150> that

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
here and you can see right away that

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.419 
here and you can see right away that
there's<00:00:06.660> two<00:00:06.930> distinct<00:00:07.410> types<00:00:07.560> of<00:00:07.919> hydrogen's

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
there's two distinct types of hydrogen's

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.209 
there's two distinct types of hydrogen's
on<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.820> cyclohexane<00:00:09.240> chair<00:00:09.830> the<00:00:10.830> ones<00:00:11.040> that

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
on the cyclohexane chair the ones that

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.190 
on the cyclohexane chair the ones that
are<00:00:11.309> drawn<00:00:11.550> in<00:00:11.670> yellow<00:00:11.849> are<00:00:12.240> pointing<00:00:13.080> either

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
are drawn in yellow are pointing either

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.910 
are drawn in yellow are pointing either
straight<00:00:13.710> up<00:00:13.920> or<00:00:13.980> straight<00:00:14.360> down<00:00:15.740> those<00:00:16.740> are

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
straight up or straight down those are

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.550 
straight up or straight down those are
described<00:00:17.340> as<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.580> axial<00:00:18.350> positions<00:00:19.350> or<00:00:19.529> the

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
described as the axial positions or the

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.130 
described as the axial positions or the
axial<00:00:20.070> hydrogen's<00:00:20.430> in<00:00:20.820> this<00:00:20.970> case<00:00:21.180> they're

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
axial hydrogen's in this case they're

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.960 
axial hydrogen's in this case they're
called<00:00:22.350> that<00:00:22.529> because<00:00:22.800> if<00:00:22.920> you<00:00:23.010> imagine<00:00:23.130> the

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
called that because if you imagine the

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.420 
called that because if you imagine the
axis<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:25.109> axis<00:00:25.590> going<00:00:25.980> through<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.340> center

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
axis and axis going through the center

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.609 
axis and axis going through the center
of<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.119> cyclohexane<00:00:27.480> they<00:00:28.320> would<00:00:28.470> be

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
of the cyclohexane they would be

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.030 
of the cyclohexane they would be
parallel<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.250> axis<00:00:30.500> when<00:00:31.500> we<00:00:31.679> go<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.859> draw

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
parallel to that axis when we go to draw

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.910 
parallel to that axis when we go to draw
this<00:00:32.309> will<00:00:32.550> note<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:33.410> the<00:00:34.410> chair<00:00:34.739> is<00:00:34.890> a

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
this will note that the chair is a

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.880 
this will note that the chair is a
zigzag<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.540> current<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.469> carbons<00:00:37.800> out

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
zigzag and the current the carbons out

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.130 
zigzag and the current the carbons out
of<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.010> zigzag<00:00:38.340> up<00:00:38.579> have<00:00:39.239> an<00:00:39.360> axial<00:00:39.750> straight<00:00:40.020> up

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
of a zigzag up have an axial straight up

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.240 
of a zigzag up have an axial straight up
and<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:41.690> carbons<00:00:42.690> are<00:00:42.780> zigzag<00:00:43.290> down<00:00:43.530> have<00:00:44.100> an

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
and that carbons are zigzag down have an

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.040 
and that carbons are zigzag down have an
axial<00:00:44.670> straight<00:00:44.910> down<00:00:45.149> so<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.690> can<00:00:45.840> see<00:00:45.960> that

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
axial straight down so you can see that

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.590 
axial straight down so you can see that
they're<00:00:46.230> alternating<00:00:46.590> carbons<00:00:47.450> the<00:00:48.450> other

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
they're alternating carbons the other

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.720 
they're alternating carbons the other
six<00:00:48.930> hydrogen's<00:00:49.440> drawn<00:00:49.710> in<00:00:49.890> white<00:00:50.129> are

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
six hydrogen's drawn in white are

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.000 
six hydrogen's drawn in white are
described<00:00:51.239> as<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.570> equatorial<00:00:52.110> hydrogen's

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
described as the equatorial hydrogen's

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.610 
described as the equatorial hydrogen's
now<00:00:53.370> these<00:00:53.550> are<00:00:53.760> ones<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.090> are<00:00:54.180> either

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
now these are ones that are either

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.910 
now these are ones that are either
slightly<00:00:55.620> down<00:00:55.860> or<00:00:56.370> slightly<00:00:57.030> up<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.920> they're

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
slightly down or slightly up and they're

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.590 
slightly down or slightly up and they're
described<00:00:59.399> as<00:00:59.579> like<00:00:59.699> equatorial<00:01:00.390> because

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
described as like equatorial because

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.780 
described as like equatorial because
they<00:01:00.750> go<00:01:00.930> around<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.500> equator<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:03.000> Ring

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
they go around the equator of the Ring

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.160 
they go around the equator of the Ring
so<00:01:05.790> when<00:01:05.909> we<00:01:06.000> go<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.180> draw<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.810> cyclohexane

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
so when we go to draw a cyclohexane

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.260 
so when we go to draw a cyclohexane
chair<00:01:07.710> well<00:01:08.130> notice<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:08.850> bond

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
chair well notice that this is bond

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.170 
chair well notice that this is bond
angle<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.780> at<00:01:10.619> first<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:11.070> treadle<00:01:11.340> carbon<00:01:11.760> 109.5

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
angle is at first a treadle carbon 109.5

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.109 
angle is at first a treadle carbon 109.5
so<00:01:12.930> that'll<00:01:13.110> be<00:01:13.200> out<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.350> little<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.970> the<00:01:14.970> other

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
so that'll be out a little and the other

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.390 
so that'll be out a little and the other
thing<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.540> want<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.869> point<00:01:16.049> out<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.530> that

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
thing that I want to point out is that

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.320 
thing that I want to point out is that
every<00:01:17.880> bond<00:01:18.530> drawn<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:19.920> going<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:21.030> with<00:01:21.240> the

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
every bond drawn is going to it with the

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.210 
every bond drawn is going to it with the
exception<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.049> axial<00:01:22.770> ones<00:01:22.890> which<00:01:23.100> are

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
exception of the axial ones which are

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.770 
exception of the axial ones which are
straight<00:01:23.430> up<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.729> down<00:01:23.759> every<00:01:24.150> other<00:01:24.270> bond<00:01:24.630> is

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
straight up and down every other bond is

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.810 
straight up and down every other bond is
going<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:24.990> be<00:01:25.049> parallel<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.860> another<00:01:26.460> bond

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
going to be parallel to another bond

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.420 
going to be parallel to another bond
that's<00:01:27.030> already<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:28.049> drawn<00:01:28.350> so<00:01:28.710> for<00:01:28.920> example

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
that's already and drawn so for example

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.370 
that's already and drawn so for example
in<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:30.060> cyclohexane<00:01:30.479> ring<00:01:31.290> this<00:01:32.040> bond<00:01:32.460> is

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
in the cyclohexane ring this bond is

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.590 
in the cyclohexane ring this bond is
parallel<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.799> this<00:01:34.950> bond<00:01:36.049> and<00:01:37.049> we<00:01:37.770> also<00:01:37.950> have

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
parallel to this bond and we also have

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.480 
parallel to this bond and we also have
these<00:01:39.600> two<00:01:39.659> bonds<00:01:40.170> being<00:01:41.040> parallel<00:01:41.899> and<00:01:43.490> then

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
these two bonds being parallel and then

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.609 
these two bonds being parallel and then
the<00:01:44.640> other<00:01:44.790> two<00:01:45.090> bonds<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.020> other<00:01:46.140> two<00:01:46.380> sets

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
the other two bonds the other two sets

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.429 
the other two bonds the other two sets
of<00:01:46.740> bonds<00:01:47.070> are<00:01:47.729> parallel<00:01:48.270> ok<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:48.899> if<00:01:49.140> we<00:01:49.290> notice

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
of bonds are parallel ok so if we notice

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.109 
of bonds are parallel ok so if we notice
that<00:01:49.710> in<00:01:49.890> this<00:01:49.979> drawing<00:01:50.250> that's<00:01:50.909> going<00:01:51.060> to

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
that in this drawing that's going to

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.319 
that in this drawing that's going to
help<00:01:51.240> us<00:01:51.420> draw<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.930> better<00:01:52.579> better<00:01:53.579> cyclohexane

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
help us draw a better better cyclohexane

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.920 
help us draw a better better cyclohexane
chair<00:01:54.619> okay<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:56.250> can<00:01:56.430> also<00:01:56.610> notice<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.390> we

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
chair okay you can also notice that we

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.510 
chair okay you can also notice that we
have<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.860> letter<00:01:59.070> W<00:01:59.369> here<00:02:01.009> so<00:02:02.009> this<00:02:02.250> is<00:02:02.490> a

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
have the letter W here so this is a

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.120 
have the letter W here so this is a
letter<00:02:02.790> W<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.509> back<00:02:04.380> here<00:02:04.619> we<00:02:04.649> have<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.890> letter

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
letter W and back here we have a letter

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.880 
letter W and back here we have a letter
M<00:02:05.930> here's<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:06.990> W<00:02:08.390> here's<00:02:09.390> an<00:02:09.569> M<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.649> when<00:02:10.739> we

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
M here's a W here's an M so when we

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:11.960 
M here's a W here's an M so when we
compare<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.459> position

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
compare the position

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.820 
compare the position
these<00:02:12.240> equatorial<00:02:12.870> hydrogen's<00:02:13.140> and<00:02:13.530> some<00:02:13.710> of

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
these equatorial hydrogen's and some of

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.940 
these equatorial hydrogen's and some of
the<00:02:13.920> carbon-carbon<00:02:14.730> bonds<00:02:15.270> in<00:02:15.450> the

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
the carbon-carbon bonds in the

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.060 
the carbon-carbon bonds in the
infrastructure<00:02:16.950> then<00:02:17.730> we<00:02:17.910> can<00:02:18.740> look<00:02:19.740> for<00:02:19.920> some

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
infrastructure then we can look for some

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.260 
infrastructure then we can look for some
patterns<00:02:20.400> they're<00:02:20.550> going<00:02:20.670> to<00:02:20.730> help<00:02:20.880> us<00:02:21.030> draw<00:02:21.240> a

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
patterns they're going to help us draw a

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.690 
patterns they're going to help us draw a
better<00:02:21.680> cyclohexane<00:02:22.680> chair<00:02:22.710> so<00:02:23.430> let's<00:02:23.550> put

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
better cyclohexane chair so let's put

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.190 
better cyclohexane chair so let's put
this<00:02:23.820> up<00:02:24.000> here<00:02:24.060> for<00:02:24.420> reference<00:02:24.600> so<00:02:24.960> we<00:02:25.050> can

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
this up here for reference so we can

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.800 
this up here for reference so we can
keep<00:02:25.320> an<00:02:25.500> eye<00:02:25.620> on<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.130> get<00:02:27.000> to<00:02:27.150> drawing<00:02:27.450> our

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
keep an eye on it and get to drawing our

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.270 
keep an eye on it and get to drawing our
own<00:02:29.180> chair<00:02:30.180> so<00:02:30.990> a<00:02:31.020> good<00:02:31.470> way<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.650> start<00:02:31.980> there's

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
own chair so a good way to start there's

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.890 
own chair so a good way to start there's
several<00:02:32.670> different<00:02:32.820> ways<00:02:33.120> you<00:02:33.270> can<00:02:33.360> start<00:02:33.660> but

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
several different ways you can start but

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.460 
several different ways you can start but
one<00:02:34.080> possibility<00:02:34.620> is<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.340> start<00:02:36.000> by<00:02:36.210> drawing<00:02:36.470> a

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
one possibility is to start by drawing a

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.950 
one possibility is to start by drawing a
little<00:02:37.950> bit<00:02:38.070> of<00:02:38.130> a<00:02:38.190> triangle<00:02:38.550> like<00:02:38.670> this<00:02:38.960> there

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
little bit of a triangle like this there

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.730 
little bit of a triangle like this there
are<00:02:40.050> going<00:02:40.110> to<00:02:40.290> draw<00:02:40.470> two<00:02:40.500> parallel<00:02:41.070> lines

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740 
are going to draw two parallel lines

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.080 
are going to draw two parallel lines
notice<00:02:43.740> their<00:02:44.070> start<00:02:44.400> at<00:02:44.520> their<00:02:44.640> ending

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
notice their start at their ending

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.060 
notice their start at their ending
slightly<00:02:45.810> staggered<00:02:46.050> to<00:02:46.350> one<00:02:46.440> another<00:02:46.680> and

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
slightly staggered to one another and

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.320 
slightly staggered to one another and
then<00:02:47.370> we're<00:02:47.459> going<00:02:47.580> to<00:02:47.610> draw<00:02:47.820> a<00:02:47.850> second

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
then we're going to draw a second

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.030 
then we're going to draw a second
triangle<00:02:49.020> and<00:02:50.300> remember<00:02:51.300> that<00:02:51.990> every<00:02:52.410> new

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
triangle and remember that every new

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.350 
triangle and remember that every new
bond<00:02:53.250> we're<00:02:53.430> going<00:02:53.580> to<00:02:53.640> form<00:02:53.910> is<00:02:54.090> going<00:02:54.180> to<00:02:54.300> be

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
bond we're going to form is going to be

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.690 
bond we're going to form is going to be
parallel<00:02:54.750> to<00:02:54.810> some<00:02:55.320> other<00:02:55.470> bonds<00:02:55.890> so<00:02:56.070> this

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
parallel to some other bonds so this

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.670 
parallel to some other bonds so this
bond<00:02:57.000> is<00:02:57.330> going<00:02:57.780> in<00:02:57.870> this<00:02:57.990> direction<00:02:58.050> so

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
bond is going in this direction so

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.520 
bond is going in this direction so
that's<00:02:59.310> where<00:02:59.580> our<00:02:59.610> next<00:02:59.930> angle<00:03:00.930> goes<00:03:01.140> and

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
that's where our next angle goes and

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.850 
that's where our next angle goes and
then<00:03:02.280> this<00:03:02.490> bond<00:03:02.850> is<00:03:03.440> going<00:03:04.440> to<00:03:04.500> be<00:03:04.560> parallel

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
then this bond is going to be parallel

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.720 
then this bond is going to be parallel
to<00:03:05.100> this<00:03:05.250> one<00:03:07.190> so<00:03:08.190> that's<00:03:08.370> going<00:03:08.490> to<00:03:08.550> be<00:03:08.640> our

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
to this one so that's going to be our

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.449 
to this one so that's going to be our
cyclohexane<00:03:09.450> chair<00:03:09.480> now<00:03:10.410> we<00:03:10.470> want<00:03:10.740> to<00:03:10.920> draw<00:03:11.160> in

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
cyclohexane chair now we want to draw in

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.180 
cyclohexane chair now we want to draw in
some<00:03:11.820> and<00:03:12.300> and<00:03:12.450> not<00:03:12.630> be<00:03:12.690> afraid<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:13.350> erase

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
some and and not be afraid to erase

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.770 
some and and not be afraid to erase
something<00:03:14.459> and<00:03:14.760> make<00:03:14.910> some<00:03:15.090> adjustments<00:03:15.180> if

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
something and make some adjustments if

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.360 
something and make some adjustments if
you<00:03:15.959> drew<00:03:16.470> something<00:03:16.680> and<00:03:16.950> it<00:03:17.010> doesn't<00:03:17.160> look

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
you drew something and it doesn't look

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.610 
you drew something and it doesn't look
quite<00:03:17.580> right<00:03:17.959> so<00:03:18.959> now<00:03:19.050> we<00:03:19.140> want<00:03:19.320> to<00:03:19.410> draw<00:03:19.560> in

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
quite right so now we want to draw in

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.350 
quite right so now we want to draw in
our<00:03:19.650> hydrogen<00:03:19.739> so<00:03:20.280> it's<00:03:20.459> easy<00:03:20.670> to<00:03:20.760> start<00:03:21.150> with

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
our hydrogen so it's easy to start with

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.750 
our hydrogen so it's easy to start with
the<00:03:21.540> axial<00:03:22.230> hydrogen's<00:03:22.500> because<00:03:23.040> those<00:03:23.459> are

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
the axial hydrogen's because those are

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.270 
the axial hydrogen's because those are
straight<00:03:24.390> up<00:03:24.540> or<00:03:24.750> straight<00:03:25.019> down<00:03:25.080> so<00:03:25.920> here<00:03:26.130> we

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
straight up or straight down so here we

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.780 
straight up or straight down so here we
have<00:03:26.400> our<00:03:26.550> three<00:03:27.709> zigzag<00:03:28.709> ups<00:03:28.980> so<00:03:29.640> they're

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
have our three zigzag ups so they're

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.600 
have our three zigzag ups so they're
going<00:03:30.000> to<00:03:30.209> have<00:03:30.360> hydrogen's<00:03:30.900> straight<00:03:31.290> up<00:03:33.050> and

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
going to have hydrogen's straight up and

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.190 
going to have hydrogen's straight up and
then<00:03:35.610> the<00:03:35.730> other<00:03:35.850> three<00:03:36.090> carbons<00:03:36.600> are<00:03:36.750> zigzags

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
then the other three carbons are zigzags

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.900 
then the other three carbons are zigzags
down<00:03:37.500> and<00:03:37.830> those<00:03:38.489> are<00:03:38.640> going<00:03:38.760> to<00:03:38.820> have

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
down and those are going to have

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.650 
down and those are going to have
hydrogen<00:03:39.390> straight<00:03:39.720> down<00:03:39.930> and<00:03:40.850> remember<00:03:41.850> that

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
hydrogen straight down and remember that

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.830 
hydrogen straight down and remember that
this<00:03:42.900> representation<00:03:44.120> by<00:03:45.120> convention<00:03:45.690> has

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
this representation by convention has

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.680 
this representation by convention has
this<00:03:46.080> these<00:03:46.830> carbons<00:03:47.280> on<00:03:47.850> the<00:03:48.000> bottom<00:03:48.390> here

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
this these carbons on the bottom here

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.229 
this these carbons on the bottom here
are<00:03:49.140> the<00:03:49.350> front<00:03:49.680> carbons<00:03:50.160> so<00:03:50.370> this<00:03:50.700> carbon<00:03:51.060> is

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
are the front carbons so this carbon is

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.590 
are the front carbons so this carbon is
behind<00:03:51.810> and<00:03:52.230> so<00:03:52.410> we<00:03:52.530> want<00:03:52.680> to<00:03:52.769> break<00:03:52.980> that<00:03:53.250> line

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
behind and so we want to break that line

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.000 
behind and so we want to break that line
to<00:03:54.600> show<00:03:54.810> that<00:03:54.989> it's<00:03:55.140> behind<00:03:55.560> this

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
to show that it's behind this

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.140 
to show that it's behind this
carbon-carbon<00:03:56.489> bond<00:03:58.760> so<00:03:59.760> those<00:03:59.910> are<00:04:00.030> our

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
carbon-carbon bond so those are our

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.120 
carbon-carbon bond so those are our
axial<00:04:00.780> hydrogen's<00:04:01.170> now<00:04:01.500> we<00:04:01.620> go<00:04:01.769> to<00:04:01.830> draw<00:04:02.070> the

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
axial hydrogen's now we go to draw the

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.490 
axial hydrogen's now we go to draw the
equatorial<00:04:02.820> hydrogen's<00:04:03.120> and<00:04:03.570> we're<00:04:04.350> going<00:04:04.470> to

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
equatorial hydrogen's and we're going to

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.120 
equatorial hydrogen's and we're going to
do<00:04:04.709> so<00:04:06.440> they're<00:04:07.440> going<00:04:07.530> to<00:04:07.590> be<00:04:07.650> pointing

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
do so they're going to be pointing

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.729 
do so they're going to be pointing
slightly<00:04:08.310> up<00:04:08.760> or<00:04:08.970> slightly<00:04:09.360> down<00:04:09.540> and<00:04:09.810> they're

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
slightly up or slightly down and they're

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.850 
slightly up or slightly down and they're
going<00:04:10.920> to<00:04:11.190> be<00:04:12.200> parallel<00:04:13.200> to<00:04:13.320> some<00:04:13.470> other<00:04:13.620> bond

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
going to be parallel to some other bond

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.500 
going to be parallel to some other bond
that's<00:04:14.070> formed<00:04:14.160> so<00:04:14.549> if<00:04:14.640> we<00:04:14.760> start<00:04:15.060> at<00:04:15.450> the

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
that's formed so if we start at the

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.449 
that's formed so if we start at the
carbon<00:04:15.959> on<00:04:16.019> the<00:04:16.080> far<00:04:16.320> right<00:04:16.530> here<00:04:16.830> we<00:04:17.250> have<00:04:17.370> an

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
carbon on the far right here we have an

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.110 
carbon on the far right here we have an
axial<00:04:17.850> that's<00:04:18.030> straight<00:04:18.269> up<00:04:18.299> and<00:04:18.690> if<00:04:19.380> we<00:04:19.500> draw

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
axial that's straight up and if we draw

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
axial that's straight up and if we draw
109.5<00:04:22.250> it<00:04:23.250> will<00:04:23.700> it<00:04:24.510> will<00:04:24.660> look<00:04:24.810> something

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
109.5 it will it will look something

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.490 
109.5 it will it will look something
like

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
like

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.050 
like
and<00:04:25.800> you<00:04:25.890> can<00:04:26.040> see<00:04:26.190> that<00:04:26.340> this<00:04:26.490> bond<00:04:26.790> is

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
and you can see that this bond is

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.790 
and you can see that this bond is
parallel<00:04:28.050> to<00:04:28.620> this<00:04:28.770> bond<00:04:30.320> okay<00:04:31.320> then<00:04:31.530> we<00:04:31.620> come

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
parallel to this bond okay then we come

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.460 
parallel to this bond okay then we come
down<00:04:31.920> here<00:04:32.310> the<00:04:32.880> bond<00:04:33.120> what<00:04:34.020> you<00:04:34.170> want<00:04:34.350> to

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
down here the bond what you want to

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.040 
down here the bond what you want to
avoid<00:04:34.650> is<00:04:35.220> drawing<00:04:35.580> a<00:04:36.000> hydrogen<00:04:36.630> straight

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
avoid is drawing a hydrogen straight

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.860 
avoid is drawing a hydrogen straight
across<00:04:37.260> at<00:04:37.620> a<00:04:37.650> 90<00:04:37.950> degree<00:04:37.980> angle<00:04:38.480> so<00:04:39.480> this<00:04:39.660> one

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
across at a 90 degree angle so this one

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.920 
across at a 90 degree angle so this one
is<00:04:39.990> going<00:04:40.140> to<00:04:40.410> be<00:04:41.210> again<00:04:42.210> a<00:04:42.270> little<00:04:42.390> wider<00:04:42.690> than

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
is going to be again a little wider than

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.180 
is going to be again a little wider than
90<00:04:43.320> so<00:04:44.630> keep<00:04:45.630> in<00:04:45.780> mind<00:04:46.020> that<00:04:46.170> every<00:04:46.440> carbon<00:04:46.920> is

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
90 so keep in mind that every carbon is

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.870 
90 so keep in mind that every carbon is
going<00:04:47.340> to<00:04:47.580> have<00:04:47.760> one<00:04:48.890> hydrogen<00:04:49.890> that's<00:04:50.580> in<00:04:50.790> the

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
going to have one hydrogen that's in the

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.460 
going to have one hydrogen that's in the
up<00:04:51.030> position<00:04:51.240> and<00:04:51.720> one<00:04:51.900> that's<00:04:52.080> in<00:04:52.200> the<00:04:52.230> down

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
up position and one that's in the down

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.710 
up position and one that's in the down
position<00:04:52.610> so<00:04:53.610> if<00:04:53.700> we<00:04:53.820> have<00:04:53.940> an<00:04:54.000> axial<00:04:54.450> that's

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
position so if we have an axial that's

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.840 
position so if we have an axial that's
straight<00:04:55.290> up<00:04:55.440> then<00:04:55.890> the<00:04:56.070> equatorial<00:04:56.670> is<00:04:56.700> going

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
straight up then the equatorial is going

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.850 
straight up then the equatorial is going
to<00:04:56.910> be<00:04:57.000> pointing<00:04:57.330> slightly<00:04:57.720> down<00:04:57.930> if<00:04:58.560> we've<00:04:58.740> an

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
to be pointing slightly down if we've an

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.860 
to be pointing slightly down if we've an
axial<00:04:59.280> straight<00:04:59.490> down<00:04:59.700> the<00:05:00.240> equatorial<00:05:00.630> is

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
axial straight down the equatorial is

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.680 
axial straight down the equatorial is
going<00:05:00.990> to<00:05:01.050> be<00:05:01.140> slightly<00:05:01.410> up<00:05:02.240> so<00:05:03.240> we<00:05:03.360> can<00:05:03.510> come

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
going to be slightly up so we can come

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.450 
going to be slightly up so we can come
to<00:05:03.780> the<00:05:03.900> other<00:05:04.050> end<00:05:04.320> and<00:05:04.530> fill<00:05:04.890> in<00:05:05.010> those<00:05:05.190> two

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
to the other end and fill in those two

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.400 
to the other end and fill in those two
as<00:05:05.580> well<00:05:05.790> this<00:05:06.420> hydrogen<00:05:06.870> is<00:05:07.020> going<00:05:07.230> to<00:05:07.350> be

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
as well this hydrogen is going to be

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.490 
as well this hydrogen is going to be
pointing<00:05:07.710> down<00:05:08.600> and<00:05:09.600> this<00:05:09.750> hydrogen<00:05:09.930> is<00:05:10.230> gonna

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
pointing down and this hydrogen is gonna

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.090 
pointing down and this hydrogen is gonna
be<00:05:10.560> pointing<00:05:10.740> up<00:05:11.090> and<00:05:12.560> then<00:05:13.560> I<00:05:13.710> think<00:05:13.950> these

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
be pointing up and then I think these

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.800 
be pointing up and then I think these
middle<00:05:14.490> two<00:05:14.640> carbons<00:05:15.090> are<00:05:15.240> usually<00:05:15.720> the

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
middle two carbons are usually the

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.690 
middle two carbons are usually the
trickiest<00:05:16.200> those<00:05:16.470> are<00:05:16.590> ones<00:05:16.770> that<00:05:17.040> cause<00:05:17.400> some

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
trickiest those are ones that cause some

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.250 
trickiest those are ones that cause some
problems<00:05:18.120> but<00:05:18.240> if<00:05:18.360> you<00:05:18.480> look<00:05:18.660> for<00:05:18.840> those<00:05:18.930> M's

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
problems but if you look for those M's

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.530 
problems but if you look for those M's
and<00:05:19.590> those<00:05:19.710> w's<00:05:20.190> and<00:05:20.430> keep<00:05:21.000> in<00:05:21.150> mind<00:05:21.390> that<00:05:21.450> it

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
and those w's and keep in mind that it

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:22.970 
and those w's and keep in mind that it
has<00:05:21.660> to<00:05:21.780> be<00:05:21.840> parallel<00:05:22.320> to<00:05:22.350> some<00:05:22.560> other<00:05:22.710> bond

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
has to be parallel to some other bond

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.680 
has to be parallel to some other bond
we're<00:05:23.520> gonna<00:05:23.700> look<00:05:23.790> at<00:05:23.940> this<00:05:24.090> bond<00:05:24.390> are<00:05:24.600> gonna

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
we're gonna look at this bond are gonna

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.780 
we're gonna look at this bond are gonna
be<00:05:24.900> parallel<00:05:25.290> to<00:05:25.440> this<00:05:25.560> bond<00:05:25.830> and<00:05:26.550> once<00:05:26.669> you're

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:26.790 
be parallel to this bond and once you're

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.430 
be parallel to this bond and once you're
gonna<00:05:26.940> draw<00:05:27.120> it<00:05:27.180> right<00:05:27.300> here<00:05:27.980> and<00:05:29.840> then<00:05:30.840> up<00:05:31.169> in

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
gonna draw it right here and then up in

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.590 
gonna draw it right here and then up in
this<00:05:31.590> back<00:05:31.800> carbon<00:05:32.280> we're<00:05:32.910> going<00:05:33.150> to<00:05:33.270> draw<00:05:33.480> it

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
this back carbon we're going to draw it

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.500 
this back carbon we're going to draw it
up<00:05:33.750> in<00:05:34.050> this<00:05:34.770> direction<00:05:35.010> so<00:05:35.580> that<00:05:36.390> it's

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
up in this direction so that it's

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.800 
up in this direction so that it's
parallel<00:05:36.750> to<00:05:37.590> this<00:05:37.710> bond<00:05:38.419> that's<00:05:39.419> already

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
parallel to this bond that's already

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.440 
parallel to this bond that's already
shown<00:05:40.550> so<00:05:41.550> that<00:05:41.669> looks<00:05:41.880> like<00:05:42.030> a<00:05:42.060> pretty<00:05:42.360> good

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450 
shown so that looks like a pretty good

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:47.420 
shown so that looks like a pretty good
chair<00:05:43.100> now<00:05:44.100> another<00:05:44.370> possibility<00:05:44.640> is<00:05:45.500> to<00:05:46.500> not

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
chair now another possibility is to not

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.960 
chair now another possibility is to not
start<00:05:47.880> with<00:05:48.510> a<00:05:48.540> zigzag<00:05:49.280> at<00:05:50.280> the<00:05:50.460> bottom<00:05:50.760> and<00:05:50.880> go

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
start with a zigzag at the bottom and go

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.659 
start with a zigzag at the bottom and go
up<00:05:51.210> well<00:05:51.810> we<00:05:51.960> can<00:05:52.110> start<00:05:52.410> with<00:05:52.710> a<00:05:53.400> triangle

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:53.669 
up well we can start with a triangle

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:58.909 
up well we can start with a triangle
like<00:05:53.880> this<00:05:55.880> and<00:05:56.990> then<00:05:57.990> we're<00:05:58.200> gonna<00:05:58.290> draw<00:05:58.590> two

00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 
like this and then we're gonna draw two

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:02.950 
like this and then we're gonna draw two
parallel<00:05:59.160> bonds<00:05:59.610> going<00:05:59.880> up<00:06:00.150> and<00:06:00.740> then<00:06:01.740> two

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 
parallel bonds going up and then two

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.150 
parallel bonds going up and then two
going<00:06:03.960> down<00:06:04.169> I'm<00:06:04.320> not<00:06:04.470> quite<00:06:04.710> as<00:06:04.830> good<00:06:04.979> at

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160 
going down I'm not quite as good at

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.610 
going down I'm not quite as good at
drawing<00:06:05.940> these<00:06:06.210> chairs<00:06:06.540> in<00:06:06.960> this<00:06:07.410> direction

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 
drawing these chairs in this direction

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.140 
drawing these chairs in this direction
so<00:06:07.919> you<00:06:08.100> can<00:06:08.250> see<00:06:08.490> that<00:06:08.760> when<00:06:08.880> you<00:06:08.970> compare

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
so you can see that when you compare

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.270 
so you can see that when you compare
these<00:06:09.479> two<00:06:09.540> chairs<00:06:09.990> it's<00:06:10.650> like<00:06:10.890> you<00:06:11.070> have<00:06:11.250> a

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 
these two chairs it's like you have a

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.280 
these two chairs it's like you have a
mirror<00:06:11.820> image<00:06:12.030> between<00:06:12.360> the<00:06:12.690> two<00:06:12.870> they<00:06:13.110> have<00:06:13.260> a

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:13.290 
mirror image between the two they have a

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.830 
mirror image between the two they have a
different<00:06:13.740> starting<00:06:14.490> shape<00:06:14.790> and<00:06:15.030> so<00:06:15.690> that

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 
different starting shape and so that

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.320 
different starting shape and so that
chair<00:06:16.140> is<00:06:16.290> just<00:06:16.560> as<00:06:16.680> good<00:06:16.860> to<00:06:17.010> draw<00:06:17.250> but<00:06:18.060> again

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330 
chair is just as good to draw but again

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:19.940 
chair is just as good to draw but again
well<00:06:18.660> if<00:06:18.960> we<00:06:19.140> wanted<00:06:19.410> to<00:06:19.470> fill<00:06:19.740> in<00:06:19.860> the

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:19.950 
well if we wanted to fill in the

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:23.030 
well if we wanted to fill in the
hydrogen's<00:06:20.430> we'll<00:06:21.000> draw<00:06:21.300> our<00:06:21.510> six<00:06:22.040> axial

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:23.040 
hydrogen's we'll draw our six axial

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:27.409 
hydrogen's we'll draw our six axial
hydrogen's<00:06:23.720> three<00:06:24.720> straight<00:06:25.050> up<00:06:25.200> and<00:06:26.419> three

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:27.419 
hydrogen's three straight up and three

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:30.170 
hydrogen's three straight up and three
straight<00:06:27.720> down<00:06:28.310> it's<00:06:29.310> this<00:06:29.520> back<00:06:29.790> carbon

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:30.180 
straight down it's this back carbon

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.970 
straight down it's this back carbon
that's<00:06:30.510> going<00:06:30.780> to<00:06:30.870> be<00:06:30.990> a<00:06:31.020> broken<00:06:31.440> bond

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:34.980 

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:38.180 

and<00:06:35.070> then<00:06:35.370> filling<00:06:35.790> in<00:06:35.940> our<00:06:36.060> equatorial<00:06:37.190> we

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:38.190 
and then filling in our equatorial we

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:41.090 
and then filling in our equatorial we
can<00:06:38.400> start<00:06:38.850> on<00:06:39.030> the<00:06:39.150> right<00:06:39.330> end<00:06:39.740> go<00:06:40.740> slightly

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:41.100 
can start on the right end go slightly

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.480 
can start on the right end go slightly
up<00:06:41.690> for<00:06:42.690> this<00:06:42.840> one<00:06:43.050> and<00:06:43.230> slightly<00:06:43.530> down<00:06:43.800> the

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:44.490 
up for this one and slightly down the

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:47.740 
up for this one and slightly down the
next<00:06:44.760> one<00:06:44.940> and<00:06:45.740> then<00:06:46.740> jump<00:06:47.040> to<00:06:47.100> the<00:06:47.220> other<00:06:47.280> side

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:47.750 
next one and then jump to the other side

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.110 
next one and then jump to the other side
slightly<00:06:48.750> down<00:06:48.960> and<00:06:49.430> slightly<00:06:50.430> up<00:06:50.730> so<00:06:50.910> you<00:06:51.000> can

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 
slightly down and slightly up so you can

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.630 
slightly down and slightly up so you can
see<00:06:51.270> these<00:06:51.390> equatorial<00:06:51.930> hydrogen's<00:06:52.410> on<00:06:52.830> the

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:53.640 
see these equatorial hydrogen's on the

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.430 
see these equatorial hydrogen's on the
ends<00:06:54.120> here<00:06:54.240> kind<00:06:54.570> of<00:06:54.630> pointed<00:06:55.050> toward<00:06:55.320> each

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 
ends here kind of pointed toward each

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.560 
ends here kind of pointed toward each
other<00:06:55.610> they're<00:06:56.610> kind<00:06:56.850> of<00:06:56.910> pointing<00:06:57.240> in<00:06:57.330> toward

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:57.570 
other they're kind of pointing in toward

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:59.030 
other they're kind of pointing in toward
each<00:06:57.660> other<00:06:57.900> that<00:06:58.170> is<00:06:58.380> something<00:06:58.740> else<00:06:58.920> you

00:06:59.030 --> 00:06:59.040 
each other that is something else you

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.270 
each other that is something else you
can<00:06:59.190> maybe<00:06:59.850> be<00:07:00.540> on<00:07:00.570> the<00:07:00.750> lookout<00:07:01.020> for<00:07:01.320> and<00:07:01.590> then

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:02.280 
can maybe be on the lookout for and then

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.970 
can maybe be on the lookout for and then
those<00:07:02.460> inside<00:07:02.940> ones<00:07:03.560> and<00:07:04.560> we<00:07:04.620> want<00:07:04.770> to<00:07:04.830> make<00:07:04.950> a

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:04.980 
those inside ones and we want to make a

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:08.810 
those inside ones and we want to make a
parallel<00:07:05.700> to<00:07:05.910> an<00:07:06.000> existing<00:07:06.540> bond<00:07:07.640> so<00:07:08.640> this

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:08.820 
parallel to an existing bond so this

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:11.270 
parallel to an existing bond so this
bond<00:07:09.090> is<00:07:09.360> parallel<00:07:09.780> to<00:07:09.930> this<00:07:10.080> bond<00:07:10.380> when<00:07:11.190> we

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280 
bond is parallel to this bond when we

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.030 
bond is parallel to this bond when we
see<00:07:11.460> that<00:07:11.610> M<00:07:11.820> shape<00:07:12.150> and<00:07:12.390> up<00:07:13.200> here<00:07:13.560> we're<00:07:13.950> gonna

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:14.040 
see that M shape and up here we're gonna

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.790 
see that M shape and up here we're gonna
make<00:07:14.130> a<00:07:14.310> W<00:07:14.730> let<00:07:15.360> me<00:07:15.420> draw<00:07:15.630> this<00:07:15.810> bond<00:07:16.080> parallel

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800 
make a W let me draw this bond parallel

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.860 
make a W let me draw this bond parallel
to<00:07:16.950> this<00:07:17.100> bond<00:07:17.930> and<00:07:19.160> we<00:07:20.160> have<00:07:20.340> that<00:07:20.600> W<00:07:21.600> shape

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:21.870 
to this bond and we have that W shape

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:23.840 
to this bond and we have that W shape
going<00:07:22.080> on<00:07:22.320> so<00:07:23.100> there's<00:07:23.250> a<00:07:23.310> few<00:07:23.460> different<00:07:23.730> ways

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:23.850 
going on so there's a few different ways

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:25.640 
going on so there's a few different ways
that<00:07:24.000> we<00:07:24.150> can<00:07:24.300> draw<00:07:24.540> some<00:07:24.810> chair

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:25.650 
that we can draw some chair

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:27.980 
that we can draw some chair
confirmations<00:07:26.400> and<00:07:26.520> the<00:07:27.030> key<00:07:27.240> is<00:07:27.390> to<00:07:27.570> just<00:07:27.600> get

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:27.990 
confirmations and the key is to just get

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:31.870 
confirmations and the key is to just get
some<00:07:28.140> practice<00:07:28.590> so<00:07:29.310> that<00:07:29.570> when<00:07:30.570> we<00:07:30.780> go<00:07:31.050> to<00:07:31.110> draw

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:31.880 
some practice so that when we go to draw

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.250 
some practice so that when we go to draw
substituted<00:07:32.880> cyclohexane<00:07:33.630> chairs<00:07:33.930> in<00:07:34.140> other

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:34.260 
substituted cyclohexane chairs in other

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.380 
substituted cyclohexane chairs in other
words<00:07:34.440> once<00:07:34.680> we<00:07:34.770> put<00:07:34.950> a<00:07:35.150> one<00:07:36.150> or<00:07:36.270> more

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:36.390 
words once we put a one or more

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:40.100 
words once we put a one or more
substituent<00:07:37.140> on<00:07:37.230> the<00:07:37.560> ring<00:07:37.910> we<00:07:38.910> can<00:07:39.150> place<00:07:39.870> it

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:40.110 
substituent on the ring we can place it

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:42.230 
substituent on the ring we can place it
very<00:07:40.650> nicely<00:07:40.860> in<00:07:41.220> the<00:07:41.310> appropriate<00:07:41.790> position

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.240 
very nicely in the appropriate position

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.900 
very nicely in the appropriate position
on<00:07:42.510> each<00:07:43.170> carbon<00:07:43.470> maybe<00:07:44.160> it's<00:07:44.340> in<00:07:44.430> the<00:07:44.520> axial

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:44.910 
on each carbon maybe it's in the axial

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:46.130 
on each carbon maybe it's in the axial
position<00:07:44.940> maybe<00:07:45.480> it's<00:07:45.630> in<00:07:45.690> the<00:07:45.780> equatorial

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:46.140 
position maybe it's in the equatorial

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:47.930 
position maybe it's in the equatorial
position<00:07:46.440> but<00:07:47.250> knowing<00:07:47.670> where<00:07:47.820> those

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:47.940 
position but knowing where those

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:51.100 
position but knowing where those
positions<00:07:48.270> are<00:07:48.600> and<00:07:48.660> what<00:07:48.930> their<00:07:49.100> relative

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:51.110 
positions are and what their relative

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:53.300 
positions are and what their relative
stereochemistry<00:07:52.110> is<00:07:52.740> what<00:07:52.920> the<00:07:53.040> relative

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:53.310 
stereochemistry is what the relative

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:55.340 
stereochemistry is what the relative
shapes<00:07:53.700> our<00:07:53.910> own<00:07:54.030> placements<00:07:54.540> are<00:07:54.660> then<00:07:55.230> we

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:55.350 
shapes our own placements are then we

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:56.780 
shapes our own placements are then we
can<00:07:55.530> draw<00:07:55.710> a<00:07:55.740> very<00:07:55.920> nice<00:07:56.160> chairs<00:07:56.460> moving

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:56.790 
can draw a very nice chairs moving

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:59.180 
can draw a very nice chairs moving
forward
