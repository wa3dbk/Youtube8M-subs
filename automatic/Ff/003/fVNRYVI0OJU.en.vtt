00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.850
 Hi girls, how are you? I 'm not going today. 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.230
 appear in the video that will appear are 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.179
 my actions 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.910
 I came to bring this tutorial here from 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.870
 sapphire zones and I hope you 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.480
 like 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.060
 she is not very difficult to do that 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.400
 I do not have much practice with drawings. 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.810
 in the streets I got you with 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.519
 sure will do 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.650
 so if you want to know how I did it? 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.789
 this nail just keep watching the 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.609
 video 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.949
 then they to do this we will hi 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:37.950
 need the glaze you want 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:43.410
 put on the bottom of the green enamel of a 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:45.090
 white of the base of any brush 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:51.239
 thing you can use this tip 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:53.940
 to make the balls and the little apple of the 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.340
 cotton enamel remover and pay 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.520
 Everything to make an advance I already did 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:03.510
 these three days here so let's go 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:07.890
 the other thing we need already 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.659
 also needs round sticker this 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.390
 here is an agenda that I've picked up 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.900
 if you have that to put envelope 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.540
 It also helps to advance. I already did this. 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:26.220
 It's these two lines here I've already 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:29.460
 base I've already spent the base I'm going 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.970
 I'll put the sticker here more or 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.130
 less than half the sticker 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.530
 here on the nail another half can leave 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.829
 it out that it's easier to do 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.649
 this round part of the head of the acts 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:48.030
 I'll get the nail polish I want to use 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:50.340
 this background here is Audrey and impala 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.799
 I'm going to pass this one, I've spent only one 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.390
 call I thought it covered well then 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.390
 I'll go over here on that nail 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:08.240
 I already passed and already passed 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:11.680
 the toothpick right after that I think 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:21.530
 makes it easy to clean the nooks and crannies 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:25.840
 I already had the excess and here is not that the 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.840
 colleague if the sticker the same thing 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.190
 if you will use enamel that dries 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:39.920
 very fast then you will have to be 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.750
 very fast at that moment because this 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.159
 here has to be taken before 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.159
 that the enamel century 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:52.489
 here was that this part here where I 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.190
 I did not want you to stay so I'm going to 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:03:06.739
 here the little bit just to get this 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:10.629
 access that was left here now 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:20.450
 the blue whiting I am using is the 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:22.750
 214 of the networks and palace and only in this tour 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.750
 on here 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.310
 ready 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:50.769
 I'll take some of the enamel from the 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:52.870
 rit I already put it here in the pot where you 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.790
 can put on paper 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.569
 I like to put it here, it's okay. 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:04.269
 easy to remove the lid of the dande and guard 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:09.430
 In mine on the cotton I make for 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:14.950
 brush and put it here where I 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:16.900
 I want it to be the eye across the 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:21.269
 same thing but if you stay a little bit 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.269
 Different, you gotta fix the money. 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:31.919
 enjoy and I'll do the tips 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.919
 in that other nail 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:46.620
 Okay, so that's it. I'll clean it right here. 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:49.370
 Now I'm going to get the white glaze and I'm going 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.370
 do the same thing 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.870
 I'll put it here a little bit 

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:10.740
 again with the tip of the ac 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:14.300
 where I had already marked the first time 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.300
 the first ball invitation 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:25.289
 op and now with this one that was what 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.740
 I used it as a base but you could be 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:32.339
 using black enamel or fabric paint 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:34.169
 It's also because I do not have these here. 

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:37.369
 Do not have black enamel or 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:43.139
 then use this enamel that even 

00:05:37.369 --> 00:05:46.399
 Now you get the toothpick, I make a little eye. 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:46.399
 inside the white ball 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:06.930
 it really scratches our nose 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:09.540
 and now I'll do a little bit I do 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:11.910
 with the stick itself 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:13.889
 but if you have to dispense them 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:17.120
 help a lot 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:17.120
 a workout at ok 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.310
 and our fingernail is ready now 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.760
 I'm just going to clean here, I'm going to show it back. 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:35.090
 For you, how'd you girls get the nail? 

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:39.350
 so you saw was pretty simple to 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:41.630
 doing one is very difficult and I hope 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:44.570
 You liked it if you liked it. 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.370
