so now we're finished with the overall

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.970 
so now we're finished with the overall
baseline<00:00:08.580> sides<00:00:09.059> and<00:00:09.330> back<00:00:09.480> are<00:00:09.690> done<00:00:09.900> and<00:00:10.139> now

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
baseline sides and back are done and now

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.110 
baseline sides and back are done and now
we're<00:00:11.099> going<00:00:11.190> to<00:00:11.250> go<00:00:11.400> back<00:00:11.580> to<00:00:11.730> this<00:00:11.849> back

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
we're going to go back to this back

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.030 
we're going to go back to this back
section<00:00:12.450> where<00:00:12.900> we<00:00:13.049> had<00:00:13.170> taken<00:00:13.410> from<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:13.860> back

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
section where we had taken from the back

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.490 
section where we had taken from the back
of<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.340> ear<00:00:14.519> up<00:00:15.330> around<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.870> crown<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.350> back

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
of the ear up around the crown and back

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.380 
of the ear up around the crown and back
down<00:00:16.800> and<00:00:17.100> what<00:00:17.279> we<00:00:17.400> want<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.670> try<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:18.029> do<00:00:18.180> now

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
down and what we want to try and do now

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.189 
down and what we want to try and do now
is<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.529> introduce<00:00:19.800> some<00:00:20.220> layers<00:00:20.960> layers<00:00:21.960> that

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
is to introduce some layers layers that

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.800 
is to introduce some layers layers that
are<00:00:22.320> gonna<00:00:22.470> be<00:00:22.680> sort<00:00:22.890> of<00:00:22.980> soft<00:00:23.660> lots<00:00:24.660> of

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
are gonna be sort of soft lots of

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.189 
are gonna be sort of soft lots of
movement<00:00:25.230> lots<00:00:25.439> of<00:00:25.529> flow<00:00:25.769> not<00:00:26.189> too<00:00:26.369> short<00:00:27.199> we

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
movement lots of flow not too short we

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.839 
movement lots of flow not too short we
always<00:00:28.500> have<00:00:28.680> reference<00:00:29.189> points<00:00:29.609> when<00:00:29.760> it

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
always have reference points when it

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.519 
always have reference points when it
comes<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.240> Sebastian<00:00:30.779> haircuts<00:00:31.199> we<00:00:31.349> don't

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
comes to Sebastian haircuts we don't

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.549 
comes to Sebastian haircuts we don't
necessarily<00:00:31.740> have<00:00:32.540> particular<00:00:33.540> sections<00:00:34.290> but

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
necessarily have particular sections but

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.110 
necessarily have particular sections but
we<00:00:34.680> have<00:00:34.829> our<00:00:35.010> reference<00:00:35.219> points<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:35.910> whether

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
we have our reference points so whether

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.940 
we have our reference points so whether
that's<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.510> chin<00:00:36.780> or<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.050> top<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.590> lip<00:00:37.770> or

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
that's the chin or the top of the lip or

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.729 
that's the chin or the top of the lip or
the<00:00:38.070> tip<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.460> nose<00:00:38.640> or<00:00:39.410> sometimes<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.590> can

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
the tip of the nose or sometimes it can

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.240 
the tip of the nose or sometimes it can
be<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.730> bottom<00:00:42.120> base<00:00:42.540> line<00:00:42.899> so<00:00:43.680> in<00:00:44.010> this

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
be the the bottom base line so in this

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.250 
be the the bottom base line so in this
case<00:00:44.789> when<00:00:45.120> we<00:00:45.149> started<00:00:45.600> at<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.750> back<00:00:45.960> if<00:00:46.200> I

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
case when we started at the back if I

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.630 
case when we started at the back if I
just<00:00:46.440> keep<00:00:46.649> starting<00:00:46.950> Paul<00:00:47.250> look<00:00:47.489> what

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
just keep starting Paul look what

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.720 
just keep starting Paul look what
happens<00:00:48.620> but<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.100> base<00:00:50.250> line<00:00:50.399> that's

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
happens but this is the base line that's

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.270 
happens but this is the base line that's
just<00:00:50.820> being<00:00:51.149> called<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:52.170> this<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:52.739> our<00:00:53.039> guide

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
just being called so this is our guide

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.600 
just being called so this is our guide
so<00:00:54.030> if<00:00:54.180> we<00:00:54.329> pull<00:00:54.539> out<00:00:54.570> at<00:00:54.840> 90<00:00:55.379> this<00:00:56.160> hair<00:00:56.460> will

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
so if we pull out at 90 this hair will

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.240 
so if we pull out at 90 this hair will
start<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.000> fall<00:00:57.320> so<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.469> only<00:00:58.680> thing<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.129> we

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
start to fall so the only thing that we

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.279 
start to fall so the only thing that we
really<00:00:59.280> have<00:00:59.910> to<00:00:59.940> find<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.510> how<00:01:00.840> much<00:01:01.050> hair

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
really have to find is how much hair

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.080 
really have to find is how much hair
that<00:01:01.320> we<00:01:01.590> want<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.890> take<00:01:02.100> off<00:01:02.370> from<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.879> top

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
that we want to take off from the top

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.630 
that we want to take off from the top
section<00:01:03.600> because<00:01:04.199> we're<00:01:04.379> gonna<00:01:04.530> go<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.400> cut

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
section because we're gonna go and cut

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.200 
section because we're gonna go and cut
from<00:01:05.790> shorter<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.990> longer<00:01:07.220> so<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.610> little<00:01:08.970> tip

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
from shorter to longer so a little tip

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.679 
from shorter to longer so a little tip
would<00:01:09.390> be<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.510> take<00:01:09.950> the<00:01:10.950> top<00:01:11.220> section<00:01:11.689> and

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
would be to take the top section and

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.200 
would be to take the top section and
place<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.380> down<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:14.010> see<00:01:14.640> where<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:14.970> are<00:01:15.000> in

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
place that down and see where you are in

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.460 
place that down and see where you are in
comparison<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.140> length

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
comparison to the length

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.950 
comparison to the length
now<00:01:17.220> we'll<00:01:17.520> kwitny<00:01:17.729> share<00:01:18.119> what<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.540> would<00:01:18.780> like

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
now we'll kwitny share what I would like

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.530 
now we'll kwitny share what I would like
to<00:01:19.110> do<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.470> go<00:01:19.740> below<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.430> occipital<00:01:20.790> bone<00:01:21.030> so

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
to do is go below the occipital bone so

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.020 
to do is go below the occipital bone so
anything<00:01:22.110> under<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.830> below<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.759> occipital

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
anything under and below the occipital

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.850 
anything under and below the occipital
bone<00:01:24.270> will<00:01:24.570> give<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:24.960> nice<00:01:25.259> fitted

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
bone will give you that nice fitted

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.200 
bone will give you that nice fitted
shape<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.400> really<00:01:26.610> that's<00:01:26.790> what<00:01:26.939> it's<00:01:27.060> all

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
shape and really that's what it's all

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.649 
shape and really that's what it's all
about

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
about

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.039 
about
we're<00:01:27.960> trying<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.259> fit<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:29.119> curve<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.750> hair

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
we're trying to fit and curve the hair

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.740 
we're trying to fit and curve the hair
to<00:01:31.590> match<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.979> head<00:01:32.159> shape<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:33.270> if<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.540> just

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
to match the head shape so if I just

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.350 
to match the head shape so if I just
take<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.049> out<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.650> drop<00:01:35.579> down<00:01:35.790> underneath<00:01:36.240> the

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
take it out and drop down underneath the

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.569 
take it out and drop down underneath the
occipital<00:01:36.720> bone<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.590> will<00:01:37.799> give<00:01:38.009> me<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.220> guide

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
occipital bone that will give me a guide

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.330 
occipital bone that will give me a guide
on<00:01:39.000> how<00:01:39.150> much<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.840> want<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:40.110> take<00:01:40.320> off<00:01:41.570> now<00:01:42.570> I

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
on how much I want to take off now I

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.580 
on how much I want to take off now I
have<00:01:44.340> my<00:01:45.090> baseline<00:01:45.509> length<00:01:45.960> which<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.350> right

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
have my baseline length which is right

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.609 
have my baseline length which is right
there<00:01:46.860> as<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.399> can<00:01:47.549> see<00:01:48.079> now<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.110> can<00:01:49.439> really

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
there as you can see now I can really

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.179 
there as you can see now I can really
see<00:01:49.950> where<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:51.049> have<00:01:52.049> my<00:01:52.470> length<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:52.950> want

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
see where I have my length that I want

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.889 
see where I have my length that I want
to<00:01:53.310> reduce<00:01:53.579> so<00:01:54.149> really<00:01:54.390> what<00:01:54.509> do<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.659> want<00:01:54.810> to

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
to reduce so really what do I want to

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.510 
to reduce so really what do I want to
take<00:01:55.049> off<00:01:55.259> I<00:01:55.470> we<00:01:55.590> just<00:01:55.770> want<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:55.979> take<00:01:56.159> off<00:01:56.369> this

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
take off I we just want to take off this

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.090 
take off I we just want to take off this
corner<00:01:56.969> working<00:01:57.180> from<00:01:57.500> shorter<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:59.070> longer

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
corner working from shorter to longer

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.990 
corner working from shorter to longer
and<00:01:59.670> just<00:02:00.659> by<00:02:00.840> laying<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.530> blade<00:02:01.740> flat<00:02:02.189> you

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
and just by laying the blade flat you

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.580 
and just by laying the blade flat you
then<00:02:03.180> put<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:03.540> little<00:02:03.750> bit<00:02:03.960> of<00:02:03.990> pressure<00:02:04.259> on

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
then put that little bit of pressure on

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.570 
then put that little bit of pressure on
and<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.520> lay<00:02:05.759> it<00:02:05.909> down<00:02:06.890> and<00:02:07.890> you<00:02:08.069> keep<00:02:08.310> laying

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
and you lay it down and you keep laying

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.969 
and you lay it down and you keep laying
it<00:02:08.759> down<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.030> you<00:02:09.810> have<00:02:09.989> that<00:02:10.140> really<00:02:10.500> nice

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
it down and you have that really nice

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.800 
it down and you have that really nice
flow<00:02:11.480> but<00:02:12.480> this<00:02:12.599> is<00:02:12.750> curved<00:02:13.080> skimming

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
flow but this is curved skimming

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.960 
flow but this is curved skimming
you're<00:02:13.959> doing<00:02:14.170> is<00:02:14.290> going<00:02:14.500> from<00:02:14.650> shorter<00:02:15.250> to

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
you're doing is going from shorter to

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:28.710 
you're doing is going from shorter to
longer<00:02:26.730> so<00:02:27.730> with<00:02:27.940> that<00:02:28.120> just<00:02:28.390> follow

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
longer so with that just follow

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.510 
longer so with that just follow
everything<00:02:29.110> and<00:02:29.440> just<00:02:29.470> bring<00:02:30.010> everything<00:02:30.310> out

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
everything and just bring everything out

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.770 
everything and just bring everything out
to<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:30.790> middle<00:02:30.970> of<00:02:31.060> your<00:02:31.209> chest<00:02:31.239> and

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.619 
so the back section is now layered and
now<00:03:11.280> we're<00:03:11.459> really<00:03:11.580> going<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:11.879> go<00:03:12.030> in<00:03:12.209> through

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
now we're really going to go in through

to the sides with this type of shape we

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.630 
to the sides with this type of shape we

still want to keep quite a lot of volume
down<00:03:17.879> here<00:03:18.319> so<00:03:19.319> what<00:03:20.069> we<00:03:20.220> need<00:03:20.400> to<00:03:20.519> do<00:03:20.640> is<00:03:20.870> one

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
down here so what we need to do is one

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.720 
down here so what we need to do is one
way<00:03:22.050> is<00:03:22.230> to<00:03:22.500> over<00:03:22.800> direct<00:03:22.920> but<00:03:23.340> we<00:03:23.430> don't<00:03:23.610> want

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
gently move it out that little bit

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:54.880 
gently move it out that little bit
longer<00:03:48.930> to<00:03:49.680> those<00:03:49.860> ends

little bit more and we spoke earlier on
about<00:04:38.180> reference<00:04:38.840> points<00:04:39.260> so<00:04:39.950> the<00:04:40.070> reference

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
about reference points so the reference

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
points that we have here is just the

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.920 
points that we have here is just the
jawline<00:04:43.640> and<00:04:44.260> using<00:04:45.260> the<00:04:45.440> blade<00:04:45.680> to<00:04:46.810> almost<00:04:47.810> be

the<00:04:48.050> ruler<00:04:48.350> to<00:04:48.650> give<00:04:49.310> you<00:04:49.460> that<00:04:49.640> guy<00:04:49.910> to<00:04:49.970> go

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 
the ruler to give you that guy to go

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.950 
the ruler to give you that guy to go

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
from shorter to longer so our base

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
length is here and what we want to do is

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.080 
length is here and what we want to do is
just<00:04:56.570> slightly<00:04:57.070> soften<00:04:58.070> at<00:04:58.190> this<00:04:58.430> area<00:04:58.670> here

I'm<00:06:26.909> just<00:06:27.120> going<00:06:27.300> to<00:06:27.419> keep<00:06:27.710> these<00:06:29.120> sides<00:06:30.139> away

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:31.139 
I'm just going to keep these sides away

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:37.879 
I'm just going to keep these sides away
from<00:06:31.349> what<00:06:31.740> I'm<00:06:31.860> doing<00:06:35.659> so<00:06:36.659> starting<00:06:37.199> in<00:06:37.379> the

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:37.889 
from what I'm doing so starting in the

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:42.320 
from what I'm doing so starting in the
middle<00:06:39.319> so<00:06:40.319> the<00:06:40.439> same<00:06:40.680> thing<00:06:40.979> nice<00:06:41.520> skimming

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:42.330

so<00:06:48.560> the<00:06:48.740> skim<00:06:49.040> itself<00:06:49.960> is<00:06:50.960> not<00:06:51.200> a<00:06:51.260> very<00:06:51.380> short

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.010 
so the skim itself is not a very short

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:53.980 
so the skim itself is not a very short
or<00:06:52.370> a<00:06:52.400> hard<00:06:52.760> skin<00:06:53.120> we<00:06:53.270> still<00:06:53.540> want<00:06:53.750> to<00:06:53.810> keep

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:57.740 
this line really really soft so what

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.200 
this line really really soft so what
we're<00:06:57.860> going<00:06:58.010> to<00:06:58.070> do<00:06:58.220> is<00:06:58.400> we're<00:06:58.639> going<00:06:58.790> to<00:06:58.850> take

00:06:59.200 --> 00:06:59.210 
we're going to do is we're going to take

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.900 
we're going to do is we're going to take
our<00:06:59.510> blade<00:06:59.900> and<00:07:00.830> just<00:07:01.070> start<00:07:01.340> to<00:07:01.460> blend<00:07:01.730> that

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:01.910 
our blade and just start to blend that

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:12.370 
our blade and just start to blend that
in<00:07:06.760> what<00:07:07.760> we<00:07:07.880> did<00:07:08.030> at<00:07:08.150> the<00:07:08.180> side<00:07:11.230> so<00:07:12.230> it's

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:12.380 
in what we did at the side so it's

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:17.040 
in what we did at the side so it's
almost<00:07:12.560> like<00:07:12.950> making<00:07:13.250> an<00:07:13.610> acute<00:07:14.830> oval<00:07:15.830> shape
