00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
but I don't think it's going to be

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.979 
but I don't think it's going to be
passing<00:03:21.500> an<00:03:21.739> emissions<00:03:22.130> test<00:03:22.340> this<00:03:22.549> summer<00:03:22.989> as

I'm<00:03:24.260> hurt<00:03:24.650> there's<00:03:24.920> actually<00:03:25.220> in<00:03:25.280> about<00:03:25.370> one

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
I'm hurt there's actually in about one

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.199 
I'm hurt there's actually in about one
month<00:03:25.790> time<00:03:26.090> so<00:03:27.070> that's<00:03:28.070> the<00:03:28.190> reason<00:03:28.519> that<00:03:28.549> I

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
month time so that's the reason that I

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.280 
month time so that's the reason that I
think<00:03:29.600> this<00:03:29.900> car<00:03:30.140> was<00:03:30.350> a<00:03:30.380> good<00:03:30.769> candidate<00:03:31.280> for

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
think this car was a good candidate for

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.759 
think this car was a good candidate for
last<00:03:33.290> car<00:03:33.560> standing<00:03:34.070> and<00:03:34.360> of<00:03:35.360> course<00:03:35.600> will<00:03:36.560> end

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
last car standing and of course will end

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.420 
last car standing and of course will end
up<00:03:36.860> ending<00:03:37.190> its<00:03:37.340> life<00:03:37.549> a<00:03:38.380> demolition<00:03:39.380> derby

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430
