 they promised in addition lamented 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.920
 an experience that highlights the possibilities offered by this art for 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.199
 the mentally ill bessÃ³n people that this 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.989
 uu in a recovery process percent and a psychosis or a disorder 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:31.189
 of personality 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.100
 3 the reason why they are among those who work in our services this is 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.080
 a psychic disorder 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.980
 but it is true that 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.750
 mental illness is often linked some asthmatic problems to 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.620
 the palmesanos the defense a lot of attention 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.140
 cardiovascular problems 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.990
 This decision with dancing can improve not only your physical problems 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.390
 but also the self-esteem that we want to see is how to use the 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.030
 flamenco to have better physical well-being and better emotional well-being 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.690
 both the subject of self-esteem 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.409
 i the other aspect 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.180
 the project is 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.380
 from one side 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.250
 these young people belonging to the mental health unit of the Virgin of the 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.990
 Dew 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.590
 They try to overcome isolation through emotions. Go back and learn. 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.930
 a lot because 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.020
 I see that 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.310
 in which effectively the work effe of common flamenco 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.290
 with this it is perfectly possible in you 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.900
 not the approach is part or much less do I need to do at that time 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.220
 of the protagonist 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.720
 and we do not know the palm so what we have to do is accompany not 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.270
 since I keep in mind that I know what I know I have a great time 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.520
 That's why I come, I do not try, I do not miss any day 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.510
 we go very well organized better 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.540
 but it appears it amuses me I spend it pump the real reasons in a workshop 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.820
 affines declined she is happy but affirmed did not transform will not the 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.170
 wolf teachers but over time we were learning enough valued 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.349
 positively 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.770
 that's the key so these people can 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.450
 integrate in society and with flamenco can achieve it
