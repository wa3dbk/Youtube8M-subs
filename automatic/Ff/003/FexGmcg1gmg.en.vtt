00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
what's good guys I'm John the chief and

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.150 
what's good guys I'm John the chief and
for<00:00:03.389> today's<00:00:03.659> video<00:00:03.870> it's<00:00:04.110> on<00:00:04.230> how<00:00:04.470> the<00:00:04.529> rounds

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
for today's video it's on how the rounds

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.490 
for today's video it's on how the rounds
work<00:00:05.370> and<00:00:05.580> the<00:00:06.060> flips<00:00:06.450> work<00:00:06.720> in<00:00:06.899> EXO<00:00:07.319> survival

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
work and the flips work in EXO survival

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.040 
work and the flips work in EXO survival
so<00:00:08.250> if<00:00:08.340> you<00:00:08.429> guys<00:00:08.580> don't<00:00:08.940> know<00:00:09.240> when<00:00:09.599> you<00:00:09.750> beat

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
so if you guys don't know when you beat

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.320 
so if you guys don't know when you beat
round<00:00:10.380> 25<00:00:10.860> it<00:00:11.219> would<00:00:11.429> be<00:00:11.580> it<00:00:11.969> will<00:00:12.090> say<00:00:12.300> that

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
round 25 it would be it will say that

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.749 
round 25 it would be it will say that
you<00:00:12.540> have<00:00:12.900> flipped<00:00:13.290> and<00:00:13.500> what<00:00:14.160> that<00:00:14.309> means<00:00:14.490> is

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
you have flipped and what that means is

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.000 
you have flipped and what that means is
that<00:00:14.820> instead<00:00:15.269> of<00:00:15.599> going<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:16.020> round<00:00:16.230> 26<00:00:16.770> it

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
that instead of going to round 26 it

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.040 
that instead of going to round 26 it
says<00:00:17.070> you're<00:00:17.970> going<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.119> be<00:00:18.270> all<00:00:18.300> round<00:00:18.690> 1

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
says you're going to be all round 1

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.730 
says you're going to be all round 1
subscript<00:00:19.650> 2<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.720> basically<00:00:21.720> that<00:00:22.109> is<00:00:22.140> round

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
subscript 2 and basically that is round

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.060 
subscript 2 and basically that is round
26<00:00:23.279> but<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.970> way<00:00:24.119> it<00:00:24.240> works<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.720> that<00:00:24.750> those<00:00:25.529> 25

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
26 but the way it works is that those 25

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.339 
26 but the way it works is that those 25
rounds<00:00:26.340> are<00:00:26.730> basically<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.300> baseline<00:00:27.990> for

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
rounds are basically the baseline for

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.550 
rounds are basically the baseline for
all<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.980> next<00:00:29.250> rounds<00:00:29.609> so<00:00:30.119> those<00:00:30.779> 25<00:00:31.289> rounds

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
all the next rounds so those 25 rounds

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.620 
all the next rounds so those 25 rounds
they'll<00:00:32.130> be<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.460> exact<00:00:32.910> same<00:00:33.000> thing<00:00:33.450> as

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
they'll be the exact same thing as

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.040 
they'll be the exact same thing as
rounds<00:00:34.170> 26<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:35.010> 50<00:00:35.360> the<00:00:36.360> only<00:00:36.600> difference<00:00:36.960> is

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
rounds 26 to 50 the only difference is

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.100 
rounds 26 to 50 the only difference is
that<00:00:37.190> rounds<00:00:38.190> 26<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.879> 50<00:00:39.030> they'll<00:00:39.780> have<00:00:39.989> the

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
that rounds 26 to 50 they'll have the

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.900 
that rounds 26 to 50 they'll have the
same<00:00:40.350> exact<00:00:40.770> enemies<00:00:41.219> but<00:00:41.489> there'll<00:00:41.730> be<00:00:41.760> a

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
same exact enemies but there'll be a

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.240 
same exact enemies but there'll be a
little<00:00:42.239> bit<00:00:42.390> tougher<00:00:42.930> they'll<00:00:43.469> have<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.770> little

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
little bit tougher they'll have a little

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.529 
little bit tougher they'll have a little
bit<00:00:44.340> more<00:00:44.489> health<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.000> they'll<00:00:45.180> do<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.450> little

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
bit more health and they'll do a little

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.330 
bit more health and they'll do a little
bit<00:00:45.899> more<00:00:46.050> damage<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:47.010> is<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.309> only

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
bit more damage that is the only

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.340 
bit more damage that is the only
difference<00:00:47.730> you<00:00:48.210> get<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.480> same<00:00:48.719> amount<00:00:48.750> of

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
difference you get the same amount of

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.740 
difference you get the same amount of
enemies<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.430> same<00:00:50.670> type<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:50.969> enemies<00:00:51.510> if

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
enemies and the same type of enemies if

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.110 
enemies and the same type of enemies if
you<00:00:51.899> match<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.379> rounds<00:00:52.739> up<00:00:52.910> there<00:00:53.910> is

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
you match the rounds up there is

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.510 
you match the rounds up there is
absolutely<00:00:54.840> no<00:00:55.230> difference<00:00:55.500> beyond<00:00:56.280> that

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
absolutely no difference beyond that

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.880 
absolutely no difference beyond that
besides<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.390> actual<00:00:57.629> damage<00:00:58.410> they<00:00:58.530> do<00:00:58.590> and

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
besides the actual damage they do and

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.459 
besides the actual damage they do and
the<00:00:59.010> health<00:00:59.280> that<00:00:59.520> they<00:00:59.670> have<00:00:59.910> now<00:01:00.600> as<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.379> can

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
the health that they have now as you can

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.009 
the health that they have now as you can
see<00:01:01.530> round<00:01:02.100> five<00:01:02.489> should<00:01:03.300> be<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.539> same<00:01:03.780> as

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
see round five should be the same as

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.050 
see round five should be the same as
round<00:01:04.409> 30<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:04.979> I'm<00:01:05.100> about<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.489> be<00:01:05.580> on<00:01:05.610> round

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
round 30 so I'm about to be on round

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.780 
round 30 so I'm about to be on round
five<00:01:06.330> subscript<00:01:06.960> 2<00:01:07.110> which<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:07.439> round<00:01:07.890> 30<00:01:08.189> and

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
five subscript 2 which is round 30 and

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.910 
five subscript 2 which is round 30 and
all<00:01:09.360> I'll<00:01:09.600> get<00:01:09.869> will<00:01:10.110> be<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.290> bunch<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.650> drones

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
all I'll get will be a bunch of drones

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.950 
all I'll get will be a bunch of drones
just<00:01:11.430> as<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.850> fills<00:01:12.090> round<00:01:12.360> 5<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.750> only

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
just as it fills round 5 the only

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.570 
just as it fills round 5 the only
difference<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:14.130> they'll<00:01:14.310> take

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
difference is that is that they'll take

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.820 
difference is that is that they'll take
a<00:01:14.610> few<00:01:14.939> more<00:01:15.119> hits<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.509> kill<00:01:15.540> but<00:01:16.350> it's<00:01:16.590> almost

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
a few more hits to kill but it's almost

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.190 
a few more hits to kill but it's almost
negligible<00:01:17.430> at<00:01:17.850> this<00:01:18.030> point<00:01:18.299> when<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.930> start

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
negligible at this point when you start

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.539 
negligible at this point when you start
getting<00:01:19.229> into<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.710> hundreds<00:01:20.159> then<00:01:20.369> you'll

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
getting into the hundreds then you'll

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.160 
getting into the hundreds then you'll
start<00:01:20.790> seeing<00:01:20.850> how<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.390> takes<00:01:21.600> quite<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.930> few

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
start seeing how it takes quite a few

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.480 
start seeing how it takes quite a few
more<00:01:22.350> hits<00:01:22.590> in<00:01:22.710> order<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:22.979> actually<00:01:23.130> kill

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
more hits in order to actually kill

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.330 
more hits in order to actually kill
enemies<00:01:23.880> but<00:01:24.420> at<00:01:24.689> this<00:01:24.900> point<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.439> basically

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
enemies but at this point is basically

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.060 
enemies but at this point is basically
the<00:01:26.520> same<00:01:26.759> exact<00:01:27.180> round<00:01:27.570> as<00:01:27.869> rounds<00:01:28.409> 1<00:01:28.799> through

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
the same exact round as rounds 1 through

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.810 
the same exact round as rounds 1 through
25<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:30.210> will<00:01:30.630> be<00:01:30.810> almost<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.890> same<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.640> will

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
25 it will be almost the same you will

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.899 
25 it will be almost the same you will
hardly<00:01:33.060> be<00:01:33.329> able<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.810> tell<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:33.990> difference<00:01:34.409> and

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
hardly be able to tell a difference and

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.840 
hardly be able to tell a difference and
just<00:01:35.909> like<00:01:36.030> around<00:01:36.570> eight<00:01:36.990> round<00:01:37.710> 33<00:01:38.460> you'll

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
just like around eight round 33 you'll

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.090 
just like around eight round 33 you'll
be<00:01:39.030> getting<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.570> invisible<00:01:40.530> enemies<00:01:40.890> and

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
be getting the invisible enemies and

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.330 
be getting the invisible enemies and
same<00:01:41.460> thing<00:01:41.729> for<00:01:42.030> around<00:01:42.600> 35<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.710> round<00:01:43.950> 10

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
same thing for around 35 to round 10

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.010 
same thing for around 35 to round 10
you'll<00:01:44.939> be<00:01:45.119> only<00:01:45.390> getting<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.229> goliaths<00:01:48.020> how

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
you'll be only getting the goliaths how

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.200 
you'll be only getting the goliaths how
to<00:01:49.079> read<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.710> rounds<00:01:50.189> is<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:50.790> take<00:01:51.030> the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
to read the rounds is that you take the

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.330 
to read the rounds is that you take the
subscript<00:01:51.780> number<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.350> can<00:01:52.380> see<00:01:52.680> mine<00:01:53.040> was

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
subscript number so you can see mine was

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.969 
subscript number so you can see mine was
round<00:01:53.700> 10<00:01:54.030> subscript<00:01:54.720> 3<00:01:54.930> so<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.680> take<00:01:55.860> the

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
round 10 subscript 3 so you take the

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.760 
round 10 subscript 3 so you take the
subscript<00:01:56.460> 2<00:01:56.579> 3<00:01:56.909> u<00:01:57.390> minus<00:01:57.659> 1<00:01:58.049> from<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:58.710> you

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
subscript 2 3 u minus 1 from that so you

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.609 
subscript 2 3 u minus 1 from that so you
get<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.700> multiply<00:02:00.149> that<00:02:00.180> by<00:02:00.390> 25<00:02:01.110> which<00:02:01.590> is

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
get to you multiply that by 25 which is

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.870 
get to you multiply that by 25 which is
50<00:02:02.250> then<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.030> take<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.329> 50<00:02:03.689> and<00:02:03.869> add<00:02:04.110> the

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
50 then you take that 50 and add the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.520 
50 then you take that 50 and add the
original<00:02:05.880> number<00:02:06.000> which<00:02:06.360> will<00:02:06.659> be<00:02:06.780> 10

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
original number which will be 10

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.350 
original number which will be 10
so<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:07.890> means<00:02:08.100> I'm<00:02:08.220> around<00:02:08.580> 60<00:02:09.090> at<00:02:09.209> this

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
so that means I'm around 60 at this

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.780 
so that means I'm around 60 at this
point<00:02:09.660> so<00:02:10.229> that<00:02:10.259> is<00:02:10.619> actually<00:02:10.830> how<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.310> read

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
point so that is actually how to read

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.420 
point so that is actually how to read
the<00:02:11.819> actual<00:02:12.300> rounds<00:02:13.140> for<00:02:13.440> EXO<00:02:13.830> survival<00:02:13.980> it's

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
the actual rounds for EXO survival it's

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.010 
the actual rounds for EXO survival it's
a<00:02:14.520> little<00:02:14.790> bit<00:02:14.880> confusing<00:02:15.300> at<00:02:15.480> first<00:02:15.540> but<00:02:15.959> I

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
a little bit confusing at first but I

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.500 
a little bit confusing at first but I
know<00:02:16.110> you<00:02:16.290> guys<00:02:16.470> can<00:02:16.740> get<00:02:16.890> really<00:02:17.130> fast<00:02:17.430> uh<00:02:17.670> it

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
know you guys can get really fast uh it

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.570 
know you guys can get really fast uh it
was<00:02:18.720> a<00:02:18.750> little<00:02:19.020> bit<00:02:19.170> weird<00:02:19.740> seeing<00:02:20.430> her

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
was a little bit weird seeing her

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.910 
was a little bit weird seeing her
originally<00:02:21.090> I<00:02:21.120> would<00:02:21.540> much<00:02:21.810> rather<00:02:21.870> have<00:02:22.380> say

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
originally I would much rather have say

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.920 
originally I would much rather have say
the<00:02:23.280> actual<00:02:23.730> round<00:02:23.910> you<00:02:24.000> have<00:02:24.209> instead<00:02:24.569> of<00:02:24.720> all

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
the actual round you have instead of all

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.290 
the actual round you have instead of all
this<00:02:25.110> uh<00:02:25.350> all<00:02:26.100> these<00:02:26.550> numbers<00:02:26.819> that<00:02:27.270> you

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
this uh all these numbers that you

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.780 
this uh all these numbers that you
actually<00:02:27.510> have<00:02:27.750> to<00:02:27.840> figure<00:02:28.500> out<00:02:28.770> but<00:02:29.340> oh<00:02:29.489> well

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
actually have to figure out but oh well

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.360 
actually have to figure out but oh well
whatever<00:02:30.480> so<00:02:31.200> that's<00:02:31.560> it<00:02:31.739> for<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.950> video<00:02:32.040> guys

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
whatever so that's it for the video guys
