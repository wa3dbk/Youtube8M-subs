Peggy<00:00:01.420> seven

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.189 

the<00:00:39.760> creatures<00:00:40.180> and<00:00:40.359> book<00:00:40.539> of<00:00:40.629> spells<00:00:40.809> are

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:41.199 
the creatures and book of spells are

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:43.500 
the creatures and book of spells are
created<00:00:41.769> from<00:00:42.070> the<00:00:42.129> text<00:00:42.910> and<00:00:43.120> the

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
created from the text and the

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.130 
created from the text and the
illustrations<00:00:44.260> of<00:00:44.440> the<00:00:44.589> book<00:00:46.140> when

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
illustrations of the book when

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.520 
illustrations of the book when
developing<00:00:47.829> the<00:00:48.399> creatures<00:00:49.089> we<00:00:49.719> start<00:00:50.260> off

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
developing the creatures we start off

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.410 
developing the creatures we start off
with<00:00:51.280> a<00:00:51.309> design<00:00:51.940> from<00:00:52.329> the<00:00:52.409> game<00:00:53.409> designers

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
with a design from the game designers

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.969 
with a design from the game designers
outlining<00:00:55.420> where<00:00:55.960> they're<00:00:56.260> going<00:00:56.469> to<00:00:56.589> be<00:00:56.680> used

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:56.979 
outlining where they're going to be used

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:00.370 
outlining where they're going to be used
in<00:00:57.219> the<00:00:57.339> game

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:00.380 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.190 

from<00:01:00.980> there<00:01:01.370> I<00:01:01.760> would<00:01:02.240> sit<00:01:02.540> down<00:01:02.570> and<00:01:02.990> work

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:03.200 
from there I would sit down and work

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.270 
from there I would sit down and work
with<00:01:03.680> a<00:01:03.920> concept<00:01:04.550> artist<00:01:05.030> to<00:01:06.070> flesh<00:01:07.070> out

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
with a concept artist to flesh out

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.970 
with a concept artist to flesh out
initial<00:01:07.880> sketches<00:01:08.150> and<00:01:08.570> ideas<00:01:08.800> what<00:01:09.800> these

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:09.980 
initial sketches and ideas what these

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.100 
initial sketches and ideas what these
things<00:01:10.010> are<00:01:10.460> going<00:01:10.640> to<00:01:10.730> look<00:01:10.850> like

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.430 

you've<00:01:14.710> got<00:01:14.890> the<00:01:15.070> initial<00:01:15.600> model<00:01:16.600> what<00:01:17.290> it

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
you've got the initial model what it

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.380 
you've got the initial model what it
looks<00:01:17.680> like<00:01:17.920> its<00:01:18.160> form<00:01:18.430> its<00:01:18.640> structure<00:01:19.210> its

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
looks like its form its structure its

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.380 
looks like its form its structure its
coloring<00:01:20.350> and<00:01:20.530> then<00:01:21.340> we<00:01:21.550> need<00:01:21.790> to<00:01:21.970> try<00:01:22.270> and

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
coloring and then we need to try and

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.910 
coloring and then we need to try and
make<00:01:22.450> it<00:01:22.510> move

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.880 

when<00:01:26.920> we<00:01:27.100> get<00:01:27.280> involved<00:01:27.550> obviously<00:01:28.390> we<00:01:29.020> we

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
when we get involved obviously we we

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.180 
when we get involved obviously we we
have<00:01:30.130> to<00:01:30.990> allow<00:01:31.990> these<00:01:32.410> characters<00:01:32.860> to<00:01:32.980> move

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
have to allow these characters to move

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.710 
have to allow these characters to move
we<00:01:33.520> have<00:01:33.640> to<00:01:33.790> give<00:01:33.910> them<00:01:34.030> the<00:01:34.210> means<00:01:34.420> to<00:01:34.600> do

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
we have to give them the means to do

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.190 
we have to give them the means to do
that<00:01:34.930> and<00:01:35.430> for<00:01:36.430> that<00:01:36.520> we<00:01:36.760> build<00:01:37.000> a<00:01:37.210> skeleton

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
that and for that we build a skeleton

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.040 
that and for that we build a skeleton
that<00:01:38.590> you<00:01:38.890> can<00:01:39.190> basically<00:01:39.400> place<00:01:39.880> inside<00:01:40.360> that

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
that you can basically place inside that

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.370 
that you can basically place inside that
model<00:01:41.440> and<00:01:42.270> once<00:01:43.270> that's<00:01:43.480> complete<00:01:43.990> we<00:01:44.350> can

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
model and once that's complete we can

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.550 
model and once that's complete we can
then<00:01:44.860> effectively<00:01:45.760> automate<00:01:46.420> parts<00:01:47.350> of<00:01:47.470> that

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
then effectively automate parts of that

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.400 
then effectively automate parts of that
skeleton<00:01:48.040> so<00:01:49.030> you<00:01:49.090> can<00:01:49.450> put<00:01:49.570> a<00:01:49.630> control<00:01:50.050> on<00:01:50.230> the

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
skeleton so you can put a control on the

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.200 
skeleton so you can put a control on the
hand<00:01:50.650> and<00:01:50.890> then<00:01:51.220> when<00:01:51.400> you<00:01:51.490> grab<00:01:51.670> that<00:01:51.700> control

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
hand and then when you grab that control

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.850 
hand and then when you grab that control
you<00:01:52.690> can<00:01:52.870> just<00:01:53.050> move<00:01:53.170> it<00:01:53.320> around<00:01:53.380> like<00:01:53.680> that

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
you can just move it around like that

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.560 
you can just move it around like that
and<00:01:54.220> it's<00:01:54.490> nice<00:01:54.610> and<00:01:54.790> easy<00:01:54.940> it<00:01:55.180> just<00:01:55.240> works

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
and it's nice and easy it just works

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.740 
and it's nice and easy it just works
itself<00:01:55.870> out<00:01:57.119> we<00:01:58.119> do<00:01:58.360> that<00:01:58.540> the<00:01:58.720> whole

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
itself out we do that the whole

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.200 
itself out we do that the whole
character<00:01:59.200> and<00:01:59.610> and<00:02:00.610> then<00:02:00.729> when<00:02:00.880> we<00:02:00.910> finish

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
character and and then when we finish

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.520 
character and and then when we finish
with<00:02:01.300> that<00:02:01.479> we<00:02:01.750> can<00:02:01.900> pass<00:02:02.080> it<00:02:02.200> over<00:02:02.320> to<00:02:02.380> the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
with that we can pass it over to the

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.480 
with that we can pass it over to the
character<00:02:02.830> animators

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.029 

my<00:02:07.119> favorite<00:02:07.509> part<00:02:07.659> in<00:02:08.080> animation<00:02:08.950> is

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
my favorite part in animation is

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.809 
my favorite part in animation is
actually<00:02:10.030> the<00:02:10.290> planning<00:02:11.290> the<00:02:11.620> research<00:02:12.430> and

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
actually the planning the research and

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.210 
actually the planning the research and
and<00:02:13.440> going<00:02:14.440> and<00:02:14.560> thinking<00:02:14.890> about<00:02:15.040> the

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
and going and thinking about the

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.990 
and going and thinking about the
character<00:02:15.580> and<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:16.120> personality<00:02:16.510> and<00:02:16.930> and

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
character and the personality and and

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.420 
character and the personality and and
what<00:02:19.000> I<00:02:19.030> would<00:02:19.330> think<00:02:19.690> and<00:02:20.160> how<00:02:21.160> they<00:02:21.190> would

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
what I would think and how they would

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.670 
what I would think and how they would
act<00:02:21.730> I<00:02:22.090> would<00:02:22.390> I<00:02:22.569> would<00:02:22.750> you<00:02:23.650> know

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
act I would I would you know

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.880 
act I would I would you know
specifically<00:02:24.690> reacting<00:02:25.690> to<00:02:26.260> a<00:02:26.290> certain

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
specifically reacting to a certain

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.220 
specifically reacting to a certain
situation

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.430 

and<00:02:31.099> then<00:02:31.610> once<00:02:31.790> we<00:02:31.909> have<00:02:32.090> this<00:02:32.239> creatures<00:02:32.989> got

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
and then once we have this creatures got

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.899 
and then once we have this creatures got
certain<00:02:33.709> animations<00:02:34.190> then<00:02:34.430> I'll<00:02:34.519> you<00:02:34.879> know

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:34.909 
certain animations then I'll you know

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:36.570 
certain animations then I'll you know
combine<00:02:35.360> these<00:02:35.510> together<00:02:35.720> and<00:02:35.989> it<00:02:36.170> really

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
combine these together and it really

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:43.070 
combine these together and it really
brings<00:02:37.580> that<00:02:37.849> original<00:02:38.299> concept<00:02:38.720> of<00:02:38.810> life

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.530 

I<00:02:43.250> think<00:02:44.250> one<00:02:44.430> of<00:02:44.460> my<00:02:44.610> favorite<00:02:45.000> creatures<00:02:45.360> to

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
I think one of my favorite creatures to

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.110 
I think one of my favorite creatures to
develop<00:02:45.900> was<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.230> dragon<00:02:46.730> mostly<00:02:47.730> because<00:02:47.850> it

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
develop was the dragon mostly because it

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.000 
develop was the dragon mostly because it
was<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.480> first<00:02:48.660> creature<00:02:49.050> I<00:02:49.200> got<00:02:49.440> my<00:02:49.590> hands<00:02:49.920> on

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
was the first creature I got my hands on

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.920 
was the first creature I got my hands on
so<00:02:50.310> I<00:02:50.340> could<00:02:50.640> experiment<00:02:50.970> a<00:02:51.300> bit<00:02:51.330> and<00:02:51.630> see<00:02:51.900> what

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
so I could experiment a bit and see what

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.960 
so I could experiment a bit and see what
worked<00:02:52.320> and<00:02:52.440> what<00:02:52.530> didn't<00:02:52.980> work<00:02:53.130> and<00:02:53.460> I

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
worked and what didn't work and I

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.400 
worked and what didn't work and I
discovered<00:02:54.330> I<00:02:54.570> could<00:02:54.630> combine<00:02:54.930> different

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
discovered I could combine different

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.640 
discovered I could combine different
animals<00:02:55.980> to<00:02:56.340> make<00:02:56.520> a<00:02:56.730> new<00:02:56.970> one<00:02:57.290> so<00:02:58.290> for<00:02:58.590> example

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650

animals to make a new one so for example
with<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.250> dragon<00:02:59.670> I<00:02:59.820> combined<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.840> leopard<00:03:01.320> a

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
with the dragon I combined a leopard a

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.040 
with the dragon I combined a leopard a
vulture<00:03:02.250> and<00:03:02.490> a<00:03:02.670> pig<00:03:02.910> to<00:03:03.360> make<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.690> Dragons

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
vulture and a pig to make the Dragons

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:10.310 
vulture and a pig to make the Dragons
voice<00:03:07.820> but<00:03:08.820> the<00:03:08.970> Dragons<00:03:09.360> movements<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.140> wing

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
voice but the Dragons movements and wing

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.040 
voice but the Dragons movements and wing
flaps<00:03:10.590> are<00:03:10.860> actually<00:03:11.480> sourced<00:03:12.480> from<00:03:12.660> fire

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
flaps are actually sourced from fire

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.530 
flaps are actually sourced from fire
sounds<00:03:13.650> so<00:03:14.130> any<00:03:14.280> time<00:03:14.490> you<00:03:14.640> hear<00:03:14.850> a<00:03:15.090> dragon

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
sounds so any time you hear a dragon

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.030 
sounds so any time you hear a dragon
flapping<00:03:15.960> his<00:03:16.080> wings<00:03:16.140> it's<00:03:16.590> actually<00:03:16.950> the

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
flapping his wings it's actually the

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:24.520 
flapping his wings it's actually the
sound<00:03:17.250> of<00:03:17.400> a<00:03:17.490> fireball<00:03:22.910> the<00:03:23.910> characters

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
sound of a fireball the characters

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.370 
sound of a fireball the characters
definitely<00:03:25.530> go<00:03:25.680> through<00:03:25.980> a<00:03:26.810> process<00:03:27.810> of

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
definitely go through a process of

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.550 
definitely go through a process of
development<00:03:29.190> where<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.390> might<00:03:30.570> start<00:03:30.900> off<00:03:31.080> we

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
development where the might start off we

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.560 
development where the might start off we
might<00:03:31.740> think<00:03:31.920> of<00:03:32.070> them<00:03:32.310> in<00:03:32.580> one<00:03:32.940> way<00:03:33.330> at<00:03:33.540> first

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
might think of them in one way at first

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.890 
might think of them in one way at first
and<00:03:34.200> then<00:03:34.709> as<00:03:34.950> we<00:03:35.310> work<00:03:35.760> through<00:03:35.790> the<00:03:36.120> through

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
and then as we work through the through

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.780 
and then as we work through the through
the<00:03:37.110> situations<00:03:37.740> that<00:03:37.890> they're<00:03:38.130> in<00:03:38.280> we<00:03:38.610> might

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
the situations that they're in we might

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.850 
the situations that they're in we might
think<00:03:39.000> of<00:03:39.180> different<00:03:40.110> the<00:03:40.230> more<00:03:40.380> entertaining

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
think of different the more entertaining

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.790 
think of different the more entertaining
ways<00:03:41.240> for<00:03:42.240> them<00:03:42.330> to<00:03:42.390> sort<00:03:42.870> of<00:03:42.959> express<00:03:43.560> their

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
ways for them to sort of express their

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.650 
ways for them to sort of express their
their<00:03:44.160> personalities

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.710 

I<00:03:47.860> think<00:03:48.860> the<00:03:48.920> reason<00:03:49.040> kids<00:03:49.430> love<00:03:50.000> creatures

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
I think the reason kids love creatures

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.660 
I think the reason kids love creatures
and<00:03:51.110> especially<00:03:51.620> creatures<00:03:52.070> in<00:03:52.190> games<00:03:52.430> is

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
and especially creatures in games is

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.420 
and especially creatures in games is
because<00:03:53.000> of<00:03:53.600> their<00:03:53.930> fantastical<00:03:54.590> nature<00:03:54.920> they

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
because of their fantastical nature they

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.720 
because of their fantastical nature they
take<00:03:55.700> you<00:03:55.880> to<00:03:56.090> another<00:03:56.300> world<00:03:57.190> you<00:03:58.190> don't<00:03:58.460> see

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
take you to another world you don't see

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.490 
take you to another world you don't see
them<00:03:58.940> in<00:03:59.330> everyday<00:03:59.900> life<00:04:01.060> so<00:04:02.060> to<00:04:02.380> come<00:04:03.380> up

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
them in everyday life so to come up

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.620 
them in everyday life so to come up
against<00:04:03.890> them<00:04:04.040> and<00:04:04.250> see<00:04:04.850> how<00:04:04.880> they<00:04:05.210> actually

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
against them and see how they actually

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.920 
against them and see how they actually
move<00:04:06.560> and<00:04:06.890> how<00:04:07.010> they<00:04:07.190> react<00:04:07.550> is<00:04:07.880> is<00:04:08.450> something

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
move and how they react is is something

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:24.070 
move and how they react is is something
that<00:04:09.020> kids<00:04:09.290> really<00:04:09.410> love

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.139
