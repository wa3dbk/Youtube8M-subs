left<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.420> card<00:01:12.659> that's<00:01:13.229> all<00:01:13.409> there<00:01:13.560> really

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:13.620 
left on the card that's all there really

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.430 
left on the card that's all there really
is<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.970> camera<00:01:15.240> sends<00:01:15.870> the<00:01:15.990> signal<00:01:16.320> and

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:16.440 
is to it the camera sends the signal and

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.980 
is to it the camera sends the signal and
it<00:01:16.530> detects<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:17.100> signal<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:18.299> in<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.600> camera

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
it detects that signal so in the camera

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.359 
it detects that signal so in the camera
though<00:01:19.170> there's<00:01:19.619> some<00:01:19.770> settings<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.189> choose

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
though there's some settings to choose

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.740 
though there's some settings to choose
from<00:01:20.610> somebody<00:01:20.909> go<00:01:20.969> to<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.090> menus<00:01:21.390> here<00:01:21.630> and

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
here but a record set and then I can see

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.770 
here but a record set and then I can see
this<00:01:27.810> top<00:01:28.049> line<00:01:28.289> here<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.590> have<00:01:29.329> the<00:01:30.329> option<00:01:30.750> to

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
this top line here I have the option to

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.679 
this top line here I have the option to
choose<00:01:30.930> between<00:01:31.020> raw<00:01:31.409> HD<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.520> SD<00:01:32.609> choose<00:01:33.509> raw

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
choose between raw HD and SD choose raw

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.539 
choose between raw HD and SD choose raw
here<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.140> then<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.259> go<00:01:34.500> down<00:01:34.530> choose<00:01:35.369> between

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
here and then I go down choose between

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.730 
here and then I go down choose between
two<00:01:35.909> simultaneous<00:01:36.689> recording<00:01:36.960> option<00:01:37.469> on<00:01:37.590> or

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
two simultaneous recording option on or

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.260 
two simultaneous recording option on or
off<00:01:37.859> that's<00:01:38.189> gonna<00:01:38.310> enabled<00:01:38.700> me<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:38.939> either

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
off that's gonna enabled me to either

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.289 
off that's gonna enabled me to either
just<00:01:39.810> record<00:01:40.140> only<00:01:40.320> raw<00:01:40.710> both<00:01:41.399> raw<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.939> the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
just record only raw both raw and the

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.749 
just record only raw both raw and the
ABC<00:01:42.929> HD<00:01:43.020> at<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.500> same<00:01:43.679> time<00:01:43.979> this<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.609> really

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
ABC HD at the same time this is a really

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.910 
ABC HD at the same time this is a really
nice<00:01:44.969> option<00:01:45.210> because<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:46.170> raw<00:01:46.320> signal<00:01:46.590> will

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
nice option because the raw signal will

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.669 
nice option because the raw signal will
remain<00:01:47.340> clean<00:01:48.179> raw<00:01:48.479> data<00:01:48.719> while<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.409> can

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:49.679 
remain clean raw data while I can

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:51.620 
remain clean raw data while I can
actually<00:01:49.950> put<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.340> picture<00:01:51.149> profile

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
actually put a picture profile

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.179 
actually put a picture profile
essentially<00:01:52.049> on<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.380> internal<00:01:52.770> recording

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
essentially on the internal recording

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.149 
essentially on the internal recording
and<00:01:53.369> have<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.090> nice<00:01:54.329> combination<00:01:55.229> offline

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
and have a nice combination offline

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.359 
and have a nice combination offline
online<00:01:56.369> init<00:01:56.820> option<00:01:57.719> so<00:01:58.289> and<00:01:58.740> do<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.100> and

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
online init option so and do that and
