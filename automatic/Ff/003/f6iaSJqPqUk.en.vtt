00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.780
 Hello, I'm on my first song 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.540
 delete was valid 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.980
 I wanted to start with it because I think 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.870
 It's easy to play 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.900
 and in my opinion one of the best 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.990
 job because he can get away pretty quickly 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.869
 directing run to learn is good jungle 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.580
 makes massive damage and is the aisle 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.519
 Of course, top-value you more, too 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:27.269
 a team has played so i wanted as 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:30.420
 first the attacks start the passive one 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.579
 phase of the war by passive cool her 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.860
 animal not with units that is you 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.300
 you can just go through it 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:41.969
 that, of course, to think as well 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:45.600
 your walking speed changes in attack 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.550
 and that helps, of course, because 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.010
 Of course you will need a lot of speed 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.809
 to set of steering to run and the 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:57.300
 is actually only top of the q12 hot 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.699
 berserker with the strokes once over 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.120
 it's all about harming everyone's circle 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:06.750
 Of course good for driving and also in the 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:10.020
 jungle mental fright of 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.610
 The film brings you fright 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.470
 jungle because it heals you 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.799
 it makes a circle around you and that 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.740
 harm happens in this circle one 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.090
 part of that crochet old and that is 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.310
 Also very good in the team wrong something 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.720
 just jump in the circle to make 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.430
 and part of the harm done in the 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.560
 orbit does not matter to all opponents 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.320
 whether that be true now neutral monster 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.530
 or just champion are Heinrich 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:38.549
 partly cool it is 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.430
 devastating onslaught he gets 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:45.090
 for a short time more walking speed that rises 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:48.540
 in the time during the run and the 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:52.890
 next attack repels the opponent 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.720
 Of course top to think and I mean 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.159
 You can also good when you are grubert 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:01.979
 use to country by country running 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:04.729
 yes and the special thing about it is 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.990
 they enabled the more distance you 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.060
 leaves while activated is all the more 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.560
 he will do more harm when next 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.630
 attack 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.640
 so should already at the multi onslaught of the 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:20.890
 shadow with it if you use that 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.620
 Can you follow a big distance 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.840
 jump ahead and all the opponents are hers 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.580
 makes you hurt and where he is 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.620
 Of course you can land yourself 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.050
 You will also see where you are 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.880
 ends up doing more harm and more 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.800
 makes a shock wave with which you 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.540
 other opponents of fear shifted called her 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.230
 40 you can do this four and a half 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:44.920
 seconds and stunned so I would as 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:48.370
 first kuske then ws belong to each 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:51.220
 fall lukas start in the jungle so 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.320
 cool for only then w and then could 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.209
 google with three of benches would want 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.140
 I recommend but I'm only with 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.790
 four courses 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.580
 That's why I would again the 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.110
 go ko's and then to direct only de 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.730
 you could just like the lanes right now 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.070
 you can stand you have to stop that 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.250
 match then do cow like that 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.830
 first up then of course dwd de because 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.720
 it's actually good for thinking and the 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.720
 Ultimate, of course, always play so far 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.150
 it works so there goes on to continue 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.430
 old picture should be the first one I would 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.830
 of course armor and five 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.739
 poland with bluetooth initially needs 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:29.709
 one should not drink a good drink then he goes 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:32.080
 So long drive to your madrid 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:36.070
 can get carvers and normal shoes 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:38.440
 best you still keep daddy 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.019
 beverages and take but so you know 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.459
 probably already from the name 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:45.940
 then he makes one first 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:49.989
 lantern from it and the merkur shoes for 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:53.320
 yes, the school bring in anesthesia and 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:55.269
 something like that is not so long and there 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:59.110
 naturally brings pretty much what because 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:00.970
 of course you in the club jumps as 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.220
 I would not go next 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.480
 because that brings a lot 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.890
 it brings you critical brings you 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.450
 Damage is brought by running pace 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.910
 just everything you have with him 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:13.540
 need can because I'm in such a 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:16.030
 art of hank so next i would 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.190
 then get the phantom dancer because he 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.020
 bring you madrid pace and how 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.280
 said by passive Lauftempo same 

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:25.030
 attack damage 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:29.530
 that just get top box because then 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:31.120
 It's getting risky because most of them are 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.520
 well guided time when she was fine and 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.480
 They then focus on you anyway 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.400
 I would like that then afterwards 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.889
 once again the sound of 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.470
 get infinity because you have enough 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:49.030
 rode and that makes him even more 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:51.630
 harm and besides yes then he tears 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.550
 just take the opponents apart faster 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:58.120
 then the championships 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:00.750
 the games on 21 09 of course 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:04.780
 attack fully on harm and go 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:06.210
 slip through and know 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.470
 I have set nine points 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.780
 the first one I set some think 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.690
 maybe why and why me 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.570
 This is the most meaningful of everything 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:18.400
 because you will not die so fast 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.780
 because by flash you can get away with it 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.630
 you and you can overpower yourself 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.790
 Jump and ski later 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.800
 often have speedphone 700 I would 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:30.250
 also get no more but stop 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.720
 mahner for jungle was running pace 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.130
 running tempo is come off faster 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.840
 could be faster and through the 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:37.090
 Passive naturally have more attack 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:40.479
 then I have a point on it 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:44.140
 set that buffs of blue and red 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:45.070
 and beg for longer because of me 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:50.560
 my lack of that 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:53.979
 intelligence so i play mostly with 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:56.680
 flash and crash shatter 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:58.419
 is clear because jungle and flash old there 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.270
 comes he comes quickly behind 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:02.500
 if you wash them or to stop then 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.490
 could get away quickly 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:08.590
 but you could also flash through it 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:10.270
 Ghost exchange with spirit he comes 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.979
 faster always behind 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.840
 and that could be good in the fight too 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:15.130
 use if in short supply because there is 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.710
 you run pace the comparison 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:19.090
 start attack and with it you can 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:22.050
 not too good at breaking down though 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:25.380
 anyway, it's still favorite flash 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.380
 a few tips 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:30.519
 yes as I said stop-spirited scare 

00:06:28.329 --> 00:06:32.139
 restore life if the enemy 

00:06:30.519 --> 00:06:33.759
 even if they suffer from damage 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:36.069
 allies were caused 

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:37.929
 use ability in big fight around 

00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:39.459
 to increase endurance 

00:06:37.929 --> 00:06:43.209
 I already explained that, even from 

00:06:39.459 --> 00:06:45.489
 from champion and that's how life becomes 

00:06:43.209 --> 00:06:48.429
 yes synonymous part of the damage again 

00:06:45.489 --> 00:06:50.069
 as we do not live in the onslaught 

00:06:48.429 --> 00:06:52.869
 causes more damage 

00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:55.689
 depending on how far around before that 

00:06:52.869 --> 00:06:57.939
 has moved so I have already 

00:06:55.689 --> 00:07:01.539
 explained and so more you halter circulating 

00:06:57.939 --> 00:07:04.329
 made the game more harm 

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:06.009
 then with the attack so i can like that 

00:07:04.329 --> 00:07:07.329
 said try a combination with 

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:10.239
 onslaught of damage as with the 

00:07:07.329 --> 00:07:12.759
 ultimate and with conjuror conjure like 

00:07:10.239 --> 00:07:14.759
 ghost or lightning and as much harm as 

00:07:12.759 --> 00:07:17.619
 possible to cause 

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:19.059
 as I have ever examples you see 

00:07:17.619 --> 00:07:22.809
 all of them from last days on 

00:07:19.059 --> 00:07:24.069
 played one day and there I have 

00:07:22.809 --> 00:07:25.389
 Just once I played three times 

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:31.239
 The day you see pretty much three times 

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:33.369
 good 15 45 10 15 06 and 16 08 and everything 

00:07:31.239 --> 00:07:34.599
 jungle everything with the old picture and the 

00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:36.759
 is pretty easy to play 

00:07:34.599 --> 00:07:38.439
 I wish you a lot of fun, I hope 

00:07:36.759 --> 00:07:43.149
 you have fallen because my first guide 

00:07:38.439 --> 00:07:45.219
 I would be happy about subscribers thumbs 

00:07:43.149 --> 00:07:48.599
 high course and definitely 

00:07:45.219 --> 00:07:48.599
 Thank you very much
