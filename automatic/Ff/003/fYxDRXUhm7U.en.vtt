to a Kerouac's cube in 9.2 seconds watch

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.530 
to a Kerouac's cube in 9.2 seconds watch
closely

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:08.540 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.180

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.379 
thing that you need is a scrambled
rubik's<00:00:13.860> cube<00:00:14.160> so<00:00:14.460> let's<00:00:14.790> just<00:00:15.059> start<00:00:15.269> with

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
rubik's cube so let's just start with

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.170 
rubik's cube so let's just start with
that

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:22.180 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.830
