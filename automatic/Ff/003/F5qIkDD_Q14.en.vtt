00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:08.350
 hi i am very good 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:11.350
 and today we are going to teach you how to do 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.350
 jelly 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.520
 and to make this delicious jelly 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.520
 we are going to need 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:26.360
 7.5 grams of grenadine 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.980
 in the transparent 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:32.940
 it's from being only 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.940
 250 milliliters of milk 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.510
 a quarter cup of sugar person 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.829
 approximately 50 grams 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.829
 a teaspoon of vanilla 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:49.390
 and good colorants the dyes are 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.730
 the bushes the color that you 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.280
 want to make gelatin 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.410
 I for example I will occupy green rose 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.890
 yellow and blue but you who 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.290
 want 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:04.489
 and for the water jelly I'm just going 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:09.580
 to change the milk for water that 50 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:12.480
 grams of sugar 7.5 grams of grenadine 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:16.050
 a spoonful of vanilla 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:18.090
 and my 150 millimeters of water 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.670
 this is not going to color until the 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.140
 I want transparent 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:26.330
 and let's start with the process 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.600
 and here I have 60 milliliters of water 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:32.350
 and 60 milliliters of milk I will hydrate 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.350
 my grenadine 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.560
 in the form of rain 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:55.570
 and I leave it 10 minutes 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.420
 resting 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.830
 what is hydrate micronet and I'm not going 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.770
 to teach the amounts that bags that are 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.390
 these are silicone come stuck me 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.240
 the cuts because it's easier 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.640
 handle them like that and then they put their little step 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.190
 down to be able to sustain it because if not 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.959
 you can not have if you do not get these 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.220
 good they sell them in any house of 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.830
 raw materials like the 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.190
 pork grenadine but if not 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:24.750
 they get like they sell little glasses of 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.750
 plastic can we do in those 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.290
 and I'm going to throw out the sugar 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.300
 and in the water 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.090
 vanilla 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.940
 I'm going to return it 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.850
 the same in the water the vanilla 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.180
 and sugar to water too 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.819
 and here is my grenadine hydrated the 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.910
 I'm going to milk it in the microwave 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.610
 approximately 15 seconds for it to 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.090
 melt 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.340
 I start with the fact because I need 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.989
 he 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:22.030
 that set faster because I beat my 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.209
 I'm going to take the rest of the 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.209
 milk 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:34.250
 where you have the sugar use sugar 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.410
 refined because if it goes where it is not there 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:40.690
 matter person of water if you use the 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:44.570
 normal sugar will be like coffee 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:48.820
 so it stays with the normal sugar have 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:48.820
 what to buy refined that is white 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:56.220
 and good here / milk jelly in the 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:01.220
 four colors that I told them I was going to use 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.220
 and nothing's going to stir 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.849
 since I have them painted here I have a 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.849
 mold cited I put a little bit of 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:12.269
 butter and I'm going to throw my grenetina 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.269
 pink 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:24.190
 and then put the fridge this I'm going to 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:27.360
 occupy to cut it with the cutters 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.360
 these little ones that I have 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.680
 then we will have as it is 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.680
 I'm going to cut it 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.139
 and here is the water one is not going to put 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:41.080
 microwave equal 15 seconds depending 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:43.529
 your microwave and then we're going to keep it 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.800
 with the water that I have left 

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:48.860
 I think my grenetina 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.860
 ah 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.540
 already the bulb was super good 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.800
 if it is this way it is transparent for the 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:05.569
 sugar 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.789
 and eight latina mic in this 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:10.569
 to work easier my good 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:10.569
 water jelly 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:14.569
 for what I'm going to do I 'm going to put a 

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:17.379
 bit 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:17.379
 copulation 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.630
 so that the bubbles are removed 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.120
 and I'm going to let it set 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:37.529
 and so I'm going to throw all the sued 

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:39.719
 that a little bit so they do not look at 

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:42.860
 paste anyway in the silicon is 

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:42.860
 less likely to stick 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:55.370
 and I know that my first blue jelly 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:58.210
 and I'm going to cut it out of little stars 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.210
 exist 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:05.050
 the molds of grasses lasted as a thousand 

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:05.050
 years about friends 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:16.090
 and I'm going to cut several stars like that 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:19.620
 and so I will do with all colors 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.620
 you can unmold them and I'm going to cut them 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:27.030
 and they are curdled 

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:29.289
 and I'm going to put those who cut is 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:31.919
 for example alice of two colors are 

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:31.919
 little flowers 

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.840
 and I'm going to start accommodating here 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:48.210
 then the other figures that want 

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:50.599
 the colors that they want more 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.599
 like 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:58.120
 and I'm going to finish filling with my 

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:11.509
 carefully so that they do not just move 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.509
 I'm going to put the refrigerator 

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:17.590
 to set 

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:20.430
 it's already in this curd I'm just going to 

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:20.430
 take off the little ears 

00:07:25.249 --> 00:07:30.270
 it clears super easy and there it is 

00:07:28.429 --> 00:07:33.510
 remains 

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:35.810
 is I put it below yellow on the 

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:35.810
 base 

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:40.410
 and this is completely transparent to 

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:42.150
 Personally, I like it better 

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:44.560
 transparent but you can 

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:46.090
 do as you want 

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.889
 the little stars their little flowers 

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:49.360
 heart 

00:07:47.889 --> 00:07:52.360
