00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
thing to be aware of is fertilizing you

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:08.080 
thing to be aware of is fertilizing you
can<00:04:05.810> sort<00:04:06.590> that<00:04:06.739> out<00:04:06.799> so<00:04:07.190> you<00:04:07.220> get<00:04:07.610> what<00:04:07.880> you

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
can sort that out so you get what you

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
really really should be putting on there

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:16.180 
really really should be putting on there
and<00:04:11.750> that<00:04:12.410> appears<00:04:12.920> a<00:04:13.040> few<00:04:13.280> times<00:04:13.599> just<00:04:14.599> for<00:04:15.530> an

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
and that appears a few times just for an

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.710 
and that appears a few times just for an
example<00:04:16.370> so<00:04:16.850> you<00:04:16.880> can<00:04:17.120> see<00:04:17.299> this<00:04:17.479> is<00:04:17.600> actually

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
example so you can see this is actually

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.500
