00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:41.510

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.550
 behind us a large section opens lead us 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:02.770
 there are experienced hard drive memory modules 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.770
 battery delivered 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:10.030

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:50.169
 I can't tell you what 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:51.940
 but apparently this port is transparent to 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.250
 connect external hard drives 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.850
 precisely because besides logoschik a

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:02.919
 Learn the hard drive logo 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:04.880
 it is intended for hard drives

 very thin very thin tonics 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:19.250
 nice here it seems to me that 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:21.410
 13 4 inches that's exactly what 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:25.550
 need paragliding portability and 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:29.960
 stationary work materials here 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:32.330
 a glossy matt material had 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:36.010
 No, it does not fill up exactly. 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:38.050

 little do not know Tikhonkaya soft 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:50.480
 pressing such well, it seems to me super as well 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.240
 turning on the omission key in that module 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:56.390
 higher mute 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:06:00.290

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.830
 dynamics in principle is normal 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:21.220
 collect already 15 dinars it seems what 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.390

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:46.180
