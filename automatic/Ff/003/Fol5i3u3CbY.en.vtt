00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
liked to have done this experiment a

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.690

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
quite a prolific garden and I wrapped

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.590 
quite a prolific garden and I wrapped
the<00:01:50.729> tomato<00:01:51.350> in<00:01:52.350> some<00:01:53.070> like<00:01:53.579> plastic<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.450> be

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
the tomato in some like plastic to be

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.700 
the tomato in some like plastic to be
able<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:54.990> give<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.289> little<00:01:55.500> greenhouse

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
able to give it a little greenhouse

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.109 
able to give it a little greenhouse
effect<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.460> heat<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.789> up<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:57.060> bit<00:01:58.159> and<00:01:59.159> in<00:01:59.789> order

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
effect to heat it up a bit and in order

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.480 
effect to heat it up a bit and in order
to<00:02:00.179> give<00:02:00.929> it<00:02:00.960> more<00:02:01.170> thermal<00:02:01.619> ability<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.399> more

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
to give it more thermal ability and more

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.459 
to give it more thermal ability and more
BTUs<00:02:03.000> so<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.479> tomatoes<00:02:03.869> will<00:02:03.990> actually<00:02:04.289> kick

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
BTUs so the tomatoes will actually kick

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.150 
BTUs so the tomatoes will actually kick
off<00:02:04.619> since<00:02:04.890> there's<00:02:05.069> such<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.390> warm<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:07.160> warm

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
off since there's such a warm a warm

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.820 
off since there's such a warm a warm
weather<00:02:09.060> area<00:02:09.509> of<00:02:09.720> warm<00:02:10.019> weather<00:02:10.140> plant<00:02:10.560> and

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
weather area of warm weather plant and

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.380 
weather area of warm weather plant and
we<00:02:10.950> definitely<00:02:11.190> don't<00:02:11.459> have<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.760> warm<00:02:12.060> summer

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
we definitely don't have a warm summer

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.619 
we definitely don't have a warm summer
here<00:02:12.660> so<00:02:13.470> what<00:02:13.680> happened<00:02:14.069> from<00:02:14.310> that<00:02:14.370> is<00:02:15.200> I<00:02:16.220> I

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
here so what happened from that is I I

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:20.680 
here so what happened from that is I I
environmentally<00:02:18.629> affected<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.319> plant<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:19.890> I

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
environmentally affected the plant and I

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.509 
environmentally affected the plant and I
developed<00:02:21.690> a<00:02:21.959> fungal<00:02:22.530> issue<00:02:23.010> on<00:02:23.280> it<00:02:23.400> I<00:02:23.459> don't

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
developed a fungal issue on it I don't

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:24.920 
developed a fungal issue on it I don't
know<00:02:23.670> if<00:02:23.790> you'll<00:02:23.910> be<00:02:24.060> able<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.390> get<00:02:24.540> in<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:24.780> see

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
know if you'll be able to get in and see

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.050 
know if you'll be able to get in and see
these<00:02:25.079> leaves<00:02:25.319> or<00:02:25.560> not<00:02:25.709> but<00:02:26.459> I<00:02:26.519> looked<00:02:26.700> up<00:02:26.880> this

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
these leaves or not but I looked up this

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.000 
these leaves or not but I looked up this
fungal<00:02:27.450> issue<00:02:27.599> and<00:02:28.079> you<00:02:28.590> know<00:02:28.680> I<00:02:28.709> was<00:02:28.799> getting

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
fungal issue and you know I was getting

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.430 
fungal issue and you know I was getting
this<00:02:29.069> kind<00:02:29.310> of<00:02:29.370> leaf<00:02:29.840> breakdown<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:31.140> whatnot

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
this kind of leaf breakdown and whatnot

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.280 
this kind of leaf breakdown and whatnot
this<00:02:32.190> is<00:02:32.370> called<00:02:32.549> early<00:02:32.910> blight<00:02:33.120> it's<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:34.049> it's

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
this is called early blight it's a it's

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.270 
this is called early blight it's a it's
a<00:02:34.440> soil<00:02:34.769> borne<00:02:35.459> fungal<00:02:35.910> disease<00:02:36.379> and<00:02:37.379> in<00:02:38.129> this

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
a soil borne fungal disease and in this

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.100 
a soil borne fungal disease and in this
case<00:02:38.489> it<00:02:38.640> environmentally<00:02:39.120> got<00:02:39.510> started

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
case it environmentally got started

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.199 
case it environmentally got started
because<00:02:40.620> I<00:02:40.890> wrapped<00:02:41.220> it<00:02:41.459> and<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:41.849> didn't<00:02:42.090> have

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
because I wrapped it and it didn't have

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:43.789 
because I wrapped it and it didn't have
enough<00:02:42.239> ventilation<00:02:42.810> left<00:02:43.349> circulation

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
enough ventilation left circulation

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.699 
enough ventilation left circulation
through<00:02:44.489> the<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:45.510> tomato<00:02:45.870> plant<00:02:46.200> during<00:02:46.530> the

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
through the the tomato plant during the

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.440 
through the the tomato plant during the
the<00:02:47.040> three<00:02:47.310> or<00:02:47.430> so<00:02:47.610> weeks<00:02:47.790> that<00:02:48.030> we<00:02:48.120> were<00:02:48.150> gone

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
the three or so weeks that we were gone

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.569 
the three or so weeks that we were gone
so<00:02:49.110> when<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.260> came<00:02:49.379> home<00:02:49.680> I<00:02:49.829> went<00:02:49.920> oh<00:02:50.069> no<00:02:50.099> I<00:02:50.489> know

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
so when I came home I went oh no I know

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:52.250 
so when I came home I went oh no I know
that's<00:02:50.849> what<00:02:51.000> about<00:02:51.180> my<00:02:51.299> experiment<00:02:52.019> and<00:02:52.170> this

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
that's what about my experiment and this

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.640 
that's what about my experiment and this
and<00:02:52.410> that<00:02:52.440> so<00:02:52.560> I<00:02:53.010> took<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:54.410> the<00:02:55.410> plastic

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
and that so I took the the the plastic

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.699 
and that so I took the the the plastic
wrap<00:02:56.100> off<00:02:56.370> of<00:02:56.609> it<00:02:56.790> and<00:02:57.230> I'm<00:02:58.230> like<00:02:58.410> well<00:02:58.590> this

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
wrap off of it and I'm like well this

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.160 
wrap off of it and I'm like well this
big<00:02:58.920> experiment<00:02:59.579> to<00:02:59.670> see<00:02:59.880> what<00:03:00.389> what<00:03:00.780> compost

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
big experiment to see what what compost

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.410 
big experiment to see what what compost
he's<00:03:01.440> going<00:03:01.620> to<00:03:01.709> do<00:03:01.799> for<00:03:02.010> this<00:03:02.209> all<00:03:03.209> the

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
he's going to do for this all the

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.690 
he's going to do for this all the
research<00:03:03.750> that<00:03:03.780> I<00:03:04.049> find<00:03:04.319> says<00:03:04.859> that<00:03:05.130> oh<00:03:05.340> boy

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
research that I find says that oh boy

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.490 
research that I find says that oh boy
early<00:03:06.090> blight

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
early blight

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.470 
early blight
it's<00:03:07.500> one<00:03:07.650> of<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.799> most<00:03:07.980> severe<00:03:08.370> diseases<00:03:09.299> you

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
it's one of the most severe diseases you

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.120 
it's one of the most severe diseases you
can<00:03:09.630> have<00:03:09.810> on<00:03:09.959> a<00:03:09.989> fungus<00:03:10.260> for<00:03:10.560> tomatoes<00:03:10.950> as

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
can have on a fungus for tomatoes as

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.129 
can have on a fungus for tomatoes as
well<00:03:11.280> as<00:03:11.430> potatoes<00:03:11.940> and<00:03:12.180> and<00:03:12.359> stuff<00:03:13.019> with

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:13.139 
well as potatoes and and stuff with

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:15.500 
well as potatoes and and stuff with
other<00:03:13.230> crops<00:03:13.530> out<00:03:13.829> there<00:03:14.069> so<00:03:14.790> I<00:03:14.819> did<00:03:15.209> soil

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
other crops out there so I did soil

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.050 
other crops out there so I did soil
branches<00:03:15.930> as<00:03:16.109> well<00:03:16.620> as<00:03:16.799> as<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.519> leaf<00:03:17.669> sprays

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
branches as well as as the leaf sprays

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.199 
branches as well as as the leaf sprays
the<00:03:18.419> foliar<00:03:18.750> feeding<00:03:19.019> and<00:03:20.030> what<00:03:21.030> you'll

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
the foliar feeding and what you'll

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.300 
the foliar feeding and what you'll
notice<00:03:21.359> is<00:03:21.720> as<00:03:22.109> I<00:03:22.230> go<00:03:22.410> further<00:03:22.680> up<00:03:22.859> to<00:03:23.069> plant

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
notice is as I go further up to plant

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.270 
notice is as I go further up to plant
there's<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:24.389> the<00:03:24.959> incident<00:03:25.500> of<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:25.950> early

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
there's the the incident of the early

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.300 
there's the the incident of the early
blight<00:03:26.459> goes<00:03:27.090> away<00:03:27.329> so<00:03:27.720> I<00:03:27.989> think<00:03:28.709> I<00:03:28.829> caught<00:03:29.130> it

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
blight goes away so I think I caught it

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.809 
blight goes away so I think I caught it
and<00:03:29.720> and<00:03:30.720> I<00:03:31.709> think<00:03:31.919> it's<00:03:32.069> just<00:03:32.280> kind<00:03:32.400> of<00:03:32.519> you

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
and and I think it's just kind of you

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:34.490 
and and I think it's just kind of you
know<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.239> damage<00:03:33.450> was<00:03:33.840> done<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:34.049> the<00:03:34.200> leaves

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
know the damage was done to the leaves

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.900 
know the damage was done to the leaves
already<00:03:34.829> and<00:03:35.190> that's<00:03:35.340> still<00:03:35.579> just<00:03:35.730> hanging

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
already and that's still just hanging

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.370 
already and that's still just hanging
around<00:03:36.060> but<00:03:36.389> it's<00:03:36.540> not<00:03:36.630> developing<00:03:37.290> any

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
around but it's not developing any

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.520 
around but it's not developing any
further<00:03:37.769> which<00:03:38.730> means<00:03:39.000> that<00:03:39.329> I<00:03:39.510> believe<00:03:40.019> we<00:03:40.230> we

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
further which means that I believe we we

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:41.870 
further which means that I believe we we
caught<00:03:40.799> this<00:03:40.980> early<00:03:41.220> blight<00:03:41.549> with<00:03:41.760> the

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
caught this early blight with the

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.240 
caught this early blight with the
compost<00:03:42.329> tea<00:03:42.599> in<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:42.900> and<00:03:43.109> the<00:03:43.739> microbes<00:03:44.130> in

the compost tea the bacteria and the and
the<00:03:47.160> fungi<00:03:47.549> were<00:03:47.730> able<00:03:48.030> to<00:03:48.060> out-compete<00:03:48.510> in

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
the fungi were able to out-compete in

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.140 
the fungi were able to out-compete in
the<00:03:49.590> root<00:03:49.769> zone

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
fungi of the early blight so that's

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.880

you<00:04:27.830> know<00:04:27.889> these<00:04:28.039> compost<00:04:28.610> tea<00:04:28.880> but<00:04:29.120> I'm<00:04:29.240> not

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
you know these compost tea but I'm not

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.820 
you know these compost tea but I'm not
using<00:04:29.539> the<00:04:29.690> compost<00:04:30.110> tea<00:04:30.289> from<00:04:30.470> the<00:04:30.590> stand

point<00:04:30.919> as<00:04:31.190> a<00:04:31.220> fertilizer<00:04:31.520> obviously<00:04:32.270> there<00:04:32.419> is

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
point as a fertilizer obviously there is

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.990 
point as a fertilizer obviously there is
some<00:04:32.800> nutrition<00:04:33.800> in<00:04:33.889> it<00:04:34.010> or<00:04:34.130> else<00:04:34.220> you

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
some nutrition in it or else you

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.219 
some nutrition in it or else you
wouldn't<00:04:35.210> give<00:04:35.360> the<00:04:35.510> difference<00:04:35.870> here<00:04:36.050> it's

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:36.229 
wouldn't give the difference here it's

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:39.540 
wouldn't give the difference here it's
also<00:04:36.410> an<00:04:36.800> interesting<00:04:37.100> thing<00:04:37.610> to<00:04:37.789> note<00:04:38.000> here

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
also an interesting thing to note here

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.340 
also an interesting thing to note here
there's<00:04:40.550> a<00:04:40.900> there's<00:04:41.900> something<00:04:41.960> called

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
there's a there's something called

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.770 
there's a there's something called
nutrient<00:04:42.919> cycling<00:04:43.400> nutrient<00:04:43.880> cycling<00:04:44.090> is

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
nutrient cycling nutrient cycling is

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.240 
nutrient cycling nutrient cycling is
when<00:04:45.050> the<00:04:45.169> soil<00:04:45.410> food<00:04:45.680> web<00:04:45.740> or<00:04:46.220> the

microorganisms that live in the soil if

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:49.930 
microorganisms that live in the soil if
the<00:04:48.350> soil<00:04:48.620> is<00:04:48.740> alive<00:04:48.889> and<00:04:49.250> healthy<00:04:49.400> like<00:04:49.699> it<00:04:49.850> is

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
the soil is alive and healthy like it is

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.510 
the soil is alive and healthy like it is
in<00:04:50.060> this<00:04:50.210> plant<00:04:50.680> they<00:04:51.680> can<00:04:52.039> generate

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
in this plant they can generate

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.850 
in this plant they can generate
nutrition<00:04:53.449> in<00:04:53.750> and<00:04:53.960> of<00:04:54.050> themselves<00:04:54.139> so<00:04:54.680> for

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
nutrition in and of themselves so for

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:00.310 
nutrition in and of themselves so for
example<00:04:55.280> I<00:04:55.490> put<00:04:56.950> it<00:04:57.950> was<00:04:58.160> a<00:04:59.080> bacteria<00:05:00.080> and<00:05:00.260> a

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
example I put it was a bacteria and a

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.080 
example I put it was a bacteria and a
fungal<00:05:00.710> tea<00:05:00.979> on<00:05:01.250> this<00:05:01.550> on<00:05:01.760> this<00:05:02.270> plant<00:05:02.570> and<00:05:04.090> so

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
fungal tea on this on this plant and so

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.089 
fungal tea on this on this plant and so
the<00:05:05.180> bacteria<00:05:05.660> are<00:05:05.810> generated<00:05:06.349> the<00:05:06.560> fungi<00:05:06.950> are

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:07.099 
the bacteria are generated the fungi are

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:10.089 
the bacteria are generated the fungi are
generated<00:05:07.610> I<00:05:08.000> put<00:05:08.270> them<00:05:08.450> in<00:05:08.599> there<00:05:09.099> but

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:10.099 
generated I put them in there but

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:12.370 
generated I put them in there but
there's<00:05:10.310> also<00:05:10.539> more<00:05:11.539> of<00:05:11.570> the<00:05:11.840> soil<00:05:12.110> food<00:05:12.320> web

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
there's also more of the soil food web

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.920 
there's also more of the soil food web
excuse<00:05:12.860> me<00:05:12.979> more<00:05:13.820> of<00:05:13.910> the<00:05:13.940> soil<00:05:14.240> food<00:05:14.450> web<00:05:14.510> in

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
excuse me more of the soil food web in

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.740 
excuse me more of the soil food web in
this<00:05:15.320> fungal<00:05:16.039> tea<00:05:16.190> or<00:05:16.370> in<00:05:16.490> the<00:05:16.610> in<00:05:16.849> the<00:05:17.030> compost

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
this fungal tea or in the in the compost

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.850 
this fungal tea or in the in the compost
tea<00:05:17.930> as<00:05:18.050> well<00:05:19.479> so<00:05:20.479> when<00:05:20.870> the<00:05:21.020> bacteria<00:05:21.229> get

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
tea as well so when the bacteria get

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.969 
tea as well so when the bacteria get
consumed<00:05:22.550> by<00:05:23.419> the<00:05:23.479> protozoa<00:05:23.990> that<00:05:24.470> are<00:05:24.560> in<00:05:24.740> the

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:13.820 
wanted to share I'm going to carry this

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.659 
wanted to share I'm going to carry this
out<00:06:13.969> a<00:06:14.030> little<00:06:14.300> bit<00:06:14.390> further<00:06:14.690> to<00:06:15.409> see<00:06:16.250> how<00:06:16.430> much

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:16.669 
out a little bit further to see how much

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:21.730 
out a little bit further to see how much
of<00:06:16.940> this<00:06:17.240> fruit<00:06:17.570> comes<00:06:17.960> to<00:06:18.820> ripen<00:06:19.820> I've<00:06:20.740> my

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:21.740 
of this fruit comes to ripen I've my

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.339 
of this fruit comes to ripen I've my
experiment<00:06:22.340> for<00:06:22.610> me<00:06:22.639> though<00:06:23.000> is<00:06:23.240> is<00:06:23.750> done<00:06:24.169> I

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:24.349 
experiment for me though is is done I

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:27.450 
experiment for me though is is done I
see<00:06:24.889> the<00:06:25.010> results<00:06:25.460> you<00:06:26.210> know<00:06:26.330> they're<00:06:26.750> obvious

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:27.460 
see the results you know they're obvious

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:30.480 
see the results you know they're obvious
this<00:06:28.460> is<00:06:28.610> not<00:06:28.789> the<00:06:28.909> best<00:06:29.090> climate<00:06:29.539> for<00:06:29.719> growing

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490 
this is not the best climate for growing

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.010 
this is not the best climate for growing
tomatoes<00:06:31.490> so<00:06:31.969> I<00:06:32.000> don't<00:06:32.240> really<00:06:32.450> expect<00:06:32.810> this

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:33.020 
tomatoes so I don't really expect this

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.379 
tomatoes so I don't really expect this
to<00:06:33.229> go<00:06:33.409> you<00:06:33.680> know<00:06:34.280> into<00:06:34.639> a<00:06:34.669> tremendously

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:35.389 
to go you know into a tremendously

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:38.950 
to go you know into a tremendously
prolific<00:06:36.349> plant<00:06:37.360> perhaps<00:06:38.360> the<00:06:38.510> next<00:06:38.659> time<00:06:38.930> I

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 
prolific plant perhaps the next time I

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.529 
prolific plant perhaps the next time I
run<00:06:39.260> up<00:06:39.440> a<00:06:39.620> comparison<00:06:40.430> like<00:06:40.580> this<00:06:40.789> I'll<00:06:41.300> use

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:41.539 
run up a comparison like this I'll use

00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:43.330 
run up a comparison like this I'll use
some<00:06:41.750> real<00:06:41.900> quality<00:06:42.139> soil<00:06:42.590> rather<00:06:42.889> than<00:06:43.099> this

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:43.340 
some real quality soil rather than this

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.270 
some real quality soil rather than this
wiped<00:06:43.580> out<00:06:43.789> slow<00:06:44.060> that<00:06:44.270> I<00:06:44.360> used<00:06:44.919> so<00:06:45.919> thanks<00:06:46.159> for

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:46.280 
wiped out slow that I used so thanks for

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.860 
wiped out slow that I used so thanks for
