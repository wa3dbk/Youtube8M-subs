00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.360
 in the world society for animal protection don luis cepeda 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.970
 rejects bluntly the fact another attack was presented yesterday 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.059
 in the metropolitan stadium of Barranquilla 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:12.799
 as soon as this is a soccer player 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:15.340
 d the athletic but she 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.220
 hit 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.060
 to take to the field of play 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.529
 when technically palm the reason that it was 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.099
 By Lose Your Little Daughters 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.330
 to the world many reasons there are many means forgiveness 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.859
 and before which could have removed in addition to the court 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.870
 then under no circumstance percent is this fact tolerated 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.090
 remains 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.910
 this fat football has been committed 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.780
 in Colombia the chef artists in particular the footballers 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.620
 are seen as examples to follow is as prominent figures as figures 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.900
 that we want percent 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.780
 that we want to follow his example 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.380
 so it's very sad that one of his players 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.210
 give us this example and cult and intolerance 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.280
 not only for soccer fans 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.790
 not only for those who attended the stadium 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.230
 not only for those who watched the session the sports section 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.750
 for the community in general 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.950
 because under no point of view 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.289
 we can accept that this person has mistreated 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:17.289
 They are made in this way 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.060
 beyond an apology to the animal protection society 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.310
 percent I think that 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.800
 efe 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.390
 you should go one step further 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.710
 and show with facts with examples 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:30.810
 percent e 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.750
 for example create a more active way in the protection of animals 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.479
 we are we who have apologies 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.750
 is the fauna is that the ecosystem 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.170
 why 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.240
 l the one affected in this case 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.470
 is an owl that is recovering in a clinic in Barranquilla then 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.360
 I think it is beyond the sanction as I said for examples 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.030
 a more active involvement in the subject animals 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.230
 and show those facts to soccer fans and those 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:00.450
 people that take 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.430
 that are not followers because they saw this case 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:04.600
 p like 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.230
 in our athletes 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.230
 They certainly protect the Serbs 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.249
 this situation that presents itself with the owl abuse in the stadium is of 

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:16.059
 barranquilla 

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:20.069
 according to e certainly other acts of cruelty mold that have been 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.709
 come presenting 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.339
 percent and we took days in the last weeks here in colombia 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.159
 I think that is the opportune moment when we see that there is one's own 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:34.049
 community efe strongly rejects these acts 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.989
 we know that the commune does not agree with this type of 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.829
 mistreatment n the Colombian wants the animals then it is a call for 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:43.029
 will burst 

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:47.019
 In addition, educational programs and awareness raising 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:48.209
 community in general 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.069
 but in particular to those people who in one way or another are our books 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.389
 the stars are admired by children 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:57.309
 as only sportsman footballers 

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:58.920
 ii in this way 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.999
 start to finish with this 

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:05.049
 percent with these with these acts of cruelty the country is also important 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:10.279
 emphasize that a person who mistreats animals per cent is an abuser of 

00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:12.169
 potential people 

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:15.719
 this is a call to the athletic pereira and anahÃ­ mayor 

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:20.929
 to sanction in an exemplary way the player who caused the abuse 

00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:22.659
 to the owl percent 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:24.970
 Unfortunately, the law is very weak 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.870
 and we do not give ourselves the tools to be able to act in a severe way against the 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.669
 football player for this reason we expect carlos e a penalty 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:37.779
 exemplary and what percent the player has been forced 

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:42.209
 or show his repentance and he knows his fault 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.069
 as for seat some kind of social action 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:46.999
 for the benefit of animals 

00:03:46.999 --> 00:03:50.409
 percent this will see us a clear indication 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:53.430
 pique not only footballers and not sports in general 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.570
 and sports authorities are committed to a country the best with 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.209
 a more ethical country and of course 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:04.479
 was to support and protect the animals that is what at that time 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.710
 we are percent
