00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
recognizing that animals play a very

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.030 
recognizing that animals play a very

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
significant role in our lives at the

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.789 
significant role in our lives at the
same<00:01:26.220> time<00:01:26.580> courts<00:01:27.540> are<00:01:27.689> really<00:01:27.990> constricted

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
same time courts are really constricted

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.240 
same time courts are really constricted
by<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.009> fact<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.930> pets<00:01:30.930> are<00:01:31.170> classified<00:01:32.009> as

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
by the fact that pets are classified as

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.670 
by the fact that pets are classified as
personal<00:01:32.700> property<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:33.930> this<00:01:34.140> comes<00:01:34.439> up

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
personal property and so this comes up

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.630 
personal property and so this comes up
in<00:01:34.920> custody<00:01:36.110> disputes<00:01:37.110> where<00:01:37.530> they<00:01:38.070> tend<00:01:38.490> to

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
in custody disputes where they tend to

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.480 
in custody disputes where they tend to
be<00:01:38.850> distributed<00:01:39.540> like<00:01:39.780> any<00:01:40.079> other<00:01:40.490> property

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490

comes up in other issues where damages

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.679 
comes up in other issues where damages
issues<00:01:47.340> come<00:01:47.579> up<00:01:47.700> if<00:01:47.909> an<00:01:48.060> animal's<00:01:48.479> been

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
issues come up if an animal's been

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.940 
issues come up if an animal's been

harmed or haven't been killed and courts

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.710 
harmed or haven't been killed and courts
are<00:01:53.070> trying<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.460> determine<00:01:53.850> what<00:01:54.329> amount<00:01:54.659> of

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
are trying to determine what amount of

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.050 
are trying to determine what amount of
value<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.350> place<00:01:55.590> on<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:55.979> animal<00:01:56.430> they're

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
value to place on that animal they're

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.840 
value to place on that animal they're
technically<00:01:57.689> restricted<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.680> market<00:01:59.430> value

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
technically restricted to market value

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.850 
technically restricted to market value
but<00:02:00.479> obviously<00:02:00.990> there's<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.500> level<00:02:01.710> of

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
but obviously there's a level of

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.480 
but obviously there's a level of
companionship<00:02:02.520> that<00:02:03.079> goes<00:02:04.079> far<00:02:04.409> beyond<00:02:04.799> the

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
companionship that goes far beyond the

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.760 
companionship that goes far beyond the
market<00:02:05.850> value<00:02:06.180> of<00:02:06.210> an

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
market value of an

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.650 
market value of an
and<00:02:07.009> I<00:02:07.509> would<00:02:08.509> say<00:02:09.020> all<00:02:09.259> cases<00:02:09.800> so<00:02:10.550> it's<00:02:11.330> slowly

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
and I would say all cases so it's slowly

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.990 
and I would say all cases so it's slowly
evolving<00:02:12.380> where<00:02:12.709> courts<00:02:13.160> are<00:02:13.280> finding<00:02:13.790> ways

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
evolving where courts are finding ways

in the event that a relationship does go
south<00:03:28.730> what<00:03:29.090> will<00:03:29.209> happen<00:03:29.570> to<00:03:29.690> the<00:03:29.780> animals

that's<00:03:30.590> one<00:03:30.920> option<00:03:31.430> to<00:03:31.700> avoid<00:03:32.570> litigation

that's one option to avoid litigation

that's one option to avoid litigation
another<00:03:34.250> is<00:03:34.579> once<00:03:35.269> a<00:03:35.450> dispute<00:03:35.870> arises

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
versus the other but some courts will

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.610 
versus the other but some courts will
get<00:04:23.190> involved<00:04:23.700> and<00:04:23.970> consider<00:04:24.690> the<00:04:25.230> best

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
get involved and consider the best

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.430 
get involved and consider the best
interest<00:04:26.040> of<00:04:26.160> the<00:04:26.280> animal<00:04:26.990> where<00:04:27.990> the<00:04:28.110> animals

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
interest of the animal where the animals

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.440 
interest of the animal where the animals
going<00:04:28.590> to<00:04:28.680> be<00:04:28.770> happiest<00:04:29.310> where<00:04:29.880> it's<00:04:30.000> going<00:04:30.330> to

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
going to be happiest where it's going to

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.150 
going to be happiest where it's going to
live<00:04:30.660> out<00:04:30.780> its<00:04:30.960> life<00:04:31.170> in<00:04:31.380> the<00:04:31.410> best<00:04:31.650> conditions

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
live out its life in the best conditions

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.630 
live out its life in the best conditions
and<00:04:32.520> so<00:04:33.210> it's<00:04:33.450> really<00:04:33.660> just<00:04:33.810> a<00:04:34.290> matter<00:04:34.530> of<00:04:34.650> the

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
and so it's really just a matter of the

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.640 
and so it's really just a matter of the
particular<00:04:36.150> judge<00:04:36.390> the<00:04:36.750> particular<00:04:37.290> court

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
particular judge the particular court

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.550 
particular judge the particular court
and<00:04:37.980> again<00:04:38.340> this<00:04:38.550> is<00:04:38.790> something<00:04:39.030> that's

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
and again this is something that's

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.780 
and again this is something that's
hopefully<00:04:40.560> headed<00:04:41.370> in<00:04:41.490> the<00:04:41.610> right<00:04:41.730> direction

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
hopefully headed in the right direction

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.600 
hopefully headed in the right direction
as<00:04:42.540> animals<00:04:43.140> become<00:04:43.500> a<00:04:43.530> more<00:04:43.860> prominent<00:04:44.340> part

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
as animals become a more prominent part

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.010 
as animals become a more prominent part
of<00:04:44.670> society<00:04:45.030> and<00:04:45.240> a<00:04:45.420> court<00:04:45.630> start<00:04:45.900> to

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
of society and a court start to

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.670 
of society and a court start to
recognize<00:04:46.500> that<00:04:47.480> given<00:04:48.480> that<00:04:48.510> animals<00:04:49.350> are

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
recognize that given that animals are

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.830 
recognize that given that animals are
technically<00:04:50.580> personal<00:04:51.090> property<00:04:51.540> still

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
technically personal property still

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.800 
technically personal property still
whether<00:04:52.080> we<00:04:52.260> like<00:04:52.470> that<00:04:52.680> or<00:04:52.860> not<00:04:53.360> an<00:04:54.360> issue

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
that comes up whether you're dealing

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.000 
that comes up whether you're dealing
with<00:04:56.520> negotiating<00:04:57.510> an<00:04:57.600> informal<00:04:58.170> agreement

rescue group sometimes those documents

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:25.370 
rescue group sometimes those documents
will<00:06:24.330> stay<00:06:24.690> and<00:06:25.110> then

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:25.380 
will stay and then
