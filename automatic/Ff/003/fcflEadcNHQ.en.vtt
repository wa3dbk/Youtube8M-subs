with all their doubles or linkers and

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.870 
with all their doubles or linkers and
then<00:01:14.440> you<00:01:14.500> do<00:01:14.590> a<00:01:14.619> combo<00:01:14.950> finisher<00:01:15.070> to<00:01:15.490> cash<00:01:15.670> in

then you do a combo finisher to cash in
your<00:01:16.030> damage<00:01:16.360> and<00:01:16.630> once<00:01:17.470> you<00:01:17.590> understand<00:01:18.070> that

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
and then you start learning the moves

as<00:01:31.509> a<00:01:31.539> game<00:01:31.750> that<00:01:31.960> is<00:01:32.259> easy<00:01:32.740> to<00:01:32.830> pick<00:01:33.009> up<00:01:33.159> but

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
as a game that is easy to pick up but

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.859 
as a game that is easy to pick up but
it's<00:01:33.520> super<00:01:33.700> deep<00:01:34.000> once<00:01:34.270> you've<00:01:34.420> played<00:01:34.630> for<00:01:34.659> a

was<00:03:40.670> actually<00:03:41.030> already<00:03:41.510> getting<00:03:41.930> beat<00:03:42.080> up

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
was actually already getting beat up

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.820 
was actually already getting beat up
like<00:03:43.700> so<00:03:43.970> now<00:03:44.810> the<00:03:44.870> trick<00:03:45.170> is<00:03:45.200> it<00:03:45.500> becomes<00:03:45.740> a

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
like so now the trick is it becomes a

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.620 
like so now the trick is it becomes a
mind<00:03:46.040> game<00:03:46.130> is<00:03:46.640> the<00:03:46.850> guy<00:03:47.000> going<00:03:47.150> to<00:03:47.270> try<00:03:47.420> and<00:03:47.450> do

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
mind game is the guy going to try and do

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.480 
mind game is the guy going to try and do
a<00:03:47.660> combo<00:03:47.990> breaker<00:03:48.140> here<00:03:48.560> it<00:03:48.980> could<00:03:49.130> be<00:03:49.250> dozens

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 
a combo breaker here it could be dozens

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.880 
a combo breaker here it could be dozens
and<00:03:49.940> Campbell<00:03:50.900> for<00:03:51.080> example<00:03:51.500> tries<00:03:51.710> to

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
and Campbell for example tries to

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.550 
and Campbell for example tries to
celebrate<00:03:52.460> our<00:03:53.050> torrent<00:03:54.050> ride<00:03:54.200> again<00:03:54.410> go

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
celebrate our torrent ride again go

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.020 
celebrate our torrent ride again go
ahead<00:03:54.710> and<00:03:54.800> do<00:03:54.860> a<00:03:54.890> combo<00:03:55.220> breaker<00:03:55.370> or<00:03:55.790> sorry

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
ahead and do a combo breaker or sorry

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.150 
ahead and do a combo breaker or sorry
yeah<00:03:56.750> you<00:03:56.810> start<00:03:57.380> the<00:03:57.470> combo<00:03:57.740> and<00:03:57.860> then<00:03:57.980> just

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
yeah you start the combo and then just

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.450 
yeah you start the combo and then just
try<00:03:58.310> and<00:03:58.370> counter<00:03:58.730> with<00:03:58.880> torn<00:03:59.090> doing<00:03:59.330> nothing

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:00.460 
try and counter with torn doing nothing

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.830 
try and counter with torn doing nothing
so<00:04:01.460> he<00:04:01.580> basically<00:04:01.700> dropped<00:04:02.210> the<00:04:02.420> combo<00:04:02.720> that

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
so he basically dropped the combo that

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.110 
so he basically dropped the combo that
was<00:04:02.990> Jean<00:04:03.350> that<00:04:03.950> was<00:04:04.130> Campbell<00:04:04.550> trying<00:04:05.030> to

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
was Jean that was Campbell trying to

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.030 
was Jean that was Campbell trying to
parry<00:04:05.390> his<00:04:05.660> counter<00:04:05.960> breaker<00:04:06.170> so<00:04:06.770> it<00:04:06.890> has<00:04:07.010> a

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
parry his counter breaker so it has a

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.910 
parry his counter breaker so it has a
depth<00:04:07.700> to<00:04:08.630> the<00:04:08.720> combo<00:04:08.990> breaker<00:04:09.110> system<00:04:09.590> sort

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
depth to the combo breaker system sort

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.100 
depth to the combo breaker system sort
of<00:04:10.010> a<00:04:10.100> yummy<00:04:10.340> like<00:04:10.490> system<00:04:10.880> into<00:04:11.750> something

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
of a yummy like system into something

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.630 
of a yummy like system into something
that<00:04:12.230> used<00:04:12.410> to<00:04:12.530> be<00:04:12.680> I'm<00:04:13.010> getting<00:04:13.250> my<00:04:13.490> butt

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
that used to be I'm getting my butt

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.060 
that used to be I'm getting my butt
kicked<00:04:13.670> and<00:04:14.030> maybe<00:04:14.180> I<00:04:14.270> can<00:04:14.510> combo<00:04:14.780> break<00:04:15.070> so

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
kicked and maybe I can combo break so

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.190 
kicked and maybe I can combo break so
now<00:04:16.220> you<00:04:16.280> add<00:04:16.640> to<00:04:16.760> that<00:04:16.790> do<00:04:17.120> the<00:04:17.380> shadow<00:04:18.380> come

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
now you add to that do the shadow come

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.050 
now you add to that do the shadow come
so<00:04:21.200> shadow<00:04:21.530> common<00:04:21.920> is<00:04:22.040> a<00:04:22.070> move<00:04:22.280> where<00:04:22.580> you

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
so shadow common is a move where you

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.490 
so shadow common is a move where you
spend<00:04:23.360> the<00:04:23.480> shadow<00:04:23.690> meters<00:04:24.050> on<00:04:24.169> the<00:04:24.200> bottom

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
spend the shadow meters on the bottom

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.670 
spend the shadow meters on the bottom
it's<00:04:24.620> kind<00:04:24.770> of<00:04:24.800> like<00:04:24.890> y<00:04:25.100> x<00:04:26.200> it's<00:04:27.200> just<00:04:27.530> the

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
it's kind of like y x it's just the

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.820 
it's kind of like y x it's just the
Spanish<00:04:28.070> Peter<00:04:28.250> down<00:04:28.870> so<00:04:29.870> the<00:04:29.990> idea<00:04:30.110> is<00:04:30.350> if

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
Spanish Peter down so the idea is if

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.050 
Spanish Peter down so the idea is if
someone's<00:04:31.160> got<00:04:31.340> a<00:04:31.370> bunch<00:04:31.580> of<00:04:31.640> meter<00:04:31.850> and

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
someone's got a bunch of meter and

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.279 
someone's got a bunch of meter and
they're<00:04:32.150> trying<00:04:32.360> to<00:04:32.390> hit<00:04:32.570> you<00:04:32.660> with<00:04:32.690> a<00:04:32.840> kid

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:33.289 
they're trying to hit you with a kid

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:36.650 
they're trying to hit you with a kid
opener<00:04:34.289> at<00:04:34.500> the<00:04:34.919> right<00:04:35.220> time<00:04:35.520> you<00:04:36.210> can<00:04:36.240> do<00:04:36.630> a

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
opener at the right time you can do a

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.230 
opener at the right time you can do a
counter<00:04:37.169> to<00:04:37.350> basically<00:04:37.800> turn<00:04:38.310> that<00:04:38.819> opener

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
counter to basically turn that opener

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.850 
counter to basically turn that opener
they're<00:04:39.660> building<00:04:39.990> meter<00:04:40.169> now<00:04:40.380> so<00:04:40.680> go<00:04:40.770> ahead

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
they're building meter now so go ahead

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.420 
they're building meter now so go ahead
and<00:04:40.979> do<00:04:41.160> it<00:04:41.250> again<00:04:41.310> that<00:04:42.300> was<00:04:42.479> the<00:04:42.599> move<00:04:43.430> but

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
and do it again that was the move but

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.779 
and do it again that was the move but
you<00:04:44.460> need<00:04:44.550> to<00:04:44.759> do<00:04:44.880> it<00:04:45.680> as<00:04:46.680> always<00:04:47.190> demoing<00:04:47.550> is

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:47.789 
you need to do it as always demoing is

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:49.249 
you need to do it as always demoing is
so<00:04:47.940> much<00:04:48.090> harder<00:04:48.240> than<00:04:48.360> just<00:04:48.630> doing<00:04:48.780> you

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:49.259 
so much harder than just doing you

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:51.439 
so much harder than just doing you
should<00:04:49.410> just<00:04:49.620> fight<00:04:49.860> fight<00:04:50.729> and<00:04:50.970> I<00:04:51.090> bet<00:04:51.330> we

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:51.449 
should just fight fight and I bet we

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:53.420 
should just fight fight and I bet we
will<00:04:51.539> see<00:04:51.599> there's<00:04:52.020> one<00:04:52.199> right<00:04:52.380> there<00:04:52.440> so<00:04:53.280> he

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
will see there's one right there so he

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.409 
will see there's one right there so he
basically<00:04:53.870> countered<00:04:55.880> jorn<00:04:56.880> came<00:04:57.150> in<00:04:57.300> with

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 
basically countered jorn came in with

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:00.559 
basically countered jorn came in with
pressure<00:04:58.880> Campbell<00:04:59.880> did<00:05:00.000> the<00:05:00.120> counter<00:05:00.419> move

00:05:00.559 --> 00:05:00.569 
pressure Campbell did the counter move

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:02.480 
pressure Campbell did the counter move
on<00:05:00.750> it<00:05:00.900> which<00:05:01.020> spends<00:05:01.289> in<00:05:01.470> the<00:05:01.560> X<00:05:01.710> Peter<00:05:02.009> it

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
on it which spends in the X Peter it

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.400 
on it which spends in the X Peter it
basically<00:05:02.759> carries<00:05:03.330> any<00:05:03.660> multi-hit<00:05:04.169> move

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
basically carries any multi-hit move

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.499 
basically carries any multi-hit move
that<00:05:04.590> comes<00:05:04.770> in<00:05:04.979> let<00:05:05.580> that<00:05:05.729> period<00:05:06.180> in<00:05:06.330> you

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:06.509 
that comes in let that period in you

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:08.480 
that comes in let that period in you
need<00:05:06.660> to<00:05:06.750> have<00:05:06.900> another<00:05:07.020> hit<00:05:07.380> coming<00:05:07.680> after<00:05:08.400> it

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
need to have another hit coming after it

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.909 
need to have another hit coming after it
either<00:05:08.639> buffer<00:05:09.120> or<00:05:09.330> like<00:05:09.810> a<00:05:09.840> 580<00:05:10.320> ex<00:05:10.530> like
