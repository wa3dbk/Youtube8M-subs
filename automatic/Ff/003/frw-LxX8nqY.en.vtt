is<00:04:56.870> an<00:04:57.080> STM<00:04:57.620> one<00:04:57.860> since<00:04:58.340> I<00:04:58.669> have<00:04:59.389> to<00:04:59.629> actually

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
is an STM one since I have to actually

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:06.520 
is an STM one since I have to actually
glue<00:05:00.560> that<00:05:00.889> act<00:05:01.340> together<00:05:04.180> but<00:05:05.530> nevertheless

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:11.539 
as you can tell it was back in the day

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:15.289 
when I review these 0 chroma case I like

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:17.350 
when I review these 0 chroma case I like
the<00:05:15.440> thin<00:05:15.650> case<00:05:15.919> because<00:05:16.250> it<00:05:16.280> works<00:05:16.580> with<00:05:16.849> this

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
the thin case because it works with this
