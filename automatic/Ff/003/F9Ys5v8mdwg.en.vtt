 you talked fear us each 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:18.289
 it would be interesting to look into the holy 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.289
 saints instead it's on it right on her 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:24.370

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.589

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.719
 these 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:01:03.030
 but court preference gives 4-inch 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.030
 almost exactly the same 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:14.590

 Spring 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:30.610
 lemongrass works well but not always 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.610
 need to know when 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.030

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:44.640
 nacre 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:47.150
 who lay down with lemons and 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.150
 I cried from you 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.150

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.659
 mother of pearl with red tail 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:03.870

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:09.670
 twist is taken red cuts off the tail 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:14.400
 this year's rows are changing quite well 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.400
 Sudak recommended here such faster 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:27.290
 in the fall slaves begin to work well and 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.290
 long brushes 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.860

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:44.109
 Lyonka calf 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:44.109
 I also eat ovsky but it was not fashionable to be sick 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:51.849
 by zander also work well 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:54.720
 mother of pearl with a red head and just 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.720
 clean feed 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:05.140
 on the perch 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:10.660
 3 inch green can wagon 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:13.380

 light green with darker dots 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.400
 also on concrete 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:36.239
 and here is one of the most 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.239
 it said generally kill perch and pike perch 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:45.230
 it is almost equal to higher but its experience 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.860
 never miss 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:51.220
 That's exactly the kind of crystals I caught 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.220
 the largest 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:05.489
 still mr and for ear nigrol 

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:08.750

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.750
 green dots 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.510
 beautiful perch caught but smaller 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:25.070
 it is also not played on a smaller 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:29.800
 may be the smallest range series 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:31.220
 on this one and it becomes generally all perch 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:36.940
 roach 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.940
