00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
need that charge but I think it's kind

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.010 
need that charge but I think it's kind
of<00:01:20.280> cool<00:01:20.430> at<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:21.150> end<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.450> day<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.780> fact

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
of cool at the end of the day the fact

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.600 
of cool at the end of the day the fact
that<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.500> can<00:01:22.680> just<00:01:22.890> put<00:01:23.009> this<00:01:23.159> beside<00:01:23.460> your
