00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.450
 Today is a professional and snow channel 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.450
 Good today 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.170
 Among the plant 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:16.430
 I love you a little unique personality 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:20.270
 As a little interior green this 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:22.650
 In a glass bowl to enjoy 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.880
 With the seramis 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.750
 I think that I want to be implanted 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.970
 First of all 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.970
 The other entered the glass jar but I'd say anything 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:41.600
 What 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:42.970
 Today it is not io degree, but widely used as hydroponic soil 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.660
 It is cellar water 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.660
 Something like this 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.780
 I think that I want to implant it using what I 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.440
 First of all 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.670
 The number during the tour 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.149
 It is about 1/3 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.149
 It is a generation 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.080
 Is it feeling like 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.940
 But in it just passed through the Chan to put on the other hind leg 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:23.990
 I went also and got a little indeed with soil laden 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:27.850
 It is either a tomb that has spread Kono under so unsightly and soil've seen 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:30.050
 A little bit of a cat that's pretty solid here 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.450
 Clean up 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.310
 Stock 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.720
 A little 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.750
 Compact Lee 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.750
 You can do it with one work 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.230
 Haulcia's cat is pretty fat here 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.080
 To synthesis 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:54.659
 It is one of the plants that bears value 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:57.840
 A wide spread like you have grown too much 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.100
 A little or a monkey or something 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.880
 It is also possible to cut it down 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:07.310
 Will come out soon 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.310
 A little to the cat of processing in these felt 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.569
 The whole department is 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.770
 Oh 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.640
 As in the present 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.280
 This pactor 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.460
 I think it was not 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.000
 In this condition 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.000
 Before 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.050
 I'm going through it like this on top of the seramis 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:36.310
 So this time 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:39.150
 There is something I can do here, but I will plant a tag so that I can enjoy some plants through the glass 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.310
 Slightly lower than the depth 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.330
 It is around here 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.760
 As a little point this time is to say the plant to include 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.260
 When is bald 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.400
 Because 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.659
 Actually that 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.780
 Well I have half a bit of serum in it, but I stopped at this much and I'm here 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:57.920
 Pon and 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.800
 We through the seedlings 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.590
 And 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.810
 After the place where there is a gap 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.250
 Husband I am the seller away 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.250
 I'm going to charge the rubber 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:34.799
 It will be fixed to some extent if there is a mistake in it 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:47.159
 Says the Seramisu pouring a little is okay is opposition even if you release your hand When you come up there 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:47.159
 I am accustomed to using thin 4 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:01.770
 I also treated the cat just like this, so I can see the cat from the side and see the soil 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:07.280
 Not so beautifully 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:07.280
 I think it looks good I think it looks good even when mixed 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.150
 What 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:16.389
 Using this kind of tweezers or a sailor mistakes that had entered the little leaves gaps 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.169
 If you remove it 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.169
 Commander 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.700
 Such a form 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.700
 eh 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:34.660
 Is this ready ? 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:37.280
 Kedomo it's way of day-to-day management 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.729
 A place like a light day 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.870
 Replacement and bay window 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:43.849
 A place that is bright even among popular 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:50.510
 If you manage 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:55.760
 Even though after so much your water because it is a kind of blue Luzia succulents is do not require 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:59.230
 After all if there is some wrinkles, it is a sign that there is no water, so yes 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.230
 If sign came out 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:07.430
 I'm pouring the water and the water to the area where the plant is just right. 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:12.140
 The 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:20.720
 5 minutes 10 minutes I let this seramis suck water 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:21.410
 Each grain has a role to absorb the water, so it takes about 5 minutes and the necessary water 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.830
 All 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:27.660
 Seramis will absorb 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:30.639
 Then 5 minutes and 10 minutes passed and the remaining water 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.200
 Slightly diagonal 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:36.639
 Get open 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:40.900
 Is it safe to the extent that all may not be fully under remains that some 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:44.910
 I think that if it is possible to spear your water in such a form 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:46.880
 Since Seramisu absolutely no fertilizer worth about once a month 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.139
 Fertilizer content in liquid fertilizer 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.529
 And I'll do 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:53.000
 It's a long time in a pretty state 

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:55.009
 like this 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.460
 It became height 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:06:02.430
 I think I can not enjoy it 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:02.430
 Please try it by all means!
