last<00:03:06.580> time<00:03:06.730> it<00:03:07.000> was<00:03:07.120> kind<00:03:07.420> of<00:03:07.590> pretty<00:03:08.590> chaotic

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
last time it was kind of pretty chaotic

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.350 
last time it was kind of pretty chaotic
what<00:03:09.340> was<00:03:09.459> the<00:03:09.580> over<00:03:09.790> there<00:03:09.910> doing<00:03:10.060> on<00:03:10.239> their

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
what was the over there doing on their

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.330 
what was the over there doing on their
live<00:03:10.510> stream<00:03:10.810> nobody<00:03:11.560> was<00:03:11.680> really<00:03:11.769> talking<00:03:11.890> it

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
live stream nobody was really talking it

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.620 
live stream nobody was really talking it
was<00:03:12.430> just<00:03:12.550> gameplay<00:03:12.940> maybe<00:03:13.209> they<00:03:13.360> do<00:03:13.510> it

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
was just gameplay maybe they do it

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.970 
was just gameplay maybe they do it
better<00:03:13.720> this<00:03:13.930> time<00:03:13.989> but<00:03:14.590> I<00:03:14.650> think<00:03:14.860> it'd<00:03:14.950> be

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
better this time but I think it'd be

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.650 
better this time but I think it'd be
really<00:03:15.250> cool<00:03:15.519> if<00:03:15.640> we<00:03:15.700> got<00:03:15.940> to<00:03:16.090> out<00:03:16.209> you<00:03:16.390> know<00:03:16.510> go
