00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
don't see much of a difference between

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.470 
don't see much of a difference between
this<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.410> what<00:00:28.640> I've<00:00:29.640> seen<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.849> lease<00:00:30.060> is<00:00:30.269> put

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
this and what I've seen a lease is put

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.040 
this and what I've seen a lease is put
out<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:31.050> ddrum<00:00:31.710> put<00:00:31.920> out<00:00:32.180> or<00:00:33.180> even<00:00:33.329> Roland<00:00:33.870> put

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
out and ddrum put out or even Roland put

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.680 
out and ddrum put out or even Roland put
out<00:00:34.200> on<00:00:34.410> some<00:00:34.590> of<00:00:34.620> their<00:00:34.829> lesser<00:00:35.270> models<00:00:36.270> so<00:00:36.660> I

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
out on some of their lesser models so I

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.180 
out on some of their lesser models so I
think<00:00:36.809> for<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.200> money<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.559> got<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.710> great<00:00:37.950> deal

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
think for the money you got a great deal

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.350 
think for the money you got a great deal
here<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:39.120> got<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.300> bass<00:00:39.540> drum<00:00:40.399> hi-hat<00:00:41.399> the

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
you ten different preset sounds this

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.639 
you ten different preset sounds this
one's<00:00:53.760> just<00:00:53.820> my<00:00:54.780> favorite<00:00:55.170> one<00:00:55.320> because<00:00:55.410> it's

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
one's just my favorite one because it's

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.650 
one's just my favorite one because it's
more<00:00:55.800> like<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:55.949> real<00:00:56.190> drum<00:00:56.430> set<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:57.090> frame<00:00:57.449> is

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
more like a real drum set the frame is

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.810 
more like a real drum set the frame is
actually<00:00:58.079> pretty<00:00:58.649> much<00:00:58.739> exactly<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.370> same<00:00:59.460> as

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
actually pretty much exactly the same as

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.770 
actually pretty much exactly the same as
any<00:00:59.940> other<00:01:00.440> major<00:01:01.440> brand<00:01:02.059> like<00:01:03.059> Yamaha<00:01:03.570> or

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
any other major brand like Yamaha or

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.830 
any other major brand like Yamaha or
roland<00:01:04.290> or<00:01:04.700> Lisa<00:01:05.700> so<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.090> think<00:01:06.390> you're<00:01:06.540> getting

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
roland or Lisa so I think you're getting

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.899 
roland or Lisa so I think you're getting
pretty<00:01:07.409> much<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.860> same<00:01:08.070> thing<00:01:08.430> for<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.729> lot

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
pretty much the same thing for a lot

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.060 
pretty much the same thing for a lot
less<00:01:09.119> money<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:10.380> I'm<00:01:10.560> going<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.740> play<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.890> little

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
less money so I'm going to play a little

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.500 
less money so I'm going to play a little
bit<00:01:11.280> on<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.549> show<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:11.909> this<00:01:12.090> actually<00:01:12.479> a

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
bit on it show you this actually a

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:55.809 
bit on it show you this actually a
bonafide<00:01:13.439> real<00:01:13.860> drum<00:01:14.100> set<00:01:14.310> here

00:01:55.809 --> 00:01:55.819 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:57.279 

the<00:01:56.090> one<00:01:56.270> thing<00:01:56.450> that<00:01:56.600> I<00:01:56.659> noticed<00:01:56.990> that<00:01:57.140> is

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
the one thing that I noticed that is

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:00.460 
the one thing that I noticed that is
probably<00:01:57.830> more<00:01:58.130> different<00:01:59.049> than<00:02:00.049> any<00:02:00.259> other

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
probably more different than any other

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.249 
probably more different than any other
issue<00:02:00.679> with<00:02:01.429> other<00:02:01.610> similar<00:02:01.939> kids<00:02:02.330> is<00:02:02.569> the

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
issue with other similar kids is the

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:05.830 
issue with other similar kids is the
pedal<00:02:03.709> actually<00:02:04.700> doesn't<00:02:05.030> have<00:02:05.149> a<00:02:05.209> it's<00:02:05.630> not<00:02:05.810> a

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
pedal actually doesn't have a it's not a

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.680 
pedal actually doesn't have a it's not a
bass<00:02:06.110> drum<00:02:06.140> pedal<00:02:06.770> that<00:02:07.069> hits<00:02:07.280> a<00:02:07.429> pad<00:02:07.759> with<00:02:08.149> a

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
bass drum pedal that hits a pad with a

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.600 
bass drum pedal that hits a pad with a
beater<00:02:08.989> it's<00:02:09.619> actually<00:02:10.009> just<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:10.369> same

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
beater it's actually just the same

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.580 
beater it's actually just the same
switch<00:02:11.060> that<00:02:11.330> you<00:02:11.450> have<00:02:11.599> for<00:02:11.810> the<00:02:11.870> hi-hat<00:02:12.260> but

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
switch that you have for the hi-hat but

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.210 
switch that you have for the hi-hat but
I<00:02:13.160> actually<00:02:13.340> kind<00:02:13.640> of<00:02:13.700> dig<00:02:13.940> that<00:02:14.950> it<00:02:15.950> doesn't

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
I actually kind of dig that it doesn't

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.650 
I actually kind of dig that it doesn't
really<00:02:16.310> feel<00:02:16.580> any<00:02:16.760> different<00:02:17.180> I<00:02:17.239> still<00:02:17.269> feel

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
really feel any different I still feel

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.630 
really feel any different I still feel
like<00:02:17.690> I'm<00:02:17.959> hitting<00:02:18.110> something<00:02:18.440> and<00:02:18.769> the<00:02:19.430> part

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
like I'm hitting something and the part

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.520 
like I'm hitting something and the part
that<00:02:19.670> I<00:02:19.819> dig<00:02:20.060> about<00:02:20.209> it<00:02:20.360> is<00:02:20.660> when<00:02:21.260> you<00:02:21.290> have

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
that I dig about it is when you have

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.740 
that I dig about it is when you have
those<00:02:21.709> pads<00:02:22.299> and<00:02:23.299> you're<00:02:23.420> hitting<00:02:23.540> it

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
those pads and you're hitting it

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.120 
those pads and you're hitting it
constantly<00:02:24.260> with<00:02:24.380> a<00:02:24.470> beater<00:02:24.680> it<00:02:24.980> can

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
constantly with a beater it can

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.160 
constantly with a beater it can
sometimes<00:02:25.340> mess<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.299> trigger<00:02:26.540> up<00:02:26.750> over<00:02:26.989> time

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
sometimes mess the trigger up over time

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.170 
sometimes mess the trigger up over time
a<00:02:27.230> trigger<00:02:27.769> will<00:02:28.010> wear<00:02:28.160> out<00:02:28.370> on<00:02:28.579> it<00:02:28.760> or<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:28.970> pad

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
a trigger will wear out on it or the pad

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.330 
a trigger will wear out on it or the pad
