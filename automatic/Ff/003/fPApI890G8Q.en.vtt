00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.960
 good afternoon, well, let us continue 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.279
 he is another one let's say under the video lesson 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.220
 the next one . 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:12.740
 the last time we raised this 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:18.890
 the bottom and the five-story building with basement 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:22.159
 floor at the bottom yes here we have left 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.470
 do some music and that something 

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:28.519
 finish up to and 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:31.750
 and still make some say therefore in 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:35.840
 these but cleaning up in the scheme before loading into 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.960
 already scat itself what we do we also 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:44.570
 make a front view 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:48.859
 we click fragmentation right click 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:52.059
 mouse all the elements of the rectangle us 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:52.059
 also interested 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:01:04.550
 top floor confirmation with 3d 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:06.980
 that's what we do here we will do 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.510
 following we see the walls here and 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:14.320
 basement floor 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.320
 i.e. just a circuit we turn on the walls 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:27.080
 there will be walls 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:27.080
 w2 they have a name bearing the thickness let it be 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:35.310
 003 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:37.060
 35 meters b20 material that's height 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.759
 we will 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:46.780
 we will enter from the center of the foundation 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:55.240
 plates 4.65 so here we press ok 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:58.899
 Hop hop hop hop hop and that's just such a 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:03.850
 I think this is all very simple 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:06.450
 it should be clear like this 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:11.980
 the way we all entered 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:16.590
 Here we look X-ray how this 3d looks 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:21.060
 looks like this 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:24.519
 principle, everything is very simple 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:28.319
 persist on here we return this 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:31.540
 shemka all our back here it is with us 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:35.250
 further before loading the ramp need more 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:41.380
 do two things that is make it 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:46.170
 data packing yes i have empty block 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:48.910
 we will remove them further and 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.450
 produce a control model 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:56.500
 all errors that is, such as we say 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:59.440
 so there are no gross formal errors 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:03.640
 now basically we can do it all for 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:06.160
 as if to throw in scad here in 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.000
 there are some loads 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.820
 and here we are 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:16.310
 here that is as if we are normative 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:19.550
 will go to the ramp itself we turn on 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:25.000
 tab's scheme there is such here 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:25.000
 button to generate a citing project 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.400
 here we are well, let's say step 0 5 such 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:36.380
 less effective 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:39.620
 here and click ok here we have here 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:44.650
 and asks us to save the file in the format 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:48.050
 scada himself falling into a daddy with a date 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.910
 click save it will take here this then 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.680
 there is as it is common to generation 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.989
 the resulting project rules will take 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:59.709
 some time but there are 510 explosive minutes 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:59.709
 well depending on the size of the circuit here
