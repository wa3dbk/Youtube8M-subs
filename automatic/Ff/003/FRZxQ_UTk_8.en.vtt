00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.110
 for everyone 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.210
 hello everyone and welcome to the little face 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.860
 face to face with phone in this little 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.230
 face to face with a fan page 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.940
 i'm going to talk about sims 3 mainly 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.960
 because there are many who are 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.369
 asked if he tries once 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.320
 supernatural and make their come back and no 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.060
 I do not need to do a second 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.070
 episode on it rather be considered 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.380
 like a special episode seeming because 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.989
 that I have too much respect on the sims 3 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.410
 and I would like to leave room for 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:34.690
 the sims cats that will come out in surprise 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.710
 so here it is in a moment but in 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.969
 I do not have the impression that autumn 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.690
 this time if we fall that so that I 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:40.359
 guard of the place 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.219
 yeah I would also like to talk a moron 

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:43.719
 who leave who give me your opinion 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:45.010
 on it but I think I'm going 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:46.030
 stop a multitude simply because 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.280
 I have no purpose 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.809
 I do not have fun basics on it at the beginning 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.890
 said it was really fun because 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:52.269
 that I was on the dream tour 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.320
 it was a brand new adam there was 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:54.789
 something interesting to do on 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.829
 the dream islands is now the islands 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:58.329
 dream are so totally buggy it's 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:59.679
 totally messed up and I confess you little 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.870
 bothering little lost in what I could 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:03.429
 to do or not there and I'm having fun 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.720
 more than that and I think it's 

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:08.110
 feel a little bit in my videos not 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.610
 my hat 1 delirious migros but so I 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.970
 think I just stop or and 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.829
 who did you actually tell me what 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.329
 what do you think 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:17.530
 and that's normal when you have a lot who 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:19.710
 are stressed because I said that 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.869
 I was going to move cream and rex 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.729
 but it will be to replace the six times 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.740
 multi kit there will be a new series on 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.390
 chrome and rex and their two children 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.950
 kendrick and logan 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.659
 so I thought I 'd do like 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.409
 a new drunken series follow their 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:33.820
 family etc 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.820
 the first two episodes would 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.799
 men would be kind on the 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.210
 building the house and I do not know 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.439
 said word what we think and I have not 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.420
 still really the idea it allowed me 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:46.299
 also to free up space in the 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.430
 trevor's house and miki because they 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.320
 so have not much to know that he 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.960
 would stay if I do something new on 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.930
 cream and rect he had very very close and 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.640
 in the same city as trevor and micky 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.880
 and it would be the same city with still 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.170
 every taste every subscriber always 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.399
 and they will be able to see relationships at 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.659
 cousins â€‹â€‹cousins etc 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.020
 you see what I mean to the world 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.220
 it would be to change one wish 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.600
 so and west you think jÃ©rÃ´me 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.580

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.420

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.510

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:21.370

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.990

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.130
 above these quarrels 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.320
 we will create some and its results and 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.150
 see how I can write it all 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.010
 all that and I think it can be 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.300

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.630
 ask if I'm going to make it to mind on 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:55.150
 the single yes but no it will not be 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.390
 with monster monster characters etc 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.980
 fall on them but they will all 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.420
 their secondary characters that we 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.060
 can cross in the city and it's 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.770
 normally so they will be added little 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.120
 little insult to my special series 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.680
