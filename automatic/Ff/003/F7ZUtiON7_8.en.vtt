brass just ends there and you got the

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.270 
brass just ends there and you got the
wood<00:03:51.840> thinning<00:03:52.840> there<00:03:53.170> which<00:03:53.680> is<00:03:53.800> very<00:03:53.860> cool

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280

clip design there is no clip to even

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.450 
clip design there is no clip to even
have<00:04:15.550> a<00:04:15.580> design<00:04:15.940> so<00:04:16.420> that<00:04:16.750> may<00:04:17.650> be<00:04:17.710> a<00:04:17.920> problem

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:18.460 
have a design so that may be a problem

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:21.590 
have a design so that may be a problem
for<00:04:18.790> you<00:04:18.910> guys<00:04:19.090> and<00:04:19.330> you<00:04:20.320> know<00:04:20.770> whatever

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
like I said before this is you know kind

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
for a while so those kind of a reason

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.580 
for a while so those kind of a reason
for<00:04:30.910> that<00:04:31.180> it's<00:04:31.390> a<00:04:31.510> good<00:04:31.750> knife<00:04:31.990> it's<00:04:32.320> very

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
for that it's a good knife it's very

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.610 
for that it's a good knife it's very
durable<00:04:32.860> and<00:04:33.250> it's<00:04:33.640> just<00:04:33.910> very<00:04:33.970> you<00:04:34.420> know

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
durable and it's just very you know

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.870 
durable and it's just very you know
high-quality<00:04:35.620> in<00:04:35.920> its<00:04:36.340> way<00:04:36.460> I<00:04:36.490> mean<00:04:36.670> this<00:04:36.730> is

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
high-quality in its way I mean this is

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.650 
high-quality in its way I mean this is
an<00:04:37.030> expensive<00:04:37.450> knife<00:04:37.630> it's<00:04:37.840> fairly<00:04:38.680> expensive

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
an expensive knife it's fairly expensive

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.170 
an expensive knife it's fairly expensive
not<00:04:40.660> for<00:04:41.280> like<00:04:42.280> real<00:04:42.490> like<00:04:42.730> if<00:04:42.910> you<00:04:43.000> have<00:04:43.150> a

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
not for like real like if you have a

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.700 
not for like real like if you have a
bench<00:04:43.390> made<00:04:43.600> this<00:04:43.750> isn't<00:04:44.080> expensive<00:04:44.260> for<00:04:44.590> you

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
bench made this isn't expensive for you

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.040 
bench made this isn't expensive for you
but<00:04:44.740> for<00:04:45.160> just<00:04:45.400> you<00:04:45.550> know<00:04:45.580> common<00:04:46.570> collector

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
but for just you know common collector

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.730 
but for just you know common collector
standards<00:04:47.500> something<00:04:48.340> around<00:04:48.460> 70<00:04:49.000> $80<00:04:49.740> is

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
standards something around 70 $80 is

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.940 
standards something around 70 $80 is
fairly<00:04:51.130> fairly<00:04:51.880> much<00:04:52.150> for<00:04:52.360> a<00:04:52.390> knife<00:04:52.770> so<00:04:53.770> that's

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
fairly fairly much for a knife so that's

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.400 
fairly fairly much for a knife so that's
just<00:04:54.040> something<00:04:54.280> taken<00:04:54.820> to<00:04:55.240> account<00:04:55.510> if<00:04:55.990> you

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
just something taken to account if you

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.770 
just something taken to account if you
know<00:04:56.470> if<00:04:56.770> you<00:04:57.100> buy<00:04:57.460> high-end<00:04:57.970> knives<00:04:58.450> all<00:04:58.690> the
