some<00:00:21.090> of<00:00:21.120> the<00:00:21.240> common<00:00:21.690> elements<00:00:21.900> that<00:00:22.500> silk

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
some of the common elements that silk

some of the common elements that silk
grilling<00:00:23.460> has<00:00:24.050> first<00:00:25.050> we<00:00:25.289> have<00:00:25.530> what's<00:00:26.039> called

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:26.449 
grilling has first we have what's called

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:32.420 
grilling has first we have what's called
suna-chan<00:00:28.369> which<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:29.610> the<00:00:29.880> natural<00:00:31.070> flow<00:00:32.070> of

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
suna-chan which is the natural flow of

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.139 
suna-chan which is the natural flow of
movement<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.390> we<00:00:34.289> have<00:00:34.499> nee-chan<00:00:35.159> which<00:00:35.969> is

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
movement and we have nee-chan which is

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.229 
movement and we have nee-chan which is
the<00:00:36.390> opposite<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.170> reverse<00:00:37.559> flow<00:00:38.120> when<00:00:39.120> we

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
the opposite the reverse flow when we

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.599 
the opposite the reverse flow when we
talk<00:00:39.479> about<00:00:39.749> the<00:00:39.929> arms<00:00:40.319> we<00:00:41.219> talked<00:00:41.460> about

00:00:41.599 --> 00:00:41.609 
talk about the arms we talked about

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:44.569 
talk about the arms we talked about
using<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.300> small<00:00:42.719> finger<00:00:43.109> for<00:00:43.589> the<00:00:43.739> shootin

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
using the small finger for the shootin

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.669 
using the small finger for the shootin
movement<00:00:45.409> yeah

00:00:46.669 --> 00:00:46.679 
movement yeah

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:51.579 
movement yeah
if<00:00:47.339> we<00:00:47.940> lead<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.899> movement<00:00:49.379> from<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.949> elbow

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:51.589 
if we lead the movement from the elbow

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:54.259 
if we lead the movement from the elbow
we<00:00:52.589> can<00:00:52.769> see<00:00:52.979> that<00:00:53.159> the<00:00:53.339> space<00:00:53.489> underneath<00:00:54.089> the

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:54.269 
we can see that the space underneath the

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:56.750 
we can see that the space underneath the
arm<00:00:54.539> pitch<00:00:54.929> collapses<00:00:55.859> one<00:00:56.159> of<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.399> common

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
arm pitch collapses one of the common

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.180 
arm pitch collapses one of the common
Tai<00:00:56.940> Chi<00:00:57.179> principles<00:00:57.749> is<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.409> maintain<00:00:59.129> a

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
Tai Chi principles is to maintain a

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.729 
Tai Chi principles is to maintain a
space<00:00:59.760> under<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.179> arm<00:01:00.479> piece<00:01:00.719> if<00:01:01.260> you

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
space under the arm piece if you

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.680 
space under the arm piece if you
collapse<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.429> space<00:01:02.789> under<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.149> arm<00:01:03.389> piece

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
collapse the space under the arm piece

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.190 
collapse the space under the arm piece
it's<00:01:04.260> very<00:01:04.500> easy<00:01:04.769> for<00:01:05.129> someone<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.600> lock<00:01:06.600> your

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
it's very easy for someone to lock your

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.880 
it's very easy for someone to lock your
arm<00:01:07.409> or<00:01:07.680> trap<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.189> rock<00:01:08.340> you're<00:01:08.579> on<00:01:09.890> similarly

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
arm or trap the rock you're on similarly

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.080 
arm or trap the rock you're on similarly
when<00:01:11.369> we<00:01:11.610> practice<00:01:12.240> nee-chan<00:01:12.600> movement<00:01:13.610> if<00:01:14.610> we

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
when we practice nee-chan movement if we

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.880 
when we practice nee-chan movement if we
lead<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.509> movement<00:01:15.930> from<00:01:16.109> the<00:01:16.289> elbow<00:01:16.680> the

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
lead the movement from the elbow the

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.550 
lead the movement from the elbow the
shoulder<00:01:17.399> raises<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:18.180> it's<00:01:18.750> also<00:01:19.049> easy<00:01:19.380> for

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
shoulder raises and it's also easy for

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.749 
shoulder raises and it's also easy for
someone<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.180> lock<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.780> arm<00:01:22.100> so<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.280> idea<00:01:23.640> is

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
someone to lock the arm so the idea is

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.880 
someone to lock the arm so the idea is
to<00:01:23.969> keep<00:01:24.149> the<00:01:24.329> elbow<00:01:24.659> dropped<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.380> use<00:01:25.680> the

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
to keep the elbow dropped and use the

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.139 
to keep the elbow dropped and use the
thumb<00:01:26.219> so<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.600> arms<00:01:28.020> we<00:01:28.799> have<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.250> small

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
thumb so in the arms we have this small

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:33.010 
thumb so in the arms we have this small
feeder<00:01:30.539> finger<00:01:31.229> leading<00:01:31.649> shun-chan<00:01:32.130> and

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
feeder finger leading shun-chan and

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.859 
feeder finger leading shun-chan and
thumb<00:01:34.020> leading<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.770> knee<00:01:35.009> Tran<00:01:35.399> movement<00:01:35.969> but

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
thumb leading the knee Tran movement but

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.929 
thumb leading the knee Tran movement but
it's<00:01:37.049> not<00:01:37.259> just<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.740> arm<00:01:37.920> it's<00:01:38.340> connected<00:01:38.909> to

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
it's not just the arm it's connected to

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.010 
it's not just the arm it's connected to
the<00:01:39.179> whole<00:01:39.359> body<00:01:39.659> in<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.920> legs<00:01:41.159> we<00:01:41.460> talk<00:01:41.700> about

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
the whole body in the legs we talk about

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.190 
the whole body in the legs we talk about
substantial<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.200> insubstantial<00:01:45.020> when<00:01:46.020> your

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
substantial and insubstantial when your

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.830 
substantial and insubstantial when your
weight<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.679> on<00:01:46.859> one<00:01:47.159> leg<00:01:47.429> as<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:48.270> moves<00:01:48.539> into

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
weight is on one leg as it moves into

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.319 
weight is on one leg as it moves into
one<00:01:49.170> leg<00:01:49.380> we<00:01:49.590> call<00:01:49.799> this<00:01:49.979> substantial<00:01:50.429> and<00:01:51.030> as

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
one leg we call this substantial and as

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.060 
one leg we call this substantial and as
it<00:01:51.479> moves<00:01:51.630> out<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.200> other<00:01:52.320> leg<00:01:52.560> we<00:01:52.710> call<00:01:52.920> it

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
it moves out to the other leg we call it

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.429 
it moves out to the other leg we call it
insubstantial<00:01:53.609> this<00:01:54.600> is<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.960> basic

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
insubstantial this is the basic

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.529 
insubstantial this is the basic
understanding<00:01:55.789> it's<00:01:56.789> a<00:01:56.969> little<00:01:57.210> bit<00:01:57.329> more

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
understanding it's a little bit more

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:59.959 
understanding it's a little bit more
complex<00:01:58.049> than<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.409> if<00:01:59.009> we<00:01:59.159> look<00:01:59.340> at<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.670> Tai

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
complex than that if we look at the Tai

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.160 
complex than that if we look at the Tai
Chi<00:01:59.999> symbol<00:02:00.719> of<00:02:00.869> yin<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.200> yang<00:02:01.640> if<00:02:02.640> we<00:02:03.600> go<00:02:04.109> too

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
Chi symbol of yin and yang if we go too

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.990 
Chi symbol of yin and yang if we go too
far<00:02:04.759> for<00:02:05.759> our<00:02:05.819> knee<00:02:05.969> passes<00:02:06.569> our<00:02:07.319> toes<00:02:08.030> yeah

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
far for our knee passes our toes yeah

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.850 
far for our knee passes our toes yeah
we<00:02:10.780> can<00:02:10.990> say<00:02:11.260> that<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:11.950> movement<00:02:12.280> is<00:02:13.860> getting

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
we can say that the movement is getting

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.160 
we can say that the movement is getting
stuck<00:02:15.370> yeah<00:02:15.940> it's<00:02:16.030> going<00:02:16.330> too<00:02:16.600> far<00:02:16.870> I<00:02:16.900> get

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
stuck yeah it's going too far I get

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.930 
stuck yeah it's going too far I get
stuck<00:02:17.530> so<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:19.510> hips<00:02:19.870> need<00:02:20.200> to<00:02:20.380> be<00:02:20.500> relaxed<00:02:21.220> so

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
stuck so the hips need to be relaxed so

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.840 
stuck so the hips need to be relaxed so
that<00:02:22.120> we<00:02:22.330> just<00:02:22.600> move<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:22.960> way<00:02:23.370> certain<00:02:24.370> amount

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
that we just move the way certain amount

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.310 
that we just move the way certain amount
into<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.900> leg<00:02:26.080> if<00:02:26.500> we<00:02:27.160> move<00:02:27.880> too<00:02:28.210> far<00:02:28.570> into<00:02:29.020> the

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
into the leg if we move too far into the

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.720 
into the leg if we move too far into the
leg<00:02:29.530> yeah<00:02:30.370> we're<00:02:30.910> going<00:02:31.300> over<00:02:31.920> yeah<00:02:32.920> so<00:02:33.550> the

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
leg yeah we're going over yeah so the

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.180 
leg yeah we're going over yeah so the
idea<00:02:34.120> is<00:02:34.360> to<00:02:34.390> fill<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:35.230> movement<00:02:35.830> like<00:02:35.980> the

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
idea is to fill the movement like the

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.720 
idea is to fill the movement like the
Tai<00:02:36.460> Chi<00:02:36.490> symbol<00:02:37.120> of<00:02:37.300> yin<00:02:37.570> and<00:02:37.600> yang<00:02:38.730> yang

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
Tai Chi symbol of yin and yang yang

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.590 
Tai Chi symbol of yin and yang yang
turns<00:02:40.210> into<00:02:40.540> Yin<00:02:41.020> yeah<00:02:41.650> also<00:02:42.190> if<00:02:42.820> we<00:02:43.150> don't<00:02:43.390> go

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
turns into Yin yeah also if we don't go

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.500 
turns into Yin yeah also if we don't go
enough<00:02:44.020> if<00:02:44.410> we<00:02:44.709> just<00:02:45.130> come<00:02:45.370> to<00:02:45.580> here<00:02:45.940> we

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
enough if we just come to here we

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.040 
enough if we just come to here we
haven't<00:02:46.990> achieved<00:02:47.500> a<00:02:48.160> type<00:02:48.580> of<00:02:48.870> twisting<00:02:49.870> or

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
haven't achieved a type of twisting or

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.660 
haven't achieved a type of twisting or
coiling<00:02:50.800> in<00:02:50.920> the<00:02:51.010> body<00:02:51.250> which<00:02:52.090> is<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:54.190> basic

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
coiling in the body which is the basic

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.090 
coiling in the body which is the basic
essence<00:02:55.209> of<00:02:55.420> silk<00:02:55.900> reeling<00:02:56.140> movement<00:02:56.740> that<00:02:56.920> we

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
essence of silk reeling movement that we

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.520 
essence of silk reeling movement that we
have<00:02:57.280> this<00:02:57.520> twisting<00:02:58.510> and<00:02:58.720> coiling<00:02:59.110> in<00:02:59.440> the

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
have this twisting and coiling in the

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.360 
have this twisting and coiling in the
legs<00:03:00.420> same<00:03:01.420> in<00:03:01.600> this<00:03:01.750> like<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:03.010> insubstantial

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
legs same in this like the insubstantial

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.630 
legs same in this like the insubstantial
leg<00:03:04.320> if<00:03:05.320> we<00:03:05.620> go<00:03:05.770> too<00:03:05.830> far<00:03:06.040> it<00:03:06.700> collapses<00:03:07.570> yeah

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
leg if we go too far it collapses yeah

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.290 
leg if we go too far it collapses yeah
if<00:03:09.640> we<00:03:10.050> push<00:03:11.050> the<00:03:11.350> leg<00:03:11.560> out<00:03:11.890> you<00:03:12.610> are<00:03:12.700> forcing

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
if we push the leg out you are forcing

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.830 
if we push the leg out you are forcing
the<00:03:13.890> posture<00:03:14.890> open<00:03:15.400> we<00:03:16.209> actually<00:03:16.600> cause

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
the posture open we actually cause

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.960 
the posture open we actually cause
tension<00:03:17.440> in<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:17.709> hips<00:03:17.890> and<00:03:18.340> we<00:03:18.730> don't

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
tension in the hips and we don't

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.890 
tension in the hips and we don't
generate<00:03:19.480> this<00:03:19.810> twisting<00:03:20.620> in<00:03:20.800> the<00:03:20.920> legs<00:03:21.160> so

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
generate this twisting in the legs so

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.680 
generate this twisting in the legs so
it's<00:03:22.900> important<00:03:23.500> to<00:03:23.920> relax<00:03:24.640> the<00:03:25.209> hip<00:03:25.239> and

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
it's important to relax the hip and

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.070 
it's important to relax the hip and
allow<00:03:25.959> the<00:03:26.019> legs<00:03:26.410> to<00:03:26.560> twist<00:03:27.570> therefore<00:03:28.570> we

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
allow the legs to twist therefore we

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.229 
allow the legs to twist therefore we
have<00:03:29.260> just<00:03:29.860> the<00:03:30.130> right<00:03:30.340> amount<00:03:30.400> of<00:03:30.970> weight

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
have just the right amount of weight

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.920 
have just the right amount of weight
moving<00:03:31.690> into<00:03:32.080> one<00:03:32.260> leg<00:03:32.530> and<00:03:32.830> then<00:03:33.700> moving<00:03:34.600> into

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
moving into one leg and then moving into

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.840 
moving into one leg and then moving into
the<00:03:35.200> other<00:03:35.320> leg<00:03:35.560> so<00:03:35.920> this<00:03:36.430> is<00:03:36.580> called

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
the other leg so this is called

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:42.900 
the other leg so this is called
substantial<00:03:37.780> and<00:03:37.959> insubstantial<00:03:41.370> also<00:03:42.370> when

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
substantial and insubstantial also when

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.740 
substantial and insubstantial also when
we<00:03:43.120> relax<00:03:43.510> our<00:03:43.900> hips<00:03:44.260> and<00:03:44.670> twist<00:03:45.670> our<00:03:46.060> waist

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
we relax our hips and twist our waist

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.530 
we relax our hips and twist our waist
yeah<00:03:47.170> our<00:03:47.410> knees<00:03:47.830> naturally<00:03:48.730> move<00:03:48.970> in<00:03:49.120> a<00:03:49.239> type

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
yeah our knees naturally move in a type

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.539 
yeah our knees naturally move in a type
of<00:03:49.570> an<00:03:49.980> s-curve<00:03:51.040> we<00:03:52.030> don't<00:03:52.500> ya<00:03:53.500> try<00:03:53.980> to<00:03:54.130> move

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
of an s-curve we don't ya try to move

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.930 
of an s-curve we don't ya try to move
the<00:03:54.790> knees<00:03:55.000> in<00:03:55.570> this<00:03:56.380> figure<00:03:57.040> eight<00:03:57.370> movement

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
the knees in this figure eight movement

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.050 
the knees in this figure eight movement
but<00:03:58.570> it<00:03:58.720> naturally<00:03:59.500> happens<00:03:59.980> when<00:04:00.580> we<00:04:00.760> shift

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
but it naturally happens when we shift

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.100 
but it naturally happens when we shift
our<00:04:01.269> weight<00:04:01.380> turn<00:04:02.380> our<00:04:02.709> waist<00:04:03.570> this<00:04:04.570> movement

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
our weight turn our waist this movement

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.160 
our weight turn our waist this movement
I'm<00:04:05.230> showing<00:04:05.650> is<00:04:05.830> called<00:04:06.340> moving<00:04:07.150> the<00:04:07.540> dong<00:04:07.810> in

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
I'm showing is called moving the dong in

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.550 
I'm showing is called moving the dong in
a<00:04:08.290> backward<00:04:08.860> arc<00:04:09.420> yeah<00:04:10.420> so<00:04:10.720> when<00:04:10.870> I<00:04:10.900> relax<00:04:11.380> the

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
a backward arc yeah so when I relax the

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.729 
a backward arc yeah so when I relax the
hip<00:04:11.860> the<00:04:12.430> leg<00:04:12.670> twists<00:04:13.269> and<00:04:13.570> the<00:04:14.049> knee<00:04:14.230> moves<00:04:14.560> in

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
hip the leg twists and the knee moves in

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:17.180 
hip the leg twists and the knee moves in
an<00:04:15.060> s-curve

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
an s-curve

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.640 
an s-curve
okay<00:04:18.190> the<00:04:18.759> toes<00:04:19.060> should<00:04:19.509> likely<00:04:19.810> grab<00:04:20.320> the

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
okay the toes should likely grab the

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.560 
okay the toes should likely grab the
floor<00:04:21.100> yeah<00:04:22.000> and<00:04:22.270> don't<00:04:22.419> lift<00:04:22.780> the<00:04:23.050> toes<00:04:23.919> up

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
floor yeah and don't lift the toes up

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.490 
floor yeah and don't lift the toes up
yeah<00:04:26.970> this<00:04:27.970> is<00:04:28.090> in<00:04:28.240> the<00:04:28.360> lower<00:04:28.509> body<00:04:28.900> so<00:04:29.350> we

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
yeah this is in the lower body so we

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.290 
yeah this is in the lower body so we
have<00:04:30.300> soon-jong<00:04:31.889> nee-chan<00:04:33.120> we<00:04:34.120> have

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
have soon-jong nee-chan we have

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.860 
have soon-jong nee-chan we have
substantial<00:04:34.949> insubstantial<00:04:36.180> in<00:04:37.180> changing

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
substantial insubstantial in changing

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.340 
substantial insubstantial in changing
into<00:04:38.169> yarn<00:04:39.389> for<00:04:40.389> the<00:04:40.539> breathing<00:04:41.310> we<00:04:42.310> have

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
into yarn for the breathing we have

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.300 
into yarn for the breathing we have
normally<00:04:44.350> when<00:04:44.850> we<00:04:45.850> close<00:04:46.780> we<00:04:47.620> breathe<00:04:47.949> in

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
normally when we close we breathe in

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.550 
normally when we close we breathe in
yeah<00:04:49.300> when<00:04:50.050> we<00:04:50.320> open<00:04:51.039> we<00:04:51.550> breathe<00:04:51.880> out<00:04:52.530> yeah

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
yeah when we open we breathe out yeah

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.460 
yeah when we open we breathe out yeah
also<00:04:54.460> in<00:04:54.759> Tai<00:04:55.000> Chi<00:04:55.030> when<00:04:55.539> you<00:04:55.690> lift<00:04:55.960> your<00:04:56.080> arms

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
also in Tai Chi when you lift your arms

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.990 
also in Tai Chi when you lift your arms
up<00:04:56.650> you<00:04:57.009> normally<00:04:57.520> breathe<00:04:57.849> in<00:04:59.490> when<00:05:00.490> you<00:05:00.639> sink

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
up you normally breathe in when you sink

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.580 
up you normally breathe in when you sink
down<00:05:01.090> you<00:05:01.870> breathe<00:05:02.259> out<00:05:03.449> yeah<00:05:04.449> when<00:05:05.349> you

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
down you breathe out yeah when you

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.700 
down you breathe out yeah when you
gather<00:05:05.889> your<00:05:06.849> strength<00:05:07.180> in<00:05:08.160> you<00:05:09.160> breathe<00:05:09.460> in

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
gather your strength in you breathe in

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:17.760 
gather your strength in you breathe in
yeah<00:05:15.060> and<00:05:16.060> when<00:05:16.389> you<00:05:16.419> release<00:05:16.900> you<00:05:17.440> breathe

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
yeah and when you release you breathe

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.360 
yeah and when you release you breathe
out<00:05:18.419> so<00:05:19.419> this<00:05:19.960> is<00:05:20.020> just<00:05:20.410> some<00:05:20.710> of<00:05:20.740> the<00:05:20.979> common

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
out so this is just some of the common

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.000 
out so this is just some of the common
ways<00:05:21.550> to<00:05:21.810> coordinate<00:05:22.810> breathing<00:05:23.800> with

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
ways to coordinate breathing with

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:28.080
