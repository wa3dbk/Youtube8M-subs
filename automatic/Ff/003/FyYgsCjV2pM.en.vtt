00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.700
 very important indicated 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.310
 I was flying as well as you know on Mondays or the fresh fish so I decided to do 

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:10.620
 something frozen 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.280
 and since the octopus has to be frozen before cooking it, it seemed like a good 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.240
 option if we have it frozen we take it out first thing in the morning already 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.870
 lunchtime will already know thawed first we will not scare three times 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.060
 that is to say we are going to put it and take it out in abundant boiling water three times and 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.880
 then we will not leave apo strong for about twenty twenty-five minutes 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.179
 on the other hand we are going to appeal a couple of kicks 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.200
 we passed them by 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.700
 and we're going to chop them into cubes and it's important that everyone has more or less 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.700
 of the same size so that they are made at the same time 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.520
 efe 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.460
 and this time we're going to grow the steamed vegetables 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.549
 for that ellis needs a pot that has this type of party and in this case 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:13.210
 I'm going to do it with the express pot to go faster because you know that it has a 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.310
 culÃ­n of water and that when putting to the fire goes by there then of the vegetable yes already 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.759
 I know what carrot and distant potato do not have the same cooking time but 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.010
 I will not be opening and closing the pit every five minutes the octopus 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.270
 It takes about 20 25 minutes 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.360
 the fear to stop and now we're going to put out the fire we covered it the twenties 

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:33.850
 more minutes 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.340
 juanes as laziness to taste between six and ten minutes approximately and then 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.340
 you can remove it and let it cool 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.210
 it's time to remove the octopus 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.880
 and now it's about letting it cool for 15 minutes 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.340
 and when it is already room temperature that we stay the fingers we cut it 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.340
 and we add it to the vegetables 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:20.959
 this is that easy now let's clean it 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.080
 a pinch of salt a drizzle of olive oil 

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:30.869
 and a spoonful of mayonnaise 

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:34.909
 we mix everything well yara that would be cool from the fridge if I do not 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:39.019
 cover pillar sÃ¡ez in the refrigerator a half hour and it is ready but that 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.719
 He liked a hug until then
