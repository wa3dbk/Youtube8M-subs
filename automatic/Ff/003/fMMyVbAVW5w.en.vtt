00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.360
 hello and that he may be 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.850
 castriot pro today I make you 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.629
 a comparison between the galaxy s 4 and the 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.230
 xperia z 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.910
 so I want to first show you the 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.559
 design of the two games you compare the 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.690
 eggs and then I conjure you 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.900
 also compare a little the fluidity of 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.720
 devices then first left there 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.080
 bequeathed rest 4 and the right there is the 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.539
 xperia z then already we see that it's 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.179
 not at all the same design we see that 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.690
 already already this one is totally 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.739
 reverse and that one is plastic 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:40.260
 so it's not at all the same 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.489
 I have in the back we see that it's 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.559
 not at all the same thing either huh 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.570
 then the gorna the 3 megapixel sensor 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:51.149
 on both sides here here and here 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.460
 then we have the led flash here and there 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.899
 do not know if it's a led flash 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.230
 it is less powerful than that of 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.680
 galaxy s 4g then notice down the 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:08.580
 galaxy s 4 we have the speaker that of the 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:11.510
 xperia z is here then already on the on 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.189
 the right slice here kind compare 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.729
 then on the right slice of both 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.070
 appliances 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:23.250
 so we will compare with the pop jazz 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.409
 we'll do like that sooner then here 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.240
 on the right edge of the galaxy s 4 we have 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.950
 the same on / off button here then we have 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.990
 on the experience is always right 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:40.229
 we have the volume the shower volume 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.740
 then we hide it here for the map 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.259
 sim 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.060
 here is the cash for the post 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:52.829
 helmet 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:54.230
 here we have the microphone jack for the headphones 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.840
 such forgiveness 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.880
 then we have the infrared sensor for 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:03.320
 order the tv on the galaxy s 4 here 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.540
 here we have the microphone here on 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.000
 the strange left 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:12.350
 then we assure the galaxy the xperia z 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.580
 sorry we have the cash to plug it into 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:21.290
 the computer sector here we have the cash 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.850
 for the the micro SD card there for the 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.100
 dock 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.260
 here we just have the volume knob in 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:31.160
 here and before balla we have a hen 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.950
 which was not a button touch it here 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.720
 is activated here no here it's a button 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.880
 hot as they say but it's a barrel 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.280
 then press it 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.050
 and always the same there we have 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.280
 multiple sensors or galaxy s 4g 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.980
 for the gestures thing is also we have the 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.260
 seeing it notification on both but 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.030
 we also have the 2 megapixel camera here and 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.700
 right here 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:59.540
 So here we are already going to compare for 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:03.260
 the screen the screen of the two I'm here 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.900
 it's an amoled hd and the other one is a 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.730
 sony screen which is less good for 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.660
 according to me end for me it is less 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:14.930
 well already we will compare the already seen 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.730
 a difference tac 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.030
 here we are not going too much on the camera but 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.160
 when we shift to the side with the 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.020
 xperia zeal the colors are a little 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.570
 pale while on the galaxy s cats 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.459
 always the same thing then already on the 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:33.730
 fluidity of the menu it's not the same thing 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:36.800
 no longer so it's very very fluid 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.910
 see and it's a little less fluid 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:43.459
 that's it ream a few times 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:46.670
 this is then on the galaxy s katz and 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.830
 the android 4.2.2 coop reads on the 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.240
 xperia z 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:53.370
 c 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:55.260
 the acetate shirt and here it is 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:59.250
 the sony interface it's not at all the 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:01.050
 same thing no longer tech so then to 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.180
 sorry for the picture quality it's not 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.680
 terrible 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.090
 we've already tied yes it's not 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:11.040
 all the same thing we have a lot more 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.910
 of options and so here is 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.440
 battery level 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:18.510
 I have no big difference I 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:21.800
 I saw after one thing that's pretty much 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:24.450
 the same thing for both of you so here 

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:27.900
 what else can I say 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.600
 on the two devices down is pretty much 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:34.100
 near the same price I believe now 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:37.170
 samsung lowered the price of galaxy s 4 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.770
 the xperia zeal and 500 euros too I 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.700
 mourn her breast at 500 euros 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.970
 so that's what I can say 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:48.630
 on both tech 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.880
 here I am glad I am going to buy 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.310
 of galaxy s 4 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.870
 So here I have it is much more 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.220
 fluid 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:05:02.880
 on the other hand on the gala proud-es four 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:04.650
 ways the standard is abusing a little bit that's the 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.570
 galaxy s 4 and ticket is a little bit more 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.570
 fast is much more fluid 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:12.720
 here is the xperia z good after it is 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:15.510
 not waterproof and therefore this also is 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.040
 a lot more option on that there it is 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.100
 why I made you a short 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:24.360
 comparison between the xperia z and the 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:26.190
 galaxy s 4 that's up to the boss and itouch the 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.120
 crisis to pro tools a comparative between 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.900
 these two devices 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.900
 thank you
