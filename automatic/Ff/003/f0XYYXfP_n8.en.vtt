beads and place three right here one
right<00:00:57.829> there<00:00:58.190> one<00:00:58.219> right<00:00:58.550> there

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
right there one right there

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.060

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
right here one right there three right

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.479 
right here one right there three right
there<00:01:02.930> and<00:01:03.050> one<00:01:03.230> right<00:01:03.260> there<00:01:03.590> and<00:01:03.800> then<00:01:04.280> for

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
there and one right there and then for

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.499 
there and one right there and then for
like<00:01:04.640> the<00:01:04.940> insight<00:01:06.280> Masari<00:01:07.280> inside<00:01:07.940> part<00:01:08.330> of

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:08.509 
like the insight Masari inside part of

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:10.510 
like the insight Masari inside part of
the<00:01:08.899> ear<00:01:09.080> just<00:01:09.110> add<00:01:09.560> two<00:01:09.860> right<00:01:10.009> here<00:01:10.190> in<00:01:10.340> two

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
the ear just add two right here in two

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.490 
the ear just add two right here in two
right<00:01:10.640> there<00:01:10.850> and<00:01:11.149> do<00:01:11.780> the<00:01:11.899> same<00:01:12.080> exact<00:01:12.470> thing

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
right there and do the same exact thing

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.020 
right there and do the same exact thing
to<00:01:12.890> this<00:01:13.039> side<00:01:13.310> so<00:01:13.550> just<00:01:13.580> add<00:01:13.940> 1<00:01:14.209> 1<00:01:14.240> 3<00:01:14.869> 1<00:01:15.319> 3<00:01:15.619> 1<00:01:16.610> 1

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
to this side so just add 1 1 3 1 3 1 1

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.949 
to this side so just add 1 1 3 1 3 1 1
and<00:01:17.360> then<00:01:17.450> 2<00:01:17.750> 2<00:01:18.110> and<00:01:18.850> the<00:01:19.850> next<00:01:20.090> step<00:01:20.270> is<00:01:20.479> to

00:01:20.949 --> 00:01:20.959 
and then 2 2 and the next step is to

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:23.740 
and then 2 2 and the next step is to
fill<00:01:21.590> in<00:01:21.800> the<00:01:21.920> ears<00:01:22.160> so<00:01:22.759> this<00:01:22.970> part<00:01:23.300> just<00:01:23.509> add

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
fill in the ears so this part just add

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.719 
fill in the ears so this part just add
yellow<00:01:24.020> beads<00:01:24.349> and<00:01:24.590> then<00:01:24.770> on<00:01:24.950> this<00:01:25.280> side<00:01:25.340> add

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
yellow beads and then on this side add

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:27.669 
yellow beads and then on this side add
brown<00:01:26.030> beads<00:01:26.270> and<00:01:26.539> do<00:01:26.990> the<00:01:27.080> same<00:01:27.229> exact<00:01:27.619> thing

00:01:27.669 --> 00:01:27.679 
brown beads and do the same exact thing

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:30.639 
brown beads and do the same exact thing
to<00:01:28.220> it<00:01:28.550> this<00:01:28.700> air<00:01:28.970> so<00:01:29.869> this<00:01:30.020> is<00:01:30.170> what<00:01:30.349> it<00:01:30.470> should

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649 
to it this air so this is what it should

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:32.410 
to it this air so this is what it should
look<00:01:30.709> like<00:01:30.860> after<00:01:31.250> you<00:01:31.610> have<00:01:31.729> done<00:01:31.910> that<00:01:31.970> and

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
look like after you have done that and

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.350 
look like after you have done that and
as<00:01:32.690> you<00:01:32.840> can<00:01:32.990> tell<00:01:33.050> on<00:01:33.920> both<00:01:34.550> ears<00:01:34.819> I<00:01:35.000> just

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
as you can tell on both ears I just

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.510 
as you can tell on both ears I just
added<00:01:35.599> yellow<00:01:36.200> beads<00:01:36.590> right<00:01:36.800> here<00:01:37.069> and<00:01:37.310> brown

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
added yellow beads right here and brown

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.089 
added yellow beads right here and brown
beads<00:01:37.819> right<00:01:38.030> there<00:01:38.330> so<00:01:39.140> the<00:01:39.349> last<00:01:39.530> step<00:01:39.740> or

00:01:40.089 --> 00:01:40.099 
beads right there so the last step or

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:42.219 
beads right there so the last step or
not<00:01:40.399> the<00:01:40.550> last<00:01:40.670> step<00:01:40.789> sorry<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:41.420> next<00:01:41.750> step<00:01:41.959> is

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
not the last step sorry the next step is

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.169 
not the last step sorry the next step is
to<00:01:42.590> get<00:01:42.770> your<00:01:42.830> white<00:01:43.130> perler<00:01:43.520> beads<00:01:43.729> and<00:01:44.000> just

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:44.179 
to get your white perler beads and just

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:46.719 
to get your white perler beads and just
place<00:01:44.479> full<00:01:45.229> right<00:01:45.440> here<00:01:45.800> -<00:01:46.310> right<00:01:46.340> there<00:01:46.700> -

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
place full right here - right there -

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.490 
place full right here - right there -
right<00:01:47.360> there<00:01:47.599> and<00:01:47.810> one<00:01:47.959> right<00:01:47.990> there

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
right there and one right there

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.650 
right there and one right there
and<00:01:48.800> then<00:01:49.039> two<00:01:49.369> right<00:01:49.550> here<00:01:49.789> and<00:01:50.090> four<00:01:50.539> right

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
and then two right here and four right

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.290 
and then two right here and four right
here<00:01:50.929> and<00:01:51.229> then<00:01:51.860> just<00:01:52.130> place<00:01:52.369> two<00:01:52.880> more<00:01:53.060> right

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
here and then just place two more right

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.999 
here and then just place two more right
here<00:01:53.599> and<00:01:53.899> then<00:01:54.020> three<00:01:54.380> right<00:01:54.590> there

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
here and then three right there

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.540 
here and then three right there
and<00:01:55.569> the<00:01:56.569> next<00:01:56.780> step<00:01:57.050> is<00:01:57.259> to<00:01:57.679> get<00:01:57.979> your<00:01:58.039> brown

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
and the next step is to get your brown

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.210 
and the next step is to get your brown
perler<00:01:58.940> beads<00:01:59.149> and<00:01:59.390> fill<00:01:59.599> in<00:01:59.780> all<00:02:00.259> of<00:02:00.319> his<00:02:00.950> head

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
perler beads and fill in all of his head

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.729 
perler beads and fill in all of his head
with<00:02:01.750> it<00:02:02.750> so<00:02:02.840> once<00:02:02.989> you<00:02:03.110> have<00:02:03.200> done<00:02:03.259> that<00:02:03.440> it

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:03.739 
with it so once you have done that it

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:04.990 
with it so once you have done that it
should<00:02:03.920> look<00:02:04.009> something<00:02:04.069> like<00:02:04.459> this

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
should look something like this

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.609 
should look something like this
and<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.239> last<00:02:05.420> step<00:02:05.599> is<00:02:05.750> just<00:02:05.780> to<00:02:06.020> iron<00:02:06.289> it<00:02:06.590> and

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
and the last step is just to iron it and

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.620 
and the last step is just to iron it and
once<00:02:07.069> you<00:02:07.160> have<00:02:07.310> ironed<00:02:07.670> it<00:02:07.789> it<00:02:08.030> should<00:02:08.509> look
