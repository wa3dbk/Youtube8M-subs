00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
an ipad mini but still the way it is a

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.250 
an ipad mini but still the way it is a
pretty<00:00:57.930> decent<00:00:59.090> the<00:01:00.090> 8<00:01:00.180> inch<00:01:00.480> screen<00:01:00.899> has<00:01:01.230> a

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
pretty decent the 8 inch screen has a

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.530 
pretty decent the 8 inch screen has a
resolution<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:02.989> 1280<00:01:03.989> x<00:01:04.409> 800<00:01:04.830> pixels<00:01:05.540> HD

resolution of 1280 x 800 pixels HD
resolution<00:01:07.200> pixel<00:01:08.159> density<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:08.850> not<00:01:09.119> really

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
resolution pixel density is not really

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.100 
resolution pixel density is not really
spectacular<00:01:10.680> but<00:01:11.640> it's<00:01:11.729> still<00:01:11.939> pretty<00:01:12.840> good

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
spectacular but it's still pretty good

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.620 
spectacular but it's still pretty good
you<00:01:13.680> all<00:01:13.830> have<00:01:14.100> much<00:01:14.310> trouble<00:01:14.610> reading<00:01:15.210> your

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
you all have much trouble reading your

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.710 
you all have much trouble reading your
ebooks<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.520> news<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.880> such<00:01:18.090> kind<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:18.420> stuff

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
ebooks and news and such kind of stuff

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
ebooks and news and such kind of stuff
so<00:01:20.150> we<00:01:21.150> would<00:01:21.600> have<00:01:21.720> liked<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.470> more<00:01:22.680> if

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
so we would have liked it more if

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.999 
so we would have liked it more if
Samsung<00:01:23.340> has<00:01:23.930> managed<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.140> fit<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.530> bit<00:01:25.830> more

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
Samsung has managed to fit a bit more

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.429 
Samsung has managed to fit a bit more
resolution<00:01:26.729> here<00:01:27.060> but<00:01:27.750> probably<00:01:28.110> for<00:01:28.409> the

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
resolution here but probably for the

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.679 
resolution here but probably for the
next<00:01:29.220> model<00:01:31.100> the<00:01:32.100> processor<00:01:32.579> inside<00:01:32.909> inside

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
next model the processor inside inside

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.749 
next model the processor inside inside
is<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.530> same<00:01:34.770> one<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.460> in<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.479> galaxy<00:01:37.350> note<00:01:37.759> to

whoever its clocked a bit higher it's a

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.230
