00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.520 
obviously it's like a nice matte finish
but<00:01:29.280> by<00:01:29.909> because<00:01:30.240> on<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.930> sides<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.439> the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
but by because on the sides and the

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.730 
but by because on the sides and the
corners<00:01:31.560> it's<00:01:32.070> some<00:01:32.960> double<00:01:33.960> insulated<00:01:34.290> so<00:01:34.650> if

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
corners it's some double insulated so if

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.410 
corners it's some double insulated so if
you<00:01:34.860> do<00:01:34.950> drop<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.520> will<00:01:35.670> definitely<00:01:35.880> absorb

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
you do drop it it will definitely absorb

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.120 
you do drop it it will definitely absorb
the<00:01:36.540> shock<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.380> it's<00:01:37.500> also<00:01:37.590> got<00:01:37.770> like<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:37.950> nice

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
not supposed to they recommend you

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.310 
not supposed to they recommend you
putting<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.460> with<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:03.060> hard<00:02:03.360> case<00:02:03.509> on<00:02:03.689> but<00:02:03.960> you

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
putting it with a hard case on but you

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.440 
putting it with a hard case on but you
can<00:02:04.469> do<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.619> either<00:02:04.710> way<00:02:04.909> so<00:02:05.909> also<00:02:06.329> another

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
can do it either way so also another

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.029 
can do it either way so also another
thing<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:06.840> do<00:02:06.930> like<00:02:07.049> about<00:02:07.110> this<00:02:07.380> case<00:02:07.590> is<00:02:07.829> that

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
thing I do like about this case is that

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.790 
thing I do like about this case is that
on<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.729> sides<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.390> is<00:02:09.509> lifted<00:02:10.110> slightly<00:02:10.349> so<00:02:10.739> if

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
on the sides it is lifted slightly so if

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.920 
on the sides it is lifted slightly so if
you<00:02:10.890> do<00:02:11.009> places<00:02:11.310> phone<00:02:11.610> flat<00:02:12.180> on<00:02:12.330> table<00:02:12.660> it

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
you do places phone flat on table it

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.480 
you do places phone flat on table it
will<00:02:13.080> die

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
will die

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.370 
will die
won't<00:02:13.790> be<00:02:13.940> actually<00:02:14.300> touching<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:14.720> glass<00:02:14.960> so

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
won't be actually touching the glass so

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.150 
won't be actually touching the glass so
that's<00:02:15.560> good<00:02:15.770> and<00:02:15.980> as<00:02:16.310> you<00:02:16.460> do<00:02:16.610> have<00:02:16.850> a

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
that's good and as you do have a

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.280 
that's good and as you do have a
tempered<00:02:19.160> glass<00:02:19.190> screen<00:02:19.790> on<00:02:20.660> my<00:02:20.690> phone<00:02:21.020> so

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
tempered glass screen on my phone so

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.070 
tempered glass screen on my phone so
that<00:02:21.830> helps<00:02:22.100> a<00:02:22.160> lot<00:02:22.310> so<00:02:22.580> this<00:02:23.240> phone<00:02:23.420> has<00:02:23.720> lived

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080
