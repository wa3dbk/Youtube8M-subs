suppose you could call it don't know
about<00:02:29.319> the<00:02:29.500> rear<00:02:29.709> I<00:02:29.739> know<00:02:30.040> everything<00:02:30.310> there's

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
about the rear I know everything there's

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.300 
about the rear I know everything there's
much<00:02:30.730> of<00:02:30.760> a<00:02:30.940> change<00:02:31.180> in<00:02:31.360> that<00:02:31.510> that<00:02:32.380> it's<00:02:33.250> not

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
much of a change in that that it's not

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.890 
much of a change in that that it's not
really<00:02:33.580> much<00:02:33.790> of<00:02:33.819> a<00:02:34.030> fast<00:02:34.239> thing<00:02:34.450> it's<00:02:34.569> only<00:02:34.750> if

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
really much of a fast thing it's only if

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.290 
really much of a fast thing it's only if
you're<00:02:35.140> a<00:02:35.200> real<00:02:36.069> completists<00:02:36.849> thing<00:02:37.090> and

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
you're a real completists thing and

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.259 
you're a real completists thing and
you're<00:02:38.260> purist<00:02:39.190> and<00:02:39.310> if<00:02:39.670> it<00:02:39.910> really<00:02:40.060> does

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
you're purist and if it really does

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.540 
you're purist and if it really does
bother<00:02:40.540> you<00:02:40.690> then<00:02:41.019> you<00:02:41.230> know<00:02:41.489> though<00:02:42.489> it

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
bother you then you know though it

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:43.770 
bother you then you know though it
doesn't<00:02:42.790> bother<00:02:42.849> me<00:02:43.000> it<00:02:43.180> looks<00:02:43.360> quite<00:02:43.480> good<00:02:43.540> on

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
doesn't bother me it looks quite good on

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.320 
doesn't bother me it looks quite good on
the<00:02:43.870> front<00:02:44.050> end<00:02:44.200> and<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:45.400> livery<00:02:45.700> itself<00:02:46.060> I

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
the front end and the livery itself I

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.809 
the front end and the livery itself I
have<00:02:46.720> to<00:02:46.810> think<00:02:46.930> it's<00:02:47.110> very<00:02:47.140> nice<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:48.100> color

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
have to think it's very nice the color

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:50.190 
have to think it's very nice the color
combinations<00:02:49.390> worked<00:02:49.600> really<00:02:49.750> well<00:02:49.840> for<00:02:50.140> it

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
combinations worked really well for it

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.420 
combinations worked really well for it
it's<00:02:50.830> a<00:02:50.890> mix<00:02:51.130> of<00:02:51.250> black<00:02:51.519> this<00:02:52.330> kind<00:02:52.690> of<00:02:53.430> almost

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
it's a mix of black this kind of almost

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.220 
it's a mix of black this kind of almost
camera<00:02:54.970> green<00:02:55.209> I<00:02:55.360> suppose<00:02:55.600> it<00:02:55.720> would<00:02:55.810> be<00:02:55.959> kind

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
camera green I suppose it would be kind

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.250 
camera green I suppose it would be kind
of<00:02:56.260> a<00:02:56.350> light<00:02:56.590> green<00:02:57.580> and<00:02:57.849> the<00:02:58.840> kind<00:02:59.019> of<00:02:59.080> light

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
of a light green and the kind of light

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.259 
of a light green and the kind of light
blue<00:02:59.530> of<00:02:59.680> the<00:02:59.799> side<00:03:00.010> and<00:03:00.130> as<00:03:00.220> you<00:03:00.310> can<00:03:00.400> see<00:03:00.640> it's

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
blue of the side and as you can see it's

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.830 
blue of the side and as you can see it's
supposed<00:03:01.480> to<00:03:01.569> look<00:03:01.750> like<00:03:01.810> but<00:03:03.360> it<00:03:04.360> may<00:03:04.540> be<00:03:04.599> just

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
supposed to look like but it may be just

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.240 
supposed to look like but it may be just
Chancellor<00:03:05.319> or<00:03:05.380> not<00:03:05.500> but<00:03:05.620> I<00:03:05.680> think<00:03:05.769> it<00:03:06.010> looks<00:03:06.190> a

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
Chancellor or not but I think it looks a

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.309 
Chancellor or not but I think it looks a
bit<00:03:06.280> like<00:03:06.400> the<00:03:06.580> kind<00:03:06.730> of<00:03:06.849> wing<00:03:07.030> of<00:03:07.209> a<00:03:07.299> bird<00:03:07.480> and

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
bit like the kind of wing of a bird and

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:09.600 
bit like the kind of wing of a bird and
obviously<00:03:08.680> that<00:03:08.920> ties<00:03:09.160> in<00:03:09.340> with<00:03:09.400> the<00:03:09.489> main

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
obviously that ties in with the main

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.880 
obviously that ties in with the main
sponsor<00:03:10.000> which<00:03:10.090> is<00:03:10.239> a<00:03:10.420> flak<00:03:10.720> there's<00:03:11.560> logo

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
sponsor which is a flak there's logo

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.039 
sponsor which is a flak there's logo
which<00:03:12.069> is<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:12.400> dark<00:03:12.640> obviously<00:03:13.120> as<00:03:13.870> we've

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
which is the dark obviously as we've

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:15.509 
which is the dark obviously as we've
already<00:03:14.140> heard<00:03:14.380> of<00:03:14.620> on<00:03:14.739> previous<00:03:15.069> NASCAR

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
already heard of on previous NASCAR

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.310 
already heard of on previous NASCAR
broadcasts<00:03:16.150> I<00:03:16.299> used<00:03:16.870> to<00:03:16.959> bring<00:03:17.109> up<00:03:17.230> that

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
broadcasts I used to bring up that

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.060 
broadcasts I used to bring up that
bloody<00:03:17.620> duck<00:03:17.890> nearly<00:03:18.220> all<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.430> time<00:03:18.640> anyway

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
bloody duck nearly all the time anyway

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.650 
bloody duck nearly all the time anyway
yeah<00:03:21.070> that's<00:03:21.489> chancel<00:03:21.970> not<00:03:22.090> that<00:03:22.269> they<00:03:22.359> design

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
yeah that's chancel not that they design

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.810 
yeah that's chancel not that they design
it<00:03:22.690> to<00:03:22.810> make<00:03:22.930> it<00:03:23.049> look<00:03:23.230> like<00:03:23.350> a<00:03:23.410> wing<00:03:23.680> and<00:03:23.890> also

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
it to make it look like a wing and also

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.340 
it to make it look like a wing and also
you<00:03:24.880> see<00:03:25.209> it<00:03:25.329> almost<00:03:25.540> reversed<00:03:25.900> on<00:03:26.109> the<00:03:26.200> back

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
you see it almost reversed on the back

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.410 
you see it almost reversed on the back
here<00:03:26.709> so<00:03:26.859> it's<00:03:27.280> the<00:03:27.370> black<00:03:27.579> going<00:03:28.090> into<00:03:28.329> the

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
here so it's the black going into the

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.530 
here so it's the black going into the
green<00:03:28.630> on<00:03:28.810> the<00:03:28.900> back<00:03:29.250> it's<00:03:30.250> a<00:03:30.280> very<00:03:30.489> nice<00:03:30.670> very

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
green on the back it's a very nice very

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.509 
green on the back it's a very nice very
