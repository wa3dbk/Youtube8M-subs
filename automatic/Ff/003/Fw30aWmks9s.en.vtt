00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.830
 Hello everyone, today I propose you it is not art 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.140
 for new year 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.560
 I don't know if he has seen himself well but he wants to do it 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.050
 I'm sick of a terrible sore throat 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.550
 I particularly like the result 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.400
 as much as I love the combination 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.260
 of gold together with dark purple and a 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.110
 very warm purple indeed curtains 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.540
 slightly to the wine color I have it 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.660
 made using uv gel because 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.030
 I had just finished making films and films 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.710
 file file 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.350
 anyway I think it's very feasible 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.420
 even with enamels if you click here 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.220
 this note you will find the link to 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.080
 you speak of it precisely and where you see link 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.000
 one that on the website bomprezzi store 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.890
 my mom was a lot 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.019
 flickering because I did everything with 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.540
 left hand but I hope anyway 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:02.159
 result I may like it 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.409
 now I leave you the tutorial a kiss a 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:05.940
 everyone has happy holidays 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.390
 first we need to create a gel 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:13.470
 golden we will need some glitter 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.590
 just gild a gel 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.010
 really very little mascoli serves 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.010
 glitter 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.430
 this is the fact is a color is 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.430
 very beautifull 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.200
 and I do a single color on all the 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:40.630
 nails I remind you that the colored gel does 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.520
 damage is very thin you do 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.409
 polymerize then if you want to give more 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.219
 opaque always make you pass 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:51.149
 thin between the other pasta 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:53.740
 it is sufficient to polymerize 30 40 seconds 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.899
 just don't mind if they are 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.630
 very slow but I'm doing everything with the 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:00.579
 left hand and I'm not left handed 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.950
 so I have to do things carefully if 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:03.939
 not Slavic but now that I've finished too 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.709
 the second past I did 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:09.640
 polymerize obviously for two minutes 

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:11.769
 abundant and the color does not degrease 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.870
 never come a spot for one now 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:16.959
 quite thin tip is ours already 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.459
 glitter I have done is 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.530
 practically doubles is a species 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.530
 of decoration with this eroded brit gel 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.400
 before the frost expands too much 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:48.950
 let's make them deserve 30 seconds 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.439
 similar but always abstract decoration there 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:55.459
 I also fly 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:56.780
 now then mary jeanne that this for 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.349
 call gold also in the others 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.569
 nails I will use this sort of 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.129
 these are practically squares 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.200
 of the bomprezzi store 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.849
 this year so thin that yes 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.219
 can use with gel but 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:12.500
 especially also with enamels vi 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:15.260
 here I put the link where I talk about it better 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.060
 and to fix them just put a little bit 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.079
 of transparent gel where we want them 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.079
 position me 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.090
 and now we do animalized for two months 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.220
 now feel it well with some gel 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.950
 transparent I make two polymerize 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.400
 minutes and then I will also give a pasta dei 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.400
 bot
