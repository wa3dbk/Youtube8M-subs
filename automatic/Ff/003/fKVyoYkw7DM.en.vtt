00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.879
 hello friends of the movie welcome to 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.830
 dvd criticism and for all horror shockers 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:09.809
 movie fans of rack or paranormal 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.130
 activity is now a film is in 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.780
 the sale of trying both a 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.920
 little to combine and that's it 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.920
 today around grave encounters 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.619
 Grave encounters is from 2011 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.059
 and goes 95 minutes tells the 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.739
 story of a camera crew the 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.300
 actually a normal way a series 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.150
 filmed with the name grave encounters 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.980
 one tries to find there later too 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.720
 It then takes up measuring instruments and 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.250
 and tries to find out if 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.030
 it is really good but actually 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.129
 that does not matter 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.050
 sense of the thing is one of his 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.269
 Season to produce the every succession 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.620
 a little scary acts and if the 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:54.690
 Camera makes you think about it 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.949
 funny as doom actually the format 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.420
 But that's what the audience is looking for 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.799
 fall in while everyone is in front of the 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.940
 Camera will be paid for it or 

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:01.379
 bribed that they have any 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.390
 Invent or act as stories 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.309
 they would be a medium year and thus 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.530
 this format is at least the 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.939
 first few follow until it comes in a row 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.159
 She takes her to a place 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.390
 former psychiatric center is 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.650
 or a former closed 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.750
 psychiatric institution 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.460
 and there they want to be completely normal 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.770
 keep turning but there it comes 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.780
 really to strange events and 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.670
 especially that this psychiatry she 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.920
 do not want to let out of their clutches 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.570
 and that reminds me a little bit 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.939
 rec a house from which you can not get out 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.950
 comes and we see a lot of people in the night 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.659
 Cameras have also reminded it back in 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.920
 paranormal activity and that is why 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.899
 strong on that a little bit the 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.359
 combination from bavaria could be just for 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.280
 fans of these two formats so great 

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:42.990
 his and one or the other comes up 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.030
 its costs but unfortunately the film comes 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.079
 with too little shock therefore and 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.310
 I think you have the right one too 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.990
 argue because that must be the 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.060
 its main task of such films to 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.590
 frighten and wherein one dry 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.060
 but above all this ego-shooter 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.460
 Mode has the whole thing is also in the 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.579
 found footage format shot as well 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.170
 genre typical is very much on tension 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.909
 made you sit so elia man am 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.990
 TV sits on blu-ray again and again 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.159
 This is the shock of my god too 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.020
 now it's about the corner now looks around 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.910
 the corner what is the tub then what 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.350
 is there in the closet very much the boogie 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.970
 And the film also holds one 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.800
 or other small surprise ready 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.260
 and that's why it's not bad at all 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.430
 but God does not know how great 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.140
 his role models 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.520
 you have to be completely honest 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.230
 this place is cinematic is the 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.180
 film is the hamburger playful 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.280
 is that okay and actually the 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.110
 almost abstruse scenes are piling up 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.030
 actually only so towards the end of the film 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.440
 really strong and the film needs a 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.540
 little to get into the ride 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.330
 the whole thing seems like you are somewhere 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.380
 an interface between 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.180
 documentary and found the this 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.010
 footage horror shocker movie for everyone 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.320
 genre films but the film is quite 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.910
 surely a must be because there is so much 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.140
 It just is not new to the market 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.060
 this direction except that paranormal 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.100
 Activity 4 will start in the cinema soon 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.650
 so this is a good jumper 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.209
 and not a really bad movie though 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.800
 Every genre is affected in total 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.570
 It looks quite different from how you look at it 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.670
 Men's rating looks good for me 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.560
 because this movie as a horror shocker 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.700
 movie still acceptable six by 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.950
 ten possible points 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.870
 in total compared to all films of this 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.370
 world no movie you have seen 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.470
 It does not have to be crafted now 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.780
 are made terrific then that 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.370
 three and a half out of 10 possible points 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.330
 have you already seen the film but me 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.830
 do not even know if at all a cinema 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.390
 Otherwise you will have release 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.610
 look at them or buy the 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.870
 I'm interested today that 's it or 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.310
 from me for today you click that 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.540
 By the way , no trailer here 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.130
 bad and i can do you too 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.600
 say it probably will 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.640
 expect this movie a raffle because 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.769
 I have more than just a copy of it 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.260
 only sad thing is that here 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.540
 actually the movie with advertising with it 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.310
 that makes it over 23 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.220
 million trailer clicks on youtube and 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.350
 whoever makes such pr with youtube there has to 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.640
 then you ask yourself a bit if 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.350
 the film can do so much 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.690
 okay that's it really from me 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.130
 for this morning and 15 new review and 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.170
 Until then, I hope you are you too 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.170
 of course again at 3
