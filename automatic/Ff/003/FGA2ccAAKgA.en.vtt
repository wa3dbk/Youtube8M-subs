00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:06.359
 hey people the galaxy s 6 is the best 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.370
 smartphone the samsung ever made 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.090
 has why that is so you see in 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.540
 this video 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.540
 have fun 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.960
 the list of things samsung with 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.540
 this year's smartphone generation 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.460
 has done right is long but the 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.830
 first point on this list is that 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.240
 design the galaxy s way puts forward and 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.800
 on the back of a glass of one 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.689
 metal frame is edged and this 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.759
 composition leads to a solid 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.460
 and feeling in the hand no 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.110
 No scratching the galaxy s 6 is plastic 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.030
 I 'll just be in my black 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.829
 sapphire variant changes depending on 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.470
 light even the color of black 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:43.750
 to a cool blue the display of the 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.730
 galaxy s 6 is the best on the market 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.820
 Honestly, it's just insane 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.559
 The 5.1 inch super amoled panel ensures 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.210
 For brilliant colors the two are saturated 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:53.920
 but not supersaturated 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.899
 of course a perfect black value 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.550
 good white values â€‹â€‹is even outside 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:59.710
 has to read for a great 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:03.070
 Amoled display is great viewing angle and is 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:06.160
 with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.150
 pixeln at a pixel density of 576 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.430
 pixel per inch 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.750
 sharp everything that only on this 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.240
 display power just looks stunning 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.310
 from just as stunning see the 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.090
 Pictures taken with the galaxy s 6 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.189
 can shoot 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.869
 the main camera solves with 16 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:21.759
 megapixel and the front camera with 5 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:23.049
 megapixels on and the results 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.850
 speak for themselves because of the high 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.650
 dynamic range the sharpness of the 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.900
 natural colors and the iris of 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.610
 1.9 does a fantastic job 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.799
 In addition, the software is so good that you 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.479
 Almost always at the first try exactly that 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.579
 photo that you wanted 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.259
 And besides, the small aperture ensures 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:41.020
 a nice bokeh so a sharper 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.909
 background and the 4k video feature is 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.860
 really really awesome because everything 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.290
 in the photos it is good that it is also on the 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.329
 video mode is good and 4k is just like that 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.229
 nice and sharp and the smartphone is 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:52.149
 really good 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.920
 In terms of technology , samsung goes for it 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:57.240
 year the galaxy is built own ways 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.350
 s 6 namely from samsung's own exynos 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.180
 7,420 octa core processor 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.829
 but it seems damn good 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.840
 because in combination with the three 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:07.270
 gigabyte ram the device is running so fast 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.280
 how to play schmidt's cat surfing 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.200
 chat tweets and so on 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.640
 Buttery and really let print 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.130
 the greatest rarity 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.180
 as a system currently comes android 5.0 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.950
 point 2 for use 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.690
 about which samsung its touchwiz 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.490
 touchwiz is still there 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.230
 colorful and brings some ugly ones 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.840
 with itself is meanwhile again 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.129
 playful yet overloaded still unstable 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.650
 the user is still using samsung 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:31.450
 features are stuffed and that's it in 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.340
 my eyes no negative aspect more 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.319
 especially the design with lounge and so on 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.920
 continue to be easily adapted 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.959
 can 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.849
 the touchwiz own multivendor feature 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.530
 is even really useful and I'm happy 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.390
 me on every samsung test device on 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.580
 new about this cool and right 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.450
 useful features around it at the same time 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.120
 to be able to use 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.080
 The galaxy s 6 news is led 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.640
 By the way, very cool 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.780
 the speaker on absolutely good 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.459
 Level of fingerprint sensor 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.530
 finally works like at 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.239
 So once iphone tap it and 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:02.019
 device unlocks the memory of 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:04.150
 alternatively 32 64 or 128 gb is unfortunately 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.650
 was not further and the battery is 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.510
 no longer changeable but completely honest 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.370
 almost no one needs that 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.110
 the battery on the way, keeps a good 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.269
 he does not have day beyond, however 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.430
 but a little disappointed the choice 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.060
 a socket in the evening is so 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.040
 mandatory 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.480
 samsung has something with the galaxy s 6 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.340
 special created and indeed one 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.590
 smartphone where you do not have anything big 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.299
 a smartphone can almost criticize that 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.040
 is perfect and does almost everything right 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:29.140
 what can be done right 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.940
 the design is great the display of 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.069
 overkill the camera fantastic the 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.840
 Technology software and performance is 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.940
 great and the battery is completely 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.560
 satisfactory the galaxy s 6 is 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.389
 So that's an outstanding smartphone 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.459
 that i can only recommend it is in 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:44.920
 Four colors available and on Amazon 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.959
 just for just 620 euros to have the 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.250
 is not cheap but the price will be 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.410
 sink and is in my eyes too 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.569
 fairly reasonably a link too 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.430
 so amazon for her down in the 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.709
 description as well as left as a 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.389
