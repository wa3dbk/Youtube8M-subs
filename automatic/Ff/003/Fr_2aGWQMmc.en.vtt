 new video from basware farc today I'm going to 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.529
 comment a pretty curious fact 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.019
 we could say the other day michael 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.150
 gondry was tweeting what the 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.740
 apas best weapons depending warfare 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.719
 how the people were in the games 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.740
 what does this mean, here is the 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:22.230
 tweet with the top 5 x 160 the panzer this 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.359
 weapon is awesome I do not have it anymore 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.949
 he could touch me in the 230 supplies 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.080
 advanced to open but I do not have 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.210
 I just caught him a little bit sometimes 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.570
 is on the ground and such and said oh god 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.090
 mine well the rx 160 hold panzer is the 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.620
 weapon with which on average all 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.450
 players that juana step alpha in all 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.550
 the platforms are better in the 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.070
 games that is the best weapon 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.140
 proportion low deaths has everything 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.760
 the game we could say to be better 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.620
 perfectly good weapon we go to the 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.969
 final the group piatek this is 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.500
 precisely the weapon that the other day 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.780
 You saw a fierce with the white info 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.690
 3 then we have endorsement 27 that is 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.210
 pique good you know I do not have it 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.699
 and then we have the insanity chéveres 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.100
 you want to see 1,357 times in the channel 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.900
 really not so many but yes that's good 6 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.630
 that I have it and used it a thousand times and 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.270
 then we have the mel and heavy once 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.040
 use the sub pour but the heavy mili 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.259
 is in second place you could say 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.729
 which is the second best weapon in the game 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.940
 depending on how people are in the 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:25.240
 games and today we are going to see really if 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.759
 that weapon deserves that position the beast 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.009
 is and here you have the class that I wear 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.810
 this nanotechnology that is very ugly 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.979
 but good as I never put it then 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.110
 maybe I'll put it on and go to 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:38.140
 check that because this weapon is in 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.210
 second place really what beast that is 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.190
 so nothing we go to the game ok ya 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.140
 we're here solar duel the team 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.850
 only and this map when the gusts say 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.649
 kill you is that you really 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.110
 of control and can be armed here one 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:51.970
 plane or here with the people that this is going to 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.259
 be very very heavy precisely the case 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.670
 of these are the accessories that I'm going to 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.560
 Bring with the heavy hand mili 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.210
 unsheathed and large boots is 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.100
 raising the idea of putting fire on 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.200
 fast but I say if that is already like 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.649
 accept what is tight so 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.649
 that the player 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.980
 the fact is that it is quite good because 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:17.260
 when they are not full you never know no 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.260
 we are six against six never good 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.040
 and he burst his head uncle 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.650
 impressive that has been very 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.650
 awesome kid sank there 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:39.860
 of this life has the purpose of 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:43.220
 show you why the skillful and heavy that 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.080
 occupy the blind host you are disoriented 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.870
 because he deserves it and occupies the second 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.520
 place in that top of the arms with the 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.710
 what better were the players of 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.600
 apanás warfare has that purpose and what 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.870
 You are going to see what I will demonstrate 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.340
 place 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.659
 and I was looking for it and the yo 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.829
 behind you have to take advantage of this map 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:01.389
 really kid is that if I took a 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.780
 drone on this map is already out of control 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:06.420
 everything is going all the shit they kill here 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.370
 much the gusts in alone when they want 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.510
 so that is worth seeing I saw you explaining 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.639
 why this weapon is in second place 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.189
 basically manage badly that kills 

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:17.409
 three bullets at any distance and that 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:19.050
 that I just mentioned is something very 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:20.340
 billet 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.140
 that is, for a weapon to kill three 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.760
 bullets from any distance is a weapon 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.740
 very tied vale vale is getting 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.350
 pretty the game for everyone and killing 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.780
 bloodthirsty began to do here 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.490
 precisely the case and other media that 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.870
 Kills three bullets at any distance 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.530
 with which you already raised a live on your 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.630
 time and in george villages if it does not fail me 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.100
 the memory is the sub milli pour kills 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.990
 three bullets at any distance also 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.390
 the problem you have is a great weapon 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.160
 handicap is that it removes two dots of 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.780
 clear charger and that fucks your life 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.760
 because you put it extended chargers 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.490
 put in the shit and still I think that 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.780
 has 75 bullets is armed this weapon or 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.070
 nothing and not the one that I just hit for 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.670
 get me the perfect drone that goes 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.670
 supported richer 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.880
 perfect 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.349
 it is very much worth going to throw the 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:09.640
 guard see I still have bullets and for 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.110
 do against here and now I comment on 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.400
 issue of super ter because the game 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.010
 It's getting very cool stone 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.450
 throne here is as if you will become a god 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.910
 up there because that you'll see how 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.680
 they kill in the first lowered other mega 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.230
 run of 15 we go there care that 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.150
 I'm out of bullets this I've put 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.530
 groba scavenger I just need that I 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:31.260
 I have bullets here to stop a train 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.260
 also with heat is expanded in the past 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:39.010
 the supertel drops two dots of 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.010
 charger and that's crap 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.780
 this is what I tell you about the gusts 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.690
 amazing 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:50.110
 Uncle Fuck Young Assures As Not With the 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.110
 assistant 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.010
 look how it's killing the gusts is that 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.230
 normal nani there we are the weapon that 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.910
 occupies the second place on the top 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.800
 this kills as a series is very 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.300
 impressive climb up here to see if 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.590
 we caught this man hello that such 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.300
 question of steel bike that carries this 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.220
 list and the color rosita you have good 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.840
 accuracy with this weapon and you become 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.310
 automatically in the god of apan sugar 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.030
 far care in the game goes by 50 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:19.340
 low is still enough is that this 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.020
 he hit me really is a subscriber if 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.970
 is that if he had not hit me with a punch 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.870
 without meaning I say it can not be that there is a 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.150
 enemy I think I'm seeing it 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.770
 punches for I'm surprised life nothing 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:30.550
 it's subscribers you really want to 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.550
 can play calm 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:46.990
 here enough back 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:53.770
 the truth 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.120
 uy a naval rod to a bullet plus miss 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.270
 if I had not turned in plan 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:00.219
 padlock would have killed it would have killed 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:02.050
 There is hood and we are shitting but we are going to 

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:03.789
 get to 40 casualties to see if we go to 40 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.129
 low baba potato daddy I'm left four 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:10.870
 and that gives time to spare uncle was time 

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:13.280
 to spare we're going to 40 perfect grave falls 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.080
 3 remain 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.400
 two 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.400
 but my 40 casualties 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:27.610
 the effect on removed is taken that 

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:27.610
 distance as close 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:38.789
 I want to get the perfect 8 and the 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:40.710
 we have guys should try to leave a 

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:42.300
 flame comes out a falling we know the case 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:44.189
 let's try to finish the game with 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.810
 good foot without being too upset 

00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:47.849
 I hope not to die trying to have the 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:50.009
 departure without dying Augustine antimatter 

00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:52.289
 up there, it's worth noting that eviction 

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:53.759
 I was really punching 

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:55.889
 is that sometimes because it bothers you 

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:58.370
 a little play this way not the 

00:06:55.889 --> 00:06:58.370
 last low 

00:06:58.409 --> 00:07:01.069
 we do not do it 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.750
 we will not see is going to be a little 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.970
 regrettable 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:09.460
 with more fear a bad level of less evil 

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:11.080
 we will not end the case 

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:12.280
 horned how many times in a way that 

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.560
 I did not explain myself because I was 

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:16.900
 hitting my side is a 41 5 this is a 

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:18.640
 last guys told us the mel and super 

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.050
 Ceres contains the same damage as this weapon 

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.310
 kills three bullets but has the great 

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.720
 gay handicap that you take away the 

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:24.760
 charger dots and stays in the 

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.350
 borrowed shit is it takes away driving and 

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.720
 it's a cheat that you flip and for that reason 

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:31.210
 which is in second place in that top 

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:33.700
 to line when I touch the rx golf 

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:35.020
 to be really is that it is very much 

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.280
 you better touch the rusty I'm 

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.870
 many people do not know because it is a 

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:39.669
 professional dam the youngest weapon of the 

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:41.410
 judged from a burst with a cadence 

00:07:39.669 --> 00:07:42.580
 bestial is awesome but good 

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:44.470

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:49.120
 still and how you kill me with that weapon for 

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.860
