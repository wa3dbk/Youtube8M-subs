00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:01.530 
I think my biggest crowd ever was a

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.439 
I think my biggest crowd ever was a
hundred<00:00:01.979> thousand<00:00:02.490> people<00:00:02.610> I<00:00:03.000> mean<00:00:03.300> it's

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
hundred thousand people I mean it's

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.420 
hundred thousand people I mean it's
amazing<00:00:03.689> that<00:00:04.110> energy<00:00:04.470> is<00:00:04.560> like<00:00:04.680> undeniable

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
but I think it's an overall better

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.560 
but I think it's an overall better
experience<00:00:08.670> when<00:00:08.880> you<00:00:08.970> can<00:00:09.150> kind<00:00:09.360> of<00:00:09.420> be
