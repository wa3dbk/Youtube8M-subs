I'm<00:00:17.190> Mary<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:18.029> I'm<00:00:18.779> here<00:00:19.260> again<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.830> show<00:00:20.189> you

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
I'm Mary and I'm here again to show you

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.820 
I'm Mary and I'm here again to show you
how<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.240> cope<00:00:21.689> with<00:00:23.300> patching<00:00:24.350> outer<00:00:25.350> and

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
how to cope with patching outer and

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.330 
how to cope with patching outer and
inner<00:00:26.189> curves<00:00:26.910> on<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.630> shape<00:00:27.960> now<00:00:28.320> I<00:00:28.680> think<00:00:29.130> a

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
inner curves on a shape now I think a

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.370 
inner curves on a shape now I think a
lot<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.519> people<00:00:30.029> have<00:00:30.210> been<00:00:30.449> pretty<00:00:30.779> daunted

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
lot of people have been pretty daunted

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.170 
lot of people have been pretty daunted
by<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.650> sort<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.160> coping<00:00:32.640> with<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.820> curved

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
by the sort of coping with a curved

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.000 
by the sort of coping with a curved
shape<00:00:33.420> particularly<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.350> geometric

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
shape particularly the geometric

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.130 
shape particularly the geometric
repeating<00:00:35.579> ones<00:00:35.820> because<00:00:36.239> they<00:00:36.390> think<00:00:36.930> oh

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
repeating ones because they think oh

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.500 
repeating ones because they think oh
it's<00:00:37.890> gonna<00:00:38.129> be<00:00:38.309> really<00:00:38.520> hard<00:00:38.879> it's<00:00:39.239> gonna<00:00:39.360> be

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
it's gonna be really hard it's gonna be

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.860 
it's gonna be really hard it's gonna be
really<00:00:39.750> complicated<00:00:40.370> and<00:00:41.370> so<00:00:41.610> they<00:00:41.870> might

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
really complicated and so they might

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.139 
really complicated and so they might
stick<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.530> security<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.489> nice<00:00:44.700> straight

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
stick to the security of a nice straight

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.100 
stick to the security of a nice straight
edged<00:00:45.480> piece<00:00:45.899> like<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.620> hexagons<00:00:47.190> but

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
edged piece like the hexagons but

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.869 
edged piece like the hexagons but
there's<00:00:49.110> something<00:00:49.469> rather<00:00:49.649> beautiful<00:00:50.340> about

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
there's something rather beautiful about

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.750 
there's something rather beautiful about
coping<00:00:51.390> with<00:00:51.570> curves<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:53.219> think<00:00:53.579> once

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
coping with curves and I think once

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.540 
coping with curves and I think once
you've<00:00:54.059> got<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.420> hang<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:55.370> you're<00:00:56.370> going

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
you've got the hang of it you're going

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.180 
you've got the hang of it you're going
to<00:00:56.699> really<00:00:56.969> really<00:00:57.270> enjoy<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.800> so<00:00:58.800> let's<00:00:59.010> get

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
to really really enjoy it so let's get

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.529 
to really really enjoy it so let's get
working<00:00:59.370> I'm<00:00:59.640> going<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.969> show<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.149> how<00:01:00.510> to

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
working I'm going to show you how to

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.619 
working I'm going to show you how to

techniques that most people who used to

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.469 
techniques that most people who used to

familiar<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.680> clam<00:01:13.950> shape<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.820> repeating

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
familiar the clam shape is a repeating

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.950 
familiar the clam shape is a repeating
geometric<00:01:15.869> shape<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.920> it's<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:18.119> very<00:01:18.659> good

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
geometric shape and it's a very good

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.560 
geometric shape and it's a very good
practice<00:01:19.380> piece<00:01:20.040> for<00:01:20.939> beginning<00:01:21.270> to

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
practice piece for beginning to

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.950 
practice piece for beginning to
understand<00:01:22.110> curves<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:23.460> reason<00:01:23.790> being<00:01:24.000> it's

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
understand curves the reason being it's

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.320 
understand curves the reason being it's
got<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.170> curve<00:01:25.530> on<00:01:25.860> this<00:01:26.100> side<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:26.430> goes<00:01:26.970> in

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
got a curve on this side that goes in

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.429 
got a curve on this side that goes in
and<00:01:27.600> has<00:01:28.110> gotten<00:01:28.380> out<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.799> curve<00:01:29.340> here<00:01:30.350> so<00:01:31.350> you

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
and has gotten out a curve here so you

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.310 
and has gotten out a curve here so you
can<00:01:31.650> really<00:01:32.390> understand<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.720> get<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.110> grips

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
can really understand and get to grips

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.270 
can really understand and get to grips
with<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.680> on<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.979> very<00:01:35.250> simple<00:01:35.640> format<00:01:37.250> okay

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
with it on a very simple format okay

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.609 
with it on a very simple format okay
we're<00:01:38.549> ready<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:39.030> attach<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.450> fabric<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.530> the

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
we're ready to attach the fabric to the

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.160 
we're ready to attach the fabric to the
card<00:01:40.920> template<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:43.369> listen<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.520> this<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:45.180> pin

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
card template and listen to this and pin

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.690 
card template and listen to this and pin
it<00:01:46.320> securely<00:01:46.799> in<00:01:47.040> place

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.200 

because<00:01:52.700> this<00:01:52.880> is<00:01:53.090> an<00:01:53.240> odd<00:01:53.450> shape<00:01:54.910> we<00:01:55.910> need<00:01:56.090> to

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
because this is an odd shape we need to

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:05.260 
because this is an odd shape we need to
secure<00:01:56.600> this<00:01:56.810> end<00:01:59.410> another<00:02:00.410> pin<00:02:00.770> in<00:02:00.950> there<00:02:04.270> and

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
secure this end another pin in there and

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.550 
secure this end another pin in there and
you<00:02:05.360> will<00:02:05.450> notice<00:02:05.630> that<00:02:05.900> I've<00:02:06.080> got<00:02:06.110> these

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
you will notice that I've got these

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.790 
you will notice that I've got these
already<00:02:06.860> cut<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:08.270> idea<00:02:08.630> is<00:02:08.869> that<00:02:09.080> you<00:02:09.289> create

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
already cut the idea is that you create

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.080 
already cut the idea is that you create
an<00:02:10.160> ease<00:02:11.050> for<00:02:12.050> the<00:02:12.110> fabric<00:02:12.500> when<00:02:12.620> it<00:02:12.740> Ferb's

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
an ease for the fabric when it Ferb's

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.680 
an ease for the fabric when it Ferb's
the<00:02:14.090> curves<00:02:14.420> over<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:15.020> inside<00:02:15.560> curve<00:02:16.490> and<00:02:16.850> it

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
the curves over the inside curve and it

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.100 
the curves over the inside curve and it
just<00:02:18.250> snip<00:02:19.250> it<00:02:19.280> down<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.730> edge<00:02:19.760> but<00:02:20.209> not<00:02:20.510> right

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
just snip it down the edge but not right

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.910 
just snip it down the edge but not right
up<00:02:21.350> to<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:22.570> cardboard<00:02:23.590> otherwise<00:02:24.590> when<00:02:24.890> you

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
up to the cardboard otherwise when you

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.990 
up to the cardboard otherwise when you
turn<00:02:25.700> that<00:02:25.880> over<00:02:26.510> and<00:02:26.780> you<00:02:27.050> go<00:02:27.230> to<00:02:27.290> sew<00:02:27.680> it<00:02:28.000> if

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
turn that over and you go to sew it if

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.940 
turn that over and you go to sew it if
that<00:02:29.090> comes<00:02:29.840> right<00:02:30.140> up<00:02:30.350> to<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:30.620> edge<00:02:30.709> of<00:02:30.890> the

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
that comes right up to the edge of the

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.860 
that comes right up to the edge of the
card<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:31.520> whole<00:02:31.550> thing<00:02:31.970> will<00:02:32.120> tear<00:02:32.390> and<00:02:32.690> not

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
card the whole thing will tear and not

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.360 
card the whole thing will tear and not
look<00:02:33.080> very<00:02:33.110> good<00:02:33.560> see<00:02:34.520> that<00:02:34.760> little<00:02:35.060> bit<00:02:35.209> there

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
look very good see that little bit there

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:42.820 
look very good see that little bit there
okay<00:02:37.370> right<00:02:38.560> you<00:02:39.560> will<00:02:39.739> need<00:02:41.620> tacking<00:02:42.620> thread

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
okay right you will need tacking thread

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
okay right you will need tacking thread
needle<00:02:43.610> and<00:02:43.760> a<00:02:44.630> knot<00:02:44.870> on<00:02:45.110> the<00:02:45.440> end<00:02:45.850> you're

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
needle and a knot on the end you're

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.970 
needle and a knot on the end you're
going<00:02:47.060> to<00:02:47.209> put<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.600> knot<00:02:47.810> on<00:02:49.989> the<00:02:50.989> other<00:02:51.260> side

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
going to put the knot on the other side

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.580 
going to put the knot on the other side
the<00:02:52.520> opposite<00:02:52.940> side<00:02:53.239> because<00:02:53.810> when<00:02:54.050> you<00:02:54.260> fold

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
the opposite side because when you fold

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.160 
the opposite side because when you fold
this<00:02:54.860> over<00:02:55.180> and<00:02:56.180> you<00:02:56.330> come<00:02:56.540> to<00:02:56.690> take<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:56.989> knot

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
this over and you come to take the knot

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.229 
this over and you come to take the knot
out<00:02:57.200> it<00:02:57.680> will<00:02:57.799> then<00:02:58.010> be<00:02:58.220> on<00:02:58.250> the<00:02:58.580> outside<00:02:59.000> and

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
out it will then be on the outside and

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.190 
out it will then be on the outside and
convenient<00:02:59.900> for<00:03:00.140> you<00:03:00.290> so<00:03:00.730> I<00:03:01.730> put<00:03:02.060> them<00:03:02.239> not<00:03:02.959> in

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
convenient for you so I put them not in

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.250 
convenient for you so I put them not in
and<00:03:03.830> you're<00:03:04.549> going<00:03:04.730> to<00:03:04.940> stitch<00:03:05.269> about<00:03:05.989> halfway

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
and you're going to stitch about halfway

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.550 
and you're going to stitch about halfway
between<00:03:06.620> the<00:03:07.130> outer<00:03:07.519> edge<00:03:07.940> and<00:03:08.209> the<00:03:08.510> card<00:03:08.810> so

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
between the outer edge and the card so

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.160 
between the outer edge and the card so
it's<00:03:09.680> just<00:03:09.860> a<00:03:09.980> simple<00:03:10.420> tacking<00:03:11.420> stitch<00:03:11.750> right

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
it's just a simple tacking stitch right

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.590 
it's just a simple tacking stitch right
the<00:03:12.350> way<00:03:12.500> along<00:03:13.280> don't<00:03:13.910> have<00:03:14.150> to<00:03:14.299> be<00:03:14.390> too

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
the way along don't have to be too

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:26.570 
the way along don't have to be too
precious<00:03:14.930> about<00:03:15.260> this

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.550 

you'll<00:03:27.580> find<00:03:27.910> that<00:03:28.450> the<00:03:28.630> size<00:03:28.900> of<00:03:29.110> the<00:03:29.260> stitch

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
you'll find that the size of the stitch

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.360 
you'll find that the size of the stitch
will<00:03:29.860> vary<00:03:30.160> according<00:03:31.060> to<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.980> size<00:03:32.980> of<00:03:33.250> the

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
will vary according to the size of the

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.820 
will vary according to the size of the
curve<00:03:35.700> that<00:03:36.700> you're<00:03:36.970> making<00:03:37.480> so<00:03:38.110> the<00:03:38.380> practice

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
curve that you're making so the practice

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.980 
curve that you're making so the practice
makes<00:03:39.100> perfect<00:03:39.400> on<00:03:39.790> this<00:03:39.970> one<00:03:42.750> when<00:03:43.750> you<00:03:43.840> get

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:43.990 
makes perfect on this one when you get

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.300 
makes perfect on this one when you get
to<00:03:44.140> the<00:03:44.230> end<00:03:46.200> when<00:03:47.200> you<00:03:47.290> go<00:03:47.380> to<00:03:47.440> the<00:03:47.620> end<00:03:47.770> you'll

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
to the end when you go to the end you'll

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.920 
to the end when you go to the end you'll
want<00:03:48.700> to<00:03:48.820> secure<00:03:50.310> the<00:03:51.310> far<00:03:51.580> end<00:03:51.910> over<00:03:52.600> the<00:03:52.720> end

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
want to secure the far end over the end
