00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
start now so this AKA salomon cg is the

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.440 
start now so this AKA salomon cg is the
most<00:00:31.439> upgraded<00:00:31.710> version<00:00:32.489> of<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:33.000> regular

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
most upgraded version of the regular

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.650 
most upgraded version of the regular
ak-47<00:00:34.350> extension<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.239> it<00:00:36.239> has<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.480> same

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
ak-47 extension and it has the same

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.389 
ak-47 extension and it has the same
damage<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.410> just<00:00:37.649> 33<00:00:37.920> that's<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.250> highest

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
damage so just 33 that's the highest

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.580 
damage so just 33 that's the highest
damage<00:00:38.579> in<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.940> game<00:00:39.149> I'm<00:00:39.420> not<00:00:39.960> without<00:00:40.140> any

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
damage in the game I'm not without any

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.610 
damage in the game I'm not without any
bonuses<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.219> any<00:00:41.430> type<00:00:41.670> as<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:42.989> can<00:00:43.050> see<00:00:43.230> the

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
bonuses of any type as you can see the

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.319 
bonuses of any type as you can see the
extension<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.340> says<00:00:44.610> over<00:00:44.820> here<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.149> has<00:00:45.300> a

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
extension it says over here it has a

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.540 
extension it says over here it has a
zoom<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:46.260> scope<00:00:46.530> over<00:00:46.739> here<00:00:46.950> which<00:00:47.100> helps<00:00:47.430> you

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
zoom the scope over here which helps you

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.729 
zoom the scope over here which helps you
increase<00:00:48.270> accuracy<00:00:48.809> okay<00:00:49.260> so<00:00:49.320> it's<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.590> little

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
increase accuracy okay so it's a little

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.830 
increase accuracy okay so it's a little
more<00:00:49.950> accurate<00:00:50.370> than<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.520> rest<00:00:50.840> reduced

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
more accurate than the rest reduced

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.959 
more accurate than the rest reduced
recoil<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.350> reduced<00:00:52.710> mobility<00:00:52.920> see<00:00:53.820> the

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
recoil and reduced mobility see the

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.150 
recoil and reduced mobility see the
reduced<00:00:54.300> recoil<00:00:54.480> may<00:00:55.079> be<00:00:55.140> good<00:00:55.410> for<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.739> when

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
reduced recoil may be good for you when

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.279 
reduced recoil may be good for you when
you<00:00:56.280> shoot<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:57.149> won't<00:00:57.329> it<00:00:57.660> won't<00:00:57.780> move<00:00:58.020> around

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
you shoot you won't it won't move around

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.920 
you shoot you won't it won't move around
as<00:00:58.500> much<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.920> part<00:00:59.129> yet<00:00:59.539> but<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.629> reduced

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
as much the part yet but the reduced

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.689 
as much the part yet but the reduced
mobility<00:01:01.170> that's<00:01:02.039> not<00:01:02.190> gonna<00:01:02.309> be<00:01:02.430> so<00:01:02.579> great

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
mobility that's not gonna be so great

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.429 
mobility that's not gonna be so great
for<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.239> if<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.510> somebody<00:01:03.719> like<00:01:03.870> me<00:01:04.170> was<00:01:04.409> a

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
for you so if you somebody like me was a

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.440 
for you so if you somebody like me was a
faster<00:01:04.799> character<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.700> shouldn't<00:01:06.090> bring<00:01:06.180> that

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
faster character it shouldn't bring that

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.060 
faster character it shouldn't bring that
back<00:01:06.689> down<00:01:06.869> about<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.350> regular<00:01:07.619> character

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
back down about the regular character

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.820 
back down about the regular character
and<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.790> capacity<00:01:08.939> having<00:01:09.689> 45<00:01:10.200> ammo<00:01:10.470> is

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
and the capacity having 45 ammo is

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.100 
and the capacity having 45 ammo is
pretty<00:01:11.430> good<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:12.090> mean<00:01:12.390> even<00:01:12.600> though<00:01:12.930> it's<00:01:13.049> a

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
pretty good I mean even though it's a

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.179 
pretty good I mean even though it's a
three<00:01:13.290> shot<00:01:13.439> kill<00:01:13.619> you're<00:01:13.740> gonna<00:01:13.830> be<00:01:13.950> able<00:01:14.100> to

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
three shot kill you're gonna be able to

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.940 
three shot kill you're gonna be able to
clutch<00:01:14.400> one<00:01:14.760> VA<00:01:14.970> even<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.630> have<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.229> time<00:01:16.590> to

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
clutch one VA even and have the time to

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.399 
clutch one VA even and have the time to
just<00:01:17.460> kill<00:01:17.700> everyone<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:18.240> mean<00:01:18.509> three<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.229> five

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
just kill everyone I mean three to five

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.560 
just kill everyone I mean three to five
shots<00:01:19.710> at<00:01:19.920> max<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.610> that's<00:01:21.210> if<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.420> don't

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
shots at max and that's if you don't

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.480 
shots at max and that's if you don't
have<00:01:21.659> any<00:01:21.780> bonuses<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.470> they<00:01:22.590> have<00:01:22.770> like<00:01:23.040> tank

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
have any bonuses and they have like tank

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.660 
have any bonuses and they have like tank
and<00:01:23.670> everything<00:01:24.000> so<00:01:24.840> ability<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:26.280> know<00:01:26.400> it's

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
and everything so ability is I know it's

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.760 
and everything so ability is I know it's
pretty<00:01:26.850> well<00:01:27.030> but<00:01:27.270> it's<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:28.080> good<00:01:28.229> gun<00:01:28.470> for

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
pretty well but it's a good gun for

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.200 
pretty well but it's a good gun for
damage<00:01:29.130> that's<00:01:29.400> why<00:01:29.520> they<00:01:29.670> have<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.939> ego

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
damage that's why they have the ego

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.450 
damage that's why they have the ego
everything<00:01:30.540> out<00:01:30.799> there<00:01:31.799> I<00:01:31.979> spread<00:01:32.280> and

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
everything out there I spread and

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.060 
everything out there I spread and
accuracy<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.000> low<00:01:33.240> because<00:01:33.869> being<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.470> most

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
accuracy is low because being the most

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.319 
accuracy is low because being the most
damage<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.549> have<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.700> be<00:01:35.820> able<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.090> know<00:01:36.180> how

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
damage you have to be able to know how

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.359 
damage you have to be able to know how
to<00:01:36.390> control<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:37.380> mainly<00:01:37.590> for<00:01:37.799> this<00:01:37.920> gun<00:01:38.130> I

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
to control it so mainly for this gun I

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.109 
to control it so mainly for this gun I
use<00:01:38.700> tapping<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:40.259> just<00:01:40.500> sing<00:01:41.430> use<00:01:42.090> a

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
use tapping and you just sing use a

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.990 
use tapping and you just sing use a
single<00:01:42.450> mouse<00:01:42.750> click<00:01:42.890> one<00:01:43.890> at<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.070> time<00:01:44.369> or

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
single mouse click one at a time or

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.870 
single mouse click one at a time or
rapidly<00:01:45.600> do<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:46.049> really<00:01:46.740> quickly<00:01:47.070> which<00:01:47.700> would

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
rapidly do it really quickly which would
