this<00:00:22.380> is<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.560> knife<00:00:22.859> only<00:00:23.100> Moab<00:00:23.430> beast<00:00:24.390> mode<00:00:24.689> so

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
this is a knife only Moab beast mode so

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.540 
this is a knife only Moab beast mode so
you<00:00:25.410> should<00:00:25.560> go<00:00:25.650> check<00:00:25.830> them<00:00:25.949> out<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.430> let

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
you should go check them out and let

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.800 
you should go check them out and let
them<00:00:26.699> know<00:00:26.849> what<00:00:27.000> beasts<00:00:27.449> they<00:00:27.599> are<00:00:28.010> and<00:00:29.010> I

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
them know what beasts they are and I

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.250 
them know what beasts they are and I
guess<00:00:31.520> where<00:00:32.520> do<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:32.700> start<00:00:33.059> with<00:00:33.360> money<00:00:33.600> equals

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
guess where do I start with money equals

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.760 
guess where do I start with money equals
debt<00:00:34.590> equals<00:00:35.160> slavery<00:00:36.170> so<00:00:37.170> money<00:00:37.649> is

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
debt equals slavery so money is

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.280 
debt equals slavery so money is
something<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:38.430> we<00:00:38.579> all<00:00:38.610> in<00:00:39.180> modern<00:00:39.989> times

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
something that we all in modern times

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.639 
something that we all in modern times
must<00:00:41.070> work<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:43.309> get<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.719> we<00:00:45.719> all<00:00:45.899> need<00:00:46.289> money

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
must work to get and we all need money

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.069 
must work to get and we all need money
just<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.430> feed<00:00:48.059> ourselves<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.840> clothe

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
just to feed ourselves and clothe

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.770 
just to feed ourselves and clothe
ourselves<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.800> put<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:49.980> roof<00:00:50.430> over<00:00:50.820> our<00:00:51.239> head

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
ourselves and put a roof over our head

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.490 
ourselves and put a roof over our head
and<00:00:52.489> a<00:00:53.489> lot<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.879> us<00:00:53.940> work<00:00:54.270> jobs<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:55.230> we<00:00:55.379> don't

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
and a lot of us work jobs that we don't

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.700 
and a lot of us work jobs that we don't
really<00:00:55.770> want<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.399> work<00:00:56.840> just<00:00:57.840> because<00:00:58.320> we<00:00:58.530> have

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
really want to work just because we have

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.930 
really want to work just because we have
to<00:00:58.859> pay<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.250> bills<00:00:59.280> and<00:01:01.399> and<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.579> fucking

to pay the bills and and that fucking
sucks<00:01:04.640> but<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:06.380> guess<00:01:07.380> what<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:07.979> really<00:01:08.460> wanted

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
sucks but I guess what I really wanted

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.760 
sucks but I guess what I really wanted
to<00:01:08.700> bring<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.030> your<00:01:09.150> attention<00:01:09.299> is<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.380> where

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
to bring to your attention is is where

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.490 
to bring to your attention is is where
money<00:01:11.729> actually<00:01:12.170> comes<00:01:13.170> from<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:15.020> it<00:01:16.020> used<00:01:16.350> to

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
money actually comes from and it used to

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.969 
money actually comes from and it used to
be<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.830> money<00:01:17.130> was<00:01:17.400> backed<00:01:17.759> on<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.979> gold

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
be that money was backed on a gold

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.270 
be that money was backed on a gold
standard<00:01:20.240> or<00:01:21.240> silver<00:01:21.960> or<00:01:22.170> precious<00:01:22.619> metals

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
standard or silver or precious metals

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.980 
standard or silver or precious metals
because<00:01:23.970> they're<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.450> finite<00:01:24.960> resource

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
because they're a finite resource

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.289 
because they're a finite resource
there's<00:01:25.680> only<00:01:25.830> so<00:01:26.159> much<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.580> them<00:01:26.759> so<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.030> kept

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
there's only so much of them so it kept

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.690 
there's only so much of them so it kept
the<00:01:27.450> money<00:01:27.570> supply<00:01:27.950> under<00:01:28.950> control<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:29.670> that

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
the money supply under control so that

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.120 
the money supply under control so that
people<00:01:30.420> couldn't<00:01:30.720> just<00:01:30.990> create<00:01:31.350> money<00:01:31.560> out<00:01:31.829> of

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
people couldn't just create money out of

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.289 
people couldn't just create money out of
thin<00:01:32.310> air<00:01:32.610> but<00:01:33.540> in<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.840> 70s<00:01:34.170> we<00:01:35.000> detached<00:01:36.000> our

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
thin air but in the 70s we detached our

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.380 
thin air but in the 70s we detached our
money<00:01:36.509> supply<00:01:36.930> from<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:38.430> gold<00:01:38.670> standard<00:01:38.970> and

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
money supply from the gold standard and

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.230 
money supply from the gold standard and
it's<00:01:39.900> basically<00:01:40.380> just<00:01:40.500> backed<00:01:41.100> on<00:01:41.460> the

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
it's basically just backed on the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.539 
it's basically just backed on the
government's<00:01:42.840> promise<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.740> has<00:01:43.979> value

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
system which makes the money as a whole

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.280 
system which makes the money as a whole
worth<00:03:22.900> less<00:03:23.290> and<00:03:23.590> that<00:03:25.050> sucks<00:03:26.050> too<00:03:26.260> because

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
worth less and that sucks too because

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.530 
worth less and that sucks too because
you<00:03:26.650> used<00:03:26.800> to<00:03:26.920> be<00:03:27.040> able<00:03:27.190> to<00:03:27.489> you<00:03:27.820> know<00:03:27.970> you<00:03:28.390> have

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.570 
gold and it had a certain value and that
value<00:03:31.090> would<00:03:31.660> hold<00:03:31.989> true<00:03:32.080> over<00:03:32.920> a<00:03:33.160> long<00:03:33.550> period

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
value would hold true over a long period

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.050 
value would hold true over a long period
of<00:03:34.120> time<00:03:34.180> but<00:03:34.660> now<00:03:34.840> our<00:03:35.250> money<00:03:36.250> becomes<00:03:36.700> worth
