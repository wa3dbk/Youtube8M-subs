00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.699
 m 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.960
 Yes 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.960
 Oh 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.970
 yeah 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:49.490
 we knew we had to win tonight 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.860
 it's still easy to do 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.550
 I took the game by the good end 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.320
 and then he makes game they have they have 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.750
 a little leaden because you were not 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.240
 in a 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.909
 a great ace 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.490
 sometimes he gets hurt at second goal a 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.510
 gag during jÃ©rÃ©my who also like 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.680
 just before half time so 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.539
 I made two changes before mid 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.579
 time is telling you a little 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.959
 for hepatitis early second 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:16.140
 halftime is a game that makes sense 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.609
 where France o absolute to counter on a 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.319
 anodyne strike here is the strike is 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:20.939
 landed and scooped into a pole and 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.079
 that was a lot of things against 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:24.269
 we and it's true that at that moment 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:27.150
 I was a little worried I think we have 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.470
 well knew how to react we scored the third 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.220
 goal elsewhere and in the next minute 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.230
 of course resumes 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.700
 second goal so when I see it was 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.320
 it was complicated this beginning zenith in 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.240
 being very complicated by cons what 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.620
 I liked it after a while we got 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.600
 struggled to stay in the game 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.400
 why that niortais and 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.640
 situations and shock we finished well the 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.050
 match 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.750
 here we have had opportunities on the 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.850
 end what it was logical for it 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.330
 there are french we should even 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.110
 rather did some interesting things 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.510
 especially sought to preserve our 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.040
 advantage but here's that with a 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.170
 victory we were in league 1 so no 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.990
 reason no more than 200 sailboats in the air 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.760
 very happy I am very proud of the 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.260
 proud of my players very happy for 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.510
 my leaders to support them well 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.210
 sold because that was it atmosphere 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.400
 we would like a drink often 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.940
 with wonderful things to live 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.720
 to the cynical private affair 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.690
 that's a lot of things at the same 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.420
 time I do not feel like I have 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.260
 filled filled but my duties here 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.940
 just today 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.840
 but I'm happy for them all 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.110
 people who live with daily life 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:36.370
 because it's people driving well 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:38.590
 at the microphone but we heard about the myth of 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.240
 bronze this time you do not know of this 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:51.030
 month and its price but yes can 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:54.520
 hold but not die I'm told that 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.530
 a quarter of the municipal budget 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:00.870
 it's something great 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.870
 evening sky with thick hair 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:13.770
 you can live live on your small 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:16.850
 girl and wishes exactly 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:19.049
 we were not wrong reacted on 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.400
 a very good time 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.220
 you believe vivos a player that I like 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.750
 well maybe not this one receives 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:30.840
 animates 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:33.030
 of elaborated niort who did not let go 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.509
 it's a big big match exactly 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.509
 we do it 

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:38.509
 Paris 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:47.979
 this ep 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:50.089
 we will serve and our chance 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:52.279
 the pressure it was a good pressure 

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:53.360
 tonight and that you had who knows wazza 

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:54.880

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.980
 I hope that 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:01.750
 the next game con sen and 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.950
 past we can she knows after 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.500
 it's a common place now 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:09.660
 now that's the party that's where I 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.660
 go then I invented 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.440
 at
