00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.570 
Peter 35 @ w @ laptop review and this
review<00:00:11.540> is<00:00:11.570> going<00:00:11.780> to<00:00:12.020> look<00:00:12.200> at<00:00:12.410> a<00:00:12.440> design<00:00:13.190> and

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:13.580 
review is going to look at a design and

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.710 
review is going to look at a design and
a<00:00:13.789> style<00:00:14.270> issue<00:00:15.670> so<00:00:16.670> the<00:00:16.850> first<00:00:17.090> design

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
a style issue so the first design

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.450 
a style issue so the first design
aspects<00:00:18.350> we<00:00:18.440> are<00:00:18.530> going<00:00:18.710> to<00:00:18.830> look<00:00:18.980> at<00:00:19.160> are

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
aspects we are going to look at are

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.640 
aspects we are going to look at are
these<00:00:19.760> two<00:00:20.150> USB<00:00:20.900> ports<00:00:20.930> here<00:00:21.590> and<00:00:22.960> if<00:00:23.960> you<00:00:24.020> can

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
these two USB ports here and if you can

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.840 
these two USB ports here and if you can
see<00:00:25.100> in<00:00:25.460> the<00:00:26.390> USB<00:00:26.870> port<00:00:27.410> you<00:00:28.280> can<00:00:28.460> see<00:00:28.580> that<00:00:28.610> the

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:28.850 
see in the USB port you can see that the

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.889 
see in the USB port you can see that the
middle<00:00:29.600> connecting<00:00:30.170> slot<00:00:30.470> is<00:00:30.850> flush<00:00:31.850> with<00:00:31.899> the

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:32.899 
middle connecting slot is flush with the

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.139 
middle connecting slot is flush with the
actual<00:00:33.469> part<00:00:33.950> itself<00:00:34.399> on<00:00:34.670> the<00:00:34.760> side<00:00:34.940> of<00:00:34.969> the

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:35.149 
actual part itself on the side of the

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.160 
actual part itself on the side of the
laptop<00:00:35.570> and<00:00:36.760> just<00:00:37.760> as<00:00:37.879> a<00:00:37.909> comparison<00:00:38.120> on<00:00:38.839> my

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
laptop and just as a comparison on my

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.709 
laptop and just as a comparison on my
old<00:00:39.440> laptop<00:00:39.559> this<00:00:40.129> is<00:00:40.249> a<00:00:40.280> USB<00:00:40.699> pot<00:00:40.969> and<00:00:41.149> you<00:00:41.570> can

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:41.719 
old laptop this is a USB pot and you can

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:45.009 
old laptop this is a USB pot and you can
barely<00:00:42.050> see<00:00:42.499> the<00:00:42.859> middle<00:00:43.219> slot<00:00:43.640> connector<00:00:44.239> for

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:45.019 
barely see the middle slot connector for

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:47.229 
barely see the middle slot connector for
the<00:00:45.050> USB<00:00:45.800> port<00:00:46.129> I<00:00:46.399> would<00:00:46.550> have<00:00:46.670> to<00:00:46.789> tilt<00:00:47.089> my

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
the USB port I would have to tilt my

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:54.099 
the USB port I would have to tilt my
camera<00:00:50.620> like<00:00:51.620> that<00:00:52.609> and<00:00:52.940> then<00:00:53.659> you<00:00:53.780> can<00:00:53.899> see

00:00:54.099 --> 00:00:54.109 
camera like that and then you can see

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:59.379 
camera like that and then you can see
the<00:00:55.389> middle<00:00:56.389> slot<00:00:56.690> for<00:00:56.989> the<00:00:57.019> USB<00:00:57.589> port<00:00:57.920> so<00:00:58.389> in

00:00:59.379 --> 00:00:59.389 
the middle slot for the USB port so in

00:00:59.389 --> 00:01:00.969 
the middle slot for the USB port so in
practical<00:00:59.749> terms<00:00:59.899> what<00:01:00.289> does<00:01:00.679> that<00:01:00.769> actually

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:00.979 
practical terms what does that actually

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:09.510 
practical terms what does that actually
mean<00:01:01.249> well<00:01:01.789> let's<00:01:02.089> plug<00:01:02.420> it<00:01:02.569> in<00:01:02.690> a<00:01:02.929> USB<00:01:03.589> cable

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.260 

this<00:01:10.520> is<00:01:10.760> the<00:01:10.970> results<00:01:11.500> about<00:01:12.500> a<00:01:12.530> one

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
this is the results about a one

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.110 
this is the results about a one
centimeter<00:01:14.470> gap<00:01:15.470> between<00:01:15.950> the<00:01:16.280> ports<00:01:16.580> and<00:01:16.880> the

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
centimeter gap between the ports and the

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.660 
centimeter gap between the ports and the
actual<00:01:17.480> protecting<00:01:18.350> plaques<00:01:18.860> a<00:01:19.070> plastic<00:01:19.490> bit

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
actual protecting plaques a plastic bit

actual protecting plaques a plastic bit
of<00:01:19.880> a<00:01:20.240> USB<00:01:20.780> cable<00:01:21.110> if<00:01:22.100> I<00:01:22.250> just<00:01:22.460> zoom<00:01:22.760> in<00:01:22.910> here<00:01:24.220> we

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
of a USB cable if I just zoom in here we

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.260 
of a USB cable if I just zoom in here we
have<00:01:25.400> all<00:01:25.670> this<00:01:26.060> extra<00:01:26.410> USB<00:01:27.580> cable<00:01:28.580> protruding

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
have all this extra USB cable protruding

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.540 
have all this extra USB cable protruding
now<00:01:30.020> it's<00:01:30.200> still<00:01:30.410> firmly<00:01:30.770> plugged<00:01:31.280> into<00:01:31.430> the

now it's still firmly plugged into the

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.910 
now it's still firmly plugged into the
pot<00:01:31.910> is<00:01:32.330> nothing<00:01:33.050> wrong<00:01:33.410> about<00:01:33.560> it<00:01:33.710> actually

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
pot is nothing wrong about it actually

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.760 
pot is nothing wrong about it actually
coming<00:01:34.400> out<00:01:34.640> but<00:01:35.420> it<00:01:35.540> just<00:01:35.690> sticks<00:01:36.050> out<00:01:36.320> and

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
coming out but it just sticks out and

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.130 
coming out but it just sticks out and
again<00:01:37.700> to<00:01:37.880> use<00:01:38.090> veet<00:01:38.300> other<00:01:38.540> laptop<00:01:38.930> as<00:01:39.110> a

again to use veet other laptop as a

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.510 
again to use veet other laptop as a
comparison<00:01:39.850> as<00:01:41.410> you<00:01:42.410> can<00:01:42.590> see<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:42.980> USB<00:01:43.490> cable

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
comparison as you can see the USB cable

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.840 
comparison as you can see the USB cable
slots<00:01:44.150> in<00:01:44.360> much<00:01:45.020> further<00:01:45.320> and<00:01:45.770> takes<00:01:46.310> out<00:01:46.580> a

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
slots in much further and takes out a

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.180 
slots in much further and takes out a
good<00:01:47.540> half<00:01:48.020> a<00:01:48.200> centimeter<00:01:48.710> to<00:01:48.920> it

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
good half a centimeter to it

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.400 
good half a centimeter to it
three-quarters<00:01:50.150> of<00:01:50.180> a<00:01:50.330> centimeter<00:01:50.810> so

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
three-quarters of a centimeter so

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.880 
three-quarters of a centimeter so
there's<00:01:51.680> a<00:01:51.740> lot<00:01:51.950> less<00:01:52.400> of<00:01:52.900> the<00:01:53.900> metal

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
there's a lot less of the metal

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.240 
there's a lot less of the metal
connector<00:01:55.340> exposed<00:01:56.740> whether<00:01:57.740> this<00:01:58.070> was

connector exposed whether this was

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.580 
connector exposed whether this was
intentional<00:01:58.640> or<00:01:59.060> a<00:01:59.180> design<00:01:59.840> compromise<00:02:00.560> that

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
intentional or a design compromise that

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.770 
intentional or a design compromise that
gigabyte<00:02:01.250> had<00:02:01.490> to<00:02:01.670> make<00:02:01.880> when<00:02:02.240> making<00:02:02.420> such<00:02:02.570> a

gigabyte had to make when making such a
slimline<00:02:03.460> compact<00:02:04.460> laptop<00:02:04.909> is<00:02:05.390> a<00:02:05.420> question

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
slimline compact laptop is a question

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.800 
slimline compact laptop is a question
only<00:02:06.140> vacant<00:02:06.500> answer<00:02:07.130> it<00:02:08.000> does<00:02:08.360> it<00:02:08.539> feel<00:02:08.780> like

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
only vacant answer it does it feel like

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.080 
only vacant answer it does it feel like
you're<00:02:09.200> adding<00:02:09.560> at<00:02:09.679> bigger<00:02:09.950> wings<00:02:10.310> onto<00:02:10.759> the

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
you're adding at bigger wings onto the

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.200 
you're adding at bigger wings onto the
laptop<00:02:11.239> and<00:02:11.569> it<00:02:11.629> does<00:02:11.840> make<00:02:12.200> it<00:02:12.410> a<00:02:12.560> little<00:02:12.590> less

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
laptop and it does make it a little less

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.540 
laptop and it does make it a little less
agile<00:02:14.210> and<00:02:14.510> possible<00:02:15.260> and<00:02:15.380> stable<00:02:15.950> when<00:02:16.460> you

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
agile and possible and stable when you

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.200 
agile and possible and stable when you
have<00:02:16.730> things

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
have things

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.170 
have things
then<00:02:17.450> so<00:02:17.840> it's<00:02:17.960> just<00:02:18.110> something<00:02:18.470> to<00:02:18.830> consider

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
then so it's just something to consider

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.770 
then so it's just something to consider
now<00:02:20.180> on<00:02:20.540> to<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:21.370> style<00:02:22.370> issue<00:02:22.640> I've<00:02:23.390> now<00:02:23.660> had

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
now on to the style issue I've now had

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.490 
now on to the style issue I've now had
the<00:02:23.930> laptop<00:02:24.110> for<00:02:24.590> about<00:02:25.430> 48<00:02:26.030> hours<00:02:26.420> and<00:02:26.630> this

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
the laptop for about 48 hours and this

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.550 
the laptop for about 48 hours and this
is<00:02:27.800> the<00:02:28.190> state<00:02:28.520> of<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:29.540> lid<00:02:30.050> of<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:30.680> laptop

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
is the state of the lid of the laptop

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.830 
is the state of the lid of the laptop
all<00:02:33.560> these<00:02:33.860> watches<00:02:34.310> here<00:02:34.580> are<00:02:35.060> all<00:02:35.300> finger
