fortunately cept Ron's idea of acaso is

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:26.790 
fortunately cept Ron's idea of acaso is
a<00:00:24.820> little<00:00:25.090> bit<00:00:25.210> different<00:00:25.630> it's<00:00:26.199> all<00:00:26.410> sort<00:00:26.740> of

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800

by People Mover standards it's
relatively<00:00:51.879> compact<00:00:52.360> but<00:00:53.050> at<00:00:53.140> the<00:00:53.199> same<00:00:53.350> time

of<00:01:22.119> the<00:01:22.179> equation<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:25.659> that's<00:01:25.810> a<00:01:25.899> pretty

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
of the equation and that's a pretty

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.749 
of the equation and that's a pretty
important<00:01:26.590> part<00:01:26.740> of<00:01:26.890> the<00:01:26.950> Picasso<00:01:27.460> sales

now<00:01:31.420> to<00:01:31.479> put<00:01:31.810> that<00:01:31.840> in<00:01:31.990> perspective<00:01:32.140> that's

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
now to put that in perspective that's

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.490 
now to put that in perspective that's
roughly<00:01:33.130> the<00:01:33.220> same<00:01:33.490> price<00:01:33.729> as<00:01:34.090> a<00:01:34.149> raft<00:01:34.990> of<00:01:35.259> four

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
roughly the same price as a raft of four

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.290 
roughly the same price as a raft of four
wheel<00:01:35.649> drives<00:01:35.920> which<00:01:36.190> Aziz<00:01:36.610> love<00:01:37.000> and<00:01:37.240> they

wheel drives which Aziz love and they

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.870 
wheel drives which Aziz love and they
also<00:01:37.509> play<00:01:37.899> the<00:01:38.170> family<00:01:38.530> car<00:01:38.740> role<00:01:38.979> perfectly

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
also play the family car role perfectly

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.669 
also play the family car role perfectly
but<00:01:40.509> where<00:01:40.690> this<00:01:40.780> one's<00:01:41.050> different<00:01:41.200> is<00:01:41.530> it

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:41.679 
but where this one's different is it

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:43.680 
but where this one's different is it
doesn't<00:01:41.860> have<00:01:42.159> all<00:01:42.369> that<00:01:42.429> heavy<00:01:42.970> for<00:01:43.330> drive

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
doesn't have all that heavy for drive

doesn't have all that heavy for drive
running<00:01:44.020> gear<00:01:44.170> the<00:01:44.319> sort<00:01:44.500> of<00:01:44.560> stuff<00:01:44.740> that<00:01:44.800> most

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
running gear the sort of stuff that most

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.410 
running gear the sort of stuff that most
people<00:01:45.550> are<00:01:45.700> never<00:01:46.060> going<00:01:46.300> to<00:01:46.360> use<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.880> instead

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
people are never going to use so instead

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.809 
people are never going to use so instead
you<00:01:49.660> get<00:01:49.810> a<00:01:49.840> bit<00:01:50.050> more<00:01:50.200> space<00:01:50.530> and<00:01:51.160> also<00:01:51.580> an

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:51.819 
you get a bit more space and also an

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:53.969 
you get a bit more space and also an
economical<00:01:52.420> four-cylinder<00:01:53.229> diesel<00:01:53.440> engine

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
economical four-cylinder diesel engine

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.630 
economical four-cylinder diesel engine
which<00:01:54.130> really<00:01:54.520> does<00:01:54.759> sip<00:01:55.090> like<00:01:55.450> a<00:01:55.509> small<00:01:55.929> car

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
which really does sip like a small car

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.400 
which really does sip like a small car
it<00:01:57.640> just<00:01:57.700> doesn't<00:01:58.270> look<00:01:58.300> as<00:01:58.660> masculine<00:01:59.379> a

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
it just doesn't look as masculine a

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.490 
it just doesn't look as masculine a
macho<00:02:00.099> as<00:02:00.280> a<00:02:00.310> big<00:02:00.610> four-wheel<00:02:01.090> drive<00:02:01.360> but<00:02:01.660> hey

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
macho as a big four-wheel drive but hey

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.339 
macho as a big four-wheel drive but hey
at<00:02:02.770> least<00:02:02.830> it's<00:02:03.399> different<00:02:03.759> and<00:02:04.170> DIF<00:02:05.170> what

00:02:05.339 --> 00:02:05.349 
at least it's different and DIF what

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:07.740 
at least it's different and DIF what
it's<00:02:05.470> like<00:02:05.619> to<00:02:05.800> drive<00:02:05.920> to<00:02:06.369> the<00:02:07.119> four-cylinder

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
it's like to drive to the four-cylinder

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.180 
it's like to drive to the four-cylinder
diesel<00:02:07.899> takes<00:02:08.319> a<00:02:08.440> bit<00:02:08.590> of<00:02:08.619> getting<00:02:08.739> used<00:02:08.950> to

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
diesel takes a bit of getting used to

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.220 
diesel takes a bit of getting used to
but<00:02:09.489> once<00:02:09.819> you<00:02:10.149> get<00:02:10.330> there<00:02:10.569> it<00:02:10.720> actually<00:02:10.989> works

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
but once you get there it actually works

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.140 
but once you get there it actually works
pretty<00:02:11.470> well<00:02:11.590> gets<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.069> car<00:02:12.250> along<00:02:12.489> smile<00:02:12.849> and

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
pretty well gets the car along smile and

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.760 
pretty well gets the car along smile and
works<00:02:13.300> well<00:02:13.540> with<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:13.870> six-speed<00:02:14.290> Automatic

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
works well with the six-speed Automatic

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.130 
works well with the six-speed Automatic
the<00:02:15.459> steering<00:02:15.849> so<00:02:16.060> so<00:02:16.360> and<00:02:16.540> it<00:02:16.629> does<00:02:16.810> lean<00:02:17.110> a

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
the steering so so and it does lean a

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.570 
the steering so so and it does lean a
bit<00:02:17.349> through<00:02:17.530> corners<00:02:17.950> but<00:02:18.099> I<00:02:18.190> can<00:02:18.340> live<00:02:18.520> with

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
bit through corners but I can live with

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.850 
bit through corners but I can live with
that<00:02:18.819> but<00:02:19.450> it's<00:02:19.629> bumps<00:02:20.110> that<00:02:20.290> really<00:02:20.680> are<00:02:20.830> not

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
that but it's bumps that really are not

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.460 
that but it's bumps that really are not
