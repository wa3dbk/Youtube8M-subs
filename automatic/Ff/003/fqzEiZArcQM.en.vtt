00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
Wi-Fi and this is a memory card slot at

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.850 
Wi-Fi and this is a memory card slot at
the<00:02:27.010> right<00:02:27.160> side<00:02:27.430> we<00:02:27.670> can<00:02:27.700> see<00:02:28.030> here<00:02:28.360> 2<00:02:29.110> USB<00:02:29.650> 3

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
the right side we can see here 2 USB 3

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.140 
the right side we can see here 2 USB 3
ports<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.620> USB<00:02:32.620> 3<00:02:32.890> means<00:02:33.340> that<00:02:33.730> it<00:02:33.940> can

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
ports and the USB 3 means that it can

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.750 
ports and the USB 3 means that it can
transfer<00:02:34.600> that<00:02:34.840> 10<00:02:35.530> times<00:02:35.830> then<00:02:36.160> normal<00:02:36.519> USB

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
transfer that 10 times then normal USB

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.630 
transfer that 10 times then normal USB
and<00:02:37.269> here<00:02:38.080> is<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:38.650> DVD<00:02:39.190> and<00:02:40.140> I<00:02:41.160> think<00:02:42.160> this<00:02:42.550> is

and here is the DVD and I think this is

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.130 
and here is the DVD and I think this is
the<00:02:42.730> power<00:02:43.090> slot<00:02:43.690> on<00:02:44.019> the<00:02:44.080> left<00:02:44.800> side<00:02:46.110> we<00:02:47.110> can
