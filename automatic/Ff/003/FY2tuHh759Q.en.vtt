00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.769
 that more kids in Mexico I am and beni 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.629
 violence in this call of duty guide 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:18.110
 goes on how to get a care so that 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:20.390
 the map get totally free and the 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.880
 we practically do not have to do anything 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.460
 more than being the first to get 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.770
 that care package to be able to do 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.090
 get this care pack is totally 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.699
 free chaos what we have to do 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.739
 is to go to the center of the map where 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.989
 there is a truck in the middle of the 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.150
 street in this truck if you are 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.040
 they approach and they want to check us 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.430
 exit in the option of coss in an option 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.260
 to make a book if you do not do this to 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.930
 moment of making the book is going to 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.670
 exploit the one of the doors so 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.159
 say it and they will find a care 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.479
 package inside guys something very 

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:55.489
 important that they have to know about 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:57.440
 this trick only works once 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.000
 per round this means that if it is a 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.430
 game per rounds can do several 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.140
 times on the same map but if it's 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.820
 example a team deathmatch is the first 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.860
 to grab him so what does he have to 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.780
 do is fast and if you think that 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.790
 they have to approach this is incorrect 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.010
 You can also get this care 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.990
 package throwing a grenade so if 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.970
 you have a grenade a centex or what 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.920
 that they exploit can throw it to the 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.780
 start of the game and run 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.850
 practically to be able to get this 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.960
 car pack is something important kids is 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.310
 that is here so that it is always 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.530
 different will always give us things 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.870
 good bad things depends on the 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.000
 lucky we have here already knows it zone 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.040
 in the game of truth 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.170
 in fact it was very interesting that nobody 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.030
 in the round or in the game know what 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.380
 I did all the rounds I did it and nobody 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.450
 He learned how he was doing but 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.680
 well the final they told me it was a 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.270
 hacker that because it was pulled out that the 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.370
 park I know where I got it from 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.930
 well it's something that I think not many 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.729
 you know and that's why I like to share it with 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.380
