00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.050
 hello to all the guys welcome in 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.850
 this new video we went out today 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.120
 we are traveling to contain a channel 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.380
 and we came to a protected park 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:41.450
 looking among the stones we found a 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.450
 beautiful specimen of female lead snake 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.970
 mine is not a channel it deals with 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.890
 mainly harping so go in 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.170
 look around for amphibious reptiles though 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.900
 today since I do too 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.250
 these things I go around looking for them 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.120
 classify them and see their status of 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.230
 health 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.969
 today we came across this 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.890
 beautiful snake and I take the opportunity 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.989
 to give a warning to all those 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.070
 spectators who must respect them 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.710
 these animals must not be killed 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.619
 unjustifiably I understand people 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.539
 that maybe they run in their garden 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.360
 a wooden board and below find us a 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:17.880
 big snake is actually doing more 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.600
 fear them of us rather than us of 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.770
 their 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.390
 they can't do absolutely 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.310
 have nothing in this case you have seen 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.140
 who tried to take a bite but the 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.119
 maximum they can do they do not do 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.039
 bad for man and basically not there 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.960
 they are not even close to tend to stay 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:34.430
 however in the wild nature type 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.430
 this one we have here on the side 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:46.310
 and therefore do not bother anyone 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.410
 live please don't kill the snakes 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.990
 no logical reason why really 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.790
 they are protected animals throughout Italy and 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:57.140
 so you also do damage not only to the 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:02:00.140
 nature but also legislative now we do 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.460
 the release clip is ready 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.840
 for the liberation of this beautiful woman 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.840
 female about a meter long 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.970
 I take this opportunity to tell you to follow 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.040
 the reptile mission channel it deals with 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.080
 only this kind of video or 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.360
 goes around looking for animals says 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.370
 something about what it finds and invites everyone 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.239
 to respect nature and animals that 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.239
 the nos come
