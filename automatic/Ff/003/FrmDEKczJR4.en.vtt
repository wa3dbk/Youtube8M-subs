00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.780
 jo people this johan welcome to blackface zombies first impression got there 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:12.200
 what strikes me the first set on pc I play ap 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.580
 also there is a special once the scarf game yes it is just the slatink 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.970
 added and that means that with his beer shot the campsite and that the club 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.500
 that schools grind we start again with much more yes just look because I have to 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.390
 let's see if it's my settings 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.079
 yes exactly how corrupt would commit further was harry 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.250
 market arsenal paria 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.440
 ok then people go so it turned out Monday to which March we go 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.540
 to do 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.740
 9 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.490
 2 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.560
 but it seems to be nice tea 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.560
 this it is for him in any case 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.140
 for breivik redemption 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.780
 talent and this was bass close this was very boring because you can be your child like that 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.320
 to buy 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.320
 so the phone 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.300
 ap this could be a little brussel 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.110
 a brief look at the room when wim clean up or the servoy flanks full 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.450
 can start there 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.450
 don't turn your bare ass 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.220
 and then I am going to play nicely in the series 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.150
 luckily you pay attention to the background he was crazy he she wants the subscription place 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.360
 media that is possible 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.360
 see all the legs 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.900
 huntelaar seems a bit but that she works 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.900
 I myself finally not at all 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.799
 and I am simply looking forward to the zombies' zen action 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.480
 Well for years the damage at the water tower could be all in all so it is demolition 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.560
 but that doesn't matter 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.820
 also in that of not that there 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.820
 has an impact on my 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.180
 3 because my busy leg, so to speak 

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:14.339
 but yes I will wait a while I have the time 

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:19.790
 and otherwise I'll be a little later a modest hit that can skippy here 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:23.649
 that bit when I was watching my game 

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:25.629
 I thought so 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:30.030
 I am inclined to start the world leader with wish then you are they are blue too 

00:02:30.029 --> 00:02:33.029
 play and it ruled itself and I immediately 

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:38.859
 they have everything nice and wide, let's see where we all count in this 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:43.009
 notice it still looks like the raid is in extra time because I am looking up because 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.069
 I think I know you 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.379
 now this is how the escalator looks like here are coming as zombies 

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:54.729
 but I thought there were some ice cream here 

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:59.979
 look around the karin so that you can see that bit 

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:04.009
 the setting stand seem to be heights 

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:11.249
 and more in its old days where all the factories l sometimes agree with it all 

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:12.439
 miquel 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:15.439
 I have two frames and I get used to it too 

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:18.809
 and i thought your centex there too 

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:20.619
 what the verdict 

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:22.079
 team leader 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.639
 the main reason 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:29.090
 and what is this martijn the south it is a bit weird from I think I am one 

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:30.399
 kind of exciting 

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:33.559
 I have to say because recognition is really special 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:37.109
 we are so good at it 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:40.059
 but a real special 

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:45.219
 yes, those drawings add up to how they are young boy drawings 

00:03:45.779 --> 00:03:48.779
 that was another raid, according to a well 

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:52.399
 Well 

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:56.199
 and yes I hope not if you have liked that was just a bk 

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:57.940
 just nice just yet 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.509
 but I understand those responses ap 

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:03.509
 the can again have larger buffers in the aex 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.219
 controls 

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:10.230
 the language of jans 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.599
 come with Sint Maarten 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:16.059
 and then nothing 

00:04:16.059 --> 00:04:18.909
 trop little girl has 

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:21.909
 percent in the min 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:27.009
 okay the speed further than I want to live here thank you for looking 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:29.189
