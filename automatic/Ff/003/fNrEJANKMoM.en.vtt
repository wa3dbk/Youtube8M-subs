no matter what sort of camera are using

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.749 
no matter what sort of camera are using
you're<00:00:13.500> going<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:13.920> encounter<00:00:14.250> certain

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
you're going to encounter certain

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.450 
you're going to encounter certain
problems<00:00:15.420> with<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.199> lens<00:00:16.440> because<00:00:17.070> of<00:00:17.340> the

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
problems with the lens because of the

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.340 
problems with the lens because of the
way<00:00:17.550> that<00:00:17.730> lenses<00:00:18.090> are<00:00:18.240> made<00:00:18.270> you're<00:00:19.260> gonna

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
way that lenses are made you're gonna

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.769 
way that lenses are made you're gonna
have<00:00:19.590> problems<00:00:20.070> with<00:00:20.340> distortion<00:00:21.119> which<00:00:21.600> is

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
have problems with distortion which is

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.929 
have problems with distortion which is
the<00:00:21.930> bending<00:00:22.260> of<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.560> image<00:00:22.830> vignette<00:00:23.789> egg

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
the bending of the image vignette egg

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.849 
the bending of the image vignette egg
which<00:00:24.150> is<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.420> darkening<00:00:24.810> of<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.019> corners<00:00:25.410> or

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
which is the darkening of the corners or

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.460 
which is the darkening of the corners or
chromatic<00:00:26.609> aberration<00:00:27.240> which<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.170> color

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
chromatic aberration which is the color

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.040 
chromatic aberration which is the color
fringing<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.189> this<00:00:29.910> is<00:00:30.060> most<00:00:30.330> prevalent<00:00:30.689> in

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
fringing and this is most prevalent in

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.680 
fringing and this is most prevalent in
low-end<00:00:31.679> mobile<00:00:31.980> devices<00:00:32.460> or<00:00:33.000> something<00:00:33.570> like

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
low-end mobile devices or something like

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.260 
low-end mobile devices or something like
the<00:00:33.809> GoPro<00:00:34.230> but<00:00:34.950> you'll<00:00:35.309> also<00:00:35.489> notice<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.090> on<00:00:36.210> a

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
the GoPro but you'll also notice it on a

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.690 
the GoPro but you'll also notice it on a
high-end<00:00:36.660> DSLR<00:00:37.469> with<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.800> zeiss<00:00:38.129> lens<00:00:38.430> even

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
high-end DSLR with a zeiss lens even

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.920 
high-end DSLR with a zeiss lens even
though<00:00:38.850> it's<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.030> really<00:00:39.210> expensive<00:00:39.420> fancy

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
though it's a really expensive fancy

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.110 
though it's a really expensive fancy
prime<00:00:40.410> lens<00:00:40.649> there's<00:00:41.280> still<00:00:41.610> problems<00:00:42.030> with

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
prime lens there's still problems with

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.299 
prime lens there's still problems with
it<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:43.170> we<00:00:43.379> can<00:00:43.500> account<00:00:43.710> for<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.070> in

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
it and we can account for that in

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.430 
it and we can account for that in
software<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.629> want<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.809> show<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.020> some<00:00:46.200> tips

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
software so I want to show you some tips

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.869 
software so I want to show you some tips
and<00:00:46.680> tricks<00:00:46.920> for<00:00:47.370> how<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.550> get<00:00:47.730> those

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
and tricks for how to get those

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.420 
and tricks for how to get those
artifacts<00:00:48.539> caused<00:00:48.899> by<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.140> lens<00:00:49.469> out<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.309> your

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
artifacts caused by the lens out of your

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.180 
artifacts caused by the lens out of your
image<00:00:51.289> okay<00:00:52.289> so<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.590> first<00:00:52.800> image<00:00:53.039> we're

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
image okay so the first image we're

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.110 
image okay so the first image we're
gonna<00:00:53.309> look<00:00:53.460> at<00:00:53.670> is<00:00:54.500> a<00:00:55.500> dmg<00:00:56.039> file<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.489> raw<00:00:56.789> file

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
gonna look at is a dmg file a raw file

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.060 
gonna look at is a dmg file a raw file
so<00:00:57.600> naturally<00:00:58.170> that's<00:00:58.320> going<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.590> open<00:00:58.620> in

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
so naturally that's going to open in

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.090 
so naturally that's going to open in
Camera<00:00:59.399> Raw<00:00:59.579> and<00:01:00.109> all<00:01:01.109> we<00:01:01.350> need<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.559> do<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.890> come

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
Camera Raw and all we need to do is come

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.219 
Camera Raw and all we need to do is come
in<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.280> lens<00:01:02.489> correction<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.270> we'll<00:01:03.930> see<00:01:04.080> that

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
in to lens correction and we'll see that

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.920 
in to lens correction and we'll see that
there's<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.439> little<00:01:04.559> toggle<00:01:04.830> here<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.930> not

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
there's a little toggle here and not

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.570 
there's a little toggle here and not
only<00:01:07.049> will<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.350> remove<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:08.130> lot<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.490> the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
only will that remove a lot of the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.340 
only will that remove a lot of the
distortion<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.750> fallout<00:01:09.990> in<00:01:10.260> the

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
distortion and the fallout in the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.350 
distortion and the fallout in the
corners<00:01:10.710> but<00:01:11.280> it'll<00:01:11.460> also<00:01:11.549> show<00:01:11.760> us<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.270> this

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
corners but it'll also show us that this

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.080 
corners but it'll also show us that this
was<00:01:12.540> taken<00:01:12.869> with<00:01:13.020> my<00:01:13.170> canon<00:01:13.619> with<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.159> 17<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.820> 40

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
was taken with my canon with a 17 to 40

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.810 
was taken with my canon with a 17 to 40
lens<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.570> those<00:01:15.960> wide-angle<00:01:16.590> lenses<00:01:16.950> really

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
lens and those wide-angle lenses really

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.550 
lens and those wide-angle lenses really
have<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.030> lot<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.270> distortion<00:01:18.900> so<00:01:19.170> pretty

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
have a lot of distortion so pretty

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.499 
have a lot of distortion so pretty
profound<00:01:19.920> difference<00:01:20.400> there<00:01:20.640> if<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.299> want<00:01:21.450> to

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
profound difference there if I want to

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.270 
profound difference there if I want to
go<00:01:21.570> into<00:01:21.659> Camera<00:01:21.990> Raw<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.799> don't<00:01:23.100> have<00:01:23.250> a

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
go into Camera Raw and I don't have a

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.249 
go into Camera Raw and I don't have a
raw<00:01:23.430> file<00:01:23.700> remember<00:01:24.299> all<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.630> need<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.869> do<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.110> go

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
raw file remember all I need to do is go

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.679 
raw file remember all I need to do is go
over<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.409> photoshop<00:01:25.970> preferences<00:01:26.970> file

it to open those non RAW files now using
CC<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.000> later<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.570> can<00:01:37.049> just<00:01:37.229> come<00:01:37.560> into<00:01:37.740> Camera

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
CC and later I can just come into Camera

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.700 
CC and later I can just come into Camera
Raw<00:01:38.400> as<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.759> filter<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.450> with<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:40.170> image<00:01:40.350> I

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
Raw as a filter and with this image I

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.039 
Raw as a filter and with this image I
can<00:01:41.280> pop<00:01:41.460> in<00:01:41.670> there<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.299> there's<00:01:42.840> another

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
can pop in there and there's another

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.510 
can pop in there and there's another
thing<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.380> want<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.619> do<00:01:43.770> which<00:01:44.220> is<00:01:44.250> in<00:01:44.460> the

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
thing I want to do which is in the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.020 
thing I want to do which is in the
manual<00:01:44.729> section<00:01:45.180> I'm<00:01:45.810> going<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.079> hit<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.350> and

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
manual section I'm going to hit a and

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.399 
manual section I'm going to hit a and
that's<00:01:48.030> going<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.360> apply<00:01:48.540> up<00:01:48.810> right<00:01:49.049> in

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
that's going to apply up right in

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.410 
that's going to apply up right in
addition<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.979> lens<00:01:50.610> correction<00:01:51.090> it's<00:01:51.240> going

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
addition to lens correction it's going

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.819 
addition to lens correction it's going
to<00:01:51.479> stand<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.899> image<00:01:52.110> up<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.470> do<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.560> quick

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
to stand the image up and do a quick

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.590 
to stand the image up and do a quick
perspective<00:01:53.189> correction<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.329> that's<00:01:54.450> another

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
perspective correction so that's another

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.109 
perspective correction so that's another
thing<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:54.869> I<00:01:54.990> can<00:01:55.170> do<00:01:55.290> there<00:01:55.729> now<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:56.790> do<00:01:56.909> have

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
thing that I can do there now I do have

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.459 
thing that I can do there now I do have
some<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.360> this<00:01:57.450> functionality<00:01:57.810> in<00:01:58.049> Photoshop

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
some of this functionality in Photoshop

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.709 
some of this functionality in Photoshop
as<00:01:58.619> well<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:59.159> the<00:02:00.000> implementation<00:02:00.600> is

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
as well and the implementation is

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.420 
as well and the implementation is
slightly<00:02:01.020> different<00:02:01.469> so<00:02:01.950> if<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.070> come<00:02:02.219> into<00:02:02.310> the

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
slightly different so if I come into the

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.899 
slightly different so if I come into the
filter<00:02:02.759> menu<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.329> go<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.079> lens<00:02:04.290> correction

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
filter menu and go to lens correction

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.819 
filter menu and go to lens correction
I'll<00:02:05.909> see<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:06.149> really<00:02:06.540> nice<00:02:06.659> dialog<00:02:07.140> for

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
I'll see this really nice dialog for

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.760 
I'll see this really nice dialog for
solving<00:02:08.369> these<00:02:08.489> same<00:02:08.700> problems<00:02:09.209> and<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:10.410> can

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
solving these same problems and I can

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.360 
solving these same problems and I can
see<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:11.009> I've<00:02:11.099> got<00:02:11.129> my<00:02:11.370> iPhone<00:02:11.970> 5s<00:02:12.540> we<00:02:12.989> autumn

else I can choose manually my camera and
my<00:02:31.370> lens<00:02:32.090> so<00:02:32.810> just<00:02:33.170> for<00:02:33.319> the<00:02:33.470> sake<00:02:33.709> of<00:02:33.769> an

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
my lens so just for the sake of an

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.180 
my lens so just for the sake of an
example<00:02:34.150> let's<00:02:35.150> look<00:02:35.239> at<00:02:35.420> this<00:02:35.569> on<00:02:35.720> an<00:02:35.840> iPhone

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
example let's look at this on an iPhone

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.670 
example let's look at this on an iPhone
3G<00:02:37.299> it's<00:02:38.299> a<00:02:38.390> minor<00:02:38.599> difference<00:02:39.019> but<00:02:39.409> there<00:02:39.560> is

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
3G it's a minor difference but there is

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.220 
3G it's a minor difference but there is
a<00:02:39.709> difference<00:02:40.420> now<00:02:41.420> what's<00:02:41.599> great<00:02:41.720> about<00:02:41.840> this

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
a difference now what's great about this

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.589 
a difference now what's great about this
is<00:02:42.769> I<00:02:43.010> can<00:02:43.159> apply<00:02:43.370> it<00:02:43.459> to<00:02:44.000> video<00:02:44.269> as<00:02:44.450> well

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:44.599 
is I can apply it to video as well

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:47.229 
is I can apply it to video as well
whether<00:02:45.260> it's<00:02:45.500> your<00:02:45.680> high-end<00:02:45.980> DSLR<00:02:46.519> video<00:02:46.640> or

whether it's your high-end DSLR video or
for<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.480> sake<00:02:47.629> of<00:02:47.660> this<00:02:47.870> example<00:02:48.069> just<00:02:49.069> a<00:02:49.220> low

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
for the sake of this example just a low

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
res video file off of my iPhone so I can

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.830 
res video file off of my iPhone so I can
confirm<00:02:54.260> that<00:02:54.319> that's<00:02:54.590> video<00:02:54.950> and<00:02:55.609> I<00:02:56.569> want<00:02:56.780> to

I<00:03:00.890> just<00:03:01.340> come<00:03:01.519> in<00:03:01.549> here<00:03:01.940> and<00:03:02.060> I<00:03:02.540> convert<00:03:02.989> it<00:03:03.019> to

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
I just come in here and I convert it to

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.770 
I just come in here and I convert it to
a<00:03:03.290> smart<00:03:03.680> filter<00:03:03.970> making<00:03:04.970> it<00:03:05.060> a<00:03:05.120> smart<00:03:05.390> filter

to process that video and then with that
done<00:03:11.150> I'll<00:03:11.750> come<00:03:11.989> back<00:03:12.109> into<00:03:12.379> lens<00:03:12.560> correction

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
done I'll come back into lens correction

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.740 
done I'll come back into lens correction
and<00:03:13.129> you'll<00:03:13.549> notice<00:03:13.819> there's<00:03:14.269> no<00:03:14.450> information
