00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:53.130 

you

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.870 

so<00:00:53.739> when<00:00:53.890> you're<00:00:54.010> doing<00:00:54.220> a<00:00:54.309> five-minute<00:00:54.700> base

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:54.880 
so when you're doing a five-minute base

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.220 
so when you're doing a five-minute base
I<00:00:55.090> think<00:00:55.329> it's<00:00:55.450> really<00:00:55.690> important<00:00:56.050> to<00:00:56.110> focus

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
I think it's really important to focus

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.229 
I think it's really important to focus
on<00:00:56.470> having<00:00:56.620> great<00:00:57.010> skin<00:00:57.309> and<00:00:57.640> then<00:00:57.820> find<00:00:58.180> your

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
on having great skin and then find your

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.450 
on having great skin and then find your
brows<00:00:58.510> because<00:00:59.200> if<00:00:59.470> you<00:00:59.559> have<00:00:59.739> time<00:00:59.980> if<00:01:00.399> you

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
brows because if you have time if you

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.560 
brows because if you have time if you
don't<00:01:00.489> have<00:01:00.700> very<00:01:00.790> much<00:01:00.970> time<00:01:01.180> that's<00:01:01.390> really

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
don't have very much time that's really

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.640 
don't have very much time that's really
what<00:01:01.690> you<00:01:01.720> want<00:01:01.960> to<00:01:02.020> do<00:01:02.079> is<00:01:02.170> just<00:01:02.199> have<00:01:02.440> a<00:01:02.470> great
