00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.299
 hi how about in this new video I wanted 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:19.180
 show them how to dictate to your mac for 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.529
 I wrote for you is very practical 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:25.180
 when making summaries of the 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:28.590
 school is kidding this but if it works 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:31.900
 very good at the time of for example search 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.520
 something in google is written by 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.550
 you the first thing we have to do 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:39.070
 is to go to system preferences and we 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.380
 we go to this section of the system that 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.690
 says dictation and speaks 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.360
 ok here we have to activate it in case 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.090
 it's deactivated, we're going to give it 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.480
 activated 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.010
 the quick function means that 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.020
 when you suppress twice by 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.150
 example that have activated this is going to 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.989
 activate dictation anywhere in 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:03.680
 the maca I have this can put the 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.680
 that you want 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:11.250
 this is the most recommended and 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.380
 language whether they are Spain from USA and 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.500
 I have to recognize the accent 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.470
 Mexican 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:22.450
 and for example we go here in an area 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.450
 of text and we write 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.439
 write something 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:41.090
 and as you see it recognizes it as it is 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.750
 we often say words in English 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:48.130
 terms in English will not recognize them 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.130
 so you have to tell everything in Spanish 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.180
 that is 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.020
 a tip would be is when they prevail twice 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.770
 those of its function 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.630
 they say what they are going to say they dictate and the 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:07.409
 press again to cancel 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.409
 wait for them to recognize ok another example 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.840
 economizer 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:20.150
 in this case he recognized me economized 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.770
 but then he had very very very close another 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.130
 use when we close preferences of 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.820
 system 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.820
 the show 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.590
 we improve words 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.470
 and also here we can write there was a 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.510
 program in windows 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.140
 very professional that was called dragon 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.410
 speaker 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.690
 This is free and very similar 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:52.910
 they do not have to spend a lot of money on 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:55.830
 that for example let's write 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:59.150
 that would be good 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.150
 subscribe if the channel 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:07.560
 and ready as well as they see whether they want 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:11.820
 pass a book pass it to word do not have 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.140
 scanner or X thing can do it from 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.690
 this way 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.520
 and well I hope you liked it 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.650

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.580
 Little birds is a fan that is 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.030
