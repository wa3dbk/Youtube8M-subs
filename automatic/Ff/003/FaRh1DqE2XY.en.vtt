holder power to the device we put the
battery<00:00:19.080> in<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.740> we're<00:00:20.070> going<00:00:20.189> to<00:00:20.250> scroll

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
battery in and we're going to scroll

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.279 
battery in and we're going to scroll
through<00:00:21.050> the<00:00:22.050> settings<00:00:23.000> to<00:00:24.000> make<00:00:24.180> sure

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 
through the settings to make sure

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.109 
through the settings to make sure
everything<00:00:25.289> is<00:00:25.439> set<00:00:25.800> correctly<00:00:25.830> as<00:00:26.730> you<00:00:26.970> can

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
everything is set correctly as you can

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.630 
everything is set correctly as you can
see<00:00:27.390> it's<00:00:27.599> come<00:00:27.930> up<00:00:28.080> with<00:00:28.320> its<00:00:28.529> own<00:00:28.740> time<00:00:29.279> and

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
see it's come up with its own time and

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.150 
see it's come up with its own time and
day<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.689> week<00:00:31.279> so<00:00:32.279> I'm<00:00:32.460> going<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:32.669> set<00:00:32.969> that

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
day of the week so I'm going to set that

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:43.190 
day of the week so I'm going to set that
first<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:36.710> am<00:00:37.710> going<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:40.280> look<00:00:41.280> for<00:00:41.690> that<00:00:42.690> you

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
first I am going to look for that you

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.310 
first I am going to look for that you
might<00:00:43.379> want<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.649> cut<00:00:44.219> there<00:00:44.489> in<00:00:45.079> so<00:00:46.079> I'm<00:00:46.140> going

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
might want to cut there in so I'm going

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.760 
might want to cut there in so I'm going
to<00:00:46.350> scroll<00:00:46.770> through<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.250> time<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.789> day<00:00:48.770> which

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
to scroll through the time of day which

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.819 
to scroll through the time of day which
I<00:00:50.010> don't<00:00:50.250> really<00:00:50.640> know<00:00:50.820> what<00:00:51.030> time<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:54.829> so

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
I don't really know what time it is so

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.430 
I don't really know what time it is so
we're<00:00:56.070> going<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.250> program<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:57.210> for<00:00:57.649> 150<00:01:00.440> moving

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
we're going to program it for 150 moving

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.420 
we're going to program it for 150 moving
the<00:01:01.559> arrow<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:02.129> get<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.760> next<00:01:03.059> section<00:01:03.660> on

the arrow to get to the next section on

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.660 
the arrow to get to the next section on
the<00:01:05.430> same<00:01:05.760> page<00:01:06.270> we'll<00:01:07.229> call<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.950> using

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
the same page we'll call it and using

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.300 
the same page we'll call it and using
the<00:01:08.939> minus<00:01:09.450> key<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:10.140> take<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.590> two<00:01:10.860> minutes

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
the minus key to take the two minutes

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.260 
the minus key to take the two minutes
off<00:01:12.799> and<00:01:13.799> then<00:01:14.010> we're<00:01:14.189> going<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.400> change<00:01:14.850> the

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
off and then we're going to change the

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.870 
off and then we're going to change the
mode<00:01:15.570> now<00:01:16.049> we've<00:01:16.259> set<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.650> time<00:01:16.890> it's<00:01:17.159> 1:50

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
mode now we've set the time it's 1:50

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.620 
mode now we've set the time it's 1:50
p.m.<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:19.140> I'm<00:01:19.229> going<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.409> use<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.770> mode<00:01:20.130> key<00:01:20.880> to

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
p.m. so I'm going to use the mode key to

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.780 
p.m. so I'm going to use the mode key to
roll<00:01:22.020> through<00:01:23.000> the<00:01:24.000> different<00:01:24.479> sections<00:01:25.350> here

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
roll through the different sections here

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.010 
roll through the different sections here
so<00:01:26.790> now<00:01:27.000> we<00:01:27.060> should<00:01:27.509> be<00:01:27.659> going<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:29.509> the<00:01:30.509> time<00:01:30.780> is

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
so now we should be going to the time is

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.240 
so now we should be going to the time is
set<00:01:31.520> go<00:01:32.520> down<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.840> duration<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.860> this<00:01:35.100> is

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
set go down to the duration so this is

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.990 
set go down to the duration so this is
the<00:01:35.400> time<00:01:35.640> in<00:01:35.909> which<00:01:36.409> the<00:01:37.579> manifold<00:01:38.579> will<00:01:38.820> be

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
the time in which the manifold will be

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.510 
the time in which the manifold will be
open<00:01:39.540> for<00:01:40.020> watering<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:40.740> as<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:41.040> can<00:01:41.130> see<00:01:41.189> it's

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
open for watering so as you can see it's

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.210 
open for watering so as you can see it's
set<00:01:41.759> for<00:01:42.000> five<00:01:42.240> minutes<00:01:42.799> we're<00:01:43.799> going<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:43.979> set

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
set for five minutes we're going to set

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.420 
set for five minutes we're going to set
this<00:01:44.369> drip<00:01:44.790> irrigation<00:01:45.509> off<00:01:46.020> for<00:01:46.409> an<00:01:46.500> hour<00:01:46.770> so

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
this drip irrigation off for an hour so

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.410 
this drip irrigation off for an hour so
now<00:01:47.670> we're<00:01:48.180> on<00:01:48.979> the<00:01:49.979> time<00:01:50.310> duration<00:01:50.790> I'm<00:01:51.210> going

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
now we're on the time duration I'm going

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.510 
now we're on the time duration I'm going
to<00:01:51.479> put<00:01:51.689> an<00:01:51.840> hour<00:01:52.140> in<00:01:52.560> I'm<00:01:52.950> going<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.189> move

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
to put an hour in I'm going to move

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.450 
to put an hour in I'm going to move
forward<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.960> minutes<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.740> I'm<00:01:56.159> going<00:01:56.369> to

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
forward to the minutes and I'm going to

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.149 
forward to the minutes and I'm going to
reduce<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:57.210> five<00:01:57.450> minutes<00:01:58.140> in<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.860> pre

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
reduce the five minutes in the pre

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.280 
reduce the five minutes in the pre
program<00:02:00.110> to<00:02:01.110> one<00:02:01.350> hour<00:02:02.030> so<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.240> duration<00:02:03.630> is

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
program to one hour so the duration is

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.560 
program to one hour so the duration is
for<00:02:04.560> an<00:02:04.649> hour<00:02:04.890> now<00:02:05.670> we're<00:02:05.820> going<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.030> change

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
for an hour now we're going to change

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.210 
for an hour now we're going to change
the<00:02:07.560> mode<00:02:07.770> once<00:02:08.069> again

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
the mode once again

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.820 
the mode once again
to<00:02:09.490> choose<00:02:09.910> the<00:02:10.360> days<00:02:10.660> of<00:02:10.930> the<00:02:11.080> week<00:02:11.260> in<00:02:11.650> which

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
to choose the days of the week in which

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.390 
to choose the days of the week in which
we<00:02:12.220> want<00:02:12.460> watering<00:02:13.030> to<00:02:13.240> occur<00:02:13.630> so<00:02:14.160> as<00:02:15.160> you<00:02:15.310> can

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.950 
that'll move me into Tuesday so now that
I'm<00:02:32.170> into<00:02:32.500> Tuesday<00:02:33.310> I<00:02:33.340> would<00:02:34.000> rather<00:02:34.630> not

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
I'm into Tuesday I would rather not

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.020 
I'm into Tuesday I would rather not
water<00:02:35.380> every<00:02:35.830> day<00:02:35.980> but<00:02:36.040> how<00:02:36.400> about<00:02:36.610> every

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
water every day but how about every

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.550 
water every day but how about every
other<00:02:37.210> day<00:02:37.930> so<00:02:38.560> I<00:02:39.490> will<00:02:40.000> use<00:02:40.240> the<00:02:40.450> minus<00:02:40.960> key<00:02:40.990> I

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
other day so I will use the minus key I

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.940 
other day so I will use the minus key I
believe<00:02:41.950> in<00:02:42.250> order<00:02:42.400> to<00:02:42.700> move<00:02:43.360> along<00:02:43.950> to

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
believe in order to move along to

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.580 
believe in order to move along to
Wednesday<00:02:45.580> now<00:02:46.540> we're<00:02:46.750> on<00:02:46.810> Wednesday<00:02:47.320> we're

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
Wednesday now we're on Wednesday we're

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.050 
Wednesday now we're on Wednesday we're
going<00:02:47.620> to<00:02:47.770> choose<00:02:48.010> to<00:02:48.250> water<00:02:48.490> so<00:02:48.790> I'm<00:02:48.880> going<00:02:49.000> to

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
going to choose to water so I'm going to

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.510 
going to choose to water so I'm going to
use<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.300> plus<00:02:49.570> key<00:02:49.900> to<00:02:50.380> activate<00:02:50.920> Wednesday

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
use the plus key to activate Wednesday

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.330 
use the plus key to activate Wednesday
once<00:02:52.450> again<00:02:52.600> it's<00:02:52.930> moved<00:02:53.110> along<00:02:53.410> to<00:02:53.680> Thursday

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
once again it's moved along to Thursday

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.120 
once again it's moved along to Thursday
and<00:02:54.610> I'm<00:02:54.850> going<00:02:55.030> to<00:02:55.060> minus<00:02:55.630> it<00:02:55.840> and<00:02:56.770> it's<00:02:56.950> going

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
and I'm going to minus it and it's going

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.430 
and I'm going to minus it and it's going
to<00:02:57.220> move<00:02:57.400> to<00:02:57.610> Friday<00:02:57.940> and<00:02:58.450> I'm<00:02:58.930> going<00:02:59.170> to<00:02:59.200> add

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
to move to Friday and I'm going to add

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.720 
to move to Friday and I'm going to add
Friday<00:03:00.400> as<00:03:00.820> a<00:03:00.850> plus<00:03:01.860> so<00:03:02.860> at<00:03:02.980> this<00:03:03.100> point<00:03:03.340> we<00:03:03.580> can

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
Friday as a plus so at this point we can

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.910 
Friday as a plus so at this point we can
either<00:03:03.910> do<00:03:04.209> three<00:03:04.840> days<00:03:05.020> a<00:03:05.050> week<00:03:05.200> or<00:03:05.530> four<00:03:05.770> days

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
either do three days a week or four days

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.449 
either do three days a week or four days
a<00:03:05.950> week<00:03:06.100> all<00:03:06.610> and<00:03:06.940> so<00:03:07.570> we<00:03:08.050> will<00:03:08.230> choose<00:03:08.530> 2<00:03:10.380> minus

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
a week all and so we will choose 2 minus

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:17.400 
a week all and so we will choose 2 minus
Saturday<00:03:12.459> and<00:03:13.680> activate<00:03:14.680> Sunday<00:03:16.110> so<00:03:17.110> as<00:03:17.230> you

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
Saturday and activate Sunday so as you

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.070 
Saturday and activate Sunday so as you
can<00:03:17.530> see<00:03:17.590> now<00:03:18.160> the<00:03:18.220> days<00:03:18.880> are<00:03:19.080> Monday

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
can see now the days are Monday

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.030 
can see now the days are Monday
Wednesday<00:03:20.860> friday-sunday<00:03:22.440> we<00:03:23.440> use<00:03:23.590> the<00:03:23.769> mode

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
Wednesday friday-sunday we use the mode

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.600 
Wednesday friday-sunday we use the mode
key<00:03:24.459> for<00:03:25.360> finish<00:03:25.750> there<00:03:26.019> to<00:03:26.769> get<00:03:26.980> down<00:03:27.250> to

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
key for finish there to get down to

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.300 
key for finish there to get down to
starts<00:03:28.540> which<00:03:28.870> refers<00:03:29.260> to<00:03:29.290> the<00:03:29.590> starting<00:03:30.040> time

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
starts which refers to the starting time

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:36.540 
starts which refers to the starting time
of<00:03:30.640> the<00:03:30.820> program<00:03:34.019> so<00:03:35.019> as<00:03:35.170> you<00:03:35.350> can<00:03:35.500> see<00:03:35.800> there

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
of the program so as you can see there

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.720 
of the program so as you can see there
is<00:03:36.900> we're<00:03:37.900> into<00:03:38.260> the<00:03:38.590> start<00:03:39.070> times<00:03:39.340> of<00:03:39.640> the

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
is we're into the start times of the

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.050 
is we're into the start times of the
program<00:03:40.180> and<00:03:40.390> it<00:03:40.480> says<00:03:40.900> start<00:03:41.560> one<00:03:41.950> now<00:03:42.730> this

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
program and it says start one now this

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
program and it says start one now this
timer<00:03:43.510> has<00:03:43.900> four<00:03:44.350> separate<00:03:45.130> programs<00:03:45.840> but<00:03:46.840> we

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
timer has four separate programs but we

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.130 
timer has four separate programs but we
will<00:03:47.290> be<00:03:47.410> just<00:03:47.680> activating<00:03:48.519> program<00:03:49.390> one<00:03:49.810> and

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
will be just activating program one and

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.039 
will be just activating program one and
as<00:03:50.620> you<00:03:50.650> can<00:03:50.920> see<00:03:51.160> it's<00:03:51.310> off<00:03:51.489> and<00:03:52.299> we<00:03:52.750> want<00:03:52.959> to

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
as you can see it's off and we want to

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.500 
as you can see it's off and we want to
change<00:03:53.380> that<00:03:53.739> we<00:03:54.160> would<00:03:54.640> like<00:03:54.790> to<00:03:54.820> change<00:03:55.150> that

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
change that we would like to change that

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.350 
change that we would like to change that
to<00:03:55.870> on<00:03:56.310> so<00:03:57.310> I<00:03:57.370> believe<00:03:57.730> we're<00:03:58.000> going<00:03:58.120> to<00:03:58.209> use

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
to on so I believe we're going to use

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.640 
to on so I believe we're going to use
the<00:03:58.690> plus<00:03:59.049> key<00:03:59.380> to<00:03:59.739> activate<00:04:00.370> that<00:04:01.380> now<00:04:02.380> it's

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
the plus key to activate that now it's

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.060 
the plus key to activate that now it's
showing<00:04:02.950> at<00:04:03.250> what<00:04:03.459> time<00:04:04.140> the<00:04:05.140> program<00:04:05.830> will

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
showing at what time the program will

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.280 
showing at what time the program will
start<00:04:06.340> so<00:04:06.610> that's<00:04:06.790> at<00:04:07.000> 12<00:04:07.330> a.m.<00:04:07.600> which<00:04:08.049> is<00:04:08.080> a

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
start so that's at 12 a.m. which is a

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.509 
start so that's at 12 a.m. which is a
bit<00:04:08.530> of<00:04:08.620> the<00:04:08.709> middle<00:04:08.950> of<00:04:08.980> the<00:04:09.100> night<00:04:09.280> we'll

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
bit of the middle of the night we'll

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.270 
bit of the middle of the night we'll
probably<00:04:09.760> go<00:04:10.239> for<00:04:10.510> early-morning<00:04:11.170> I<00:04:11.920> would

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
probably go for early-morning I would

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:19.099 
probably go for early-morning I would
imagine<00:04:13.980> so<00:04:14.980> we<00:04:15.220> will<00:04:15.519> go

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:28.600 

into<00:04:19.739> 8<00:04:23.599> so<00:04:24.599> we'll<00:04:24.720> reduce<00:04:24.960> that<00:04:25.500> oh<00:04:25.860> I'll<00:04:26.849> keep

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
into 8 so we'll reduce that oh I'll keep

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.330 
into 8 so we'll reduce that oh I'll keep
alright<00:04:29.610> might<00:04:30.539> want<00:04:30.719> to<00:04:30.750> pause<00:04:30.960> as<00:04:31.919> you<00:04:32.189> can

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
alright might want to pause as you can

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.240 
alright might want to pause as you can
see<00:04:32.550> the<00:04:32.969> program<00:04:33.419> 1<00:04:33.629> is<00:04:33.870> off<00:04:34.139> and<00:04:34.680> I'm<00:04:35.099> going

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
see the program 1 is off and I'm going

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.320 
see the program 1 is off and I'm going
to<00:04:35.310> use<00:04:35.460> the<00:04:35.639> minus<00:04:36.180> key<00:04:36.560> and<00:04:37.909> possibly<00:04:38.909> twice

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
to use the minus key and possibly twice

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.679 
to use the minus key and possibly twice
to<00:04:39.750> activate<00:04:40.349> the<00:04:40.530> time<00:04:40.800> so<00:04:41.729> now<00:04:41.939> we're<00:04:42.150> at<00:04:42.240> 11

00:04:42.679 --> 00:04:42.689 
to activate the time so now we're at 11

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:46.700 
to activate the time so now we're at 11
p.m.<00:04:42.990> I<00:04:43.469> am<00:04:44.460> going<00:04:44.879> to<00:04:45.060> go<00:04:45.210> and<00:04:45.990> keep<00:04:46.379> reducing

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
p.m. I am going to go and keep reducing

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.080 
p.m. I am going to go and keep reducing
or<00:04:47.490> go<00:04:47.669> backwards<00:04:48.629> oh<00:04:49.370> there<00:04:50.370> we<00:04:50.580> are<00:04:50.610> now

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
or go backwards oh there we are now

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.360 
or go backwards oh there we are now
we're<00:04:51.300> into<00:04:51.539> the<00:04:51.569> AMS<00:04:52.500> we've<00:04:52.860> rolled<00:04:53.129> through

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
we're into the AMS we've rolled through

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:54.439 
we're into the AMS we've rolled through
the<00:04:53.520> 12<00:04:53.759> hours

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 
the 12 hours

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:58.309 
the 12 hours
now<00:04:54.930> we're<00:04:55.110> doing<00:04:55.349> 8<00:04:56.360> 7<00:04:57.389> probably<00:04:57.930> more<00:04:58.110> like<00:04:58.169> a

00:04:58.309 --> 00:04:58.319 
now we're doing 8 7 probably more like a

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:03.649 
now we're doing 8 7 probably more like a
6<00:04:58.770> a.m.<00:04:59.099> 8<00:04:59.669> 8<00:05:00.539> we're<00:05:00.810> going<00:05:00.840> for<00:05:01.229> 8<00:05:02.479> so<00:05:03.479> we're

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:03.659 
6 a.m. 8 8 we're going for 8 so we're

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:07.339 
6 a.m. 8 8 we're going for 8 so we're
going<00:05:03.840> for<00:05:04.080> an<00:05:04.169> 8<00:05:04.379> a.m.<00:05:04.650> start<00:05:05.310> on<00:05:06.020> program<00:05:07.020> 1

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:07.349 
going for an 8 a.m. start on program 1

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:10.670 
going for an 8 a.m. start on program 1
and<00:05:08.090> then<00:05:09.090> that<00:05:09.360> is<00:05:09.659> set<00:05:09.990> so<00:05:10.319> we're<00:05:10.500> going<00:05:10.590> to

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
and then that is set so we're going to

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.610 
and then that is set so we're going to
use<00:05:10.860> the<00:05:11.069> mode<00:05:11.310> key<00:05:11.759> to<00:05:12.389> continue<00:05:12.930> on<00:05:13.110> rolling

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
use the mode key to continue on rolling

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.800 
use the mode key to continue on rolling
through<00:05:13.949> the<00:05:13.979> different<00:05:14.639> levels<00:05:17.240> so<00:05:18.240> now<00:05:18.479> it's

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
through the different levels so now it's

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.640 
through the different levels so now it's
telling<00:05:19.050> us<00:05:19.349> that<00:05:19.710> the<00:05:20.389> program<00:05:21.389> 2<00:05:21.810> as<00:05:22.169> in

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650 
telling us that the program 2 as in

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.629 
telling us that the program 2 as in
start<00:05:23.099> -<00:05:23.370> is<00:05:23.789> off<00:05:24.330> and<00:05:24.690> that's<00:05:24.960> correct<00:05:25.639> this

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 
start - is off and that's correct this

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.369 
start - is off and that's correct this
is<00:05:26.819> where<00:05:26.969> it<00:05:27.090> can<00:05:27.210> get<00:05:27.360> complicated<00:05:27.569> where

00:05:28.369 --> 00:05:28.379 
is where it can get complicated where

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:34.269 
is where it can get complicated where
you<00:05:28.560> can<00:05:28.830> program<00:05:29.279> it<00:05:29.759> for<00:05:30.090> multiple<00:05:32.419> watering

00:05:34.269 --> 00:05:34.279 
you can program it for multiple watering

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:37.850 
you can program it for multiple watering
sessions<00:05:35.279> on<00:05:35.729> different<00:05:36.419> programs<00:05:36.860> depending

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
sessions on different programs depending

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.670 
sessions on different programs depending
on<00:05:37.979> how<00:05:38.159> specific<00:05:38.759> your<00:05:38.940> needs<00:05:39.360> are<00:05:39.599> so<00:05:40.440> we

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
on how specific your needs are so we

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.200 
on how specific your needs are so we
will<00:05:41.099> not<00:05:41.279> be<00:05:41.339> using<00:05:42.889> start<00:05:43.889> -<00:05:44.219> we<00:05:44.849> won't<00:05:45.029> be

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
will not be using start - we won't be

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.329 
will not be using start - we won't be
using<00:05:45.389> the<00:05:45.599> program<00:05:45.960> -<00:05:46.229> and<00:05:46.529> as<00:05:47.009> you<00:05:47.190> can<00:05:47.279> see

using the program - and as you can see

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:49.670 
using the program - and as you can see
if<00:05:47.669> rolled<00:05:47.909> through<00:05:48.240> using<00:05:48.509> the<00:05:48.750> mode<00:05:48.960> key<00:05:49.289> we

if rolled through using the mode key we

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.760 
if rolled through using the mode key we

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
and that's it it's 1:55 p.m. we've just

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.019 
and that's it it's 1:55 p.m. we've just
noticed<00:06:08.310> that<00:06:09.589> it<00:06:10.589> is<00:06:10.800> the<00:06:10.949> wrong<00:06:11.129> day<00:06:11.610> which

00:06:12.019 --> 00:06:12.029 
noticed that it is the wrong day which

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:15.619 
noticed that it is the wrong day which
is<00:06:12.210> occurring<00:06:12.569> on<00:06:13.050> the<00:06:13.169> time<00:06:14.009> panel<00:06:14.639> and<00:06:14.849> so

00:06:15.619 --> 00:06:15.629 
is occurring on the time panel and so

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:19.430 
is occurring on the time panel and so
we're<00:06:15.870> going<00:06:16.110> to<00:06:16.759> go<00:06:17.759> through<00:06:18.319> once<00:06:19.319> again

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 
we're going to go through once again

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.409 
we're going to go through once again
we're<00:06:19.889> in<00:06:19.979> the<00:06:20.009> time<00:06:20.339> mode<00:06:20.729> and<00:06:21.120> we're<00:06:21.270> going

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:21.419 
we're in the time mode and we're going

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:24.409 
we're in the time mode and we're going

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:24.419 
to scroll forward into the minutes and

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:26.329 
to scroll forward into the minutes and
then<00:06:24.900> we're<00:06:25.020> going<00:06:25.110> to<00:06:25.169> scroll<00:06:25.529> forward<00:06:25.860> again

00:06:26.329 --> 00:06:26.339 
then we're going to scroll forward again

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:30.079 
then we're going to scroll forward again
and<00:06:26.639> if<00:06:27.120> you'll<00:06:27.270> notice<00:06:27.360> up<00:06:27.990> at<00:06:28.080> the<00:06:28.139> top<00:06:29.089> the

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:37.180 
to do is we are going to move it along

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.930 
to do is we are going to move it along

Saturday at 1:56 and then we're going to

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:45.890 
Saturday at 1:56 and then we're going to
continue<00:06:43.960> on<00:06:44.410> and<00:06:44.800> get<00:06:45.010> out<00:06:45.040> of<00:06:45.370> that<00:06:45.520> mode

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:06.220 
back to the running screen so we just

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:08.190 
back to the running screen so we just
didn't<00:07:06.430> want<00:07:06.490> to<00:07:06.790> leave<00:07:07.000> out<00:07:07.270> that<00:07:07.720> in<00:07:08.020> order

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:08.200 
didn't want to leave out that in order

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.150 
didn't want to leave out that in order

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:12.160 
to emanuelly turn on the system so you

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.010 
to emanuelly turn on the system so you
can<00:07:12.340> check<00:07:12.550> everything<00:07:13.060> or<00:07:13.360> in<00:07:13.630> extreme

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:14.020 
can check everything or in extreme

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:20.240 
can check everything or in extreme
weather<00:07:14.230> you<00:07:15.010> can<00:07:15.250> use<00:07:15.550> the<00:07:16.150> hand<00:07:16.830> pointer<00:07:17.830> key

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:27.160 

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:34.010 

again<00:07:30.510> just<00:07:31.510> like<00:07:31.780> that

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:34.020 
again just like that

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.630 
again just like that
