00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
completely went away I thought there was

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.660 
completely went away I thought there was
pollen<00:03:31.440> like<00:03:31.590> permanently<00:03:32.010> stuck<00:03:32.280> in<00:03:32.430> it<00:03:32.549> but

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
pollen like permanently stuck in it but

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.340 
pollen like permanently stuck in it but
it<00:03:32.910> wasn't<00:03:33.239> it<00:03:33.329> went<00:03:33.660> all<00:03:33.750> straight<00:03:34.019> to<00:03:34.140> black

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
it wasn't it went all straight to black

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.960 
it wasn't it went all straight to black
ones<00:03:34.650> like<00:03:34.799> pollens<00:03:35.190> it's<00:03:35.459> kind<00:03:35.730> of<00:03:35.790> died<00:03:35.940> down

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
ones like pollens it's kind of died down

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.509 
ones like pollens it's kind of died down
now<00:03:36.180> it's<00:03:37.079> still<00:03:37.260> a<00:03:37.320> little<00:03:37.620> bit<00:03:37.829> out<00:03:37.950> there<00:03:37.980> so

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
now it's still a little bit out there so

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.880 
now it's still a little bit out there so
but<00:03:39.120> I<00:03:39.180> mean<00:03:39.480> it<00:03:39.720> didn't<00:03:39.989> stick<00:03:40.200> so<00:03:40.410> I<00:03:40.650> wouldn't

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
but I mean it didn't stick so I wouldn't

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.789 
but I mean it didn't stick so I wouldn't
even<00:03:40.950> mind<00:03:41.160> doing<00:03:41.430> now<00:03:41.870> again<00:03:42.870> because<00:03:43.260> you

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
even mind doing now again because you

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.220 
even mind doing now again because you
know<00:03:43.890> it<00:03:44.010> all<00:03:44.130> came<00:03:44.310> out<00:03:44.430> like<00:03:44.790> no<00:03:45.030> problem<00:03:45.360> but

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
know it all came out like no problem but

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.960 
know it all came out like no problem but
the<00:03:46.290> pollen<00:03:46.769> was<00:03:46.980> absolutely<00:03:47.430> no<00:03:47.519> problem<00:03:47.880> the

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
the pollen was absolutely no problem the

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.069 
the pollen was absolutely no problem the
only<00:03:48.150> thing<00:03:48.269> that<00:03:48.390> kind<00:03:48.540> of<00:03:48.600> bothered<00:03:48.900> me<00:03:48.930> is

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
only thing that kind of bothered me is

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:50.360 
only thing that kind of bothered me is
that<00:03:49.170> there<00:03:49.290> were<00:03:49.350> a<00:03:49.410> few<00:03:49.560> imperfections<00:03:49.860> I

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
that there were a few imperfections I

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.759 
that there were a few imperfections I
could<00:03:50.760> have<00:03:50.850> done<00:03:51.000> better<00:03:51.180> I<00:03:51.989> don't<00:03:52.560> know<00:03:52.650> if<00:03:52.739> I

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
could have done better I don't know if I

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.259 
could have done better I don't know if I
told<00:03:52.950> the<00:03:53.070> story<00:03:53.340> of<00:03:53.400> how<00:03:53.549> when<00:03:53.700> I<00:03:53.730> plas<00:03:54.000> seated

told the story of how when I plas seated
for<00:03:54.360> my<00:03:54.420> wheels<00:03:54.630> but<00:03:55.320> I<00:03:55.350> was<00:03:55.650> like<00:03:55.860> in<00:03:56.100> the

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
for my wheels but I was like in the

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.670 
for my wheels but I was like in the
worst<00:03:56.549> possible<00:03:56.760> conditions<00:03:57.209> I<00:03:57.750> started<00:03:58.560> it

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
worst possible conditions I started it

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.350 
worst possible conditions I started it
at<00:03:58.799> like<00:03:58.890> six<00:03:59.280> o'clock<00:03:59.579> at<00:03:59.730> night<00:03:59.880> so<00:04:00.120> right

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
at like six o'clock at night so right

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.690 
at like six o'clock at night so right
before<00:04:00.510> it<00:04:00.750> turned<00:04:00.930> dark<00:04:01.049> a<00:04:01.950> completely

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
before it turned dark a completely

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.039 
before it turned dark a completely
stupid<00:04:02.880> idea<00:04:03.180> if<00:04:03.269> you<00:04:03.329> ever<00:04:03.420> imply<00:04:03.690> seated<00:04:03.989> the

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
stupid idea if you ever imply seated the

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:05.449 
stupid idea if you ever imply seated the
wheels<00:04:04.230> of<00:04:04.350> your<00:04:04.410> car<00:04:04.530> don't<00:04:04.890> do<00:04:05.070> it<00:04:05.190> right

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
wheels of your car don't do it right

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.160 
maybe do another quick little video or

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.260 
maybe do another quick little video or
something<00:06:30.280> on<00:06:30.580> it<00:06:30.700> when<00:06:30.820> it's<00:06:30.940> been<00:06:31.090> done

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.270 
something on it when it's been done

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:32.730 
something on it when it's been done
again<00:06:31.510> maybe<00:06:31.720> I'll<00:06:31.870> actually<00:06:31.960> a<00:06:32.440> good<00:06:32.650> idea

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:32.740 
again maybe I'll actually a good idea

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.200

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:34.210 
would probably be to do a video of me

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:35.760 
would probably be to do a video of me
showing<00:06:34.420> how<00:06:34.570> to<00:06:34.600> do<00:06:34.810> it<00:06:34.930> in<00:06:35.230> case<00:06:35.470> any<00:06:35.650> of<00:06:35.710> you
