 About Statistics 4 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.390
 Now, as the last time I explain a little more about the practice methods 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:34.030
 I will. 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:40.659
 So a good practice way is to play the metronome in the 4 , 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:42.250
 According indeyo its practice how to rattle him a king now to me once mass Rune 

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:46.890
 So now 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.890
 4 hanbakja just playing one by one 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:01:00.740
 Practice your private db eb eve and then 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.740
 I'll try two of them. 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:11.060
 We 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.060
 4 In this way, the four 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:22.370
 danawa 4 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.370
 on aol 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:32.420
 4 In this way, my practice is to teach you what 4 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:37.700
 That tempo is so good that you can practice it well. 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:40.130
 Yes, if you practice like that, you can make 4 tong kings freely. 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.220
 Because we can control it 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.430
 Practice to match the metronome 4 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:51.979
 As there, I think you are in parallel 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:56.200
 And one of them is a little bit of practice now, but my one more 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.200
 I will explain 4 5
