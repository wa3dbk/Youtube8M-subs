00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:15.330
 Hello UTB crazy Quaid today I 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.400
 show you how to make a glass of water 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.020
 tool from scratch and decorate it 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.730
 very pretty pattern 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.340
 for work we need polymer 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.680
 fimo clay green for base and 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.109
 many colors to choose from for fimo decor 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.900
 gel super-glue scissors blades and 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.309
 ball modeling tool at the end 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.770
 aluminum soda can 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.200
 a sheet of white paper to begin to measure 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.149
 sheet in girth banks and in height to 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.809
 create a base for plastic tight 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.000
 we wrap a sheet of paper jar and 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.860
 glue the ends of the sheet glue I do not advise 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.210
 use the tape as it will later 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.210
 difficult to separate from him a wedge 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:05.340
 now we roll a layer of green 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.340
 cut off the edges and wrap our jar with them 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.610
 cut off excess rubbing the junction 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.360
 wet napkin we pass around 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:55.990
 plastic perimeter to remove dust particles 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.479
 mote 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.030
 and bake fingerprints right on 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.220
 bank, meanwhile, roll out the sausages 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.560
 our selected colors are cut into 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.369
 small pieces and from them we ride a lot 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.420
 many balls 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:09.420
 indecent much 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.140
 Now we take out the jar and separate 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:28.849
 paper from plastic all these elements 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.849
 quite simply separated from each other 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.129
 roll out a small layer of green 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.530
 colors we put our cup on it 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:40.290
 a little press and cut along the contour 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.569
 it will be our bottom is separated from 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:52.500
 table surface and rub the junction 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:54.150
 we send on baking we grease ours 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:03:02.579
 a glass of fimo gel and start 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:04.410
 decorate with modeling 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:06.269
 tool ball on the end i 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.430
 spread balls in pattern I 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:11.220
 it turns out a mixture of filigree technique and 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.780
 Imitation spot painting me very 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.909
 like similar motives 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.590
 perhaps because the school year in 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:19.290
 I was like only painted 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.359
 cup importantly observe the same 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.250
 distances between points and between rows 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:26.060
 then you will get harmonious 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.060
 neat pattern 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.810
 I baked in several stages so as not to 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.640
 break the foil drawing i made for 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.920
 underlays in the form of boats to be 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.960
 it is convenient to bake a glass on the side not 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.090
 ruining him and after he 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.130
 bake i'm pulling hot 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.680
 a glass and so that it does not deform 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:03.020
 I imagine a little bank in it 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.120
 way until it cools down, we at the expense of 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.910
 cans in our glass will not lose shape 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.790
 here is a nice cozy addition possible 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.620
 settle your workshop or make 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.270
 together with the child such a cup for 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.280
 stationery 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:19.070
 I think children definitely will not give up on such 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:21.280
 an amusing pastime and even with 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:24.740
 such a pleasant president as a result 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.900
 dare try create if you 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.150
 like my master class like 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:32.590
 subscribe to the channel and crazy 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.590
