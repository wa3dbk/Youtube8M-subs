first<00:00:51.030> mistake<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.570> guys<00:00:51.780> doing<00:00:51.930> as<00:00:52.079> a

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
first mistake this guys doing as a

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.630 
first mistake this guys doing as a
jungler<00:00:52.410> he's<00:00:52.680> taking<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.129> double<00:00:53.460> goals

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
jungler he's taking the double goals

jungler he's taking the double goals
from<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.989> bot<00:00:55.140> Lane<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:56.250> reason<00:00:56.399> why

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
from the bot Lane and the reason why

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.760 
from the bot Lane and the reason why
this<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:57.120> bad<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.629> because<00:00:57.930> let's<00:00:58.680> say

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
this is bad is because let's say

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.099 
this is bad is because let's say
hypothetically<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.579> Nidalee<00:00:59.989> soloed<00:01:00.989> her

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
hypothetically the Nidalee soloed her

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.479 
hypothetically the Nidalee soloed her
blue<00:01:01.350> which<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.590> something<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.980> lot<00:01:02.070> in<00:01:02.219> Italy's

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
blue which is something a lot in Italy's

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.210 
blue which is something a lot in Italy's
do<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:02.989> these<00:01:03.989> people<00:01:04.350> got<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.710> camp<00:01:05.040> and

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
do and these people got the camp and

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.160 
do and these people got the camp and
they<00:01:05.280> had<00:01:05.400> left<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.270> XP<00:01:06.659> advantage<00:01:06.990> off

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
they had left the the XP advantage off

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.800 
they had left the the XP advantage off
of<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:07.409> they<00:01:07.770> would<00:01:07.920> be<00:01:07.950> almost<00:01:08.540> both<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.689> them

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
of it they would be almost both of them

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.300 
of it they would be almost both of them
would<00:01:09.930> be<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.049> half<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.409> level<00:01:10.560> ahead<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:10.979> us<00:01:11.100> and

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
would be a half a level ahead of us and

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.640 
would be a half a level ahead of us and
they<00:01:11.400> could<00:01:11.549> really<00:01:12.030> bully<00:01:12.530> they<00:01:13.530> could

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
they could really bully they could

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.840 
they could really bully they could
really<00:01:13.830> bully<00:01:14.040> our<00:01:14.189> lane<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.520> they<00:01:14.640> knew<00:01:14.760> how

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
really bully our lane that they knew how

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.100 
really bully our lane that they knew how
to<00:01:14.909> impress<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:15.270> advantage<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.930> we'd

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
to impress that advantage and we'd

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.080 
to impress that advantage and we'd
always<00:01:16.470> be<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.799> half<00:01:16.979> level<00:01:17.280> behind<00:01:17.400> so<00:01:17.790> by

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
always be a half level behind so by

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.210 
always be a half level behind so by
taking<00:01:18.299> these<00:01:18.659> double<00:01:19.320> columns<00:01:19.560> you're

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
taking these double columns you're

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.850 
taking these double columns you're
basically<00:01:20.430> making<00:01:21.030> your<00:01:21.840> bot<00:01:22.020> Lane<00:01:22.259> instantly

what<00:02:04.979> actually<00:02:05.280> happens<00:02:05.640> in<00:02:05.759> this<00:02:06.079> will<00:02:07.079> speed

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
what actually happens in this will speed

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.330 
what actually happens in this will speed
this<00:02:07.500> up<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.770> little<00:02:07.890> bit

here<00:02:49.760> he<00:02:50.239> could<00:02:50.450> have<00:02:50.540> let<00:02:50.720> quirky<00:02:51.620> and<00:02:51.830> Thresh

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
here he could have let quirky and Thresh

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.650 
here he could have let quirky and Thresh
get<00:02:52.430> the<00:02:52.550> double<00:02:52.820> goals<00:02:52.970> here<00:02:53.239> on<00:02:53.390> their<00:02:53.540> own

get the double goals here on their own

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.930 
get the double goals here on their own
and<00:02:53.840> he<00:02:54.350> can<00:02:54.530> solo<00:02:54.830> red<00:02:55.130> buff<00:02:55.310> it's<00:02:55.580> not<00:02:55.760> like

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
and he can solo red buff it's not like

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.580 
and he can solo red buff it's not like
as<00:02:56.150> efficient<00:02:56.720> of<00:02:56.780> a<00:02:56.900> clear<00:02:57.140> but<00:02:57.319> pretty<00:02:57.530> much

bad<00:03:11.840> because<00:03:12.260> when<00:03:12.380> you<00:03:12.440> smite<00:03:12.739> it<00:03:12.920> you<00:03:13.489> get

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
bad because when you smite it you get

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.940 
bad because when you smite it you get
back<00:03:13.850> oh<00:03:14.090> you<00:03:14.810> know<00:03:14.930> a<00:03:14.959> portion<00:03:15.769> of<00:03:15.829> your

back oh you know a portion of your
missing<00:03:16.280> held<00:03:16.459> so<00:03:16.760> it's<00:03:16.940> actually<00:03:17.269> not<00:03:17.360> that

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
missing held so it's actually not that

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.640 
missing held so it's actually not that
bad<00:03:17.600> for<00:03:17.750> you<00:03:17.930> clear<00:03:18.170> like<00:03:18.320> he<00:03:18.440> could<00:03:18.560> have

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
bad for you clear like he could have

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.289 
bad for you clear like he could have
done<00:03:18.799> the<00:03:18.890> red<00:03:19.070> ball<00:03:19.220> and<00:03:19.910> then<00:03:20.000> he<00:03:20.090> could<00:03:20.209> have

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
done the red ball and then he could have

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:21.880 
done the red ball and then he could have

wolves and then probably like blue or
grop<00:03:23.660> and<00:03:23.900> then<00:03:23.989> he<00:03:24.079> would<00:03:24.200> be<00:03:24.290> done<00:03:24.440> with<00:03:24.560> this

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650

here you can just flash over this wall
and<00:03:43.519> like<00:03:43.730> be<00:03:43.850> safe<00:03:44.060> under<00:03:44.239> the<00:03:44.359> turret<00:03:44.600> so

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
and like be safe under the turret so

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.810 
and like be safe under the turret so
he's<00:03:45.019> much<00:03:45.290> safer<00:03:45.709> here<00:03:45.920> being<00:03:46.310> cheese<00:03:46.549> and

he's much safer here being cheese and

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.940 
he's much safer here being cheese and
this<00:03:47.780> will<00:03:47.900> put<00:03:48.019> the<00:03:48.109> middle<00:03:48.350> incredibly

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
this will put the middle incredibly

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.610 
this will put the middle incredibly
behind<00:03:49.310> because<00:03:49.870> she<00:03:50.870> won't<00:03:51.019> have<00:03:51.170> any<00:03:51.320> jungle
