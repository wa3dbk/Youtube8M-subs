we've<00:00:04.890> been<00:00:04.980> working<00:00:05.250> on<00:00:05.310> our<00:00:05.339> 69<00:00:05.879> Firebird

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
we've been working on our 69 Firebird

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.600 
we've been working on our 69 Firebird
project<00:00:06.870> project<00:00:07.350> rowdy<00:00:07.770> and<00:00:08.099> we<00:00:08.309> showed<00:00:08.519> you

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
project project rowdy and we showed you

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:09.830 
project project rowdy and we showed you
what<00:00:08.730> it<00:00:08.820> looked<00:00:08.970> like<00:00:09.059> when<00:00:09.480> it<00:00:09.510> came<00:00:09.719> back

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
what it looked like when it came back

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.440 
what it looked like when it came back
from<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:10.139> media<00:00:10.410> blaster<00:00:10.860> that<00:00:11.639> was<00:00:12.150> mostly

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
from the media blaster that was mostly

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.480 
from the media blaster that was mostly
the<00:00:12.630> body<00:00:12.840> that<00:00:13.110> we<00:00:13.230> showed<00:00:13.469> you<00:00:13.679> since<00:00:14.250> then

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
the body that we showed you since then

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.099 
the body that we showed you since then
we've<00:00:14.639> had<00:00:14.670> a<00:00:14.820> lot<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.210> piece<00:00:15.420> parts<00:00:15.839> and

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
we've had a lot of the piece parts and

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.710 
we've had a lot of the piece parts and
the<00:00:16.470> subframe<00:00:16.859> media<00:00:17.400> blasted<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.359> subframe

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
the subframe media blasted the subframe

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.960 
the subframe media blasted the subframe
was<00:00:18.960> pretty<00:00:19.170> nice<00:00:19.350> it<00:00:19.770> was<00:00:20.010> square<00:00:20.580> and

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
was pretty nice it was square and

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.730 
was pretty nice it was square and
straight<00:00:21.570> it<00:00:21.869> didn't<00:00:22.170> look<00:00:22.230> like<00:00:22.289> it<00:00:22.410> gotten

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
straight it didn't look like it gotten

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.529 
straight it didn't look like it gotten
any<00:00:22.830> racks<00:00:23.160> but<00:00:23.970> there<00:00:24.090> was<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.240> few<00:00:24.420> things

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
any racks but there was a few things

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.140 
any racks but there was a few things
that<00:00:24.779> we<00:00:24.869> wanted<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.199> fix<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:26.220> couple<00:00:27.000> of<00:00:27.060> the

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
that we wanted to fix a couple of the

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.269 
that we wanted to fix a couple of the
body<00:00:27.359> mounts<00:00:27.750> were<00:00:27.869> rusty<00:00:28.320> so<00:00:28.650> we<00:00:28.949> cut<00:00:29.130> the

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
body mounts were rusty so we cut the

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.030 
body mounts were rusty so we cut the
holes<00:00:29.460> out<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:29.970> welded<00:00:30.840> in<00:00:30.960> new<00:00:31.080> holes<00:00:31.349> does

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
holes out and welded in new holes does

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.310 
holes out and welded in new holes does
that<00:00:32.160> make<00:00:32.309> sense<00:00:32.340> well<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.940> new<00:00:33.090> holes<00:00:33.320> well

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
that make sense well the new holes well

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.870 
that make sense well the new holes well
then<00:00:34.469> it's<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.680> new<00:00:34.800> body<00:00:35.010> mount<00:00:35.280> bushing<00:00:35.700> holes

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
then it's a new body mount bushing holes

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.030 
then it's a new body mount bushing holes
I<00:00:36.059> guess<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.719> then<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.230> couple<00:00:37.440> things<00:00:37.739> here

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
I guess and then a couple things here

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.950 
I guess and then a couple things here
this<00:00:38.370> front<00:00:39.120> piece<00:00:40.250> we<00:00:41.250> added<00:00:41.670> because<00:00:42.000> this

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
this front piece we added because this

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.529 
this front piece we added because this
was<00:00:43.140> crushed<00:00:43.440> underneath<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:45.090> didn't<00:00:45.329> we

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
was crushed underneath and I didn't we

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:46.639 
was crushed underneath and I didn't we
didn't<00:00:45.719> want<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.870> take<00:00:46.050> this<00:00:46.170> whole<00:00:46.410> thing

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
didn't want to take this whole thing

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.310 
didn't want to take this whole thing
apart<00:00:46.950> so<00:00:47.430> this<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:47.940> piece<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.420> one<00:00:49.079> by<00:00:49.260> two

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
apart so this is a piece of one by two

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.760 
apart so this is a piece of one by two
steel<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.370> we<00:00:51.120> cut<00:00:51.329> in<00:00:51.360> half<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:52.050> then

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
steel that we cut in half and then

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.510 
steel that we cut in half and then
formed<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.570> know<00:00:54.690> welded<00:00:55.079> in<00:00:55.170> here<00:00:55.520> to

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
formed and you know welded in here to

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.729 
formed and you know welded in here to
clean<00:00:57.360> this<00:00:57.510> up<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.840> little<00:00:57.930> bit<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.440> then<00:00:58.620> this

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
clean this up a little bit and then this

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.240 
clean this up a little bit and then this
is<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:58.949> jack<00:00:59.609> plate<00:00:59.960> from<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.020> factory<00:01:01.620> this

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
is a jack plate from the factory this

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.119 
is a jack plate from the factory this
car<00:01:03.000> had<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:04.199> know<00:01:04.229> obviously<00:01:04.559> it's<00:01:04.979> got

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
car had a you know obviously it's got

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.219 
car had a you know obviously it's got
its<00:01:05.280> subframe<00:01:05.700> crossmember<00:01:06.450> right<00:01:06.600> here<00:01:06.810> but

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
its subframe crossmember right here but

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.690 
its subframe crossmember right here but
this<00:01:07.380> was<00:01:07.560> all<00:01:07.710> pushed<00:01:08.130> in<00:01:08.310> underneath

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
this was all pushed in underneath

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.730 
this was all pushed in underneath
because<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.510> don't<00:01:10.200> know<00:01:10.260> if<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.470> had<00:01:10.560> gotten

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
because I don't know if it had gotten

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.520 
because I don't know if it had gotten
jacked<00:01:11.369> or<00:01:11.670> crushed<00:01:12.030> or<00:01:12.299> something<00:01:12.720> there<00:01:13.439> was

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
also a bunch of little holes that were

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.350 
also a bunch of little holes that were
revealed<00:01:15.390> in<00:01:15.689> things<00:01:15.960> like<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.290> core<00:01:16.470> support

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
revealed in things like the core support

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.730 
revealed in things like the core support
again<00:01:18.360> one<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.020> body<00:01:19.200> mounts<00:01:19.560> in<00:01:19.650> the

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
again one of the the body mounts in the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.530 
again one of the the body mounts in the
front<00:01:19.979> had<00:01:20.070> rusted<00:01:20.400> away<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.939> there<00:01:21.270> was<00:01:21.299> some

other<00:01:21.600> little<00:01:21.869> thin<00:01:22.140> spots<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:23.250> we<00:01:23.280> took<00:01:23.549> some

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
other little thin spots so we took some

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.670 
other little thin spots so we took some
time<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:24.090> cut<00:01:24.270> cut<00:01:24.810> those<00:01:24.990> pieces<00:01:25.200> out<00:01:25.500> and

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
time to cut cut those pieces out and

00:01:25.680 --> 00:02:04.200 
time to cut cut those pieces out and
weld<00:01:25.830> them<00:01:25.950> up<00:01:26.130> with<00:01:26.670> new<00:01:26.820> steel

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.960 

we<00:02:04.480> spent<00:02:04.720> a<00:02:04.750> little<00:02:04.870> bit<00:02:04.990> of<00:02:05.080> time<00:02:05.320> on<00:02:05.970> the

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
we spent a little bit of time on the

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.590 
we spent a little bit of time on the
body<00:02:07.210> also<00:02:07.800> doing<00:02:08.800> some<00:02:09.100> of<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.280> repairs<00:02:09.700> we

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
body also doing some of the repairs we

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.600 
body also doing some of the repairs we
found<00:02:10.840> some<00:02:11.110> holes<00:02:11.380> in<00:02:11.800> the<00:02:11.950> wheel<00:02:12.100> houses

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
found some holes in the wheel houses

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.700 
found some holes in the wheel houses
that<00:02:12.790> needed<00:02:13.060> to<00:02:13.090> be<00:02:13.180> repaired<00:02:13.660> at<00:02:14.320> the<00:02:14.440> ends

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
that needed to be repaired at the ends

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.860 
that needed to be repaired at the ends
of<00:02:14.770> the<00:02:14.860> rocker<00:02:15.070> panels<00:02:15.550> had<00:02:16.240> some<00:02:16.450> rust<00:02:16.660> in

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
of the rocker panels had some rust in

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.110 
of the rocker panels had some rust in
them<00:02:17.020> so<00:02:17.200> we<00:02:17.320> cut<00:02:17.500> that<00:02:17.620> stuff<00:02:17.890> out<00:02:18.130> and<00:02:18.310> welded

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
them so we cut that stuff out and welded

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.720 
them so we cut that stuff out and welded
some<00:02:19.270> new<00:02:19.450> steel<00:02:19.690> in<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.950> driver's<00:02:21.340> side<00:02:21.460> cowl

collected<00:02:25.120> water<00:02:25.360> over<00:02:25.600> the<00:02:25.690> years<00:02:25.900> and<00:02:26.230> rust

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
collected water over the years and rust

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:27.930 
collected water over the years and rust
it<00:02:26.830> a<00:02:26.860> little<00:02:27.040> bit<00:02:27.190> and<00:02:27.430> it<00:02:27.490> also<00:02:27.610> looked<00:02:27.880> like

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
it a little bit and it also looked like

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.550 
it a little bit and it also looked like
it<00:02:28.120> wasn't<00:02:28.480> pinched<00:02:28.960> together<00:02:29.260> very<00:02:29.500> well

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
it wasn't pinched together very well

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.090 
it wasn't pinched together very well
from<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:29.980> factory<00:02:30.400> so<00:02:30.490> we<00:02:30.910> corrected<00:02:31.660> that

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
from the factory so we corrected that

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.260 
from the factory so we corrected that
and<00:02:33.100> then<00:02:33.250> this<00:02:33.400> car<00:02:33.640> is<00:02:33.790> going<00:02:34.000> to<00:02:34.120> get<00:02:34.240> a

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
and then this car is going to get a

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.660 
and then this car is going to get a
vintage<00:02:34.630> air<00:02:34.900> air<00:02:35.650> conditioning<00:02:36.250> system

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
vintage air air conditioning system

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.320 
vintage air air conditioning system
installed<00:02:37.060> so<00:02:37.990> we<00:02:38.560> took<00:02:38.740> the<00:02:38.890> liberty<00:02:39.040> to<00:02:39.330> weld

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
installed so we took the liberty to weld

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.360 
installed so we took the liberty to weld
up<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.780> hole<00:02:41.410> where<00:02:41.709> the<00:02:41.770> factory<00:02:42.190> air<00:02:42.340> box

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
up the hole where the factory air box

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.030 
up the hole where the factory air box
was<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.959> vintage<00:02:44.080> air<00:02:44.380> kit<00:02:44.590> comes<00:02:44.800> with<00:02:44.890> a

was the vintage air kit comes with a
block<00:02:45.220> off<00:02:45.459> plate<00:02:45.640> but<00:02:46.090> we<00:02:46.600> like<00:02:46.780> to<00:02:46.810> just<00:02:47.650> weld

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
block off plate but we like to just weld

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.440 
block off plate but we like to just weld
those<00:02:48.100> Sal<00:02:48.340> and<00:02:48.550> then<00:02:48.700> drill<00:02:48.910> our<00:02:49.030> own<00:02:49.150> holes

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
those Sal and then drill our own holes

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.050 
those Sal and then drill our own holes
in<00:02:49.720> those<00:02:49.959> later<00:02:50.230> on<00:02:50.550> and<00:02:51.550> makes<00:02:51.790> it<00:02:51.880> nice<00:02:52.000> and

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
clean then we took a few minutes to

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.730 
clean then we took a few minutes to
create<00:02:54.610> a<00:02:54.820> new<00:02:55.300> package<00:02:55.570> tray<00:02:56.110> because

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
create a new package tray because

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.920 
create a new package tray because
somebody<00:02:57.190> had<00:02:57.340> cut<00:02:57.550> this<00:02:57.700> one<00:02:57.910> out<00:02:57.970> maybe<00:02:58.720> for

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
somebody had cut this one out maybe for

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.720 
somebody had cut this one out maybe for

previously and the repair was

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.540

structurally<00:03:26.500> fine<00:03:26.739> you<00:03:27.100> know<00:03:27.190> it<00:03:27.430> wasn't

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
structurally fine you know it wasn't

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.750

going<00:03:27.790> to<00:03:27.850> fall<00:03:28.030> out<00:03:28.060> or<00:03:28.420> anything<00:03:28.570> but<00:03:28.780> it<00:03:29.760> it

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
going to fall out or anything but it it

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.460

required a little bit more filler and a

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.590 
required a little bit more filler and a
little<00:03:32.709> you<00:03:33.550> know<00:03:33.640> the<00:03:33.760> fit<00:03:33.970> wasn't<00:03:34.330> quite<00:03:34.480> as

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
little you know the fit wasn't quite as

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.180 
little you know the fit wasn't quite as
nice<00:03:34.780> as<00:03:34.959> what<00:03:35.080> we<00:03:35.170> wanted<00:03:35.530> so<00:03:35.769> we<00:03:35.920> trimmed

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
nice as what we wanted so we trimmed

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.880 
nice as what we wanted so we trimmed
that<00:03:36.340> out<00:03:36.489> and<00:03:37.050> welded<00:03:38.050> in<00:03:38.140> a<00:03:38.200> new<00:03:38.320> piece<00:03:38.590> there

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
that out and welded in a new piece there

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.740 
that out and welded in a new piece there
to<00:03:39.100> make<00:03:39.280> it<00:03:39.400> a<00:03:39.459> nice<00:03:39.610> flush<00:03:40.180> you<00:03:40.660> know

to make it a nice flush you know
seamless<00:03:41.230> but<00:03:41.560> weld<00:03:41.830> style<00:03:42.459> repair<00:03:42.910> so<00:03:43.570> that's

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
seamless but weld style repair so that's

00:03:43.989 --> 00:04:32.140 
seamless but weld style repair so that's
all<00:03:44.200> dialed<00:03:44.530> in

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
painting out parts the subframe got

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:41.140 
painting out parts the subframe got
treated<00:04:37.220> to<00:04:37.460> some<00:04:37.490> Eastwood<00:04:39.250> epoxy<00:04:40.250> high

if you sandblast these things and then
paint<00:05:50.539> them<00:05:50.750> and<00:05:50.960> then<00:05:51.169> have<00:05:51.410> the<00:05:51.530> bushings

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:51.919

where<00:06:01.039> the<00:06:01.099> bushings<00:06:01.490> are<00:06:01.669> first<00:06:02.090> and<00:06:02.450> then<00:06:02.960> we

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.050 
where the bushings are first and then we

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.080

had them pressed in and now we can

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.930 
had them pressed in and now we can
easily<00:06:05.300> mask<00:06:05.780> that<00:06:06.169> and<00:06:06.500> give<00:06:07.490> everything<00:06:07.760> a
