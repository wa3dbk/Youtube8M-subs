00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello everyone I'm 21 and in this video I'll talk about the best 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.099
 games for nintendo ds in my opinion 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.099
 I can say that I can not name all of them so they do not get offended if their 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:14.180
 Favorite games are not named 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.119
 since I will name those that in my opinion could not miss 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.310
 but feel free to mention yours in comments 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:23.839
 the first game to name airs 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:25.409
 the world in cuitzeo 

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:30.029
 this game is from the genre rpg the story is about miku a boy who 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.299
 is not very sociable which appears awakening from the ground without remembering anything 

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:39.129
 Suddenly there are some sounds that are called the mount of this game 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:43.949
 in that I got in touch with txiki who asks him to make a pact to be able to fight 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:47.270
 against them and so the story begins to develop 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.710
 the sountrack of this game is the most I would say that one of the best 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.980
 in terms of graphics it is based on a 2p style with a very good drawing and 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.510
 effects well used for the game 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.820
 the one that inflates and is very good you will always be in constant movement since 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.980
 the battles unfold in doubles 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.070
 so on the main screen you'll see if that which can be 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.940
 handled with the cross or the action buttons 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.150
 while in the attack they will be in cu being handled is that with the pencil of 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.980
 the ds 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.740
 the story is the best with many laps drama and emotional moments without 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.510
 leave aside the funny 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.710
