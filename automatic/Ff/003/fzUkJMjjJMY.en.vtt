this is your traditional gravel vac has
a<00:00:38.430> check<00:00:38.820> valve<00:00:39.000> inside<00:00:39.890> you<00:00:40.890> want<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.160> make

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
a check valve inside you want to make

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.580 
a check valve inside you want to make
sure<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.090> get<00:00:42.570> your<00:00:42.629> end<00:00:42.960> in<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.260> bucket

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
sure that you get your end in the bucket

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.279 
sure that you get your end in the bucket
or<00:00:43.739> you'll<00:00:43.860> have<00:00:44.010> water<00:00:44.309> all<00:00:44.579> over<00:00:44.610> your<00:00:45.030> floor

or you'll have water all over your floor
we<00:00:46.289> want<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:47.210> shake<00:00:48.210> eat<00:00:48.450> gravel<00:00:48.870> back<00:00:49.079> up<00:00:49.289> and

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
we want to shake eat gravel back up and

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.700 
we want to shake eat gravel back up and
down<00:00:49.500> till<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.460> get<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.789> good<00:00:51.239> 12<00:00:51.539> water<00:00:51.899> such

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
down till you get a good 12 water such

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.840 
down till you get a good 12 water such
at<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.420> like<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.570> clamp<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.930> end<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.670> you<00:00:56.670> take

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
at I like to clamp the end and you take

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.479 
at I like to clamp the end and you take
your<00:00:57.000> gravels<00:00:57.360> back<00:00:57.570> in<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:58.250> put<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.340> down

your gravels back in you put it down

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.849 
your gravels back in you put it down
into<00:00:59.820> the<00:01:00.000> gravel<00:01:00.300> so<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.079> can<00:01:01.320> get<00:01:01.469> all<00:01:01.680> these

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
into the gravel so you can get all these

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.009 
into the gravel so you can get all these
particles<00:01:02.460> as<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:03.059> can<00:01:03.180> tell<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.539> particles

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
particles as you can tell the particles

particles as you can tell the particles
are<00:01:04.080> floating<00:01:04.439> on<00:01:04.530> through<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.860> gravel<00:01:05.100> back

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
are floating on through the gravel back

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.179 
are floating on through the gravel back
at<00:01:05.640> this<00:01:05.760> time<00:01:06.030> once<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.170> two<00:01:07.409> cleans<00:01:07.860> itself

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
at this time once the two cleans itself

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
we move on we do this for about thirty

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.789 
we move on we do this for about thirty
