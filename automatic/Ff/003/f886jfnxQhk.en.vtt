00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.220
heat just little oil

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.300
whenever you use oil for filling, make sure use little oil

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.560

cook it till meat's water gets dry on medium flame

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:07.280
your filling is ready, you can see it's a fine fatless mince and cook very fast

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.800
strain all oil with the help of strainer and leave aside to get normal temprature

here i will tell you, being an Asian we like little spicy.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.380
you can add little green chillies if you want to

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.080

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.640
chop it first then we will add mince into it

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:46.280

mix the mince with bulgur wheat very well

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:26.240
if you think it too soft and you can't handle it , cover it with a cling film and put in the fridge for 10 to 15 minutes

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:37.500
apply some water on your hand because mince won't stick on you hand

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.680
make a small size of ball

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:49.880

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:56.580
and give a shape as a bowl

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.400
so we can fill it

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:10.160

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:21.120

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.520
defrost it and fry it

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:44.340
press down the filling seal it and make it as a ball

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.020
