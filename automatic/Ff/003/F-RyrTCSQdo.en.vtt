00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.599
 so what we do is we get them 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.969
 learn the basics of contemporary but 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.799
 I also make sure to teach 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.990
 lower secondary school students when 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.820
 the basics of hip hop and mainly 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.020
 of breakdance and of course we started 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.279
 by heating the joints 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.900
 because it's the most important in 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.400
 the hip hop the joints is great 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.380
 important so we started with 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.520
 warming up and warmed up the 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.840
 fingers 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.370
 at first we started with spas 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.810
 basic then I'll have after a 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.890
 transition to go to the ground which they 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.570
 will be able to serve again in the dance 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.310
 contemporary in their race and a 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.860
 super ample movement that is 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:48.210
 mainly based on slipping 1 2 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:48.210
 3 4 3 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.789
 well 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.370
 see 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.489
 how 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.489
 but 

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:13.380
 if that kind m 8 and have no 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.340
 and 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.240
 then I complicate a little bit the 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.580
 movement in general we have reactions 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.659
 we'll never be able to do it 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.430
 not possible it is not possible 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.100
 and in the end the students realize 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.340
 that it's downright feasible and that at 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.710
 final they really managed to do 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.619
 I repeat my name I make a movement 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.789
 it's the other movement I hold him 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.410
 I think I have to retain 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.410
 movements of other elliott 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.910
 m 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.380
 Yes 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
 and 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.340
 ah ah 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.380
 Yes
