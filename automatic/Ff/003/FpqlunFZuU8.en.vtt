they can offer to the organization and

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:55.740 
they can offer to the organization and
we<00:00:54.010> make<00:00:54.159> our<00:00:54.280> decisions<00:00:54.670> based<00:00:54.729> on<00:00:55.000> that<00:00:55.059> the

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
we make our decisions based on that the

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.299 
we make our decisions based on that the
interview<00:00:56.109> is<00:00:56.289> probably<00:00:56.680> the<00:00:56.859> majority<00:00:57.280> of

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
interview is probably the majority of

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:59.009 
interview is probably the majority of
their<00:00:57.489> score<00:00:57.820> it<00:00:58.299> will<00:00:58.449> carry<00:00:58.689> the<00:00:58.839> most

00:00:59.009 --> 00:00:59.019 
their score it will carry the most

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:01.799 
their score it will carry the most
weight<00:00:59.170> so<00:00:59.799> our<00:01:00.399> interviews<00:01:01.000> are<00:01:01.390> very

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
weight so our interviews are very

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.259 
weight so our interviews are very
important<00:01:02.379> our<00:01:02.859> process<00:01:03.519> is<00:01:03.699> because<00:01:04.000> we<00:01:04.149> are

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
important our process is because we are

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.179 
important our process is because we are
so<00:01:04.479> involved<00:01:04.689> in<00:01:04.869> the<00:01:04.989> community<00:01:05.019> it's<00:01:05.920> much

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:06.189 
so involved in the community it's much

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:07.649 
so involved in the community it's much
more<00:01:06.399> important<00:01:06.759> for<00:01:06.850> her<00:01:06.939> to<00:01:06.970> be<00:01:07.090> well-spoken

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
more important for her to be well-spoken

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.169 
more important for her to be well-spoken
and<00:01:07.990> articulate<00:01:08.530> than<00:01:09.069> it<00:01:09.220> is<00:01:09.340> to<00:01:09.549> be<00:01:09.670> a<00:01:09.700> dancer

00:01:10.169 --> 00:01:10.179 
and articulate than it is to be a dancer

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:11.669 
and articulate than it is to be a dancer
because<00:01:10.630> we<00:01:10.869> can<00:01:11.020> practice<00:01:11.229> through<00:01:11.590> the

00:01:11.669 --> 00:01:11.679 
because we can practice through the

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:14.219 
because we can practice through the
dance<00:01:11.860> process<00:01:12.340> probably<00:01:13.149> the<00:01:13.600> main<00:01:13.840> reason

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
dance process probably the main reason

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.830 
dance process probably the main reason
that<00:01:14.259> I<00:01:14.380> came<00:01:14.649> back<00:01:14.860> is<00:01:15.159> because<00:01:15.459> I<00:01:16.119> have<00:01:16.659> such
