playing for the fun of it now I still
want<00:00:14.400> an<00:00:14.519> amplifier<00:00:15.030> that<00:00:15.240> can<00:00:15.420> kick<00:00:15.660> some

the lead channel set and you go through
the<00:05:19.560> texture<00:05:20.099> in<00:05:20.340> a<00:05:20.520> presence<00:05:21.000> button<00:05:21.360> you<00:05:21.449> can

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:21.599 
the texture in a presence button you can

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:23.779 
the texture in a presence button you can
fine-tune<00:05:21.870> all<00:05:22.349> and<00:05:22.560> even<00:05:22.710> more<00:05:23.099> and<00:05:23.669> all

that's<00:05:24.090> really<00:05:24.419> hard<00:05:24.659> to<00:05:24.810> depict<00:05:24.990> on<00:05:25.409> a<00:05:25.440> video

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
that's really hard to depict on a video

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.439 
that's really hard to depict on a video
like<00:05:26.069> this<00:05:26.099> so<00:05:26.849> you're<00:05:26.970> gonna<00:05:27.060> have<00:05:27.180> to<00:05:27.270> get

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:27.449 
like this so you're gonna have to get

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:32.680 
like this so you're gonna have to get
one<00:05:27.599> yourself<00:05:28.020> and<00:05:28.229> try<00:05:28.440> it
