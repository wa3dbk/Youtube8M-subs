here's a quick look at my bluetooth just
simple<00:03:58.400> motorola<00:03:58.760> if<00:03:58.970> I<00:03:59.120> that's<00:03:59.420> the<00:03:59.690> dial

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
simple motorola if I that's the dial

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.500 
simple motorola if I that's the dial
button<00:04:00.500> if<00:04:00.890> i<00:04:01.070> push<00:04:01.310> that<00:04:01.519> button<00:04:01.730> it<00:04:02.060> turns<00:04:02.330> on

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
button if i push that button it turns on

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.940 
button if i push that button it turns on
it's<00:04:02.930> the<00:04:03.080> same<00:04:03.230> as<00:04:03.290> pushing<00:04:03.560> this<00:04:03.739> voice

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
it's the same as pushing this voice

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.259 
it's the same as pushing this voice
command<00:04:04.280> button<00:04:04.340> and<00:04:04.760> i<00:04:04.940> think<00:04:05.180> it

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
command button and i think it

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:09.310 
command button and i think it
automatically<00:04:06.220> sets<00:04:07.220> that<00:04:07.430> as<00:04:07.640> the<00:04:08.320> voice

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
automatically sets that as the voice

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.930 
automatically sets that as the voice
command<00:04:09.530> button<00:04:09.680> i'm<00:04:10.370> not<00:04:10.549> sure<00:04:10.610> yet<00:04:10.880> i

if you're interested so let's keep going
that's<00:04:17.450> pretty<00:04:17.720> neat<00:04:17.900> so<00:04:18.049> far<00:04:18.260> right<00:04:18.410> you<00:04:18.709> can

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
that's pretty neat so far right you can

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:26.750 
that's pretty neat so far right you can
control<00:04:19.310> music<00:04:21.400> closed

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:38.900 

minimize<00:04:30.260> closed<00:04:31.260> program<00:04:37.250> well<00:04:38.250> I<00:04:38.520> guess

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
minimize closed program well I guess

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.540 
minimize closed program well I guess
that<00:04:39.090> doesn't<00:04:39.240> work<00:04:39.450> also<00:04:39.810> on<00:04:40.170> another<00:04:40.560> of<00:04:40.920> you

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550

command<00:05:14.790> which<00:05:15.030> is<00:05:15.180> I<00:05:15.420> think<00:05:15.720> we<00:05:16.020> need<00:05:16.460> set

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
command which is I think we need set

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:24.560 
command which is I think we need set
ring<00:05:17.700> or<00:05:17.850> vibrate<00:05:22.400> and<00:05:23.400> it's<00:05:23.820> on<00:05:23.970> vibrate<00:05:24.120> but

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:24.570

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
it doesn't show it but it is on vibrate
