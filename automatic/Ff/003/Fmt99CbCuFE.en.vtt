the<00:02:41.030> pancetta<00:02:41.450> more<00:02:41.810> than<00:02:41.990> just<00:02:42.260> cutting<00:02:42.590> it

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.170 
the pancetta more than just cutting it
I'm<00:02:43.130> gonna<00:02:43.310> put<00:02:43.490> it<00:02:43.610> into<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:43.910> food<00:02:44.120> processor

so you just cut it you know to
medium<00:02:47.560> dice<00:02:47.800> so<00:02:48.250> that<00:02:48.400> it<00:02:48.550> can<00:02:48.730> move<00:02:49.450> around

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
medium dice so that it can move around

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.170 
medium dice so that it can move around
freely<00:02:50.230> in<00:02:50.560> your<00:02:50.590> food<00:02:50.890> processor<00:02:50.920> and<00:02:51.790> it's
