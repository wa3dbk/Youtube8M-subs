00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.369

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.289
 good a tutorial of today more that will be 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.960
 exactly an explanatory video 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.600
 we'll discuss the theme of the game 10 30 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.029
 Okay, a good few days have passed since 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.470
 the time of the launch that was on the 9th and 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.719
 19 of 2014 and some doubts still 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.870
 appear on the heads of users or 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.989
 friends who accompanied the channel and of course 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.010
 many questions and superstitions are going 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.440
 say so speculations are there 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:49.620
 disclosed and said every day 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.379
 well some of them are that they really have 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.649
 a pet coming up and you're going to be able to 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.530
 Play this game in the region is already other 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.899
 that the following is what in the case 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.539
 now a niche is developing a 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.270
 method so that this game can be 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.729
 played or so he has the cap that 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.900
 O good guys let's start cutting 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.530
 bad for the root 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.990
 in fact this game is only supported 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.530
 online is then you will only get 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.000
 play this game if you have a connection 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.979
 online 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.900
 if you do not have a live connection 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.110
 You will not be able to play this game. 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.810
 because the game completely he 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.100
 simply it runs online does not exist 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.130
 offline campaign 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.259
 This game is the same schedule of games and 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.600
 some previous titles that come 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.880
 appearing there recently with greater 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.780
 frequency that in the case is the planting 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.540
 versus omb 7 so missing right between 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.149
 other titles and now the destiny and between 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.130
 others that only really works with 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.740
 online support 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.710
 You tell me good, then what do you have? 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.920
 cap that appears synopsis that to you 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.829
 press the y here will also appear the 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.810
 screenshots with the not particularly 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:10.229
 I know that answer is right because 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.200
 it's not for me that kind of content 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.860
 but it really is 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:19.040
 the rdh does not support this , ok even if 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.650
 you ask some questions there is 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.760
 Let's go basic and so of gameplay 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:27.950
 that something if you run your game 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.890
 he will simply say that you 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:34.489
 need a hard drive in case you 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:37.130
 will need an internal hd so that 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.660
 You can continue this game, that's right. 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.000
 I'll show you here too. 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:45.830
 some truth I 'll put the HD here 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.230
 built here in my game as prontinho 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.150
 seen there on top I just put the hd 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.849
 here on my console or 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.670
 initialize the game again to 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.829
 you even avoid even lowering the 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.950
 game sometimes by mistake understood 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:03.530
 thinking that the game is compatible or not 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.170
 with the rg the cat approving for you that 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.780
 the game is not compatible with the network aga and 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.380
 you will also have another impasse is 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.019
 right 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.840
 augusto initialize this title in your 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:17.690
 rh even converting it being 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.959
 converted into goat is right straight into the 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:24.470
 iso you turn the game into a game 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:27.019
 in beta it's alright what you can 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.930
 to do that, then quit version 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:32.780
 beta is simple just put up the most 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.480
 recent then I'll put it back here 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.889
 here for freestyle I forgot to 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.709
 put a network cable 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:41.420
 I'm going to put the network cable here 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.400
 console ready 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.850
 I came back here to fry and I just 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.040
 put a network cable in the game already 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:53.810
 appeared and skin below will initialize 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:55.930
 there the game all right here and fulfilled in 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.200
 game 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:02.840
 start the game there and you 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:09.250
 download latest act look there it's here 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:09.250
 the most recent downloading here of u 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:32.780
 had not already downloaded to u 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:37.850
 and so will validate our game as 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:44.510
 being a really 360 game valid I 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:46.910
 oa push here it will not perform 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.530
 will appear the option of one here in 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.630
 low is right 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.110
 You can tighten the air but chose your 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.790
 profile and will not be able to play 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:58.190
 choose any profile even if you 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:01.220
 will you speak the following you need 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:04.550
 Connect if xbox live to play 10 has 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:07.430
 Okay, there's no way you can play. 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.410
 destiny by linc anp is not like you 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.419
 play 10 and offline 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:14.690
 There's only one way you can play this game. 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:17.300
 night only connect from xbox live 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.960
 if your console does not have access to xbox 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.120
 live 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:24.470
 You can not play that title. 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:27.380
 good beauty know that this is not too 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:30.710
 A big one as I would tell you is a 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:33.620
 big obstacle is right because the game 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.540
 has no offline mode 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.690
 If only the game had a way 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:41.570
 offline and there was some campaign 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:44.390
 something so off line really 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:47.510
 It would exist for the possibility of being 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:49.340
 created some pet something that power 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.820
 that we could say like that dribble 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.820
 that 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:55.250
 But that does not exist, so take it. 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:57.500
 very carefully at where you click ok 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:00.260
 You can see that I'm down here. 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.330
 running destiny here on my rg a cat 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:05.030
 appearing landfill 3 appear on the media and 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:07.580
 to appear in the title below 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:10.430
 I'm going back there for freestyle so watch it 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:13.220
 just take great care where you click 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:16.880
 which is with this type of information that 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:20.000
 there is no destiny to see 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:22.940
 roll and do not turn right do not be 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.890
 cheated on anyone who does not download the game in vain 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.080
 stay my tip for you 

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:29.870
 several days have passed yes yes 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:33.080
 some rumors there that the game could yes 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:36.050
 be executed by rh from a few 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:39.500
 pet is alright but this would be downloaded 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.220
 again several contents you would have 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.620
 what remains 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:45.140
 there on the console but until the recording of this 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:47.330
 video nothing came as well 

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:49.520
 they came out without smartasses there 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.830
 I'm actually sending mail or 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.720
 watch putting click here for forum 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:57.230
 that you never entered sometimes are until 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:59.150
 creating a new forum and speaking click 

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:01.850
 here guys here is the next you 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:05.030
 click you will play 10 ine with linen 

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:07.340
 your rh where the person clicks the link and 

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:09.620
 automatically end up infecting the whole 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.900
 your computer virus beauty 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:14.030
 Good crowd, my tip is right. 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:18.170
 for you to be very careful and for 

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:21.800
 while descending on rh is impossible right 

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:24.440
 Good thing I want to also remember that this 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.720
 hence it is impossible rgh since he does not 

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:28.940
 so long as he can not access 

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:31.400
 live is alright if you are 

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:33.830
 using any medium therein in its rh 

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:37.520
 for him to access there and you will be banned 

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:39.650
 It's okay with your rg h because rh was not 

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:42.560
 designed and developed to be able to 

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:43.460
 access live safely then if you 

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.620
 be out there 

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:48.710
 know so that you will be banned because 

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:49.730
 rgh does not stay on live for long 

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:52.220
 Time is right 

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:53.810
 Good crowd, my tip is there, I'll go. 

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.669
 staying here I want to wish that 

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:56.390
 big strong hug to everyone and even the 

00:07:55.669 --> 00:07:58.990
 next 

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:58.990
 thanks
