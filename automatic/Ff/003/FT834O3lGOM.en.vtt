as<00:00:39.100> we<00:00:39.340> accelerate<00:00:39.879> with<00:00:40.030> a<00:00:40.059> high<00:00:40.300> engine

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660 
as we accelerate with a high engine

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.080 
as we accelerate with a high engine
torque<00:00:40.870> here<00:00:41.170> steady<00:00:42.040> roll<00:00:42.340> performance<00:00:42.910> is

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 
torque here steady roll performance is

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.180 
torque here steady roll performance is
very<00:00:43.120> important<00:00:43.989> cornering<00:00:44.680> and<00:00:44.800> tire<00:00:45.040> grip

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
very important cornering and tire grip

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.430 
very important cornering and tire grip
is<00:00:45.430> excellent<00:00:45.969> especially<00:00:46.600> in<00:00:46.989> such<00:00:47.170> wet

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440

is excellent especially in such wet
conditions<00:00:48.510> now

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
conditions now

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.930 
conditions now
while<00:00:50.170> braking<00:00:50.710> it's<00:00:50.920> important<00:00:51.579> of<00:00:51.670> the<00:00:51.760> rear

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
while braking it's important of the rear

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.119 
while braking it's important of the rear
axle<00:00:52.329> remains<00:00:52.629> stable<00:00:52.870> the<00:00:53.559> brake<00:00:53.739> pedal

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:56.369 
axle remains stable the brake pedal
feels<00:00:54.309> neat<00:00:54.610> and<00:00:54.820> firm<00:00:55.059> the<00:00:55.690> servo<00:00:56.050> system

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
feels neat and firm the servo system

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:58.500 
feels neat and firm the servo system
hasn't<00:00:56.649> engaged<00:00:56.829> yet<00:00:57.280> only<00:00:57.670> now<00:00:57.879> it<00:00:58.300> very

hasn't engaged yet only now it very

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.660 
hasn't engaged yet only now it very
smoothly<00:00:58.809> it<00:00:59.170> releases<00:00:59.739> the<00:01:00.040> engine<00:01:00.489> torque

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
smoothly it releases the engine torque

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:18.029 
smoothly it releases the engine torque
rather<00:01:01.149> nicely<00:01:15.450> on<00:01:16.450> this<00:01:17.080> rocky<00:01:17.350> stretch<00:01:17.710> we

00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:18.039 
rather nicely on this rocky stretch we

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:21.120 
rather nicely on this rocky stretch we
test<00:01:18.399> our<00:01:18.670> four<00:01:18.970> ETS<00:01:19.509> traction<00:01:19.990> system<00:01:20.200> this

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
test our four ETS traction system this

test our four ETS traction system this
road<00:01:21.399> is<00:01:21.580> especially<00:01:21.700> suitable<00:01:22.450> because<00:01:23.229> of

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
road is especially suitable because of

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:55.190 
road is especially suitable because of
the<00:01:23.530> strong<00:01:23.920> portions<00:01:24.460> here

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.780 

we've<00:01:56.200> taken<00:01:56.410> some<00:01:56.710> test<00:01:56.950> corners<00:01:57.310> with<00:01:57.490> sharp

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
we've taken some test corners with sharp

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.790 
we've taken some test corners with sharp
turns<00:01:58.090> and<00:01:58.480> we<00:01:58.570> only<00:01:58.720> have<00:01:58.930> minor<00:01:59.200> tire<00:01:59.530> wear

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
turns and we only have minor tire wear

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.160 
turns and we only have minor tire wear
we<00:02:00.040> can<00:02:00.190> still<00:02:00.460> use<00:02:00.640> this<00:02:00.820> one<00:02:01.090> you<00:02:01.870> can<00:02:02.020> see

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
we can still use this one you can see

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.930 
we can still use this one you can see
how<00:02:02.320> the<00:02:02.380> engine<00:02:02.740> management<00:02:03.010> system<00:02:03.550> can

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
how the engine management system can

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.700 
how the engine management system can
give<00:02:04.120> you<00:02:04.210> a<00:02:04.240> very<00:02:04.450> high<00:02:04.690> torque<00:02:04.990> that<00:02:05.500> gives

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
give you a very high torque that gives

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.850 
give you a very high torque that gives
the<00:02:05.830> vehicle<00:02:05.950> wonderfully<00:02:06.580> steady
