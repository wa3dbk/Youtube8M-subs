something<00:04:59.260> cool<00:04:59.560> little<00:04:59.920> competitive<00:05:00.400> side

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
something cool little competitive side

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.460 
something cool little competitive side
because<00:05:01.090> as<00:05:01.240> drummers<00:05:02.080> we<00:05:02.260> have<00:05:02.440> a

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
because as drummers we have a

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.470 
because as drummers we have a
competitive<00:05:03.070> side<00:05:03.340> but<00:05:03.970> like<00:05:04.090> drumming

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:04.480 
competitive side but like drumming

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.020 
competitive side but like drumming
itself<00:05:04.900> can't<00:05:05.170> be<00:05:05.290> competitive<00:05:05.730> besides<00:05:06.730> like

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
itself can't be competitive besides like

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.940 
itself can't be competitive besides like
the<00:05:07.060> Guitar<00:05:07.900> Center<00:05:07.930> Drum<00:05:08.380> Off<00:05:08.500> and<00:05:08.560> stuff

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
the Guitar Center Drum Off and stuff

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.360 
the Guitar Center Drum Off and stuff
like<00:05:09.100> that<00:05:09.310> but<00:05:09.490> that's<00:05:09.580> still<00:05:09.880> very

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
like that but that's still very

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.240 
like that but that's still very
opinionated<00:05:12.370> and<00:05:12.940> not<00:05:13.300> a<00:05:13.920> statistical<00:05:14.920> and<00:05:15.130> so

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
opinionated and not a statistical and so

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.010 
opinionated and not a statistical and so
that's<00:05:15.460> what<00:05:15.640> this<00:05:15.760> is<00:05:15.820> it's<00:05:16.240> a<00:05:16.330> statistical

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
that's what this is it's a statistical

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:22.530 
that's what this is it's a statistical
measurement<00:05:17.560> of<00:05:18.210> actually<00:05:19.210> being<00:05:20.610> like<00:05:21.610> the

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:22.540 
measurement of actually being like the

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.660 
measurement of actually being like the
best<00:05:22.750> or<00:05:23.020> the<00:05:23.050> fastest<00:05:23.620> I<00:05:23.740> guess<00:05:23.980> is<00:05:24.190> the<00:05:24.400> is

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:24.670 
best or the fastest I guess is the is

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.840 
best or the fastest I guess is the is
the<00:05:24.880> way<00:05:25.420> to<00:05:25.480> say<00:05:25.720> that<00:05:25.930> so<00:05:26.310> like<00:05:27.310> I<00:05:27.430> said<00:05:27.640> Tom
