their Lego called Magazine as I said

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.550 
their Lego called Magazine as I said
which<00:03:23.820> contained<00:03:24.239> a<00:03:24.360> spread<00:03:24.810> of<00:03:25.019> info<00:03:25.410> about

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
which contained a spread of info about

which contained a spread of info about
Bionicle<00:03:26.160> 2015<00:03:26.519> but<00:03:27.420> unfortunately<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:28.980> guys

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
Bionicle 2015 but unfortunately the guys

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.620 
Bionicle 2015 but unfortunately the guys
picture<00:03:29.850> quality's<00:03:30.480> not<00:03:30.860> exactly<00:03:32.239> the<00:03:33.239> best

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
picture quality's not exactly the best

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.420 
picture quality's not exactly the best
I've<00:03:33.989> seen<00:03:34.019> so<00:03:34.680> it's<00:03:34.860> hard<00:03:35.130> to<00:03:35.310> read<00:03:35.820> the<00:03:35.900> stuff

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
I've seen so it's hard to read the stuff

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.340 
I've seen so it's hard to read the stuff
but<00:03:38.430> I<00:03:38.459> don't<00:03:38.700> think<00:03:39.060> there's<00:03:39.390> much<00:03:39.720> new<00:03:40.110> in

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
but I don't think there's much new in

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.180 
but I don't think there's much new in
the<00:03:40.500> way<00:03:40.620> of<00:03:40.829> information<00:03:42.890> there's<00:03:43.890> a<00:03:43.950> lot<00:03:44.100> of

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
the way of information there's a lot of

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.990 
the way of information there's a lot of
concept<00:03:44.730> art<00:03:44.989> so<00:03:45.989> that's<00:03:46.170> cool<00:03:46.549> but<00:03:47.549> it<00:03:47.760> seems

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
concept art so that's cool but it seems

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.300 
concept art so that's cool but it seems
like<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.299> actual<00:03:48.630> story<00:03:48.959> blurb<00:03:49.350> is<00:03:49.650> just<00:03:50.250> a

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
like the actual story blurb is just a

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.650 
like the actual story blurb is just a
paraphrased<00:03:50.850> version<00:03:51.030> of<00:03:51.420> what<00:03:51.540> we've

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
paraphrased version of what we've

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.560 
paraphrased version of what we've
already<00:03:51.870> seen<00:03:52.670> the<00:03:53.670> mask<00:03:53.910> of<00:03:54.060> ultimate<00:03:54.420> power

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
already seen the mask of ultimate power

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.430 
already seen the mask of ultimate power
or<00:03:55.140> a<00:03:55.200> mask<00:03:55.820> similar<00:03:56.820> to<00:03:57.180> it<00:03:57.329> though<00:03:57.540> we<00:03:58.290> can

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
or a mask similar to it though we can

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.720 
or a mask similar to it though we can
see<00:03:58.560> that<00:03:58.709> pretty<00:03:58.980> clearly<00:03:59.430> it's

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
see that pretty clearly it's

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.849 
see that pretty clearly it's
intentionally<00:04:00.450> obscured<00:04:01.049> it's<00:04:01.260> not<00:04:01.440> obscured

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
intentionally obscured it's not obscured

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:04.940 
intentionally obscured it's not obscured
by<00:04:02.010> the<00:04:02.040> photography<00:04:03.560> so<00:04:04.560> what<00:04:04.709> do<00:04:04.769> you<00:04:04.829> make

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
by the photography so what do you make

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.300 
by the photography so what do you make
of<00:04:05.010> this<00:04:05.160> mask<00:04:05.400> Gilder<00:04:06.799> it<00:04:07.799> looks<00:04:07.980> kind<00:04:08.250> of

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
of this mask Gilder it looks kind of

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.400 
of this mask Gilder it looks kind of
unusual<00:04:08.549> it<00:04:09.090> reminds<00:04:09.390> me<00:04:09.600> highly<00:04:10.109> of<00:04:10.260> the

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
unusual it reminds me highly of the

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.360 
unusual it reminds me highly of the
witchdoctor<00:04:10.590> masked<00:04:11.280> hero<00:04:11.820> factory<00:04:12.030> excite<00:04:12.900> I

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
witchdoctor masked hero factory excite I

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.520 
witchdoctor masked hero factory excite I
probably<00:04:14.370> should<00:04:14.609> have<00:04:14.820> said<00:04:15.000> that<00:04:15.380> but<00:04:16.380> it

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
probably should have said that but it

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.529 
probably should have said that but it
doesn't<00:04:16.680> look<00:04:16.950> a<00:04:17.070> whole<00:04:17.400> lot<00:04:17.430> like<00:04:18.030> the<00:04:18.299> mask

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
doesn't look a whole lot like the mask

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:20.300 
doesn't look a whole lot like the mask
from<00:04:18.810> the<00:04:18.900> animation<00:04:19.590> it<00:04:19.769> doesn't<00:04:20.010> have<00:04:20.159> those

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
from the animation it doesn't have those

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.029 
from the animation it doesn't have those
six<00:04:20.940> prongs<00:04:21.419> there's<00:04:22.229> three<00:04:22.470> on<00:04:22.560> each<00:04:22.680> side

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
six prongs there's three on each side

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:25.879 
six prongs there's three on each side
yeah<00:04:24.080> but<00:04:25.080> all

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
yeah but all

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:27.980 
yeah but all
looks<00:04:26.280> like<00:04:26.490> there's<00:04:26.699> connection<00:04:27.300> points<00:04:27.749> so

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
looks like there's connection points so

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.140 
looks like there's connection points so
you<00:04:28.050> can<00:04:28.289> add<00:04:28.650> those<00:04:29.009> prongs<00:04:29.370> where<00:04:29.969> do<00:04:30.060> you

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
you can add those prongs where do you

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.260 
you can add those prongs where do you
see<00:04:30.270> this<00:04:31.400> it's<00:04:32.400> on<00:04:32.580> the<00:04:32.610> lower<00:04:33.120> right<00:04:33.509> and

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
see this it's on the lower right and

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.420 
see this it's on the lower right and
yeah<00:04:36.270> no<00:04:36.659> giving<00:04:37.560> it<00:04:37.650> a<00:04:37.740> closer<00:04:37.979> look<00:04:38.279> it

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
yeah no giving it a closer look it

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.080 
yeah no giving it a closer look it
doesn't<00:04:38.699> really<00:04:38.849> anymore<00:04:40.189> that's<00:04:41.189> a<00:04:41.310> shame<00:04:41.610> at

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
doesn't really anymore that's a shame at

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.700 
doesn't really anymore that's a shame at
first<00:04:42.360> glance<00:04:42.599> I<00:04:42.840> thought<00:04:43.050> I<00:04:43.080> saw<00:04:43.379> them<00:04:43.560> oh

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
first glance I thought I saw them oh

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.420 
first glance I thought I saw them oh
well<00:04:44.749> but<00:04:45.749> yeah<00:04:46.199> it<00:04:46.349> doesn't<00:04:46.529> look<00:04:46.800> too<00:04:47.129> highly

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
well but yeah it doesn't look too highly

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.339 
well but yeah it doesn't look too highly
like<00:04:47.669> I<00:04:47.849> mean<00:04:48.029> you<00:04:48.539> could<00:04:48.719> kind<00:04:48.960> of<00:04:49.050> see<00:04:49.229> it

00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:49.349 
like I mean you could kind of see it

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:51.140 
like I mean you could kind of see it
because<00:04:49.529> it<00:04:49.650> does<00:04:49.800> have<00:04:49.830> like<00:04:50.129> six<00:04:50.520> ridges

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
because it does have like six ridges

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.899 
because it does have like six ridges
yeah<00:04:52.080> they're<00:04:52.979> just<00:04:53.159> small<00:04:53.400> heads<00:04:53.729> it's

00:04:53.899 --> 00:04:53.909 
yeah they're just small heads it's

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:58.070 
yeah they're just small heads it's
general<00:04:54.389> shape<00:04:55.249> but<00:04:56.509> it<00:04:57.509> may<00:04:57.629> be<00:04:57.659> just<00:04:57.810> a

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
general shape but it may be just a

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.140 
general shape but it may be just a
preliminary<00:04:58.590> version<00:04:59.159> on<00:04:59.490> the<00:04:59.550> mask<00:04:59.789> or<00:05:00.060> it

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
preliminary version on the mask or it

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.429 
preliminary version on the mask or it
could<00:05:00.300> be<00:05:00.389> like<00:05:00.509> the<00:05:00.659> Ignite<00:05:00.960> where<00:05:01.229> we<00:05:01.319> had

00:05:01.429 --> 00:05:01.439 
could be like the Ignite where we had

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:03.559 
could be like the Ignite where we had
multiple<00:05:01.590> different<00:05:02.129> forms<00:05:02.550> and<00:05:02.759> this<00:05:03.330> is<00:05:03.419> not

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:03.569 
multiple different forms and this is not

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:04.850 
multiple different forms and this is not
the<00:05:03.750> actual<00:05:04.110> form<00:05:04.379> we're<00:05:04.500> gonna<00:05:04.650> be<00:05:04.770> getting

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
the actual form we're gonna be getting

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.399 
the actual form we're gonna be getting
in<00:05:05.099> a<00:05:05.129> said<00:05:05.430> it's<00:05:05.610> just<00:05:05.699> an<00:05:06.029> obscured<00:05:06.990> teaser

00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:07.409 
in a said it's just an obscured teaser

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:10.969 
in a said it's just an obscured teaser
image<00:05:07.889> if<00:05:08.550> we<00:05:08.819> really<00:05:09.360> want<00:05:09.659> to<00:05:09.719> speculate<00:05:10.110> we

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 
image if we really want to speculate we

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:12.950 
image if we really want to speculate we
could<00:05:11.219> possibly<00:05:11.460> assume<00:05:12.120> that<00:05:12.270> it<00:05:12.389> does<00:05:12.689> have

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
could possibly assume that it does have

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.649 
could possibly assume that it does have
those<00:05:13.199> six<00:05:13.529> pylons<00:05:14.099> on<00:05:14.400> the<00:05:14.520> side<00:05:14.759> and<00:05:15.060> that

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:15.659 
those six pylons on the side and that

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:17.240 
those six pylons on the side and that
when<00:05:15.900> the<00:05:15.990> masts<00:05:16.199> got<00:05:16.500> blasted<00:05:16.919> to

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
when the masts got blasted to

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.909 
when the masts got blasted to
smithereens<00:05:17.569> those<00:05:18.569> six<00:05:19.020> cutouts<00:05:19.560> got

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 
smithereens those six cutouts got

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:22.040 
smithereens those six cutouts got
knocked<00:05:20.279> off<00:05:20.520> and<00:05:20.909> now<00:05:21.270> the<00:05:21.330> toe<00:05:21.599> are<00:05:21.750> going<00:05:21.960> to

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
knocked off and now the toe are going to

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.689 
knocked off and now the toe are going to
have<00:05:22.139> to<00:05:22.259> search<00:05:22.469> for<00:05:22.650> those<00:05:22.770> as<00:05:23.009> well<00:05:23.039> oh<00:05:23.430> come

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:23.699 
have to search for those as well oh come

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:27.409 
have to search for those as well oh come
on<00:05:23.939> Islands<00:05:24.900> no<00:05:25.430> they<00:05:26.430> would<00:05:26.639> totally<00:05:27.029> do<00:05:27.210> that

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:27.419 
on Islands no they would totally do that

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:29.149 
on Islands no they would totally do that
you<00:05:27.689> know<00:05:28.020> it<00:05:28.199> they<00:05:28.409> wouldn't<00:05:28.830> have<00:05:28.919> it<00:05:29.009> hate

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:29.159 
you know it they wouldn't have it hate

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.990 
you know it they wouldn't have it hate
every<00:05:29.400> minute<00:05:29.639> of<00:05:29.699> it

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
every minute of it

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.559 
every minute of it
hey<00:05:30.650> fetch<00:05:31.650> quests<00:05:32.339> and<00:05:32.550> like<00:05:32.759> a<00:05:32.789> themes<00:05:33.210> have

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:33.569 
hey fetch quests and like a themes have

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:36.709 
hey fetch quests and like a themes have
gotten<00:05:33.839> really<00:05:33.990> old<00:05:34.879> it's<00:05:35.879> good<00:05:36.089> for<00:05:36.330> one<00:05:36.479> wave

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:36.719 
gotten really old it's good for one wave

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:39.589 
gotten really old it's good for one wave
cuz<00:05:37.080> of<00:05:37.199> nostalgia<00:05:38.009> I<00:05:38.250> don't<00:05:39.089> want<00:05:39.270> it<00:05:39.360> to<00:05:39.479> be

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:39.599 
cuz of nostalgia I don't want it to be

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:43.760 
cuz of nostalgia I don't want it to be
every<00:05:39.960> way<00:05:42.080> and<00:05:43.080> like<00:05:43.379> I<00:05:43.500> don't<00:05:43.620> mind

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
every way and like I don't mind

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.790 
every way and like I don't mind
collecting<00:05:44.250> objects<00:05:45.000> but<00:05:45.419> collect<00:05:46.169> the<00:05:46.409> six

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
collecting objects but collect the six

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.439 
collecting objects but collect the six
blank<00:05:47.639> to<00:05:48.089> do<00:05:48.270> blank<00:05:48.629> is<00:05:49.050> very<00:05:49.319> cliche<00:05:50.449> that's

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:51.449 
blank to do blank is very cliche that's

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:54.459 
blank to do blank is very cliche that's
just<00:05:51.779> my<00:05:51.930> personal<00:05:52.439> take<00:05:52.949> on<00:05:53.129> the<00:05:53.250> mattock

00:05:54.459 --> 00:05:54.469 
just my personal take on the mattock

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:57.110 
just my personal take on the mattock
another<00:05:55.469> theory<00:05:55.889> is<00:05:55.919> that<00:05:56.099> it's<00:05:56.580> not<00:05:56.789> the<00:05:56.939> mask

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
another theory is that it's not the mask

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.730 
another theory is that it's not the mask
of<00:05:57.270> ultimate<00:05:57.599> power<00:05:57.719> but<00:05:57.839> rather<00:05:58.110> a<00:05:58.289> summer

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
of ultimate power but rather a summer

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.029 
of ultimate power but rather a summer
villain<00:05:59.279> mask<00:06:00.240> because<00:06:01.080> people<00:06:01.589> say<00:06:01.740> it<00:06:01.860> looks

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039 
villain mask because people say it looks

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:05.209 
villain mask because people say it looks
vaguely<00:06:02.279> skull-like<00:06:03.830> so<00:06:04.830> it<00:06:04.949> could

00:06:05.209 --> 00:06:05.219 
vaguely skull-like so it could

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:07.519 
vaguely skull-like so it could
potentially<00:06:05.819> past<00:06:06.089> on<00:06:06.599> one<00:06:06.930> of<00:06:07.020> these<00:06:07.169> skull
