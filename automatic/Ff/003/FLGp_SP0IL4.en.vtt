first of all that's not true I did for

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.400 
first of all that's not true I did for
it<00:00:27.150> as<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:27.420> like<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.750> by<00:00:27.869> William<00:00:28.199> Shakespeare

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
it as you like it by William Shakespeare

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.500 
it as you like it by William Shakespeare
last<00:00:28.859> year<00:00:29.039> but<00:00:29.189> that's<00:00:29.400> not<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.760> point<00:00:29.789> the

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
last year but that's not the point the

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.860 
last year but that's not the point the
point<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:31.080> why<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.040> hell<00:00:32.550> do<00:00:33.120> people<00:00:33.570> seem<00:00:33.840> to

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
point is why the hell do people seem to

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.500 
point is why the hell do people seem to
think<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.410> just<00:00:34.559> because<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.430> book<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:36.059> called

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
think that just because a book is called

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.979 
think that just because a book is called
a<00:00:36.809> classic<00:00:37.620> it's<00:00:38.300> automatically<00:00:39.300> something

a classic it's automatically something

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.920 
a classic it's automatically something
that<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.890> worth<00:00:41.160> reading<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.120> that's<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.690> good

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
that is worth reading and that's a good

that is worth reading and that's a good
book<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:43.500> worth<00:00:43.800> your<00:00:44.129> time<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.430> money

if you think about it books are called
classics<00:00:47.370> really<00:00:47.789> only<00:00:48.059> have<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.690> facts<00:00:48.960> in

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
common that they're pretty old or have

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.000 
common that they're pretty old or have
been<00:00:51.750> written<00:00:51.930> maybe<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.379> hundred<00:00:52.559> years<00:00:52.920> ago

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
been written maybe a hundred years ago

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.000 
been written maybe a hundred years ago
20<00:00:53.489> years<00:00:53.579> ago<00:00:53.870> that<00:00:54.870> type<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.260> thing<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:55.920> are

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
20 years ago that type of thing that are

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.369 
20 years ago that type of thing that are
just<00:00:56.190> not<00:00:56.489> contemporary<00:00:57.329> anymore<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.230> that's

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
just not contemporary anymore and that's

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.319 
just not contemporary anymore and that's
what<00:00:58.469> makes<00:00:58.739> them<00:00:58.920> classic<00:00:59.430> because<00:00:59.820> people

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
what makes them classic because people

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.180 
what makes them classic because people
still<00:01:00.870> talk<00:01:01.109> about<00:01:01.440> them<00:01:01.710> even<00:01:02.039> though

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
still talk about them even though

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.399 
still talk about them even though
they're<00:01:02.370> not<00:01:02.430> contemporary<00:01:03.420> but<00:01:04.080> that

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
they're not contemporary but that

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.590 
they're not contemporary but that
doesn't<00:01:05.010> necessarily<00:01:05.189> mean<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.390> book

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
doesn't necessarily mean that the book

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.830 
doesn't necessarily mean that the book
is<00:01:06.630> good<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.530> just<00:01:08.040> thought<00:01:08.970> provoking<00:01:09.689> it

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
is good and just thought provoking it

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.570 
is good and just thought provoking it

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
books that are called classic seem to

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.140 
books that are called classic seem to

who don't well that they read some
better<00:03:23.579> quality<00:03:24.389> literature<00:03:24.780> than<00:03:25.349> people

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
better quality literature than people

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.680 
better quality literature than people
who<00:03:25.799> don't<00:03:25.829> this<00:03:26.639> is<00:03:26.790> again<00:03:27.060> something<00:03:27.329> where

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
who don't this is again something where

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.170 
who don't this is again something where
I<00:03:27.750> think<00:03:27.989> there<00:03:28.319> needs<00:03:28.470> to<00:03:28.590> be<00:03:28.620> some<00:03:28.859> sort<00:03:29.010> of

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
I think there needs to be some sort of

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.539 
I think there needs to be some sort of
differentiating<00:03:30.180> between<00:03:31.220> classics<00:03:32.220> that

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
differentiating between classics that

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.220 
differentiating between classics that
are<00:03:32.669> also<00:03:32.849> good<00:03:33.269> in<00:03:33.510> classics<00:03:34.019> that<00:03:34.109> are

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
are also good in classics that are

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.349 
are also good in classics that are
really<00:03:34.470> shit<00:03:34.859> and<00:03:35.129> just<00:03:35.669> because<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:35.970> book<00:03:36.209> is

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
really shit and just because the book is

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:38.690 
really shit and just because the book is
a<00:03:36.419> class<00:03:36.750> that<00:03:36.959> you're<00:03:37.109> not<00:03:37.169> required<00:03:37.799> to<00:03:38.069> like
