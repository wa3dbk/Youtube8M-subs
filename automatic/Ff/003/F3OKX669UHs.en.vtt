00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.610
 on 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.529
 Red I have too 

00:00:09.529 --> 00:00:13.739
 No where nose work with this change is resistance I'm there 

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:16.739
 that was the experience 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:26.089
 Hamster wheel operation man is nonsense scoreless separating field tackert power 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.939
 is working 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.099
 and that time out there it really is still now 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:32.090
 We only make or work losses 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.100
 if McLaren from Dr 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.050
 but to pass us the time 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.570
 just not really anymore idea follows the teacher says Prof I still have it 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:42.760
 did not approve 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.510
 So many corrections every day for more I just do service 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.340
 according to regulations 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.740
 That's exactly the signal to the students only service by regulation but 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.910
 actually, all Kirsten have a need to shape and learn as I otherwise 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.010
 we would not be 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.560
 as far as we are part of the buzzer human basic property the 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.610
 Students are within 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.930
 six weeks in a position to turn 180 degrees 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.170
 I do not think so at all the problem as only the school then encountered 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.310
 that said about neater conversation Bedi yes I've registered my child there 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.590
 Look, maybe that's what 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.410
 that was what St 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.900
 traditionally under the shoes term 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.530
 a teacher from a blackboard and 30 students the ingredients are aligned 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.060
 which one imagines and the school traditional 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.560
 this does not take place this question of what we do there 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.870
 unrestricted first with 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.790
 Absolutely meaningful to be able to answer that totally relaxed when I feel 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.670
 introduce with which 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.710
 have not polished up before 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.780
 is that her 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.730
 every day a sunny day 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.730
 many things are easy in the universities 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.450
 there and will be emptied and the people who know that 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.130
 who is not hired 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.420
 and there you can still buy as much as you can and put computers into the schools 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.170
 he would have had kids evenings staff was cost money that's it 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.169
 real 

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:12.259
 So as long as the schools do not equip themselves with new viruses we should only 

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:15.259
 Train teachers who then dismiss to other states 

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:18.889
 Of course it's really hard 

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:20.269
 movement and 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.949
 one waits to create change 

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:25.409
 So far, I know in five years 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:27.639
 Numbers are male 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:31.729
 Clearly 50 thousand teachers leave suddenly Wasmeier not Arndt 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.950
 and not by the slow procedure had certain learning conditions 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.130
 certain school communication and if you can 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.459
 because it does not want to work 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.620
 then the rest is not already with age old school law could the school 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.359
 dissolve the 45-minute tact and change completely for things, no one has 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:48.950
 Made because you have to bother then they would get it 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.389
 then settled 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:54.679
 have been going for 20 years 

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:57.679
 structurally 

00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:03.109
 you have to say goodbye that this thing happens cost-neutral 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:06.109
 many colleagues are already interested and 

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:11.179
 already attend the traditional high schools are daily and try 

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:12.039
 to the parents 

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:15.189
 from to take over and implant in their system 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:16.629
 the diocese 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:20.180
 turn on a wheel and you know that when you turn a wheel 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.559
 Inspection with my job satisfaction it enormously high 

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:27.309
 and 

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:30.309
 I feel like I have no more with him 

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:32.789
 Prof on
