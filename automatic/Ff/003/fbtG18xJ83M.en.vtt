buying<00:02:11.370> white<00:02:11.730> fondant<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.390> then<00:02:13.730> applying

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
buying white fondant and then applying

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.550 
buying white fondant and then applying
the<00:02:14.880> color<00:02:15.090> yourself<00:02:15.750> I<00:02:18.320> could<00:02:19.320> have<00:02:19.410> used

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
the color yourself I could have used

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.040 
the color yourself I could have used
gloves<00:02:21.380> but<00:02:22.380> I<00:02:22.700> just<00:02:23.700> find<00:02:23.910> it's<00:02:24.090> easier<00:02:24.750> I<00:02:24.840> get

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
gloves but I just find it's easier I get

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.190 
gloves but I just find it's easier I get
a<00:02:25.080> better<00:02:25.500> push<00:02:25.860> on<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:27.150> fondant<00:02:27.390> when<00:02:28.050> I'm

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
a better push on the fondant when I'm

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.770 
a better push on the fondant when I'm
just<00:02:28.380> using<00:02:29.190> bare<00:02:29.580> hands<00:02:32.300> another<00:02:33.300> technique

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
just using bare hands another technique

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.630 
just using bare hands another technique
as<00:02:33.990> well<00:02:34.680> is<00:02:34.920> just<00:02:36.950> squeeze<00:02:37.950> it<00:02:38.130> like<00:02:38.460> you

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
as well is just squeeze it like you

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.200 
as well is just squeeze it like you
would<00:02:38.790> a<00:02:38.850> stress<00:02:39.210> ball<00:02:39.240> and<00:02:40.610> that<00:02:41.610> will<00:02:41.790> really
