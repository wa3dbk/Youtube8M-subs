00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:33.270
 enough said that surrounds me not 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:37.260
 it's an unboxing so I'll do it 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.280
 reassure the child's name 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.680
 bomb package 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.540
 born because practically a few years 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.400
 ago but a package from Germany was born a 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.440
 small stage from germany for 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.510
 too impressed to say nothing 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.629
 to old germany media this fact 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.030
 so after a while I got a little motivated 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:01:00.719
 to get hold of it and I received a receipt 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:05.220
 which is of a receipt that the ubisoft 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:07.340
 confirmation for a purchase I made of 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.810
 assassin's creed 4 black flag 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.780
 practically bought the best edition 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.820
 edition of enada from 150 euros and it is me 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.860
 arrived this little little package 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.590
 within the application will be 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:27.060
 devotion that exclusive application 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.429
 that to exclusive contents that yes 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.740

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:33.030
 now we will see what there are so many 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.130
 inside it is understood how it should be 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.200
 be a dvd but i don't think there is 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.580
 also because I ca n't hear it already 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.250
 from outside then I think there is 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.840
 just manuals and other things 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.810

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:16.700
 swords and compasses is a bit namely that 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.700

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:46.410
 knife to hide the code 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.910
