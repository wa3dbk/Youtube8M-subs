00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
have a window tin on my car line and

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.499 
have a window tin on my car line and
they<00:00:10.710> were<00:00:10.769> just<00:00:11.010> like<00:00:11.190> we're<00:00:11.969> not<00:00:12.090> banning

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
like instrument it's like this like

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.800 
like instrument it's like this like
thing<00:00:22.109> in<00:00:22.230> my<00:00:22.380> you<00:00:22.650> see<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:22.949> this<00:00:23.160> gun<00:00:23.400> thing

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
thing in my you see it this gun thing

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.929 
thing in my you see it this gun thing
yeah<00:00:25.039> yeah<00:00:26.039> what<00:00:26.310> is<00:00:26.400> this<00:00:27.500> having<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.619> railgun

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
yeah yeah what is this having a railgun

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.950 
yeah yeah what is this having a railgun
I'm<00:00:29.939> not<00:00:30.179> sure<00:00:30.359> what<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.689> do<00:00:30.810> with<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:31.109> uh<00:00:32.960> shoot

I'm not sure what to do with it uh shoot

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.920 
I'm not sure what to do with it uh shoot
some<00:00:34.230> pedestrians<00:00:34.860> car<00:00:35.329> as<00:00:36.329> this<00:00:36.600> session

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
some pedestrians car as this session

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.130 
some pedestrians car as this session
goings<00:00:37.469> it's<00:00:37.910> crazy<00:00:38.910> deathmatch<00:00:39.480> in<00:00:39.690> here<00:00:39.899> or

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
goings it's crazy deathmatch in here or

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.560 
goings it's crazy deathmatch in here or
is<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.320> pretty<00:00:40.649> calm<00:00:41.180> you're<00:00:42.180> in<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.360> pan

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
is it pretty calm you're in the pan

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:52.720 
is it pretty calm you're in the pan
spray<00:00:42.930> aren't<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:46.489> free<00:00:47.489> chocolate<00:00:47.850> cake<00:00:48.289> you

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.980 

maybe

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:54.990 
maybe

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.650 
maybe
maybe

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
maybe

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.680 
maybe
so<00:00:57.200> actually<00:00:57.980> that<00:00:58.190> is<00:00:58.310> a<00:00:58.340> hundred<00:00:59.180> percent

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
so actually that is a hundred percent

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.860 
so actually that is a hundred percent
yes<00:00:59.980> you<00:01:00.980> were<00:01:01.220> in<00:01:01.400> the<00:01:01.520> pains<00:01:01.730> breakup<00:01:02.210> and

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
yes you were in the pains breakup and

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.740 
yes you were in the pains breakup and
you<00:01:03.230> said<00:01:03.440> no<00:01:03.710> so<00:01:04.040> that<00:01:04.520> analog<00:01:04.970> that

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
you said no so that analog that

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.960 
you said no so that analog that
algorithm<00:01:06.080> means<00:01:06.650> we<00:01:06.920> change<00:01:07.190> it<00:01:07.340> up<00:01:07.460> so<00:01:07.670> it<00:01:07.820> I

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
algorithm means we change it up so it I

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.000 
algorithm means we change it up so it I
definitely<00:01:08.270> was<00:01:08.690> in<00:01:08.870> there<00:01:09.080> and<00:01:09.350> I'm<00:01:09.890> gonna

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
definitely was in there and I'm gonna

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.130 
definitely was in there and I'm gonna
trick<00:01:10.370> you<00:01:10.520> now<00:01:10.730> I'm<00:01:11.330> not<00:01:11.390> in<00:01:11.750> there<00:01:11.930> right<00:01:11.960> now

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
trick you now I'm not in there right now

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.470 
trick you now I'm not in there right now
do<00:01:12.710> you<00:01:12.770> do<00:01:13.190> you<00:01:13.310> know<00:01:13.580> what<00:01:13.760> an<00:01:13.850> algorithm<00:01:14.120> is

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:14.480 
do you do you know what an algorithm is

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.900 
do you do you know what an algorithm is
I<00:01:14.750> don't<00:01:14.960> want<00:01:15.140> to<00:01:15.230> be<00:01:15.290> a<00:01:15.320> dick<00:01:15.620> no<00:01:16.610> it<00:01:16.760> wasn't

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
I don't want to be a dick no it wasn't

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:22.690 
I don't want to be a dick no it wasn't
all<00:01:17.120> over<00:01:17.270> rhythm<00:01:19.450> like<00:01:20.450> it's<00:01:21.230> like<00:01:21.350> a<00:01:21.700> logical

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
all over rhythm like it's like a logical

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.930 
all over rhythm like it's like a logical
set<00:01:22.880> of<00:01:23.000> steps<00:01:23.270> that<00:01:23.540> lead<00:01:23.840> to<00:01:24.940> predetermined

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
set of steps that lead to predetermined

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.360 
set of steps that lead to predetermined
outcomes<00:01:26.470> and<00:01:27.470> they<00:01:27.740> can't<00:01:27.950> happen<00:01:28.130> with

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
outcomes and they can't happen with

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.890 
outcomes and they can't happen with
humans<00:01:28.670> I<00:01:31.210> mean<00:01:32.210> like<00:01:32.330> it's<00:01:32.479> a<00:01:32.540> set<00:01:32.780> of

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
humans I mean like it's a set of

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.770 
humans I mean like it's a set of
instructions<00:01:33.410> it's<00:01:34.040> like<00:01:34.330> it's<00:01:35.330> a<00:01:35.390> thing

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
instructions it's like it's a thing

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.810 
instructions it's like it's a thing
yeah<00:01:35.930> humans<00:01:36.470> have<00:01:36.650> native<00:01:37.190> instructions

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
yeah humans have native instructions

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.469 
yeah humans have native instructions
that<00:01:38.090> particularly<00:01:38.720> every<00:01:39.170> human

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
that particularly every human

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:48.160 
that particularly every human
generalizes<00:01:41.560> uses<00:01:46.270> yeah<00:01:47.270> you're<00:01:47.660> not<00:01:47.840> in<00:01:47.990> here

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
generalizes uses yeah you're not in here

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.550 
generalizes uses yeah you're not in here
anymore

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
anymore

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:57.270 
anymore

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.220 

so<00:01:57.910> when<00:01:58.060> you<00:01:58.150> come<00:01:58.330> out<00:01:58.450> of<00:01:58.510> the<00:01:58.720> paint<00:01:58.990> spray

00:01:59.220 --> 00:01:59.230 
so when you come out of the paint spray

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:05.460 
so when you come out of the paint spray
gonna<00:01:59.440> teach<00:01:59.620> me<00:01:59.800> where<00:01:59.920> the<00:01:59.980> algorithm<00:02:00.520> is<00:02:04.470> no

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
gonna teach me where the algorithm is no

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:12.450 
gonna teach me where the algorithm is no
oh<00:02:06.720> so<00:02:07.720> you<00:02:07.780> don't<00:02:08.170> know<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:12.220> looks<00:02:12.400> pretty

you're not gonna kill me are you no look
at<00:02:18.100> my<00:02:18.190> plate<00:02:20.070> should<00:02:21.070> see<00:02:21.370> it<00:02:21.490> or<00:02:22.330> not<00:02:22.740> is

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
at my plate should see it or not is

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.570 
at my plate should see it or not is
there<00:02:23.920> a<00:02:24.070> xyron<00:02:24.570> do<00:02:25.570> I<00:02:25.600> need<00:02:25.810> a<00:02:25.840> W<00:02:26.200> or<00:02:26.380> H<00:02:26.620> I'm

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
there a xyron do I need a W or H I'm

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.710 
there a xyron do I need a W or H I'm
