00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
important that you realize that a lot of

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:29.960 
important that you realize that a lot of

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
perseverance that changes in the hero so

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.980 
perseverance that changes in the hero so
the<00:01:40.710> hero<00:01:40.950> may<00:01:41.189> get<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.520> tangible<00:01:42.210> item<00:01:42.750> like<00:01:42.930> a

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.940 
the hero may get a tangible item like a
sword<00:01:43.670> but<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.880> sword<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.600> symbol<00:01:46.409> of<00:01:46.619> the

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
sword but the sword is a symbol of the

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.200 
sword but the sword is a symbol of the
heroes<00:01:47.490> will<00:01:48.180> of<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:49.530> heroes<00:01:50.210> perseverance

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
heroes will of the heroes perseverance

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.950 
heroes will of the heroes perseverance
of<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:52.439> heroes<00:01:52.890> courage<00:01:53.670> so<00:01:54.659> it's<00:01:54.780> not<00:01:54.840> that

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
of the heroes courage so it's not that

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.709 
of the heroes courage so it's not that
they<00:01:55.200> actually<00:01:55.320> want<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.860> sword<00:01:56.360> it's<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.600> the

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
they actually want a sword it's that the

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.160 
they actually want a sword it's that the
sword<00:01:58.079> symbolizes<00:01:59.119> what<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.299> hero<00:02:00.540> has<00:02:00.719> had

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
sword symbolizes what the hero has had

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.800 
sword symbolizes what the hero has had
to<00:02:01.320> go<00:02:01.350> through<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:02.490> like<00:02:02.670> in<00:02:02.880> making<00:02:03.329> a<00:02:03.450> sword

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
to go through so like in making a sword

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.230

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
these tests in order to become the

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.100 
these tests in order to become the
person<00:02:41.030> that<00:02:41.239> they<00:02:41.450> are<00:02:41.570> in<00:02:41.780> order<00:02:41.930> to

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
person that they are in order to

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.110 
person that they are in order to
transform<00:02:42.590> from<00:02:43.280> somebody<00:02:43.700> that<00:02:43.760> may<00:02:44.030> have

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
transform from somebody that may have

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.240 
transform from somebody that may have
been<00:02:44.209> selfish<00:02:44.720> to<00:02:45.650> somebody<00:02:46.010> who's<00:02:46.220> willing

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
been selfish to somebody who's willing

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.510 
been selfish to somebody who's willing
to<00:02:46.670> sacrifice<00:02:47.000> everything<00:02:47.630> and<00:02:48.200> so<00:02:48.950> what<00:02:49.400> the

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
to sacrifice everything and so what the

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.400 
to sacrifice everything and so what the
sword<00:02:49.790> becomes<00:02:50.239> then<00:02:50.600> is<00:02:50.810> a<00:02:51.280> symbol<00:02:52.280> of<00:02:53.410> what

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
sword becomes then is a symbol of what

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.330 
sword becomes then is a symbol of what
it<00:02:54.590> is<00:02:54.620> that<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.580> hero<00:02:55.880> is<00:02:56.920> becoming<00:02:57.920> and<00:02:58.190> so

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
it is that the hero is becoming and so

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.830 
it is that the hero is becoming and so
now<00:02:58.489> I'm<00:02:58.610> going<00:02:58.700> to<00:02:58.820> fast<00:02:59.330> forward<00:02:59.450> a<00:02:59.690> little

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840
