00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.370 
remains on elevated there is no flow but
shortly<00:00:24.000> we<00:00:24.330> will<00:00:24.359> see<00:00:24.689> of<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.930> magnetic

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
to flow down one side will then see that

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.150 
to flow down one side will then see that
these<00:00:41.989> vessels<00:00:42.989> will<00:00:43.230> require<00:00:43.590> topping<00:00:44.040> off

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
these vessels will require topping off

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.380 

already<00:01:00.739> you<00:01:00.950> can<00:01:00.980> see<00:01:01.160> the<00:01:01.579> negative<00:01:01.790> tension

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
already you can see the negative tension

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.500 
already you can see the negative tension
develop<00:01:03.170> on<00:01:03.950> the<00:01:04.129> salt<00:01:04.430> solution<00:01:04.670> flowing

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
develop on the salt solution flowing

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.080 
develop on the salt solution flowing
rapidly<00:01:05.750> down<00:01:06.229> one<00:01:06.500> side<00:01:06.860> and<00:01:07.729> you<00:01:07.850> can<00:01:08.060> see

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
rapidly down one side and you can see

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.000 
rapidly down one side and you can see
the<00:01:08.390> return<00:01:08.780> flow<00:01:09.110> occurring<00:01:09.470> on<00:01:09.770> the<00:01:09.890> other

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
the return flow occurring on the other

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:17.040 
the return flow occurring on the other
side<00:01:10.340> the<00:01:11.150> salt<00:01:11.479> flows<00:01:11.720> very<00:01:12.170> rapidly<00:01:12.680> down

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.130 

now<00:01:18.050> if<00:01:18.619> we<00:01:18.830> look<00:01:19.009> down<00:01:19.040> here<00:01:19.280> we<00:01:19.690> can<00:01:20.690> see<00:01:20.720> one

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
now if we look down here we can see one

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.230 
now if we look down here we can see one
vessel<00:01:21.440> is<00:01:21.770> overflowing<00:01:22.280> and<00:01:22.759> we<00:01:22.940> can<00:01:23.119> already

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
vessel is overflowing and we can already

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.399 
vessel is overflowing and we can already
see<00:01:23.659> the<00:01:23.810> water<00:01:24.250> trickling<00:01:25.250> out<00:01:26.020> and<00:01:27.020> we<00:01:27.229> need

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
see the water trickling out and we need

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.249 
see the water trickling out and we need
to<00:01:27.560> continually<00:01:28.190> top<00:01:28.550> this<00:01:28.790> up<00:01:29.030> but<00:01:29.810> the<00:01:30.020> sole

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
to continually top this up but the sole

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:35.380 
to continually top this up but the sole
solution<00:01:30.530> rapidly<00:01:31.490> arrives<00:01:34.030> and<00:01:35.030> we<00:01:35.210> can

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
solution rapidly arrives and we can

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.330 
solution rapidly arrives and we can
still<00:01:35.600> see<00:01:35.660> the<00:01:35.899> level<00:01:36.320> vanishing<00:01:36.890> the<00:01:36.920> level

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
still see the level vanishing the level

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.389 
still see the level vanishing the level
going<00:01:37.490> down<00:01:37.789> this<00:01:38.000> side<00:01:38.470> as<00:01:39.470> water<00:01:39.800> is<00:01:40.100> pulled

going down this side as water is pulled

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:44.109 
going down this side as water is pulled
from<00:01:40.850> one<00:01:40.910> vessel<00:01:41.950> to<00:01:42.950> the<00:01:42.979> other<00:01:43.220> vessel<00:01:43.670> and

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
from one vessel to the other vessel and

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.990 

here<00:01:56.320> we<00:01:56.440> see<00:01:56.620> the<00:01:56.680> salt<00:01:57.010> solution<00:01:57.220> gathering

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
here we see the salt solution gathering

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.270 
here we see the salt solution gathering
at<00:01:58.120> the<00:01:58.150> bottom<00:01:58.570> of<00:01:58.720> the<00:01:58.810> vessel<00:01:59.130> anguish<00:02:00.130> to

at the bottom of the vessel anguish to
the<00:02:00.400> water<00:02:00.670> that's<00:02:01.000> displaced

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.890 

if<00:02:24.080> we<00:02:24.290> lock<00:02:24.409> up<00:02:24.470> loose<00:02:24.879> the<00:02:25.879> top<00:02:26.090> again<00:02:26.420> we'll

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
if we lock up loose the top again we'll

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.649 
if we lock up loose the top again we'll
kill<00:02:27.140> a<00:02:27.170> little<00:02:27.440> bit<00:02:27.680> of<00:02:27.799> water<00:02:28.010> back<00:02:28.400> in<00:02:28.659> to

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:29.659 
kill a little bit of water back in to

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:31.240 
kill a little bit of water back in to
the<00:02:29.780> syringe<00:02:30.019> and<00:02:30.379> then<00:02:30.470> release<00:02:30.920> another

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
the syringe and then release another

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.050 
the syringe and then release another
pulse<00:02:31.580> of<00:02:31.819> salts<00:02:33.159> and<00:02:34.159> you<00:02:34.430> can<00:02:34.640> see<00:02:34.879> the

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
pulse of salts and you can see the

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.509 
pulse of salts and you can see the
return<00:02:35.239> flow<00:02:35.810> occurring<00:02:36.170> there<00:02:36.590> where<00:02:37.310> the

salt solution is stuck back there in

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.979 
salt solution is stuck back there in
fact<00:02:40.370> we<00:02:40.489> can<00:02:40.700> see<00:02:40.730> salt<00:02:41.209> flowing<00:02:41.540> down<00:02:41.810> this

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
fact we can see salt flowing down this

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.640 
fact we can see salt flowing down this
side<00:02:42.290> and<00:02:42.950> soft<00:02:43.340> flowing<00:02:43.640> down<00:02:43.910> this<00:02:44.090> side<00:02:44.650> but

side and soft flowing down this side but
if<00:02:45.769> you<00:02:45.920> look<00:02:46.069> carefully<00:02:46.480> you<00:02:47.480> can<00:02:47.510> actually

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
if you look carefully you can actually

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.670 
if you look carefully you can actually
see<00:02:49.090> the<00:02:50.090> fluid<00:02:50.510> being<00:02:50.780> drawn<00:02:51.079> back<00:02:51.290> up<00:02:51.500> that

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
see the fluid being drawn back up that

00:02:51.680 --> 00:03:00.010 
see the fluid being drawn back up that
side<00:02:51.980> now<00:02:52.250> if<00:02:52.400> I<00:02:52.579> topple<00:02:53.030> down<00:02:53.060> here<00:02:53.540> again

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.020 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:06.309 

we<00:03:00.500> can<00:03:00.710> see<00:03:00.890> the<00:03:01.010> rapid<00:03:01.430> flow

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319

again<00:03:25.190> we<00:03:25.670> will<00:03:25.850> leave<00:03:26.030> some<00:03:26.270> more<00:03:26.450> salt<00:03:27.310> throw

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
again we will leave some more salt throw

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.020 
again we will leave some more salt throw
a<00:03:28.340> little<00:03:28.520> salt<00:03:28.850> back<00:03:30.430> release<00:03:31.430> a<00:03:31.460> little<00:03:31.730> more

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
a little salt back release a little more

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.570 
a little salt back release a little more
salt<00:03:32.360> but<00:03:32.630> this<00:03:32.780> time<00:03:33.050> we'll<00:03:33.230> release<00:03:33.560> it<00:03:33.800> not

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
salt but this time we'll release it not

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.800 
salt but this time we'll release it not
so<00:03:34.820> fat<00:03:35.260> you<00:03:36.260> can<00:03:36.440> actually<00:03:36.770> feel<00:03:37.250> it<00:03:37.810> wasn't

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
so fat you can actually feel it wasn't

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.990 
so fat you can actually feel it wasn't
before<00:03:38.900> withdrawal<00:03:39.500> this<00:03:39.740> he<00:03:40.640> can<00:03:40.820> actually

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
before withdrawal this he can actually

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.530 
before withdrawal this he can actually
see<00:03:41.800> the<00:03:42.800> plunger<00:03:43.370> being<00:03:43.610> socked<00:03:44.060> in<00:03:44.270> by<00:03:44.300> the

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
see the plunger being socked in by the

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.530 
see the plunger being socked in by the
negative<00:03:44.870> tension<00:03:45.650> at<00:03:45.770> the<00:03:45.890> top<00:03:46.130> and<00:03:47.120> he<00:03:47.240> drags

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
negative tension at the top and he drags

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.750 
negative tension at the top and he drags
his<00:03:47.690> salt<00:03:48.020> down<00:03:50.440> and<00:03:51.440> now<00:03:52.070> he<00:03:52.130> should<00:03:52.400> assault

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
his salt down and now he should assault

00:03:52.760 --> 00:04:00.460 
his salt down and now he should assault
rising<00:03:53.240> back<00:03:53.390> up<00:03:53.450> that's<00:03:53.750> fine

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.800 

occasionally<00:04:01.470> we<00:04:01.590> get<00:04:01.769> bubbles<00:04:02.220> forming<00:04:02.819> and

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
occasionally we get bubbles forming and

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.509 
occasionally we get bubbles forming and
with<00:04:04.140> this<00:04:04.290> experiment<00:04:05.069> you<00:04:05.250> can<00:04:05.340> actually

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
with this experiment you can actually

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.300 
with this experiment you can actually
see<00:04:05.939> bubbles<00:04:06.450> flowing<00:04:06.840> down<00:04:07.260> on<00:04:07.709> me<00:04:08.010> on<00:04:08.189> the

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
see bubbles flowing down on me on the

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.240 
see bubbles flowing down on me on the
skyline<00:04:09.000> side<00:04:09.360> so<00:04:10.200> we've<00:04:10.349> got<00:04:10.530> bubbles<00:04:10.950> flown

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
skyline side so we've got bubbles flown

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:32.540 
skyline side so we've got bubbles flown
in<00:04:11.489> the<00:04:11.610> wrong<00:04:11.790> direction<00:04:31.190> very<00:04:32.190> very

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
in the wrong direction very very

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:46.150 
in the wrong direction very very
efficient<00:04:33.330> flow<00:04:33.600> system

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.220
