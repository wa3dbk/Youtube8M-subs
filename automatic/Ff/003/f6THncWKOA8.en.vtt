grin here the Prometheus initiative so
last<00:00:03.570> night<00:00:03.720> I<00:00:03.840> did<00:00:04.110> my<00:00:04.290> pyramid<00:00:05.250> magnetic<00:00:05.970> air

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
last night I did my pyramid magnetic air

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.379 
last night I did my pyramid magnetic air
trap<00:00:06.540> I<00:00:07.350> had<00:00:07.770> it<00:00:07.859> run<00:00:07.980> all<00:00:08.010> night<00:00:08.220> to<00:00:09.179> touch

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
trap I had it run all night to touch

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.390 
trap I had it run all night to touch
some<00:00:09.719> point<00:00:09.960> in<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.200> night<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.920> nozzle

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
some point in the night the nozzle

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.839 
some point in the night the nozzle
popped<00:00:11.730> off<00:00:11.969> I<00:00:12.650> was<00:00:13.650> putting<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.040> air<00:00:14.219> into

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
popped off I was putting the air into

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.939 
popped off I was putting the air into
the<00:00:15.150> air<00:00:15.330> trapping<00:00:15.690> there's<00:00:16.500> just<00:00:16.680> so<00:00:16.830> much

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
the air trapping there's just so much

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.160 
the air trapping there's just so much
pressure<00:00:17.210> just<00:00:18.210> have<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.449> rework<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.840> design

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
pressure just have to rework the design

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.779 
pressure just have to rework the design
probably<00:00:19.619> not<00:00:19.680> these<00:00:19.859> PVC<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.460> actually<00:00:20.699> get

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
probably not these PVC to actually get

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.929 
probably not these PVC to actually get
like<00:00:21.000> nice<00:00:21.900> hard<00:00:22.320> connections<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.430> are<00:00:23.730> not

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
like nice hard connections and are not

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.420 
like nice hard connections and are not
bust<00:00:24.180> off<00:00:24.390> there'll<00:00:24.660> be<00:00:24.689> no<00:00:24.900> leakage<00:00:25.070> but<00:00:26.070> it

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
bust off there'll be no leakage but it

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:34.220 
bust off there'll be no leakage but it
worked<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:29.900> so<00:00:30.900> we<00:00:31.170> have<00:00:31.759> these<00:00:32.759> two<00:00:33.230> water

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
worked and so we have these two water

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.740 
worked and so we have these two water
this<00:00:34.710> is<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.760> ormus<00:00:36.090> water<00:00:36.360> but<00:00:36.600> when<00:00:36.719> I

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
this is the ormus water but when I

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.500 
this is the ormus water but when I
collected<00:00:37.260> this<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.280> regular<00:00:38.579> distilled

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
collected this is regular distilled

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.130 
collected this is regular distilled
water<00:00:39.840> I'm<00:00:40.320> not<00:00:40.739> sure<00:00:41.129> in<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.239> image<00:00:42.660> if<00:00:42.899> you

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
water I'm not sure in the image if you

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.920 
water I'm not sure in the image if you
can<00:00:43.350> see<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:44.420> this<00:00:45.420> guy<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:45.629> definitely

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
can see it this guy is definitely

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.279 
can see it this guy is definitely
cloudier<00:00:46.710> um<00:00:46.969> well<00:00:47.969> this<00:00:48.059> is<00:00:48.210> just<00:00:48.360> nice<00:00:48.629> clear

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
cloudier um well this is just nice clear

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.060 
cloudier um well this is just nice clear
water<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.520> other<00:00:50.670> thing<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.710> when<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.860> drink

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
water the other thing is when you drink

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
on it and I've tasted it before I can't

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.550 
on it and I've tasted it before I can't
think<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.400> where<00:01:11.520> I've<00:01:11.670> tasted<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.439> does<00:01:13.439> like

balm<00:01:28.829> which<00:01:29.400> was<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.670> surprisingly<00:01:30.210> thing

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
balm which was the surprisingly thing

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.910 
balm which was the surprisingly thing
this<00:01:30.720> morning<00:01:31.140> though<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.290> took<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.530> sip<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.770> it

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
this morning though I took a sip of it

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.990 
this morning though I took a sip of it
as<00:01:31.979> like<00:01:32.130> yes<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.579> worked<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:33.210> worked<00:01:33.680> so<00:01:35.000> yeah

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
as like yes it worked it worked so yeah

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.039 
as like yes it worked it worked so yeah
I<00:01:36.360> would<00:01:37.110> confirm<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:38.689> there<00:01:39.689> is<00:01:39.840> something

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
I would confirm that there is something

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.670 
I would confirm that there is something
with<00:01:41.210> with<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.240> gathering<00:01:42.960> ormiston<00:01:43.439> water

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
with with a gathering ormiston water

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.730 
with with a gathering ormiston water
because<00:01:44.220> all<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.579> did<00:01:44.759> was<00:01:44.820> run<00:01:45.240> air<00:01:45.509> just<00:01:46.439> air

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
because all I did was run air just air

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.100 
because all I did was run air just air
through<00:01:47.460> this<00:01:47.579> water<00:01:47.850> with<00:01:48.149> magnets<00:01:48.570> on<00:01:48.720> all<00:01:49.079> I

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
through this water with magnets on all I

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.530 
through this water with magnets on all I
did<00:01:49.259> for<00:01:49.530> hours<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:51.530> less<00:01:52.729> putting<00:01:53.729> co2<00:01:54.030> and

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
did for hours and less putting co2 and

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.870 
did for hours and less putting co2 and
oxygen<00:01:54.600> water<00:01:55.229> makes<00:01:55.710> a<00:01:55.890> sweeter<00:01:56.219> which<00:01:56.610> from

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
oxygen water makes a sweeter which from

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.700 
oxygen water makes a sweeter which from
my<00:01:57.030> experience<00:01:57.540> does<00:01:57.930> not<00:01:58.170> just<00:01:58.439> means<00:01:58.590> it

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
my experience does not just means it

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.899 
my experience does not just means it
bubbly<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.700> then<00:02:00.540> publix<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.320> mean<00:02:01.469> cover

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
bubbly and then publix I mean cover

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.260 
bubbly and then publix I mean cover
or<00:02:02.030> anything<00:02:02.359> but<00:02:03.109> it<00:02:03.499> worked<00:02:03.799> so<00:02:04.340> I<00:02:04.640> have<00:02:04.969> some

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
or anything but it worked so I have some

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.309 
or anything but it worked so I have some
more<00:02:05.420> miss<00:02:05.600> water<00:02:05.840> and<00:02:06.460> hopefully<00:02:07.460> I<00:02:08.060> can<00:02:08.929> do

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
more miss water and hopefully I can do

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.860 
more miss water and hopefully I can do
something<00:02:10.099> interesting<00:02:10.729> with<00:02:11.180> with<00:02:11.450> it<00:02:11.599> and

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
something interesting with with it and

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.070 
something interesting with with it and
hopefully<00:02:12.049> it<00:02:12.410> responds<00:02:13.930> particularly<00:02:14.930> well

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
hopefully it responds particularly well

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.640 
hopefully it responds particularly well
to<00:02:15.410> magnetic<00:02:16.010> fields<00:02:17.379> so<00:02:18.379> thank<00:02:18.860> you<00:02:19.010> and<00:02:19.220> chap
