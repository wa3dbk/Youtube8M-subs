actually work better for my skin tone
but<00:02:51.020> I<00:02:51.170> do<00:02:51.230> think<00:02:51.770> that<00:02:51.950> this<00:02:52.130> is<00:02:52.190> a<00:02:52.340> phenom<00:02:52.850> if

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
but I do think that this is a phenom if

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.210 
but I do think that this is a phenom if
you<00:02:53.240> tried<00:02:53.630> the<00:02:54.350> two-faced<00:02:54.740> and<00:02:54.920> you<00:02:55.010> just

you tried the two-faced and you just

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.210 
you tried the two-faced and you just
want<00:02:55.430> your<00:02:55.580> fair<00:02:55.940> skinned<00:02:56.330> and<00:02:57.070> just<00:02:58.070> wasn't

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020 
just to deepen it up that is a great

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.190 
just to deepen it up that is a great
product<00:03:51.290> for<00:03:51.560> this<00:03:51.709> I<00:03:52.280> do<00:03:52.550> think<00:03:53.209> that<00:03:53.540> for<00:03:53.600> the

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
product for this I do think that for the

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.690 
product for this I do think that for the
people<00:03:54.500> that<00:03:54.709> had<00:03:54.860> tried<00:03:55.130> the<00:03:55.310> Too<00:03:55.489> Faced

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
people that had tried the Too Faced

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.490 
people that had tried the Too Faced
traditional<00:03:56.300> for<00:03:56.420> arms<00:03:56.630> or<00:03:56.750> the<00:03:57.290> chocolate

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
traditional for arms or the chocolate

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.199 
traditional for arms or the chocolate
one<00:03:57.830> and<00:03:58.070> it<00:03:58.370> didn't<00:03:58.610> work<00:03:58.670> for<00:03:58.850> them<00:03:59.000> because

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
one and it didn't work for them because

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:00.880 
one and it didn't work for them because
it<00:03:59.480> did<00:03:59.660> have<00:03:59.810> too<00:03:59.959> much<00:04:00.080> red<00:04:00.410> or<00:04:00.620> pink

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
it did have too much red or pink

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.770 
it did have too much red or pink
undertone<00:04:01.430> to<00:04:01.459> it<00:04:01.670> or<00:04:01.970> it<00:04:02.120> was<00:04:02.239> just<00:04:02.270> a<00:04:02.510> little

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
undertone to it or it was just a little

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.570 
undertone to it or it was just a little
bit<00:04:02.930> too<00:04:03.140> dark<00:04:03.350> because<00:04:04.070> even<00:04:04.340> though<00:04:04.430> you

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
bit too dark because even though you

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.610 
bit too dark because even though you
swatch<00:04:04.910> it<00:04:04.940> and<00:04:05.420> it<00:04:05.540> doesn't<00:04:05.840> look<00:04:06.080> immensely

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
swatch it and it doesn't look immensely

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:07.750 
swatch it and it doesn't look immensely
dark<00:04:06.830> you<00:04:06.950> can<00:04:07.070> definitely<00:04:07.280> see<00:04:07.610> the

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
dark you can definitely see the

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.460 
dark you can definitely see the
difference<00:04:07.790> in<00:04:08.209> those<00:04:08.300> two<00:04:08.600> colors<00:04:08.870> there<00:04:09.230> and

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
difference in those two colors there and

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.640 
difference in those two colors there and
see<00:04:10.190> that<00:04:10.610> if<00:04:10.940> you<00:04:11.600> were<00:04:11.720> fair-skinned<00:04:12.380> the

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
see that if you were fair-skinned the

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.199 
see that if you were fair-skinned the
one<00:04:12.800> on<00:04:13.010> the<00:04:13.160> top<00:04:13.370> would<00:04:13.610> work<00:04:13.760> a<00:04:13.910> little<00:04:14.000> bit

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
one on the top would work a little bit

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:16.270 
one on the top would work a little bit
better<00:04:14.390> for<00:04:14.750> you<00:04:14.930> so<00:04:15.110> I<00:04:15.560> think<00:04:15.709> this<00:04:16.100> is<00:04:16.250> a

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280
