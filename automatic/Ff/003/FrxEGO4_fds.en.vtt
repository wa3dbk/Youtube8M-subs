00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
which was really entertaining since it's

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.830 
which was really entertaining since it's
kind<00:02:11.879> of<00:02:12.000> like<00:02:12.120> they<00:02:12.569> have<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:12.750> top<00:02:13.080> clan<00:02:13.530> in<00:02:13.650> the

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
kind of like they have a top clan in the

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.110 
and it just says a lot for who they are
and<00:02:22.450> that's<00:02:23.349> about<00:02:23.500> all<00:02:23.650> though<00:02:24.010> and<00:02:24.280> as<00:02:24.940> you

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
and that's about all though and as you

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.670 
and that's about all though and as you
can<00:02:25.269> see<00:02:25.300> cuantos<00:02:25.810> back<00:02:26.019> at<00:02:26.170> number<00:02:26.410> two<00:02:26.560> in

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
can see cuantos back at number two in

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.820 
can see cuantos back at number two in
the<00:02:26.709> world<00:02:26.950> and<00:02:28.019> dracula<00:02:29.019> he<00:02:29.410> i<00:02:29.440> think<00:02:29.560> is

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
the world and dracula he i think is

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.089 
the world and dracula he i think is
number<00:02:30.160> two<00:02:30.370> in<00:02:30.489> the<00:02:30.519> world<00:02:30.700> as<00:02:30.879> a<00:02:30.910> player<00:02:31.180> and

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
number two in the world as a player and

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.350 
number two in the world as a player and
mohammad<00:02:33.099> obviously<00:02:33.640> everyone<00:02:34.060> knows<00:02:34.180> who

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
mohammad obviously everyone knows who

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.440 
mohammad obviously everyone knows who
they<00:02:34.510> are<00:02:34.540> Toby<00:02:35.530> really<00:02:36.099> awesome<00:02:36.250> guy<00:02:36.640> he<00:02:37.360> was

they are Toby really awesome guy he was
partly<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:38.140> reason<00:02:38.290> this<00:02:38.530> all<00:02:38.709> happened<00:02:39.129> also

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
partly the reason this all happened also

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.000 
partly the reason this all happened also
for<00:02:39.790> the<00:02:39.879> top<00:02:40.060> ten<00:02:40.299> he<00:02:41.140> helped<00:02:41.410> out<00:02:41.530> a<00:02:41.560> lot<00:02:41.650> get

for the top ten he helped out a lot get
in<00:02:42.069> the<00:02:42.160> quantum<00:02:42.610> webbing<00:02:43.090> and<00:02:43.890> let's<00:02:44.890> just

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
in the quantum webbing and let's just

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.140 
in the quantum webbing and let's just
scroll<00:02:45.250> through<00:02:45.310> this<00:02:45.489> list<00:02:45.580> just<00:02:45.940> show<00:02:46.090> you
