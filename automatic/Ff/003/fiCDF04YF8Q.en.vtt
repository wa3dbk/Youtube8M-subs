every day how do you think Gennady get
acclimated<00:00:18.630> to<00:00:19.109> facing<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.619> southpaw<00:00:20.990> you<00:00:21.990> know

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.929 
acclimated to facing a southpaw you know
we<00:00:22.230> have<00:00:22.410> we<00:00:22.650> had<00:00:22.740> great<00:00:22.920> sparring<00:00:23.250> first<00:00:23.820> of

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
we have we had great sparring first of

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.730 
we have we had great sparring first of
all<00:00:24.199> second<00:00:25.199> I<00:00:25.289> think<00:00:25.470> this<00:00:25.560> is<00:00:25.650> the

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
all second I think this is the

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.029 
all second I think this is the
motivation<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.550> having<00:00:27.449> asleep<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:28.230> slickster

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
motivation of having asleep a slickster

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.279 
motivation of having asleep a slickster
he's<00:00:29.310> not<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.490> runner<00:00:29.820> he<00:00:30.689> likes<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:30.929> sit<00:00:31.109> on<00:00:31.140> the

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
he's not a runner he likes to sit on the

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.250 
he's not a runner he likes to sit on the
ropes<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.710> he<00:00:31.830> likes<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.189> be<00:00:32.630> slick<00:00:33.630> with<00:00:33.809> with

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
ropes and he likes to be slick with with

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.880 
ropes and he likes to be slick with with
his<00:00:34.380> shoulder<00:00:34.739> so<00:00:34.770> I<00:00:35.250> think<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:36.000> right<00:00:36.239> there

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
his shoulder so I think that right there

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.069 
his shoulder so I think that right there
makes<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:38.129> easier<00:00:39.090> for<00:00:39.300> Gennady<00:00:39.600> they're<00:00:39.870> not

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
makes it easier for Gennady they're not

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.650 
makes it easier for Gennady they're not

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.090 
punches but throwing exact punches that
to<00:03:22.390> bring<00:03:22.570> you<00:03:22.660> out<00:03:22.690> of<00:03:22.900> your<00:03:22.959> shell<00:03:23.019> I<00:03:23.440> think

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
to bring you out of your shell I think

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.500 
to bring you out of your shell I think
the<00:03:24.220> third<00:03:24.459> and<00:03:24.610> fourth<00:03:24.730> one<00:03:24.970> will<00:03:25.239> get<00:03:25.480> a

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
the third and fourth one will get a

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.870 
the third and fourth one will get a
little<00:03:25.750> heated<00:03:25.870> and<00:03:26.230> I<00:03:26.920> think<00:03:26.980> in<00:03:27.250> any<00:03:27.430> lands

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
little heated and I think in any lands

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.310 
little heated and I think in any lands
are<00:03:28.000> great<00:03:28.269> shot<00:03:28.450> somewhere<00:03:28.750> between<00:03:28.930> the<00:03:29.140> 5th

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
are great shot somewhere between the 5th

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.110 
are great shot somewhere between the 5th
and<00:03:29.410> 7th<00:03:29.799> so<00:03:29.980> you<00:03:30.040> do<00:03:30.340> think<00:03:30.579> this<00:03:30.790> will<00:03:30.940> go<00:03:31.090> a

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
and 7th so you do think this will go a

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.660 
and 7th so you do think this will go a
few<00:03:31.360> rounds<00:03:31.420> at<00:03:31.780> the<00:03:31.870> very<00:03:32.049> least<00:03:32.260> oh<00:03:32.590> I<00:03:33.459> think

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
few rounds at the very least oh I think

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.970 
few rounds at the very least oh I think
Willie's<00:03:34.090> pedigree<00:03:34.540> in<00:03:34.660> Willie's<00:03:35.019> history

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
says that it will I don't think it's

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.259 
says that it will I don't think it's
going<00:03:38.980> to<00:03:39.070> stand<00:03:39.220> it<00:03:39.370> with<00:03:39.489> unity<00:03:39.880> and<00:03:40.000> gennady

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269
