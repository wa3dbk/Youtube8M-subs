00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.869 
to make a lamp using this motorcycle rim
a<00:00:09.290> light<00:00:10.100> kit<00:00:10.460> and<00:00:11.080> this<00:00:12.080> lens<00:00:12.770> I've<00:00:13.040> that<00:00:13.280> at<00:00:13.760> a

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:13.879 
a light kit and this lens I've that at a

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:16.810 
a light kit and this lens I've that at a
junk<00:00:14.180> shop<00:00:14.240> my<00:00:15.230> only<00:00:15.530> problems<00:00:16.010> i<00:00:16.250> need<00:00:16.580> to

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:16.820 
junk shop my only problems i need to

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.300 
junk shop my only problems i need to
come<00:00:17.210> up<00:00:17.240> with<00:00:17.390> way<00:00:17.690> to<00:00:17.750> hold<00:00:18.140> this<00:00:18.350> up<00:00:18.619> away

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310 
come up with way to hold this up away

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.759 
come up with way to hold this up away
from<00:00:19.340> the<00:00:19.610> light<00:00:19.880> bulb<00:00:20.320> so<00:00:21.320> i'll<00:00:21.410> have<00:00:21.529> to<00:00:21.650> come

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:21.769 
from the light bulb so i'll have to come

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:23.880 
from the light bulb so i'll have to come
up<00:00:21.830> with<00:00:21.890> a<00:00:22.010> structural<00:00:22.490> design<00:00:22.789> for<00:00:23.000> that<00:00:23.029> i

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
up with a structural design for that i

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.499 
up with a structural design for that i
have<00:00:24.890> three<00:00:25.160> different<00:00:25.369> kind<00:00:25.759> of<00:00:25.880> basis<00:00:26.210> i<00:00:26.359> can

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:26.509 
have three different kind of basis i can

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:28.599 
have three different kind of basis i can
use<00:00:26.660> for<00:00:26.869> structures<00:00:27.410> I<00:00:27.679> have<00:00:28.130> a<00:00:28.160> lamp<00:00:28.490> shade

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:28.609 
use for structures I have a lamp shade

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:30.759 
use for structures I have a lamp shade
that<00:00:29.029> I<00:00:29.150> can<00:00:29.330> cut<00:00:29.570> up<00:00:29.720> and<00:00:30.140> change<00:00:30.410> the<00:00:30.560> color

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:30.769 
that I can cut up and change the color

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:33.880 
that I can cut up and change the color
of<00:00:30.890> I've<00:00:31.820> got<00:00:32.090> a<00:00:32.119> record<00:00:32.689> Bowl<00:00:33.080> which<00:00:33.500> would<00:00:33.740> be

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
of I've got a record Bowl which would be

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.670 
of I've got a record Bowl which would be
pretty<00:00:34.100> cool<00:00:34.160> and<00:00:34.430> funky<00:00:34.640> I<00:00:35.110> got<00:00:36.110> coffee<00:00:36.350> can<00:00:36.649> I

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
pretty cool and funky I got coffee can I

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.130 
pretty cool and funky I got coffee can I
can<00:00:36.950> also<00:00:37.070> cut<00:00:37.399> down<00:00:37.430> to<00:00:37.789> the<00:00:37.879> size<00:00:38.090> I<00:00:38.300> need<00:00:38.570> now

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
can also cut down to the size I need now

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.600 
can also cut down to the size I need now
I<00:00:39.170> have<00:00:39.350> to<00:00:39.440> decide<00:00:39.530> which<00:00:39.890> one<00:00:40.100> I<00:00:40.129> want<00:00:40.399> to<00:00:40.460> use

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
I have to decide which one I want to use

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.439 
I have to decide which one I want to use
I<00:00:40.910> changed<00:00:41.629> my<00:00:41.780> mind<00:00:41.809> about<00:00:42.410> my<00:00:42.770> base<00:00:43.120> it<00:00:44.120> just

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:44.449 
I changed my mind about my base it just

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:46.229 
I changed my mind about my base it just
didn't<00:00:44.809> really<00:00:44.960> work<00:00:45.289> out<00:00:45.530> like<00:00:45.890> I<00:00:46.100> planned

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
didn't really work out like I planned

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:48.760 
didn't really work out like I planned
but<00:00:47.239> I<00:00:47.270> realized<00:00:47.660> that<00:00:47.840> all<00:00:47.960> these<00:00:48.110> reflectors

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
but I realized that all these reflectors

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.939 
but I realized that all these reflectors
so<00:00:49.550> i<00:00:49.579> am<00:00:50.000> going<00:00:50.300> to<00:00:50.449> drill<00:00:51.170> holes<00:00:51.350> in<00:00:51.620> them<00:00:51.739> and

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
so i am going to drill holes in them and

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.490 
so i am going to drill holes in them and
connect<00:00:52.820> them<00:00:52.910> with<00:00:52.969> wire<00:00:53.449> copper<00:00:54.079> wire<00:00:54.260> that

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
connect them with wire copper wire that

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.549 
connect them with wire copper wire that
i<00:00:54.559> have<00:00:54.829> around<00:00:55.430> and<00:00:55.989> that<00:00:56.989> way<00:00:57.199> the<00:00:57.350> light

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
i have around and that way the light

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:59.439 
i have around and that way the light
will<00:00:57.769> come<00:00:57.800> out<00:00:58.190> in<00:00:58.519> different<00:00:59.120> colors<00:00:59.420> and

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
will come out in different colors and

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.619 
will come out in different colors and
directions<00:01:00.160> i've<00:01:01.160> added<00:01:01.550> the<00:01:01.789> reflectors<00:01:02.359> on

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
directions i've added the reflectors on

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.930 
directions i've added the reflectors on
and<00:01:02.989> i<00:01:03.199> use<00:01:03.379> copper<00:01:03.769> wire<00:01:03.980> to<00:01:04.280> secure<00:01:04.699> it<00:01:04.820> on

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
and i use copper wire to secure it on

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.740 
and i use copper wire to secure it on
tightly<00:01:05.390> and<00:01:05.780> now<00:01:06.650> my<00:01:06.890> problem<00:01:07.190> is<00:01:07.640> i<00:01:07.940> would

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
tightly and now my problem is i would

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.660 
tightly and now my problem is i would
like<00:01:09.049> to<00:01:09.170> put<00:01:09.350> my<00:01:09.380> lens<00:01:09.799> on<00:01:10.040> but<00:01:10.280> how<00:01:10.430> am<00:01:10.610> I

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
like to put my lens on but how am I

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.880 
like to put my lens on but how am I
going<00:01:10.850> to<00:01:10.939> secure<00:01:11.450> it<00:01:11.600> so<00:01:11.840> that<00:01:12.409> it<00:01:12.530> can<00:01:12.680> come

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
going to secure it so that it can come

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.219 
going to secure it so that it can come
back<00:01:13.070> off<00:01:13.340> again<00:01:13.610> so<00:01:14.119> you<00:01:14.210> can<00:01:14.270> change<00:01:15.020> light

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
back off again so you can change light

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.499 
back off again so you can change light
bulb<00:01:15.439> when<00:01:15.619> light<00:01:15.799> goes<00:01:15.830> out<00:01:16.159> I've<00:01:16.759> also<00:01:17.119> added

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
bulb when light goes out I've also added

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.630 
bulb when light goes out I've also added
a<00:01:17.840> chain<00:01:19.659> he<00:01:20.659> holds<00:01:21.020> a<00:01:21.110> light<00:01:21.320> up<00:01:21.530> and<00:01:21.799> I<00:01:22.340> use

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
a chain he holds a light up and I use

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.109 
a chain he holds a light up and I use
two<00:01:22.970> holes<00:01:23.299> that<00:01:23.450> I<00:01:23.570> found<00:01:23.930> alongside<00:01:24.460> for<00:01:25.460> my

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
two holes that I found alongside for my

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.890 
two holes that I found alongside for my
nuts<00:01:26.600> and<00:01:26.840> bolts<00:01:26.960> and<00:01:27.229> washers<00:01:28.630> I'm<00:01:29.630> going<00:01:29.840> to

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900
