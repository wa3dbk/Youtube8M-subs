00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.090
 After all it's worth it 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:23.140
 Buch 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:33.060
 re product 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:33.060
 N Onno 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.510
 N hehehe 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.540
 1 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:46.080
 def ordinary 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.860
 It is divided roughly into four in me 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.950
 For example if there are parts that are that demand 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:55.160
 First of all , there are four things you are looking for in the line 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.760
 a First of all, with flying distance and flying anxiety 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.300
 What 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:06.159
 It looks after sensitivity 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:07.070
 Temperature to + is the stress without stress about if say one another after the durability or the influence of wind 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.270
 Or 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:15.179
 This is Toka what influence it a 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:18.960
 Now let's focus on the four main parts that you can do without feeling stress 

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:21.170
 It means that it took me a year to say my selfishness . 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.040
 But 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:29.540
 First of all, if you think about the Hikiori that I am seeking 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.420
 Both nylon line distance and I do not even do not If you think the durability I atopy line 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.110
 It will be overdue 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:38.670
 It, of course's p If you say Kanbo in 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:43.860
 It does not say in the softness no 9 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.630
 It's ok because it's ok, so it's located in the middle, so it has both performances. 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.180
 I'm a flowline and I 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.130
 It is why you feel 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:55.520
 Both have both , but there are still good and bad points 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:02:00.710
 Even though the flight distance is I need, for example, there is no logic to 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:04.770
 What also out of the line work in the time of something wind in the wind of the impact a little susceptible still the crosswind 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:08.399
 And it will do a = sensitivity would say 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:13.500
 Float easy to nothing a pretty color specific gravity is more of a still 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:15.750
 Although I'm the advantages, of course, when this time is a little do the bottom comes from the middle layer 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:21.570
 It becomes a habit 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:23.820
 I need the impression of p , but the sensitivity is too good and I need more information 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:27.860
 It is also the idea that I do not need is 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:32.390
 Since there is much pt after that, it becomes a situation 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:34.460
 This time you will need the maneuverability required of humans and rods 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:40.760
 Good feelings 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:43.330
 Above, in the case of my balance, it seems that baths are probably the easiest to use. 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.330
 It is a conclusion 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.410
 In the part of this distance and durability, this Amon 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.870
 only 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:58.410
 I think this sensitivity and is proportional to the Tteyuu this person sensitivity in this both be clear right under 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.650
 Though we do with this part 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.160
 B in my leaf 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.220
 Impressive was good 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:09.220
 A has grown a little in the province of Windou 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.460
 Feel a little dull 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:16.570
 With durability and one person 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:19.930
 If it is the same class, it should be impressed 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:22.080
 I think there is a part that is required to pro loaf 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.180
 As a mediator for me 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.810
 It's almost time 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:30.990
 I did 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:36.900
 And this was also my selfishness , but a wonderful line that no problem at all 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:38.550
 I got the conviction that after all this management tree is in this area through this floating 6 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.710
 Well that 's it 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:46.160
 Even if it's snowing, the tournament is no longer 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:47.510
 It will be held in this extremely cold of this winter 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:52.330
 What 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:56.920
 Hard thing because in Tteyuu the durability much its pro 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:04:00.040
 Selfishness of a line that is me what kind of support there but it is weak not in the cold 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.880
 It is also the most disturbing part of me 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.940
 Because 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:09.550
 That let me use one winter surgery 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.550
 I told you that I could do the test . 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:18.010
 Normally, it 's a discharge of 0.45 , so when it comes to furniture in an exchange, the wind tree game 0.45 is 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:23.480
 Although it corresponds 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:26.780
 Without any problems we test this dare 0.35 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:31.100
 It was usable, so it is something that is by this name 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.880
 If you ask for oppo , let's make the distance as thin as possible 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:37.820
 The more narrow if 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:39.160
 Spread mainland attack range at that but is to fly far so let fly far 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.580
 Isn't it 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:48.100
 It's all about becoming a strategy too 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:54.160
 However, it is a place where I was stuck with it so much That kind of problem in me at all 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:58.330
 I already asked for the first tweeter line was completely completed 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:03.550
 Of course it is from now on but this one year 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:08.230
 Tteyuu than went the other a total of this line so anymore at all people track record in the tournament 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:09.610
 Part is I think this is you can see the other guys anymore if you look at that my grades 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.710
 I will 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.270
 Hmm 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.270
 Hmm 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.270
 Hmm 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.010
 Hmm 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.010
 Have 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.830
 hoop 

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:28.670
 voodoo 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:28.670
 hal 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.360
 Hmm
