they're<00:00:26.460> using<00:00:26.820> on<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.180> frogs<00:00:27.449> back<00:00:27.779> they

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
they're using on the frogs back they

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.290 
they're using on the frogs back they
have<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.710> agitate<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.429> Frog<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.699> little<00:00:30.029> bit<00:00:30.210> in

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
have to agitate the Frog a little bit in

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.880 
have to agitate the Frog a little bit in
order<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.539> get<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.810> Frog<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.230> secrete<00:00:31.590> the

toxic<00:00:32.730> poisons<00:00:33.270> that<00:00:33.480> naturally<00:00:34.079> come<00:00:34.320> out<00:00:34.440> of

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
toxic poisons that naturally come out of

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.889 
toxic poisons that naturally come out of
their<00:00:34.710> skin<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.610> poison<00:00:36.180> would<00:00:36.360> then<00:00:36.600> be

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
their skin that poison would then be

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.110 
their skin that poison would then be
dried<00:00:37.290> on<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.920> arrow<00:00:38.100> or<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.520> dart<00:00:38.910> and

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
dried on to the arrow or the dart and

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.540 
dried on to the arrow or the dart and
they<00:00:39.450> use<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:40.079> catch<00:00:40.290> things<00:00:40.620> way<00:00:41.280> high

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
they use that to catch things way high

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.090 
they use that to catch things way high
in<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.790> canopy<00:00:42.000> where<00:00:42.660> without<00:00:43.020> these<00:00:43.469> frogs

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
in the canopy where without these frogs

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.130 
in the canopy where without these frogs
assisting<00:00:44.879> them<00:00:45.030> they'd<00:00:45.420> never<00:00:45.660> be<00:00:45.870> able<00:00:46.050> to

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
assisting them they'd never be able to

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.900 
assisting them they'd never be able to
get<00:00:46.260> their<00:00:46.440> food<00:00:46.649> it's<00:00:46.860> very<00:00:47.070> difficult<00:00:47.579> for

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
get their food it's very difficult for

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.760 
get their food it's very difficult for
anybody<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.809> lives<00:00:48.989> in<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.140> rainforest<00:00:49.289> to

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
anybody that lives in the rainforest to

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.160 
anybody that lives in the rainforest to
catch<00:00:50.039> something<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.700> trees<00:00:50.969> are<00:00:51.149> 80<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.870> 100

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
catch something the trees are 80 to 100

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.130 
catch something the trees are 80 to 100
feet<00:00:52.320> high<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.879> poison<00:00:54.300> dart<00:00:54.480> frogs<00:00:54.809> are

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
feet high so the poison dart frogs are

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.740 
feet high so the poison dart frogs are
animals<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:55.920> mankind<00:00:56.910> uses<00:00:57.329> almost<00:00:57.480> as<00:00:57.719> a

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
animals that mankind uses almost as a

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.410 
animals that mankind uses almost as a
tool<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.350> live<00:00:58.829> in<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.039> very<00:00:59.190> inhospitable<00:00:59.460> area

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.529 
tool to live in a very inhospitable area
they<00:01:00.989> get<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.440> poison<00:01:01.680> however<00:01:02.329> it's<00:01:03.329> not<00:01:03.510> a

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
they get the poison however it's not a

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.119 
they get the poison however it's not a
natural<00:01:04.170> thing<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.409> comes<00:01:04.710> out<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:04.949> their

natural thing that comes out of their
back<00:01:05.339> we<00:01:05.580> learned<00:01:05.880> over<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.600> years<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:07.409> the

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
back we learned over the years that the

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.440 
back we learned over the years that the
frogs<00:01:07.950> acquire<00:01:08.490> this<00:01:08.729> poison<00:01:09.240> through<00:01:09.390> a

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
frogs acquire this poison through a

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.710 
frogs acquire this poison through a
series<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:09.960> events<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:11.010> small<00:01:11.880> ant<00:01:12.150> would<00:01:12.510> eat

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
series of events a small ant would eat

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.020 
series of events a small ant would eat
the<00:01:12.869> root<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.500> plant<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:14.159> ant<00:01:14.729> would<00:01:14.909> get

the root of a plant that ant would get
eaten<00:01:15.180> by<00:01:15.390> another<00:01:15.420> insect<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.320> Frog

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
eaten by another insect and the Frog

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.440 
eaten by another insect and the Frog
read<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:16.979> insect<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.820> toxins<00:01:18.330> are

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
read that insect and the toxins are

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.320 
read that insect and the toxins are
passed<00:01:18.720> on<00:01:18.990> possibly<00:01:19.860> from<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.670> plant<00:01:20.970> itself

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
passed on possibly from the plant itself

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.810
