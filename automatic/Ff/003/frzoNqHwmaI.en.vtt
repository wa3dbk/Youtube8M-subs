look is very focused on the blush so I'm

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.070

point<00:06:48.410> quite<00:06:48.980> a<00:06:49.010> bit<00:06:49.250> so<00:06:49.490> it<00:06:49.610> does<00:06:49.790> look

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.000 
point quite a bit so it does look

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.270
