00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.240
 hello youtube brain dragtstra here with 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.510
 a little mini tutorial about it 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.580
 remove noise in adobe lightroom 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.570
 I have taken a picture were nice 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.090
 some noise and this photo that is 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.330
 made with very high ISO values ​​and 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.519
 therefore, that noise is caused as 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.699
 you see the photo has quite a bit of sharpness 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.289
 so your screen is not the problem 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.109
 the problem is really in the enormous 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.820
 grain that rice grain that maybe 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.410
 and that is caused by the high 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.760
 iso values 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.520
 let's see how we can do that 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.010
 and when you start taking it 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.590
 remove noise then you want to start 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.690
 with correctly setting you 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.809
 contrasts and your photo exposure 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.460
 and also of a correct color balance 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.780
 After the first works if it is in yourself 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.850
 a bit strong with my color balance 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.260
 look for god where my skin is beating 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.120
 serves in the most 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.309
 the best thing would be if I got a white here 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.320
 point in the photo pieters reference too 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.550
 but in this photo that is 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.960
 Unfortunately not 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.460
 so i'll put it a little on it here 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.770
 also have to do 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.369
 after one i think i'm pretty good here 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.350
 neighborhood is of course no 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.330
 no certainty this way but me 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.619
 come pretty close 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.890
 then i will look at my 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.689
 I want beautiful contrasts and me 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.640
 want to see what i am in the high 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.530
 Lights can do you see if you are right 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.780
 looks like I'm high on zero here 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.170
 that your lamp is actually one here 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.060
 bit what what what things break and 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.310
 through my highlights we return 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.860
 draw is particularly in that lamp 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.200
 the picture a bit nicer so I go up 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.570
 is a bit away but now I get too 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.310
 a problem here so in the dark 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.290
 parties one that dark parties that 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.840
 likes that guitar and problems 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.110
 so then I just go a little bit yes 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.270
 the dark areas with lightening 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.790
 I really want the real black one 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.280
 keep dark so I'm going to be my weak 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:03.030
 do not pull a little down 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.530
 a lot but a little and i will see what i am 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.719
 with my white tint how to the 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.280
 contain some real serious white hues 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.250
 that break 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.240
 so I also bring it back a bit and 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.300
 this way I get a photo that 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.070
 nice in terms of clarity 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.110
 so the exposure here is pretty okay 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.510
 I still have a huge one 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.610
 problem with noise and not at all the 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.480
 photo being edited will be the house 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.480
 very visible 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.940
 the way to work away at home in one 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.230
 photo is in your detail tab in adobe 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.840
 lightroom 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.580
 to look at your noise reduction and 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.620
 you can do quite a bit more if I 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.590
 me a thousand this now went on screw then 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.350
 would you see that i'm really on a green on 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.830
 a pretty solid way the noise here 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.150
 can take away but the whole picture is now 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.570
 a bit slippery 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.430
 if i now go look before and after 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.780
 Then you see that I am not just the noise 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.490
 have taken away 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.200
 here in this section for example one 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.060
 in the bark of the guitar here in this 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.000
 shirt but you also see that I have something 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.310
 lost sharpness in my strings and if 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.260
 i was farther here look i am 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.970
 sharpened lost detailing throughout 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.470
 the hand has gone into the detailing 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.970
 skin has left 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.770
 well here i still have the zipper 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.770
 which has remained very beautiful 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:23.230
 so i want the 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.520
 that the the solution of the noise 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.520
 take away 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.230
 is not applied everywhere I can 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.030
 do this again by turning on the sharpening 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.340
 If I put in particular to IBES 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.900
 just watched and I go 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.460
 sharpen 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.830
 you see it at a good time 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.660
 that sharpening but nice helps 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.610
 to get everything nice again so I have 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.190
 here in the hand for example 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.050
 I get some detail back through that 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.180
 set sharpening quite high and me 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:52.360
 and I still vary jet tank 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.250
 I can still make sure that yes 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.810
 I some more 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.960
 choose where the sharpening will be 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:01.930
 applied and with detail I know say 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:04.030
 from god i want to have a little detail 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.530
 or do I want a lot of detail as I do 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.300
 floats on this and you see one 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.680
 cubes pattern emerged 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.010
 that had to do with the sensor of the 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.800
 camera but well applied you see me 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.630
 quite a bit here can do to the 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.450
 control the details 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:22.570
 and making sure that I also focus 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.580
 to sit that hand but just like you 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.810
 now have the noise back in the 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.450
 background 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.760
 so that background here often type now 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.560
 again house which was just now I 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.750
 not wanted 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.419
 during a solution before i go 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:40.120
 look at the whole photo here we have 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:42.730
 namely the mask and the master state 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.620
 at the sharpening because the mask is 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.990
 an application that is only on the 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:50.169
 sharpening is applied if I use the 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:52.630
 press the alt key on my keyboard and 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.620
 I stand on the sharpening and I go 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.250
 with that 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:59.440
 pulling to the right then I see where it is 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.750
 sharpening is applied 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.240
 everything that is white is what it is 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.830
 sharpening is applied and you have 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.600
 I need that you see for example in the 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.130
 beard of the men in his face and 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.870
 in the guitar 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.360
 since it is sharpening will be 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.310
 applied so it becomes blurry 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.410
 I have caused expensive 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.440
 noise reduction is reduced again 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.330
 by the sharpening that I bring 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.979
 but the whole background where i correct 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.650
 well he wants thousands this whole 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:28.479
 strong that stays beautiful this way 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.280
 out of focus and there the noise becomes 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:33.220
 taken away 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:37.660
 this way I have a sharp one 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:39.220
 Party in the guitar here in the hand here 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.050
 so if you look at the zipper 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.090
 everything is sharp here 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.880
 really everywhere in horse I have everywhere 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:48.550
 to sit sharp but the background is 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.260
 has become pretty out of focus and therefore the 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.600
 Noise removed and if I take the picture then 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.700
 go compare then you see me here 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.550
 really have a huge improvement 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:06:00.010
 applied to the photo 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:02.289
 hey you look before and after image 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:04.120
 and look how beautiful that jacket 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:07.510
 has become what he got how beautiful that 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:09.729
 zipper has become here and how 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:11.800
 little noise I have in the background 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:14.169
 also in those lamps , for example, those lamps 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.789
 much better in what he is 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:18.010
 radiates 

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:19.840
 this is really a photo that i like a lot and 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:21.280
 can take a lot more 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.229
 this photo and the right side is 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.470
 publication worthy and and the left 

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:28.710
 absolutely not now I am going to the whole 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.710
 to 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:35.140
 this is how your cross is removed from one 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:38.600
 photo in a roll photo I have you one 

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:39.740
 roll photo needed in adobe lightroom 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.750
 I hope you enjoy it 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.920
 tutorial about the removal of 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:45.110
 House 

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.930
