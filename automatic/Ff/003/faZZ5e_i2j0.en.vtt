00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
green water is the Sun sunlight

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.080 
green water is the Sun sunlight
stimulates<00:01:03.450> algae<00:01:03.870> growth<00:01:04.880> dramatically<00:01:05.880> and

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
stimulates algae growth dramatically and

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.639 
stimulates algae growth dramatically and
green<00:01:06.299> water<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.840> one<00:01:07.079> of<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.320> common

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:07.649 
green water is one of the common

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:10.039 
green water is one of the common
problems<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:08.340> fact<00:01:08.549> when<00:01:08.759> when<00:01:09.090> people<00:01:09.299> call

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
problems in fact when when people call

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.870 
problems in fact when when people call
me<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.590> ask<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.370> know<00:01:11.460> what<00:01:11.610> do<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:11.729> do<00:01:11.790> about

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
me and ask you know what do I do about

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.610 
me and ask you know what do I do about
green<00:01:12.299> water<00:01:12.540> problems<00:01:13.020> one<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.440> main

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:13.620 
green water problems one of the main

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.170 
green water problems one of the main
things<00:01:13.860> I'll<00:01:14.010> talk<00:01:14.220> about<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.610> sun<00:01:14.790> exposure

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
things I'll talk about is sun exposure

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.730 
things I'll talk about is sun exposure
and<00:01:15.510> figuring<00:01:15.840> out<00:01:15.930> how<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.140> limit<00:01:16.560> that

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
and figuring out how to limit that

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.039 
and figuring out how to limit that
obviously<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:18.120> best<00:01:18.299> way<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.510> limit<00:01:18.750> sun

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
obviously the best way to limit sun

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.190 
obviously the best way to limit sun
exposure<00:01:19.440> is<00:01:19.770> through<00:01:20.280> shade<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:21.049> just<00:01:22.049> like

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
exposure is through shade and just like

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.500 
exposure is through shade and just like
you<00:01:22.350> or<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.500> would<00:01:22.799> do<00:01:23.060> we<00:01:24.060> want<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.330> try<00:01:24.450> to

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.510 
you or I would do we want to try to

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.500 
you or I would do we want to try to
block<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:25.020> Sun<00:01:25.260> as<00:01:26.250> best<00:01:26.610> we<00:01:26.670> can<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.210> can<00:01:27.360> use

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
block the Sun as best we can you can use

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.530 
block the Sun as best we can you can use
physical<00:01:27.960> structures<00:01:28.560> around<00:01:28.830> your<00:01:29.100> pond<00:01:29.540> but

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
physical structures around your pond but

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.480 
physical structures around your pond but
the<00:01:30.690> easiest<00:01:31.020> way<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.710> most<00:01:31.860> beneficial

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
the easiest way and the most beneficial

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.460 
the easiest way and the most beneficial
and<00:01:32.640> natural<00:01:33.090> way<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:33.720> through<00:01:34.080> adding

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
and natural way is through adding

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.740 
and natural way is through adding
surface<00:01:35.040> plants<00:01:35.520> floating<00:01:36.210> plants<00:01:36.570> like

surface plants floating plants like

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.230 
surface plants floating plants like
lilies<00:01:37.229> provide<00:01:37.710> tremendous<00:01:38.369> benefit<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.060> any

and beyond that they provide shade and
that<00:01:45.540> way<00:01:46.140> they<00:01:46.799> limit<00:01:47.310> or<00:01:47.520> potentially<00:01:48.180> limit

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
that way they limit or potentially limit

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.179 
that way they limit or potentially limit
the<00:01:48.630> stimulation<00:01:49.110> for<00:01:49.439> algae<00:01:49.830> the<00:01:50.040> other
