00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.819 
quickly don't have the digital
proportional<00:01:56.909> control<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:57.630> if<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:58.229> do<00:01:58.469> want

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
proportional control so if you do want

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.670 
proportional control so if you do want
to<00:01:59.070> make<00:01:59.909> a<00:01:59.969> turn<00:02:00.329> that's<00:02:00.659> not<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:00.899> tight<00:02:01.290> turn

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
to make a turn that's not a tight turn

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.380 
to make a turn that's not a tight turn
you<00:02:01.890> can<00:02:02.040> app<00:02:02.189> test<00:02:02.460> here<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.759> little<00:02:03.060> bit<00:02:03.180> let

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
you can app test here a little bit let

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.450 
you can app test here a little bit let
go<00:02:03.509> stir<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.810> little<00:02:03.990> bit<00:02:04.170> let<00:02:04.320> go<00:02:04.500> cool<00:02:05.219> thing

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
go stir a little bit let go cool thing

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.730 
go stir a little bit let go cool thing
is<00:02:05.579> that<00:02:05.610> when<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.000> hit<00:02:06.090> reverse<00:02:06.740> while

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
is that when you hit reverse while

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.830 
is that when you hit reverse while
you're<00:02:08.009> turning<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:08.580> will<00:02:08.819> do<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.390> little<00:02:09.629> bit

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
you're turning it will do a little bit

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.880 
you're turning it will do a little bit
of<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:10.140> fishtail<00:02:10.890> or<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.250> one

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
of a fishtail or a one

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.460 
of a fishtail or a one

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
spin which you saw there for a few

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.770 
spin which you saw there for a few
seconds<00:02:14.890> so<00:02:15.040> it's<00:02:15.520> just<00:02:15.670> a<00:02:15.790> cool<00:02:16.270> little<00:02:16.300> thing

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
how fast this car looks like it's going

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.770 
how fast this car looks like it's going
right<00:02:33.310> here<00:02:33.550> like<00:02:33.820> it's<00:02:34.000> you<00:02:34.540> know<00:02:34.600> it's

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
right here like it's you know it's

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.050 
right here like it's you know it's
moving<00:02:34.900> at<00:02:35.200> a<00:02:35.230> pretty<00:02:35.500> decent<00:02:35.760> decent<00:02:36.760> pace

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
moving at a pretty decent decent pace

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.290 
moving at a pretty decent decent pace
it's<00:02:37.480> it's<00:02:37.900> not<00:02:38.080> too<00:02:38.320> sluggish<00:02:38.680> that's<00:02:39.520> mostly

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
it's it's not too sluggish that's mostly

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.690 
it's it's not too sluggish that's mostly
because<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:41.050> camera<00:02:41.410> is<00:02:41.500> actually<00:02:41.680> zoomed<00:02:42.340> in

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
here I'm going to actually zoom out all

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.330 
here I'm going to actually zoom out all
the<00:02:46.720> way<00:02:46.900> and<00:02:49.080> there<00:02:50.080> now<00:02:50.680> you<00:02:50.739> can<00:02:51.160> actually

see<00:02:51.910> what<00:02:52.300> the<00:02:52.330> real<00:02:52.750> speed<00:02:53.290> of<00:02:53.500> this<00:02:53.680> is

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
see what the real speed of this is

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.280 
see what the real speed of this is
relative<00:02:54.640> to<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:54.940> rest<00:02:55.120> of<00:02:55.300> the<00:02:55.390> world<00:02:55.630> when
