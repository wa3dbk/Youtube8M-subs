00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.830 

all<00:04:24.810> right<00:04:25.080> so<00:04:25.759> you're<00:04:26.759> in<00:04:26.879> the<00:04:26.970> ship<00:04:27.240> now<00:04:27.629> and

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
all right so you're in the ship now and

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.710 
all right so you're in the ship now and
the<00:04:30.840> optional<00:04:31.199> objective<00:04:31.650> is<00:04:32.389> achieving<00:04:33.389> the

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
the optional objective is achieving the

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.339 
the optional objective is achieving the
killer<00:04:33.990> kills<00:04:34.800> three<00:04:35.370> and<00:04:35.879> what<00:04:36.720> you<00:04:36.930> want<00:04:37.289> to

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:37.349 
killer kills three and what you want to

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:40.909 
killer kills three and what you want to
do<00:04:37.470> it<00:04:37.740> is<00:04:38.780> before<00:04:39.780> well<00:04:40.199> as<00:04:40.379> you<00:04:40.590> kill<00:04:40.770> the

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
do it is before well as you kill the

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:44.809 
do it is before well as you kill the
officers<00:04:41.370> there's<00:04:41.849> going<00:04:42.000> to<00:04:42.060> be<00:04:42.120> men<00:04:42.800> so<00:04:43.819> it's

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:44.819 
officers there's going to be men so it's

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:47.869 
officers there's going to be men so it's
pretty<00:04:45.030> easy<00:04:46.069> so<00:04:47.069> I<00:04:47.099> think<00:04:47.280> it<00:04:47.550> takes<00:04:47.699> about

00:04:47.869 --> 00:04:47.879 
pretty easy so I think it takes about

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:52.790 
pretty easy so I think it takes about
three<00:04:48.389> or<00:04:48.509> four<00:04:48.750> kills<00:04:49.110> to<00:04:49.740> get<00:04:49.949> the<00:04:50.099> option<00:04:51.800> so

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
three or four kills to get the option so

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.980 
three or four kills to get the option so
just<00:04:53.219> go<00:04:53.370> for<00:04:53.400> the<00:04:53.639> officer<00:04:54.060> and<00:04:54.330> our<00:04:54.569> man<00:04:54.810> will

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
just go for the officer and our man will

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:00.439 
just go for the officer and our man will
come<00:04:55.169> towards<00:04:55.440> you<00:04:57.680> or<00:04:58.680> if<00:04:59.280> not<00:04:59.610> you'll<00:04:59.909> find

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:00.449 
come towards you or if not you'll find

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:03.350 
come towards you or if not you'll find
the<00:05:00.599> nearest<00:05:00.840> make<00:05:01.340> assassinating<00:05:02.340> at<00:05:03.240> the

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
the nearest make assassinating at the

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.740 
the nearest make assassinating at the
same<00:05:03.569> time<00:05:03.840> let's<00:05:04.289> go<00:05:04.469> from<00:05:04.620> a<00:05:04.740> chain<00:05:04.949> that

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.770
