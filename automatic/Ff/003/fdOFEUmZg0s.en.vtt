00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.000 
well guess what life takes this series -
oh<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.479> he<00:01:48.870> gets<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.260> nice<00:01:49.530> little<00:01:49.740> break

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
oh and he gets a nice little break

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.380 
oh and he gets a nice little break
before<00:01:50.310> he<00:01:50.490> goes<00:01:50.580> into<00:01:50.760> his<00:01:50.850> next<00:01:51.060> game<00:01:51.150> this

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
before he goes into his next game this

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.000 
before he goes into his next game this
is<00:01:51.570> certainly<00:01:51.960> an<00:01:52.170> interesting<00:01:52.500> take<00:01:52.890> on

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
is certainly an interesting take on

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.260 
is certainly an interesting take on
things<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.310> mean<00:01:53.400> life<00:01:53.610> certainly<00:01:53.970> had<00:01:54.150> the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
things I mean life certainly had the

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.200 
things I mean life certainly had the
opportunity<00:01:55.130> just<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.280> go<00:01:56.430> for<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.670> macro<00:01:56.970> game

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
opportunity just to go for a macro game

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.460 
opportunity just to go for a macro game
and<00:01:57.390> we<00:01:57.510> wouldn't<00:01:57.810> have<00:01:57.930> blamed<00:01:58.080> him<00:01:58.290> at<00:01:58.380> all

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
and we wouldn't have blamed him at all

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:59.840 
and we wouldn't have blamed him at all
that's<00:01:58.650> normally<00:01:59.070> what<00:01:59.190> I<00:01:59.250> would<00:01:59.430> expect<00:01:59.520> in

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
that's normally what I would expect in

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.490 
that's normally what I would expect in
this<00:01:59.970> issue<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.210> in<00:02:00.450> life<00:02:00.780> in<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.020> GSL

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
this issue and in life in the GSL

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.410 
this issue and in life in the GSL
actually<00:02:01.860> normally<00:02:02.220> does<00:02:02.430> this<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:02.850> when<00:02:03.360> he

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
actually normally does this and when he

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.719 
actually normally does this and when he
goes<00:02:03.570> for<00:02:03.780> one<00:02:03.930> game<00:02:04.110> is<00:02:04.350> super<00:02:04.799> aggressive<00:02:04.950> we

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
goes for one game is super aggressive we

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.460 
goes for one game is super aggressive we
often<00:02:06.120> see<00:02:06.270> him<00:02:06.299> fall<00:02:06.570> back<00:02:06.750> on<00:02:06.900> his<00:02:07.020> macro<00:02:07.350> in

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
often see him fall back on his macro in

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:07.720 
often see him fall back on his macro in
the

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730 
the

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.160 
the

Dreamhack<00:02:09.590> summer<00:02:09.620> it's<00:02:10.160> gonna<00:02:10.250> be<00:02:10.370> going

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
Dreamhack summer it's gonna be going

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.120 
Dreamhack summer it's gonna be going
straight<00:02:10.970> for<00:02:11.210> the<00:02:11.300> speed<00:02:11.600> very<00:02:12.320> very<00:02:12.710> early

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
straight for the speed very very early

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.120 
straight for the speed very very early
gas<00:02:13.430> as<00:02:13.700> well<00:02:13.940> and<00:02:14.600> he<00:02:14.960> is<00:02:15.080> gonna<00:02:15.200> be<00:02:15.380> expanding

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
gas as well and he is gonna be expanding

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.220 
gas as well and he is gonna be expanding
of<00:02:16.340> course<00:02:16.580> at<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.390> very<00:02:17.540> least<00:02:17.690> needs<00:02:18.050> that

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
of course at the very least needs that

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.690 
of course at the very least needs that
extra<00:02:18.470> larvik<00:02:18.920> remains<00:02:19.250> to<00:02:19.340> be<00:02:19.370> seen<00:02:19.580> whether

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
extra larvik remains to be seen whether

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.340 
extra larvik remains to be seen whether
he's<00:02:19.970> gonna<00:02:20.060> be<00:02:20.150> droning<00:02:20.570> up<00:02:20.690> with<00:02:20.870> that<00:02:21.080> or

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
he's gonna be droning up with that or

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.990 
he's gonna be droning up with that or
whether<00:02:21.560> he's<00:02:21.740> gonna<00:02:21.860> use<00:02:22.160> this<00:02:22.310> to<00:02:22.640> go<00:02:22.730> for<00:02:22.970> a

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
whether he's gonna use this to go for a

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.660 
whether he's gonna use this to go for a
massive<00:02:23.420> speedling<00:02:23.840> attack<00:02:24.110> well<00:02:24.890> he<00:02:25.370> does

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
massive speedling attack well he does

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.640 
massive speedling attack well he does
have<00:02:25.700> hope<00:02:26.480> he's<00:02:26.720> a<00:02:26.750> great<00:02:27.050> cop

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
have hope he's a great cop

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.740 
have hope he's a great cop
gas<00:02:28.070> income<00:02:28.730> okay<00:02:29.150> yeah<00:02:29.300> that's<00:02:29.570> ink<00:02:29.630> one

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
gas income okay yeah that's ink one

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:30.640 
gas income okay yeah that's ink one
thing<00:02:29.870> so<00:02:29.960> he<00:02:30.050> does<00:02:30.260> have<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:30.530> option

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
thing so he does have the option

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.380 
thing so he does have the option
Department<00:02:31.100> or<00:02:31.250> full-on<00:02:31.580> observing<00:02:32.090> that's

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
Department or full-on observing that's

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.940 
Department or full-on observing that's
right<00:02:32.570> if<00:02:32.720> he<00:02:32.870> does<00:02:33.080> that<00:02:33.290> this<00:02:33.470> natural<00:02:33.680> base

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
right if he does that this natural base

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.200 
right if he does that this natural base
could<00:02:34.160> be<00:02:34.220> in<00:02:34.310> a<00:02:34.370> lot<00:02:34.520> of<00:02:34.610> problems<00:02:34.880> we<00:02:34.970> can<00:02:35.090> see

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
could be in a lot of problems we can see

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.430 
could be in a lot of problems we can see
that<00:02:35.360> Todd<00:02:35.510> does<00:02:35.720> have<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:36.020> mothership<00:02:36.260> core

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
that Todd does have the mothership core

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.350 
that Todd does have the mothership core
coming<00:02:36.740> out<00:02:36.860> the<00:02:37.310> Overlord<00:02:37.910> is<00:02:38.060> just<00:02:38.180> getting

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
natural these zerglings alone are gonna

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:42.940 
natural these zerglings alone are gonna

coming<00:02:49.220> up<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.460> zerglings<00:02:49.820> moving<00:02:50.420> back

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
coming up the zerglings moving back

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.300 
coming up the zerglings moving back
because<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:50.930> mothership<00:02:51.170> core<00:02:51.380> is<00:02:51.590> there<00:02:51.890> but

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
because the mothership core is there but

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.580 
because the mothership core is there but
seeing<00:02:52.550> only<00:02:52.730> four<00:02:53.120> is<00:02:53.540> probably<00:02:54.050> not<00:02:54.290> enough

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
seeing only four is probably not enough

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.090 
seeing only four is probably not enough
to<00:02:55.010> trigger<00:02:55.340> Todd<00:02:55.730> simple<00:02:56.150> your<00:02:56.240> concern<00:02:56.630> I

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
to trigger Todd simple your concern I

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.520 
to trigger Todd simple your concern I
think<00:02:58.100> at<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:58.460> moment<00:02:58.580> for<00:02:59.030> links<00:02:59.530> isn't

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
think at the moment for links isn't

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.290 
think at the moment for links isn't
enough<00:03:00.740> in<00:03:00.860> him<00:03:00.950> to<00:03:01.070> go<00:03:01.220> oh<00:03:01.370> no<00:03:01.730> what's<00:03:02.060> going

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
enough in him to go oh no what's going

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.400 
enough in him to go oh no what's going
on<00:03:02.450> here<00:03:02.600> but<00:03:02.660> the<00:03:02.750> mother<00:03:02.900> of<00:03:03.050> course<00:03:03.140> called

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
on here but the mother of course called

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:04.930 
on here but the mother of course called
a<00:03:03.440> little<00:03:03.620> bit<00:03:03.710> off<00:03:03.830> guard<00:03:03.860> give<00:03:04.190> us<00:03:04.280> six<00:03:04.580> links

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
a little bit off guard give us six links

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.700 
a little bit off guard give us six links
actually<00:03:05.240> are<00:03:05.360> able<00:03:05.630> to<00:03:05.660> get<00:03:05.870> in<00:03:06.050> and<00:03:06.530> now<00:03:06.650> we

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:06.710 
actually are able to get in and now we

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.290 
actually are able to get in and now we
see<00:03:06.890> the<00:03:06.980> movie<00:03:07.160> into<00:03:07.460> the<00:03:07.550> main<00:03:07.700> basis<00:03:08.090> probe

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
see the movie into the main basis probe

and well Todd is gonna have to fend this

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.100 
and well Todd is gonna have to fend this
off<00:03:49.370> basically<00:03:49.820> with<00:03:50.150> probes<00:03:50.510> right<00:03:50.750> now<00:03:50.870> it's

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
off basically with probes right now it's

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:52.540 
off basically with probes right now it's
looking<00:03:51.470> increasingly<00:03:51.590> difficult

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
looking increasingly difficult

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.310 
looking increasingly difficult
he<00:03:52.820> has<00:03:53.060> got<00:03:53.300> foreclosed<00:03:53.600> on<00:03:53.720> an<00:03:53.840> overcharge

he has got foreclosed on an overcharge

he has got foreclosed on an overcharge
down<00:03:54.739> on<00:03:54.980> that<00:03:55.160> nexus<00:03:55.550> but<00:03:55.700> there<00:03:55.820> were<00:03:55.880> so

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
down on that nexus but there were so

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.280 
down on that nexus but there were so
many<00:03:56.180> of<00:03:56.330> these<00:03:56.390> links<00:03:56.660> it<00:03:56.720> will<00:03:56.840> take<00:03:57.020> quite<00:03:57.230> a

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
many of these links it will take quite a

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:58.450 
many of these links it will take quite a
while<00:03:57.440> for<00:03:57.980> them

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:58.460 
while for them

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.130 
while for them
altogether<00:03:58.790> this<00:03:59.240> is<00:03:59.570> proving<00:04:00.020> to<00:04:00.110> be

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
altogether this is proving to be

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.350 
altogether this is proving to be
possibly<00:04:00.680> disastrous<00:04:01.070> Pathan<00:04:01.640> if<00:04:01.970> he<00:04:02.180> holds

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
possibly disastrous Pathan if he holds

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.360 
possibly disastrous Pathan if he holds
this<00:04:02.540> up<00:04:02.750> though<00:04:02.960> who<00:04:03.290> does<00:04:03.530> have<00:04:03.770> the<00:04:03.830> natural

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
this up though who does have the natural

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.250 
this up though who does have the natural
expansion<00:04:04.640> already<00:04:05.120> up<00:04:05.330> but<00:04:05.690> the<00:04:05.810> wall<00:04:05.990> once

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
expansion already up but the wall once

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.960 
expansion already up but the wall once
again<00:04:06.650> the<00:04:07.070> Gateway<00:04:07.400> here<00:04:07.580> has<00:04:07.760> to<00:04:07.880> be

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
again the Gateway here has to be

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.790 
again the Gateway here has to be
cancelled<00:04:08.510> yeah<00:04:08.810> these<00:04:08.990> additional<00:04:09.500> gateways

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
cancelled yeah these additional gateways

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.200 
cancelled yeah these additional gateways
also<00:04:10.130> getting<00:04:10.340> taken<00:04:10.520> out<00:04:10.640> here<00:04:10.790> what<00:04:11.030> guy

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:11.210 
also getting taken out here what guy

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.390 
also getting taken out here what guy
tech<00:04:11.450> is<00:04:11.630> so<00:04:12.110> nearly<00:04:12.650> finished<00:04:13.070> and<00:04:13.250> that's

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
tech is so nearly finished and that's

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.800 
tech is so nearly finished and that's
what<00:04:13.580> Todd<00:04:13.730> really<00:04:14.060> needed<00:04:14.330> before<00:04:14.420> these

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
what Todd really needed before these

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.020 
what Todd really needed before these
gateways<00:04:15.050> fell<00:04:15.440> but<00:04:16.010> it<00:04:16.280> looks<00:04:16.550> like<00:04:16.640> he<00:04:16.940> is

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
gateways fell but it looks like he is

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.310 
gateways fell but it looks like he is
not<00:04:17.330> gonna<00:04:17.450> be<00:04:17.570> able<00:04:17.660> to<00:04:17.780> get<00:04:17.900> that<00:04:18.050> which<00:04:18.200> the

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
not gonna be able to get that which the

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:20.420 
pylon will be - powering them and now

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.420
