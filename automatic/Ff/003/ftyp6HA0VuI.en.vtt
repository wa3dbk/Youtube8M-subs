first<00:01:02.550> layer<00:01:02.789> sets<00:01:03.170> then<00:01:04.170> when<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.409> pull<00:01:04.559> it

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
first layer sets then when you pull it

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.960

out<00:01:04.769> you're<00:01:04.949> going<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.100> put<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.339> nose<00:01:05.549> on<00:01:05.790> top

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
and then coat it with your second layer

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.940 
and then coat it with your second layer
of<00:01:08.220> buttercream<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.970> also<00:01:09.869> put<00:01:10.260> some<00:01:10.290> ears<00:01:10.619> on

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
of buttercream and also put some ears on

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.620 
of buttercream and also put some ears on
the<00:01:11.159> side<00:01:11.369> which<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:11.790> just<00:01:11.970> cut<00:01:12.150> out<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.479> the

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
the side which I just cut out of the

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.580 
the side which I just cut out of the
offcuts<00:01:12.990> as<00:01:13.170> well

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
offcuts as well

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.210 
offcuts as well
this<00:01:14.070> helps<00:01:14.430> create<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.530> full<00:01:16.530> mask<00:01:16.830> effect

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
this helps create that full mask effect

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.310 
this helps create that full mask effect
when<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:18.000> put<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.299> fondant<00:01:18.659> over<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:19.020> so<00:01:19.229> it

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
when you put the fondant over it so it

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.840 
when you put the fondant over it so it
looks<00:01:19.530> like<00:01:19.590> someone's<00:01:20.159> actually<00:01:20.460> really

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
looks like someone's actually really

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.120 
looks like someone's actually really
wearing<00:01:21.210> this<00:01:21.330> type<00:01:21.659> mask<00:01:21.960> apply<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.770> second

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
wearing this type mask apply the second

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.530 
wearing this type mask apply the second
layer<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.369> buttercream<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.970> smooth<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.450> all

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
layer of buttercream and smooth it all

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.749 
layer of buttercream and smooth it all
out<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.409> doesn't<00:01:25.650> make<00:01:25.950> your<00:01:26.100> fondant<00:01:26.549> all

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
out so it doesn't make your fondant all

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.370 
out so it doesn't make your fondant all
bumpy<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.509> don't<00:01:27.689> catch<00:01:27.960> any<00:01:28.140> air

in some lines to guide me where it would

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.890 
in some lines to guide me where it would
be<00:02:42.840> and<00:02:43.290> then<00:02:43.830> used<00:02:44.130> my<00:02:44.280> little<00:02:44.900> stitching

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
marked out where the lines would be for

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.830 
marked out where the lines would be for
his<00:02:51.780> seams<00:02:53.000> using<00:02:54.000> some<00:02:54.180> dark<00:02:54.390> green<00:02:54.570> fondant

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
his seams using some dark green fondant

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.810 
his seams using some dark green fondant
I<00:02:55.050> cut<00:02:55.290> out<00:02:55.320> the<00:02:55.470> shape<00:02:55.710> of<00:02:55.740> his<00:02:55.950> eyes<00:02:56.220> and<00:02:56.550> then

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
I cut out the shape of his eyes and then

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.820 
I cut out the shape of his eyes and then
gave<00:02:57.270> it<00:02:57.390> a<00:02:57.540> little<00:02:57.660> bit<00:02:57.840> of<00:02:57.930> a<00:02:58.050> shape<00:02:58.470> with

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
gave it a little bit of a shape with

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.100 
gave it a little bit of a shape with

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.920 
where the blue marks are on the template
and<00:03:01.290> then<00:03:02.130> I<00:03:02.370> cut<00:03:02.760> out<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:03.150> red<00:03:03.360> piece<00:03:03.600> of<00:03:03.840> the

fondant<00:03:04.290> where<00:03:04.470> his<00:03:04.590> eyes<00:03:04.800> would<00:03:04.980> go<00:03:05.160> and

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
fondant where his eyes would go and

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.699

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
gently push that in and made it meet up

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.010 
gently push that in and made it meet up
with<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.070> seams<00:03:08.340> that's<00:03:09.180> very<00:03:09.450> important<00:03:09.930> to

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
with the seams that's very important to

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.020 
with the seams that's very important to
make<00:03:10.200> sure<00:03:10.230> it's<00:03:10.860> cut<00:03:11.100> exactly<00:03:11.520> the<00:03:11.850> right

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
make sure it's cut exactly the right

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.780 
make sure it's cut exactly the right
size<00:03:12.270> so<00:03:12.390> it<00:03:12.750> meets<00:03:13.020> in<00:03:13.230> sits<00:03:13.500> flush<00:03:13.770> do<00:03:14.670> the

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
size so it meets in sits flush do the

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.880 
size so it meets in sits flush do the
same<00:03:15.000> with<00:03:15.209> the<00:03:15.330> other<00:03:15.540> eye<00:03:15.690> using<00:03:16.650> the

same with the other eye using the

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.800 
same with the other eye using the
template<00:03:17.220> I've<00:03:17.400> cut<00:03:17.640> out<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:17.970> eyeball<00:03:18.450> so<00:03:18.780> I

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
template I've cut out the eyeball so I

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.510 
template I've cut out the eyeball so I
knew<00:03:19.020> exactly<00:03:19.380> where<00:03:19.709> it'll<00:03:19.860> sit<00:03:20.160> because

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
knew exactly where it'll sit because

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.920 
knew exactly where it'll sit because
when<00:03:20.670> you<00:03:20.760> press<00:03:21.000> it<00:03:21.030> lightly<00:03:21.360> on<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.690> fondant

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
you get a slight imprint and that's

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.880 
you get a slight imprint and that's
where<00:03:24.540> you'll<00:03:24.660> dip<00:03:24.930> in<00:03:25.050> his<00:03:25.200> eye<00:03:25.440> a<00:03:25.470> little<00:03:25.739> bit
