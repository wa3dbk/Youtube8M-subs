00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 but back to a little info video 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.359
 Regarding some information of the 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.500
 You certainly have channels 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.870
 I do not know why me 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.610
 still good but is the channel 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.009
 name has become like this one up here now 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.800
 looks changed in peric and that has one 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.820
 couple of reasons namely, I became more often 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.650
 once addressed and have 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.470
 heard that on maxim stream or 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.500
 on granie stream it was said that me 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.609
 the people can not find and the 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.279
 do not even know if I am in youtube channel 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.929
 because I'm in the known as 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.399
 patrick and that's why I have the whole thing 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.050
 now changed here that is 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.450
 if you are now looking for peric also in 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.250
 the search then you see here videos of 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.920
 carrick and not of cucumber from 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.550
 life is also displayed immediately 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.230
 that that is mine and leaves me 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.270
 then logically easier 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.520
 I identified the canal at that time 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.420
 With three other buddies opened and 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:57.809
 That's why I'm so peric 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.219
 called by hand my god and yes that 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.020
 has become like that after a short time 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.370
 dissolved then was only two with 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.719
 The accident could not have now either 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.939
 really much more time and has 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.810
 then I did not feel like it anymore 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.880
 So I have decided now 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.510
 The channel now often peric to um 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.240
 break up 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.340
 I hope you agree 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:18.000
 that your opinion in any case 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.290
 Very important at the time 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.020
 I thank you for 7400 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.180
 subscribers 7,000 468 are now even 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.040
 at the time of recording here really 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.520
 super I had never thought so before 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.400
 started over a year ago now 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.420
 and really great so me 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.189
 hope there is definitely still 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.840
 some more 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.490
 then to point 3 I was yesterday 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.829
 put a little bit in it and here 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.780
 So some playlist overhauled the 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.520
 whole playlist here completely new 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.870
 made that here too here 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.550
 all follow the 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.590
 yes, all the older ones follow in the 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.270
 playlists are complete you can 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.660
 take a look there and maybe you 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.100
 pull in a few old ones 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.720
 the other is planned in any case 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.580
 now in the near future also others 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.780
 to bring games I'm not at the moment 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.740
 at home that means that can now 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.780
 a bit difficult at the moment 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.760
 But as far as I can realize that 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.280
 I will definitely be at home 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.740
 maybe spend more on both of them 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.130
 more info from pps as well as with you 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.420
 go into patch notes together and yes 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.090
 there will be a lot more in any case 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.190
 we come to the point of face com and stream 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.190
 with the stream will probably still 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.050
 delay a while that means we have 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.090
 An internet is delayed on everyone 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.700
 If anything else I have now exactly 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.900
 no exact date but I get 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.540
 also unfortunately not from mine 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.740
 provider and as soon as I of course 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.470
 I will inform you immediately 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.150
 let face cam that will 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.250
 then logically follow directly 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.910
 when I'm back home that will be yes 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.730
 be a few weeks in any case 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.330
 so do since in any case no 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.700
 thoughts 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.140
 yes otherwise, there are actually times 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.730
 really much to say thanks again 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.459
 every case also for this whole 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.010
 feedback to the video with loca so here me 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:02.970
 just sit there was a lot of negative 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.200
 feedback found some positive feedback 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.610
 I'm still good anyway 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.709
 find your opinion always very important 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.510
 and I am pleased because in any case also 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.000
 if you are honest with me your opinion 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.050
 says and if you also say Peter finished 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.290
 maybe not so good with the logo 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.520
 or pack I think it's super good 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.280
 I just felt important the whole time 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.410
 to create from the world and the whole 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.990
 deep and the whole hate just yes 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.520
 sometimes to leave aside and that's why 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.080
 yes, I am also with the elo casa 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.810
 or pronounced with the fritz 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.310
 and otherwise there is actually more 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.710
 really have something to say you have now 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.870
 So, as I said, everything belongs to peric as 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:40.910
 I now here on youtube 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.900
 the channel banner and the icon will 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.540
 Of course, sometimes the near future 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.000
 I have already changed someone 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.230
 addressed it and yes as I said 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.700
 Look at the old playlist 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.470
 riders are very funny videos 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.410
 I can only recommend you 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:57.970
 and then I would say one else 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.970
 videos are a lot of fun pure skin
