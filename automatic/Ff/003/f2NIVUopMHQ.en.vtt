00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
the transfer box in neutral and yeah the

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.800 
the transfer box in neutral and yeah the
vehicle<00:00:23.789> won't<00:00:23.910> go<00:00:24.119> anywhere

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
vehicle won't go anywhere

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
never though that similar best just to

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:27.260 
never though that similar best just to
show<00:01:20.700> you

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:39.719 

you're<00:01:27.570> bursting<00:01:27.750> light<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.290> on

works<00:01:40.729> another<00:01:41.000> gears<00:01:41.680> second<00:01:43.990> although<00:01:44.990> when

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
works another gears second although when

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.020 
works another gears second although when
you<00:01:45.409> start<00:01:45.710> to<00:01:45.860> work<00:01:46.009> up<00:01:46.220> the<00:01:46.340> gears<00:01:46.610> it<00:01:46.820> makes

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
you start to work up the gears it makes

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.149 
you start to work up the gears it makes
a<00:01:47.299> gearbox<00:01:47.750> louder<00:01:48.229> so<00:01:48.619> I<00:01:48.649> wouldn't<00:01:48.950> recommend

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
a gearbox louder so I wouldn't recommend

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.130 
a gearbox louder so I wouldn't recommend
it<00:01:49.490> but<00:01:49.670> I'm<00:01:50.330> just<00:01:50.509> going<00:01:50.630> to<00:01:50.690> show<00:01:50.869> you<00:01:50.930> for

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
it but I'm just going to show you for

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.910 
it but I'm just going to show you for
video<00:01:51.649> demonstration<00:01:52.369> as<00:01:53.119> in<00:01:53.450> third

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.760 

both<00:01:59.260> see<00:02:00.260> what<00:02:00.410> I<00:02:00.440> mean

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
both see what I mean

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:09.330 
both see what I mean
can<00:02:01.100> I<00:02:01.190> probably<00:02:01.520> hear<00:02:01.790> that

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.530 

foot<00:02:09.940> on<00:02:10.030> the<00:02:10.119> clutch<00:02:11.459> stops<00:02:12.459> noise

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
foot on the clutch stops noise

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.509 
foot on the clutch stops noise
again<00:02:13.959> there's<00:02:14.739> a<00:02:14.830> foots<00:02:15.040> on<00:02:15.190> the<00:02:15.220> clutch<00:02:15.489> just

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
again there's a foots on the clutch just

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.170 
again there's a foots on the clutch just
an<00:02:15.879> hour<00:02:16.000> for<00:02:16.239> liftoff<00:02:17.640> can<00:02:18.640> obviously<00:02:18.910> hear

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
an hour for liftoff can obviously hear

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.050 
an hour for liftoff can obviously hear
it<00:02:20.220> but<00:02:21.220> in<00:02:21.519> Reverse

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.360 

and<00:02:24.540> all<00:02:24.660> this<00:02:24.750> goes

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.240 

first<00:02:30.060> year<00:02:30.709> it's<00:02:31.709> no<00:02:31.860> noisier<00:02:32.370> than<00:02:32.430> that

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
first year it's no noisier than that

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:40.450 
first year it's no noisier than that
so<00:02:34.850> then<00:02:35.060> out<00:02:35.900> back<00:02:36.740> into<00:02:37.040> neutral<00:02:39.160> right<00:02:40.160> down

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
so then out back into neutral right down

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:46.090 
so then out back into neutral right down
that's<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:41.150> range<00:02:42.880> open<00:02:43.880> to<00:02:44.800> high<00:02:45.800> range

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
that's the range open to high range

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.290 
that's the range open to high range
four-wheel<00:02:46.670> drive

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
four-wheel drive

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.670 
four-wheel drive
then<00:02:47.690> push<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:48.620> leave<00:02:48.890> of<00:02:49.100> one<00:02:49.340> more<00:02:49.550> time

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
then push the leave of one more time

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.250 
then push the leave of one more time
that's<00:02:51.680> back<00:02:52.160> into<00:02:52.400> two-wheel<00:02:52.700> drive

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
that's back into two-wheel drive

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.800 
that's back into two-wheel drive
so<00:02:54.260> then<00:02:54.760> obviously<00:02:55.760> put<00:02:56.300> in<00:02:56.450> gear<00:02:56.600> the<00:02:56.660> engine

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
so then obviously put in gear the engine

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:03.790 
so then obviously put in gear the engine
would<00:02:57.170> store<00:02:58.420> so<00:02:59.890> yeah<00:03:02.620> learnt<00:03:03.620> this

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
would store so yeah learnt this

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.310 
would store so yeah learnt this
technique<00:03:04.250> of<00:03:04.550> missing<00:03:05.390> 4x4<00:03:05.930> owners<00:03:06.230> club
