00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:13.790
 I love 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:17.080
 and the best in many spectacular 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.080
 from the amazing florist 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.999
 I feel that it would look better 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.570
 I 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.570
 nicolÃ¡s of transmission 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:39.950
 be a little greener 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.950
 perfectly symmetrical face I'm all 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:49.000
 and they do not know how much more frightening I can be 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.000
 if I keep listening more 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.059
 you wanted to change something about your person 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.850
 To my feet 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.050
 in those days I would have done any 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.050
 thing to hide from others 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.190
 until one night I found the solution 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.190
 perfect for my problem and 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.490
 and stars more times 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:39.120
 you were embarrassed because you wanted 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.330
 your feet were very small they had the 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.040
 smaller feet in my town the feet 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.660
 great givers cost me everything that 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.460
 had managed to save for a long time 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.530
 time in my little piggy 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.930
 they arrived just the time for the dance 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.040
 annual monster picchu around the world 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.040
 it would include 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.700
 and I understood that if assange quads do not 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.830
 it mattered the size of my feet to me 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.810
 because I would care that he liked him 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.849
 To be me 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.640
 the ridiculous worry about part of 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:29.280
 I can not change myself so from 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.690
 from that moment I decided to love every part of 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.760
 myself as it is 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.450
 something to think about when they go back to 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.770
 look in the mirror 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.930
 to 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.040
 the talk of yesterday mari sometimes someone 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:46.959
 more must remind us that the mountain 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.959
 these monstrous imperfections 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.190
 two 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:57.210
 well or gone the big ten are 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.210
 in this season
