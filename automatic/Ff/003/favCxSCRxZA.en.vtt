00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
I was having a lot of trouble getting my

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.250 
I was having a lot of trouble getting my
game<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:29.310> work<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.730> my<00:00:30.660> husband

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
game to work and my husband

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.709 
game to work and my husband
it<00:00:31.560> sounds<00:00:31.890> so<00:00:32.009> weird<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.279> say<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:32.719> Ryan

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
it sounds so weird to say that Ryan

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.790 
it sounds so weird to say that Ryan
actually<00:00:35.210> figured<00:00:36.210> out<00:00:36.360> why<00:00:36.660> I'm<00:00:37.469> having

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
actually figured out why I'm having

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.069 
actually figured out why I'm having
problems<00:00:38.100> with<00:00:38.399> my<00:00:38.460> game<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.210> why<00:00:39.719> probably<00:00:39.930> a

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
problems with my game and why probably a

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.150 
problems with my game and why probably a
lot<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.350> other<00:00:40.500> people<00:00:40.770> are<00:00:40.860> having<00:00:41.040> problems

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
lot of other people are having problems

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.330 
lot of other people are having problems
with<00:00:41.520> their<00:00:41.730> games<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.300> it's<00:00:42.809> because<00:00:43.340> it

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
with their games and it's because it

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.580 
with their games and it's because it
uses<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:44.879> much<00:00:45.059> memory<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:45.930> when<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.200> can't

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
uses so much memory that when it can't

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.180 
uses so much memory that when it can't
use<00:00:46.829> anymore<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.730> just<00:00:47.969> shuts<00:00:48.210> off<00:00:48.440> so<00:00:49.440> that's

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
use anymore it just shuts off so that's

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.770 
use anymore it just shuts off so that's
pretty<00:00:50.430> much<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.700> problem<00:00:51.000> I'm<00:00:51.090> having<00:00:51.149> so

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
pretty much the problem I'm having so

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.889 
pretty much the problem I'm having so
anytime<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.350> memory<00:00:52.649> just<00:00:52.920> hits<00:00:53.280> its<00:00:53.520> peak

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
anytime the memory just hits its peak

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.010 
anytime the memory just hits its peak
the<00:00:54.899> game<00:00:55.050> just<00:00:55.260> disappears<00:00:56.449> so<00:00:57.449> this<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.870> the

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
the game just disappears so this is the

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.799 
the game just disappears so this is the
house<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.620> first<00:00:59.070> sim<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.699> made<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.480> create

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
house of the first sim I made and create

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.840 
house of the first sim I made and create
a<00:01:00.899> sim<00:01:01.140> with<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.500> sims<00:01:01.770> 3<00:01:04.460> yeah<00:01:05.460> it's<00:01:05.610> kind<00:01:05.820> of

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
a sim with the sims 3 yeah it's kind of

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.800 
a sim with the sims 3 yeah it's kind of
hard<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.060> control<00:01:06.450> with<00:01:06.720> one<00:01:06.960> hand<00:01:07.320> um<00:01:08.280> I

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
hard to control with one hand um I

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.440 
hard to control with one hand um I
really<00:01:09.810> don't<00:01:10.020> like<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.619> oversized<00:01:11.400> Z's<00:01:12.030> I

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
really don't like the oversized Z's I

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.770 
really don't like the oversized Z's I
mean<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:12.930> thought<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.320> Z's<00:01:13.650> in<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.509> sims<00:01:15.509> 2

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
mean I thought the Z's in the sims 2

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.730 
mean I thought the Z's in the sims 2
were<00:01:16.020> bad<00:01:16.229> but<00:01:16.710> these<00:01:16.890> things<00:01:17.250> are<00:01:17.460> just<00:01:17.640> huge

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
were bad but these things are just huge

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.170 
were bad but these things are just huge
it's<00:01:19.740> like<00:01:19.890> she<00:01:20.130> ate<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.430> huge<00:01:20.880> bowl<00:01:21.150> of

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
it's like she ate a huge bowl of

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.030 
it's like she ate a huge bowl of
alphabet<00:01:21.420> soup<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.259> all<00:01:22.350> she's<00:01:22.590> doing<00:01:22.830> is

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
alphabet soup and all she's doing is

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.090 
alphabet soup and all she's doing is
throwing<00:01:23.310> them<00:01:23.520> up<00:01:23.670> all<00:01:23.820> night<00:01:24.000> um<00:01:24.890> yeah

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
throwing them up all night um yeah

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.870 
throwing them up all night um yeah
this<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.460> weird<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:28.310> what's<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.400> gain<00:01:29.579> it

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
this is weird and what's the gain it

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.910 
this is weird and what's the gain it
crashed<00:01:30.180> all<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:30.780> did<00:01:31.140> was<00:01:31.320> have<00:01:31.500> her<00:01:31.619> get<00:01:31.829> up

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
crashed all I did was have her get up

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.590 
crashed all I did was have her get up
out<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.100> bed<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.520> can<00:01:32.549> actually<00:01:32.850> zoom<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.479> on

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
out of bed so I can actually zoom in on

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.719 
out of bed so I can actually zoom in on
her<00:01:33.689> face<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.170> show<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:35.159> nothing<00:01:35.460> crashed

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
her face to show you and nothing crashed

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.020 
her face to show you and nothing crashed
so<00:01:36.390> I'm<00:01:36.750> starting<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.350> over<00:01:37.560> again<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:38.040> guess

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
so I'm starting it over again I guess

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.030 
so I'm starting it over again I guess
the<00:01:39.210> positive<00:01:39.390> thing<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.350> takes<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.860> two

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
the positive thing is it takes a two

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.219 
the positive thing is it takes a two
seconds<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.759> get<00:01:42.210> back<00:01:42.360> into<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.780> game<00:01:42.930> as

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
seconds to get back into the game as

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.080 
seconds to get back into the game as
opposed<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.890> my<00:01:44.040> Sims<00:01:44.340> 2<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:44.820> would<00:01:44.939> take

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
opposed to my Sims 2 that would take

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.910 
opposed to my Sims 2 that would take
about<00:01:45.210> 40<00:01:45.659> minutes<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:46.110> load<00:01:46.259> because<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.619> all

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
about 40 minutes to load because of all

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.630 
about 40 minutes to load because of all
the<00:01:47.250> gigs<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.909> gigs<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.240> down<00:01:48.390> flipped<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.780> had

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
the gigs and gigs of down flipped I had

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.490 
the gigs and gigs of down flipped I had
so<00:01:50.640> I'm<00:01:51.030> now<00:01:51.210> loading<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.689> game<00:01:51.840> for<00:01:52.290> the

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
so I'm now loading the game for the

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.030 
so I'm now loading the game for the
millions<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.220> time<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:53.579> seems<00:01:54.619> well<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.829> just
