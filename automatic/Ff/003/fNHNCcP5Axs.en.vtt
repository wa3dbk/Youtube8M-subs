00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:14.190
 hello everyone my name is Dasha and today 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.850
 I want to show how to make a cup if 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:21.779
 for ours who so they can 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:25.099
 weigh different foods and so us 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:31.380
 metal will need clay 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:34.520
 two box two identical caps from 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:40.399
 kefir or milk 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:46.039
 then the wire and I have it soft 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:52.620
 bend a piece of tubule 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:55.670
 thin planka scissors self-adhesive 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.760
 the paper I took is blue 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:03.930
 nippers crepe pull or other 7 glue 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:08.060
 well then let's get down we take our 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:12.510
 two box smear here with glue and 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:15.479
 glue them this way together in 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:19.820
 the window already glued them together so i have 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:22.979
 it turned out now we take our paper and 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:27.090
 paste over and if you do not have paper then 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:30.390
 you can paint here I pasted it 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:34.470
 us our base of our scales and so 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.590
 I got it and now we will do 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.439
 our main detail of the lower cup 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.869
 weights for this we take our wire 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:48.619
 and a piece of the straw we cut the straw 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:53.880
 less than the width of our two glued together 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:55.840
 cut off the boxes and take our 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.740
 wire 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.100
 our very tubule and bend our 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.140
 box as a rectangle 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.679
 Here I am from the body and so I have 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.019
 it turned out I decided to twist this 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:14.310
 wire because I have it very 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:16.269
 very soft I got now 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.980
 we take our 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:26.709
 This detail and glue it in the middle 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:31.269
 on the bottom I'll stick now 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:34.150
 So I wandered our detail and the main thing is to 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:35.290
 you could have this tube quietly 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.099
 is spinning 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:43.510
 we take our planochka size 6 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:46.030
 centimeters and measure out the middle here at 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:50.890
 we are three centimeters and here also 3 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:54.459
 centimeters of the company take it and take our 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:58.480
 lids here on this lid and on this 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:03:05.190
 got along in the middle so small 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:09.250
 the answer to our middle and we take and 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:11.680
 this way we glue our 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:15.849
 plan to our cap 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:20.609
 I'm gluing now 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:24.579
 I did it and now where we are 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:28.690
 marked our middle turn over and 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:32.200
 so glue our tubules 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:37.660
 I already stuck and our cups I do not 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:39.040
 I can swing so important that you can 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.609
 stick ru 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:47.280
 and I took clay from plasticine blinded 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:47.280
 and such here or a different size 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:53.000
 such here 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:54.790
 and now you can take the letter to hang 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.610
 our products 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:02.480
 but let's try to weigh 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.650
 so I took two cakes and she herself 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:09.770
 big 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:14.709
 divide and weighed and we have a whole 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:20.950
 kilogram your deliciouss now bottles 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:25.820
