00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.580
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:24.070
 new fashion review mod conception under 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:28.390
 this time the yes what he needs it all 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:30.700
 clearly I want to pack the link in the 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.110
 description and then mod to the 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.610
 download pack also in the 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.780
 description and of course minecraft yes 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.030
 then we start with the first 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.910
 installation comes later in the 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:46.650
 contrary than it should be, the windows 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:49.600
 hold down and then comes in 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:01:00.970
 kästchen run and then have a 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:01:03.579
 give if he did that 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.960
 now a roaming folder and each one 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:09.189
 Albums minecraft folder opponents easy 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:12.970
 Let's go then into the versus 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:15.369
 folder is important then we are doing now 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.490
 a copy as we make right click 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:20.200
 and then you copy too 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.860
 right click once and open 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.510
 insert 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:28.420
 then we have the copy we 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.790
 want here now purely so I give 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.200
 Now we have a folder 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.229
 of course you can rename that 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:39.880
 any yes I take now also three 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:41.890
 mini med and then yes have the 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:47.380
 So we go to the folder 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:50.470
 into rename the same way we 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.590
 the folder named and with me it is 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.900
 now three mini map and you can 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.100
 for example blabla the place one 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:02.140
 that would have to stay that way too 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.439
 the song names then you open that 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.439
 with me 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:12.360
 we have with editor so i do now 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.520
 and there is 1.723 again 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.610
 We had to call the others the same way 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.910
 So has three files too 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.240
 then rub my case on file 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:29.430
 to save 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:31.080
 and that was not so nice then yes 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:36.680
 then we have to go here for years now 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:41.240
 Open the file with winrar archive and 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.240
 delete first the tenant in ford makes 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.990
 then just open this folder and 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:55.980
 then drag in the two files 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:57.330
 the folder and would like to do it 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.280
 then we can do it all times 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:05.240
 go close on minecraft it takes 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.240
 to stay a little longer 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.160
 You can then either a new one 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.120
 create a profile or just a lot 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.670
 meditate so it is the profile 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.290
 edit and you can also new 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.540
 Do that what you do when you do that 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.580
 then edited just go there on it I 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.560
 let it be that way and then 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.890
 we look here is minimized 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.520
 as well as the murder order as official we 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.930
 that it per case 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:39.670
 you can also name it here 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:42.989
 For example, change something about that then 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.520
 so then made it to play and 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:49.410
 we expect the vines to be minimized 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.410
 showing off is always within reach 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:04:03.700
 I'm not exactly sure but I go up 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:07.420
 the courage in the mother and we see that 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:11.260
 right here in the picture we can already see 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:20.280
 Secret nobody under three mini map are 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:20.280
 then increase the coordinates higher higher then 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.200
 in any case, left and right 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.169
 The accounts have where you go 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.729
 can see f3 on here 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:32.520
 and when you press it then we have 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:35.500
 different options 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.320
 rémi reiss minimap we can now if 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:41.020
 i now here in ableton same then 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.270
 If they want to leave then we can 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.750
 display deftones and die 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:49.620
 would it would since I always take my 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.620
 for hedges, for example 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:05:02.679
 Come in here and I will 

00:04:55.059 --> 00:05:04.419
 They die and then we come 

00:05:02.679 --> 00:05:09.729
 even then waypoint as you like 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:14.860
 set and how and how to display the 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:16.179
 is and i did that here 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:20.309
 a little bit on now but I'm sorry 

00:05:16.179 --> 00:05:20.309
 I would show it to you 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:32.020
 now I have died here and now 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:35.770
 shows from the top right of the rich with 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:39.440
 offering an arrow already received 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:43.180
 Much died here and there could be 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:45.770
 Now pick up my items again and 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:50.600
 yes then you can do it again 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:53.450
 Get rid of the call that goes knows 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.940
 also add something and give in there 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:06:00.200
 but asks if it's easier if 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:02.810
 I push now and you can below 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:07.370
 here the colors adjust more reddish 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:09.440
 with yellowish brownish and here are the 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.990
 coordinates where he is currently standing 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:15.320
 example at the construction and you can now 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:16.450
 Enter house someday just once 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.770
 at the 1 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:21.140
 and then here would be a waypoint 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.000
 represent and I could 1000 now 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:27.430
 walk away and it would be me 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:30.710
 way back to the tree view as well 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.970
 and then you can also make up again 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.010
 if you do not want to see that, you can 

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.510
 Doing so often then is automatic 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:39.410
 not gone you can do it but then 

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:46.270
 again could make turn on again 

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:46.270
 and you can be sad too 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:53.940
 then there is still minimap option 

00:06:51.569 --> 00:06:55.800
 you can, for example, the textures of 

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.470
 the mini map for the rimini more brother 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.870
 insert for dental minimap 

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:04.370
 the same had only collect the 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:08.669
 so far looks with tolerably 

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:10.080
 and yes that's it from now on 

00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:12.300
 my video and i would be on the 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.370
 abo or like pleased delight 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:16.490
 and then I want to say that until the next one 

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:16.490
 times
