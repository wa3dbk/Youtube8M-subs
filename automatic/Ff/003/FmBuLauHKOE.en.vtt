00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.350
 tt - helfen.de the table tennis magazine 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:11.450
 for your region news and interviews from 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.450
 the Kreisklasse to the Bundesliga 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.160
 I would say well but I do not know 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.750
 exactly 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.460
 I had now first examination of oli 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.350
 do not you come to train so much but 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.350
 I think that fits quite well 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.370
 to do a little more 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.899
 maybe not optimal but mine 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.899
 best thing was done 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.480
 not look good really all 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.280
 team is relatively poorly helped 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.230
 in the single-track second league comes 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:54.090
 thus only the to 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.090
 after that we do not copy that 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.820
 less I always have a camera 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.090
 there 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.440
 so there I am helped 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.540
 almost always someone with the 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.790
 cameraman outfitter also my hero of 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.630
 sponsor and friendship because of this 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.630
 to which I must address 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.970
 time is my equipment and in the process 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:20.470
 great so if I have questions 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.360
 try somehow or something new 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.549
 I would like to always be current 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.740
 and vest but i am actually somebody 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:29.729
 He likes to be with the old-fashioned one 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.729
 somehow continue playing 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.290
 I'm pretty sure after graduating from high school 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.330
 me two years time as a pro so me 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.979
 my adolescence is good and very good 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.119
 then in the 23 years then came 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.570
 clear jump 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:49.380
 I started number 80 words in 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.100
 of the ranking and at the end of the championship 10 11 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.500
 12 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.310
 by far the biggest jump of it's time 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.310
 I also have a relationship now 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.620
 So try to play table tennis 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.540
 right then sport specific and 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.990
 then besides still as often as possible in times 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.119
 power room visitors to run 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:14.400
 always as it offers no profi 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.400
 that means if over you fever or 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.600
 Everybody makes things relatively easy 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.000
 results-forth and the form it 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.550
 Last year at the German 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.550
 championships against tree 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.130
 then 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.600
 is again even space then were 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.470
 We glad German championships though 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.810
 Otherwise , I believe every week 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:54.390
 In the end, if I change now 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:57.620
 sometimes 20 25 or more win the 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.620
 amazon snapshot 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.909
 it's something completely different what I am 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.620
 not understood now 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:06.510
 here are many tables is one 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.260
 huge hall people are relative 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.230
 wants far 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.010
 and since the times as the airport 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.159
 So a table 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.240
 everything right at the box commentators 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:18.870
 cabin 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.280
 is better transmitted light show 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.410
 somehow watching from thoughts 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.380
 I already have something that atmosphere 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.390
 built what I believe here in disco 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.930
 miss maybe I miss it 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:34.440
 not to be made which completely 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.440
 another time 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:43.110
 biggest no hour 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:45.060
 young people make it understandable 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.320
 So you do not know why now 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.390
 the rebellion was not got 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.190
 but it goes back and forth and 10 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.380
 placement and speed 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.040
 no longer so these fancies and 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.040
 be crazy 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.620
