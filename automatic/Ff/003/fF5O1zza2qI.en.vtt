horrid TV the world is thinking you for

horrid TV the world is thinking you for
instance<00:00:08.790> you<00:00:09.269> know<00:00:09.360> your<00:00:09.540> eyesight<00:00:09.929> isn't

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
instance you know your eyesight isn't

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.169 
instance you know your eyesight isn't
great<00:00:10.230> so<00:00:10.380> you<00:00:10.620> wear<00:00:10.769> glasses<00:00:11.130> things<00:00:12.000> like

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
great so you wear glasses things like

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:13.789 
great so you wear glasses things like
this<00:00:12.330> do<00:00:12.509> you<00:00:12.540> think<00:00:12.630> we're<00:00:13.320> affecting

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
this do you think we're affecting

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.960 
this do you think we're affecting
evolution<00:00:14.280> in<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.490> negative<00:00:14.820> way<00:00:15.139> well<00:00:16.139> I<00:00:16.970> I'm

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
evolution in a negative way well I I'm

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.830 
evolution in a negative way well I I'm
68<00:00:18.539> years<00:00:18.690> old<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.740> therefore<00:00:20.060> I<00:00:21.060> mean

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
68 years old and therefore I mean

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.960 
68 years old and therefore I mean
anybody<00:00:22.380> of<00:00:22.560> my<00:00:22.740> age<00:00:22.920> has<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.369> wear<00:00:23.519> them<00:00:23.789> has

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
anybody of my age has to wear them has

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.490 
anybody of my age has to wear them has
to<00:00:24.119> wear<00:00:24.240> glasses<00:00:24.449> genetically<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:25.289> have

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
to wear glasses genetically I have

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.019 
to wear glasses genetically I have
rather<00:00:25.680> good<00:00:25.949> eyesight<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:26.580> mean<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:26.730> didn't

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
rather good eyesight I mean I didn't

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.580 
rather good eyesight I mean I didn't
actually<00:00:27.180> need<00:00:27.480> glasses<00:00:27.750> until<00:00:28.230> I<00:00:28.320> was<00:00:28.439> about

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
actually need glasses until I was about

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.650 
actually need glasses until I was about
450<00:00:29.570> and<00:00:30.570> so<00:00:31.640> but<00:00:32.640> you're<00:00:32.969> quite<00:00:33.270> right<00:00:33.480> but

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
450 and so but you're quite right but

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.880 
450 and so but you're quite right but
there<00:00:33.809> are<00:00:33.930> many<00:00:34.110> people<00:00:34.320> who<00:00:34.559> do<00:00:34.739> need

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
there are many people who do need

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.670 
there are many people who do need
glasses<00:00:35.190> at<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.030> young<00:00:36.300> age<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.840> there

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
glasses at a young age and there

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.090 
glasses at a young age and there
probably<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.579> genetic<00:00:39.329> defect<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:40.100> that's

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
probably is a genetic defect and that's

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.770 
probably is a genetic defect and that's
a<00:00:41.219> comparatively<00:00:41.879> trivial<00:00:42.000> one<00:00:42.360> although<00:00:42.510> in

a comparatively trivial one although in

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.840 
a comparatively trivial one although in
the<00:00:42.870> world<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.230> nature<00:00:43.440> if<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.520> were<00:00:45.829> so

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
the world of nature if you were so

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.520 
the world of nature if you were so
short-sighted<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.329> couldn't<00:00:48.750> see<00:00:49.050> an

then<00:00:53.309> up<00:00:54.149> from<00:00:54.210> this<00:00:54.570> obvious<00:00:55.020> survival<00:00:55.500> value

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
then up from this obvious survival value

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.939 
then up from this obvious survival value
in<00:00:55.949> in<00:00:56.280> having<00:00:56.640> good<00:00:57.210> good<00:00:57.719> eyesight<00:00:58.109> by<00:00:58.890> the
