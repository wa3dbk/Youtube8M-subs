00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
the more expensive each commodity

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.859 
the more expensive each commodity
becomes<00:01:53.229> as<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:54.219> price<00:01:54.460> depends<00:01:55.240> on<00:01:55.420> supply

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
becomes as the price depends on supply

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:57.300 
becomes as the price depends on supply
and<00:01:55.899> demand

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
and demand

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.450 
and demand
so<00:01:57.909> when<00:01:58.060> the<00:01:58.180> supply<00:01:58.450> drops<00:01:58.930> the<00:01:59.590> price<00:01:59.740> rises

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
so when the supply drops the price rises

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.770 
so when the supply drops the price rises
