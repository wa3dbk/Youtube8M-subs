00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
going on obviously quite a bit of

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.070 
going on obviously quite a bit of
acoustical<00:02:39.580> foam<00:02:39.880> on<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.270> inside<00:02:40.300> of<00:02:40.960> this

acoustical foam on the inside of this

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.220 
acoustical foam on the inside of this
thing<00:02:41.410> here<00:02:41.710> so<00:02:42.640> no<00:02:43.450> interference<00:02:44.140> from

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
thing here so no interference from

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.910 
thing here so no interference from
outside<00:02:44.490> keeps<00:02:45.490> it<00:02:45.700> quiet<00:02:45.850> and<00:02:46.920> concentrates
