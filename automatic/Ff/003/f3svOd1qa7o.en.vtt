00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.080
 You start with a mousse to stiffen the hair 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.001
 The point is that the hair ... 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.180
 ... can be fixed a bit and will be tighter later 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.440
 The brush... 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.860
 ... to make a nice tight tail 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.420
 so that you are ready for it all evening 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.000
 The tail may be a bit higher up the head 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.320
 so that the donut will be clearly visible 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.000
 This may well be a bit more neutral, it does not have to be very tight 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.540
 Then you grab the donut - this device - 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.860
 It can be wrapped around the other rubber band 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.700
 just like a normal rubber band 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.260
 So 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.840
 Then the tail up 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.300
 and let yourself be as it were 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.200
 the whole fall over the hair 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.100
 That looks like something 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.780
 so that the donut is no longer visible 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.780
 and only your own hair falls all over the donut 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.720
 The mail order rubber band 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.720
 twice around your hand 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.480
 and you let it fall around like that 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.480
 and then you raise the donut slightly 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.556
 So that it comes loose 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.940
 And then you fold the hair around the rubber band 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.140
 And you secure the whole 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.820
 with a slider pin 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.820
 that can be one or two 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.100
 A little bit under my hair 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.360
 The donut is ready in itself 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.520
 For the finishing touch, a little spray 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.840
 And we are ready for the evening!
