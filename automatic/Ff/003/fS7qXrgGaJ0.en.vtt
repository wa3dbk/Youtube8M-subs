washing takes the water jumps always a
good<00:01:38.159> indicator<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.640> fitness<00:01:39.060> doesn't<00:01:39.509> go<00:01:39.659> for

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
good indicator of fitness doesn't go for

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.080 
good indicator of fitness doesn't go for
that<00:01:40.049> too<00:01:40.290> much<00:01:40.439> but<00:01:40.860> powers<00:01:41.310> up<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.610> inverted

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
that too much but powers up the inverted

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.719 
that too much but powers up the inverted
V<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:43.079> nicely<00:01:43.439> into<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.890> second<00:01:44.189> water<00:01:44.399> and

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
V and nicely into the second water and

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.550 
V and nicely into the second water and
Steve<00:01:45.060> just<00:01:45.270> runs<00:01:45.570> across<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.930> water<00:01:46.350> almost

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
Steve just runs across the water almost

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.410 
Steve just runs across the water almost
ignoring<00:01:47.189> it

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
ignoring it

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.450 
ignoring it
powers<00:01:47.780> up<00:01:48.110> and<00:01:48.350> down<00:01:48.500> the<00:01:48.710> inverted<00:01:49.130> V<00:01:49.280> and

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
powers up and down the inverted V and

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.740 
powers up and down the inverted V and
he's<00:01:49.610> going<00:01:49.820> well<00:01:49.939> just<00:01:49.970> falls<00:01:50.360> back<00:01:50.570> with

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
he's going well just falls back with

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:51.910 
he's going well just falls back with
their<00:01:50.869> that<00:01:51.049> will<00:01:51.170> lose<00:01:51.350> him<00:01:51.500> a<00:01:51.590> couple<00:01:51.770> of

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
their that will lose him a couple of

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.640 
their that will lose him a couple of
seconds<00:01:52.310> Sally<00:01:53.210> struggling<00:01:53.810> a<00:01:54.020> fraction<00:01:54.470> now

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
seconds Sally struggling a fraction now

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.370 
seconds Sally struggling a fraction now
but<00:01:55.400> the<00:01:55.790> battle<00:01:56.119> between<00:01:56.270> was<00:01:56.750> even<00:01:57.170> Steve

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
but the battle between was even Steve

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.170 
but the battle between was even Steve
event<00:01:57.710> I<00:01:57.830> can<00:01:57.860> still<00:01:58.340> produce<00:01:58.580> one<00:01:58.970> of<00:01:59.060> those

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
event I can still produce one of those

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.510 
event I can still produce one of those

that's the terribleness of that now
let's<00:02:16.430> give<00:02:16.670> them<00:02:16.730> Steven<00:02:17.030> had<00:02:17.269> a<00:02:17.300> chance<00:02:17.569> to

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
landing at all from waseem and that most

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.770 
landing at all from waseem and that most
evil<00:02:22.640> they<00:02:22.760> should<00:02:23.120> have<00:02:23.209> got<00:02:23.420> some<00:02:23.600> dice<00:02:23.750> in

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
evil they should have got some dice in

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.539 
evil they should have got some dice in
the<00:02:24.019> water<00:02:24.200> there<00:02:24.500> so<00:02:24.950> what's<00:02:25.130> him<00:02:25.280> heading

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
the water there so what's him heading

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:27.699 
the water there so what's him heading
now<00:02:25.700> for<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.209> last<00:02:26.480> obstacle<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:27.230> flat<00:02:27.440> nets

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
now for the last obstacle the flat nets

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.009 
now for the last obstacle the flat nets
and<00:02:28.250> steve<00:02:28.670> ovett<00:02:28.940> light<00:02:29.209> on<00:02:29.390> his<00:02:29.510> trail<00:02:29.780> down

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
and steve ovett light on his trail down

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.350 
and steve ovett light on his trail down
so<00:02:30.350> it<00:02:30.410> will<00:02:30.530> be<00:02:30.560> decided<00:02:31.160> under<00:02:31.250> that<00:02:31.549> nets<00:02:31.819> by

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
so it will be decided under that nets by

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.600 
so it will be decided under that nets by
technique<00:02:32.959> by<00:02:33.260> strength<00:02:33.620> by<00:02:33.830> determination

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
technique by strength by determination
