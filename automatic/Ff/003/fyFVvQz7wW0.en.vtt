00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.819
 hi to all and axel tests mobile.fr 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.280
 we are at IFA 2014 on the stand of 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:11.870
 ricoh and I have in hand the rainbow 4g 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.309
 so mbow you know it's a 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.179
 device that already exist that we have 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.550
 besides tested 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:17.990
 this one is just the 4g edition so 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.720
 at the level of the specs we have what a 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:24.770
 terminal so 4g as I said 5 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:27.320
 inches hd android 4.4 quad-core 1.3 8 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.619
 megapixels at the back 2 megapixels at 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.989
 the front 8 gigabytes of internal memory 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.340
 we have a gig of ram possibility of 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.340
 put a micro sd and extend up 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.130
 32 gigas and we will have it in a 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.840
 mood this color at the price level 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.370
 is it we have it I do not know no anymore 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.239
 did not rate the price because they 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.280
 did not give it I think they did not 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.930
 not that's it they have not got it right yet 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.640
 short no matter but it's the rainbow 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.289
 in his kadje edition apparently 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.629
 the fact of bringing the 4g that will add 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.120
 not even 20 30 euros it seems to me it's 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.260
 what I was told so on the bench I 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.520
 will go through it quickly because 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.600
 that if you want to see the test of this 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.270
 device I invite you first and foremost to 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.460
 look at the rat mbow test but there we 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.470
 to the front camera the audio output 4 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.460
 sensors the classic buttons at the bottom 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:13.340
 back home and menus on the right 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:17.960
 lock unlock the jack 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:19.460
 micro usb volume the microphone behind 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.479
 the camera with his flash on the 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.810
 side and then after in the interface 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.920
 as usual it's standard 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.680
 what do we have that what we have 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.270
 in there interfaces that we know 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.350
 well the rise in German you 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.210
 do not worry you will be able to master it by 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.189
 French can take a picture very 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.509
 quickly here it is it is reactive this 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.850
 device it's true that when I go 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:42.350
 test the first rainbow on Thursday that the 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.820
 test is actually published no I have to 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.500
 still do the video I just got there 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.540
 think I have to do it in the process of 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.200
 ifa de gaulle you will have it 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.960
 do not worry then if not good this is it 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.850
 says it's basic basic we'll say 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.619
 classic android is not much to 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.360
 say except that here you 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.100
 know with that to 4g normally 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.270
 for a price that is not very high I 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.299
 do not have them in mind I'm really 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.590
 sorry but it seems to me that the rainbow 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.390
 he was really not very very expensive 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.759
 so there you still had 5 inches 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.489
 hd a nice device good performance 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.319
 4g for a relatively small price has 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.360
 priori because yes that anyway 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.280
 it's never very fun on 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.569
 price that's why they are 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.510
 besides very well placed in France 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.099
 today is elsewhere finally good here it is 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.840
 this rainbow kg tell me what you in 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.459
 think it's a mbo simply with 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.590
 the 4g how much the 4g can be 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.030
 interesting for you do you 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.440
 use it what you did not use it 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.610
 if you do not use it and you do not have 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.840
 not a 4g device is that what you 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.340
 would possibly interest is what 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.319
 the prices are too high for now 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.629
 not exactly yes that trying to propose 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.890
 4g devices not too expensive 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:44.890
 see you soon
