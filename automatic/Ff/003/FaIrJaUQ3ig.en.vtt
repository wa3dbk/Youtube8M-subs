00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.800
 He rode on the left side of the 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.110
 fields of the bbva league for 15 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.560
 seasons 12 in the real society and 3 in 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.560
 the real zaragoza 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.630
 retired for six years Augustine 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.550
 aranzábal enjoys as a fan more 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.630
 of the bright present and prosperous future 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.630
 of the real society 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.960
 born in san sebastián to son of 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.879
 footballer seemed to be a player of the 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.879
 real was written in his destiny 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.579
 I also think that the real and 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.519
 Well, I 've always had the kind of 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:01:00.079
 says the ball at home at all times 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:02.390
 it was like leaving school and it was football 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.610
 in the rest certainly not in the 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.170
 recess was soccer at noon before 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.149
 after before and after eating it was 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.340
 football then apart they go back to the help 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:13.159
 of having at home a person who 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.720
 knows what the world of football is and 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.520
 He has lived it in his flesh not only because 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.950
 it's an advantage for me it was an advantage 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.690
 school when his father joseph Augustine 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.759
 aranzábal retired the family was 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.530
 moved to Vergara a small town of 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:27.659
 the province of guipúzcoa 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.490
 and in the sports club vergara aranzábal 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.200
 he started playing football although it was in 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.729
 the real society where he took the leap 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.729
 definitive to professionalism 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:43.299
 it's the biggest thing for a kid that is 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:45.250
 of the province of Guipúzcoa and perhaps a 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:47.860
 goddess sebastián but may have been 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.840
 years also in bergara and consider me 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.990
 also very bergarés I have to say 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.540
 well impressive I do not think that for 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.070
 any child that of any ikastola 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.960
 you ask here is as good wants 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.700
 be a footballer and social network 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.640
 I was a dream in the end done fact 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.830
 reality and after entering with three 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.769
 years in what was the club of the great 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.340
 society with a lot of years and I have 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:13.170
 thanking the mayor city 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.489
 It is not always easy to integrate into the 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.970
 wardrobe of a first team 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.190
 division 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.400
 the landing of aranzábal in the one of the 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.970
 real society was placid 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.260
 we got two other players too 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.110
 together we arrived three players and good 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.939
 we had the support one from the other not and 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.480
 then apart from that good since long 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:34.650
 It has always been very, very good, I think 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.480
 in all the years that I was never 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.640
 seen no problem so much with 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.260
 the people from outside like the people from home 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.620
 and in that sense there was always a group 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.620
 one 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.360
 the 2002-2003 season was the most 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.819
 successful of the real society from the 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.560
 beginning of the 80s that 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.480
 campaign the team from San Sebastian ended 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.910
 second and he qualified to play the 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.200
 league of champions that was the greatest 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.200
 sports success of aranzábal 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.360
 today I can get into champions 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.800
 after so many years that we had 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.080
 got 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.210
 yes it is true that there is a new 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.830
 football I think we have a great 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:25.370
 team with great players but 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:31.290
 also previous years according to 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:33.240
 70 a year that plays what it was 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.850
 then uefa 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.130
 good in the course of eleven 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.200
 seasons because there are not always moments 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.270
 good and bad and maybe because these 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.230
 it can be the two do not stop at that 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.510
 moment for the club 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:49.190
 for the traveling team and it would go to 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.190
 Europe will be very important 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.340
 of that team of the subchampionship 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.580
 Agustín Aranzábal remembers Javi de 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.880
 Pedro as the most talented player 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.950
 few curves I've seen as the part 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:09.070
 of the train a left very very good 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:12.310
 exquisite I would say the level of quality 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.510
 of combining game era of the 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.260
 players that when we give the ball 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:19.440
 you knew how good he said he was going to 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.540
 lose a ball alone 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.160
 here also down because there were many 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.820
 players also continuous when the 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.540
 moment to take them out 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.540
 the carpenter 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:38.550
 mikel aranburu apart we agree a 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.550
 very good generation highlighting some 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.050
 Augustin Aranzábal remembers his brilliant 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.580
 playing days in the Royal Society and 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.650
 now delights with the new generation 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:53.450
 of zubieta has been taken again to the 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.450
 San Sebastian team to travel around Europe
