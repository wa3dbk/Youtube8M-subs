00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.720
 And then people who like to boot from the galley 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.790
 We're on the fu drag today I have 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.489
 A surprise for you, I'll talk. 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.990
 with our friend Bonamigo is one of the 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.130
 organizers of the center-west cup 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.840
 ripped off 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.210
 Today we are in the third cup in the 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.050
 third stage today the subject is not 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.150
 the cup the subject is your next car 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.770
 Good, we come here to see you. 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.510
 first we want to know the 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.979
 your car's configuration in the 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.650
 category that you walk, what is your 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.840
 car well the design of my car 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.880
 initially was in the category b 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.369
 included was the category that we 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.759
 We walked past year in Curitiba 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:38.149
 velopark maringá and here in the cup 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:41.840
 center-west in the first step we 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:44.899
 we bought a pair of slick tires and 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.820
 we also decided to give in the area and the car 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:49.340
 having a very good performance up to 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.550
 account that it is designed to walk 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.910
 400 meters then in 201 although he 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:58.009
 be an 8 valve he he walks right here 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.720
 Already then let's go if you already said that you would 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.790
 eight valves to speak for which is the 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:06.260
 engine that you use in your car no 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:09.410
 engine is 1 is an apê is a turn of 20 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:12.950
 it gives a little more than two thousand 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.590
 and is a turbo car is a 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.450
 eight-valve cross- flow head 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:22.160
 turbine with what I use is a garrett 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.780
 roledado a gt r 40 and 88 of equipment 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.269
 of electronics you use in the case of 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.530
 Injection control equipment 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:33.560
 is the one that monitors every part of 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:37.790
 engine monitoring is everything was the 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:40.730
 tek so that 's what everyone uses today 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:44.600
 does not have a f 400 has bust found has 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:47.780
 Control guide is all that is needed is 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.620
 in terms of electronics to have 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.420
 a good performance 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.130
 it is the case that he has a good electronics already 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.820
 Did you notice that it 's a cool system. 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.920
 have complete management has date 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.660
 logger also works with 11 also 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.150
 I have a test 24 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.380
 so it's mostly in turbo b if it does 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.950
 necessary we have enough 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.310
 front wheel sensor information and 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.310
 back to see what 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.690
 how much she was parking she is 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.060
 turning the lead more than the 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.520
 back is a way for us to do the 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.930
 circus as sure as a car with the 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.980
 embedded technology very good as well 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.720
 complete right? 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.920
 and now tell us the question of 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.080
 record né 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.940
 You beat yesterday the record in the 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.040
 turbo to speak of the new sensation of beating 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.900
 the record in twice in a row 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.690
 neither do I expect you to put it in the air 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.370
 also the video there will have a bit of 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.540
 My party inside the car is 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.239
 really good right 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:42.569
 and still remember it was rather 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:46.580
 significant because it was 74 there we 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:49.620
 we turned 72 yesterday and then download 02 there 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.959
 Who knows who is upset knows 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.090
 which is not easy then we download and 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.590
 thank you very much, God is the 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.060
 People think it's little but for 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.489
 ripped off this is a gigantic time 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.200
 even in the straight line from a distance 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.660
 car is great with others 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.360
 with this difference and good in the thousand brigade 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.980
 Congratulations, fight and let's continue 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.750
 beating us up the records right there 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.060
 Let's see if today much more today, let's go. 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.480
 try to hit the beauty b goes now 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.480
 hug
