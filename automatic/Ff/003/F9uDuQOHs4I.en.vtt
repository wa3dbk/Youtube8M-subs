make just right was these guys getting

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.149 
make just right was these guys getting

kilo<00:01:38.610> spin<00:01:39.060> stick<00:01:39.360> this<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.689> called<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.930> 702<00:01:40.439> H

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
kilo spin stick this is called the 702 H

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.010 
kilo spin stick this is called the 702 H
looks<00:01:41.400> like<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.579> one<00:01:41.850> piece<00:01:42.060> right<00:01:42.360> here<00:01:42.390> but

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
looks like a one piece right here but

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.510 
looks like a one piece right here but
it's<00:01:43.140> two<00:01:43.350> piece<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.799> joins<00:01:44.009> in<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.369> butt

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
it's two piece it joins in the butt

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.520 
it's two piece it joins in the butt
section<00:01:44.790> which<00:01:45.450> makes<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.780> again<00:01:46.049> easier<00:01:46.470> for

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
section which makes it again easier for

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.560 
section which makes it again easier for
travelling<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.369> taper<00:01:47.670> on<00:01:47.820> this<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.329> little

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
travelling the taper on this is a little

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.539 
travelling the taper on this is a little
bit<00:01:48.750> softer<00:01:48.960> it's<00:01:49.320> more<00:01:49.500> parabolic<00:01:50.159> which

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
bit softer it's more parabolic which

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.219 
bit softer it's more parabolic which
means<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:50.909> don't<00:01:51.060> tend<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.450> blow<00:01:51.720> rods<00:01:52.020> up

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
means you don't tend to blow rods up

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.200 
means you don't tend to blow rods up
when<00:01:52.710> they<00:01:52.860> get<00:01:53.040> bent<00:01:53.310> at<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.549> slightest
