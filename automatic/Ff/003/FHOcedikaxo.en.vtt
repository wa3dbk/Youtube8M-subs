00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
was easy to play with with confidence

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.789 
was easy to play with with confidence
when<00:01:11.700> your<00:01:12.689> best<00:01:12.900> players<00:01:13.140> leading<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.680> and

when your best players leading you and

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.140 
when your best players leading you and
playing<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.189> like<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.520> playing<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.119> game

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
exhaustion and that's what you need to

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.230 
exhaustion and that's what you need to
do<00:01:49.050> against<00:01:49.410> a<00:01:49.500> great<00:01:49.710> player<00:01:49.979> like<00:01:50.910> LeBron

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
do against a great player like LeBron

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.290

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
and you just have to make him work and

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.450 
and you just have to make him work and
even<00:01:54.600> then<00:01:54.780> he<00:01:55.350> make<00:01:55.530> them<00:01:55.680> work<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.100> make

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
them work and make them work and have to

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.190 
them work and make them work and have to
earn<00:01:58.500> everything<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.280> ends<00:01:59.520> up<00:01:59.640> with<00:02:00.200> 26

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
earn everything and ends up with 26

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.980 
earn everything and ends up with 26
still<00:02:01.729> now<00:02:02.729> so<00:02:02.970> that's<00:02:03.119> what<00:02:03.330> great<00:02:03.960> players

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
still now so that's what great players

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.760 
still now so that's what great players
do<00:02:04.470> but<00:02:04.800> our<00:02:05.900> perimeters<00:02:06.900> really<00:02:07.110> competed<00:02:07.680> on

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
do but our perimeters really competed on

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.560 
do but our perimeters really competed on
the<00:02:07.830> ball<00:02:08.100> so<00:02:08.429> our<00:02:08.729> bigs<00:02:09.000> didn't<00:02:09.330> have<00:02:09.420> to

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
the ball so our bigs didn't have to

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:11.390 
the ball so our bigs didn't have to
clean<00:02:09.899> up<00:02:09.929> as<00:02:10.200> much<00:02:10.350> as<00:02:10.530> they<00:02:10.649> typically<00:02:11.370> have

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
clean up as much as they typically have

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
only describe interesting sequence with

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.990 
only describe interesting sequence with
a<00:05:00.240> Chris<00:05:00.930> Andersen<00:05:01.410> guarding<00:05:02.100> LeBron<00:05:02.400> out<00:05:02.820> on

a Chris Andersen guarding LeBron out on

a Chris Andersen guarding LeBron out on
the<00:05:03.090> perimeter<00:05:03.210> and<00:05:03.720> then<00:05:04.140> kind<00:05:04.560> of

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
the perimeter and then kind of

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:05.840 
the perimeter and then kind of
contesting<00:05:05.190> the<00:05:05.250> shot<00:05:05.430> at<00:05:05.520> the<00:05:05.580> room<00:05:05.729> that

goes<00:05:05.970> the<00:05:06.090> other<00:05:06.150> way<00:05:06.360> I<00:05:06.390> think<00:05:06.600> he<00:05:06.720> dunks<00:05:07.080> it

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
goes the other way I think he dunks it

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.140 
goes the other way I think he dunks it
and<00:05:07.440> then<00:05:07.860> on<00:05:07.979> the<00:05:08.070> next<00:05:08.430> possession<00:05:08.940> pretty

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
and then on the next possession pretty

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.060 
and then on the next possession pretty
sure<00:05:09.240> he<00:05:09.360> takes<00:05:09.510> a<00:05:09.690> three<00:05:09.990> or<00:05:10.200> some<00:05:10.560> sequence

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
sure he takes a three or some sequence

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.880 
sure he takes a three or some sequence
of<00:05:11.370> that<00:05:11.669> in<00:05:11.880> that<00:05:12.330> order<00:05:12.570> so<00:05:13.020> what<00:05:13.680> goes

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:13.890 
of that in that order so what goes

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:15.080 
of that in that order so what goes
through<00:05:14.130> your<00:05:14.160> head<00:05:14.370> when<00:05:14.430> you<00:05:14.669> see<00:05:14.850> all<00:05:14.880> that
