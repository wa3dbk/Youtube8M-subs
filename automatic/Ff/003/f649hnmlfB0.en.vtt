00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
was a DLC I'm pretty sure over from

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.969 
was a DLC I'm pretty sure over from
morrowind<00:02:03.950> so<00:02:04.579> they're<00:02:05.390> not<00:02:05.539> like<00:02:05.860> super<00:02:06.860> high

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
morrowind so they're not like super high

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.190 
morrowind so they're not like super high
quality<00:02:07.009> weapons<00:02:07.939> or<00:02:08.300> anything<00:02:08.539> they<00:02:08.929> kind<00:02:09.170> of

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
quality weapons or anything they kind of

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.740 
quality weapons or anything they kind of
the<00:02:09.410> moorwen<00:02:09.739> feel<00:02:09.920> which<00:02:10.160> I<00:02:10.280> love<00:02:10.729> I<00:02:11.030> love<00:02:11.420> it

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
the moorwen feel which I love I love it

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:19.380 
the moorwen feel which I love I love it
truly<00:02:14.590> yeah<00:02:15.590> I<00:02:15.620> mean<00:02:15.830> this<00:02:16.819> is<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.480> claim<00:02:17.989> war

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
truly yeah I mean this is the claim war

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.000 
truly yeah I mean this is the claim war
looks<00:02:20.390> pretty<00:02:20.630> good<00:02:20.810> I<00:02:21.019> think

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
looks pretty good I think

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.229 
looks pretty good I think
it<00:02:22.220> definitely<00:02:22.580> looks<00:02:22.940> like<00:02:23.030> it's<00:02:23.180> from

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
it definitely looks like it's from

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.930 
it definitely looks like it's from
moorland<00:02:23.709> textures<00:02:24.709> are<00:02:24.890> maybe<00:02:25.489> a<00:02:25.670> little

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
moorland textures are maybe a little

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.970 
moorland textures are maybe a little
messed<00:02:26.090> up<00:02:26.239> I<00:02:26.569> think<00:02:27.380> the<00:02:27.440> guy<00:02:27.560> might<00:02:27.739> have<00:02:27.769> to

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
messed up I think the guy might have to

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.220 
messed up I think the guy might have to
fix<00:02:28.190> this<00:02:28.400> but<00:02:29.000> still<00:02:29.269> it's<00:02:29.540> a<00:02:29.660> claymore<00:02:30.019> looks

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
fix this but still it's a claymore looks

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.759 
fix this but still it's a claymore looks
really<00:02:30.440> nice<00:02:31.330> then<00:02:32.330> we<00:02:32.540> have<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:33.080> adamantium

morrowind<00:02:58.430> feel<00:02:58.720> definitely<00:02:59.720> like<00:03:00.079> the

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
morrowind feel definitely like the

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.420 
morrowind feel definitely like the
graphics<00:03:00.590> were<00:03:00.709> nothing<00:03:00.980> like<00:03:01.069> they<00:03:01.250> are<00:03:01.310> in

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
graphics were nothing like they are in

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.420 
graphics were nothing like they are in
Skyrim<00:03:01.790> so<00:03:02.060> it's<00:03:02.359> basically<00:03:02.690> like<00:03:03.069> this<00:03:04.069> looks

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
Skyrim so it's basically like this looks

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.550 
Skyrim so it's basically like this looks
really<00:03:05.000> bad<00:03:05.239> compared<00:03:05.780> to<00:03:05.840> the<00:03:06.019> Skyrim

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
really bad compared to the Skyrim

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.170 
really bad compared to the Skyrim

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
you would cut wood with maybe just a

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.280 
you would cut wood with maybe just a
little<00:03:23.959> better<00:03:24.350> of<00:03:24.530> a<00:03:24.590> design<00:03:25.480> more<00:03:26.480> of<00:03:26.569> a<00:03:26.660> war

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
little better of a design more of a war

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.430 
little better of a design more of a war
axe<00:03:27.530> ish<00:03:27.920> type<00:03:28.340> deal

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
axe ish type deal

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.460

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
it's really cool then you have the

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.060 
it's really cool then you have the
bipolar<00:03:34.950> blade<00:03:35.370> which<00:03:35.760> is<00:03:35.790> probably<00:03:37.040> one<00:03:38.040> of

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
bipolar blade which is probably one of

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.560
