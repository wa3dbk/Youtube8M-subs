let's<00:04:49.070> crank<00:04:49.250> up<00:04:49.460> your<00:04:49.520> own<00:04:49.820> back<00:04:50.300> onto<00:04:50.540> the

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
let's crank up your own back onto the

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:56.220 
let's crank up your own back onto the
thread<00:04:51.640> that's<00:04:52.640> all<00:04:52.820> going<00:04:52.970> to<00:04:53.060> walk<00:04:53.210> together

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.580 

so<00:04:57.230> then<00:04:57.860> you<00:04:58.010> have<00:04:58.420> spider<00:04:59.420> chain<00:05:00.050> rings<00:05:00.290> and

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
so then you have spider chain rings and

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:02.290 
so then you have spider chain rings and
crank<00:05:00.890> really<00:05:01.700> the<00:05:01.760> bolts<00:05:02.000> up<00:05:02.120> to<00:05:02.210> your

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
crank really the bolts up to your

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.810 
crank really the bolts up to your

Newton's apply to it to lock it off and

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
if you've got any C's so that'll be good

if you've got any C's so that'll be good
as<00:05:17.360> well<00:05:17.390> just<00:05:18.080> so<00:05:18.200> you<00:05:18.290> know<00:05:18.380> from<00:05:18.650> working

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
as well just so you know from working

movement<00:05:20.300> in<00:05:20.360> the<00:05:20.480> thread<00:05:20.980> and<00:05:21.980> then<00:05:22.130> it's

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
movement in the thread and then it's

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:44.179 
movement in the thread and then it's

specifically<00:05:48.489> this<00:05:50.429> spline<00:05:51.429> here<00:05:51.789> must<00:05:52.089> be

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:52.269 
specifically this spline here must be

00:05:52.269 --> 00:05:55.439 
specifically this spline here must be
treated<00:05:52.509> with<00:05:52.869> a<00:05:53.469> retaining<00:05:54.459> compound<00:05:55.029> to

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:55.449 
treated with a retaining compound to

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:58.709 
treated with a retaining compound to
fill<00:05:55.839> up<00:05:55.959> the<00:05:56.080> gap<00:05:56.319> between<00:05:57.189> the<00:05:58.089> spline<00:05:58.479> and

00:05:58.709 --> 00:05:58.719 
fill up the gap between the spline and

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:03.600 
fill up the gap between the spline and
thus<00:05:58.899> so<00:05:59.559> you<00:05:59.619> don't<00:05:59.769> get<00:05:59.889> in<00:06:00.039> creaking<00:06:00.459> so<00:06:02.610> put

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610 
thus so you don't get in creaking so put

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.989 
thus so you don't get in creaking so put
that<00:06:03.759> on<00:06:04.110> put<00:06:05.110> your<00:06:05.169> cranks<00:06:05.649> like<00:06:05.860> so<00:06:06.129> and<00:06:06.459> then

00:06:06.989 --> 00:06:06.999 
that on put your cranks like so and then

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:08.639 
that on put your cranks like so and then
your<00:06:07.239> thread<00:06:07.749> Locker<00:06:07.959> which<00:06:08.199> is<00:06:08.319> a<00:06:08.349> lower

there<00:06:15.369> talk<00:06:15.879> it<00:06:16.059> up<00:06:16.179> to<00:06:16.389> the<00:06:16.539> 35<00:06:17.110> to<00:06:17.349> 40<00:06:17.649> Newtons
