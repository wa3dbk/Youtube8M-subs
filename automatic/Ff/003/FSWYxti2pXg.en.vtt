00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.759
 yes, welcome to base game-tv outside 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.130
 it is nice and warm inside 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.810
 The Toni got a package 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.700
 I 've had it all before 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.189
 The whole thing is simply cut open 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.869
 to get a bill call these parts 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.320
 I did not get sponsored here 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.669
 as one is used to from me h 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.120
 but here I have myself winning 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:36.450
 this is packing material that 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.190
 we will remove and then in 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:44.160
 This video is about first 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:47.820
 this part here below discovered one 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.250
 or others already have a video card but 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:55.500
 that comes now only times we set aside 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:58.530
 first take care of the amd yes what 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:06.930
 it is for the one that is more 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:08.909
 the fx 83 20 and yes the packaging is 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.979
 become robust so you know that 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.679
 not the old processors of mine 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.229
 nice yes how should I say how close 

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:18.119
 nice stop ball and say had 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.469
 packaging and now we have 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.569
 to see everything nice in metal on the side 

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:30.060
 we already have to be sharp 

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:32.159
 moment here is the beautiful processor 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.810
 nice cdu i would say we do that 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.969
 things are just not on ne is not 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.810
 very big, but then he already starts 

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:40.020
 good at 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.359
 we'll just open this up and 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.789
 already see aha moment must nevertheless times 

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:46.529
 Off 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:48.599
 up here that's just pretty thick 

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:53.369
 But it's not like that because we have that 

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:54.929
 because we have a guide to 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.429
 processor rather nonsensical you will find 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:02:02.899
 but good we have the processor itself 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:05.039
 I'm careful now and broken 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.659
 if I'm careful now 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:11.009
 animal experiments take off 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.310
 there he is with sticker if I 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.620
 it of course here 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.480
 leave packed yes I'm just daring 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.890
 not just in front of the camera on the pins too 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.209
 So what should I do? 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.180
 but to keep it reasonable so that 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.430
 I just do not grab it and too good 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:31.400
 Of course, we have the last one as usual 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:35.330
 amd because if he comes out there is 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:42.610
 already and already it succumbs 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:44.810
 but I think so beautiful 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.730
 yes, what do we have here? 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.020
 most will be able to hear it 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:53.780
 that's right 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:59.570
 the fan for the cpu i just say to that 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:04.340
 the following ones unpack him once there 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:06.620
 is the good piece and asked him too 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.560
 directly again because without addition 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.150
 find fan I go to today 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.239
 Processors nothing more 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.370
 i will be at the noctua of the 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.079
 really nice but there can yes 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.720
 I put everyone on his own company 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:22.160
 grabbed next miner here you have 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.360
 you well have to otherwise purely I was 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:31.790
 the same that everyone must know yourself what 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:35.079
 but does so case is the processor 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.340
 is here can be installed 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:39.709
 instructions can peek again 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.900
 we are here again, for example 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.329
 whole different base-described 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.220
 that of course a 1 3 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:48.530
 Well , maybe you still maybe 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.019
 It would all be worth investing here 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:54.440
 eight cores 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:57.650
 he has eight cores he has to normal to 3.5 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.950
 ghz is clocked but without further notice 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:03.680
 makes several kernels still high ingredients 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:07.120
 he also automatically if required 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.829
 so it is a very nice part yes 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:15.859
 and in the end, do not let me 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:20.120
 I think I paid 160 euro 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:21.470
 or even 170 no idea so if 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.669
 one compares with intel one comes 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.000
 as always pretty good 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:27.440
 small interviewer and everything is clear 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 Get in the toni says goodbye 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.000
 forgive until next
