run<00:02:39.170> puckertucker<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.920> reason<00:02:40.220> for<00:02:40.340> that<00:02:40.400> is

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
run puckertucker the reason for that is

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.370 
run puckertucker the reason for that is
that<00:02:40.880> you<00:02:41.030> can<00:02:41.180> keep<00:02:41.420> both<00:02:41.720> thumbs<00:02:41.989> on<00:02:42.350> the

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.040 
that you can keep both thumbs on the
sticks<00:02:43.130> so<00:02:43.340> you<00:02:43.459> can<00:02:43.670> move<00:02:43.940> and<00:02:44.330> look<00:02:44.660> at<00:02:44.930> the

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
sticks so you can move and look at the

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.170 
sticks so you can move and look at the
same<00:02:45.260> time<00:02:45.500> so<00:02:46.040> for<00:02:46.130> example<00:02:46.519> if<00:02:46.610> I<00:02:46.730> had<00:02:46.880> jump

that and then jump just to get some

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.340 
that and then jump just to get some
extra<00:02:57.620> you<00:02:58.130> know<00:02:58.250> strafing<00:02:59.030> action<00:02:59.450> in<00:02:59.600> with

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
extra you know strafing action in with

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:01.840 
extra you know strafing action in with
the<00:03:00.500> new<00:03:00.650> controller<00:03:01.100> ideally<00:03:01.519> it's<00:03:01.670> going<00:03:01.790> to

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
the new controller ideally it's going to

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.250 
the new controller ideally it's going to
make<00:03:01.970> that<00:03:02.090> easier<00:03:02.540> to<00:03:02.690> do<00:03:02.870> for<00:03:03.110> all

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
make that easier to do for all

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.140 
make that easier to do for all
controller<00:03:03.709> setups<00:03:04.130> because<00:03:04.730> on<00:03:04.819> the<00:03:04.910> back

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
controller setups because on the back

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.840 
controller setups because on the back
it's<00:03:05.450> gonna<00:03:05.569> have<00:03:05.840> to<00:03:06.200> pour<00:03:07.070> extra<00:03:07.280> bumpers

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
it's gonna have to pour extra bumpers

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.840 
it's gonna have to pour extra bumpers
that<00:03:08.000> you<00:03:08.120> can<00:03:08.410> custom<00:03:09.410> preset<00:03:09.980> right<00:03:10.579> so<00:03:10.820> I

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
that you can custom preset right so I

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.610 
that you can custom preset right so I
could<00:03:11.150> have<00:03:11.299> any<00:03:11.570> schematic<00:03:12.200> I<00:03:12.320> can<00:03:12.470> have<00:03:12.590> a

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
could have any schematic I can have a

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.890 
could have any schematic I can have a
slide<00:03:12.980> and<00:03:13.250> destiny<00:03:13.790> on<00:03:14.090> the<00:03:14.239> back<00:03:14.420> so<00:03:14.780> I<00:03:14.810> could

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
slide and destiny on the back so I could

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.750 
slide and destiny on the back so I could
be<00:03:15.019> running<00:03:15.290> jumping<00:03:15.769> shooting<00:03:16.190> looking<00:03:16.549> and

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
be running jumping shooting looking and

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.099 
be running jumping shooting looking and
sliding<00:03:17.180> all<00:03:17.299> at<00:03:17.450> the<00:03:17.510> same<00:03:17.660> time<00:03:17.720> because

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
sliding all at the same time because

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:19.509 
sliding all at the same time because
that's<00:03:18.290> deadly<00:03:18.620> I<00:03:18.829> don't<00:03:19.070> know<00:03:19.160> if<00:03:19.250> I<00:03:19.310> want<00:03:19.459> to

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
that's deadly I don't know if I want to

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:20.860 
that's deadly I don't know if I want to
play<00:03:19.640> you<00:03:19.670> again<00:03:20.000> that's<00:03:20.239> the<00:03:20.480> whole<00:03:20.630> thing

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
play you again that's the whole thing

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
that's what it says so it's aiming for

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.479 
that's what it says so it's aiming for
that<00:03:22.400> high<00:03:22.700> eSports<00:03:23.359> like<00:03:23.930> top-tier<00:03:24.890> market

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
yes actually YouTube gaming do you know

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.319 
yes actually YouTube gaming do you know
anything<00:03:59.630> about<00:03:59.750> it<00:04:00.019> take<00:04:00.650> me<00:04:00.769> through<00:04:00.950> it

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
anything about it take me through it

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.090 
anything about it take me through it
so<00:04:02.329> I'm<00:04:02.450> no<00:04:02.569> expert<00:04:02.690> but<00:04:03.140> I<00:04:03.410> did<00:04:03.620> talk<00:04:03.739> to<00:04:03.799> a<00:04:03.950> guy

an expert so now I'm

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.110 
an expert so now I'm
a<00:04:08.060> semi-pro<00:04:08.690> let's<00:04:09.020> say<00:04:09.170> so<00:04:10.160> basically<00:04:10.640> he

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
a semi-pro let's say so basically he

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.720 
a semi-pro let's say so basically he
explained<00:04:11.750> that<00:04:12.340> let's<00:04:13.340> say<00:04:13.430> you<00:04:13.520> want<00:04:13.700> to

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
explained that let's say you want to

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.010 
explained that let's say you want to
filter<00:04:14.090> out<00:04:14.240> all<00:04:14.420> of<00:04:14.540> those<00:04:14.660> things<00:04:14.900> are

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.020 
filter out all of those things are

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.960 
filter out all of those things are
searching<00:04:15.319> for<00:04:15.500> four<00:04:15.740> games<00:04:15.890> right<00:04:16.220> so<00:04:16.489> let's

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
searching for four games right so let's

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.629 
searching for four games right so let's
say<00:04:17.090> I<00:04:17.150> only<00:04:17.389> want<00:04:17.540> to<00:04:17.750> see<00:04:17.930> Halo<00:04:18.440> 5<00:04:18.769> content<00:04:19.340> I

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
say I only want to see Halo 5 content I

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:22.000 
say I only want to see Halo 5 content I
go<00:04:20.120> into<00:04:20.239> the<00:04:20.389> search<00:04:20.600> engine<00:04:20.959> and<00:04:21.169> I<00:04:21.620> was

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
go into the search engine and I was

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:23.409 
go into the search engine and I was
thinking<00:04:22.430> why<00:04:22.580> don't<00:04:22.610> you<00:04:22.760> just<00:04:22.880> make<00:04:23.000> a<00:04:23.060> games

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
thinking why don't you just make a games

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:25.150 
thinking why don't you just make a games
index<00:04:23.990> so<00:04:24.260> I<00:04:24.320> just<00:04:24.500> played<00:04:24.650> games<00:04:24.860> install

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
index so I just played games install

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.280 
index so I just played games install
games<00:04:25.310> he<00:04:25.730> said<00:04:25.940> no<00:04:26.150> we<00:04:26.540> want<00:04:26.690> a<00:04:26.750> truly
