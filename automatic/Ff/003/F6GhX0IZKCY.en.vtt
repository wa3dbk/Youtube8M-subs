00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.990
 Mapper 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.659
 It looks like this and there is a hard disk in here 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:41.049
 Docs are fish 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:48.600
 You can attach a hard disk like this 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:48.600
 It's either me to cool comes with a fan behind it and looks like the person in 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.900
 To 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:57.630

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:58.650
 I What is the Zu' do I can is pretty big files take a video you want to see yourself and pretty 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.830
 It is heavy 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:07.290
 Since it was sequel troublesome smells and Dari what 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:10.590
 Here's a serious say ucb usb and sd card sd card part 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.920
 There automatically when interpolate Well digital camera sd card 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.120
 a disk 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.500
 As 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:20.080
 r Drive or Dribble auto copy folder is completed and it is s 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.760
 The character car is copied as it is 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:28.860
 So for example laptops such laptops 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:35.400
 It's possible to pull from a laptop on a well or windows and 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:39.180
 If using the Well early Fuck off press than Well to some extent priority and is the wireless lan 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:42.430
 It 's pretty easy to get the data out 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:46.060
 Well with usb 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.700
 It's almost the same as connecting, so I'm going there 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.569
 Because 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:54.930
 I this well towards you are basically a matter where the server 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.040
 Well the data in the way of return mackerel 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.090
 Preservation 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:03.080
 Save to some extent 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:08.300
 If you edit mac, approach data to this person once 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:14.360
 In that case , the data you have taken will be saved here so it should be 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:14.959
 If there is an upload error, I will immediately pull it from here to edit again 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.230
 Or 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.110
 I accidentally erased it in the stool soil whirlpool 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:24.040
 But 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:25.150
 It's okay here because it is here, so here is 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:31.689
 Oh dear 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:38.410
 As a recently used to have it in this guy functions as a backup is referred to in usb 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:41.250
 When the back usb say in there I'd like a two-port in a rear 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:48.760
 A and refer to either a printer 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:55.030
 Here and after that is connected to the wireless lan are connected by Well usb 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:56.430
 There is a function that you can use the printer from anywhere as a local area network 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:03.250
 I will 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:06.569
 So you don't have to bother with usb 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:11.790
 So here 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:16.410
 It was iTunes but it is automatically created as itunes server 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:20.109
 Well after I because you if the settings Well 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:23.110
 natt support bar na from the time of the enemy 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.930
 With Well if there is that natto function 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:32.460
 Well 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:37.380
 In this connected hit boo b a public and id and password 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:42.660
 It can be downloaded from outside in Buble for 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:44.950
 It depends on the round-trip broadband line of maa . 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:50.260
 It is normal if it is a light line well 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:54.480
 Becomes it also took videos was to Fu is about 1 hour and regardless of Zetton 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.480
 I will download it Yes 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:01.340
 So, for example, you can not sing a lot from the top of your laptop, for example, your mark 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:07.040
 Is it 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:10.260
 It 's difficult to put a song here and manage it with 128 if you don't feel it with mac 128 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:15.870
 Overwintering data here 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:19.350
 I tunes but let me read for those of itunes as there if they were here 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.950
 It is also possible to manage with, but I went to the windows of the cat 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.930
 I don't know 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.580
 That's right 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.790
 Hard but 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:29.169
 4 cars 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:32.160
 There is also a purpose to eliminate the shortage of capacity 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:34.400
 Well that's that 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:39.320
 Kenken day 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:44.470
 For example, parents can see this folder but children can not see this folder 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:51.390
 With that kind of feeling you can do some privacy 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:51.390
 You can also like that I if there are people to access it in multiple in the home 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:56.950
 Oh, it looks like this 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.910
 And it is what people of science 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.910
 Maybe it's a seedling time 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:11.080
 Well door Well I guess this is primarily a server and Iiii guy
