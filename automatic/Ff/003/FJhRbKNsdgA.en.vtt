do have a choice between comfort and

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.459 
do have a choice between comfort and
safety<00:00:11.389> but<00:00:12.389> ultimately<00:00:12.750> you<00:00:12.960> have<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.139> choose

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
safety but ultimately you have to choose

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:14.629 
safety but ultimately you have to choose
comfort<00:00:13.650> because<00:00:14.070> it's<00:00:14.370> all<00:00:14.490> about

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
comfort because it's all about

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.700 
comfort because it's all about
performance<00:00:14.880> what<00:00:15.839> about<00:00:15.929> kids<00:00:16.320> should<00:00:16.590> they

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
performance what about kids should they

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.050 
performance what about kids should they
have<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.859> choice<00:00:17.039> if<00:00:17.250> this<00:00:17.400> protection<00:00:17.789> that<00:00:18.000> I

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
have a choice if this protection that I

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.939 
have a choice if this protection that I
just<00:00:18.240> showed<00:00:18.300> you<00:00:18.480> is<00:00:18.600> this<00:00:18.810> uh<00:00:19.080> yeah<00:00:19.800> I<00:00:19.830> think

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
just showed you is this uh yeah I think

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.689 
just showed you is this uh yeah I think
so<00:00:20.220> I<00:00:20.400> mean<00:00:21.109> it<00:00:22.109> could<00:00:22.230> be<00:00:22.380> better<00:00:22.590> than<00:00:22.800> their

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
so I mean it could be better than their

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.550 
so I mean it could be better than their
parents<00:00:23.880> buying<00:00:24.300> them<00:00:24.539> in<00:00:25.109> other<00:00:25.260> rights

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
you know like I said it's not a bad idea

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.219

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
probably didn't like wearing a neck

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.260 
probably didn't like wearing a neck
guard<00:02:16.980> as<00:02:17.130> a<00:02:17.160> kid<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:17.430> don't<00:02:17.610> think<00:02:17.850> any<00:02:17.970> kids

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
guard as a kid I don't think any kids

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.870 
guard as a kid I don't think any kids
like<00:02:18.630> wearing<00:02:18.990> it<00:02:19.110> it's<00:02:19.320> not<00:02:19.470> comfortable<00:02:19.880> but

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
like wearing it it's not comfortable but

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.790 
like wearing it it's not comfortable but
at<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.060> same<00:02:21.210> time<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:22.140> idea<00:02:22.380> is<00:02:22.410> to<00:02:22.560> protect

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
at the same time the idea is to protect

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.580 
at the same time the idea is to protect
them<00:02:22.980> right<00:02:23.190> so<00:02:23.430> same<00:02:23.730> sort<00:02:24.000> of<00:02:24.060> thing<00:02:24.590> you

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
them right so same sort of thing you

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.949 
them right so same sort of thing you
know<00:02:25.620> we<00:02:25.950> all<00:02:26.100> we<00:02:26.550> all<00:02:26.580> can't<00:02:27.000> wait<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.450> take

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
know we all we all can't wait to take

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.930 
know we all we all can't wait to take
them<00:02:28.110> off<00:02:28.230> but<00:02:28.590> you<00:02:28.980> know<00:02:29.459> if<00:02:29.550> there<00:02:29.730> was<00:02:29.790> an

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
them off but you know if there was an

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.390 
them off but you know if there was an
injury<00:02:30.209> to<00:02:30.360> our<00:02:30.420> necks<00:02:30.890> we<00:02:31.890> probably<00:02:32.130> the

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
injury to our necks we probably the

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.729 
injury to our necks we probably the
first<00:02:32.550> one<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:32.790> put<00:02:32.970> it<00:02:33.090> back<00:02:33.180> on<00:02:33.390> so<00:02:33.750> no<00:02:34.590> it's

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
first one to put it back on so no it's

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.460 
first one to put it back on so no it's
definitely<00:02:34.980> a<00:02:35.690> really<00:02:36.690> good<00:02:36.810> idea<00:02:36.930> for<00:02:37.290> kids

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
definitely a really good idea for kids

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.199 
definitely a really good idea for kids
to<00:02:37.620> wear<00:02:37.739> night<00:02:37.920> guards<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.430> I<00:02:38.790> know<00:02:39.060> it's

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
to wear night guards and I know it's

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:40.699 
to wear night guards and I know it's
probably<00:02:39.390> not<00:02:39.630> a<00:02:39.660> bad<00:02:39.750> idea<00:02:39.900> for<00:02:40.200> us<00:02:40.380> to<00:02:40.440> him

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
probably not a bad idea for us to him

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.360 
probably not a bad idea for us to him
too<00:02:41.239> thanks<00:02:42.239> right
