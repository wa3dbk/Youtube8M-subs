all right the next step that I'm going
to<00:00:01.439> take<00:00:01.620> is<00:00:01.909> I'm<00:00:02.909> actually<00:00:03.060> going<00:00:03.360> to<00:00:03.419> install

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
to take is I'm actually going to install

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.639 
to take is I'm actually going to install
this<00:00:04.620> new<00:00:05.390> ignition<00:00:06.390> lock<00:00:06.569> cylinder<00:00:07.080> that<00:00:07.529> I

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
this new ignition lock cylinder that I

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.190 
this new ignition lock cylinder that I
got<00:00:08.120> into<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.269> upper<00:00:09.480> part<00:00:09.719> of<00:00:09.750> the<00:00:09.840> housing

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
got into the upper part of the housing

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.890 
got into the upper part of the housing
and<00:00:10.349> it's<00:00:11.190> really<00:00:11.400> just<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.940> reverse<00:00:12.599> of

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
and it's really just the reverse of

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.279 
and it's really just the reverse of
removal<00:00:13.559> as<00:00:14.160> most<00:00:14.969> of<00:00:15.059> this<00:00:15.120> stuff<00:00:15.360> is<00:00:15.509> I'll

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
removal as most of this stuff is I'll

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.490 
removal as most of this stuff is I'll
show<00:00:16.350> you<00:00:16.560> this<00:00:16.710> right<00:00:16.949> here<00:00:18.170> this<00:00:19.170> little<00:00:20.060> nub

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
show you this right here this little nub

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.750 
show you this right here this little nub
you<00:00:22.500> kind<00:00:22.680> of<00:00:22.740> can<00:00:23.130> think<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.400> it<00:00:23.490> as<00:00:23.519> like<00:00:23.730> a

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
you kind of can think of it as like a

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.759 
you kind of can think of it as like a
key<00:00:24.119> way<00:00:24.439> okay<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.650> this<00:00:26.220> is<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.550> key<00:00:26.760> and

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:27.769 
key way okay and this is the key and

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.970 
key way okay and this is the key and
then<00:00:28.769> in<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:30.000> housing<00:00:30.810> part<00:00:31.080> we<00:00:31.800> have<00:00:31.949> a

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
then in the housing part we have a

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.870 
then in the housing part we have a
little<00:00:33.890> this<00:00:34.890> is<00:00:35.040> actually<00:00:35.340> like<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.579> key<00:00:35.760> way

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
little this is actually like the key way

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.709 
little this is actually like the key way
it's<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.090> little<00:00:36.180> notch<00:00:36.450> so<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.410> little<00:00:38.190> notch

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 
it's a little notch so that little notch

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:45.500 
it's a little notch so that little notch
goes<00:00:39.719> in<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.960> lower<00:00:40.140> part<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:42.379> the<00:00:44.360> of<00:00:45.360> the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
goes in the lower part of the of the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.610 
goes in the lower part of the of the
cylinder<00:00:46.129> okay<00:00:47.129> just<00:00:47.340> like<00:00:47.489> removing<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.620> this

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
cylinder okay just like removing it this

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.069 
cylinder okay just like removing it this
little<00:00:49.890> plunger<00:00:50.309> here<00:00:50.670> is<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.780> key<00:00:51.960> to

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
little plunger here is the key to

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.810 
little plunger here is the key to
getting<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.320> back<00:00:52.469> in<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.980> I've<00:00:53.489> got<00:00:53.699> the

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
getting it back in and I've got the

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.150 
getting it back in and I've got the
steering<00:00:54.120> I've<00:00:54.300> got<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.570> key<00:00:54.809> in<00:00:55.110> all<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.039> way

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
steering I've got the key in all the way

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.299 
steering I've got the key in all the way
on<00:00:56.340> position<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.090> that's<00:00:57.859> really<00:00:58.859> this<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.160> the

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
on position so that's really this is the

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.709 
on position so that's really this is the
orientation<00:00:59.609> that's<00:01:00.000> like<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.300> start

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
orientation that's like the start

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.389 
orientation that's like the start
position<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.620> then<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:01.890> would<00:01:02.010> come<00:01:02.160> back<00:01:02.340> to

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
position and then it would come back to

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.030 
position and then it would come back to
ignition<00:01:02.850> on<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:04.170> that's<00:01:04.290> basically<00:01:04.890> the

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
ignition on so that's basically the

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.609 
ignition on so that's basically the
start<00:01:05.280> position<00:01:06.020> stick<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.110> in<00:01:07.200> like<00:01:07.229> that

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.740 

make<00:01:10.619> sure<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:10.799> your<00:01:11.100> little<00:01:11.340> pull<00:01:12.210> tab<00:01:12.420> this

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
make sure that your little pull tab this

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.590 
make sure that your little pull tab this
pulls<00:01:12.990> on<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.290> rod<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:14.070> engages<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.299> actual

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
pulls on the rod that engages the actual

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.719 
pulls on the rod that engages the actual
ignition<00:01:16.020> switch<00:01:16.280> go<00:01:17.280> ahead<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.549> pull<00:01:17.700> that

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
ignition switch go ahead and pull that

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.350 
ignition switch go ahead and pull that
out<00:01:17.909> all<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.299> way<00:01:18.420> because<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.049> got<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.590> little

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
out all the way because you got a little

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.450 
out all the way because you got a little
gear<00:01:21.360> in<00:01:21.540> here<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.350> on<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.860> end<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.220> gear

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
gear in here and on the end of that gear

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.789 
gear in here and on the end of that gear
it's<00:01:23.700> got<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:23.970> mesh<00:01:24.920> with<00:01:26.119> that<00:01:27.119> right<00:01:27.360> there

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
it's got to mesh with that right there

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.560 
it's got to mesh with that right there
so<00:01:28.799> we've<00:01:29.610> got<00:01:29.729> everything<00:01:30.060> pulled<00:01:30.299> out<00:01:30.450> all

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
so we've got everything pulled out all

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.980 
so we've got everything pulled out all
the<00:01:30.600> way<00:01:31.939> go<00:01:32.939> ahead<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.299> stick<00:01:35.689> our<00:01:36.689> lock

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
the way go ahead and stick our lock

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.170 
the way go ahead and stick our lock
cylinder<00:01:37.409> in<00:01:37.530> place<00:01:37.740> this<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.640> where<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.060> gets

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
cylinder in place this is where it gets

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.319 
cylinder in place this is where it gets
kind<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.570> tricky<00:01:40.520> you<00:01:41.520> get<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.759> get<00:01:41.909> in<00:01:42.060> there

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
kind of tricky you get it get in there

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:50.990 
kind of tricky you get it get in there
and<00:01:43.970> depress<00:01:45.500> that<00:01:46.500> little<00:01:46.770> tab<00:01:47.040> again<00:01:49.850> to<00:01:50.850> get

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
and depress that little tab again to get

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.540 
and depress that little tab again to get
it<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.149> fall<00:01:51.450> into<00:01:51.689> place

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:04.880 

they're<00:01:57.550> just<00:02:00.630> run<00:02:01.630> it<00:02:01.750> in<00:02:01.870> even<00:02:02.140> further<00:02:02.910> and

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
they're just run it in even further and

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.919 
they're just run it in even further and
then<00:02:05.890> check<00:02:07.830> check<00:02:08.830> the<00:02:08.950> alignment<00:02:09.250> here<00:02:09.700> on

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
then check check the alignment here on

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.460 
then check check the alignment here on
where<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:12.370> lock<00:02:12.610> cylinder<00:02:12.850> is<00:02:13.240> up<00:02:13.960> in<00:02:14.170> there<00:02:14.290> I

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
where the lock cylinder is up in there I

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.980 
where the lock cylinder is up in there I
know<00:02:14.760> I'm<00:02:15.760> not<00:02:15.940> getting<00:02:16.150> it<00:02:16.330> in<00:02:16.420> film<00:02:16.780> very

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
know I'm not getting it in film very

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.540 
know I'm not getting it in film very
good<00:02:17.260> or<00:02:17.980> on<00:02:18.130> camera<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.950> end<00:02:21.130> of<00:02:21.220> it<00:02:21.310> they're

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
good or on camera the end of it they're

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:22.949 
good or on camera the end of it they're
lines<00:02:22.030> up<00:02:22.240> with<00:02:22.360> the<00:02:22.480> end<00:02:22.600> of<00:02:22.720> the<00:02:22.780> lock

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
lines up with the end of the lock

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.050 
lines up with the end of the lock
cylinder<00:02:23.440> so<00:02:24.010> I<00:02:24.040> actually<00:02:24.220> need<00:02:24.490> to<00:02:24.520> push<00:02:24.850> this

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
cylinder so I actually need to push this

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.050 
cylinder so I actually need to push this
in<00:02:25.830> just<00:02:26.830> a<00:02:26.980> little<00:02:27.010> bit<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:30.010> I<00:02:30.100> could<00:02:30.280> shove

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
in just a little bit and I could shove

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:39.449 
in just a little bit and I could shove
my<00:02:31.209> lock<00:02:31.420> cylinder<00:02:31.870> in<00:02:35.940> there<00:02:36.940> it<00:02:37.060> goes<00:02:38.459> just

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
my lock cylinder in there it goes just

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.580 
my lock cylinder in there it goes just
like<00:02:39.580> that<00:02:39.780> all<00:02:40.780> right<00:02:40.930> so<00:02:41.080> we<00:02:41.200> got<00:02:41.320> the<00:02:41.410> lock

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
like that all right so we got the lock

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.820 
like that all right so we got the lock
cylinder<00:02:41.860> fully<00:02:42.550> installed<00:02:43.650> everything<00:02:44.650> is

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
cylinder fully installed everything is

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.449 
cylinder fully installed everything is
in<00:02:44.980> a<00:02:45.390> working<00:02:46.390> condition<00:02:47.160> you<00:02:48.160> see<00:02:48.340> this

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
in a working condition you see this

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.210 
in a working condition you see this
pushes<00:02:48.910> out<00:02:49.620> that's<00:02:50.620> in<00:02:50.770> the<00:02:50.830> start<00:02:51.070> position

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
pushes out that's in the start position

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.820 
pushes out that's in the start position
that<00:02:51.940> would<00:02:52.060> be<00:02:52.180> about<00:02:52.420> run<00:02:53.110> position<00:02:53.470> and

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
that would be about run position and

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.410 
that would be about run position and
then<00:02:53.950> of<00:02:54.910> course<00:02:54.940> off<00:02:55.390> and<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:57.190> key<00:02:57.430> on<00:02:57.700> line

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
then of course off and the key on line

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.199 
then of course off and the key on line
the<00:02:58.660> key<00:02:58.840> is<00:02:59.019> a<00:02:59.260> little<00:02:59.860> bit<00:02:59.980> sticky<00:03:00.400> so<00:03:00.580> I

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
the key is a little bit sticky so I

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:02.520 
the key is a little bit sticky so I
think<00:03:01.600> that's<00:03:01.780> just<00:03:01.900> going<00:03:01.989> to<00:03:02.110> have<00:03:02.230> to<00:03:02.290> come

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
think that's just going to have to come

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.650 
think that's just going to have to come
with<00:03:02.709> with<00:03:03.610> use<00:03:03.910> but<00:03:06.030> it<00:03:07.030> does<00:03:07.209> come<00:03:07.390> out<00:03:07.540> and

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
with with use but it does come out and

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.810 
with with use but it does come out and
does<00:03:07.810> work<00:03:07.959> so<00:03:08.230> next<00:03:09.100> up<00:03:09.220> we<00:03:09.310> got<00:03:09.340> to<00:03:09.459> do<00:03:09.610> is<00:03:09.790> a

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
does work so next up we got to do is a

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.230 
does work so next up we got to do is a
put<00:03:10.450> the<00:03:10.510> steering<00:03:10.690> shaft<00:03:10.810> in
