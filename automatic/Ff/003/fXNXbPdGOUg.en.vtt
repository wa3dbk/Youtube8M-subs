00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
old one was mounted here on the side

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.010 
old one was mounted here on the side
yeah<00:01:40.549> the<00:01:41.549> wiring<00:01:42.000> on<00:01:42.119> this<00:01:42.240> was<00:01:42.420> too<00:01:42.630> short

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
yeah the wiring on this was too short

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.149 
yeah the wiring on this was too short
for<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.290> stem<00:01:43.590> card<00:01:44.090> here<00:01:45.090> for<00:01:45.920> these<00:01:46.920> wires

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
for the stem card here for these wires

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.770 
for the stem card here for these wires
to<00:01:47.430> reach<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.909> side<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.299> secure<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.750> properly

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
to reach the side and secure it properly

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.289 
to reach the side and secure it properly
so<00:01:49.560> if<00:01:49.680> that<00:01:49.829> did<00:01:50.040> take<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.250> footstool<00:01:50.850> off<00:01:51.119> of
