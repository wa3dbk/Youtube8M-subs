the drone will sorry the probe will
actually<00:00:47.100> interfere<00:00:47.489> with<00:00:47.579> this<00:00:47.670> expansion

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
actually interfere with this expansion

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.569 
actually interfere with this expansion
when<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.300> comes<00:00:48.450> out<00:00:48.570> looks<00:00:49.230> like<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.620> infernal

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
when it comes out looks like a infernal

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.459 
when it comes out looks like a infernal
Cecil<00:00:50.910> doesn't<00:00:51.480> turn<00:00:51.660> around<00:00:51.989> though<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:52.199> it

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
Cecil doesn't turn around though so it

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.319 
Cecil doesn't turn around though so it
doesn't<00:00:52.710> bother<00:00:52.800> actually<00:00:53.280> interfering<00:00:54.239> with

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
doesn't bother actually interfering with

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.209 
doesn't bother actually interfering with
it<00:00:54.539> as<00:00:54.719> he<00:00:54.870> did<00:00:55.020> at<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.289> previous<00:00:55.590> game<00:00:55.680> well

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
it as he did at the previous game well

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.110 
it as he did at the previous game well
not<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.430> previous<00:00:56.670> game<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.850> game<00:00:56.940> before

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
not the previous game the game before

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.110 
not the previous game the game before
that<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.629> think<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.199> was<00:00:58.289> game<00:00:58.469> Game<00:00:59.370> three<00:01:00.000> or

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
that I think it was game Game three or

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.700 
that I think it was game Game three or
four<00:01:00.300> where<00:01:00.870> he<00:01:00.960> actually<00:01:01.079> went<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.469> blocked

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
four where he actually went and blocked

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.200 
four where he actually went and blocked
the<00:01:01.829> hatchery<00:01:02.309> completely<00:01:02.760> which<00:01:02.910> is<00:01:03.030> cool

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
the hatchery completely which is cool

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.050 
the hatchery completely which is cool
he's<00:01:03.809> going<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.049> he's<00:01:04.199> going<00:01:04.409> for<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.710> fuss<00:01:05.339> a

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
he's going to he's going for a fuss a

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.810 
he's going to he's going for a fuss a
gas<00:01:06.450> so<00:01:06.960> looks<00:01:07.770> like<00:01:07.799> he<00:01:07.950> might<00:01:08.040> be<00:01:08.100> trying<00:01:08.580> but

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
gas so looks like he might be trying but

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.580 
gas so looks like he might be trying but

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
more of a tech build this time we

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.960 
more of a tech build this time we
introduced<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.130> down<00:01:11.369> so<00:01:11.580> you've<00:01:11.670> turned<00:01:11.790> out

tried that in the first game and it

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.490 
tried that in the first game and it
didn't<00:02:30.300> quite<00:02:30.360> work<00:02:30.450> out<00:02:30.750> for<00:02:30.930> him<00:02:30.990> already

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
didn't quite work out for him already

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.990 
didn't quite work out for him already
had<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:31.800> do<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:32.070> stop<00:02:32.340> that<00:02:32.370> was<00:02:33.210> too<00:02:33.540> afraid<00:02:34.050> a

had to do to stop that was too afraid a

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.130 
had to do to stop that was too afraid a
over<00:02:36.000> C<00:02:36.150> which<00:02:36.300> shouldn't<00:02:36.540> take<00:02:36.600> long<00:02:36.900> and

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
over C which shouldn't take long and

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.600 
over C which shouldn't take long and
then<00:02:37.410> just<00:02:37.620> crush<00:02:37.920> everything<00:02:38.190> with<00:02:38.400> roaches

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
then just crush everything with roaches

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.000 
then just crush everything with roaches
as<00:02:39.330> you<00:02:39.480> normally<00:02:39.600> would<00:02:39.810> hatchery<00:02:40.620> being

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
upgraded now haven't seen the roach one

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.400 
upgraded now haven't seen the roach one

right<00:04:40.840> okay<00:04:41.200> so<00:04:41.260> not<00:04:41.590> going<00:04:41.830> for<00:04:41.980> dark

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
right okay so not going for dark

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.700 
right okay so not going for dark
templars<00:04:42.490> after<00:04:42.730> all<00:04:43.110> almost<00:04:44.110> forget<00:04:44.410> that<00:04:44.590> in

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
templars after all almost forget that in

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.280 
templars after all almost forget that in
this<00:04:44.800> game<00:04:45.070> dark<00:04:45.850> templars<00:04:46.300> if<00:04:46.660> you<00:04:46.780> mix<00:04:47.140> two

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
this game dark templars if you mix two

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.540 
this game dark templars if you mix two
of<00:04:47.350> them<00:04:47.440> together<00:04:47.590> they<00:04:47.860> can<00:04:48.070> be<00:04:48.190> produced<00:04:48.400> in

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
of them together they can be produced in

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.910 
of them together they can be produced in
an<00:04:48.700> icon<00:04:49.240> so<00:04:49.480> at<00:04:49.990> least<00:04:50.140> that's<00:04:50.380> how<00:04:50.470> i<00:04:50.710> think

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:50.920 
an icon so at least that's how i think

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.310 
an icon so at least that's how i think
it<00:04:51.010> works<00:04:51.160> nowadays<00:04:51.370> so<00:04:51.730> his<00:04:52.330> decision<00:04:53.170> at<00:04:53.260> the

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
it works nowadays so his decision at the

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.810 
it works nowadays so his decision at the
end<00:04:53.350> of<00:04:53.500> the<00:04:53.560> game<00:04:53.590> here<00:04:53.980> from<00:04:54.160> infernal<00:04:54.640> was

this<00:05:20.230> could<00:05:20.440> be<00:05:20.470> deciding<00:05:20.920> game<00:05:21.100> but<00:05:21.820> it<00:05:22.030> could

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
this could be deciding game but it could

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.510 
this could be deciding game but it could
take<00:05:22.240> us<00:05:22.450> to<00:05:22.540> game<00:05:22.720> game<00:05:23.380> 7<00:05:23.860> and<00:05:24.010> if<00:05:24.340> that

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
take us to game game 7 and if that

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.920 
take us to game game 7 and if that
happens<00:05:24.640> maybe<00:05:25.060> we'll<00:05:25.360> see<00:05:25.480> a<00:05:25.510> repeat<00:05:25.750> of<00:05:25.810> the

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
happens maybe we'll see a repeat of the

happens maybe we'll see a repeat of the

in<00:05:33.040> maybe<00:05:33.280> he'll<00:05:33.460> wait<00:05:33.610> for<00:05:33.640> more<00:05:34.000> more<00:05:34.270> guys

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:34.419 
in maybe he'll wait for more more guys

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:36.150

if<00:05:34.540> he's<00:05:34.660> got<00:05:34.780> more<00:05:34.960> roaches<00:05:35.110> on<00:05:35.350> the<00:05:35.440> way<00:05:35.560> just

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
if he's got more roaches on the way just

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.290 
if he's got more roaches on the way just
wants<00:05:36.340> to<00:05:36.400> make<00:05:36.460> sure<00:05:36.550> absolutely<00:05:36.820> sure<00:05:37.090> he's

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:38.980 
got enough to deal with this maybe even

just a little bit just um just to make
sure<00:05:53.730> it's<00:05:53.910> got<00:05:54.150> the<00:05:54.210> right<00:05:54.390> concave<00:05:54.810> and<00:05:54.930> so

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
sure it's got the right concave and so

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.310 
sure it's got the right concave and so
forth<00:05:55.320> but<00:05:55.560> it<00:05:56.100> looks<00:05:56.580> to<00:05:56.700> be<00:05:56.910> a<00:05:57.180> real<00:05:57.840> let<00:05:58.290> down

I'm not sure if he's tried this the

I'm not sure if he's tried this the
