with them also we were back at romans I

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.620 
with them also we were back at romans I
on<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.350> steel<00:01:31.650> mill<00:01:31.680> as<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.549> can<00:01:32.700> see<00:01:32.970> here<00:01:33.479> at

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
on a steel mill as you can see here at

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.850 
on a steel mill as you can see here at
least<00:01:33.780> that's<00:01:33.930> what<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.079> looks<00:01:34.439> like<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.680> me

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
least that's what it looks like to me

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.560 
least that's what it looks like to me
not<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.159> hundred<00:01:35.369> percent<00:01:35.490> sure<00:01:35.729> we<00:01:36.240> also<00:01:36.360> got

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
not a hundred percent sure we also got

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.450 
not a hundred percent sure we also got
like<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.900> Chinese<00:01:37.140> lanterns<00:01:37.799> up<00:01:37.950> there<00:01:38.189> so<00:01:38.369> it

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
like the Chinese lanterns up there so it

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.429 
like the Chinese lanterns up there so it
still<00:01:38.640> looks<00:01:38.790> like<00:01:38.850> Chinatown<00:01:39.479> but<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:40.170> looks

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
still looks like Chinatown but it looks

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.520 
still looks like Chinatown but it looks
like<00:01:40.500> this<00:01:40.850> sionis<00:01:41.850> steel<00:01:42.060> mill<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.420> me<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:43.229> not

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
like this sionis steel mill to me so not

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.020 
like this sionis steel mill to me so not
hundreds<00:01:43.890> in<00:01:43.979> sure<00:01:44.220> but<00:01:44.460> if<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.939> would

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
hundreds in sure but if it is it would

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.700 
hundreds in sure but if it is it would
make<00:01:45.180> sense<00:01:45.210> for<00:01:45.600> him<00:01:45.720> taking<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.259> back<00:01:46.439> from

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
make sense for him taking it back from

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.380 
make sense for him taking it back from
Joker<00:01:47.070> since<00:01:47.250> Joker<00:01:47.520> had<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.820> in<00:01:47.939> Arkham<00:01:48.210> City

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
Joker since Joker had it in Arkham City

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.510 
Joker since Joker had it in Arkham City
and<00:01:48.689> here<00:01:49.170> we<00:01:49.290> could<00:01:49.439> see<00:01:49.619> more<00:01:49.799> fighting<00:01:50.310> and

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
and here we could see more fighting and

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.740 
and here we could see more fighting and
yet<00:01:51.390> just<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:52.140> looks<00:01:52.560> pretty<00:01:53.040> cool<00:01:53.430> but<00:01:54.420> yeah

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
yet just it looks pretty cool but yeah

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.810

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
like I was saying I wish he would just

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.929 
like I was saying I wish he would just
use<00:01:57.149> his<00:01:57.329> fists<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:58.079> do<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.680> doesn't<00:01:59.310> make<00:01:59.520> like

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
use his fists I do it doesn't make like

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.969 
use his fists I do it doesn't make like

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
it looks kind of stupid for him to be

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.709 
it looks kind of stupid for him to be
using<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:02.490> but<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.820> trailer<00:02:03.090> was<00:02:03.299> really

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719

worries me a bit i wish it was because
this<00:02:18.930> looks<00:02:19.110> like<00:02:19.290> it's<00:02:19.440> just<00:02:19.500> going<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.740> take

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
this looks like it's just going to take

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.560 
this looks like it's just going to take
place<00:02:20.070> a<00:02:20.190> small<00:02:20.460> little<00:02:20.700> section<00:02:21.240> and<00:02:21.360> that's

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
place a small little section and that's

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.600 
place a small little section and that's
it<00:02:21.810> I<00:02:22.020> don't<00:02:22.620> think<00:02:22.860> he'll<00:02:23.010> become<00:02:23.130> free<00:02:23.430> roam

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
it I don't think he'll become free roam

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.670 
it I don't think he'll become free roam
like<00:02:23.760> after<00:02:24.330> that<00:02:24.360> maybe<00:02:24.870> it<00:02:25.110> could<00:02:25.290> be<00:02:25.470> hey

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
like after that maybe it could be hey

that<00:02:29.670> would<00:02:29.790> be<00:02:29.880> cool<00:02:30.090> but<00:02:30.120> I<00:02:30.330> doubt<00:02:30.510> that's

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
that would be cool but I doubt that's

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.840 
that would be cool but I doubt that's
the<00:02:30.900> case<00:02:31.080> either<00:02:31.770> way<00:02:31.980> I'm<00:02:32.070> not<00:02:32.220> too<00:02:32.460> worried

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
the case either way I'm not too worried

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.940 
the case either way I'm not too worried
because<00:02:33.030> mr.<00:02:33.510> jag<00:02:33.720> was<00:02:33.930> saying<00:02:34.170> once<00:02:34.620> he<00:02:34.740> beats

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
because mr. jag was saying once he beats

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.320 
because mr. jag was saying once he beats

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
wait for that if they aren't free roam

the characters in our free roam free
roam<00:02:45.330> and<00:02:45.540> so<00:02:45.660> that's<00:02:45.840> pretty<00:02:46.260> cool<00:02:46.560> but<00:02:47.000> at

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
roam and so that's pretty cool but at

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.310 
roam and so that's pretty cool but at
the<00:02:48.120> same<00:02:48.300> time<00:02:48.480> I<00:02:48.540> wish<00:02:48.720> it<00:02:48.930> was<00:02:49.020> free<00:02:49.170> roam

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
the same time I wish it was free roam

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.900 
the same time I wish it was free roam

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:51.980 
across all platforms like I wish they
