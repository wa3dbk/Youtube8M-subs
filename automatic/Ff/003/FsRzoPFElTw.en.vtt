00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
tool and you run it along the same hole

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.110 
tool and you run it along the same hole
lines<00:02:23.920> otherwise<00:02:24.430> it<00:02:24.640> messes<00:02:24.970> up<00:02:25.060> your

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
lines otherwise it messes up your

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.809 
lines otherwise it messes up your
pattern<00:02:25.540> a<00:02:25.600> little<00:02:25.840> bit<00:02:26.190> okay<00:02:27.190> so<00:02:27.220> that's<00:02:27.640> the

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
pattern a little bit okay so that's the

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.270 
pattern a little bit okay so that's the
effect<00:02:27.880> that<00:02:28.209> it's<00:02:28.420> going<00:02:28.630> to<00:02:28.690> give<00:02:28.870> you<00:02:29.050> a

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
effect that it's going to give you a

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.250 
effect that it's going to give you a

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
and we're going to do one row of

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.750 
and we're going to do one row of
diamonds<00:02:56.880> okay<00:02:57.880> all<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:58.540> way<00:02:58.569> along<00:02:59.049> with<00:02:59.760> the

diamonds okay all the way along with the
sponging<00:03:01.570> and<00:03:01.780> then<00:03:02.680> jump<00:03:03.010> over<00:03:03.190> to<00:03:04.200> two

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
sponging and then jump over to two

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.080 
sponging and then jump over to two
diamonds<00:03:06.180> but<00:03:07.180> do<00:03:07.450> this<00:03:07.660> in<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:07.989> opposite

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
diamonds but do this in the opposite

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.009 
diamonds but do this in the opposite
diamonds<00:03:10.090> and<00:03:10.239> that<00:03:10.360> will<00:03:10.480> give<00:03:10.690> you<00:03:10.840> that
