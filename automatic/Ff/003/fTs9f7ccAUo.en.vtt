00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
okay so I was on looking at them at

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.800 
okay so I was on looking at them at
snake<00:00:04.440> and<00:00:04.589> I<00:00:04.620> wanted<00:00:04.859> to<00:00:04.980> know<00:00:05.130> how<00:00:05.750> would<00:00:06.750> I

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
snake and I wanted to know how would I

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.450 
snake and I wanted to know how would I
be<00:00:07.109> able<00:00:07.200> to<00:00:07.350> do<00:00:07.470> something<00:00:07.890> like<00:00:08.040> this<00:00:08.220> in

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
be able to do something like this in

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.009 
be able to do something like this in
ZBrush<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:08.880> I<00:00:09.059> think<00:00:09.300> I<00:00:09.420> figured<00:00:09.630> it<00:00:09.750> out

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
ZBrush and I think I figured it out

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.830 
ZBrush and I think I figured it out
although<00:00:10.950> I'm<00:00:11.550> hoping<00:00:12.120> that<00:00:12.330> some<00:00:12.570> of<00:00:12.690> you

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
although I'm hoping that some of you

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.519 
although I'm hoping that some of you
ZBrush<00:00:13.349> some<00:00:13.500> gurus<00:00:13.860> might<00:00:14.130> be<00:00:14.309> able<00:00:14.460> to<00:00:15.529> well

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
ZBrush some gurus might be able to well

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.359 
ZBrush some gurus might be able to well
tell<00:00:17.130> me<00:00:17.250> if<00:00:17.340> I'm<00:00:17.460> doing<00:00:17.789> this<00:00:17.910> right<00:00:19.369> so

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
tell me if I'm doing this right so

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.609 
tell me if I'm doing this right so
here's<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.420> snake<00:00:21.720> ma<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:22.140> need<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:23.930> get<00:00:24.930> it's<00:00:25.500> a

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
here's a snake ma I need and get it's a

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.160 
here's a snake ma I need and get it's a
solid<00:00:26.070> piece<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:28.760> exported<00:00:29.760> it<00:00:29.939> out<00:00:30.119> as<00:00:30.449> an<00:00:30.599> obj

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
solid piece I exported it out as an obj

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:40.720 
solid piece I exported it out as an obj
and<00:00:31.380> I'm<00:00:32.279> going<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.550> bring<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.790> into<00:00:32.910> ZBrush

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.790 

edit

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:53.920 

and<00:00:45.800> now<00:00:49.390> dynamesh<00:00:50.390> this<00:00:50.600> sucker<00:00:52.750> bump<00:00:53.750> it<00:00:53.870> up

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
and now dynamesh this sucker bump it up

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:04.210 
and now dynamesh this sucker bump it up
a<00:00:54.020> little<00:00:54.140> more<00:00:56.950> good<00:00:57.950> enough<00:01:00.670> so<00:01:01.670> I<00:01:02.890> meet<00:01:03.890> this

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
a little more good enough so I meet this

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.060 
a little more good enough so I meet this
right<00:01:04.580> here<00:01:05.000> which<00:01:05.570> is<00:01:05.690> a<00:01:05.720> title<00:01:06.260> image<00:01:06.920> the

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
right here which is a title image the

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.030 
right here which is a title image the
same<00:01:07.280> way<00:01:07.490> that<00:01:07.670> limited<00:01:08.120> it<00:01:08.240> is<00:01:08.860> with<00:01:09.860> the

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
same way that limited it is with the

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:18.150 
same way that limited it is with the
z-buffer<00:01:13.869> and<00:01:14.869> now<00:01:15.410> I<00:01:15.830> am<00:01:16.369> going<00:01:16.700> to<00:01:17.150> go<00:01:17.420> to

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
z-buffer and now I am going to go to

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.900 
z-buffer and now I am going to go to
surface<00:01:19.160> right<00:01:19.610> over<00:01:19.940> here<00:01:20.800> surface<00:01:21.910> noise

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:22.910 
surface right over here surface noise

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.520 
surface right over here surface noise
it's<00:01:23.570> kind<00:01:23.750> of<00:01:23.780> weird<00:01:23.990> that<00:01:24.050> it's<00:01:24.229> grayed<00:01:24.500> out

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
it's kind of weird that it's grayed out

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.389 
it's kind of weird that it's grayed out
but<00:01:24.979> the<00:01:25.190> works<00:01:25.399> and<00:01:26.920> took<00:01:27.920> me<00:01:28.070> forever<00:01:28.250> to

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399 
but the works and took me forever to

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:29.920 
but the works and took me forever to
figure<00:01:28.700> this<00:01:28.850> out<00:01:29.030> how<00:01:29.360> am<00:01:29.540> I<00:01:29.600> going<00:01:29.720> to<00:01:29.780> bring

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
figure this out how am I going to bring

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.420 
figure this out how am I going to bring
an<00:01:30.050> image<00:01:30.170> into<00:01:30.560> this<00:01:30.710> and<00:01:30.920> I<00:01:30.979> watched<00:01:31.190> a<00:01:31.310> few

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
an image into this and I watched a few

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.160 
an image into this and I watched a few
tutorials<00:01:31.700> and<00:01:32.300> figure<00:01:32.479> out<00:01:32.600> this<00:01:32.780> button

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
tutorials and figure out this button

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.160 
tutorials and figure out this button
right<00:01:33.350> down<00:01:33.380> here<00:01:33.850> and<00:01:34.850> there's<00:01:35.390> been<00:01:35.570> a<00:01:35.690> title

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
right down here and there's been a title

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.580 
right down here and there's been a title
sneaked<00:01:36.410> in<00:01:36.619> and<00:01:36.830> nothing<00:01:37.640> happens<00:01:38.590> that's

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
sneaked in and nothing happens that's

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.130 
sneaked in and nothing happens that's
because<00:01:40.040> I<00:01:40.070> have<00:01:40.340> the<00:01:40.490> strength<00:01:40.820> set<00:01:41.780> to<00:01:41.899> zero

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
because I have the strength set to zero

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.740 
because I have the strength set to zero
so<00:01:42.680> you<00:01:42.979> can<00:01:43.340> see<00:01:43.550> as<00:01:43.700> I<00:01:43.790> move<00:01:43.970> it<00:01:44.180> this<00:01:44.330> happens

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
so you can see as I move it this happens

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.560 
so you can see as I move it this happens
but<00:01:44.899> it's<00:01:45.050> too<00:01:45.259> big<00:01:45.530> you<00:01:45.770> can<00:01:46.130> scale<00:01:46.729> it<00:01:46.759> and

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
but it's too big you can scale it and

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.660 
but it's too big you can scale it and
you<00:01:47.960> can<00:01:48.110> automatically<00:01:48.740> see<00:01:49.069> it<00:01:49.160> updating

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
you can automatically see it updating

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.320 
you can automatically see it updating
right<00:01:49.910> there<00:01:50.179> and<00:01:50.979> this<00:01:51.979> is<00:01:52.100> my<00:01:52.220> really<00:01:52.550> like

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
right there and this is my really like

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.900 
right there and this is my really like
first<00:01:53.720> time<00:01:54.110> using<00:01:54.440> this<00:01:54.649> well<00:01:55.369> today's<00:01:55.880> my

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
first time using this well today's my

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.609 
first time using this well today's my
first<00:01:56.179> time<00:01:56.450> is<00:01:56.630> it<00:01:56.750> probably<00:01:57.050> my<00:01:57.140> fifth<00:01:57.200> time

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
first time is it probably my fifth time

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.770 
first time is it probably my fifth time
trying<00:01:58.160> this<00:01:58.250> out<00:01:58.580> come<00:01:59.390> mess<00:01:59.539> with<00:01:59.660> this

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
trying this out come mess with this

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.380 
trying this out come mess with this
curve<00:02:00.110> to<00:02:00.470> adjust<00:02:00.860> the<00:02:00.979> smoothness<00:02:01.459> of<00:02:01.610> it<00:02:01.819> now

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
curve to adjust the smoothness of it now

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.840 
curve to adjust the smoothness of it now
you<00:02:02.450> could<00:02:02.780> project<00:02:03.259> it<00:02:03.440> on<00:02:03.649> it<00:02:04.009> a<00:02:04.100> 2d<00:02:04.610> or<00:02:04.789> 3d

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
you could project it on it a 2d or 3d

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.760 
you could project it on it a 2d or 3d
now<00:02:05.390> there's<00:02:05.600> also<00:02:05.720> an<00:02:05.899> option<00:02:06.170> for<00:02:06.350> you<00:02:06.530> via

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
now there's also an option for you via

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.440 
now there's also an option for you via
that<00:02:07.100> I<00:02:07.369> don't<00:02:07.640> know<00:02:07.729> how<00:02:07.819> to<00:02:07.880> meet<00:02:08.149> the<00:02:08.270> actual

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
that I don't know how to meet the actual

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.830 
that I don't know how to meet the actual
UV<00:02:09.140> of<00:02:09.319> this<00:02:09.619> but<00:02:09.860> it<00:02:10.069> would<00:02:10.429> actually<00:02:11.000> wrap

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
UV of this but it would actually wrap

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.990 
UV of this but it would actually wrap
around<00:02:11.870> a<00:02:12.380> lot<00:02:12.590> nicer<00:02:12.890> and<00:02:13.310> I'm<00:02:13.459> hoping<00:02:13.790> that

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
around a lot nicer and I'm hoping that

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.540 
around a lot nicer and I'm hoping that
one<00:02:14.240> of<00:02:14.270> you<00:02:14.500> who's<00:02:15.500> out<00:02:15.800> there<00:02:15.830> can<00:02:16.220> actually

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
one of you who's out there can actually

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.140 
one of you who's out there can actually
show<00:02:17.060> us<00:02:17.240> how<00:02:17.390> to<00:02:17.450> do<00:02:17.660> that<00:02:18.340> but<00:02:19.340> for<00:02:19.580> now<00:02:19.730> I'll

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
show us how to do that but for now I'll

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.740 
show us how to do that but for now I'll
show<00:02:20.390> you<00:02:20.420> what<00:02:20.569> I'm<00:02:20.930> gonna<00:02:21.110> do<00:02:21.200> so<00:02:22.480> get<00:02:23.480> it<00:02:23.630> to

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
show you what I'm gonna do so get it to

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.050 
show you what I'm gonna do so get it to
a<00:02:23.810> scale<00:02:24.080> you<00:02:24.200> like<00:02:25.690> strength<00:02:26.690> you<00:02:26.840> like<00:02:28.060> now

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
a scale you like strength you like now

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.630 
a scale you like strength you like now
I've<00:02:29.209> messed<00:02:29.420> with<00:02:29.540> these<00:02:29.780> and<00:02:30.220> we<00:02:31.220> really

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
I've messed with these and we really

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.270 
I've messed with these and we really
didn't<00:02:31.910> do<00:02:32.000> anything<00:02:32.030> so<00:02:32.780> it's<00:02:33.560> something<00:02:34.220> I

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
didn't do anything so it's something I

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.860 
didn't do anything so it's something I
need<00:02:34.430> to<00:02:34.459> look<00:02:34.700> more<00:02:34.880> into<00:02:35.090> but<00:02:35.480> this<00:02:35.599> is<00:02:35.750> what

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
need to look more into but this is what

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.870 
need to look more into but this is what
I'm<00:02:35.959> working<00:02:36.050> with<00:02:36.260> right<00:02:36.290> now<00:02:36.440> hit<00:02:37.220> OK<00:02:37.640> and

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
I'm working with right now hit OK and

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:45.420 
I'm working with right now hit OK and
here<00:02:38.840> you<00:02:38.959> have<00:02:40.180> so<00:02:41.180> looks<00:02:42.080> good<00:02:42.459> um

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
here you have so looks good um

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.520 
here you have so looks good um
now<00:02:46.269> this<00:02:46.510> happens<00:02:46.900> because<00:02:47.049> it's<00:02:47.319> not

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
now this happens because it's not

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.429 
now this happens because it's not
wrapped<00:02:47.799> around<00:02:47.950> on<00:02:48.310> a<00:02:48.340> UV<00:02:49.049> it's<00:02:50.049> actually

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:50.439 
wrapped around on a UV it's actually

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:54.300 
wrapped around on a UV it's actually
kind<00:02:50.680> of<00:02:50.739> projecting<00:02:51.280> it<00:02:51.430> down<00:02:53.069> for<00:02:54.069> this<00:02:54.189> I

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
kind of projecting it down for this I

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.179 
kind of projecting it down for this I
think<00:02:54.489> it's<00:02:54.610> acceptable<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.860> as<00:02:56.860> you<00:02:57.010> see<00:02:57.159> I

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:57.189 
think it's acceptable and as you see I

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:01.740 
think it's acceptable and as you see I
could<00:02:57.459> do<00:02:58.000> this<00:02:58.180> to<00:02:58.390> it<00:02:58.540> and<00:02:58.720> it's<00:03:00.569> it's<00:03:01.569> not

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
could do this to it and it's it's not

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.690 
could do this to it and it's it's not
really<00:03:01.900> affecting<00:03:02.620> the<00:03:02.890> scales<00:03:03.189> too<00:03:03.459> much

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
really affecting the scales too much

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.030 
really affecting the scales too much
that's<00:03:04.299> because<00:03:04.870> I<00:03:05.170> didn't<00:03:05.439> actually<00:03:05.560> apply

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
that's because I didn't actually apply

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.039 
that's because I didn't actually apply
it<00:03:06.069> to<00:03:06.310> the<00:03:06.400> mesh<00:03:06.609> so<00:03:07.299> if<00:03:07.480> I<00:03:07.599> do<00:03:08.019> something

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
it to the mesh so if I do something

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.699 
it to the mesh so if I do something
wacky<00:03:08.590> like<00:03:09.480> take<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:10.629> snake<00:03:10.870> hook<00:03:11.079> and<00:03:11.290> yank

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
wacky like take the snake hook and yank

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.960 
wacky like take the snake hook and yank
them<00:03:11.859> out<00:03:12.599> you<00:03:13.599> see<00:03:13.810> that<00:03:14.519> it<00:03:15.519> will<00:03:15.700> still

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
them out you see that it will still

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.430 
them out you see that it will still
apply<00:03:16.150> it<00:03:16.269> to<00:03:16.480> it<00:03:16.599> which<00:03:16.750> i<00:03:16.870> think<00:03:16.930> is<00:03:17.170> kind<00:03:17.379> of

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
apply it to it which i think is kind of

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.119 
apply it to it which i think is kind of
cool<00:03:17.500> could<00:03:17.859> be<00:03:17.950> very<00:03:18.159> useful<00:03:18.840> so<00:03:19.840> in<00:03:20.799> order<00:03:20.950> to

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:21.129 
cool could be very useful so in order to

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:22.910 
cool could be very useful so in order to
apply<00:03:21.370> it<00:03:21.489> you<00:03:21.790> need<00:03:21.940> to<00:03:21.970> make<00:03:22.180> sure<00:03:22.359> you<00:03:22.450> have

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
apply it you need to make sure you have

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.839 
apply it you need to make sure you have
enough<00:03:23.920> um

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:24.849 
enough um

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:28.379 
enough um
polygons<00:03:25.720> so<00:03:26.709> you<00:03:27.040> know<00:03:27.129> I'm<00:03:27.400> going<00:03:27.879> to<00:03:27.970> divide

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:28.389 
polygons so you know I'm going to divide

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:37.470 
polygons so you know I'm going to divide
this<00:03:28.659> few<00:03:29.500> times<00:03:31.079> /<00:03:35.579> okay<00:03:36.579> let's<00:03:37.000> see<00:03:37.209> how<00:03:37.359> this

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
this few times / okay let's see how this

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.920 
this few times / okay let's see how this
works<00:03:37.750> now<00:03:38.019> when<00:03:38.109> I<00:03:38.170> hit<00:03:38.409> apply<00:03:38.739> to<00:03:38.859> mesh<00:03:39.930> not

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
works now when I hit apply to mesh not

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.949 
works now when I hit apply to mesh not
too<00:03:41.109> bad<00:03:44.939> so<00:03:45.939> now<00:03:45.970> if<00:03:46.269> I<00:03:46.359> start<00:03:46.420> to<00:03:46.689> move<00:03:46.810> it

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
too bad so now if I start to move it

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.520 
too bad so now if I start to move it
around<00:03:47.459> that<00:03:48.459> kind<00:03:48.700> of<00:03:48.730> thing<00:03:48.909> happens<00:03:49.530> very

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
around that kind of thing happens very

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.080 
around that kind of thing happens very
pretty<00:03:51.599> but<00:03:52.599> now<00:03:52.870> you<00:03:52.930> can<00:03:53.169> smooth<00:03:53.530> it<00:03:53.709> and<00:03:54.669> do

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
pretty but now you can smooth it and do

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.780 
pretty but now you can smooth it and do
whatever<00:03:55.239> you<00:03:55.510> want<00:03:55.690> to<00:03:55.840> it<00:03:59.129> so<00:04:00.129> that's<00:04:00.519> what<00:04:00.730> I

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
whatever you want to it so that's what I

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.319 
whatever you want to it so that's what I
got<00:04:01.060> that's<00:04:01.299> my<00:04:01.449> discovery<00:04:01.930> for<00:04:02.079> the<00:04:02.169> day
