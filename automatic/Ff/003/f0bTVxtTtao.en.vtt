00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
it then after that um don't click to

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.100 
it then after that um don't click to
make<00:03:01.120> your<00:03:01.300> materials<00:03:02.130> and<00:03:03.690> what's<00:03:04.690> the<00:03:04.840> first

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
make your materials and what's the first

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:10.580 
make your materials and what's the first
one<00:03:05.410> um<00:03:07.200> choose<00:03:08.200> this<00:03:08.560> actually<00:03:09.550> just<00:03:09.670> do<00:03:09.790> this

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
one um choose this actually just do this

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.510 
one um choose this actually just do this
ecology<00:03:11.880> pure<00:03:12.880> white<00:03:13.150> um<00:03:14.020> go<00:03:14.890> to<00:03:14.950> luminance

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
ecology pure white um go to luminance

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.860 
ecology pure white um go to luminance
what<00:03:16.030> click<00:03:16.480> and<00:03:16.720> then<00:03:18.090> just<00:03:19.090> changes<00:03:19.630> are

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
what click and then just changes are

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.680 
what click and then just changes are
cheap<00:03:20.290> um<00:03:20.470> are<00:03:20.950> you<00:03:21.010> see<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.459> colliding<00:03:21.910> when

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
cheap um are you see the colliding when

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.970 
cheap um are you see the colliding when
I<00:03:22.720> meet<00:03:22.989> the<00:03:23.170> UM<00:03:23.440> on<00:03:24.070> the<00:03:25.030> wall<00:03:25.209> so<00:03:25.540> I<00:03:25.980> think

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
I meet the UM on the wall so I think

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.960 
I meet the UM on the wall so I think
this<00:03:27.459> will<00:03:28.110> revive<00:03:29.110> this<00:03:29.260> blue

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.090 

change<00:03:33.690> the<00:03:33.900> brightness<00:03:34.050> to<00:03:34.590> Freehan

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
change the brightness to Freehan

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:43.330 
change the brightness to Freehan
actually<00:03:38.100> in<00:03:38.250> order<00:03:38.520> to<00:03:38.640> go<00:03:38.820> here<00:03:39.090> and<00:03:40.790> now

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
actually in order to go here and now

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:50.870 
actually in order to go here and now
after<00:03:44.340> that<00:03:45.260> go<00:03:46.260> to<00:03:47.120> try<00:03:48.120> this<00:03:48.180> Oh<00:03:48.540> chi-su<00:03:49.880> and

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
after that go to try this Oh chi-su and

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.230 
after that go to try this Oh chi-su and
I<00:03:51.330> would<00:03:51.630> no<00:03:51.960> actually<00:03:52.650> I<00:03:52.950> guess<00:03:53.550> until<00:03:54.740> wrong

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:56.240 
I would no actually I guess until wrong

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.280 
I would no actually I guess until wrong
once<00:03:57.240> you<00:03:57.450> selected<00:03:58.020> and<00:03:58.830> then<00:03:58.860> on<00:03:59.760> to<00:03:59.940> those

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
once you selected and then on to those

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.310 
once you selected and then on to those
just<00:04:01.290> fancy<00:04:02.180> and<00:04:03.180> after<00:04:03.540> that<00:04:03.570> we<00:04:03.930> want<00:04:04.170> to

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
just fancy and after that we want to

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.300 
just fancy and after that we want to
produce<00:04:04.950> second<00:04:05.880> material<00:04:06.209> and<00:04:07.010> just<00:04:08.010> change

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
produce second material and just change

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:14.540 
produce second material and just change
it<00:04:08.459> to<00:04:08.640> about<00:04:08.880> a<00:04:08.940> darkish<00:04:09.690> burger<00:04:12.140> so<00:04:13.370> then<00:04:14.370> go

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 
it to about a darkish burger so then go

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:21.289 
it to about a darkish burger so then go
to<00:04:18.650> there<00:04:19.650> you<00:04:19.739> go<00:04:19.890> for<00:04:20.130> the<00:04:20.160> color<00:04:20.459> and<00:04:20.910> then

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
to there you go for the color and then

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.740 
to there you go for the color and then
choose<00:04:21.570> this<00:04:21.750> to<00:04:21.959> the<00:04:22.080> luggage<00:04:22.380> p<00:04:23.120> and<00:04:24.120> then<00:04:24.360> go

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
choose this to the luggage p and then go

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:31.430 
choose this to the luggage p and then go
to<00:04:24.890> flexion<00:04:26.510> texture<00:04:27.510> for<00:04:27.900> now<00:04:29.480> and<00:04:30.480> that's

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
to flexion texture for now and that's

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.140 
to flexion texture for now and that's
about<00:04:31.590> it<00:04:32.060> going<00:04:33.060> to<00:04:33.180> have<00:04:33.330> this<00:04:33.510> come<00:04:33.840> through

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
about it going to have this come through

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.260 
about it going to have this come through
so<00:04:36.150> and<00:04:36.390> drag<00:04:36.780> it<00:04:36.930> to<00:04:36.960> about<00:04:37.800> what<00:04:38.610> everything

floor milbank just below on the school

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:21.360 
floor milbank just below on the school
and<00:05:17.880> then<00:05:18.880> outcome<00:05:19.690> I'm<00:05:20.680> sorry<00:05:21.010> about<00:05:21.220> how

and then outcome I'm sorry about how
long<00:05:21.610> things<00:05:21.910> it's<00:05:22.450> just<00:05:22.690> microfiche<00:05:23.169> free

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.010 
long things it's just microfiche free

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.909 
long things it's just microfiche free
happen<00:05:24.720> then<00:05:25.720> it<00:05:26.050> should<00:05:26.320> look<00:05:26.440> just<00:05:26.800> like

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
happen then it should look just like

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:36.750 
happen then it should look just like
this<00:05:28.110> you<00:05:29.110> should<00:05:29.350> know<00:05:33.510> and<00:05:34.510> there<00:05:35.139> we<00:05:35.229> go<00:05:35.760> and

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 
this you should know and there we go and

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.780 
this you should know and there we go and
that's<00:05:37.360> pretty<00:05:37.750> much<00:05:37.870> it<00:05:38.250> to<00:05:39.250> make<00:05:39.400> some<00:05:39.610> more

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:39.790 
that's pretty much it to make some more

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:44.940 
that's pretty much it to make some more
up<00:05:40.229> also<00:05:41.229> on<00:05:42.090> when<00:05:43.090> the<00:05:43.660> few<00:05:43.900> render<00:05:44.350> II<00:05:44.380> again

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:44.950 
up also on when the few render II again

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.640 
up also on when the few render II again
and<00:05:45.310> you'll<00:05:45.820> see<00:05:46.150> is<00:05:46.210> coming<00:05:46.539> out<00:05:46.660> any<00:05:47.380> other

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
and you'll see is coming out any other

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.700 
and you'll see is coming out any other
kind<00:05:47.830> of<00:05:48.010> rough<00:05:48.870> so<00:05:49.870> you<00:05:50.110> want<00:05:50.260> to<00:05:50.350> click<00:05:50.530> this

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
kind of rough so you want to click this

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.969 
kind of rough so you want to click this
actually<00:05:51.490> just<00:05:51.940> go<00:05:52.120> here<00:05:52.510> go<00:05:52.840> to<00:05:53.410> hibernate

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:53.979 
actually just go here go to hibernate

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:57.360 
actually just go here go to hibernate
and<00:05:54.160> drag<00:05:54.789> the<00:05:54.940> sphere<00:05:55.210> and<00:05:55.630> to<00:05:55.870> do<00:05:56.220> what<00:05:57.220> that

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 
and drag the sphere and to do what that

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.610 
and drag the sphere and to do what that
does<00:05:57.580> it<00:05:57.880> just<00:05:58.270> moves<00:05:58.600> the<00:05:58.750> hosts<00:05:59.229> we're<00:05:59.440> out

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
does it just moves the hosts we're out

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.879 
does it just moves the hosts we're out
so<00:05:59.919> it<00:06:00.160> looks<00:06:00.340> much<00:06:00.669> much<00:06:00.970> better<00:06:01.180> and<00:06:02.169> that's

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:02.889 
so it looks much much better and that's

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:05.640 
so it looks much much better and that's
about<00:06:03.070> it<00:06:03.160> to<00:06:03.490> me<00:06:03.580> or<00:06:03.850> spheres<00:06:04.150> this<00:06:04.650> harmed

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.650 
about it to me or spheres this harmed

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:09.510 
about it to me or spheres this harmed
here<00:06:05.940> and<00:06:06.940> chose<00:06:07.270> seek<00:06:07.900> to<00:06:08.289> leave<00:06:08.530> I'll<00:06:09.460> just

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 
here and chose seek to leave I'll just

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.089 
here and chose seek to leave I'll just
drag<00:06:09.940> out<00:06:10.150> to<00:06:10.599> where<00:06:10.750> we<00:06:10.990> will<00:06:11.139> just<00:06:11.650> continue

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:12.099 
drag out to where we will just continue

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:14.430 
drag out to where we will just continue
the<00:06:12.340> process<00:06:12.599> and<00:06:13.599> that's<00:06:13.720> about<00:06:13.930> it<00:06:14.050> so

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:14.440 
the process and that's about it so
