00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.880 
intense and part of that it's just her
nature<00:00:53.520> but<00:00:54.360> she<00:00:54.570> clearly<00:00:54.930> has<00:00:55.320> not<00:00:55.500> had<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.800> lot

going<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.690> see<00:01:03.899> in<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.290> minute<00:01:05.840> was<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.869> little

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
going to see in a minute was a little

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.690 
going to see in a minute was a little
bit<00:01:07.170> hard<00:01:07.350> for<00:01:07.530> me<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.710> read<00:01:07.890> at<00:01:08.040> first<00:01:08.310> this

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
bit hard for me to read at first this

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.070 
bit hard for me to read at first this
kind<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.060> intensity<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.750> you're<00:01:09.869> seeing

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
kind of intensity that you're seeing

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.050 
kind of intensity that you're seeing
right<00:01:10.170> here<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.770> didn't<00:01:11.520> quite<00:01:11.640> know<00:01:11.700> how<00:01:12.030> to

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
right here I didn't quite know how to

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.690 
right here I didn't quite know how to
judge<00:01:12.450> her<00:01:12.720> when<00:01:13.290> she<00:01:13.470> first<00:01:13.650> came<00:01:13.860> in<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.250> was

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
judge her when she first came in it was

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.820 
judge her when she first came in it was
hard<00:01:14.939> for<00:01:15.030> me<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.210> tell<00:01:15.390> if<00:01:15.570> she<00:01:15.780> was<00:01:15.830> playful

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
hard for me to tell if she was playful

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.800 
hard for me to tell if she was playful
or<00:01:17.280> if<00:01:17.610> this<00:01:17.759> was<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.330> beginning<00:01:18.479> of

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
or if this was the beginning of

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.230 
or if this was the beginning of
something<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:20.310> could<00:01:20.520> be<00:01:20.549> aggressive<00:01:21.030> but

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
something that could be aggressive but

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.719 
something that could be aggressive but
it's<00:01:21.299> become<00:01:21.630> clear<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:22.280> her<00:01:23.280> intentions

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
it's become clear that her intentions

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.070 
it's become clear that her intentions
are<00:01:23.850> actually<00:01:24.090> good<00:01:24.299> here<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:24.780> she's<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:24.990> bit

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
are actually good here so she's a bit

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.649 
are actually good here so she's a bit
intense<00:01:25.619> about<00:01:26.009> her<00:01:26.400> desire<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:26.909> play<00:01:27.270> but<00:01:27.630> she

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
later we've been doing a lot of

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.699 
later we've been doing a lot of
socialization<00:03:03.630> with<00:03:03.780> Nina<00:03:03.959> but<00:03:04.500> this<00:03:04.620> is

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
socialization with Nina but this is

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.330 
socialization with Nina but this is
actually<00:03:05.010> her<00:03:05.100> first<00:03:05.430> time<00:03:05.930> being<00:03:07.010> off<00:03:08.010> leash

indoors<00:03:11.910> can<00:03:12.150> actually<00:03:12.450> be<00:03:12.600> very<00:03:12.630> different

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
indoors can actually be very different

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.090 
indoors can actually be very different
from<00:03:13.260> being<00:03:13.350> outdoors

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100

having a roof over the dogs heads can

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.900 
having a roof over the dogs heads can
actually<00:03:18.480> create<00:03:18.810> a<00:03:18.840> lot<00:03:19.110> more<00:03:19.350> pressure<00:03:19.910> as

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
actually create a lot more pressure as

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.790 
actually create a lot more pressure as
far<00:03:20.970> as<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.420> space<00:03:21.660> is<00:03:21.840> concerned<00:03:22.260> so<00:03:22.590> it's

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
far as the space is concerned so it's

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.290 
far as the space is concerned so it's
really<00:03:22.920> good<00:03:23.190> to<00:03:23.220> see<00:03:23.370> that<00:03:23.700> she's<00:03:23.850> doing<00:03:23.970> well

less<00:03:28.739> intense<00:03:29.450> her<00:03:30.450> movement<00:03:30.989> is<00:03:31.170> less<00:03:31.470> jumpy

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220

and<00:03:32.370> jittery<00:03:32.760> and<00:03:32.970> she's<00:03:33.510> really<00:03:33.690> starting<00:03:34.050> to

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
and jittery and she's really starting to

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.140 
and jittery and she's really starting to
calm<00:03:34.350> down<00:03:34.380> and<00:03:35.070> learn<00:03:35.640> how<00:03:35.820> to<00:03:35.850> integrate

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
calm down and learn how to integrate

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.449 
calm down and learn how to integrate
with<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.570> other<00:03:36.690> dogs<00:03:36.989> in<00:03:37.350> a<00:03:37.739> more<00:03:37.950> natural

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
with the other dogs in a more natural

00:03:38.459 --> 00:04:00.330 
with the other dogs in a more natural
fashion

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.800 

so<00:04:01.340> the<00:04:01.430> next<00:04:01.610> step<00:04:01.820> for<00:04:01.850> Nina<00:04:02.270> would<00:04:02.420> be<00:04:02.570> to

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
so the next step for Nina would be to

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.020 
so the next step for Nina would be to
get<00:04:02.960> the<00:04:03.140> muzzle<00:04:03.350> off<00:04:03.680> but<00:04:04.370> we're<00:04:04.640> not<00:04:04.760> quite

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
get the muzzle off but we're not quite

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.270 
get the muzzle off but we're not quite
ready<00:04:05.300> for<00:04:05.390> that<00:04:05.570> yet<00:04:05.870> I'll<00:04:06.620> try<00:04:06.860> and<00:04:06.980> get<00:04:07.100> some

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280
