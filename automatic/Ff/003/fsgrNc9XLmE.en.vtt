you want to put a mark you want to do

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.300 
you want to put a mark you want to do
the<00:02:01.539> same<00:02:01.780> thing<00:02:02.050> on<00:02:02.170> the<00:02:02.350> bottom<00:02:02.740> and<00:02:02.920> then<00:02:03.160> in

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
the same thing on the bottom and then in

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.969 
the same thing on the bottom and then in
the<00:02:03.460> back<00:02:03.700> you<00:02:04.119> you<00:02:04.899> measure<00:02:05.140> just<00:02:05.410> slightly

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
the back you you measure just slightly

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.639 
the back you you measure just slightly
beyond<00:02:06.640> what<00:02:07.569> it<00:02:07.690> would<00:02:07.840> take<00:02:08.080> for<00:02:08.110> this<00:02:08.470> the

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
beyond what it would take for this the

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.980 
beyond what it would take for this the
bottom<00:02:09.009> out<00:02:09.190> drilling<00:02:10.090> just<00:02:10.240> slightly<00:02:10.780> too

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
bottom out drilling just slightly too

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.990 
bottom out drilling just slightly too
deep<00:02:11.260> is<00:02:11.500> much<00:02:11.860> better<00:02:12.100> than<00:02:12.430> not<00:02:12.640> drilling

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
deep is much better than not drilling

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.730 
deep is much better than not drilling
deep<00:02:13.270> enough<00:02:13.569> and<00:02:13.900> then<00:02:14.050> put<00:02:14.230> a<00:02:14.260> mark<00:02:14.560> back

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
deep enough and then put a mark back

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.309 
deep enough and then put a mark back
there<00:02:15.010> once<00:02:15.880> you<00:02:16.060> have<00:02:16.300> those<00:02:16.540> three<00:02:16.840> marks

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
there once you have those three marks

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.340 
there once you have those three marks
you<00:02:18.250> now<00:02:18.490> have<00:02:18.819> the<00:02:19.090> width<00:02:19.420> of<00:02:19.630> your<00:02:19.840> cut<00:02:20.080> and

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
you now have the width of your cut and

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.680 
you now have the width of your cut and
the<00:02:20.620> depth<00:02:20.920> of<00:02:21.100> your<00:02:21.160> cut<00:02:21.390> simply<00:02:22.390> go<00:02:22.569> ahead

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
the depth of your cut simply go ahead

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.690

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
I did was I blackened out this side of

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.450 
I did was I blackened out this side of
the<00:02:46.480> stud<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:46.959> referee's

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
the stud the referee's

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.270 
the stud the referee's
a<00:02:47.490> typical<00:02:48.090> door<00:02:48.360> thickness<00:02:48.900> so<00:02:49.800> what<00:02:50.130> I<00:02:50.160> did

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
a typical door thickness so what I did

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.220 
a typical door thickness so what I did
at<00:02:50.550> this<00:02:50.730> point<00:02:51.030> was<00:02:51.180> I<00:02:51.300> took<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.690> two<00:02:51.870> marks

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
at this point was I took the two marks

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.600 
at this point was I took the two marks
that<00:02:52.350> were<00:02:52.440> on<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:52.710> side<00:02:52.920> of<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.190> door<00:02:53.400> and<00:02:53.550> I

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
that were on the side of the door and I

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.950 
that were on the side of the door and I
brought<00:02:53.790> them<00:02:53.910> around<00:02:54.180> to<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.420> front<00:02:54.660> which

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
brought them around to the front which

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.330 
brought them around to the front which
are<00:02:55.140> four<00:02:55.350> inches<00:02:55.710> wide

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
are four inches wide

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.340 
are four inches wide
then<00:02:57.000> what<00:02:57.180> I<00:02:57.210> did<00:02:57.330> was<00:02:57.510> I<00:02:57.660> took<00:02:57.810> my<00:02:58.110> door

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
then what I did was I took my door

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.460 
then what I did was I took my door
thickness<00:02:58.830> and<00:02:59.010> I<00:02:59.100> divided<00:02:59.670> it<00:02:59.820> in<00:02:59.970> half<00:03:00.170> now<00:03:01.170> I

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
thickness and I divided it in half now I

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.560 
thickness and I divided it in half now I
know<00:03:01.590> I'm<00:03:02.010> gonna<00:03:02.190> want<00:03:02.520> a<00:03:02.700> half<00:03:03.000> inch<00:03:03.300> deep

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
know I'm gonna want a half inch deep

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.040 
know I'm gonna want a half inch deep
hole<00:03:03.840> they<00:03:04.710> are<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:05.010> half-inch<00:03:05.640> wide<00:03:05.940> hole<00:03:06.360> that

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
hole they are a half-inch wide hole that

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.050 
hole they are a half-inch wide hole that
goes<00:03:07.350> one<00:03:07.740> in<00:03:07.890> one<00:03:08.070> quarter<00:03:08.430> inches<00:03:08.760> deep<00:03:09.030> to

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
goes one in one quarter inches deep to

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.260 
goes one in one quarter inches deep to
fit<00:03:09.570> that<00:03:09.750> mortise<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:11.190> way<00:03:11.340> I<00:03:11.370> began<00:03:11.790> was<00:03:12.090> I

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
fit that mortise the way I began was I

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.540 
fit that mortise the way I began was I
take<00:03:12.900> my<00:03:13.080> spade<00:03:13.440> bit<00:03:13.710> and<00:03:13.980> I'm<00:03:14.070> going<00:03:14.220> to<00:03:14.310> drill

take my spade bit and I'm going to drill

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.970 
take my spade bit and I'm going to drill
a<00:03:14.580> multiple<00:03:15.180> set<00:03:15.450> of<00:03:15.600> holes<00:03:15.840> all<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:16.530> way<00:03:16.740> down

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
a multiple set of holes all the way down

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.490 
a multiple set of holes all the way down
this<00:03:17.190> line<00:03:17.460> now<00:03:18.060> I<00:03:18.090> took<00:03:18.540> my<00:03:18.720> tape<00:03:18.990> and<00:03:19.260> I<00:03:19.470> put

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.560 
this line now I took my tape and I put
it<00:03:19.890> at<00:03:20.100> an<00:03:20.220> inch<00:03:20.490> and<00:03:20.670> a<00:03:20.700> quarter<00:03:20.910> thickness

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
it at an inch and a quarter thickness

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.020 
it at an inch and a quarter thickness
from<00:03:21.840> this<00:03:22.140> this<00:03:22.830> point<00:03:23.520> here<00:03:23.760> where<00:03:23.880> it's

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
from this this point here where it's

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.490 
from this this point here where it's
gonna<00:03:24.120> make<00:03:24.360> the<00:03:24.480> bottom<00:03:24.810> of<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:24.990> hole<00:03:25.170> flat

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
gonna make the bottom of the hole flat

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.590 
gonna make the bottom of the hole flat
now<00:03:26.400> what<00:03:26.580> I'm<00:03:26.700> gonna<00:03:26.820> do<00:03:27.090> is<00:03:27.300> I'm<00:03:27.420> going<00:03:27.540> to

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.370 
now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
drill<00:03:27.780> to<00:03:27.900> drill<00:03:28.230> a<00:03:28.350> multiple<00:03:28.950> set<00:03:29.190> of<00:03:29.340> holes

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
drill to drill a multiple set of holes

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.950 
drill to drill a multiple set of holes
but<00:03:31.380> they<00:03:31.560> can't<00:03:31.830> overlap<00:03:32.480> because<00:03:33.480> if<00:03:33.810> they

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960 
but they can't overlap because if they

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.380 
but they can't overlap because if they
overlap<00:03:34.340> they're<00:03:35.340> gonna<00:03:35.490> start<00:03:35.790> running<00:03:36.210> into

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
overlap they're gonna start running into

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.420 
overlap they're gonna start running into
each<00:03:36.540> other<00:03:36.900> so<00:03:37.470> I<00:03:37.500> want<00:03:37.860> to<00:03:37.890> keep<00:03:38.070> the<00:03:38.220> hole

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
each other so I want to keep the hole

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.790 
each other so I want to keep the hole
separated<00:03:39.270> enough<00:03:39.660> so<00:03:40.110> that<00:03:40.290> I<00:03:40.320> still<00:03:40.620> have

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
separated enough so that I still have

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.280 
separated enough so that I still have
solid<00:03:41.310> drilling<00:03:41.670> material<00:03:42.150> to<00:03:42.240> go<00:03:42.390> in<00:03:42.600> now<00:03:43.230> I

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
solid drilling material to go in now I

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.900 
solid drilling material to go in now I
want<00:03:43.530> to<00:03:43.590> line<00:03:43.830> it<00:03:43.860> up<00:03:44.100> nice<00:03:44.370> and<00:03:44.400> square<00:03:44.880> with

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
want to line it up nice and square with

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.590 
want to line it up nice and square with
the<00:03:45.210> front<00:03:45.480> and<00:03:45.720> start<00:03:46.290> drilling<00:03:46.590> these<00:03:46.770> holes

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
the front and start drilling these holes

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.480 
the front and start drilling these holes
now<00:03:48.600> I<00:03:48.630> have<00:03:49.200> my<00:03:49.350> multiple<00:03:49.890> set<00:03:50.130> of<00:03:50.250> holes

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
now I have my multiple set of holes

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.700 
now I have my multiple set of holes
drilled<00:03:50.940> all<00:03:51.300> one<00:03:51.630> on<00:03:51.780> top<00:03:51.990> of<00:03:52.050> each<00:03:52.290> other

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:52.710 
drilled all one on top of each other

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.550 
drilled all one on top of each other
I<00:03:52.910> hold<00:03:53.910> my<00:03:54.090> mortise<00:03:54.690> lock<00:03:54.810> up<00:03:55.200> to<00:03:55.350> make<00:03:55.530> sure

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
I hold my mortise lock up to make sure

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.310 
I hold my mortise lock up to make sure
that<00:03:55.890> as<00:03:56.400> it<00:03:56.730> is<00:03:56.910> these<00:03:57.210> two<00:03:57.450> screws<00:03:57.870> here<00:03:58.140> are

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
that as it is these two screws here are

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.590 
that as it is these two screws here are
the<00:03:58.440> the<00:03:58.800> widest<00:03:59.190> point<00:03:59.520> and<00:03:59.670> make<00:04:00.240> sure<00:04:00.450> that

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
the the widest point and make sure that

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.790 
the the widest point and make sure that
they're<00:04:00.750> actually<00:04:00.900> going<00:04:01.230> to<00:04:01.320> line<00:04:01.560> up<00:04:01.770> with

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
they're actually going to line up with

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.000 
they're actually going to line up with
that<00:04:02.130> hole<00:04:02.600> but<00:04:03.600> it's<00:04:03.810> hardly<00:04:04.230> gonna<00:04:04.500> fit<00:04:04.800> in

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
that hole but it's hardly gonna fit in

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.220 
that hole but it's hardly gonna fit in
there<00:04:05.190> I<00:04:05.430> mean<00:04:05.940> it's<00:04:06.120> pretty<00:04:06.270> obvious<00:04:06.840> at<00:04:07.080> this

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
there I mean it's pretty obvious at this

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.990 
there I mean it's pretty obvious at this
point<00:04:07.560> I<00:04:07.680> guess<00:04:07.860> I<00:04:08.010> could<00:04:08.190> take<00:04:08.340> out<00:04:08.520> a<00:04:08.550> sharp

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
point I guess I could take out a sharp

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.530 
point I guess I could take out a sharp
chisel<00:04:09.330> and<00:04:09.810> I<00:04:09.870> can<00:04:10.050> start<00:04:10.260> working<00:04:10.470> on<00:04:10.740> this

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
chisel and I can start working on this

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.730 
chisel and I can start working on this
but<00:04:12.540> then<00:04:12.720> there's<00:04:12.930> always<00:04:13.110> a<00:04:13.260> chance<00:04:13.590> that

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
but then there's always a chance that

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.440 
but then there's always a chance that
you<00:04:13.920> could<00:04:14.070> split<00:04:14.490> out<00:04:14.640> the<00:04:14.670> sides<00:04:15.090> of<00:04:15.360> the

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
you could split out the sides of the

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.390 
you could split out the sides of the
door<00:04:15.720> I<00:04:15.930> have<00:04:16.380> another<00:04:16.620> tool<00:04:16.920> I'd<00:04:17.070> like<00:04:17.280> to

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
door I have another tool I'd like to

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.920 
door I have another tool I'd like to
show<00:04:17.549> you<00:04:17.610> what<00:04:17.820> I<00:04:17.850> have<00:04:18.180> here<00:04:18.450> is<00:04:18.570> a<00:04:18.600> standard

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
show you what I have here is a standard

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.920 
show you what I have here is a standard
drill<00:04:19.410> bit<00:04:19.620> it's<00:04:20.310> got<00:04:20.460> the<00:04:20.640> twisted<00:04:21.150> cut<00:04:21.600> steel

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
drill bit it's got the twisted cut steel

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.420 
drill bit it's got the twisted cut steel
that<00:04:22.170> goes<00:04:22.350> all<00:04:22.590> the<00:04:22.620> way<00:04:22.740> up<00:04:22.890> to<00:04:23.070> the<00:04:23.190> top

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
that goes all the way up to the top

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.280 
that goes all the way up to the top
that's<00:04:23.970> me<00:04:24.210> for<00:04:24.450> just<00:04:24.660> drilling<00:04:24.960> holes

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
that's me for just drilling holes

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.160 
that's me for just drilling holes
straight<00:04:25.650> in<00:04:25.890> now<00:04:26.670> what<00:04:26.940> this<00:04:27.180> one<00:04:27.390> is<00:04:27.570> here<00:04:27.960> it

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
straight in now what this one is here it

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.590 
straight in now what this one is here it
starts<00:04:28.560> out<00:04:28.680> the<00:04:28.890> same<00:04:29.130> in<00:04:29.310> the<00:04:29.430> beginning<00:04:29.940> but

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
starts out the same in the beginning but

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.940 
starts out the same in the beginning but
then<00:04:30.780> all<00:04:30.930> of<00:04:30.960> a<00:04:31.140> sudden<00:04:31.410> it<00:04:31.470> looks<00:04:31.530> like<00:04:31.830> it

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
then all of a sudden it looks like it

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.920 
then all of a sudden it looks like it
has<00:04:32.100> some<00:04:32.310> kind<00:04:32.490> of<00:04:32.640> industrial<00:04:32.970> accident

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
has some kind of industrial accident

has some kind of industrial accident
here<00:04:34.200> which<00:04:34.440> tore<00:04:34.770> up<00:04:34.950> all<00:04:35.160> the<00:04:35.340> sides<00:04:35.580> now

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
here which tore up all the sides now

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.410 
here which tore up all the sides now
what<00:04:36.750> this<00:04:36.990> is<00:04:37.320> is<00:04:37.560> this<00:04:38.130> is<00:04:38.310> a<00:04:38.340> side<00:04:38.850> cutting

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:39.420 
what this is is this is a side cutting

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.690 
what this is is this is a side cutting
drill<00:04:39.720> bit<00:04:39.930> not<00:04:40.590> only<00:04:40.890> is<00:04:40.980> it<00:04:41.010> made<00:04:41.310> to<00:04:41.430> drill

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
drill bit not only is it made to drill

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.850 
drill bit not only is it made to drill
holes<00:04:41.880> straight<00:04:42.240> through<00:04:42.690> but<00:04:43.410> you<00:04:43.530> can<00:04:43.680> also

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
holes straight through but you can also

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.060 
holes straight through but you can also
elongate<00:04:44.790> holes<00:04:45.120> or<00:04:45.480> smooth<00:04:45.930> out<00:04:46.200> sides<00:04:46.650> of

elongate holes or smooth out sides of
elongated<00:04:47.640> holes<00:04:48.000> this<00:04:48.720> is<00:04:48.780> what<00:04:49.110> we're<00:04:49.230> going

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
elongated holes this is what we're going

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:58.570 
elongated holes this is what we're going
to<00:04:49.470> use<00:04:49.680> to<00:04:49.860> make<00:04:50.040> our<00:04:50.160> notch

now I'm not trying to mislead you while

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.770 
now I'm not trying to mislead you while
I<00:05:01.500> was<00:05:01.770> off-camera<00:05:01.980> here<00:05:02.610> it<00:05:03.300> took<00:05:03.600> me<00:05:03.750> I

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
I was off-camera here it took me I

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.780 
I was off-camera here it took me I
probably<00:05:04.320> worked<00:05:04.800> on<00:05:04.980> this<00:05:05.100> whole<00:05:05.340> for<00:05:05.610> about

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
probably worked on this whole for about

this bit around for a long time and for

this bit around for a long time and for
some<00:06:26.640> reason<00:06:27.030> never<00:06:27.180> thought<00:06:27.510> of<00:06:27.660> making<00:06:27.750> a

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:27.960 
some reason never thought of making a

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:30.080 
some reason never thought of making a
video<00:06:28.110> of<00:06:28.320> it<00:06:28.620> and<00:06:28.800> then<00:06:29.100> I<00:06:29.430> was<00:06:29.790> looking

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.090 
video of it and then I was looking

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:31.760 
video of it and then I was looking
through<00:06:30.210> my<00:06:30.300> drill<00:06:30.660> box<00:06:30.870> it<00:06:31.080> came<00:06:31.200> across<00:06:31.350> it

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:31.770 
through my drill box it came across it

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:33.200 
through my drill box it came across it
and<00:06:31.860> I<00:06:31.890> thought<00:06:32.070> maybe<00:06:32.280> you'd<00:06:32.580> like<00:06:32.640> to<00:06:32.910> see<00:06:33.090> it

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.210
