00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.430
 we present you the new version of the 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.660
 quadripopter of parrot ar.drone 2 with 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.639
 which we will have more precise control 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.200
 we will reach more height than we will have 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.240
 recordings and photos in high definition 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.330
 all controlled through our 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.920
 iphone ipad or ipod touch- part includes 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.180
 a charger for your mille battery 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.820
 miglia amps with which we will obtain 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.260
 approximately 14 minutes of flight what 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.939
 first that we will have to do will be 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.699
 install your battery we will show you 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.650
 as we will just have to adjust the 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.160
 connector and fix it using a strong 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.160
 Velcro 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.910
 or call attention to the usb port and 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.739
 is that we can connect a pendrive 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.520
 to record there our photos and videos 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.740
 instead of on the iphone the ipad 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.990
 once the battery is inserted we will have 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.950
 to place its protective casing 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.810
 we have a special for flights 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.460
 inside the propellers will be protected 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.080
 so that they do not receive any damage if 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.300
 we hit something inside 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.700
 of the house also has a 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.530
 outdoor housing this is a lot 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.180
 lighter and with it we will get 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.980
 much faster flights 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.770
 As you can see, it has a front camera 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.210
 hd to 720p with which we can not only 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.860
 record videos and take quality photos 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.290
 but also retransmit videos in 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.360
 streaming 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.710
 and we are prepared to fly the 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.240
 ar.drone 2 for this we will have to 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.620
 connect the device to the network 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.630
 wireless that generates its own 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.940
 ar.drone thanks to her we will control the 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.190
 quadrocopters up to heights of 50 meters 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.210
 and using the free application are free 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.620
 flight 2 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.750
 we will manage the photos and videos 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:33.070
 we will get games we will update your 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.070
 firmware and also pilot it 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.610
 in your preferences we will adjust all 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.080
 the levels of the drone 2 even change 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.150
 his name choose where we want him to 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.890
 record on the usb not the ipad in this case 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.509
 or much more too 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.549
 we will define the flight sensitivity 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:49.690
 takeoff and landing-- get drone now 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.030
 we'll see that the takeoff landing 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.830
 is assisted by the software itself is 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.330
 convenient that at the beginning we use 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.100
 lower speeds to go 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.440
 controlling the response of argon to 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.850
 our movements 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.799
 we will also adjust levels for 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.840
 get that give drone answer just 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.369
 how we want 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.869
 an important button is the adjustment 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:09.670
 horizontal since that way 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.430
 recover stability after 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.810
 several flights and landings as we have 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.730
 said one of the strong points of the 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.260
 ardón is the amount of games even 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.849
 of augmented reality with which 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.560
 we can play and get much more game 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.000
 to our flights with him 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.739
 the application managed all the 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.250
 behavior and flight of this new 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.250
 ardón 2 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.750
 so to start flying alone 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.340
 we have to press the green button 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.260
 what we liked the most is the huge 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.880
 accuracy that is achieved with it and what 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.890
 well that responds to any movement 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.960
 either using the ipad accelerometer 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.830
 iphones or using the virtual joystick 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.830
 of the application 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.500
 especially in domestic flights is 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.720
 the more you realize how well you 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.400
 this new ar drone works with 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.140
 the new possibility to activate the flight 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.940
 absolute whatever the address 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.950
 where you tilt the phone or your 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.780
 device will respond the point of 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.370
 pilot's reference without losing the 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.470
 reference on the flight 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.069
 this will be very useful especially in flights 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.069
 exterior 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:25.450
 all right 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.950
 the ar.drone 2 you have it available in 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.700
 katyn dotcom as well as in our network 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.700
