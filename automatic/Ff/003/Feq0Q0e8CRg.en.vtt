 fabien bugeon this surfer who escaped 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.260
 death this summer at the meeting in a 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.260
 melee rather unprecedented with a shark 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.670
 hello fabien bugeon hello do not 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.830
 doubt you are really the man of 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.960
 summer and this good despite yourself since 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.820
 you had a nightmare that makes 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.779
 shudder everyone who listens to us a 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.940
 shark attack 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.530
 it was last August 5th in this 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.450
 attack you lost your hand 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.309
 right and part of your leg I 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.079
 specifies that you have taken very little 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.239
 word and so I thank you very much 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.489
 sincerely to do this this morning to 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.020
 rtl listeners 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.410
 tell us fabien bugeon the first 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.079
 shock 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.210
 the first attack is like a like 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.129
 a plane crash Saturday flashes 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.110
 what then you did not get to 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.360
 no I did not see happen yet I 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.309
 I was suspicious I was careful and the 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.649
 shock it would last a few half 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.049
 second so at the moment of shock 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.900
 you understand what is happening at the moment 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.640
 of shock when I actually see it does not have 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.369
 typed on the board he took me all of 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.480
 following the leg and took me away and that's 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.550
 when I saw 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.770
 the head and his eye that I understood 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.570
 yeah there I saw the same face death 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.820
 if they say and maybe it's for you 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.340
 this time it's going to be your 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.710
 tourcoing you have crossed his gaze 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.470
 yes I saw the age of view yes 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.620
 it's not it's not crossed sequenced 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.470
 look at costs and then and then down 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.760
 he was black and 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.720
 mine also had no problem on 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.970
 party was divested and the mouth 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.330
 lasts fifteen his jaw yielding you them 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:49.060
 still have the spirit yes oh yes I have them 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.320
 had in mind and I try to 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.720
 keep in mind because that's 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.580
 something unique rare enough to see 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.400
 but good for some people that 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.140
 seems completely a bit of madness 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.090
 but for me no pain had to be 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.940
 atrocious have no pain up 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.020
 to the edge I had no pain 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.610
 it happened at the edge I started to 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.729
 to have pains but not too much 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.880
 this gta is pretty calm 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.410
 you had to do the right thing or 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.320
 well like what was it all 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.410
 so you tell us this morning about 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.330
 rtl that despite the bites of the redhead 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.310
 who you after a part of your leg 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.230
 your hand you are in your flesh 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.420
 whose eyes you have met 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.120
 you did not feel the pain have 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.760
 no pain I had no pain 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.170
 no, how do you explain that to people? 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.240
 scientists explain me I know 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.500
 anything that's how that's life I do 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.570
 not sorry now I have it 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.470
 something else 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.980
 how did you manage to escape him 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.750
 fabien of the kind ben actually i took 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.100
 his gills I ripped him off 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.530
 gills with my left hand 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.239
 so there is a real fight between the 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.680
 shark and you down once he 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.840
 had gone to the camp were gone 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.310
 together underwater is a fight I 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.350
 do not know but in any case I knew 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.430
 his weak point so here I shot 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.950
 on it and it worked 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.620
 so in this clinch you've been 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.820
 lucid enough to catch his gills 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.830
 ah yes in the thrown body to body 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.690
 lucid because he look after my 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.540
 leg but I'm going to worry about 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.630
 his name gills that everyone had his 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.360
 technical what but precisely how that 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.720
 catch the gills of the shark and ben 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.610
 we know nothing 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.740
 I know where they are and I try to 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.570
 the state of thunder do not know it 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.720
 will spend a split second I know 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:31.760
 that at some point I grabbed him 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.980
 I 'm going to draw there I do not know I can 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.940
 not explain to you cgu of the exchange of 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:40.910
 the chance to be able to reach them and I 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.720
 I am not privy to it I was able to reflect and 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.870
 do the right thing 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.670
 if these tests were in open water where he 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.420
 would have brought me 2.3 meters deep 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.190
 would have been different 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.020
 that's what's extraordinary 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.780
 this lucidity you managed to 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.150
 keep 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.560
 I think all of this is getting ready 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.680
 since I started surfing 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.140
 maybe not from the beginning but I'm 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.430
 am always prepared for an attack but 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.750
 well there I was lucky because he 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.790
 took my leg but he would have taken 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.670
 my pond it was over there I have a 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.670
 incredible incredible luck since 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:16.459
 the accident and what you dreamed 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.650
 attak or the same nightmare that ds 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.720
 back in your dreams have never 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.180
 never never nightmare we come back to 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.700
 contrary even I try all the time 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.520
 to put me back in 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.170
 to review these images because because 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.730
 I do not want to leave them what you 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.120
 how were you in a state 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.190
 second 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.680
 I think I was in a second state 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.940
 but I still am 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.730
 maybe my life in a second state 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.990
 did not no no I'm fine 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.030
 lucid maybe I'm going to have a 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.650
 three-month gold crank back 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.650

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:52.070

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.350
