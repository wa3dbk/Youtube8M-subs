00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.840
 the world is full of water 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:13.170
 from space the earth looks like a 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.170
 planet 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:20.800
 but almost all the water is salty 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:23.410
 less than 3% is fresh water and only 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.790
 half of this is accessible and its 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:30.369
 distribution in the world is uneven the 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:34.140
 water is a finite resource what there is 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.140
 now is what there will always be 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.620
 but maybe for the first time in the 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.100
 history the global demand will surpass the 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.100
 offer 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.800
 the world population is around 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.500
 7 billion people and towards the 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.680
 2050 is expected to reach 9 thousand 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.680
 millions 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:02.940
 by then 70% of the total 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.190
 population will live in cities the 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.920
 cities occupy less than 1% of the 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:11.270
 territory but can consume up to 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.270
 20 percent of the water 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.060
 climate change causes floods 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.640
 and more frequent droughts altering the 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.680
 food production there are risks 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.220
 desalination when sea level rises 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.750
 the increase of bioenergy crops 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.159
 increases the pressure on water and 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.259
 as the world becomes more 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.259
 consumerist our diets demand 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:36.020
 foods that consume more water in the 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.090
 2030 the gap between supply and 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.380
 demand for fresh water may reach 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.380
 up to 40% 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.590
 this water gap is a potential 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.530
 conflict between users either by 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.560
 food energy the environment or the 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.560
 Health 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.820
 history shows that disputes 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.250
 have been resolved when people share 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.200
 the benefits of water this demands 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.260
 trust and cooperation on behalf of 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.330
 everyone involved work together and 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.440
 invest in the sustainable development of 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.440
 our water resources 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:19.599
 created in 1996 the world association 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.020
 for water is a network of more than 2700 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:24.150
 members around the world 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.530
 our broad global presence we 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.800
 allows to bring together the different 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.550
 interested governments civil society and 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.550
 the private sector 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.319
 from the local to the global we can 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.430
 share our experience and 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.379
 technical specialization 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.209
 and share the benefits of water 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:45.489
 requires an attitude of integrating 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:48.370
 cooperation between all sectors 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.799
 to promote economic efficiency the 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.519
 sustainability of ecosystems and 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.519
 Social equity 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.440
 in central asia we are the main network 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.730
 that brings together the countries that share the 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.730
 water resources of the region 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.640
 in africa we are working in the 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.769
 climate resilient development in 8 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:14.000
 countries and 4 watersheds 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:15.680
 cross-border in the Mediterranean 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.050
 we promote dialogue among those who 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.540
 they share the basin of the river drina 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.520
 in central europe we support the 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.100
 improvements in the management and development of 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.330
 the danube river basin shared by 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.330
 19 countries 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.560
 in latin america 'we promote the 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.440
 creation of governance frameworks for 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.840
 water at various levels 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.910
 and in china we are working with 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.070
 user associations to influence 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.900
 rural development policies and 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:49.060
 water saving 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.709
 these are just some examples of 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.230
 how we work through our 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:56.430
 associations and interests regions and more 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.430
 from 160 countries 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.770
 2013 is the international year of 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.330
 cooperation in the field of water what 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.760
 reminds us that water is a resource 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.460
 precious and vulnerable that should be 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.520
 efficiently managed and shared 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.650
 equitably 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.739
 We invite you to join our 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:22.500
 organization and thus contribute to that the 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.500
 world have the water assured
