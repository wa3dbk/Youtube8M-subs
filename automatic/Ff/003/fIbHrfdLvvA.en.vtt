around 550 grams the rear is under 700

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.960 
around 550 grams the rear is under 700
that's<00:01:46.890> got<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.130> make<00:01:47.280> them<00:01:47.399> just<00:01:47.579> about<00:01:47.850> the

lightest carbon crunches we've ever seen

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.219 
lightest carbon crunches we've ever seen
and<00:01:50.329> they<00:01:51.329> do<00:01:51.390> make<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.689> tremendous<00:01:51.960> difference

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
and they do make a tremendous difference

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.230 
and they do make a tremendous difference
