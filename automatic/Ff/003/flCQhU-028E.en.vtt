00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.740
THE GLASS

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.880
First of all, we’re going to start this tasting with the selection of the glass.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.680
Because it is important to chose wisely. 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.500
There are roughly as many glasses as there are wines.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.280
You have the white wine glass, red wine glass, rosé glass,

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.000
Burgundy’s glass, Champagne’s glass, Cognac’s glass, Whisky’s glass… 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.260
Wait a minute ! The most important, for a good start, is to have a wineglass.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.860
You need to take it by the foot, for wine’s respect, and for the technical aspect, 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.800
it enables to keep it at a good temperature and preserves its optimal taste. 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.680
THE VISUAL ASPECT

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.060
For the first step of tasting, we are going to talk about the look (the “robe”)

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.240
because it is important. Indeed, the physical aspect is what really matters.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.200
First, you will check the wine’s legs and its tears.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.720
Then you will look at the wine’s underwear ! ;)  

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.840
This so-called “robe”, it is just the wine’s color.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.820
For now, being able to tell if the wine is white, rosé, red, light or dark, gives already good indications.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.960
THE OLFACTORY SENSES: Le “nez”

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.980
Now we are going to talk about the “first nose” then about the “second nose”.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.160
It is important to detect olfactory sensations like phenol,

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.080
grass or cherry’s aroma, vanilla smell, undergrowth and many other things like this.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.280
Hum, too many big words!

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.900
“First nose”, “second nose”, the idea is just to smell the wine. 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.300
The“first nose”is when you smell it for the first time into the glass. 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.760
The “second nose” is once you have stirred your wine to enhance the olfactory sensations.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.180
For that, if you want to spare your shirt (mine in particular ! ^^), 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:50.540
avoid large movements and stir it softly like this.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.900
Now, you can smell it. 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.420
If it smells like wine, it is a good start ;).

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.240
Then, the little trick is to use deduction.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.220
If you don’t smell toasted notes, maybe you can smell fruits or spices… 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.860
Up to your imagination!

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.240
THE BOUQUET

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.300
It is finally time to discover the “bouquet”. 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.660
So I am going to taste it.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.500
We can taste oily flavors. It is a nice bouquet.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.540
I think it will age really good after 3 or 4 years in your cellar.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.800
The “bouquet”, the “bouquet”, fancy words again !

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.060
There you go : I have mine as well ! 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.460
The wine’s bouquet, it is just the wine’s flavor.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:42.880
Smart trick : take a small mouthful to get your taste buds used to the beverage.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.140
Now, it is THE tasting’s mouthful!

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.220
Classy, woman’s version ;) 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.460
Now, the most important is to know if you like it, if it caused good (or bad) sensations.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.560
If you winced, it is a bad sign lol.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.400
For me, I like this one!

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.300
THE LAST WORD

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.100
In fact, wine tasting is a little bit like bluff.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.100
The trick of the day : some useful sentences to deceive.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.040
You could say for example : this wine is smart and elegant;

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.820
the aromas reflect the olfactory sensations;

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.160
or better said : this wine reminds me of “the terroir”.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.040
To conclude: tasting is good, enjoying is better.
