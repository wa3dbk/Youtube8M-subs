00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.580 
sit there off the questions and put all
the<00:02:30.569> pictures<00:02:30.930> in<00:02:31.159> so<00:02:32.159> that<00:02:32.189> was<00:02:32.670> my<00:02:32.700> thought

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
the pictures in so that was my thought

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.750 
the pictures in so that was my thought
behind<00:02:34.590> this<00:02:35.040> book<00:02:35.430> and<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:37.680> way<00:02:37.890> I<00:02:37.920> attached

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
behind this book and the way I attached

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.830 
behind this book and the way I attached
the<00:02:38.970> coasters<00:02:39.569> to<00:02:39.870> each<00:02:40.019> other<00:02:40.260> is<00:02:40.610> I<00:02:41.840> use

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
the coasters to each other is I use

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.440 
the coasters to each other is I use
these<00:02:43.170> little<00:02:43.650> cable<00:02:44.340> ties<00:02:44.730> these<00:02:45.120> are<00:02:45.299> really

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
these little cable ties these are really

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.759 
these little cable ties these are really
skinny<00:02:45.870> ones<00:02:47.000> and<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.239> reason<00:02:48.629> I<00:02:48.959> decide<00:02:49.739> to

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
skinny ones and the reason I decide to

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:51.979 
skinny ones and the reason I decide to
use<00:02:50.220> these<00:02:50.489> is<00:02:50.760> because<00:02:51.060> i<00:02:51.390> couldn't<00:02:51.720> find

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
use these is because i couldn't find

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.130 
use these is because i couldn't find
like<00:02:52.560> a<00:02:52.590> metal<00:02:53.480> binding<00:02:54.480> ring<00:02:54.720> or<00:02:54.930> something

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
like a metal binding ring or something

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.869 
like a metal binding ring or something
that<00:02:55.769> was<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.670> size<00:02:56.879> i<00:02:57.120> wanted<00:02:57.629> so<00:02:58.700> when<00:02:59.700> these

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
that was the size i wanted so when these

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.210 
that was the size i wanted so when these
are<00:03:00.090> closed<00:03:00.540> on<00:03:01.200> here<00:03:01.709> they're<00:03:01.950> probably

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
are closed on here they're probably

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.020 
are closed on here they're probably
about<00:03:02.970> a<00:03:03.030> half<00:03:03.299> an<00:03:03.540> inch<00:03:03.690> in<00:03:04.530> diameter<00:03:05.310> I<00:03:05.790> don't

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
about a half an inch in diameter I don't

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.069 
about a half an inch in diameter I don't
know<00:03:06.120> if<00:03:06.180> you<00:03:06.299> can<00:03:06.480> see<00:03:06.720> that<00:03:08.420> but<00:03:09.420> that's

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
know if you can see that but that's

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.349 
know if you can see that but that's
about<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.680> size<00:03:10.859> i<00:03:11.099> wanted<00:03:11.579> and<00:03:11.760> this<00:03:11.970> was<00:03:12.180> the

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
about the size i wanted and this was the

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.020 
about the size i wanted and this was the
only<00:03:12.389> thing<00:03:12.780> i<00:03:12.930> could<00:03:13.079> think<00:03:13.230> of<00:03:13.639> that<00:03:14.639> would

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
only thing i could think of that would

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.520 
only thing i could think of that would
serve<00:03:15.329> this<00:03:15.510> purpose<00:03:15.750> so<00:03:17.750> when<00:03:18.750> I<00:03:18.780> attached

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
serve this purpose so when I attached

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.589 
serve this purpose so when I attached
them<00:03:19.889> I<00:03:20.129> laid<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:20.579> coasters<00:03:21.060> out<00:03:21.239> and<00:03:21.480> I<00:03:21.569> just

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
them I laid the coasters out and I just

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.390 
them I laid the coasters out and I just
made<00:03:21.959> sure<00:03:21.989> that<00:03:22.319> i<00:03:22.379> alternated<00:03:23.069> the

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
made sure that i alternated the

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.099 
made sure that i alternated the
direction<00:03:23.879> of<00:03:24.359> the<00:03:25.079> cable<00:03:25.530> tie<00:03:25.739> so<00:03:26.129> that<00:03:26.340> the

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:27.109 
direction of the cable tie so that the

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:31.430 
direction of the cable tie so that the
this<00:03:28.109> little<00:03:28.440> part<00:03:28.980> that<00:03:29.190> keeps<00:03:29.370> it<00:03:29.609> shut<00:03:30.440> one

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
this little part that keeps it shut one

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.990 
this little part that keeps it shut one
would<00:03:31.650> be<00:03:31.680> on<00:03:31.919> this<00:03:32.069> side<00:03:32.280> one<00:03:32.579> would<00:03:32.760> be<00:03:32.910> on

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
would be on this side one would be on

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.550 
would be on this side one would be on
this<00:03:33.150> side<00:03:33.359> the<00:03:33.660> next<00:03:33.900> one<00:03:34.019> would<00:03:34.109> be<00:03:34.169> on<00:03:34.379> this

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
this side the next one would be on this

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.879 
this side the next one would be on this
side<00:03:34.769> so<00:03:34.980> that<00:03:35.760> when<00:03:36.480> you<00:03:36.660> fold<00:03:37.910> the<00:03:38.910> book<00:03:39.889> it

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
side so that when you fold the book it

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:44.680 
side so that when you fold the book it
closes<00:03:41.459> nicely<00:03:42.000> and<00:03:42.239> then<00:03:42.989> all<00:03:43.230> I<00:03:43.260> did<00:03:43.590> was<00:03:43.620> tie

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
closes nicely and then all I did was tie

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.569 
closes nicely and then all I did was tie
ribbons<00:03:45.690> onto<00:03:46.319> the<00:03:46.410> cable<00:03:46.620> ties<00:03:47.010> so<00:03:47.370> that

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
ribbons onto the cable ties so that

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:52.009 
ribbons onto the cable ties so that
it'll<00:03:47.849> cover<00:03:48.889> this<00:03:49.889> little<00:03:50.310> closure<00:03:51.269> piece<00:03:51.780> of
