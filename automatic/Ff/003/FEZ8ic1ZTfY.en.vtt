00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.299
 hey it's going to be this good path that 

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:07.819
 has many alternatives but that is going to 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.559
 to be giving us an idea that will play 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:12.170
 chivas with de nigris ahead marquez 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.480
 new dices is left behind and fabian where 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.830
 it was going you can play where it is 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.830
 sanchez in short 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.359
 José Ramón has already confirmed the low 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.099
 of Luis Ernesto Perez who is going to 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.829
 play in the team of querétaro 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:36.920
 then the situation would be from 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.570
 Then I could play with three or 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.340
 attack elements in this tournament 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.300
 when it is not yet rough sea is 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:47.120
 rafael marquez lugo is the player 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.100
 Miguel Sabah and there is also the other side 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.579
 On the other side, good atmosphere Miguel 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.470
 sabah giving nigris and this and now 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.480
 we have good because there organized the 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.460
 attack on the other hand in the center of 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.559
 field is jesus el chapo sanchez and 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.989
 is also Fabian frame is also 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.430
 considered chatón enríquez with another 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.990
 of the players that could be in the 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.580
 midfield and of course what 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.780
 convinced navas a moment benjamin 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.780
 Galindo is looking for an offensive team 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.000
 José Ramón has already confirmed the low 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.740
 of Luis Ernesto Perez who is going to 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.470
 play in the team of querétaro 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.140
 then the situation would be from 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.210
 Then I could play with three 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.979
 attack elements in this tournament 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.940
 when it is not even braver is 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:34.280
 rafael marquez lugo is the player 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.810
 Miguel Sabah and there is also the other one 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.060
 side on the other side 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.060
 obviously with miguel sabah aldo from 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.369
 nigris and this and we have good then 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.990
 there organized the attack on the other hand 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.850
 in the center of the field is Jesus the 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.130
 Chapo Sanchez and is also frame 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.869
 Fabián is also considered the 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.100
 chatón enríquez with another of the 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.630
 players that could be in the 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.220
 midfield and of course what 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.679
 convinced navas a moment benjamin 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.209
 Galindo is looking for a very offensive team 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:01.539
 well looking for equipment and we have a 

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:01.539
 delay
