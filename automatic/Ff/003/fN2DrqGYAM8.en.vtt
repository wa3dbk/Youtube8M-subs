00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.490
 hello all good 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.510
 then at this moment be on the street 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.450
 pier in san francisco 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.960
 and I've been taking pictures for several hours 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.960
 the street 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:35.620
 and this is good photography in the 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:38.379
 I basically go with my camera and 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.920
 I take pictures of interesting things but 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:46.420
 mainly of people is something that 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:49.780
 it requires a certain boldness 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:55.239
 since sometimes people can get 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:58.920
 with you and good when that happens 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:01.720
 it's better to just smile and 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.239
 good if they ask you for explanations 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.790
 just tell the truth that you are 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.240
 photographer and you like to take pictures in 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.240
 the street 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.140
 no then that 's what to me always 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:31.110
 It worked for me I do not lie 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:34.140
 because I think it's good that creates at the end 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.479
 a distrust of all food 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.960
 photographic or the community of 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:43.800
 photographers not so generally 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.880
 when I'm taking pictures on the street 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.759
 What I do is 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.880
 well first I pretend I'm 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.729
 taking pictures of something different by 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.750
 example if I see someone interesting 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.020
 let's say he wears a hat 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:02.770
 interesting and I want to do I love him 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:07.990
 take a picture of him or what I do 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:10.209
 it is before I focus my objective in the place 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.220
 where I know this is going to be called 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.780
 they are foxen jose a 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:19.280
 will not be focused by areas not 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:23.840
 so nothing then and then I wait for 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:27.390
 enter this area where is 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.500
 focused on the goal and then I do the 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.500
 photo background 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:41.950
 then at this time 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:44.200
 I 'm not going to make more pictures because 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:49.540
 in low light 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:53.210
 but with my new camera that is, I have the 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.610
 camera no longer exists 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.880
 I can take pictures even at night 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.400
 but nothing I'm a bit exhausted and for 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:06.629
 that 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.629
 I think just going back to the car 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:23.940
 and back home I live in palo alto that 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:27.930
 is more or less one hour san 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.460
 francisco not in roda or my car and good 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:36.450
 these people are interesting because 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:38.220
 take them to a beautiful photo 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.200
 sometimes man when one is not 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.860
 prepared there was a very couple 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:47.310
 pretty and but the same with this light 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:50.180
 with the lack of it I think there would be 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.180
 been difficult not 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:08.750
 and tell you when I'm doing 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:11.720
 I usually go to public places where 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:15.980
 There are many people and many tourists do not 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:18.739
 because just the same, people do not get 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.500
 he is not offended so much when there are many 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.270
 tourists out there either because I like 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.400
 they will not think that I am a tourist 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.880
 anyone not 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:32.090
 and I already have all the speech prepared not 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.520
 lies to tell you what they did not do 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:38.259
 something 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.879
 that of lying but nothing or a little and 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:42.879
 I want to talk a little more about the 

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:45.550
 strategies of how to take pictures of the 

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:48.669
 people on the street good first I do not 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:52.560
 I'm using targets that I photo him 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:55.200
 I know how you say that in English and 16 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.710
 I do not like it at all because that 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.990
 separates from the subject not what I do 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.919
 mainly is to use such an objective 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:08.240
 like the one you're seeing right now 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:08.240
 which is 28 millimeters 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:20.479
 I'm basically going 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:22.580
 ie I approach people and good I 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:25.699
 photos but do not mean not in plan and 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:30.159
 respectful I would also like to talk 

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:30.159
 with you a little about the laws 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:34.970
 good 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:37.680
 of photography in the public to whom we 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:40.950
 basically when you're in a place 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:43.440
 public no one has the right to tell you 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:45.810
 that you can not take a picture so 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.210
 well many many times people do not 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:51.660
 is aware of this and can get 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:53.370
 with you they tell you that yes no no no no 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:56.550
 can you take a picture this is 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:58.920
 is prohibited or I have not given permission 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:01.160
 Boy, I do not have to give you 

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.160
 permission 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:12.770
 but nothing I do not walk with this attitude or 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:16.009
 be there are photographers that equal that is 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:19.580
 they say they say like 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:22.099
 anda because I'm going to do everything 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.979
 want so I do not walk like this when the 

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:27.400
 people ask me good things always in 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:29.960
 sympathetic plan no 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:33.920
 well nothing 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:37.910
 here there was a concert tonight 

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:41.870
 Well I guess because albert's good 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:45.140
 there was still there that always confuses me 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:50.260
 Well, I hope you liked it 

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:54.500

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:57.260
 I know that my friend youtuber kerby online 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:59.870
 which always makes videos on the street and 

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:03.140
 nothing because they showed themselves to show them a 

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:06.650
 little of my city do not come 

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:08.980
