00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 they played that had been so tasty nor 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:08.490
 cook so fun this is cooking 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.389
 tower but very hungry me 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.990
 I found 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:16.460
 I knew that cooking is a delirium 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.460
 I want to help 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.760
 hello and welcome to cook your fridge 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.590
 about the day of the dead and for this 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.590
 occasion we are going to prepare pan de muerto 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.100
 I'm going to start by putting the flour in a 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.110
 bowl and let's be a source you have to 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.510
 to be as if it were a crater and in 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.550
 we're going to add the rest 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.650
 of the ingredients always first 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.240
 let's start with the ingredients 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:59.280
 dry and then we will add the 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.280
 liquid ingredients works eyes 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.820
 the evil 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.500
 Y 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.840
 very well 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.110
 I already have all the ingredients to 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.910
 exception of the yeast that I put it with 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.349
 a little hot water for this 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.170
 will help us to have a fermentation 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.810
 faster now what I'm going to do is 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.599
 start mixing the ingredients that 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.940
 they are in the crater grabbing little by little 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.769
 the flour from the edges so that it 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.360
 go forming the dough and not cost us 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.940
 so much work that everything looks good 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.920
 mixed and good before you get to the 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:48.860
 shore that was where I put the salt I'm going to 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.860
 add the yeast with the hot water 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.660
 do not 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.830
 I already have a more or less homogeneous mass 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.780
 and pretty elastic the ways to let 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.160
 stand 40 minutes in the refrigerator 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.160
 to give it the first fermentation 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.579
 and the first fermentation is going 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:40.590
 to give again a mass nothing faster 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:40.590
 and we are going to start forming the loaves 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:54.959
 to give it the form it is important that 

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:57.620
 Press a little with your hand and do 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.620
 circles 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.580
 to form the bones that the bread carries 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:15.400
 we take a smaller portion of dough 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.720
 and we are going to do as if it were a tube and 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.310
 then with your fingers we are going to 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.700
 press so that the shape of the 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.700
 bones 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.750
 I feel like I have 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.280
 combat 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.240
 but good 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.650
 he does not want 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.840
 it already has the shape our bread now what 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.090
 let's let ferment approximately 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.130
 about 10 minutes above the oven where 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.440
 it's hot and then we're going to put it 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.870
 baked to sew it has been delayed 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:05.520
 approximately about 40 minutes we want 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.520
 that our bread is lightly browned 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.280
 ah 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.570
 finally melt butter for 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.050
 varnish the bread and is trans for example 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.050
