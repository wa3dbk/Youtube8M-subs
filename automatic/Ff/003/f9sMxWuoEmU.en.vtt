so<00:02:41.370> we<00:02:41.490> gotta<00:02:41.640> we<00:02:42.390> gotta<00:02:42.540> work<00:02:42.690> on<00:02:42.810> that<00:02:42.840> a

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
so we gotta we gotta work on that a

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.690 
so we gotta we gotta work on that a
little<00:02:43.020> bit<00:02:43.110> you<00:02:43.260> know<00:02:43.290> and<00:02:43.410> stay<00:02:43.590> sharper<00:02:44.010> we

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
little bit you know and stay sharper we

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.920 
little bit you know and stay sharper we
know<00:02:44.790> match<00:02:45.000> their<00:02:45.180> intensity<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.599> first<00:02:45.780> 10

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930

minutes i think we cruise out 30 made
the<00:02:48.150> game<00:02:48.270> a<00:02:48.300> little<00:02:48.330> difficult<00:02:48.810> for

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
the game a little difficult for

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.390 
the game a little difficult for
ourselves

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
ourselves

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.860 
ourselves
but<00:02:49.519> you<00:02:49.610> know<00:02:49.730> at<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:50.150> end<00:02:50.180> we<00:02:50.390> still<00:02:50.569> on<00:02:50.720> a

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:10.909 
effort was there but still the execution

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:13.300

the win I play some great attacking

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:18.309 
the win I play some great attacking
soccer<00:03:16.090> for<00:03:17.090> about<00:03:17.299> you<00:03:17.569> know<00:03:17.599> first<00:03:18.079> time<00:03:18.260> in

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
soccer for about you know first time in

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:20.080 
soccer for about you know first time in
Estill<00:03:18.680> while<00:03:18.799> he<00:03:18.920> going<00:03:19.159> after<00:03:19.189> that<00:03:19.549> really

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
Estill while he going after that really

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.089 
Estill while he going after that really
really<00:03:20.209> nice<00:03:20.390> stuff<00:03:20.569> and<00:03:20.930> even<00:03:21.680> still<00:03:22.069> the

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 
really nice stuff and even still the

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:23.500 
really nice stuff and even still the
second<00:03:22.400> half<00:03:22.549> but<00:03:22.760> the<00:03:22.819> with<00:03:23.060> the<00:03:23.180> lead<00:03:23.329> we

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
second half but the with the lead we

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.119 
second half but the with the lead we
were<00:03:23.659> attacking<00:03:24.319> well<00:03:24.620> but<00:03:24.829> I<00:03:24.859> think<00:03:25.040> we're

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:25.129 
were attacking well but I think we're

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:27.399 
were attacking well but I think we're
little<00:03:25.280> bit<00:03:25.370> loose<00:03:25.489> defending<00:03:26.079> and<00:03:27.079> therefore

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:27.409 
little bit loose defending and therefore

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:28.750 
little bit loose defending and therefore
they<00:03:27.620> crept<00:03:27.799> back<00:03:27.920> into<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.250> game<00:03:28.370> and<00:03:28.579> it

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
they crept back into the game and it

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.449 
they crept back into the game and it
shouldn't<00:03:29.060> have<00:03:29.269> happened<00:03:29.930> that<00:03:29.959> way<00:03:30.079> but

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
shouldn't have happened that way but

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.440 
shouldn't have happened that way but
give<00:03:31.459> them<00:03:31.609> credit<00:03:31.730> she<00:03:31.970> have<00:03:32.060> good<00:03:32.180> attacking

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
give them credit she have good attacking

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.089 
give them credit she have good attacking
players<00:03:32.780> but<00:03:33.109> I<00:03:33.139> think<00:03:33.349> we<00:03:33.440> were<00:03:33.590> losing<00:03:33.889> our

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.099 
players but I think we were losing our

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:36.429 
players but I think we were losing our
concentration<00:03:34.670> at<00:03:34.760> times<00:03:34.939> and<00:03:35.439> therefore

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:36.439 
concentration at times and therefore

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:37.720 
concentration at times and therefore
they<00:03:36.590> took<00:03:36.950> advantage<00:03:37.129> of<00:03:37.280> their<00:03:37.400> chances

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
they took advantage of their chances

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.030 
they took advantage of their chances
