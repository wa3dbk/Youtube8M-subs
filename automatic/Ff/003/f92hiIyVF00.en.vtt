00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:14.090
 hello everybody is kiwi and fair 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.060
 back to moder warfare 3 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:19.790
 this time not with a moab not with the 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.919
 my usual ice core but we'll talk later 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:25.399
 of the match or better of the two games 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:28.099
 that you have a background today 

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:30.259
 because then I want first 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.880
 clarify a matter concerning 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:33.559
 to the last video because I really had it 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.890
 I have tried so many problems loading it 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:39.230
 4 5 times and the problem was that youtube 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.480
 he didn't tell me at the beginning of 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:45.019
 uploading is not good video not 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.519
 he told me at the end and with the 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:50.510
 connection that lately is doing 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:51.800
 a bit crap I got a point where 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.659
 it took about three hours 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.519
 four hours to upload a video that is 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:58.969
 a crazy thing for ten minutes 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:00.829
 of video and therefore as you know the video is 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.710
 arrived late but it's not over here 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:07.030
 because the downloaded video was 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.440
 charged at night without my knowledge is 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.900
 practically untitled without 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.600
 description without the thumbnail 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:18.650
 personalized and therefore obviously it is 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:21.380
 been poorly displayed and I ask for help a 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.300
 you especially to all those who are 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.590
 my writings that wish to follow me 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:29.120
 because I clarified some things about it 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.710
 on the video still before the one on 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.830
 inactive subscribers if you remember 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.790
 Here because 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.170
 I absolutely didn't want to leave 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.540
 let's say some things I wanted 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.180
 to clarify everything in short with all the 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.140
 my writings and please go to 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.600
 see why a video really 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.610
 important and above all there are also 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.650
 some news both on my channel and in the 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.400
 video so you will find it both in 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:57.880
 description that up here surely 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:00.610
 or even on my facebook page e 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.730
 surely you are wondering but who 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.120
 mode is this because maybe someone 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.310
 of you 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:10.780
 will have already seen it will have already recognized it 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:13.240
 however, let's say and not even played because 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.340
 I know that on the consoles is not present 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.770
 this kind of mode then his 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:22.270
 gun game name that translated into Italian 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:24.850
 it would be the game of weapons and how 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.790
 you will understand i guess it consists in 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:31.360
 kill a person with a weapon that you 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:34.720
 gives the game and whenever it kills one 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.940
 person the degree is not that dear 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.820
 of the hard moment however it changes the weapon no 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:43.209
 and if instead I stabbed as I did 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.850
 in this moment you will reduce the degree of 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:48.160
 enemy so it's pretty nice like 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.200
 modality and above all because you 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.050
 lets take insults like in 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:59.210
 this moment and joking 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:01.810
 and beautiful as a modality because how 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:05.740
 you will understand there are no bonuses 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:09.730
 details or particular weapons 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:12.170
 dead rewards akimbo grenade launcher 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.120
 camper on ebay camper you can 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:18.500
 find those yes those don't miss 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:21.440
 but I was just thinking about starting 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:25.280
 a new series on these new modes 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:28.390
 that we pc gamers compared to those who 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:31.460
 play on a console we own for 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:35.900
 in short, show them to those who do not 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:37.940
 they can play and obviously these don't 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.610
 will necessarily live commentaries because 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:45.110
 the live as I said before I prefer 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:47.090
 be more spontaneous fun to do 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.070
 see how I really echo while 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.170
 in the comments of how this is 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.720
 above all they are commented for 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:58.640
 inform give advice ask 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.959
 opinions here and then as you will have 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.650
 noticed you too 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:05.780
 I open a small parenthesis because 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:09.170
 despite the final score of these 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:12.320
 matches was obviously not 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.360
 extraordinary because once arrived 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:18.290
 once the killing is done with each 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:20.600
 weapon then you won no more than 20 25 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.480
 you can't do it if you have noticed 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:26.240
 the last weapon is the already tissue here that is 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.910
 a bit is quite complicated to make a 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.430
 killing with that weapon there anyway a 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.690
 I forgot to tell you that it is 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.910
 practically an all against all is not 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.760
 a team deathmatch like you 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:43.090
 alone against everyone 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:47.230
 as you can see there is a kind of 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:49.640
 which is said there is a kind of logic 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.470
 in weapons because at the beginning there are 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:54.830
 maybe all the machine guns then there 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:58.660
 assault rifles are the snipers leaks 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:01.940
 m25 as the last weapon the already velin e 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:04.010
 nothing anyway like I said yes like 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.320
 that we pc gamers had some modalities 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:08.510
 that on the consoles are not present 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.340
 especially in dedicated servers that 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.730
 can be can be entered 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.740
 mode at will and so I was in fact 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:18.740
 thinking about starting this series on 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:20.300
 my channel where I will take modes that do not 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.800
 of course there are no consoles 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.360
 because they could be modalities also 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.640
 how to search and destroy neighborhood 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:29.480
 general however modalities that are seen 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:31.910
 recently it is mostly in the videos 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:35.330
 of the most recognized youtubers more 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:37.580
 followed here where especially on call of 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:40.400
 Duties tend to always play the same 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.590
 modality therefore that I know domain or 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.450
 killing confirmed only because le 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:48.050
 matches last a long time or area of 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:49.670
 I throw to go for some clips and I think 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:53.630
 that this thing is interesting and everything 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:55.580
 added is also because to be a 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:57.560
 they catch on to get that touch a 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.700
 little bit of originality in more respect 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.070
 to the others 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.710
 tell me in the comments if this suits you 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:07.040
 what if you like this idea if you have 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.310
 a way to advise me above all 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:10.860
 boys 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.600
 propose your ideas for the next one 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.130
 video that is not that I noticed though 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:18.270
 so many ideas that I leave to decide 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:20.520
 to you model f23 battlefield live 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.680
 nuclear moab commentaries choose you 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.670
 even for today as an inter is over 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.100
 go in peace 

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:27.480
 we will see the clip at the next video 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:30.680
 bonus is coming 

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.680
 Hi everyone
