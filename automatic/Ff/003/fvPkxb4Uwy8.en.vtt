00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.380
 Now we learn not to create 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.620
 the mailbox above is known in the mail 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.329
 Yandex service 

00:00:09.329 --> 00:00:11.789
 in fact it is not difficult at all 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:14.419
 very simple you even imagine 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:16.579
 can not how much 

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:18.549
 in order to create new ones 

00:00:18.549 --> 00:00:19.789
 mailboxes 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.819
 we will need to find on the site 

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:25.859
 Yandex rub problem and the efforts of the site you 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.859
 will see small mailboxes 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.609
 because you don't have a mailbox yet 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:33.649
 it is necessary to click the link 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:35.840
 get mailboxes 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.750
 then 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.030
 registration page will open 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.250
 let's do the first step of two to get us started 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.620
 need to fill 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.390
 form that appeared with its data 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.630
 name and surname indicates his 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.420
 after that we select login 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.950
 by default banks will suggest 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.450
 possible login options 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.120
 so that you canâ€™t choose from 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.949
 of what is there 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.649
 or you can think up and login 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:05.110
 by myself 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.110
 new for convenience and save time if 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.740
 you are not fundamentally 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.960
 mailbox name 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.090
 I recommend to get you logins 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.060
 from the proposed options 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.509
 although of course you can calling 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.170
 type on the keyboard that option which 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.600
 You'll like it 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.409
 but note that network users 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:24.860
 lots of 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.260
 so liked 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.570
 option may be just Kazan 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.200
 so have to work hard with 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.850
 inventing possible names 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.130
 so the easiest of course 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.630
 use the hint program 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.680
 for example, select one of the proposed 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.110
 options 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.520
 tramp pupkin 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.690
 He's free 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.930
 what did you need it 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.260
 and now your inbox will be called 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.259
 Vasya Pupkin 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.460
 Yandex rub 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.050
 the next step will be called for those buttons 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.049
 farther 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.990
 you have to come up with a password 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.420
 invent 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.720
 it can be in Russian or Latin 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.110
 letters and numbers you type the password 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.109
 Confirm password again 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:15.089
 and the role do not forget everyone somewhere 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:18.089
 be sure to write 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.179
 it began 

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:22.459
 not once needed 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.799
 now it is necessary 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:27.799
 election to a secret question 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:30.150
 i.e. it could be a maiden name 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.599

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.080
 zip code 355000 grandmothers your mates 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:38.419
 school and even your own question 

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:40.229
 the answer to which is more than you 

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:41.809
 nobody knows 

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:44.249

 if not then just skip this field 

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:57.919
 Telephone number 

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:00.649
 you can specify but as you can see this field is the same 

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:02.319
 not necessary 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:03.879
 so you can phone either 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:05.249
