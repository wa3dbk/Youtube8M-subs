00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
well my wife and I have always been

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.940 
well my wife and I have always been
collectors<00:00:09.349> she<00:00:10.349> was<00:00:10.500> to<00:00:11.540> collect<00:00:12.950> children's

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
collectors she was to collect children's

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.000 
collectors she was to collect children's
glassware<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:14.880> miniature<00:00:15.540> lamps<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:16.619> I'd<00:00:16.800> go

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
glassware and miniature lamps and I'd go

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.120 
glassware and miniature lamps and I'd go
along<00:00:17.100> with<00:00:17.490> her<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:18.740> that<00:00:19.740> would<00:00:19.949> have

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
along with her and that would have

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.630 
along with her and that would have
having<00:00:20.730> nothing<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.270> do<00:00:21.449> so<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.810> decided<00:00:22.350> that

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
having nothing to do so I decided that

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.759 
having nothing to do so I decided that
if<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:23.850> thought<00:00:24.269> wanting<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.600> save<00:00:24.840> my<00:00:25.080> soul<00:00:25.350> I'd

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
if I thought wanting to save my soul I'd

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.939 
if I thought wanting to save my soul I'd
better<00:00:26.039> start<00:00:26.340> collecting<00:00:26.849> myself<00:00:27.420> so<00:00:28.380> that's

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
better start collecting myself so that's

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.640 
better start collecting myself so that's
when<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.910> really<00:00:30.779> started<00:00:31.080> collecting<00:00:31.380> your

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
when I really started collecting your

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.389 
when I really started collecting your
Stein's

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
Stein's

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.880 
Stein's
I've<00:00:33.000> been<00:00:33.210> collecting<00:00:33.450> Stein's<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.469> guess<00:00:34.710> now

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
I've been collecting Stein's I guess now

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.639 
I've been collecting Stein's I guess now
about<00:00:35.100> 60<00:00:35.640> years<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.329> I'm<00:00:36.899> said<00:00:37.230> I'm<00:00:37.350> still

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
about 60 years and I'm said I'm still

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.260 
about 60 years and I'm said I'm still
collecting<00:00:38.660> Stein<00:00:39.739> history<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:41.610> was<00:00:41.820> so

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
collecting Stein history it was so

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.130 
collecting Stein history it was so
interesting<00:00:42.750> for<00:00:43.469> for<00:00:44.010> example<00:00:44.100> now<00:00:45.140> the

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
interesting for for example now the

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.290 
interesting for for example now the
first<00:00:46.440> time<00:00:46.890> was<00:00:47.309> was<00:00:47.789> created<00:00:48.710> because<00:00:49.710> of

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
first time was was created because of

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.810 
first time was was created because of
the<00:00:51.300> bubonic<00:00:51.539> plague<00:00:51.899> in<00:00:52.530> Europe<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.190> matter<00:00:53.699> of

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
the bubonic plague in Europe a matter of

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.760 
the bubonic plague in Europe a matter of
fact<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.480> Germans<00:00:55.640> passed<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.850> law<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.780> the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
fact the Germans passed a law that the

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.939 
fact the Germans passed a law that the
only<00:00:59.359> vessel<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.750> could<00:01:00.930> drink<00:01:01.170> from<00:01:01.260> had<00:01:01.800> to

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
only vessel you could drink from had to

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.850 
only vessel you could drink from had to
have<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.190> lid<00:01:02.879> on<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.660> that's<00:01:04.320> how<00:01:04.500> that's

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
have a lid on it so that's how that's

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.100 
have a lid on it so that's how that's
how<00:01:05.070> they<00:01:06.060> got<00:01:06.240> started

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
how they got started

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.140 
how they got started
most<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.799> Stein's<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.340> guess<00:01:08.909> I've

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
most of the Stein's that I guess I've

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.910 
most of the Stein's that I guess I've
got<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.360> have<00:01:10.159> probably<00:01:11.159> are<00:01:11.490> in<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.530> maybe

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.880 

1895<00:01:16.920> 1910<00:01:17.729> but<00:01:18.060> some<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.049> my<00:01:19.170> signs<00:01:19.439> go<00:01:19.710> back

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
1895 1910 but some of my signs go back

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.969 
1895 1910 but some of my signs go back
to<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.189> 1500<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.689> most<00:01:21.960> important<00:01:22.770> part

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
to the 1500 the most important part

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.140 
to the 1500 the most important part
about<00:01:23.220> collecting<00:01:24.119> science<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:25.549> there's<00:01:26.549> so

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
about collecting science is there's so

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.249 
about collecting science is there's so
much<00:01:27.299> arc<00:01:27.890> to<00:01:28.890> Stein's<00:01:29.570> I<00:01:30.570> don't<00:01:31.020> think

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
much arc to Stein's I don't think

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.740 
much arc to Stein's I don't think
there's<00:01:31.439> anything<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:32.250> was<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:33.119> can't<00:01:33.420> find

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
there's anything that was you can't find

early signs that the lie that I have was

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.850 
early signs that the lie that I have was
given<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.619> me<00:01:43.770> by<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.040> friend<00:01:44.189> who<00:01:45.590> picked<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.740> up
