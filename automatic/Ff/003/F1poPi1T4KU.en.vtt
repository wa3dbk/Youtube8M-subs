00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
this video actually i don't think i

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.480 
this video actually i don't think i
recorded<00:01:32.410> i<00:01:32.440> think<00:01:32.620> my<00:01:32.710> computer<00:01:33.040> messes<00:01:33.370> up

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
recorded i think my computer messes up

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.910 
recorded i think my computer messes up
and<00:01:33.640> I<00:01:33.700> don't<00:01:33.760> record<00:01:34.120> it<00:01:34.240> but<00:01:34.960> he<00:01:35.020> dies<00:01:35.230> twice

and I don't record it but he dies twice

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.860 
and I don't record it but he dies twice
because<00:01:36.430> of<00:01:36.820> you<00:01:37.060> can<00:01:37.180> die<00:01:37.330> twice<00:01:37.570> as<00:01:37.840> a

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:37.870 
because of you can die twice as a

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.830 
because of you can die twice as a
phantom<00:01:38.320> because<00:01:38.500> of<00:01:38.650> that<00:01:38.770> skill<00:01:39.100> and<00:01:39.910> yeah

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
phantom because of that skill and yeah

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.690

multiple word world don't have very high

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.430 
multiple word world don't have very high
population<00:03:44.550> so<00:03:44.730> next<00:03:44.940> on<00:03:45.260> fuses<00:03:46.260> them

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
population so next on fuses them

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.400 
population so next on fuses them
together<00:03:46.739> and<00:03:46.980> I<00:03:48.019> characters<00:03:49.019> in<00:03:49.170> each<00:03:49.260> of

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
together and I characters in each of

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.370 
together and I characters in each of
those<00:03:49.500> worlds<00:03:49.739> can<00:03:50.040> play<00:03:50.220> together<00:03:50.370> and

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
those worlds can play together and

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.460 
those worlds can play together and
cohabit<00:03:52.670> cohabitate<00:03:53.780> cohabitate<00:03:54.780> co<00:03:55.019> habitat

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
cohabit cohabitate cohabitate co habitat

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.160 
cohabit cohabitate cohabitate co habitat
cohabitate<00:03:56.190> i<00:03:56.430> think<00:03:56.730> that's<00:03:56.880> it<00:03:57.170> they

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
cohabitate i think that's it they

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.810 
cohabitate i think that's it they
basically<00:03:58.500> just<00:03:58.890> merge<00:03:59.310> the<00:03:59.459> server<00:03:59.670> so

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
basically just merge the server so

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.060 
basically just merge the server so
everyone<00:04:00.120> can<00:04:00.239> play<00:04:00.330> with<00:04:00.540> each<00:04:00.660> other<00:04:00.840> and<00:04:01.650> if

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
everyone can play with each other and if

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.130 
everyone can play with each other and if
you<00:04:02.160> had<00:04:02.280> if<00:04:02.580> you<00:04:02.610> had<00:04:02.700> characters<00:04:03.150> on<00:04:03.390> Zenith

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
you had if you had characters on Zenith

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.130 
you had if you had characters on Zenith
and<00:04:04.260> I<00:04:04.769> had<00:04:04.920> characters<00:04:05.370> on<00:04:05.519> Glacia<00:04:05.900> then<00:04:06.900> we

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
and I had characters on Glacia then we

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.780 
and I had characters on Glacia then we
could<00:04:07.290> play<00:04:07.410> together<00:04:07.470> and<00:04:07.980> whatever<00:04:08.580> but

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
could play together and whatever but

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.670 
could play together and whatever but
yeah<00:04:09.450> that's<00:04:09.600> what<00:04:09.780> a<00:04:09.810> server<00:04:10.080> merge<00:04:10.260> and

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
yeah that's what a server merge and

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.460 
yeah that's what a server merge and
