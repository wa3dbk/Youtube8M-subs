the different types of white cells we

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.360 
the different types of white cells we
also<00:00:52.670> identify<00:00:53.450> bacteria<00:00:54.170> through<00:00:54.890> there<00:00:55.100> and

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
also identify bacteria through there and

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.950 
also identify bacteria through there and
we<00:00:55.610> do<00:00:55.790> fecal<00:00:56.180> worm<00:00:56.780> egg<00:00:56.960> counts<00:00:57.470> on<00:00:58.960> feces

we do fecal worm egg counts on feces
that<00:01:00.170> owners<00:01:00.620> might<00:01:00.830> send<00:01:01.130> in<00:01:01.310> so<00:01:02.060> they<00:01:02.270> know

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
that owners might send in so they know

a lot from the biochemistry in the blood
and<00:01:56.119> in<00:01:57.020> my<00:01:57.440> hand<00:01:57.680> here<00:01:57.979> I've<00:01:58.190> got<00:01:58.220> a<00:01:59.000> blood

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
and in my hand here I've got a blood

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.270 
and in my hand here I've got a blood
agar<00:01:59.810> plate<00:02:00.110> which<00:02:00.710> has<00:02:01.040> been<00:02:01.760> inoculated

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.590 

it's<00:02:09.390> grown<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.690> bacteria<00:02:10.410> on<00:02:11.340> there<00:02:11.640> which<00:02:11.910> i'm

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
it's grown a bacteria on there which i'm

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.020 
it's grown a bacteria on there which i'm
about<00:02:13.020> to<00:02:13.320> identify<00:02:13.890> i<00:02:13.920> do<00:02:14.100> this<00:02:14.370> by<00:02:14.580> doing<00:02:14.640> a

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
about to identify i do this by doing a

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.150 
about to identify i do this by doing a
stain<00:02:15.660> and<00:02:16.050> looking<00:02:16.650> at<00:02:16.800> it<00:02:16.920> under<00:02:17.040> the

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
stain and looking at it under the

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.110 
stain and looking at it under the
microscope<00:02:18.620> there<00:02:19.620> are<00:02:19.740> also<00:02:19.890> other<00:02:20.250> tests

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
microscope there are also other tests

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.910 
microscope there are also other tests
that<00:02:21.150> we<00:02:21.330> can<00:02:21.510> do<00:02:21.660> to<00:02:21.870> determine<00:02:22.380> further<00:02:22.680> what

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
that we can do to determine further what

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.480 
that we can do to determine further what
the<00:02:23.070> bacteria<00:02:23.550> is<00:02:24.020> and<00:02:25.020> then<00:02:25.650> we'll<00:02:25.950> do<00:02:26.160> a

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
the bacteria is and then we'll do a

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.870 
the bacteria is and then we'll do a
sensitivity<00:02:27.350> using<00:02:28.350> antibiotic<00:02:28.920> disks<00:02:29.400> so

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
sensitivity using antibiotic disks so

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.200 
sensitivity using antibiotic disks so
that<00:02:30.060> we<00:02:30.150> know<00:02:30.330> which<00:02:30.630> antibiotic<00:02:31.350> to<00:02:31.890> treat

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
that we know which antibiotic to treat

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.800 
that we know which antibiotic to treat
the<00:02:33.210> animal<00:02:33.510> with<00:02:33.690> for<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.440> best<00:02:34.620> results
