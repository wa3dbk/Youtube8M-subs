00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.469
 hello that as they are I hope very 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.840
 Well, well, this week, doing 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:13.240
 another video tutorial for all of you 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.789
 in this option we are seeing a 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.070
 very important program that is very useful 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:20.140
 for people who really work 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.929
 like computers for a day 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.689
 complete and therefore if you take away some of 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:27.339
 this has happened and when you are a good 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.279
 time on the computer is like your 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:31.689
 Eyes tire you out and there are currently 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.480
 some glasses that obviously 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:36.070
 avoid this and against the rays that we 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.350
 that gives us what the computer is and 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.449
 all that ok but well we are also going to 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.480
 talk about a program that will make us 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:45.160
 useful in front of that problem that happens to us 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.530
 when we are talking for a long time 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.989
 which is the computers, well, let's go 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.969
 to go to download to this page where 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.510
 I have it that by the way is my 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:54.340
 page 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.710
 by the way visit my page so that 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:00.730
 can see many new things here 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.679
 as you will see here I have programs for 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.129
 computers also applications for 

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:06.409
 phones 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.780
 I really recommend it to give a 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.950
 visit here to download program 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.920
 we're going to go to the bottom 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.380
 where it says utilities just now 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.850
 I'm here and well here is this 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.549
 program that we are going to download that 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.039
 call sign up this program is very 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:25.130
 useful currently I'm testing it on 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:28.819
 windows 8 and it works perfectly in 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.649
 windows xp and in windows 7 and I imagine that 

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:33.200
 the other versions must also 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:35.750
 work perfectly we will go 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.560
 down here we just have 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.630
 some images of the program see that 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.209
 here is the normal screen and here it comes out 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.860
 a shorter screen and then for 

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:48.319
 download the program we are going to click on 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.380
 download and well here it will load us 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:53.060
 what is the adp light ad that is coming 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.429
 to be like 5 seconds is not the most 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.740
 expect this and for once 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:59.300
 this will happen we will give in jumping 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.610
 advertising 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.850
 and then we will be downloading the 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:08.020
 program from the program does not happen much 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:11.000
 the program is very easy as you will see it is 4 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.850
 421 kilos vice is very short so that what 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.250
 can download 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.800
 well I'm not going to download because I 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.410
 I have here you would just leave 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.230
 as well as it's good I had it here 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.920
 in the part of recipes charges I already 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.170
 I put in the part on my desk 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.210
 right here is the program that we 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.640
 will you simply download the 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:37.510
 run double click and give READY 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.490
 will install easy and fast ok this 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.300
 when you starting the computer 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:45.010
 it's always going to come out you have to 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.570
 install again or click 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.190
 again double click here gives access 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.100
 direct that's why I put it here 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.400
 to go directly if I do not accept it 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.680
 Well obviously know how it is now 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.230
 let's click again 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.740
 click as you will see here has already been 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.470
 put lighter or darker what is 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.360
 the screen and if we go to this option 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.570
 from here below this is what would come to 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.450
 be sent haiti or configurations 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.650
 Well, here we can configure our 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.799
 fashion key 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.780
 then we can associate a key to 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.939
 lower and raise the brightness of our 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.280
 computer directly without using the 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:27.290
 program or because you do not want to do this 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.989
 I can simply tell you here 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.829
 and right and here you can see what they are 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:36.859
 the qualities the screen capabilities 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:38.180
 well I already configure it for the keys 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:40.819
 that I had mentioned earlier 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.560
 then let's see what happens 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:46.180
 It is the main menu 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.180
 we will see more control q 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.410
 let's start again to double 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.810
 click 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.640
 why 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.800
 and that's what happens when I want 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.989
 lower the brightness the total brightness of my 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.150
 computer, if I want to upload 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.950
 just all the keys that there were 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.650
 selected I upload them in a way 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.930
 fast until I get my total shine 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.849
 nothing guys this for this program has 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.650
 been very good the truth is that it is 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:17.280
 very useful at night most of all when 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:19.230
 I do my jobs and all that gives me 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.910
 ease to be able to do all this 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.980
 when you visit some pages and everything 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.260
