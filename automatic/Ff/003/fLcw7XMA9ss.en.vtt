on a role from a comic book show kind of

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.859 
on a role from a comic book show kind of
yeah<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.490> mean<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:44.970> guess<00:01:45.149> it's<00:01:45.360> always<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.659> little

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
yeah I mean I guess it's always a little

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.530 
yeah I mean I guess it's always a little
bit<00:01:46.020> yeah<00:01:47.009> yeah<00:01:47.520> definitely<00:01:47.759> intimidating

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
bit yeah yeah definitely intimidating

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.840 
bit yeah yeah definitely intimidating
but<00:01:48.720> I've<00:01:49.439> it's<00:01:50.159> such<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.430> collaborative

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
but I've it's such a collaborative

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.789 
but I've it's such a collaborative
effort<00:01:51.390> between<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.750> writers<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.740> the

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
effort between the writers and the

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.770 
effort between the writers and the
producers<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.970> even<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.390> people<00:01:54.750> who

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
producers and even the people who

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.440 
producers and even the people who
created<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.229> comic<00:01:55.680> character<00:01:56.100> so<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.670> think

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
created the comic character so I think

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.940 
created the comic character so I think
we're<00:01:57.659> doing<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.960> good<00:01:58.110> job<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.530> don't<00:01:58.619> feel<00:01:58.829> like
