you just describe it clearly they should

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.359 
you just describe it clearly they should

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
but refuses to do so because they're

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.880

financial<00:05:01.940> interests<00:05:02.270> have<00:05:02.360> so<00:05:02.540> much<00:05:02.690> control

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
financial interests have so much control

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.200 
financial interests have so much control
that<00:05:03.140> our<00:05:03.710> government<00:05:04.190> literally<00:05:04.760> is<00:05:04.850> willing

transfer<00:05:07.250> with<00:05:07.700> no<00:05:07.910> consequences<00:05:08.630> I<00:05:08.980> think

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
transfer with no consequences I think

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.260 
transfer with no consequences I think
that's<00:05:10.130> a<00:05:10.250> fair<00:05:10.460> statement<00:05:10.490> and<00:05:10.970> I<00:05:11.000> would<00:05:11.030> add

the creation of the the idea of too big

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.340
