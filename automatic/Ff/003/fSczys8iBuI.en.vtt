a tecumseh engine it's basically the

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.459 
a tecumseh engine it's basically the
same<00:02:02.310> procedure<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:03.119> remove<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.780> replace<00:02:04.020> the

air<00:02:04.649> filter<00:02:04.680> on<00:02:05.250> this<00:02:05.969> one<00:02:06.180> though<00:02:06.329> you<00:02:06.479> would

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
air filter on this one though you would

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.410 
air filter on this one though you would
turn<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.020> cover<00:02:07.200> clockwise<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.459> then<00:02:09.119> pull

turn the cover clockwise and then pull

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.890 
turn the cover clockwise and then pull
out<00:02:09.629> and<00:02:10.610> the<00:02:11.610> filter<00:02:11.940> would<00:02:12.090> probably<00:02:12.690> come

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
out and the filter would probably come

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.770 
out and the filter would probably come
out<00:02:13.020> with

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
out with

is a different kind of filter it's a bit

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.270 
is a different kind of filter it's a bit
bigger<00:02:19.300> and<00:02:19.569> if<00:02:20.530> your<00:02:20.680> lawnmower<00:02:20.890> has<00:02:21.220> a

bigger and if your lawnmower has a
filter<00:02:21.819> like<00:02:22.030> this<00:02:22.060> then<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:22.630> part<00:02:22.900> number

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
filter like this then the part number

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.790 
filter like this then the part number
will<00:02:23.350> be<00:02:23.560> three<00:02:24.100> six<00:02:24.670> nine<00:02:25.240> zero<00:02:25.569> five<00:02:26.260> from
