00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
athletics I think that intercollegiate

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.030 
athletics I think that intercollegiate
athletics<00:02:17.870> continues<00:02:18.440> to<00:02:18.560> be<00:02:18.680> one<00:02:18.860> of<00:02:18.980> the

best leadership laboratories that are
available<00:02:21.230> on<00:02:21.620> campus<00:02:21.680> I<00:02:22.340> would<00:02:22.790> argue<00:02:23.239> that

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.530

these are legitimate courses as long as

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.360

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
they are worthy of credit then I

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.160 
they are worthy of credit then I
consider<00:02:30.290> that<00:02:30.349> to<00:02:30.500> be<00:02:30.620> a<00:02:30.739> legitimate<00:02:31.099> course
