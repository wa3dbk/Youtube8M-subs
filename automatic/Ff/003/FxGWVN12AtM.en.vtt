a<00:01:50.240> little<00:01:50.750> bit<00:01:50.930> neglected<00:01:51.080> really<00:01:51.800> because<00:01:52.550> I

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
a little bit neglected really because I

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.670 
a little bit neglected really because I
haven't<00:01:53.000> had<00:01:53.330> time<00:01:53.630> especially<00:01:54.290> I<00:01:54.440> mean<00:01:54.620> you

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
haven't had time especially I mean you

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.050 
haven't had time especially I mean you
can<00:01:54.830> see<00:01:54.950> the<00:01:55.070> corner<00:01:55.370> they're<00:01:55.520> full<00:01:55.730> of<00:01:55.820> weeds

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
can see the corner they're full of weeds

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.630 
can see the corner they're full of weeds
so<00:01:56.960> we<00:01:57.290> just<00:01:57.620> get<00:01:57.740> it<00:01:57.830> all<00:01:57.950> cleaned<00:01:58.220> up<00:01:58.400> and

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
so we just get it all cleaned up and

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.370 
so we just get it all cleaned up and
plant<00:01:59.000> it<00:01:59.180> up<00:01:59.300> so<00:01:59.450> a<00:01:59.540> good<00:01:59.720> thing<00:01:59.870> to<00:01:59.990> show<00:02:00.020> is

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
up there and I've marked the rows here

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.979 
up there and I've marked the rows here
now<00:02:06.590> you<00:02:06.650> want<00:02:07.010> to<00:02:07.070> make<00:02:07.190> sure<00:02:07.220> that<00:02:07.629> you<00:02:08.629> you

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
now you want to make sure that you you

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.160 
now you want to make sure that you you
know<00:02:09.139> you<00:02:09.439> basically<00:02:10.719> thin<00:02:11.719> them<00:02:11.870> out<00:02:11.989> a<00:02:12.019> bit

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
know you basically thin them out a bit

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.320 
know you basically thin them out a bit
you<00:02:12.560> can<00:02:13.280> do<00:02:13.459> that<00:02:13.609> with<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.819> Pierces

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
you can do that with the Pierces

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.230 
you can do that with the Pierces
just<00:02:14.720> you<00:02:14.960> know<00:02:15.050> cut<00:02:15.290> them<00:02:15.500> I<00:02:15.740> just<00:02:16.670> leave<00:02:17.060> one

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
just you know cut them I just leave one

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.100 
just you know cut them I just leave one
or<00:02:17.300> two<00:02:17.890> you<00:02:18.890> know<00:02:18.920> every<00:02:19.340> so<00:02:19.720> maybe<00:02:20.720> I<00:02:20.840> don't

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
or two you know every so maybe I don't

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.020 
or two you know every so maybe I don't
maybe<00:02:21.470> every<00:02:21.740> six<00:02:21.920> or<00:02:22.130> seven<00:02:22.400> centimeters<00:02:22.910> I

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
maybe every six or seven centimeters I

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.270 
maybe every six or seven centimeters I
got<00:02:23.270> some<00:02:23.510> weeding<00:02:23.840> away<00:02:24.050> and<00:02:24.560> I<00:02:24.710> found<00:02:25.010> a<00:02:25.130> big

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
got some weeding away and I found a big

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:36.460 
got some weeding away and I found a big
stash<00:02:25.870> of<00:02:26.870> slug<00:02:27.260> eggs<00:02:35.170> that's<00:02:36.170> what<00:02:36.320> that

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
stash of slug eggs that's what that

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.220 
stash of slug eggs that's what that
looks<00:02:36.620> like<00:02:36.770> now<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:38.360> slug<00:02:38.720> will<00:02:38.930> come<00:02:39.110> back

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
looks like now the slug will come back

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.090 
looks like now the slug will come back
here<00:02:39.970> and<00:02:40.970> she<00:02:41.930> will<00:02:42.050> basically<00:02:42.470> put<00:02:42.680> a

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
here and she will basically put a

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.450 
here and she will basically put a
certain<00:02:43.940> chemical<00:02:44.360> homage<00:02:44.830> and<00:02:45.830> to<00:02:46.040> stop<00:02:46.280> them

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 
certain chemical homage and to stop them

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.320 
certain chemical homage and to stop them
from<00:02:46.580> hatching<00:02:46.900> if<00:02:47.900> I<00:02:48.050> took<00:02:48.110> away<00:02:48.350> the<00:02:48.620> slug

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
from hatching if I took away the slug

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.720 
from hatching if I took away the slug
basically<00:02:50.330> what<00:02:50.450> would<00:02:50.570> happen<00:02:50.900> is<00:02:51.730> she

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
basically what would happen is she

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:53.920 
basically what would happen is she
wouldn't<00:02:52.970> come<00:02:53.120> back<00:02:53.270> and<00:02:53.330> they<00:02:53.630> would<00:02:53.780> all

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
wouldn't come back and they would all

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.870 
wouldn't come back and they would all
hatch<00:02:54.170> and<00:02:55.010> all<00:02:55.130> of<00:02:55.220> a<00:02:55.280> sudden<00:02:55.550> you<00:02:55.610> would<00:02:55.700> have

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
hatch and all of a sudden you would have

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.520 
hatch and all of a sudden you would have
loads<00:02:56.209> of<00:02:56.420> loads<00:02:56.660> of<00:02:56.840> little<00:02:57.020> baby<00:02:57.170> slugs

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
I can't maybe take away all the slug

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.180 
I can't maybe take away all the slug
eggs<00:03:10.250> as<00:03:10.459> well<00:03:11.380> now<00:03:12.380> as<00:03:12.500> you<00:03:12.620> can<00:03:12.709> see<00:03:12.770> I<00:03:12.920> have

it's no problem actually so directly
into<00:04:37.290> the<00:04:37.380> bed<00:04:37.530> at<00:04:37.680> this<00:04:37.770> time<00:04:37.830> of<00:04:38.130> the<00:04:38.190> even

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
into the bed at this time of the even

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:39.670 
into the bed at this time of the even
you<00:04:38.850> know<00:04:39.000> in<00:04:39.120> a<00:04:39.210> tunnel<00:04:39.510> because

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
you know in a tunnel because

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.930 
you know in a tunnel because
everything's<00:04:40.680> sheltered<00:04:41.100> from<00:04:41.160> the<00:04:41.250> wind<00:04:41.490> and

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
everything's sheltered from the wind and

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.730 
everything's sheltered from the wind and
you<00:04:42.150> know<00:04:42.270> the<00:04:42.450> temperatures<00:04:42.960> are<00:04:43.200> right<00:04:43.380> and

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
you know the temperatures are right and

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.500 
you know the temperatures are right and
so<00:04:44.100> it<00:04:44.250> should<00:04:44.400> be<00:04:44.550> it<00:04:44.850> should<00:04:44.880> be<00:04:45.090> fine<00:04:45.300> just

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
so it should be it should be fine just

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.360 
so it should be it should be fine just
keep<00:04:45.840> it<00:04:46.110> make<00:04:46.290> sure<00:04:46.320> that<00:04:46.470> you<00:04:46.680> can<00:04:46.920> water<00:04:47.220> it

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370

every<00:04:47.730> three<00:04:47.940> days<00:04:48.120> or<00:04:48.360> so<00:04:48.540> because<00:04:48.930> otherwise

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
every three days or so because otherwise

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.900 
every three days or so because otherwise
they<00:04:49.440> dry<00:04:49.620> out<00:04:49.650> so<00:04:49.980> my<00:04:50.160> lettuce<00:04:50.460> seeds<00:04:50.670> here
