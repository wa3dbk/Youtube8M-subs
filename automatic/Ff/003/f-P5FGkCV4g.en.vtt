00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:28.679
 it was a lot slower you just could not do that 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.650
 Reason not to drive too fast can also be in the cost 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.370
 and you can not do that too 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.280
 Megan will take us otherwise one will have some standard way of thinking 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.530
 where does it lead? 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.830
 and every time in the north, if you have to deviate from it, that's the first time you 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.060
 if you have to completely reorient yourself I was so 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.920
 no long 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.410

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.120
 Percent were 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.740
 were important 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.660
 with much less 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.910
 should be prohibited again and again during the week 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.930
 one has more to do under water, the topic Dr 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.320
 September were

 should have the left 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.250
 - 8000 spectators 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.250
 it is not a trace 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.870
 that's the other Meissner 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.470
 after 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.770
 otherwise quite shadowy few streets Berger from 30 a 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.510
 unexpectedly 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.510
 Banks are not forgotten by these countries 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.740
 "Of course I'm just looking forward to myself

 despite continuing air attacks 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.810
 the survival issue 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.800
 probably the partners have their 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.600

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.600
 According to the weather forecasts, there is no improvement 

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:09.090
