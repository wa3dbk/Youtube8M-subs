00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.630
 m 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.440
 louis 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.270
 to see, I think it's a game in the 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.550
 that even Tabares recognized it in the 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.050
 own press conference the possession 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.730
 of the ball is going to be more time from peru 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.730
 not what without what not necessarily 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.820
 means that the control of the party is 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.570
 from Peru I think it's a party in the 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.650
 what but you have to have let's say many 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.920
 offensive variants do not be 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.610
 few static positions much 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.700
 mobility 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.070
 it's difficult sometimes in football to have 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.570
 speed and precision but it's a match 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.400
 where your speed needs to be 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.170
 precision 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.380
 and handle very well the different 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:10.780
 game speeds and in that sense 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:13.270
 I think I trust the players and in 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.890
 the technical resources they have for what 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.620
 that we were commenting on or in 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:21.370
 ramirez in crusader in farfán 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.990
 I do not imagine a farfán so recostado 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.130
 about the band as in previous 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.810
 matches 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.990
 I imagine that it is going to be a farfán that goes 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.970
 to close more to look is to play below 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.640
 and for the center with with pizarro with 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.400
 warrior and apart from all this that is 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:41.140
 basically what you have to do with the 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.700
 possession of the ball is the match by 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.670
 the power that the opponent has in attack 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.160
 it's the game where you have to know 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.800
 defend while attacking I think that that's 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.600
 key for Peru tomorrow while 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.390
 we attack we have to know how to defend 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.850
 we have to be well behind 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.560
 because being badly stopped in defense we 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.930
 they steal a ball 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.850
 and Uruguay has forwards that what of the 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.560
 nothing you do a goal to the three of 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.130
 above uruguay we are very good 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.899
 front 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.940
 I prefer a team that has less 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:13.540
 time to the ball but when the 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.730
 I know what to do with it and I think that 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.940
 that's fundamental to beating 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.459
 Uruguay is , is a is a party in the 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:25.330
 you have to know very well what to do 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.980
 with the ball open the court I'm 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.470
 I agree with you the departure of the 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:33.580
 lateral I think that 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.620
 is timely and has been a very player 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.250
 regular remember the goal against chile is 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:43.710
 a play that is born precisely from a 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.710
 youtube action I think that 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.440
 ramirez crossed 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.880
 farfán pizarro warriors are players 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.650
 who are able to 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.740
 in Lima have shown that they are in 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.560
 conditions to complicate any 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:03.780
 pantry now I uruguay your team that 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:06.690
 he defends well but I think he has a 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.760
 better defensive functioning of the 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:14.069
 left side of his defense to me 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:16.220
 it seems that the side of Godín and Cáceres 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:20.040
 is much more solid than the side of 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.360
 lugano and maxi pereira when when 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.270
 we all talk about the defenders 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.610
 Uruguayan even in the world many 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.910
 Peruvians we identify with Uruguay 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.580
 place was not a leader a reference if you 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.959
 you ask me is a captain the other day 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.520
 I was speaking with a Uruguayan journalist 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.190
 missile to me I do not care if it plays well or 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.959
 bad not he is the capital of the team but 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.610
 for me the best defender that has 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.450
 Uruguay is almost the average to me 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.900
 it seems that 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:49.299
 the link is Peruvian 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.370
 is identifying with the selection 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:52.930
 regardless of the passage of time and that 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.980
 every time 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.420
 the pressure is greater for so many years without 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.689
 classify and it always ends up happening that 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.049
 the current selection drags with years in 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:05.920
 those that they do not have absolutely 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:08.319
 responsibility this team drags the 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.900
 30 years does not drag at 4 years until 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:12.459
 30 because it's something they have to accept 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.709
 and it's something that they have to know 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:19.680
 live, I feel that the Peruvian fans 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:19.680
 has changed a bit in what it means 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.830
 and go to see a team game not 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.810
 it's another audience but it's a public that 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:31.540
 encourages that identifies is no longer a 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.990
 theater go see a match of the 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.060
 selection 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:38.290
 the new national I think he collaborates 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.290
 has another acoustics 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:45.900
 but but I do not remember the 2000 was the 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.330
 2000 a Peruvian-Brazilian party for 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.430
 Japan-Korea qualifiers with prices in 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.010
 that then very high in relation to 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:56.070
 what was charged with the championship and 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:58.410
 stadium was a silence not full but in 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:01.560
 yes them now not now is another public 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:04.520
 but but I feel there is another energy in 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.520
 the environment 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.340
 to be able to encourage the selection 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:14.730
 i 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:17.980
 I did not like it, I do not think we 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.750
 sum does not add us in the sports not 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:21.139
 add up 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:25.400
 absolutely nothing 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:28.050
 I mean, I think yes, if you want 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.900
 wear yourself on something or use your 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.580
 energy in something used by encouraging your 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.280
 selection that on the side of what 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.849
 sporty but then in the other we 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:41.869
 leave a terrible image 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:44.899
 a country that works for a brand a 

00:05:41.869 --> 00:05:46.699
 city ​​that is applying to be made 

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:49.610
 some Pan-American games to receive 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:52.789
 thousands of athletes from other countries 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.709
 It seems that there is no way for more than 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:57.830
 been eggs and not and not stones like 

00:05:54.709 --> 00:06:01.909
 it happened against equal Argentines that's 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:03.889
 a gesture that is unacceptable and that is not 

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:06.379
 It has nothing to do with these times no 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:07.849
 we are talking about the times in which to go 

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:10.159
 to play a game as a visitor 

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:12.709
 means all this and it has never been 

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:15.580
 good for football and it's not only 

00:06:12.709 --> 00:06:17.809
 a sporting theme I think that that 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.719
 transmits a very bad image towards 

00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:24.199
 outside like as people as citizens 

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:25.369
 as countries it is pathetic they received a 

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:27.409
 team that comes to play a game of 

00:06:25.369 --> 00:06:29.719
 football that way the expectation that 

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:32.810
 has been generated about this game is a 

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:36.310
 big expectation is a 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:39.139
 in expectations and football is a 

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:40.490
 excuse sometimes to be happy to 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:44.000
 find the happiness you can not find 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:45.560
 in other things then hopefully the 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.139
 players realize what 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.520
 means for the people a party of 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:53.030
 but football is not at stake 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:55.250
 homeland or anything like that but it is very 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:59.180
 valuable for the citizen for the mood 

00:06:55.250 --> 00:07:01.820
 of the people and there they are then here no longer 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:04.190
 We are talking about the remaining 23 years 

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:06.650
 of commitment responsibility are to 

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.570
 four games of entry into the 

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:11.930
 big story of the Peruvian sport 

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:14.419
 because to qualify for a world cup is what 

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:17.169
 maximum for an athlete break in this 

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:17.169
 case for a soccer player 

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.580
 i
