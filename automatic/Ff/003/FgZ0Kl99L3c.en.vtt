00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
off to the side so there's a fate light

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.340 
off to the side so there's a fate light
on<00:00:44.640> them<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.210> then<00:00:45.719> you're<00:00:45.870> going<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.050> want<00:00:46.260> to

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
on them and then you're going to want to

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.170 
on them and then you're going to want to
go<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.649> grab<00:00:46.860> them<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.219> if<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.760> could<00:00:47.940> see

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
go and grab them and if you could see

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.630 
go and grab them and if you could see
where<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:49.260> hole<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:50.070> want<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.280> grab<00:00:50.399> them

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
where the hole is you want to grab them

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.400 
where the hole is you want to grab them
right<00:00:50.789> at<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.000> hole<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.989> other<00:00:52.140> thing

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
right at the hole and the other thing

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.319 
right at the hole and the other thing
when<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.649> comes<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:52.980> catching<00:00:53.340> worms<00:00:53.489> there's

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
when it comes to catching worms there's

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.670 
when it comes to catching worms there's
an<00:00:54.510> easier<00:00:54.840> way<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:54.989> pull<00:00:55.289> them<00:00:55.410> out<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.559> the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
an easier way to pull them out of the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.500 
an easier way to pull them out of the
hole<00:00:55.890> if<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.340> try<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.699> pull<00:00:56.940> them<00:00:57.059> straight<00:00:57.239> up

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
hole if you try to pull them straight up

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.099 
hole if you try to pull them straight up
and<00:00:57.870> out<00:00:58.730> they<00:00:59.730> end<00:01:00.030> up<00:01:00.210> gripping<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.899> hole

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
and out they end up gripping the hole

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.599 
and out they end up gripping the hole
and<00:01:01.379> they're<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.500> little<00:01:01.680> bit<00:01:01.890> harder<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.340> you

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
and they're a little bit harder and you

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.729 
and they're a little bit harder and you
might<00:01:02.760> actually<00:01:02.940> break<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.480> worm<00:01:03.660> if<00:01:03.899> you

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
might actually break the worm if you

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.210 
might actually break the worm if you
pull<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.430> worm<00:01:06.260> across<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.590> ground<00:01:07.890> so

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
pull the worm across the ground so

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.530 
pull the worm across the ground so
instead<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.610> pulling<00:01:08.760> them<00:01:08.939> vertically<00:01:09.420> you

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
instead of pulling them vertically you

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.690 
instead of pulling them vertically you
pull<00:01:09.780> them<00:01:09.930> horizontally<00:01:10.340> he'll<00:01:11.340> come<00:01:11.520> out<00:01:11.549> a

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
pull them horizontally he'll come out a

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.460 
pull them horizontally he'll come out a
lot<00:01:11.880> easier<00:01:11.909> so<00:01:12.689> let's<00:01:12.869> go<00:01:13.020> see<00:01:13.229> if<00:01:13.320> we<00:01:13.380> can

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
lot easier so let's go see if we can

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.710 
lot easier so let's go see if we can
catch<00:01:13.770> ourself<00:01:14.189> at<00:01:14.610> least<00:01:14.850> one<00:01:15.060> worm<00:01:15.270> okay

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
catch ourself at least one worm okay

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.120 
catch ourself at least one worm okay
folks<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.170> other<00:01:16.290> thing<00:01:16.560> when<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.799> comes<00:01:16.979> to

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
folks the other thing when it comes to

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.560 
folks the other thing when it comes to
worms<00:01:17.340> they<00:01:17.670> were<00:01:17.729> also<00:01:18.060> sensitive<00:01:18.450> to

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
worms they were also sensitive to

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.230 
worms they were also sensitive to
vibration<00:01:19.229> so<00:01:19.470> if<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.799> move<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.520> area<00:01:20.880> around

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
vibration so if you move the area around

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.570 
vibration so if you move the area around
the<00:01:21.540> worm<00:01:21.720> he'll<00:01:22.290> sense<00:01:22.619> danger<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.460> he'll

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
the worm he'll sense danger and he'll

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.370 
the worm he'll sense danger and he'll
take<00:01:23.790> off<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.240> in<00:01:24.659> fact<00:01:24.840> they<00:01:24.990> just<00:01:25.020> saw<00:01:25.350> a

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
take off and in fact they just saw a

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.530 
take off and in fact they just saw a
