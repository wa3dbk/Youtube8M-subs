00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.029
 [Music] 

00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.890
 Hello, well, in this video I'm going to 

00:00:03.029 --> 00:00:08.069
 teach how to draw this pretty 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.530
 frankenstein is worth in a past video already 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.240
 teach them how to make this witch who 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.329
 well this was my first drawing but 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.130
 when I did the tutorial this was how it was 

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:19.380
 my result is worth the only thing that changed 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.510
 It was good as you can notice the 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.430
 this side has the smallest eyes 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.320
 Okay, and the one on this side, they have the 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.110
 bigger eyes and this one has like that 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.640
 the most fluffy change and this one has it 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.579
 longer that's why it looks more 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.400
 thin and good now I'm going to teach you 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.970
 to draw this frankenstein what we're going 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:42.150
 to need exactly is a stroke or a 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.440
 compass or something that is well round for 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.680
 mark the outline 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.289
 a sheet a pencil and a nice one in case 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.530
 we were wrong and good first thing 

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:56.079
 let's do is mark the circle 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.110
 complete, but it's like, 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:01.629
 softly we are going to mark it soft 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.930
 because if we have to delete it, let's erase 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.430
 Okay, there's more or less my little circle 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:11.320
 I already checked it 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:13.690
 and well now let's cut here 122 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.260
 lines so vertical one on this side and 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:20.770
 one of this goes like this and we're going to erase 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:24.050
 Hence this piece is like 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.450
 so little redondito spare us 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.480
 and this one also because frankenstein and so 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.840
 like that more square is not there is that its 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:35.720
 we can highlight it so that it 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.780
 note a little more 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.250
 very careful that we do not go 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.750
 to make a mistake 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.750
 or to go very young 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.940
 good is not perfect either 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:53.750
 but now we do have this little figurine 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:58.130
 it is very easy for example, more or less 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:00.439
 about here from here 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.430
 I'm going to start marking it like that 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:09.380
 a curvita a curvita without sur chung 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:13.310
 yong chun is alive and well now 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:18.650
 I'm going to do what I'm going to mark here 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:21.140
 two lines and two lines here 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.450
 well you saw two kings here and two 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.959
 hatch here and I'll close them like that with 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.959
 a little circle 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:35.180
 these are your screws 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:37.370
 well you saw they suddenly reminded me to be 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.530
 but good not ours that do not go away 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.990
 to confuse now what we are going to do 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.080
 are your eyes that are so two 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:49.050
 little circles here 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.050
 and inside we are going to draw another 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.120
 and inside the moon is skinny 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.790
 skinny that we have left we are going to 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:03.060
 draw another two little circles 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.969
 that's how they looked inside two other 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.700
 small circles we are going to draw all of the 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:11.040
 lunita that is not the circulitos or 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.739
 everything that was left on the moon that is 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.000
 out of the circles so that we stay 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:19.079
 as well as that a more luminous effect like that 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.450
 well now what we are going to do is 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:25.079
 to put an edge on them I always 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.760
 I put it like this with a curvy like that 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:29.569
 more up 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.569
 and his little mouth 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:38.760
 You've seen now what we're going to do is 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:42.540
 put your tape here your Band-Aid come on 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.080
 to plot well as well as make account of 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.470
 this figure 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.459
 Well here I 'm going to make a little boy 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.700
 so do accounts that we're going to 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.730
 draw two lines so we are going to close them 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.550
 with a curvita here 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:59.989
 so one curvita on each side is worth 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:02.569
 as it is not a crushed oval 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:05.720
 as a rectangle but with late 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:08.330
 curve then we are going to draw it thus the 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:12.799
 two little lines that I told them and we 're going to 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:15.980
 end here with a small curve like this and 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:18.290
 now crossed on the other side but so 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.570
 nothing else as you see below the other 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.030
 cintilla then nothing else we mark him 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:27.320
 two stripes on one side and two stripes on the 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:30.680
 another one is worth it and we finish it with another curve 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:33.800
 is or I do not know how to say it we end like this 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.100
 and there has to be a roof like that and here 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:40.310
 in the center, well, we can do this 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:42.950
 join so little and put a few dots to 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:46.490
 The edges 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:49.190
 something like that and well we have ready 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:51.560
 our frankenstein I hope you have them 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.630
 liked do not forget to comment qualify and 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.960
 subscribe here tell me if they were made 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:05:01.600
 difficult if they liked it or what a wave is worth 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.600
 then we see in the next video
