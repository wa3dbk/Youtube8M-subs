00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
right a lot of blood being used by the

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.120 
right a lot of blood being used by the
shark<00:00:03.030> this<00:00:03.570> pink<00:00:04.049> stuff<00:00:04.140> will<00:00:04.440> end<00:00:04.650> up<00:00:04.830> there

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
shark this pink stuff will end up there

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.690 
shark this pink stuff will end up there
and<00:00:05.549> it's<00:00:06.350> it's<00:00:07.350> a<00:00:07.560> it<00:00:07.830> gets<00:00:07.980> into<00:00:08.370> every

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
and it's it's a it gets into every

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.580 
and it's it's a it gets into every
single<00:00:08.940> blood<00:00:09.420> vessel<00:00:09.780> that<00:00:09.809> they<00:00:09.929> have<00:00:10.200> so<00:00:10.469> it

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
single blood vessel that they have so it

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.490 
single blood vessel that they have so it
really<00:00:10.830> gets<00:00:11.429> around<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:12.570> tail<00:00:12.870> has<00:00:13.049> been<00:00:13.230> cut

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
really gets around the tail has been cut

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.620 
really gets around the tail has been cut
off<00:00:13.710> almost<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:15.000> reason<00:00:15.269> for<00:00:15.389> that<00:00:15.450> I

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
off almost and the reason for that I

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.390 
off almost and the reason for that I
probably<00:00:15.900> said<00:00:16.139> in<00:00:16.289> humorous<00:00:16.590> times<00:00:16.830> is<00:00:17.160> so

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
probably said in humorous times is so

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.310 
probably said in humorous times is so
that<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.670> preservative<00:00:18.270> can<00:00:18.480> get<00:00:18.630> into<00:00:18.990> it

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
that the preservative can get into it

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.570 
that the preservative can get into it
these<00:00:19.740> things<00:00:19.949> are<00:00:20.070> soaked<00:00:20.340> in<00:00:20.460> a

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
these things are soaked in a

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.910 
these things are soaked in a
preservative<00:00:21.090> it'll<00:00:22.080> obviously<00:00:22.230> go<00:00:22.680> in<00:00:22.830> the

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
preservative it'll obviously go in the

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.890 
preservative it'll obviously go in the
mouth<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.310> then<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.550> gills<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.090> things<00:00:24.300> but

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
mouth and then the gills and things but

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.320 
mouth and then the gills and things but
you<00:00:25.080> need<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.410> get<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.710> this<00:00:25.939> basically<00:00:26.939> from

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
you need to get it this basically from

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.320 
you need to get it this basically from
all<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.779> this<00:00:27.900> area<00:00:28.199> here<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:28.560> just<00:00:28.800> muscle<00:00:29.340> so

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
all of this area here is just muscle so

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.910 
all of this area here is just muscle so
that's<00:00:30.689> where<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:30.990> preservative<00:00:31.500> needs<00:00:31.710> to

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
that's where the preservative needs to

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.970 
that's where the preservative needs to
go<00:00:32.099> it's<00:00:33.000> called<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.450> spiny<00:00:33.809> dogfish<00:00:34.410> because

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
go it's called a spiny dogfish because

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.540 
go it's called a spiny dogfish because
it<00:00:35.309> would<00:00:35.820> have<00:00:36.500> two<00:00:37.500> little<00:00:37.710> spines<00:00:38.219> on<00:00:38.520> its

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
it would have two little spines on its

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.760 
it would have two little spines on its
dorsal<00:00:39.030> fins<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.750> they're<00:00:40.350> about<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.559> half

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
dorsal fins and they're about a half

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.150 
dorsal fins and they're about a half
inch<00:00:41.010> long<00:00:41.540> but<00:00:42.540> if<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:42.840> put<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.410> sponge<00:00:43.800> much

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
inch long but if you put a sponge much

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.389 
inch long but if you put a sponge much
to<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:45.350> if<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.590> hold<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.890> up<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.219> could<00:00:47.340> see

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
to it if I hold it up you could see

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.260 
to it if I hold it up you could see
muscle<00:00:47.969> tissues<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.539> yellow<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:48.989> then<00:00:50.270> in

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
muscle tissues the yellow and then in

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.720 
muscle tissues the yellow and then in
the<00:00:51.570> middle<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:52.050> on<00:00:52.320> top<00:00:52.770> there's<00:00:53.219> there's

small male and the reason I could tell

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.260 
small male and the reason I could tell
that<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.840> on<00:01:07.110> these<00:01:07.320> back<00:01:07.590> fins<00:01:08.270> appropriately

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
that is on these back fins appropriately

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.510 
that is on these back fins appropriately
called<00:01:09.479> anal<00:01:09.990> fins<00:01:11.150> there's<00:01:12.150> this<00:01:12.479> additional

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
called anal fins there's this additional

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.370 
called anal fins there's this additional
structure<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.509> got<00:01:15.689> my<00:01:15.780> finger<00:01:16.020> caught<00:01:16.200> on

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
structure that I got my finger caught on

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.160 
structure that I got my finger caught on
and<00:01:16.799> these<00:01:16.920> are<00:01:17.130> called<00:01:17.310> claspers<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.479> only

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
and these are called claspers and only

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.770 
and these are called claspers and only
the<00:01:19.290> male's<00:01:19.500> have<00:01:19.830> those<00:01:20.070> my<00:01:20.310> male<00:01:20.640> snake<00:01:21.210> also

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
the male's have those my male snake also

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.940 
the male's have those my male snake also
has<00:01:21.990> claspers<00:01:23.750> so<00:01:24.750> in<00:01:24.960> there<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.409> believe

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
has claspers so in there I believe

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.240 
has claspers so in there I believe
related<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:26.939> similar<00:01:27.330> function<00:01:27.570> I<00:01:28.250> wish

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
related to a similar function I wish

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.929 
related to a similar function I wish
these<00:01:29.430> fins<00:01:30.020> were<00:01:31.159> kind<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.220> in<00:01:32.369> their<00:01:32.520> normal

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
these fins were kind of in their normal

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.060 
these fins were kind of in their normal
position<00:01:33.750> this<00:01:34.229> was<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.650> one<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:34.950> told

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
position this was the one that I told

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.190 
position this was the one that I told
you<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.579> fixed<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.150> body<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.720> doesn't<00:01:36.930> like

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
you is fixed to the body it doesn't like

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.520 
you is fixed to the body it doesn't like
turn<00:01:37.470> up<00:01:37.500> or<00:01:37.860> down<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.369> as<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.200> shark<00:01:40.200> swims

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
turn up or down and as the shark swims

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.010 
turn up or down and as the shark swims
fo<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.130> gets<00:01:41.310> lift<00:01:41.670> from<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.659> they're

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
fo and it gets lift from it so they're

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.899 
fo and it gets lift from it so they're
out<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.259> little<00:01:43.590> bit<00:01:43.799> of<00:01:43.890> an<00:01:44.009> angle<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.670> little

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
out a little bit of an angle a little

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.120 
out a little bit of an angle a little
bit<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.090> an<00:01:45.180> incline<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:46.320> that's<00:01:46.710> pretty<00:01:47.009> much

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
bit of an incline and that's pretty much

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.960 
bit of an incline and that's pretty much
the<00:01:47.340> whole<00:01:47.369> external<00:01:48.180> trip<00:01:48.420> mouth

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
the whole external trip mouth

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.139 
the whole external trip mouth
the<00:01:50.970> shark<00:01:51.979> all<00:01:52.979> of<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.399> Sharks<00:01:53.759> have<00:01:53.970> this

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
the shark all of the Sharks have this

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.440 
the shark all of the Sharks have this
damaged<00:01:54.689> area<00:01:55.649> here<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:57.000> think<00:01:57.270> that's

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
damaged area here and I think that's

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.980 
damaged area here and I think that's
probably<00:01:57.899> related<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.710> how<00:01:58.950> they<00:01:59.100> hooked<00:01:59.369> them

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
probably related to how they hooked them

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.300 
probably related to how they hooked them
although<00:02:00.990> they're<00:02:01.170> raised<00:02:01.409> on<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.680> farm<00:02:01.799> I

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
although they're raised on a farm I

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.889 
although they're raised on a farm I
think<00:02:02.610> they<00:02:02.700> probably<00:02:02.880> throw<00:02:03.240> bait<00:02:03.479> in<00:02:03.689> on<00:02:03.869> a

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
think they probably throw bait in on a

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.780 
think they probably throw bait in on a
hook<00:02:04.140> hook<00:02:04.680> them<00:02:04.829> up<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.130> they<00:02:05.219> just<00:02:05.250> rip<00:02:05.640> the

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
hook hook them up and they just rip the

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.730 
hook hook them up and they just rip the
hook<00:02:05.939> out<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.390> throw<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.049> fish<00:02:07.229> into<00:02:07.530> the

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
hook out and throw the fish into the

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.999 
hook out and throw the fish into the
boat<00:02:07.920> let<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.489> die<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.690> terrible<00:02:09.989> life<00:02:10.140> we

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
boat let it die and the terrible life we

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.619 
boat let it die and the terrible life we
will<00:02:11.190> be<00:02:11.340> taking<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.790> eye<00:02:11.819> out

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:13.629 
will be taking the eye out

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:18.820 
will be taking the eye out
the<00:02:14.629> shark<00:02:15.500> does<00:02:17.349> you<00:02:18.349> can<00:02:18.470> see<00:02:18.500> all<00:02:18.709> these

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
the shark does you can see all these

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.460 
the shark does you can see all these
little<00:02:18.980> holes<00:02:19.250> in<00:02:19.459> the<00:02:19.550> nostrils<00:02:20.180> have<00:02:21.140> I<00:02:21.230> felt

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
little holes in the nostrils have I felt

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.050 
little holes in the nostrils have I felt
like<00:02:23.349> I'm<00:02:24.349> gonna<00:02:24.530> take<00:02:24.769> the<00:02:24.890> icon<00:02:25.220> the

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
like I'm gonna take the icon the

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.820 
like I'm gonna take the icon the
underneath<00:02:26.480> side<00:02:26.780> of<00:02:27.019> this<00:02:27.110> chart<00:02:27.470> is<00:02:27.800> very

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
underneath side of this chart is very

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.190 
underneath side of this chart is very
thin<00:02:28.459> so<00:02:28.730> I<00:02:29.420> can<00:02:29.630> cut<00:02:29.810> through<00:02:29.930> it<00:02:30.050> really

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
thin so I can cut through it really

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.640 
thin so I can cut through it really
easily<00:02:30.910> these<00:02:31.910> are<00:02:32.180> referred<00:02:32.599> to<00:02:32.660> as<00:02:33.140> culinary

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
easily these are referred to as culinary

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.850 
easily these are referred to as culinary
scissors<00:02:34.900> because<00:02:35.900> they're<00:02:36.290> designed<00:02:36.680> to<00:02:36.800> be

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
scissors because they're designed to be

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.250 
scissors because they're designed to be
used<00:02:37.160> to<00:02:37.310> cut<00:02:37.489> up<00:02:37.519> poultry<00:02:38.269> things<00:02:39.080> like

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
used to cut up poultry things like

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.780 
used to cut up poultry things like
that's<00:02:39.410> what<00:02:39.650> they<00:02:39.739> have<00:02:39.860> to<00:02:39.890> know<00:02:40.099> no<00:02:40.700> problem

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
that's what they have to know no problem

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.309 
that's what they have to know no problem
it's<00:02:43.790> okay<00:02:44.060> so<00:02:44.540> then<00:02:44.750> I<00:02:44.780> just<00:02:45.019> turned<00:02:45.200> the

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
it's okay so then I just turned the

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.220 
it's okay so then I just turned the
shark<00:02:45.590> around<00:02:45.830> basically<00:02:46.340> I<00:02:46.370> cut<00:02:46.700> up<00:02:46.959> and<00:02:47.959> then

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
shark around basically I cut up and then

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.650 
shark around basically I cut up and then
I'm<00:02:48.470> going<00:02:48.950> to<00:02:49.160> turn<00:02:49.910> it<00:02:50.090> around<00:02:50.180> and<00:02:50.480> cut

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
I'm going to turn it around and cut

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:58.180 
I'm going to turn it around and cut
backwards<00:02:51.549> towards<00:02:52.549> the<00:02:52.730> es<00:02:53.180> I<00:02:56.799> stopped<00:02:57.799> when

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
backwards towards the es I stopped when

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.949 
backwards towards the es I stopped when
I<00:02:58.220> got<00:02:58.549> up<00:02:58.730> to<00:02:58.760> where<00:02:59.000> I<00:02:59.060> felt<00:02:59.420> the<00:02:59.569> heart<00:02:59.810> was

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
I got up to where I felt the heart was

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.690 
I got up to where I felt the heart was
beginning<00:03:00.440> you<00:03:00.620> can<00:03:00.769> actually<00:03:00.950> you<00:03:01.220> bump<00:03:01.459> into

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
beginning you can actually you bump into

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.580 
beginning you can actually you bump into
kind<00:03:02.120> of<00:03:02.180> a<00:03:02.269> wall<00:03:02.569> between<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:03.079> heart<00:03:03.290> and<00:03:03.349> the

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
kind of a wall between the heart and the

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:11.410 
kind of a wall between the heart and the
guts<00:03:03.950> and<00:03:04.579> then<00:03:09.430> yeah<00:03:10.430> in<00:03:10.670> previous<00:03:11.060> years

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
guts and then yeah in previous years

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.300 
guts and then yeah in previous years
they<00:03:11.690> used<00:03:11.870> to<00:03:11.989> be<00:03:12.110> just<00:03:12.319> dripping<00:03:12.650> in<00:03:12.950> all<00:03:13.160> of

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
quiet the liver is not a muscle it never

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.800 
quiet the liver is not a muscle it never
moves<00:03:50.079> and<00:03:51.069> it's<00:03:51.430> not<00:03:51.670> hollow<00:03:52.000> it's<00:03:52.599> a

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
moves and it's not hollow it's a

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.720 
moves and it's not hollow it's a
chemical<00:03:53.230> producer<00:03:53.950> and<00:03:54.099> consumer<00:03:54.250> it

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
chemical producer and consumer it

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.309 
chemical producer and consumer it
recycles<00:03:55.150> chemicals<00:03:55.810> and<00:03:55.959> produces

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
recycles chemicals and produces

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:00.629 
recycles chemicals and produces
chemicals<00:03:56.530> so<00:03:57.400> it<00:03:57.790> is<00:03:58.379> solid<00:03:59.379> but<00:04:00.159> it's<00:04:00.370> very

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:00.639 
chemicals so it is solid but it's very

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:04.229 
chemicals so it is solid but it's very
very<00:04:01.000> fragile<00:04:01.709> and<00:04:02.709> so<00:04:03.010> I<00:04:03.040> can<00:04:03.400> literally<00:04:03.790> pull

00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:02.759 
stomach the top end of the stomach has a

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:05.689 
stomach the top end of the stomach has a
really<00:06:03.089> interesting<00:06:03.119> feature<00:06:04.699> and

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:05.699 
really interesting feature and

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:08.540 
really interesting feature and
fortunately<00:06:06.509> I<00:06:06.899> will<00:06:07.680> lift<00:06:07.830> it<00:06:07.979> up<00:06:08.099> so<00:06:08.279> you<00:06:08.339> can

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
fortunately I will lift it up so you can

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.920 
fortunately I will lift it up so you can
see<00:06:08.729> it<00:06:08.819> in<00:06:08.939> a<00:06:08.999> moment<00:06:11.270> the<00:06:12.270> stomach<00:06:12.659> is<00:06:12.779> empty

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930 
see it in a moment the stomach is empty

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:26.179 
see it in a moment the stomach is empty
it's<00:06:13.800> not<00:06:13.919> like<00:06:14.099> first<00:06:14.399> period<00:06:23.839> theory<00:06:24.979> or<00:06:25.979> my

00:06:26.179 --> 00:06:26.189 
it's not like first period theory or my

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:28.070 
it's not like first period theory or my
thought<00:06:26.490> is<00:06:26.699> that<00:06:26.729> these<00:06:27.059> are<00:06:27.389> farm-raised

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 
thought is that these are farm-raised

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.259 
thought is that these are farm-raised
and<00:06:28.499> they<00:06:28.740> feed<00:06:29.039> them<00:06:29.279> shrimp<00:06:29.789> and<00:06:29.999> they<00:06:30.059> feed

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:30.269 
and they feed them shrimp and they feed

00:06:30.269 --> 00:06:34.219 
and they feed them shrimp and they feed
them<00:06:30.449> fish<00:06:30.659> parts<00:06:31.110> so<00:06:31.879> intestine<00:06:32.879> here<00:06:33.300> bright

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:34.229 
them fish parts so intestine here bright

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:36.139 
them fish parts so intestine here bright
pink<00:06:34.649> color<00:06:35.009> that<00:06:35.580> should<00:06:35.789> tell<00:06:35.999> you

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:36.149 
pink color that should tell you

00:06:36.149 --> 00:06:38.629 
pink color that should tell you
something<00:06:36.199> the<00:06:37.199> stomach<00:06:37.589> here<00:06:37.800> not<00:06:38.069> so<00:06:38.339> much

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:38.639 
something the stomach here not so much

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:42.769 
something the stomach here not so much
the<00:06:39.209> stomach<00:06:39.629> is<00:06:39.779> very<00:06:40.019> thick<00:06:40.559> now<00:06:40.800> watch<00:06:41.779> I'm

00:06:42.769 --> 00:06:42.779 
the stomach is very thick now watch I'm

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:46.249 
the stomach is very thick now watch I'm
amazed<00:06:43.169> with<00:06:43.379> both<00:06:43.680> of<00:06:43.860> these<00:06:43.949> organs<00:06:45.229> so<00:06:46.229> I

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:46.259 
amazed with both of these organs so I

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:48.469 
amazed with both of these organs so I
separated<00:06:46.559> the<00:06:47.039> stomach<00:06:47.459> from<00:06:47.639> the<00:06:47.729> intestine

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 
separated the stomach from the intestine

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:51.829 
separated the stomach from the intestine
the<00:06:49.219> green<00:06:50.219> stuff<00:06:50.550> is<00:06:50.759> the<00:06:51.059> fact<00:06:51.360> that<00:06:51.449> it<00:06:51.629> was

00:06:51.829 --> 00:06:51.839 
the green stuff is the fact that it was

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:56.379 
the green stuff is the fact that it was
up<00:06:52.110> against<00:06:52.620> this<00:06:52.939> organ<00:06:53.939> next<00:06:54.629> to<00:06:54.779> the<00:06:55.069> liver

00:06:56.379 --> 00:06:56.389 
up against this organ next to the liver

00:06:56.389 --> 00:06:59.649 
up against this organ next to the liver
and<00:06:57.389> I<00:06:57.479> believe<00:06:57.839> that<00:06:58.050> is<00:06:58.289> the<00:06:58.499> gallbladder<00:06:59.249> is

00:06:59.649 --> 00:06:59.659 
and I believe that is the gallbladder is

00:06:59.659 --> 00:07:03.289 
and I believe that is the gallbladder is
that<00:07:00.659> the
