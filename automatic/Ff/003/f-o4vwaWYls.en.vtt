00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:11.640
 louis christoph goetz what a 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.240
 distributor with the new samsung galaxy s 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:17.599
 4g smartphone for the year 2013 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.220
 It comes with a 5 inch qhd display 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:22.470
 super amoled technology integrates that 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.480
 means we have a really great here 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.089
 good display with a high brightness 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.249
 and also very nice and beautiful 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:31.019
 strong colors like it is here too 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:33.720
 maybe a video can recognize 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.270
 The device is only 7 9 millimeters 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.040
 thin and is also very good in the name 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.130
 principle similar to what the s3 is for 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.860
 even narrower at 68.9 millimeters and 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.240
 with 130 grams even easier on 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.430
 the top we have here under 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.440
 others exactly speaker as well as some 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.660
 sensors and of course a 2 megapixel 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.370
 camera on the front on the 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.530
 bottom we have more capacitive here 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.810
 buttons for back options and one 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.060
 physical home button on the back 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:03.060
 Here we are a 3 10 megapixel camera 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.890
 and the led flash otherwise only fell 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.140
 a speaker and here an e-mail 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.020
 or with the usb connection 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.149
 This frame is not an aluminum strap 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.009
 Maybe that's what the device believes 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:16.170
 basically only exists 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.850
 polycarbonate in itself of the performance 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.329
 It's a very good one 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.219
 impression 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:23.130
 we have two gigabytes here 

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:26.670
 memory android and also a 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.499
 new law or similar type as one 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.590
 and but knows but with 

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:33.359
 some features more important here too 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.119
 the internal memory can be like the 

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:38.189
 samsung galaxy s3 will be expanded and 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.300
 Let's take a look at the battery cover 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.950
 we do not either 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.860
 for me the highlight and all 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.830
 2600 milliampere provide market-that is, 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.500
 only really bigger is with 1 6 ghz resp 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.040
 htc from you of battery life not quite 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.770
 be so good 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:58.020
 here on the micro sd slot for microsd 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:01.440
 slot we have a smartphone that here 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.080
 means it supports as I said soon 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.730
 We also have some more sensors 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.010
 among other things temperature and 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.410
 humidity sensor or on one 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.810
 parameter and the device comes along 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.950
 some software features 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.620
 or other features 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.660
 which we will be short for you now and 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:23.550
 another estate with this tool 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:25.590
 can you translate text and the whole 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.290
 then from English for example or from 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.510
 German and Japanese or sorted 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.710
 really i tell myself to do everything as you do 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.370
 it also showed some here 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.110
 camera features 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.150
 for example, like and video recordings 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.860
 at the same time on the front 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.269
 and be recorded on the back 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.010
 which is also very convenient 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.010
 there are then various effects 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.270
 what's up 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:02.720
 a camera role she should go too 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:04.790
 very design is the first step 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.710
 but with very many cameras 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.710
 features further 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.910
 because the display explains the input 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.610
 For example , not for now 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.610
 the rics has a small preview 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.310
 concert is not quite like it 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.750
 is wanted 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.370
 but we have already seen it 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.040
 also worked with another 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.210
 Model works, however, I prefer 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.850
 now probably a bit too much 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.860
 definitely very interesting feature 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.760
 especially when surfing the Internet should that 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.860
 also be very good 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.710
 another feature is that you have the 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:56.320
 can see videos and the device recognizes 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:59.740
 on whether you really watch the video 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:03.580
 or if you wake up and that in the 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:05.130
 Principle very handy if you really 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.630
 I would like to watch many videos though 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:11.830
 Nothing miss any scenes now 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:14.110
 yes that 's the samsung galaxy s 4 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.340
 really a highlight device from the end 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.380
 this is available april 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:26.310
 i am christ of pediatrics see and 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:30.390

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.390
 Consti one for everything
