the audio controls we can also connect
this<00:02:21.590> in<00:02:21.890> addition<00:02:22.190> not<00:02:22.610> just<00:02:22.910> to<00:02:23.060> bluetooth

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
this in addition not just to bluetooth

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:24.940 
this in addition not just to bluetooth
speakers<00:02:23.989> in<00:02:24.170> general<00:02:24.470> but<00:02:24.590> also<00:02:24.650> to

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
speakers in general but also to

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.430 
speakers in general but also to
headphones<00:02:25.220> so<00:02:25.760> for<00:02:25.910> example<00:02:26.269> we<00:02:26.360> have<00:02:26.569> a<00:02:26.599> pair

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
headphones so for example we have a pair

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.830 
headphones so for example we have a pair
of<00:02:27.470> Zorro<00:02:28.129> 2<00:02:28.250> HD<00:02:28.819> headphones<00:02:29.209> over<00:02:29.300> here<00:02:29.629> and

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
of Zorro 2 HD headphones over here and

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.449 
of Zorro 2 HD headphones over here and
I've<00:02:29.930> connected<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:30.560> wireless<00:02:31.220> receiver

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
I've connected the wireless receiver

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.670 
I've connected the wireless receiver
into<00:02:32.180> the<00:02:32.299> headphone<00:02:32.480> port<00:02:32.660> and<00:02:33.170> now<00:02:33.530> I've

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
into the headphone port and now I've

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.589 
into the headphone port and now I've
basically<00:02:34.040> transformed<00:02:34.610> a<00:02:34.819> wired<00:02:35.090> pair<00:02:35.450> of

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
basically transformed a wired pair of

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.240 
basically transformed a wired pair of
headphones<00:02:35.840> into<00:02:36.349> a<00:02:36.379> wireless<00:02:36.860> bluetooth

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
headphones into a wireless bluetooth

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.860 
headphones into a wireless bluetooth
headphone<00:02:37.580> which<00:02:37.790> is<00:02:37.879> pretty<00:02:38.060> cool<00:02:38.299> and<00:02:38.569> so

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
headphone which is pretty cool and so

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.570 
headphone which is pretty cool and so
now<00:02:38.959> anything<00:02:39.319> that<00:02:39.500> I<00:02:39.590> play<00:02:39.830> on<00:02:40.040> my<00:02:40.190> smart

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
now anything that I play on my smart

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.350 
now anything that I play on my smart
phone<00:02:40.610> or<00:02:40.879> tablet

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
phone or tablet

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.930 
phone or tablet
for<00:02:42.049> example<00:02:42.470> I<00:02:42.680> have<00:02:42.830> a<00:02:42.860> youtube<00:02:43.340> video<00:02:43.459> or

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
for example I have a youtube video or

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.610 
for example I have a youtube video or
maybe<00:02:44.120> a<00:02:44.239> piece<00:02:44.599> of<00:02:44.750> music<00:02:44.810> I<00:02:45.049> wanted<00:02:45.290> to<00:02:45.379> play

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
maybe a piece of music I wanted to play

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.140 
maybe a piece of music I wanted to play
it's<00:02:46.370> not<00:02:46.400> going<00:02:46.610> to<00:02:46.670> be<00:02:46.730> playing<00:02:46.940> back

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
it's not going to be playing back

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.500 
it's not going to be playing back
through<00:02:48.079> the<00:02:48.349> headphones<00:02:48.890> sound<00:02:49.760> because<00:02:50.360> for

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
through the headphones sound because for

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.250 
through the headphones sound because for
the<00:02:50.599> interesting<00:02:50.959> so<00:02:51.079> I<00:02:51.110> can<00:02:51.230> turn<00:02:51.349> that<00:02:51.410> up

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
the interesting so I can turn that up

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.080 
the interesting so I can turn that up
and<00:02:54.260> kind<00:02:54.500> of<00:02:54.530> hear<00:02:54.769> through<00:02:55.099> the<00:02:55.220> headphones

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
and kind of hear through the headphones

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.240 
and kind of hear through the headphones
themselves<00:02:56.590> generally<00:02:57.590> I<00:02:57.739> would<00:02:57.950> say<00:02:58.069> the

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
themselves generally I would say the

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.710 
themselves generally I would say the
music<00:02:58.340> performance<00:02:58.970> using<00:02:59.269> the<00:02:59.390> Bluetooth

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
music performance using the Bluetooth

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.539 
music performance using the Bluetooth
receiver<00:02:59.989> is<00:03:00.410> good<00:03:00.739> there's<00:03:01.040> a<00:03:01.099> slight<00:03:01.400> amount

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
receiver is good there's a slight amount

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.100 
receiver is good there's a slight amount
of<00:03:01.700> static<00:03:02.090> in<00:03:02.180> the<00:03:02.209> background<00:03:02.299> so<00:03:02.870> it's<00:03:02.989> not

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
of static in the background so it's not

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.050 
of static in the background so it's not
as<00:03:03.290> clear<00:03:03.650> as<00:03:03.890> using<00:03:04.220> the<00:03:04.370> traditional<00:03:04.549> wired

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
as clear as using the traditional wired

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.030 
as clear as using the traditional wired
format<00:03:05.510> but<00:03:06.049> as<00:03:06.290> opposed<00:03:06.650> to<00:03:06.709> some<00:03:06.920> other

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
format but as opposed to some other

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.979 
format but as opposed to some other
Bluetooth<00:03:08.000> receivers<00:03:08.420> in<00:03:08.540> general<00:03:08.870> I<00:03:08.959> think

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
Bluetooth receivers in general I think

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:10.420 
Bluetooth receivers in general I think
that<00:03:09.200> key<00:03:09.410> docks<00:03:09.590> did<00:03:09.769> a<00:03:09.799> pretty<00:03:10.010> good<00:03:10.160> job<00:03:10.220> in

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
that key docks did a pretty good job in

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.009 
that key docks did a pretty good job in
song<00:03:10.819> ecology<00:03:11.209> it's<00:03:11.329> generally<00:03:11.750> pleasing

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
song ecology it's generally pleasing

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.289 
song ecology it's generally pleasing
it's<00:03:12.560> rich<00:03:12.890> it's<00:03:13.160> responsive<00:03:13.790> and<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:14.030> range

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
it's rich it's responsive and the range

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:15.970 
it's rich it's responsive and the range
is<00:03:14.480> really<00:03:14.540> really<00:03:15.110> strong<00:03:15.410> even<00:03:15.769> though<00:03:15.829> the

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
is really really strong even though the

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.680 
is really really strong even though the
manufacturer<00:03:16.519> advertises<00:03:17.239> that<00:03:17.269> the<00:03:17.480> range

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
manufacturer advertises that the range

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.199 
manufacturer advertises that the range
is<00:03:17.959> around<00:03:18.319> 10<00:03:19.010> meters<00:03:19.310> or<00:03:19.459> so<00:03:19.670> we<00:03:19.880> found<00:03:20.090> that

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
is around 10 meters or so we found that

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:21.610 
is around 10 meters or so we found that
it<00:03:20.329> could<00:03:20.450> actually<00:03:20.480> be<00:03:20.720> extended<00:03:21.170> further<00:03:21.350> in

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
it could actually be extended further in

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.770 
it could actually be extended further in
many<00:03:21.769> cases<00:03:22.280> I<00:03:22.459> could<00:03:22.910> leave<00:03:23.060> my<00:03:23.090> smartphone

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
many cases I could leave my smartphone

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.059 
many cases I could leave my smartphone
which<00:03:23.959> is<00:03:24.079> connected<00:03:24.470> to<00:03:24.500> the<00:03:24.650> receiver<00:03:24.980> in

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 
which is connected to the receiver in

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:26.770 
which is connected to the receiver in
one<00:03:25.400> room<00:03:25.609> and<00:03:25.760> then<00:03:25.940> I<00:03:26.030> can<00:03:26.180> walk<00:03:26.299> around<00:03:26.480> with

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
one room and then I can walk around with

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.840 
one room and then I can walk around with
my<00:03:26.900> headphones<00:03:27.230> or<00:03:27.889> maybe<00:03:28.069> my<00:03:28.220> speaker<00:03:28.519> set

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
my headphones or maybe my speaker set

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.819 
my headphones or maybe my speaker set
downstairs<00:03:29.720> or<00:03:29.989> upstairs<00:03:30.019> and<00:03:30.739> the

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
downstairs or upstairs and the

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:32.680 
downstairs or upstairs and the
connection<00:03:31.220> range<00:03:31.430> is<00:03:31.639> so<00:03:31.849> relatively<00:03:32.359> strong

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
connection range is so relatively strong

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.330 
connection range is so relatively strong
so<00:03:32.989> it's<00:03:33.109> great<00:03:33.290> if<00:03:33.440> you<00:03:33.530> have<00:03:33.560> a<00:03:33.709> longer

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
so it's great if you have a longer

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.069 
so it's great if you have a longer
connection<00:03:34.910> that<00:03:35.000> you<00:03:35.120> need<00:03:35.269> to<00:03:35.480> have<00:03:35.810> a<00:03:35.840> set

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
connection that you need to have a set

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:37.900 
connection that you need to have a set
up<00:03:36.170> as<00:03:36.319> well<00:03:36.530> so<00:03:36.709> overall<00:03:37.160> I<00:03:37.370> would<00:03:37.489> say<00:03:37.549> this

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
up as well so overall I would say this

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.430 
up as well so overall I would say this
is<00:03:38.090> a<00:03:38.120> pretty<00:03:38.420> compelling<00:03:38.840> purchase<00:03:39.290> if

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
is a pretty compelling purchase if

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.729 
is a pretty compelling purchase if
