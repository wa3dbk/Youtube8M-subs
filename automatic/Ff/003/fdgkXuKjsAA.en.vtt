00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
as Republicans go you know why this is

something we should champion Andrew it's
for<00:04:02.660> the<00:04:02.720> same<00:04:02.930> reason<00:04:02.959> I<00:04:03.350> did<00:04:03.709> this<00:04:03.739> piece

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
for the same reason I did this piece

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.460 
for the same reason I did this piece
because<00:04:04.160> we<00:04:04.610> can<00:04:04.820> tell<00:04:05.060> a<00:04:05.090> story<00:04:05.450> here<00:04:05.840> we<00:04:06.260> can

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
because we can tell a story here we can

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.890 
because we can tell a story here we can
show<00:04:06.680> people<00:04:07.040> we<00:04:07.430> so<00:04:07.640> often<00:04:07.880> talk<00:04:08.239> about<00:04:08.269> these

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
show people we so often talk about these

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.410 
show people we so often talk about these
books<00:04:09.200> you've<00:04:09.350> got<00:04:09.470> over<00:04:09.650> here<00:04:09.709> Basquiat<00:04:10.250> I

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
books you've got over here Basquiat I

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.630 
books you've got over here Basquiat I
think<00:04:11.420> it<00:04:11.750> has<00:04:11.870> lost<00:04:12.260> on<00:04:12.500> a<00:04:12.530> lot<00:04:12.739> of<00:04:12.829> people<00:04:12.980> but

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
think it has lost on a lot of people but

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.030 
think it has lost on a lot of people but
stories<00:04:14.150> resonate<00:04:14.870> and<00:04:15.019> Democrats<00:04:15.680> always

stories resonate and Democrats always

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.440 
stories resonate and Democrats always
have<00:04:16.190> stories<00:04:16.609> because<00:04:16.910> they<00:04:17.000> always<00:04:17.299> have

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
have stories because they always have

does a couple things that shows what we

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.290 
does a couple things that shows what we
stand<00:04:21.380> for<00:04:21.530> in<00:04:21.830> the<00:04:22.190> hypocrisy<00:04:22.520> of<00:04:22.880> what<00:04:23.180> they

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
stand for in the hypocrisy of what they

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.200 
stand for in the hypocrisy of what they
do<00:04:23.360> not<00:04:23.690> stand<00:04:24.050> for<00:04:24.140> despite<00:04:25.070> what<00:04:25.250> they<00:04:25.400> say
