 Hello everyone, today I will show my room tour 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.650
 by number in vein and let's get started 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:18.180
 Welcome 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:23.130
 so let's start with what we have here 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:26.430
 in the hallway here we have different shelves 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.500
 where can you rely to any yes means 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.410
 here we have hangers where you can hang 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.140
 clothing, or some dress jackets yah 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.590
 how god pleases us here 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.040
 safe and mini bar and safe and here's the fridge 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:44.280
 here we have plain water mineral juice 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:48.960
 coca cola beer chips 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:52.230
 waffle opener all that we and 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.760
 by the way price but it is written here very much 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.070
 such an interesting form 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:02.309
 on the bottle yes that means from this side 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.379
 here we can hang some either 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.960
 jackets or bags yes as you like 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.320
 the only thing that is bad here is that there 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.060
 no cabinets so everything is stored in 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.490
 the suitcases are very good but if you 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.460
 actually come here for a couple of days 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.070
 then I think no problem 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.320
 this question can be solved there on the door 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.049
 there is a mirror and I will not show you 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.060
 on the mirror but there is a mirror and so 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.270
 we pass into the bath here with us 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.189
 big solid sink here 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.549

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:38.820
 some kind of cosmetics yes there spirit 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:43.350
 and every such thing is very much 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.130
 by the way comfortable napkins here is a small thing 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.920
 but nice 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.049
 there is also a mirror up in which she 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.439
 there are magnifying ordinary in it then 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:55.110
 You can make the battleship bouncing as 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.200
 what would you like yes here we have 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.540

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.630
 there is a comb on the sofa shelf 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:07.590

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:10.319
 lovely hook is so lovely hanging 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.020
 hair dryer which is issued here is written 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.990
 Kamaz 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.700
 me joy scent here and here by the way effect to 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.800
 very thoroughly usually know in 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.800
 rooms such foam and not very 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.660
 cheap if he really is 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:26.140
 solid is called black mamba 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.060
 feared his joules here and by the way me 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.600
 liked the foam so very much so 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.020
 not bad 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.240
 here such a bucket just doesn't seem to 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.570
 I know the task was brought or the cleaning lady forgot 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.920
 this is for garbage and for this 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:43.000
 here we have a partition 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:45.940
 actually tolik yes so there is 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.810
 warm floor and there is an adjustment 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:52.990
 here, respectively, hooks with a towel 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:57.240
 that means here we have such a stool 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:03:01.120
 where can I put a towel this 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:03.910
 start the actual stuff here 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.640
 glass but here everything is so 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.740
 closes and everything is tight nothing 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.410
 proceeds 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.640
 it means so well, respectively 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.910
 naive by the way it seems very very 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.190
 small but his pressure is excellent and me 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.230
 really like it probably the most 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.240
 important information about something like or 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.090
 I don't like stifling 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:30.010
 Okay, and we ’ll come by the way here 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:35.520
 glass and as if with this glass there is one 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.520
 focus now i'll show it let's go a 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:44.230
 actually as if here we can it 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:49.150
 so here is dad and we open it all there 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:51.010
 would see you wait for me here so i like 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.470

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.450
 what 's hot here please can not 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:59.100
 shut up but I'm still somehow 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:02.350
 I prefer to close and let's close 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.150
 so nozzle let's move the room for 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.310
 start probably show this one just 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:10.150
 stunning lamp shade which i fell in love 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:12.420
 He then such knitted so I do not know of it 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.830
 just awesome that ocher color 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.770
 amazingly i like this 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:20.080
 yes idea of ​​the floor here by the way concrete 

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:21.640
 cold which is not very convenient but the bath 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.290
 heated as I said and here 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.510
 the only thing here is this 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.990
 mat on how 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:31.820
 Aroma how can you warm the boards like that 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:34.320
 so here's the bed there is a big one 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.360
 elongated for me with my meter 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.250
 sixty is very important because i 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.290
 always torment myself with these little ones 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.710
 the beds are just some kind of nightmare 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:45.180
 beds are soft and high by the way they are yes in 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.950
 style know american then what 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.250
 American beds are not always high 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:52.050
 I even need to go straight to her for important 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:54.510
 jump but actually this question 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.660
 or I somehow easily solved the blanket 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.420
 by the way here are very soft warm and this 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.890
 very cool because usually when 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:04.500
 going somewhere south there is always there 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:07.050
 the blanket is quite thin as they have 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.320
 hot and no matter how warm 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.870
 I love the blanket so soft 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:15.600
 Here we have such a beautiful track 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:18.690
 scenery we are yes and here is such an elephant 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:22.530
 which can be bought for 49 euros to yourself 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:25.350
 the memory is here on our wall hanging 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:27.900
 Elji plasma TV sat scientifically 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.790
 I somehow do not use them at all 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:33.180
 By the way I want to note that the bed is still 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:36.960
 very cool legs and here we have 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:39.330
 actually table lamp lamp is also like 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.930
 usually quite interesting and 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:45.720
 accordingly a chair when here too 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:48.840
 such a thing aiham yes where you can 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:51.330
 connect your ipod ipod iphone yes 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:54.360
 dry the music set alarms 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:56.250
 and in general such and may not know 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:59.970
 maybe here it is possible to catch honestly 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:04.320
 speaking for and here comes this as well as here 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:06.750
 we have a phone but yes by the way here too 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.820
 the bucket is very interesting then legs know how 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.920
 as if in it and I do not know there cucumbers 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.460
 collected or even general regular hello 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.910
 change 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:18.680
 so here we have 2 for tulle and 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:20.260
 window and then opens and you can 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:25.480
 feel 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:27.660
 venula it except here there are more such 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:31.000
 thick curtains that can be closed 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:35.680
 yes and at night then I will sleep very sweetly 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.930
 and in the morning you could use the sun here is 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.760
 mean so bedside this 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.870
 also quite unusual like everything in 

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.600
 this hotel however 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:45.340
 they are quite low spicy here 

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:47.820
 sit for a rest or something 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:51.790
 lay out here as well there is such a very 

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:53.650
 funny pillow by the way there is still 

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:55.900
 small pillows on which on one 

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:59.440
 written by avastami on the other hand penza 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:01.570
 find gene 2 means lamp here 

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.400
 natural enough here 

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:07.210
 all sorts of on and off or sockets 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:10.060
 and probably the apotheosis of this number to 

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:12.550
 The main feature of his probably the fact that you really 

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:17.070
 noticed this wall is just awesome she 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:19.510
 quite unusual let's say so 

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:21.010
 so to speak design hotels 

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:24.220
 so here is a design solution 

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:28.050
 each room has different pictures and 

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:31.060
 I got such miracles 

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:34.750
 the picture here but in fact its sometimes 

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:36.340
 interesting poizuchat look what you 

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:38.920
 when you start last you start 

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:41.050
 see already a lot of details well 

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:43.150
 actually probably that's all i'm you 

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:44.620
 showed in my room hope you 

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:46.990

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:48.790
 video and Bunny channel I got 

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:52.180
 me corsi i talked a lot of nonsense

 Well, I do not know in general, I wish you good 

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:56.200
