00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:14.380
 good webb all kids other unboxing 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:16.059
 and today a childhood game that I hope 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.840
 that someone has played at least one 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.060
 time in your life 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:23.470
 I'm not saying this may already be anyone 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:25.610
 of the whole series since the takedowns in 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.170
 boy color advanced 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.690
 is a saga that has gone through all 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.630
 all the consoles that have been of 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:36.010
 nintendo of course and well this is what 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.010
 which brings as you can see simply 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.800
 the leading drifter the coach's guide 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.800
 like all of them, more or less it gives us a 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.470
 little the history index 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.550
 explains us here more or less the beginnings 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.700
 of pokemon because you have to have in 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.000
 realize that this is actually the third 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.890
 game released by pokemon the first one was 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.780
 red and blue e at the same time 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.540
 they were the first to leave together 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.460
 the green in japan the blue you think 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.560
 neither is it in Japan here came the 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.400
 blue instead of green and in japan the 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.400
 green instead of blue 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.640
 Here he explains everything about the envelope 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:20.710
 pikachu that is the novelty of this game 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.049
 with respect to the previous ones 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.210
 in the novelty is the novelty is that we 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.740
 brings as if it were the pokemon series 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:31.240
 that we have all seen in the 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:34.390
 tele and that here the only thing that 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.690
 has this pokemon 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:41.140
 it's the only different thing that has what 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.400
 serves a pikachu and well yes yes I think 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.640
 also that has something different some 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.650
 part of the plot but little else I do not 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.970
 It seems that you have nothing different to 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.990
 emphasize it well also that 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.060
 obviously we touch initial first 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.400
 it's pikachu and as we go forward 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.870
 the adventure we get without needing 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.780
 exchange with anyone because the three 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:05.360
 Main pokemon are vulva south charm 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.280
 under and 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.500
 and skrtel 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.480
 well here we see that more gives us 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.030
 information about a little adventure 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.160
 gym leaders 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.630
 he will know about tips as he catches 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.630
 let's touch the link link 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.090
 and good a little pokÃ©dex to see 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:29.430
 here the pokemon there 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.430
 and that after here we have 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.180
 the game 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.050
 like any of yellow 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.740
 and the box that we use something weird there for 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.040
 watch 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:49.530
 today four euros cost us in 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.720
 the cash converters although I got bad at 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.660
 reality because in the game did not put 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.080
 here as you see nintendo game boy what 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.170
 I put nothing 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:02.690
 and then a friend of mine gave me 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:05.720
 this and I kept the box 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.940
 and then this is what this classic has 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.040
 game and if you have not tried it 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.100
 I recommend you try it because the bitch 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.750
 host 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.080
 so this is all kids until the 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.080
 next
