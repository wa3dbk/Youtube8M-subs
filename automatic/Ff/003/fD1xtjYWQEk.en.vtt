16 last year they receive 0% and 13
through<00:01:11.880> 14<00:01:12.110> also<00:01:13.110> get<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.070> little<00:01:14.729> bit<00:01:14.880> more

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
through 14 also get a little bit more

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.359 
through 14 also get a little bit more
and<00:01:15.390> nine<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.930> 12<00:01:16.200> also<00:01:16.500> get<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.890> lot<00:01:16.950> more<00:01:17.189> than

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
and nine to 12 also get a lot more than

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.390 
and nine to 12 also get a lot more than
they<00:01:17.640> did<00:01:17.700> before<00:01:18.200> so<00:01:19.200> i<00:01:19.439> think<00:01:19.770> overall<00:01:20.009> it's

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
they did before so i think overall it's

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.039

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
stage it is a 14 double elimination

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.789 
stage it is a 14 double elimination
bracket<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.520> top<00:01:42.240> two<00:01:42.479> teams<00:01:42.780> advance<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.649> the

eliminated all matches our best of three

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.100 
eliminated all matches our best of three
so<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.200> means<00:01:49.380> one<00:01:49.950> two<00:01:50.430> three<00:01:51.270> four<00:01:51.810> five

so that means one two three four five

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.910 
so that means one two three four five
matches<00:01:52.979> five<00:01:53.340> bo<00:01:53.549> threes<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.880> one<00:01:54.119> day<00:01:54.329> is

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
matches five bo threes a one day is

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.550 
matches five bo threes a one day is
unlikely<00:01:55.920> going<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.700> not<00:01:57.630> run<00:01:57.930> concurrently

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.990 
unlikely going to not run concurrently
so<00:01:58.829> I<00:01:58.860> think<00:01:59.070> at<00:01:59.340> least<00:01:59.460> two<00:01:59.670> of<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.820> matches

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
so I think at least two of the matches

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.730 
so I think at least two of the matches
will<00:02:00.210> be<00:02:00.240> played<00:02:00.360> at<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.140> same<00:02:01.350> time<00:02:01.500> most

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
will be played at the same time most

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.249 
will be played at the same time most
likely<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:02.040> beast<00:02:02.759> too<00:02:03.439> so<00:02:05.990> nothing<00:02:06.990> too

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
likely a beast too so nothing too

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.469 
likely a beast too so nothing too

so<00:05:18.400> this<00:05:19.000> should<00:05:19.270> be<00:05:19.300> significantly<00:05:20.139> improved

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
so this should be significantly improved

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.689 
so this should be significantly improved
from<00:05:21.520> ti4<00:05:22.150> for<00:05:22.870> several<00:05:23.169> reasons<00:05:23.349> firstly<00:05:24.190> i

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:24.699 
from ti4 for several reasons firstly i

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.180 
from ti4 for several reasons firstly i
think<00:05:25.270> the<00:05:25.360> all-star<00:05:25.870> match<00:05:26.289> being<00:05:26.800> two<00:05:27.009> days

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
think the all-star match being two days

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.010 
think the all-star match being two days
away<00:05:27.310> from<00:05:27.370> the<00:05:27.550> main<00:05:27.699> event<00:05:27.879> is<00:05:28.180> a<00:05:28.509> good<00:05:28.840> thing

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
away from the main event is a good thing

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.610 
away from the main event is a good thing
because<00:05:29.759> i<00:05:30.759> like<00:05:31.479> having<00:05:31.690> like<00:05:32.229> all<00:05:32.469> the

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
because i like having like all the

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.140 
because i like having like all the
matches<00:05:32.979> day<00:05:33.190> before<00:05:33.490> i<00:05:33.520> think<00:05:33.759> it<00:05:33.849> generates

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
matches day before i think it generates

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.550 
matches day before i think it generates

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:46.800 
one you'll find out right before the
grand<00:05:45.400> finals<00:05:45.849> so<00:05:45.940> I<00:05:45.969> think<00:05:46.120> that<00:05:46.300> leads<00:05:46.599> it

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
grand finals so I think that leads it

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.219 
grand finals so I think that leads it
leads<00:05:47.800> to<00:05:48.039> a<00:05:48.069> much<00:05:48.460> more<00:05:48.699> exciting<00:05:49.449> conclusion

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:50.229 
leads to a much more exciting conclusion

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:53.159 
leads to a much more exciting conclusion
of<00:05:50.830> an<00:05:50.979> event<00:05:51.219> but<00:05:51.580> i<00:05:51.789> think<00:05:52.120> the<00:05:52.210> ti3<00:05:52.509> format

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:53.169 
of an event but i think the ti3 format

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:56.459 
of an event but i think the ti3 format
was<00:05:54.180> met<00:05:55.180> with<00:05:55.210> resounding<00:05:55.719> success<00:05:56.319> i'm

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:57.930 
was met with resounding success i'm
actually<00:05:56.650> surprised<00:05:57.099> they<00:05:57.279> switch<00:05:57.520> it<00:05:57.639> up<00:05:57.729> a

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:57.940 
actually surprised they switch it up a

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.540 
actually surprised they switch it up a
lot<00:05:58.389> for<00:05:58.599> TI<00:05:58.779> for<00:05:59.110> button<00:05:59.469> going<00:06:00.370> back<00:06:00.520> to
