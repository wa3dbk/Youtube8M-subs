so<00:06:21.479> I<00:06:21.509> would<00:06:21.780> say<00:06:21.990> this<00:06:22.199> app<00:06:22.440> has<00:06:22.919> to<00:06:22.949> be<00:06:23.310> the

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:23.520 
so I would say this app has to be the

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.149 
so I would say this app has to be the
one<00:06:23.729> that<00:06:24.210> collects<00:06:24.599> the<00:06:24.780> most<00:06:24.990> data<00:06:25.229> so<00:06:25.949> guys

00:06:26.149 --> 00:06:26.159 
one that collects the most data so guys

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:28.040
