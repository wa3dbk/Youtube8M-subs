00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390 
you push the ok button on this little

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.020 
you push the ok button on this little
d-pad<00:04:37.810> here<00:04:38.020> and<00:04:38.290> then<00:04:39.190> you<00:04:39.340> get<00:04:39.460> ready<00:04:39.700> to<00:04:39.880> go

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
d-pad here and then you get ready to go

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.420

and<00:04:40.330> if<00:04:40.540> you<00:04:40.630> mess<00:04:40.810> up<00:04:40.840> it<00:04:41.350> goes<00:04:41.890> to<00:04:42.100> read<00:04:42.280> you

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
and if you mess up it goes to read you

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.650 
and if you mess up it goes to read you
start<00:04:42.670> over<00:04:42.880> just<00:04:43.660> neat<00:04:43.870> little<00:04:44.020> thing<00:04:44.140> there

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
start over just neat little thing there

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.690 
start over just neat little thing there
but<00:04:46.660> also<00:04:47.380> this<00:04:47.800> one<00:04:48.040> does<00:04:48.250> come<00:04:48.430> equipped

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
but also this one does come equipped

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.360 
but also this one does come equipped
with<00:04:48.760> a<00:04:48.880> hill<00:04:49.150> start<00:04:49.870> assist<00:04:50.070> which<00:04:51.070> if<00:04:51.250> you're

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
with a hill start assist which if you're

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.860 
with a hill start assist which if you're
on<00:04:51.460> a<00:04:51.490> hill<00:04:51.820> and<00:04:52.090> then<00:04:52.330> you<00:04:52.390> got<00:04:52.510> the<00:04:52.600> Magnum

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
on a hill and then you got the Magnum

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.990 
on a hill and then you got the Magnum
transmission<00:04:53.380> and<00:04:53.770> you're<00:04:54.190> not<00:04:54.340> real<00:04:54.550> good<00:04:54.940> at

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
transmission and you're not real good at

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.150 
transmission and you're not real good at
it<00:04:55.180> yet<00:04:55.470> that's<00:04:56.470> a<00:04:56.590> really<00:04:56.830> neat<00:04:56.950> feature

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
it yet that's a really neat feature

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.560 
it yet that's a really neat feature
because<00:04:57.460> they<00:04:57.700> actually<00:04:57.850> holds<00:04:58.330> the<00:04:58.420> brake

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
because they actually holds the brake

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.210 
because they actually holds the brake
for<00:04:58.900> you<00:04:58.990> want<00:04:59.200> you<00:04:59.380> do<00:04:59.740> the<00:04:59.860> clutch<00:05:00.040> and<00:05:00.190> the

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
for you want you do the clutch and the

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.800 
for you want you do the clutch and the
guest<00:05:00.460> so<00:05:00.730> neat<00:05:01.180> little<00:05:01.300> thing<00:05:01.420> there<00:05:01.690> they

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
guest so neat little thing there they

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.590 
guest so neat little thing there they
did<00:05:02.310> there<00:05:03.310> is<00:05:03.460> your<00:05:03.580> radio<00:05:03.850> display<00:05:04.270> got<00:05:04.510> the

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
did there is your radio display got the

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.030 
did there is your radio display got the
compass<00:05:05.020> external<00:05:05.590> temperature<00:05:05.890> there

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
compass external temperature there

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.580 
compass external temperature there
shaker<00:05:06.700> sound<00:05:07.030> system<00:05:07.360> very<00:05:07.630> nice<00:05:07.900> system<00:05:08.440> got

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
shaker sound system very nice system got

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.040 
shaker sound system very nice system got
it's<00:05:08.830> loud<00:05:09.160> it's<00:05:09.460> got<00:05:09.610> plenty<00:05:09.730> of<00:05:09.910> Base<00:05:10.150> I<00:05:10.450> mean

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
it's loud it's got plenty of Base I mean

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
it's loud it's got plenty of Base I mean
you<00:05:11.170> shouldn't<00:05:11.380> have<00:05:11.500> to<00:05:11.560> do<00:05:11.650> anything<00:05:11.680> that

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
you shouldn't have to do anything that
