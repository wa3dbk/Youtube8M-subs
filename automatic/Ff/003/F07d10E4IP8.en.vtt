the<00:00:44.489> wing<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:44.940> really<00:00:45.539> really<00:00:45.690> easy<00:00:47.899> they<00:00:48.899> just

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
the wing is really really easy they just

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.920 
the wing is really really easy they just
snap<00:00:49.860> in<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.550> they<00:00:50.760> fit<00:00:51.000> really<00:00:51.420> really<00:00:51.989> tight

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
snap in and they fit really really tight

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.970 
snap in and they fit really really tight
some<00:00:54.930> people<00:00:55.170> who<00:00:55.260> only<00:00:55.379> want<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.649> glue<00:00:55.800> those

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
some people who only want to glue those

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.580 
some people who only want to glue those
in<00:00:56.190> there<00:00:56.370> but<00:00:57.180> if<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.480> glue<00:00:57.780> mine<00:00:58.079> in<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.440> have

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
in there but if I glue mine in and have

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.170 
in there but if I glue mine in and have
an<00:00:58.710> accident<00:00:59.010> I'd<00:00:59.309> rather<00:00:59.520> have<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.969> pop

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
an accident I'd rather have it to pop

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.779 
an accident I'd rather have it to pop
the<00:01:00.480> wheel<00:01:00.660> off<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.079> break<00:01:01.199> my<00:01:01.410> wing<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.829> I

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
the wheel off and break my wing and I

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.870 
the wheel off and break my wing and I
also<00:01:02.969> put<00:01:03.329> them<00:01:03.650> outward<00:01:04.650> instead<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.369> inward

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
also put them outward instead of inward

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.490 
also put them outward instead of inward
so<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.270> has<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.450> wider<00:01:06.810> stance<00:01:07.260> on<00:01:07.700> the<00:01:08.700> jet<00:01:09.500> in

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
so it has a wider stance on the jet in

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.410 
so it has a wider stance on the jet in
the<00:01:10.799> accessories<00:01:11.250> package<00:01:11.640> there<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:11.909> one<00:01:12.180> why

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
the accessories package there is one why

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.870 
the accessories package there is one why
harness<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.170> its<00:01:13.409> marked<00:01:13.860> aileron<00:01:14.400> on<00:01:14.640> there

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.219 
take it off its magnetic as I grab it to
one<00:01:47.909> side<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.450> kind<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.750> pull<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.049> whole

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
thing up the little magnets on there

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.819 
thing up the little magnets on there
these<00:01:53.729> are<00:01:53.850> taped<00:01:54.149> on<00:01:54.390> they<00:01:55.259> have<00:01:55.409> tape<00:01:55.649> on

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.380 
them and I suggest that put a little
drop<00:01:58.530> of<00:01:58.619> glue<00:01:58.890> under<00:01:59.430> each<00:01:59.579> of<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.880> magnets

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
drop of glue under each of the magnets

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.139 
drop of glue under each of the magnets
on<00:02:01.140> there<00:02:02.009> I<00:02:02.219> think<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.759> they're<00:02:02.909> going<00:02:03.030> to

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
on there I think that they're going to

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.830 
on there I think that they're going to
hold<00:02:03.240> better<00:02:03.509> these<00:02:03.930> also<00:02:04.140> are<00:02:04.530> just<00:02:04.860> taped<00:02:05.130> on

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
hold better these also are just taped on

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.510 
hold better these also are just taped on
one<00:02:06.840> drop<00:02:07.110> of<00:02:07.140> glue<00:02:07.409> on<00:02:07.740> each<00:02:08.099> of<00:02:08.250> them<00:02:08.369> will

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
one drop of glue on each of them will

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.070 
one drop of glue on each of them will
hold<00:02:08.700> them<00:02:08.819> on<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:08.970> really<00:02:09.179> good<00:02:09.479> otherwise

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
hold them on a really good otherwise

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.110 
hold them on a really good otherwise
it's<00:02:10.830> just<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:11.099> tape<00:02:11.280> holding<00:02:11.610> them<00:02:11.730> but<00:02:12.000> it's

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
it's just a tape holding them but it's

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.309 
it's just a tape holding them but it's
really<00:02:12.300> good<00:02:12.569> design<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:12.989> fits

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
really good design it fits

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.589 
really good design it fits
ison<00:02:13.590> looks<00:02:13.799> really<00:02:14.010> good<00:02:14.269> I'm<00:02:15.269> going<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.510> have

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
ison looks really good I'm going to have

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.319 
ison looks really good I'm going to have
to<00:02:15.629> mount<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.959> wing<00:02:16.140> and<00:02:16.760> push<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.939> aileron

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329 
to mount the wing and push the aileron

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:21.379 
to mount the wing and push the aileron
wires<00:02:18.599> through<00:02:19.049> this<00:02:19.200> hole<00:02:19.469> and<00:02:20.209> pull<00:02:21.209> it<00:02:21.299> out

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:21.389 
wires through this hole and pull it out

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:23.149 
wires through this hole and pull it out
right<00:02:21.569> there<00:02:21.840> that's<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.439> hardest<00:02:22.859> build<00:02:23.069> of

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
right there that's the hardest build of

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:25.520 
right there that's the hardest build of
a<00:02:23.219> whole<00:02:23.400> claim<00:02:23.749> honestly<00:02:24.749> it<00:02:24.959> says<00:02:25.170> great

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
a whole claim honestly it says great

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.080 
a whole claim honestly it says great
it's<00:02:25.709> fantastic<00:02:25.769> I<00:02:26.430> can't<00:02:26.609> believe<00:02:26.730> how<00:02:26.879> easy

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
it's fantastic I can't believe how easy

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.399 
it's fantastic I can't believe how easy
this<00:02:27.269> is<00:02:27.480> this<00:02:27.780> is<00:02:27.930> going<00:02:28.079> to<00:02:28.139> be<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.290> hardest

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
this is this is going to be the hardest

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:29.750 
this is this is going to be the hardest
part<00:02:28.739> is<00:02:28.769> putting<00:02:28.920> that<00:02:29.069> wing<00:02:29.310> through<00:02:29.579> there

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
part is putting that wing through there

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.610 
part is putting that wing through there
and<00:02:29.969> the<00:02:30.599> wire<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:31.079> I'm<00:02:31.200> going<00:02:31.379> to<00:02:31.409> show<00:02:31.560> you

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
and the wire and I'm going to show you

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:32.690 
and the wire and I'm going to show you
how<00:02:31.680> easy<00:02:31.769> that<00:02:32.159> really<00:02:32.400> going<00:02:32.549> to<00:02:32.609> be

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
how easy that really going to be

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.610 
how easy that really going to be
actually<00:02:32.909> so<00:02:33.480> that's<00:02:33.900> next<00:02:36.409> underneath<00:02:37.409> the

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
actually so that's next underneath the

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.770 
actually so that's next underneath the
belly<00:02:37.769> on<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.099> fuselage<00:02:38.639> there<00:02:39.269> is<00:02:39.389> a<00:02:39.419> hatch

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
belly on the fuselage there is a hatch

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.110 
belly on the fuselage there is a hatch
it<00:02:40.349> has<00:02:40.530> two<00:02:40.799> tiny<00:02:41.040> screws<00:02:41.459> I've<00:02:41.730> already<00:02:41.909> pre

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
it has two tiny screws I've already pre

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.580 
it has two tiny screws I've already pre
loose<00:02:42.299> in<00:02:42.450> mind<00:02:42.629> so<00:02:42.810> you<00:02:42.870> can<00:02:43.019> take<00:02:43.169> this<00:02:43.349> right

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
loose in mind so you can take this right

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.099 
loose in mind so you can take this right
off<00:02:43.739> of<00:02:43.769> here<00:02:44.209> this<00:02:45.209> also<00:02:45.419> allows<00:02:45.629> you<00:02:45.930> access

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
off of here this also allows you access

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:48.949 
off of here this also allows you access
to<00:02:46.439> the<00:02:46.739> EDF<00:02:47.579> brushless<00:02:48.090> motor<00:02:48.659> should

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
to the EDF brushless motor should

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.619 
to the EDF brushless motor should
something<00:02:49.200> happen<00:02:49.319> you<00:02:49.739> want<00:02:49.889> to<00:02:49.950> replace<00:02:50.219> it

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629 
something happen you want to replace it

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.270 
something happen you want to replace it
but<00:02:51.629> it's<00:02:52.199> a<00:02:52.349> good<00:02:52.500> way<00:02:52.620> to<00:02:52.650> get<00:02:52.799> the<00:02:52.949> wing<00:02:53.099> on

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
but it's a good way to get the wing on

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.929 
but it's a good way to get the wing on
and<00:02:53.609> I'll<00:02:53.879> show<00:02:53.909> you<00:02:54.120> why<00:02:55.699> I'll<00:02:56.699> take<00:02:56.879> that

00:02:56.929 --> 00:02:56.939 
and I'll show you why I'll take that

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:01.670 
and I'll show you why I'll take that
aileron<00:02:57.599> wire<00:02:58.790> I'm<00:02:59.790> just<00:03:00.409> working<00:03:01.409> with<00:03:01.500> one

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
aileron wire I'm just working with one

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.189 
aileron wire I'm just working with one
hand<00:03:01.859> and<00:03:02.040> let<00:03:02.159> stick<00:03:02.459> it<00:03:02.579> through<00:03:02.959> the<00:03:03.959> hole

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:04.199 
hand and let stick it through the hole

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:07.599 
hand and let stick it through the hole
over<00:03:04.829> for<00:03:05.099> a<00:03:05.159> second<00:03:05.519> I'll<00:03:06.120> turn<00:03:06.269> it<00:03:06.389> over<00:03:06.510> I

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:07.609 
over for a second I'll turn it over I

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.429 
over for a second I'll turn it over I
have<00:03:08.609> a<00:03:08.699> little<00:03:08.849> pair<00:03:09.120> of<00:03:09.209> hemostats<00:03:09.780> here<00:03:10.319> I'm

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:10.439 
have a little pair of hemostats here I'm

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:12.259 
have a little pair of hemostats here I'm
going<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.620> pull<00:03:10.949> that<00:03:11.280> wire<00:03:11.519> through<00:03:11.909> and<00:03:12.120> so<00:03:12.209> I

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
going to pull that wire through and so I

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.640 
going to pull that wire through and so I
can<00:03:12.389> get<00:03:12.480> a<00:03:12.510> hold<00:03:12.689> of<00:03:12.780> it<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:14.659> a<00:03:15.659> port<00:03:15.959> until<00:03:16.530> it

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
can get a hold of it and a port until it

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.020 
can get a hold of it and a port until it
goes<00:03:16.739> all<00:03:16.919> the<00:03:16.949> way<00:03:19.340> this<00:03:20.340> fits<00:03:20.609> under<00:03:20.879> that

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
goes all the way this fits under that

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.399 
goes all the way this fits under that
lip<00:03:22.189> the<00:03:23.189> one<00:03:23.459> screw<00:03:23.909> in<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.329> bag<00:03:24.540> remaining

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:25.409 
lip the one screw in the bag remaining

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:28.780 
lip the one screw in the bag remaining
goes<00:03:25.829> in<00:03:26.009> there<00:03:26.129> the<00:03:26.220> hold<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.459> wing<00:03:26.639> on<00:03:26.989> and

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
goes in there the hold the wing on and

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.020 
goes in there the hold the wing on and
then<00:03:29.790> I<00:03:30.500> just<00:03:31.500> screw<00:03:31.769> this<00:03:31.919> back<00:03:32.159> this<00:03:32.579> back

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
then I just screw this back this back

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.999 
then I just screw this back this back
piece<00:03:33.299> holds<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.930> wing<00:03:34.079> off<00:03:34.259> so<00:03:34.500> so<00:03:34.739> the<00:03:34.829> wings

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:35.009 
piece holds the wing off so so the wings

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:36.649 
piece holds the wing off so so the wings
held<00:03:35.250> off<00:03:35.400> in<00:03:35.609> several<00:03:35.819> different<00:03:36.030> ways<00:03:36.239> I

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:36.659 
held off in several different ways I

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:38.479 
held off in several different ways I
don't<00:03:37.290> even<00:03:37.379> even<00:03:37.709> have<00:03:37.859> it<00:03:37.979> screwed<00:03:38.310> onto

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
don't even even have it screwed onto

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.210 
don't even even have it screwed onto
glued<00:03:38.790> on<00:03:38.939> anything<00:03:39.150> yet<00:03:39.389> NC<00:03:39.919> it's<00:03:40.919> already

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
glued on anything yet NC it's already

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.659 
glued on anything yet NC it's already
going<00:03:41.430> to<00:03:41.519> hold<00:03:42.379> so<00:03:43.379> what<00:03:43.769> goes<00:03:44.519> together

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:44.669 
going to hold so what goes together

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:48.020 
going to hold so what goes together

wonderfully on the nose gear all I have

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.499 
wonderfully on the nose gear all I have
to<00:03:48.060> do<00:03:48.329> is<00:03:48.599> remove<00:03:49.049> this<00:03:49.639> set<00:03:50.639> screw<00:03:51.000> a<00:03:51.209> couple
