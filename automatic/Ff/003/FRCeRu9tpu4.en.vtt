00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:08.189
 what's up with people zero tv with one 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.019
 new video to destiny in front of some 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.090
 hours there was an interesting lies 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.099
 to new destiny extensions the 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.529
 website kotaku.com has its own 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.680
 details from an informant one 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.420
 get bigger destiny marketing plan 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.119
 the some about what we have so far 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.039
 have speculated and also speculated 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.109
 something new in the room, too 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.060
 Of course you have to say that it is 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.309
 there is no evidence for that here 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.780
 anything can change should be clear 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.180
 also still can not even 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.879
 So please be skeptical 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.710
 stay but this whole thing sounds very much 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.290
 plausible and coincides with the previous 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.789
 supplied information according to this 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.090
 informants should the new extension 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:51.449
 the taking mean $ 40 cost and 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.969
 to appear on 15 september this year 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.850
 Almost exactly a year after the first 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.710
 its release at 40 dollars we can 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.170
 assume that this is the big one 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.969
 extension you go with the then 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.820
 name comet has been placed 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:09.119
 according to the informant it will be new pvp 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.479
 Maps new strikes give a new raid 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.979
 and have a new opposing race so yes 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.350
 currently the drive away kabale and 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.360
 fallen and with the new extension 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.460
 there will be a fifth breed called 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.130
 that taken the fallen yes, too 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.380
 the full sounds so very consistent and 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.360
 In addition, every class becomes plausible 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.759
 get another focus because 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.860
 right now it's so great that everyone is great 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.470
 with the title walk or hunter only two 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.720
 already at that time there was yes you are 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.950
 the possible third focus but there has 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.810
 you say that quickly 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.119
 somehow never planned a third focus 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.570
 but this third slot was in 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.100
 Inventory was only meant for a kind 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.259
 Preset to save means so 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.240
 For example, if you were a hunter you would have 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.939
 twice the sound of dancers as a focus 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.079
 but can have different 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:57.060
 stored skill trees 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.950
 but that does not make sense 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.990
 one at the whole variations the 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.180
 more than one is possible 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.219
 another slot would have needed it 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.670
 This system can also use fully 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.380
 otherwise one would only have 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.750
 have to give new things when you are 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.239
 other exotic itunes, for example 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.770
 Well, yes, this system wants to use 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.420
 was yes, as you have noticed 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.190
 completely discarded and loud 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.920
 informants, it is finally the third 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.720
 Focus on the classes as well 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.330
 we can already tell you how 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.040
 the new super attacks probably 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.910
 Who would that be then for the once 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:33.190
 hunter of the teaching focus gravity to german 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.440
 so maybe gravitational bow 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:39.430
 Sounds pretty nice for somehow too 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.170
 the walk the battery focus electric storm 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.600
 So electric storm and for the 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.670
 second flaming inhibitor so maybe 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.319
 flaming hammer there is still a lot 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.670
 scope for the translation 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.530
 sometimes it just gets complete 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.239
 We have to call them different 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.519
 Just look how it will be 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.860
 There is not much news yet 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:00.790
 except that it's just about orix game 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.780
 father of trotha and wants revenge and 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.360
 has an army 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.360
 put together from just this new one 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:11.230
 breed yes and therefore also seemingly 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.700
 the name of the taken king the king of the 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.680
 you know 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.079
 Bungie has an opinion on this 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.310
 info opposite kotaku way 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.780
 declined 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.250
 and then it always shoots 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.260
 very happily comments on that 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.880
 but concerns when it comes to halt nix 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.470
 get the feet for the first time 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.450
 maybe an indication that there 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.450
 some of it is true because of some 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.670
 days has already leaked that it 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.650
 think of a red bull promo action 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.780
 we will already have it 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.980
 a video made check for it above 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.970
 right or down in the description 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.410
 the video 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.530
 You will also find in the description 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.239
 the original contribution from kotaku okay 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.590
 people you actually say city ​​to 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.780
 So we will be very interested 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.910
 because that is the future of destiny 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.560
 do you think that's gonna happen? 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.880
 Become diligent in any case 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.410
 to discuss comments with and then 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.030
 still have my little opinion 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.410
 I last red bull video too 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.109
 said and then someone has 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.269
 written that if we say that 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:05.739
 We probably will not argue with you 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:07.090
 I have to comment on that 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.130
 I have already written that 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.870
 We also commented on that 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.519
 do not always find the time directly 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.049
 to answer every comment and that is 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.710
 then sometimes it will take a day though 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:17.420
 we read how 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:19.250
 Here you can see every comment 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:21.470
 and as soon as we find the time we will 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.750
 So everything answers people as I said 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:26.600
 your thoughts in the comments 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.460
