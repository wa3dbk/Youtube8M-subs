 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:14.670

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:19.470

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:24.260
 set up so change one correctly 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:28.289
 Actually rather, you have it 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:30.990
 three dashes that are the setting there 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:37.010
 If you go then there are many other things 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:40.670
 So adjust downloads underground 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:43.129
 then here is the start of new tab 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.250
 Workers still stopped by or 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:49.240
 Open a specific page or pages 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:53.770
 here has set with us page 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:55.420
 and I have my channel side you can 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.850
 to use the current page means to 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.380
 example, that here the fans on this time 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.280

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.530
 actually 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.440
 So we can do that for example 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.360
 use current page then you go 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.140

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.880

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.300
 That's when I'm here now 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:22.320

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:22.320
 channel then went copied 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.290
 so 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.600
 and then goes from files though then 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:36.240
 saved 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:37.070
 then it is gone then so then 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.210
 adjusted 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.120

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.810
