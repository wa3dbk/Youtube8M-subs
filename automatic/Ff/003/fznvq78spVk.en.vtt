I<00:02:20.440> didn't<00:02:20.770> have<00:02:20.950> before<00:02:21.280> and<00:02:21.820> of<00:02:22.540> course<00:02:22.780> down

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
I didn't have before and of course down

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:42.839

00:02:42.849 --> 00:03:03.860 

that<00:02:43.849> was<00:02:44.000> a<00:02:44.030> c-major

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:23.260 

major<00:03:10.920> volume<00:03:13.019> tone

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.200 

this<00:03:24.270> one<00:03:24.510> I<00:03:24.540> think<00:03:24.780> controls<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:25.560> pickups

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.210 
this one I think controls the pickups

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:40.320 
this one I think controls the pickups
when<00:03:27.210> you<00:03:27.330> have<00:03:27.480> it<00:03:27.600> up<00:03:27.780> it<00:03:27.990> will<00:03:28.770> pick<00:03:28.980> up

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.590

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
I get bitter down and it's both of them

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.810 
I get bitter down and it's both of them
on<00:03:43.840> and<00:03:44.050> shouts<00:03:44.260> up<00:03:44.530> more<00:03:45.190> aggressive<00:03:45.640> that

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
on and shouts up more aggressive that

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.720 
on and shouts up more aggressive that
way<00:03:46.290> playing<00:03:47.290> medalists<00:03:47.800> that's<00:03:48.220> the<00:03:48.340> style<00:03:48.550> I

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
way playing medalists that's the style I

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.640 
way playing medalists that's the style I
like<00:03:48.910> and<00:03:49.270> the<00:03:50.080> other<00:03:50.200> thing<00:03:50.440> well<00:03:50.620> that's

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
like and the other thing well that's

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.000 
like and the other thing well that's
obvious<00:03:51.160> is<00:03:51.400> I<00:03:52.230> can<00:03:53.230> play<00:03:53.410> this<00:03:53.530> much<00:03:53.710> standing

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
obvious is I can play this much standing

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.400 
obvious is I can play this much standing
up<00:03:54.160> this<00:03:54.730> guitar<00:03:55.330> is<00:03:55.450> so<00:03:55.690> much<00:03:55.870> lighter<00:03:56.140> than

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410
