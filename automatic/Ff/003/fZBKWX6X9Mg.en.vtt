00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
of a novelty but it's not horrible let's

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.790 
of a novelty but it's not horrible let's
see<00:02:08.670> if<00:02:08.819> we<00:02:08.940> can<00:02:09.119> fire<00:02:09.479> up<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.869> video<00:02:10.170> here<00:02:10.590> what

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
see if we can fire up a video here what

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.130 
see if we can fire up a video here what
do<00:02:10.860> we<00:02:10.950> want<00:02:11.129> to<00:02:11.160> see

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
do we want to see

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:25.750 
do we want to see
coral<00:02:12.770> something<00:02:13.280> or<00:02:13.400> other<00:02:24.490> the<00:02:25.490> video

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
coral something or other the video

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.330 
coral something or other the video
itself<00:02:25.910> is<00:02:26.270> actually<00:02:26.450> pretty<00:02:26.780> smooth<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:27.980> 3ds

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
itself is actually pretty smooth the 3ds

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.760 
itself is actually pretty smooth the 3ds
it<00:02:28.490> doesn't<00:02:28.940> seem<00:02:29.090> to<00:02:29.120> affect<00:02:29.330> that<00:02:29.720> and<00:02:30.020> so

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
it doesn't seem to affect that and so

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.080 
it doesn't seem to affect that and so
the<00:02:30.920> core<00:02:31.130> right<00:02:31.400> here<00:02:31.580> is<00:02:31.640> kind<00:02:31.790> of<00:02:31.880> popping

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
the core right here is kind of popping

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.630 
the core right here is kind of popping
out<00:02:32.360> at<00:02:32.540> me<00:02:32.660> a<00:02:32.690> little<00:02:32.900> bit<00:02:33.160> so<00:02:34.160> nothing<00:02:34.490> like

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
out at me a little bit so nothing like

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.400 
out at me a little bit so nothing like
extends<00:02:35.300> from<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.510> screen<00:02:35.870> right<00:02:36.080> is<00:02:36.290> not

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
extends from the screen right is not

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.170 
extends from the screen right is not
holographic<00:02:37.100> but<00:02:37.520> you<00:02:37.610> do<00:02:37.730> get<00:02:37.880> some<00:02:38.030> good

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
holographic but you do get some good

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.880 
holographic but you do get some good
depth<00:02:38.510> in<00:02:38.720> it<00:02:38.870> and<00:02:39.080> it's<00:02:39.230> actually<00:02:39.470> pretty

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
depth in it and it's actually pretty

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.340 
depth in it and it's actually pretty
watchable<00:02:40.280> I<00:02:41.090> was<00:02:41.420> pretty<00:02:41.630> surprised<00:02:41.989> back<00:02:42.200> in

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
watchable I was pretty surprised back in

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.020 
watchable I was pretty surprised back in
Mobile<00:02:42.560> World<00:02:42.680> Congress<00:02:42.770> and<00:02:43.459> it<00:02:43.610> doesn't

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
Mobile World Congress and it doesn't

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.840 
Mobile World Congress and it doesn't
look<00:02:44.180> any<00:02:44.390> worse<00:02:44.630> today<00:02:44.959> and<00:02:45.470> as<00:02:46.100> you<00:02:46.310> know

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
look any worse today and as you know

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.580 
look any worse today and as you know
they<00:02:47.030> gives<00:02:47.239> a<00:02:47.390> really<00:02:47.690> long<00:02:48.020> technical

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
they gives a really long technical

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.060 
they gives a really long technical
explanation<00:02:49.220> for<00:02:49.459> it<00:02:49.550> tonight<00:02:50.920> and<00:02:51.920> they

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
explanation for it tonight and they

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.110 
explanation for it tonight and they
really<00:02:52.340> have<00:02:52.459> put<00:02:52.640> a<00:02:52.670> lot<00:02:52.700> of<00:02:52.850> thought<00:02:53.090> into

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
really have put a lot of thought into

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:02.740 
really have put a lot of thought into
this<00:02:53.540> so<00:02:53.959> to<00:02:54.200> see<00:02:54.410> something<00:02:55.190> with<00:02:55.459> people<00:03:01.750> so

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
this so to see something with people so

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.070 
this so to see something with people so
motion<00:03:02.930> is<00:03:03.170> not<00:03:03.350> a<00:03:03.380> problem<00:03:03.709> that's<00:03:04.519> cool

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
motion is not a problem that's cool

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.729 
motion is not a problem that's cool
let's<00:03:06.080> see<00:03:06.290> what<00:03:06.440> else<00:03:06.500> we<00:03:06.709> can<00:03:06.830> find<00:03:06.890> in<00:03:07.310> here

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
let's see what else we can find in here

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.590 
let's see what else we can find in here
see<00:03:09.739> if<00:03:09.769> we<00:03:09.890> can<00:03:09.980> get<00:03:10.040> asphalt<00:03:10.489> going<00:03:11.239> without

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
see if we can get asphalt going without

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.930 
see if we can get asphalt going without
too<00:03:11.900> much<00:03:12.050> trouble<00:03:13.180> come<00:03:14.180> on<00:03:14.360> you<00:03:15.290> can<00:03:15.440> do<00:03:15.560> it

going to take too long we will take a
deeper<00:03:29.750> deeper<00:03:29.959> look<00:03:30.170> in<00:03:30.320> the<00:03:30.380> 3d<00:03:30.680> stuff<00:03:30.860> later

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
deeper deeper look in the 3d stuff later

this is not final software so this is
developer<00:03:43.489> to<00:03:43.640> build<00:03:43.900> so<00:03:44.900> don't<00:03:45.380> be<00:03:45.470> surprised

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
developer to build so don't be surprised

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.979 
developer to build so don't be surprised
when<00:03:46.040> things<00:03:46.370> go<00:03:47.060> a<00:03:47.090> little<00:03:47.299> haywire<00:03:47.750> right

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
when things go a little haywire right

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:49.840 
when things go a little haywire right
now<00:03:48.170> so<00:03:48.739> right<00:03:48.980> now<00:03:49.010> when<00:03:49.340> you<00:03:49.430> fire<00:03:49.610> up<00:03:49.640> the

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
now so right now when you fire up the

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.699 
now so right now when you fire up the
camera<00:03:50.180> you<00:03:50.450> have<00:03:50.480> options<00:03:51.049> right<00:03:51.230> right<00:03:51.590> now

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
camera you have options right right now

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.140 
camera you have options right right now
it's<00:03:51.860> on<00:03:51.950> the<00:03:52.010> 3d<00:03:52.310> setting<00:03:52.640> wing<00:03:52.820> change<00:03:53.060> of

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
it's on the 3d setting wing change of

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.289 
it's on the 3d setting wing change of
acta<00:03:53.360> 2d<00:03:54.310> and<00:03:55.310> now<00:03:55.670> it<00:03:55.820> looks<00:03:55.850> more<00:03:56.120> like<00:03:56.269> a

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
acta 2d and now it looks more like a

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:01.300 
acta 2d and now it looks more like a
normal<00:03:56.660> camera<00:03:57.280> flip<00:03:58.280> it<00:03:58.400> back<00:04:00.310> and

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
normal camera flip it back and

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.110 
normal camera flip it back and
everything<00:04:01.730> goes<00:04:01.880> a<00:04:01.910> little

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
everything goes a little

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.940 
everything goes a little
