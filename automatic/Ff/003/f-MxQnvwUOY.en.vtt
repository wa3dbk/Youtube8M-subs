so<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.270> don't<00:01:34.079> know<00:01:34.229> about<00:01:34.350> any<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:34.770> other

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
so I don't know about any of that other

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.410 
so I don't know about any of that other
coding<00:01:35.430> but<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.670> know<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:35.939> their<00:01:36.150> smock

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
coding but I know that their smock

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.350 
coding but I know that their smock
dresses<00:01:36.810> Fran<00:01:37.560> come<00:01:37.799> up<00:01:37.950> pretty<00:01:38.220> pretty<00:01:39.119> big

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
dresses Fran come up pretty pretty big

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.080 
dresses Fran come up pretty pretty big
compared<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.320> what<00:01:40.530> they<00:01:40.650> should<00:01:40.680> do<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:42.060> I

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
compared to what they should do and so I

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.240 
compared to what they should do and so I
ended<00:01:42.450> up<00:01:42.540> getting<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:42.899> in<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.200> UK<00:01:43.619> size<00:01:43.890> 4

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
ended up getting this in the UK size 4

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.950 
ended up getting this in the UK size 4
but<00:01:44.640> quite<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.880> lot<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.180> spare<00:01:45.509> but<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:45.930> a

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
but quite a lot to spare but it is a

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.630 
but quite a lot to spare but it is a
smoke<00:01:46.320> dress<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.770> smoke<00:01:46.950> dresses<00:01:47.250> are<00:01:47.399> meant

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
smoke dress and smoke dresses are meant

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.249 
smoke dress and smoke dresses are meant
to<00:01:47.729> have<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.880> bit<00:01:48.090> of<00:01:48.180> sort<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:48.869> bagginess

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
to have a bit of sort of bagginess

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.749 
to have a bit of sort of bagginess
relaxed<00:01:49.860> look<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.430> them

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
relaxed look to them

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.249 
relaxed look to them
so<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.090> know<00:01:51.299> they<00:01:51.540> aren't<00:01:51.689> meant<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:51.960> be<00:01:52.049> kind

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
so I know they aren't meant to be kind

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.899 
so I know they aren't meant to be kind
of<00:01:52.320> baggy<00:01:52.500> but<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.070> kind<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.369> feel<00:01:53.579> like<00:01:53.610> maybe

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
of baggy but I kind of feel like maybe

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.270 
of baggy but I kind of feel like maybe
they<00:01:54.899> could<00:01:55.049> have<00:01:55.140> taken<00:01:55.500> an<00:01:55.590> inch<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.009> on<00:01:56.159> the

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
they could have taken an inch and on the

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.190 
they could have taken an inch and on the
back<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.759> just<00:01:56.939> does<00:01:57.119> up<00:01:57.299> with<00:01:57.570> these<00:01:57.810> little

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
back it just does up with these little

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.789 
back it just does up with these little

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.080 
buttons which i think is nice it's a
little<00:02:01.979> bit<00:02:02.070> different<00:02:02.369> than<00:02:02.490> using<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.909> zip

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090
