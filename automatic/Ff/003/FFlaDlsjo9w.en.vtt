00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.539
 these places all tight today we get 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.230
 found for a makeup tutorial 

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:16.299
 colored in shades of blue and brown 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.310
 for this makeup tutorial I associated 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.369
 so blue which is a tone rather 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:24.490
 cold brown to brown a bit too 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.529
 orange and that allows to warm and 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.849
 make the makeup a little more 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:29.619
 portable because it's true that 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:30.759
 many young women do not dare 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.890
 wear colors 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.570
 but when you associate colors 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.809
 with more neutral tones 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.510
 it becomes immediately much more 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.280
 notebook much more discreet I 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.479
 made this makeup with products 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.220
 beautiful green revolution 

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:47.080
 but if you do not have the same lighthouse 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.629
 that I invite you to inspire yourself 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:53.739
 colors so I used a lighthouse 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:59.260
 blue lighthouse christelle afar strand 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:01:02.460
 rougis hazelnut afar brown cocoa a 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:05.560
 lighthouse orange and called earl gray 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.409
 my favorite vanilla lighthouse which is a 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.079
 off-white that tugged a little on the yellow 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:12.960
 is also a little iridescent white makeup 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:15.429
 snow 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.020
 I start by applying a base 

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:18.789
 white all over my eyelid 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.500
 so I have not found a base yet 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:24.249
 white bio so here I apply a 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:27.060
 jumbo patil difficulty he home in nyx 

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:27.060
 milk colors 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.970
 with a small flat brush I come 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:52.530
 taken from my blue lighthouse christelle and 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.880
 I affix on the entire eyelid 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.820
 I stay focused on the eyelid 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.560
 mobile and I do not hesitate to henry 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.270
 apply several times in a row to 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.270
 well intensify the color 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.800
 then with a small end brush 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.810
 late I come to take my lighthouse hazelnut 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.850
 I will pause is in the palm of my 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:29.910
 eyelid so really I will stay 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:31.350
 just have to mount blue for now 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.530
 I do not go back at all my makeup 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:37.310
 I stay focused just certainly on 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.310
 this area here 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.250
 then I come dimmed with a brush 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:57.280
 fades their own milk butter from my 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:59.500
 lighthouse I will resume again from 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.390
 my lighthouse hazelnut with this time a 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.550
 mulled wine with a bit more 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.640
 is a little more specific and I will come 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:16.810
 apply it in the wide hollow 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:18.370
 I do not go back to the eyebrows 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.709
 just took the fahva nor with a 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.720
 brush and stomper clean and I'm going to 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:26.549
 pause and under the eyebrow what will me 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.549
 also allow to degrade my pharma 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:38.739
 I also come corner meters 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:42.360
 internal of the eye possibly on 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.360
 this area there to fade makeup 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.950
 I then take a lighthouse a little more 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.540
 bran called cocoa a very small 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.790
 a little darker on a small brush 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.190
 accuracy and I'm going to come intensify 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.519
 so my hollow so for the end pr and the 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.670
 rat of my upper eyelashes corner 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:05.319
 external 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:07.269
 I apply it in the hollow end for 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:11.079
 intensify it give more dimension 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:15.989
 to makeup and I come back to gold to 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:15.989
 home always in outer corner 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.669
 then I come they are and the hole 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.640
 I take this opportunity to make my style 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:47.390
 lower with always cocoa farr 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:50.500
 I'm going to put a small amount on 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.500
 the external part 

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:59.379
 to warm up a little bit 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:03.009
 makeup I just take a little bit of 

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:05.619
 earl earl gray earl gray pardon it's 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:08.529
 a lighthouse matt slightly orange in 

00:05:05.619 --> 00:05:15.639
 orange and even and I will come the break 

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:16.959
 and at that level, then it seems 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:21.549
 very intense but then I'm going to 

00:05:16.959 --> 00:05:24.999
 melt and I'm going back 

00:05:21.549 --> 00:05:29.199
 so far so orange is a 

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:30.909
 complementary color of blue so 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:33.809
 do not be afraid of the result after that 

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:33.809
 will make a nice harmony 

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:40.089
 I'm going to apply that same lighthouse flush 

00:05:38.679 --> 00:05:40.599
 lower lashes but we will 

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:42.509
 apply 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:44.559
 this time rather towards the middle 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:46.299
 to the inner edge 

00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:48.309
 of course we did not stay with this 

00:05:46.299 --> 00:05:50.739
 demarcation so we'll take a little bit of 

00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:58.809

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.820
 that your blush has lost two years of 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.820
 intensity 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:35.210
