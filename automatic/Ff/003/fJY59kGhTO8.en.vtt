if it doesn't read anything videos
beginning<00:01:02.940> as<00:01:03.270> dress<00:01:04.100> it's<00:01:05.100> also<00:01:05.250> very<00:01:05.549> fast

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:24.620 

it<00:01:09.600> still<00:01:09.810> has<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:09.990> good<00:01:10.140> range

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
the scanner comes in an industrialized

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.950 
the scanner comes in an industrialized
version<00:01:27.450> as<00:01:27.689> well<00:01:27.720> as<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.740> LS<00:01:29.130> 3008<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.689> has

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
version as well as the LS 3008 it has

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.930 
version as well as the LS 3008 it has
the<00:01:31.080> same<00:01:31.200> scanning<00:01:31.650> ability<00:01:31.770> as<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.400> LS<00:01:32.729> for

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
the same scanning ability as the LS for

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.740 
the same scanning ability as the LS for
208<00:01:33.290> and<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.950> comes<00:01:35.130> in<00:01:35.250> yellow<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.750> the

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
208 and it comes in yellow and the

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.380 
208 and it comes in yellow and the
difference<00:01:37.110> is<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.530> has<00:01:37.560> an<00:01:37.860> IP<00:01:38.100> 54<00:01:38.759> seal

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
difference is that it has an IP 54 seal

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.620 
difference is that it has an IP 54 seal
which<00:01:39.899> allows<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.470> be<00:01:40.680> used<00:01:40.920> in<00:01:41.299> dirty<00:01:42.299> and

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
which allows to be used in dirty and

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.950 
which allows to be used in dirty and
dusty<00:01:42.840> environments<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.369> can<00:01:44.490> get<00:01:44.610> wet

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
dusty environments and it can get wet

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.539 
dusty environments and it can get wet
which<00:01:45.960> makes<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.590> easy<00:01:47.580> to<00:01:47.940> sanitize<00:01:48.890> it<00:01:49.890> it's
