00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:16.610
 on the road in the automobile luxury 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.610
 class mathis korac tests the jaguar xj 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.450
 However, the l does not stand for luxury 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.310
 but that's what the extra l stands for 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.320
 stands for long version and that is 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.090
 about twelve inches longer than that 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:34.940
 not really short anyway 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:37.160
 normal version of the jaguar xk of the jaguar 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.570
 xj l will be in germany with nine 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.390
 motor variants offered 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.100
 a three-liter v6 diesel 1 3 liter v6 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.140
 petrol and a five liters 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.360
 gasoline engine with eight cylinders 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.510
 We test the three liter petrol engine 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.060
 with 250 kilowatts of power from the 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.070
 manufacturer specified consumption with 9 6 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.570
 liters of fuel is at 100 kilometers 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.940
 very difficult to reach 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.980
 the weight of the jaguar paired with the 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.739
 Demand strong engine power 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.160
 her tribute and cupping tank and 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.160
 purse 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.000
 if you think of jaguar, you think 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.960
 maybe on sports car icon like the e 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.360
 type really sporty, the ex is not 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.070
 With a weight of 18 tons you can 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.070
 But he can certainly see that 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.860
 So if the British can do it then 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.619
 is the interior design it sees everything 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.750
 very high quality from very harmonious that is 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.390
 but nothing overdone or overcharged 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.340
 So good from just a small note 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.380
 I would have been here on the front 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.080
 dashboard where the airbag in case of emergency 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.939
 comes out is such an ugly seam that 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.890
 I suppose you would have solved it differently 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.399
 can so far to the interior design 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.679
 later more 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.259
 the body is like no other 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:03.720
 expect the neatly processed that 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.619
 design is refreshingly modern sporty 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.619
 He comes elegantly 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.709
 in the long version of the xj the grows 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.780
 turning circle from 11 9 to 12 3 meters in 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.700
 The city and in car parks can do that too 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.680
 cause cumbersome turning maneuvers 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:34.900
 in the fond of the luxury sedan can 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:37.040
 the passengers in each case feel comfortable 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.180
 leather seats and plenty legroom 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.180
 speak for themselves 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.050
 at the touch of a button can even be at the 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.450
 rear window extend a sun visor 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.739
 And there is also an extra sunroof 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.739
 for the rear dominions 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.819
 there act the manually operated 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.890
 The side windows are almost blinding 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.780
 backward off instead of a monitor with 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.909
 tv reception are hidden behind 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.709
 this flip loose mirror 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:14.709
 but at least with lighting 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.180
 my absolute highlight on the 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.430
 The price list is the dual view display 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.110
 for the infotainment system as you see 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.150
 See a map now when I am 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.040
 press this button here opens 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.440
 a small window and when I leave that 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.090
 clique you suddenly see a video me 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.520
 personally, however, continue to see the 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.810
 map so can the driver 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.960
 continue on the traffic 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:43.210
 Focus while the passenger turns 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:44.980
 from a screen can not be entertained 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.440
 so unusual but still with 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.570
 to look at are the many piano lacquer 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.790
 Applications on the dashboard and 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.220
 loving details for the analogue clock 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.700
 the cockpit its classic flair 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.700
 to lend 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:09.390
 more and more automakers about it 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.400
 to install fully digital combination instruments 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.680
 Of course that has the advantage that you 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.150
 much more flexible in the design 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.340
 and also in the display of various 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.769
 Data, however, has it in mine 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.710
 eyes the disadvantage that the display 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.780
 not one hundred percent liquid though 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.310
 I accelerate fast now and the 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.750
 speed goes up quickly then 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.240
 you see again jerks and pointers 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:34.640
 the other way down, of course 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:38.550
 just as special from the general to the general 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:41.730
 the conclusion with a complete price of 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:44.180
 well over 100,000 euros as well as this 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:46.740
 car here is the jaguar xjc 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.450
 Of course, not quite a cheap pleasure 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.520
 but if you look at the competitive environment 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:51.330
 look at stuttgart munich or 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.940
 ingolstadt 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.830
 they are not cheaper, either 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.390
 not much more expensive and if you are 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.430
 a car is looking for the man from the 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:02.400
 then stand out a bit 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.700
 is the excel maybe the right one 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.700
 alternative
