00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.650 
underbelly of the city was located in
that<00:02:17.440> area<00:02:17.500> immediately<00:02:18.400> around<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:19.150> Cecil

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
that area immediately around the Cecil

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.600 
that area immediately around the Cecil
and<00:02:19.840> so<00:02:20.019> I<00:02:20.049> think<00:02:20.410> he<00:02:20.560> really<00:02:21.010> felt<00:02:21.280> at<00:02:21.459> home

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
and so I think he really felt at home

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.570 
and so I think he really felt at home
there<00:02:22.860> if<00:02:23.860> he<00:02:24.069> had<00:02:24.250> a<00:02:24.280> little<00:02:24.670> bit<00:02:24.880> by<00:02:25.810> himself

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
there if he had a little bit by himself

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.789 
there if he had a little bit by himself
he<00:02:27.580> lay<00:02:27.790> he<00:02:28.360> tried<00:02:28.660> to<00:02:29.220> set<00:02:30.220> you<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.459> pressure

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
he lay he tried to set you the pressure

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.069 
he lay he tried to set you the pressure
there<00:02:32.799> was<00:02:32.980> a<00:02:33.489> lot<00:02:33.760> of<00:02:33.790> violence<00:02:34.090> inside<00:02:34.810> him

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:35.079 
there was a lot of violence inside him

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:37.030 
there was a lot of violence inside him
otherwise<00:02:35.860> he<00:02:36.040> would<00:02:36.370> have

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
otherwise he would have

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.690 
otherwise he would have
so<00:02:37.219> many<00:02:38.000> people<00:02:38.629> it<00:02:39.590> was<00:02:39.650> easier<00:02:40.099> for<00:02:40.219> him<00:02:40.519> too

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
so many people it was easier for him too
