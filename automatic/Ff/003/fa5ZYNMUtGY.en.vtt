00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.350 
there
you<00:02:27.050> know<00:02:27.170> it's<00:02:27.349> minor<00:02:27.769> defects<00:02:28.280> but<00:02:28.730> uh<00:02:28.790> it's

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
you know it's minor defects but uh it's

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.839 
you know it's minor defects but uh it's
the<00:02:29.450> overall<00:02:29.810> I<00:02:30.220> still<00:02:31.220> think<00:02:31.430> that<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:31.640> the

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
the overall I still think that the the

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.710 
the overall I still think that the the
vectors<00:02:32.150> that<00:02:32.269> came<00:02:32.480> out<00:02:32.660> in<00:02:33.849> 2003<00:02:34.849> are<00:02:35.330> better

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
vectors that came out in 2003 are better

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.600 
vectors that came out in 2003 are better
than<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:36.140> original<00:02:36.470> of<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.590> command<00:02:36.920> in<00:02:37.190> 2000

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
than the original of the command in 2000

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.160 
than the original of the command in 2000
I'm<00:02:37.849> sorry<00:02:38.150> in<00:02:38.269> uh<00:02:38.300> in<00:02:38.890> 97<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.690> defects

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
I'm sorry in uh in 97 the the defects

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.330 
I'm sorry in uh in 97 the the defects
that<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:43.549> originals<00:02:44.030> had<00:02:44.239> and<00:02:45.190> also<00:02:46.190> because

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
that the originals had and also because

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.280 
that the originals had and also because
of<00:02:46.370> the<00:02:46.459> weight<00:02:46.700> you<00:02:46.970> know<00:02:47.599> that<00:02:47.720> they<00:02:47.840> say<00:02:48.019> on

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
of the weight you know that they say on

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.860 
of the weight you know that they say on
the<00:02:48.379> retros<00:02:48.769> they<00:02:48.980> actually<00:02:49.220> managed<00:02:49.489> to<00:02:49.870> make

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
the retros they actually managed to make

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.809 
the retros they actually managed to make
a<00:02:51.110> shoe<00:02:51.410> a<00:02:51.440> lot<00:02:51.620> lighter<00:02:51.830> than<00:02:52.129> the<00:02:52.370> originals

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
a shoe a lot lighter than the originals

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.070 
a shoe a lot lighter than the originals
you<00:02:53.269> know<00:02:53.360> they<00:02:53.480> probably<00:02:53.569> change<00:02:53.959> the

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
you know they probably change the

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.050 
you know they probably change the
material<00:02:54.590> I<00:02:54.830> believe<00:02:55.190> that<00:02:55.340> they<00:02:55.459> change<00:02:55.790> the

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
material I believe that they change the

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.289 
material I believe that they change the
air<00:02:56.360> so<00:02:56.690> unit<00:02:57.110> also<00:02:57.950> these<00:02:58.340> lace<00:02:58.670> tips<00:02:58.970> on<00:02:59.209> the

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
air so unit also these lace tips on the

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:00.509 
air so unit also these lace tips on the
originals<00:02:59.660> the<00:02:59.690> mid<00:02:59.840> out<00:02:59.930> of<00:03:00.019> metal

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
originals the mid out of metal

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.210 
originals the mid out of metal
probably<00:03:01.519> a<00:03:01.549> loom<00:03:01.730> aluminum<00:03:02.390> and<00:03:02.650> on<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:03.860> the

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
probably a loom aluminum and on the the

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.890 
probably a loom aluminum and on the the
retros<00:03:04.670> are<00:03:04.880> actually<00:03:05.120> made<00:03:05.239> out<00:03:05.299> of<00:03:05.420> plastic

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
retros are actually made out of plastic

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.710 
retros are actually made out of plastic
but<00:03:06.739> I<00:03:06.799> mean<00:03:07.040> it's<00:03:07.130> really<00:03:07.310> hard<00:03:07.430> to<00:03:07.640> tell<00:03:07.819> as

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
but I mean it's really hard to tell as

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.809 
but I mean it's really hard to tell as
far<00:03:09.079> as<00:03:09.230> like<00:03:09.410> durability<00:03:10.099> and<00:03:10.459> stuff<00:03:10.730> like

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
far as like durability and stuff like

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:11.319 
far as like durability and stuff like
that

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
that

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:15.220 
that
no<00:03:11.860> hardly<00:03:12.860> noticeable<00:03:13.340> on<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:14.060> leather<00:03:14.269> you

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
no hardly noticeable on the leather you

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.089 
no hardly noticeable on the leather you
know<00:03:15.290> compared<00:03:15.680> to<00:03:15.739> the<00:03:15.860> retros<00:03:16.250> I<00:03:16.579> think<00:03:17.540> is

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
know compared to the retros I think is

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:21.729 
know compared to the retros I think is
just<00:03:19.099> as<00:03:19.190> good<00:03:19.370> if<00:03:19.489> not<00:03:19.519> better<00:03:20.079> on<00:03:21.079> the<00:03:21.349> retros

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
just as good if not better on the retros

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.789 
just as good if not better on the retros
no<00:03:21.980> tumbled<00:03:22.489> leather<00:03:22.519> it's<00:03:23.510> not<00:03:23.720> like<00:03:24.049> you

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
no tumbled leather it's not like you

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:27.970 
no tumbled leather it's not like you
know<00:03:24.890> thin<00:03:25.220> or<00:03:25.340> anything<00:03:25.640> it's<00:03:26.560> you<00:03:27.560> know<00:03:27.650> just

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
know thin or anything it's you know just

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.190 
know thin or anything it's you know just
right<00:03:28.190> cut<00:03:28.700> you<00:03:29.450> know<00:03:29.540> again<00:03:29.780> in<00:03:29.959> my<00:03:30.079> opinion

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
right cut you know again in my opinion

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.390 
right cut you know again in my opinion
is<00:03:30.560> a<00:03:30.590> lot<00:03:30.799> better<00:03:30.950> on<00:03:31.310> the<00:03:31.700> retros<00:03:33.190> so<00:03:34.190> again

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
is a lot better on the retros so again

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.360 
is a lot better on the retros so again
these<00:03:34.850> are<00:03:34.910> the<00:03:35.030> wagon<00:03:35.299> Reds<00:03:36.280> but<00:03:37.280> I<00:03:37.310> have<00:03:37.579> and

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
these are the wagon Reds but I have and

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.129 
these are the wagon Reds but I have and
he's<00:03:40.370> a<00:03:40.400> mother<00:03:40.670> pair<00:03:40.940> of<00:03:41.030> original<00:03:41.450> I<00:03:41.750> think

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:42.139 
he's a mother pair of original I think

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:45.339 
he's a mother pair of original I think
these<00:03:42.560> actually<00:03:43.099> are<00:03:43.220> coming<00:03:43.519> out<00:03:44.170> next<00:03:45.170> month

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:45.349 
these actually are coming out next month

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:46.390 
these actually are coming out next month
or<00:03:45.739> in<00:03:45.799> a<00:03:45.829> couple<00:03:46.069> months

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
or in a couple months

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.400 
or in a couple months
they're<00:03:46.609> being<00:03:46.819> Redford<00:03:47.150> again<00:03:47.389> again<00:03:48.260> these

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
they're being Redford again again these

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.259 
they're being Redford again again these
retro<00:03:48.769> I<00:03:49.040> mean<00:03:49.220> these<00:03:49.370> are<00:03:49.549> originals<00:03:50.060> came

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
retro I mean these are originals came

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:55.059 
retro I mean these are originals came
out<00:03:50.450> in<00:03:50.920> 97<00:03:51.920> I<00:03:52.130> believe<00:03:52.370> I<00:03:53.049> have<00:03:54.049> a<00:03:54.620> few<00:03:54.920> pairs

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069 
out in 97 I believe I have a few pairs

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.720 
out in 97 I believe I have a few pairs
of<00:03:55.220> retros<00:03:55.549> I<00:03:55.760> got<00:03:56.030> these<00:03:56.269> own<00:03:57.430> these<00:03:58.430> black

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
of retros I got these own these black

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.390 
of retros I got these own these black
ones<00:03:58.970> here<00:03:59.359> these<00:03:59.930> actually<00:04:00.440> I<00:04:00.709> wear<00:04:01.160> a<00:04:01.190> lot

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
ones here these actually I wear a lot

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.530 
ones here these actually I wear a lot
these<00:04:01.639> are<00:04:01.760> pretty<00:04:02.680> frigging<00:04:03.680> worn<00:04:03.919> out<00:04:04.540> these

these are pretty frigging worn out these

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.050 
these are pretty frigging worn out these
came<00:04:05.780> on<00:04:05.930> a<00:04:06.049> package<00:04:06.560> in<00:04:06.859> 2003<00:04:07.579> with<00:04:07.760> a<00:04:07.790> hoodie

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
came on a package in 2003 with a hoodie

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.180 
came on a package in 2003 with a hoodie
and<00:04:08.209> a<00:04:08.269> half<00:04:08.480> there<00:04:09.079> were<00:04:09.290> a<00:04:09.530> time<00:04:09.829> they<00:04:10.099> were

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
and a half there were a time they were

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.190 
and a half there were a time they were
pretty<00:04:10.430> limited<00:04:11.120> than<00:04:11.780> they<00:04:11.870> were<00:04:11.989> chilled

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
pretty limited than they were chilled

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.199 
pretty limited than they were chilled
again<00:04:12.440> I<00:04:12.470> think<00:04:12.590> in<00:04:12.799> 2008<00:04:13.250> but<00:04:13.790> also<00:04:13.970> out<00:04:14.239> here

famous<00:04:24.949> scheme<00:04:25.340> that<00:04:25.520> might<00:04:25.639> be<00:04:25.729> Joyner

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
famous scheme that might be Joyner

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.560 
famous scheme that might be Joyner
played<00:04:26.180> with<00:04:26.930> the<00:04:27.020> flu<00:04:27.580> in<00:04:28.580> the<00:04:29.680> 97<00:04:30.680> playoffs<00:04:31.160> I

played with the flu in the 97 playoffs I

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.790 
played with the flu in the 97 playoffs I
think<00:04:32.570> you<00:04:32.780> know<00:04:32.870> this<00:04:33.229> came<00:04:33.500> out

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
think you know this came out

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.760 
think you know this came out
2003<00:04:34.280> I<00:04:34.310> think<00:04:34.460> the<00:04:34.759> quality<00:04:35.180> and<00:04:35.300> these<00:04:35.770> you

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
2003 I think the quality and these you

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.100 
2003 I think the quality and these you
know<00:04:36.830> overall<00:04:37.759> shoe<00:04:38.180> is<00:04:38.479> actually<00:04:38.720> better

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
know overall shoe is actually better

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.930 
know overall shoe is actually better
than<00:04:39.650> the<00:04:39.710> originals<00:04:40.190> and<00:04:40.280> that's<00:04:40.430> very<00:04:40.699> rare

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
than the originals and that's very rare

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.249 
than the originals and that's very rare
because<00:04:42.250> 99%<00:04:43.250> of<00:04:43.430> the<00:04:43.520> time<00:04:43.729> the<00:04:44.259> originals

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:45.259 
because 99% of the time the originals

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:46.810 
because 99% of the time the originals
are<00:04:45.350> always<00:04:45.590> better<00:04:45.740> than<00:04:45.860> the<00:04:45.979> rich<00:04:46.250> than<00:04:46.610> the

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
are always better than the rich than the

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.469 
are always better than the rich than the
the<00:04:47.150> retros<00:04:48.070> but<00:04:49.070> uh<00:04:49.100> not<00:04:49.699> in<00:04:49.880> this<00:04:49.970> case<00:04:50.180> I

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 
the retros but uh not in this case I

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:52.960
