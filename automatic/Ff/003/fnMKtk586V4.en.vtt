well I think what the bottom line here

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.449 
well I think what the bottom line here
is<00:01:26.610> is<00:01:27.179> that<00:01:27.800> insecure<00:01:28.800> man<00:01:29.399> will<00:01:30.240> not<00:01:30.450> be<00:01:31.459> very

00:01:32.449 --> 00:01:32.459 
is is that insecure man will not be very

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:34.010 
is is that insecure man will not be very
good<00:01:32.729> around<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.209> woman<00:01:33.539> who's<00:01:33.750> more

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
know successful and uninteresting

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.130 
know successful and uninteresting
because<00:02:08.130> they<00:02:08.310> have<00:02:08.459> an<00:02:08.580> masculine<00:02:09.360> side<00:02:09.929> of

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
because they have an masculine side of

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.320 
because they have an masculine side of
them<00:02:10.319> that's<00:02:10.530> created<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.340> success<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:12.030> I

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
them that's created the success and I

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.930 
them that's created the success and I
think<00:02:12.660> sometimes<00:02:12.989> for<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.560> men<00:02:14.130> as<00:02:14.310> well<00:02:14.550> that

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
think sometimes for the men as well that

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.210 
think sometimes for the men as well that
there<00:02:15.209> are<00:02:15.390> women<00:02:16.230> will<00:02:16.530> do<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.800> same<00:02:16.950> thing

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
there are women will do the same thing

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.860 
there are women will do the same thing
but<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:17.459> think<00:02:17.520> it's<00:02:17.849> more<00:02:18.060> so<00:02:18.120> with<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.660> guys

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
but I think it's more so with the guys

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.679 
but I think it's more so with the guys
that<00:02:19.530> they<00:02:19.830> really<00:02:20.099> do<00:02:20.310> go<00:02:20.519> for<00:02:20.879> that<00:02:21.090> that

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:21.689 
that they really do go for that that

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:23.820 
that they really do go for that that
beautiful<00:02:22.379> obvious<00:02:22.920> type
