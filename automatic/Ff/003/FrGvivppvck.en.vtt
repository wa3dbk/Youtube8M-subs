00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.560 
I really like his purple and white paint
job<00:00:36.329> along<00:00:36.870> with<00:00:36.930> his<00:00:37.290> neon<00:00:37.770> green<00:00:38.160> wheels<00:00:38.579> so

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570

transforms

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.760 

to<00:01:06.970> transform<00:01:07.540> them<00:01:07.780> you<00:01:07.990> will<00:01:08.110> just<00:01:08.350> use<00:01:08.530> his

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
to transform them you will just use his

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.950 
to transform them you will just use his
rear<00:01:09.040> spoiler<00:01:09.580> to<00:01:09.610> push<00:01:10.000> back<00:01:10.240> or<00:01:10.540> pull

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960
