from<00:00:11.210> riding<00:00:11.450> a<00:00:11.600> bike<00:00:11.780> for<00:00:11.930> the<00:00:11.960> first<00:00:12.020> time

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:12.830 
from riding a bike for the first time

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.680 
from riding a bike for the first time
so<00:00:13.160> now<00:00:13.280> you're<00:00:13.430> riding<00:00:13.730> along<00:00:13.760> and<00:00:14.150> you're<00:00:14.480> in

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
so now you're riding along and you're in

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.170 
so now you're riding along and you're in
first<00:00:14.900> gear<00:00:15.170> don't<00:00:15.500> have<00:00:15.680> that<00:00:16.250> up<00:00:16.490> or

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:17.180 
first gear don't have that up or

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.720 
first gear don't have that up or
down<00:00:17.360> the<00:00:17.480> gear<00:00:17.660> now<00:00:18.040> and<00:00:19.040> you've<00:00:19.520> already

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
down the gear now and you've already

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.130 
down the gear now and you've already
done<00:00:19.850> the<00:00:19.910> hardest<00:00:20.210> part<00:00:20.420> which<00:00:20.720> is<00:00:20.750> getting

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
done the hardest part which is getting

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.420 
done the hardest part which is getting
the<00:00:21.200> bike<00:00:21.349> off<00:00:21.500> the<00:00:21.560> mark<00:00:21.890> without<00:00:22.160> stalling

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430 
the bike off the mark without stalling

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.150 
the bike off the mark without stalling
it<00:00:22.869> so<00:00:23.869> the<00:00:23.960> rest<00:00:24.110> should<00:00:24.200> be<00:00:24.349> pretty<00:00:24.590> easy<00:00:24.740> for

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
it so the rest should be pretty easy for

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.880 
it so the rest should be pretty easy for
you<00:00:25.340> now<00:00:25.550> and<00:00:26.450> quite<00:00:27.110> simply<00:00:27.529> you<00:00:27.560> do<00:00:27.740> exactly

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
you now and quite simply you do exactly

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.849 
you now and quite simply you do exactly
the<00:00:28.250> same<00:00:28.279> thing<00:00:28.430> as<00:00:29.180> you<00:00:30.170> do<00:00:30.320> when<00:00:30.650> getting

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
the same thing as you do when getting

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:32.560 
the same thing as you do when getting
off<00:00:31.100> the<00:00:31.250> mark<00:00:31.460> but<00:00:31.640> because<00:00:32.150> you're<00:00:32.449> already

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
off the mark but because you're already

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.090 
off the mark but because you're already
moving<00:00:32.780> it's<00:00:33.680> easier<00:00:34.040> to<00:00:34.190> do<00:00:34.340> and<00:00:35.860> again<00:00:36.860> I

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
moving it's easier to do and again I

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.119 
moving it's easier to do and again I

three three four and how you look at it
key<00:00:43.070> things<00:00:43.370> that<00:00:43.519> you<00:00:43.610> need<00:00:43.730> to<00:00:43.879> remember<00:00:43.910> how

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
key things that you need to remember how

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.390 
key things that you need to remember how
to<00:00:44.480> do<00:00:44.860> first<00:00:45.860> one<00:00:46.100> is<00:00:46.309> pull<00:00:47.239> the<00:00:47.479> clutch<00:00:47.720> in

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:48.400 
to do first one is pull the clutch in

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.329 
to do first one is pull the clutch in
number<00:00:49.400> two<00:00:49.580> shift<00:00:50.360> either<00:00:50.570> up<00:00:51.080> or<00:00:51.409> down<00:00:51.470> with

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:52.339 
number two shift either up or down with

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:55.210 
number two shift either up or down with
your<00:00:52.460> left<00:00:52.670> left<00:00:53.449> leg<00:00:53.720> on<00:00:54.049> the<00:00:54.530> gear<00:00:54.739> shifter

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
your left left leg on the gear shifter

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.630 
your left left leg on the gear shifter
and<00:00:56.019> then<00:00:57.019> number<00:00:57.229> three<00:00:57.619> as<00:00:57.890> you're

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
and then number three as you're

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.890 
and then number three as you're
releasing<00:00:58.940> the<00:00:59.239> clutch<00:00:59.479> out<00:01:00.430> back<00:01:01.430> out<00:01:01.900> give

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:02.900 
releasing the clutch out back out give

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.780 
releasing the clutch out back out give
it<00:01:03.019> a<00:01:03.170> little<00:01:03.320> bit<00:01:03.619> of<00:01:03.920> acceleration<00:01:04.670> and

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
it a little bit of acceleration and

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.460 
it a little bit of acceleration and
throttle<00:01:05.180> to<00:01:05.330> bring<00:01:05.510> the<00:01:05.630> revs<00:01:05.810> back<00:01:06.049> up<00:01:06.260> and

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
throttle to bring the revs back up and

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.090 
throttle to bring the revs back up and
match<00:01:06.680> and<00:01:07.720> that<00:01:08.720> is<00:01:09.049> it<00:01:09.229> that<00:01:09.710> really<00:01:09.950> is<00:01:10.070> a

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
match and that is it that really is a

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.350 
match and that is it that really is a
old<00:01:11.619> do<00:01:12.619> that<00:01:12.799> for<00:01:13.070> you<00:01:13.189> now

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
old do that for you now

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
as we're coming up to around about you

as we're coming up to around about you
can<00:01:16.280> see<00:01:16.430> reduce<00:01:16.970> your<00:01:17.150> speed<00:01:17.620> so<00:01:18.620> I'm<00:01:18.680> going

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
can see reduce your speed so I'm going

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.530 
can see reduce your speed so I'm going
to<00:01:18.920> do<00:01:19.040> that<00:01:19.220> and<00:01:19.460> I'm<00:01:19.730> going<00:01:19.880> to<00:01:19.940> pull<00:01:20.330> in<00:01:20.420> my

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540

to do that and I'm going to pull in my
clutch<00:01:20.780> and<00:01:21.080> shift<00:01:22.070> down<00:01:22.370> and<00:01:22.670> then<00:01:22.910> let<00:01:23.120> out

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
clutch and shift down and then let out

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.600 
clutch and shift down and then let out
the<00:01:23.630> giver<00:01:24.290> Russell<00:01:24.920> again<00:01:25.070> as<00:01:25.250> I<00:01:25.340> that<00:01:25.490> out

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
the giver Russell again as I that out

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.450 
the giver Russell again as I that out
the<00:01:25.730> clutch<00:01:25.940> ready<00:01:26.720> so<00:01:27.080> clutch<00:01:27.500> in<00:01:27.740> shift<00:01:28.250> down

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
the clutch ready so clutch in shift down

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.070 
the clutch ready so clutch in shift down
and<00:01:28.700> letting<00:01:29.360> out<00:01:29.540> the<00:01:29.630> clutch<00:01:29.840> and

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
and letting out the clutch and

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.610 
and letting out the clutch and
acceleration<00:01:30.890> and<00:01:31.670> that's<00:01:31.880> it<00:01:32.350> and<00:01:33.350> you<00:01:33.470> can

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
acceleration and that's it and you can

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.090 
acceleration and that's it and you can
do<00:01:33.770> that<00:01:34.540> you<00:01:35.540> do<00:01:35.720> that<00:01:35.750> repeatedly<00:01:36.050> until<00:01:36.950> you

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
do that you do that repeatedly until you

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.550 
do that you do that repeatedly until you
get<00:01:37.250> down<00:01:37.430> back<00:01:37.729> to<00:01:37.880> first<00:01:38.150> or<00:01:38.540> why<00:01:39.229> we<00:01:39.380> gear

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
get down back to first or why we gear

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.990 
get down back to first or why we gear
you<00:01:39.650> want<00:01:39.740> to<00:01:39.830> be<00:01:39.920> in<00:01:40.010> store<00:01:40.220> it<00:01:40.310> again<00:01:40.520> cuts<00:01:40.820> in

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
you want to be in store it again cuts in

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.840 
you want to be in store it again cuts in
shift<00:01:41.270> down<00:01:41.450> and<00:01:41.660> release<00:01:42.670> and<00:01:43.670> you<00:01:43.790> obviously

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
shift down and release and you obviously

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.940 
shift down and release and you obviously
get<00:01:44.210> quicker<00:01:44.479> at<00:01:44.630> doing<00:01:44.870> this<00:01:45.020> as<00:01:45.290> you<00:01:45.710> get<00:01:45.830> to

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
get quicker at doing this as you get to

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.040 
get quicker at doing this as you get to
know<00:01:45.979> the<00:01:46.160> bike

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.140 

so<00:01:50.650> that's<00:01:50.830> shifting<00:01:51.280> around<00:01:51.370> I<00:01:51.730> wanted<00:01:52.090> to

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
so that's shifting around I wanted to

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.840 
so that's shifting around I wanted to
shift<00:01:52.300> up<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:54.100> have<00:01:54.190> to<00:01:54.310> make<00:01:54.460> sure<00:01:54.490> that<00:01:54.760> you

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
shift up you have to make sure that you

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.300 
shift up you have to make sure that you
have<00:01:54.970> sufficient<00:01:55.510> revs<00:01:56.050> so<00:01:56.830> you<00:01:56.890> can<00:01:57.130> actually

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
have sufficient revs so you can actually

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.850 
have sufficient revs so you can actually
shift<00:01:57.550> up<00:01:57.790> easily<00:01:58.440> so<00:01:59.440> as<00:01:59.530> I'm<00:01:59.680> doing<00:01:59.860> now<00:01:59.980> oh

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
shift up easily so as I'm doing now oh

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:13.570 
shift up easily so as I'm doing now oh
hang<00:02:02.860> on<00:02:02.980> till<00:02:03.220> you<00:02:03.280> get<00:02:03.340> round<00:02:03.550> this<00:02:03.610> corner

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.630 

but<00:02:14.150> just<00:02:14.600> slow<00:02:14.780> down<00:02:14.810> certain<00:02:15.410> depth

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.090 

right<00:02:19.240> so<00:02:19.540> ready<00:02:19.780> to<00:02:19.960> upset<00:02:20.350> you<00:02:20.860> need<00:02:21.010> to

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
right so ready to upset you need to

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.830 
right so ready to upset you need to
accelerate<00:02:21.490> a<00:02:21.850> bit<00:02:22.590> you<00:02:23.590> already<00:02:23.740> cut<00:02:24.670> in<00:02:24.970> kick

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
accelerate a bit you already cut in kick

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.410 
accelerate a bit you already cut in kick
up<00:02:26.050> and<00:02:26.230> release<00:02:26.890> again

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.630 

I<00:02:30.480> remember<00:02:31.380> as<00:02:31.530> you're<00:02:32.040> letting<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.430> clutch

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
I remember as you're letting the clutch

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.940 
I remember as you're letting the clutch
go<00:02:33.060> back<00:02:33.270> out<00:02:33.480> again<00:02:33.660> you<00:02:34.110> need<00:02:34.260> to<00:02:34.380> roll<00:02:34.650> on<00:02:34.920> a

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
go back out again you need to roll on a

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.370 
go back out again you need to roll on a
bit<00:02:35.190> of<00:02:35.280> throttle<00:02:35.660> not<00:02:36.660> too<00:02:36.870> much<00:02:37.050> but

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
bit of throttle not too much but

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.350 
bit of throttle not too much but
smoothly<00:02:37.709> try<00:02:38.130> ideally<00:02:38.880> you<00:02:39.000> want<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.209> make

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
smoothly try ideally you want to make

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.170 
smoothly try ideally you want to make
you<00:02:40.200> want<00:02:40.349> to<00:02:40.380> make<00:02:40.500> it<00:02:40.650> a<00:02:40.680> smooth<00:02:41.550> process<00:02:41.760> and

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
you want to make it a smooth process and

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.000 
you want to make it a smooth process and
it<00:02:42.270> will<00:02:42.420> be<00:02:42.569> smooth<00:02:42.870> in<00:02:43.170> no<00:02:43.319> time<00:02:43.560> when<00:02:43.920> you

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
it will be smooth in no time when you

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.100 
it will be smooth in no time when you
get<00:02:44.130> used<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.430> it<00:02:44.489> it's<00:02:45.150> just<00:02:45.270> learning<00:02:45.900> but

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
get used to it it's just learning but

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.620 
get used to it it's just learning but
that<00:02:46.319> takes<00:02:46.500> that's<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:47.010> difficulty<00:02:47.610> so<00:02:47.850> if

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
that takes that's the difficulty so if

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.150 
that takes that's the difficulty so if
you<00:02:48.780> let<00:02:48.930> it<00:02:48.959> out<00:02:49.140> too<00:02:49.380> fast<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.860> bike<00:02:50.010> will

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
you let it out too fast the bike will

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.340 
you let it out too fast the bike will
probably<00:02:50.459> jerk<00:02:50.730> a<00:02:50.850> bit<00:02:51.030> but<00:02:51.840> nothing<00:02:51.989> too

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
probably jerk a bit but nothing too

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.840 
probably jerk a bit but nothing too
major<00:02:53.030> should<00:02:54.030> happen

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
major should happen

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.240 
major should happen
so<00:02:56.420> once<00:02:56.540> again<00:02:56.630> to<00:02:56.840> shift<00:02:57.080> back<00:02:57.200> down<00:02:57.500> quickly

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
so once again to shift back down quickly

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.030 
so once again to shift back down quickly
I'm<00:02:58.970> going<00:02:59.120> to<00:02:59.180> pull<00:02:59.360> in<00:02:59.450> my<00:02:59.570> clutch<00:02:59.890> I'm<00:03:00.890> going

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
I'm going to pull in my clutch I'm going

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.480 
I'm going to pull in my clutch I'm going
to<00:03:01.130> shift<00:03:01.310> down<00:03:01.430> now<00:03:02.030> as<00:03:02.270> i'm<00:03:02.600> releasing<00:03:03.560> the

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
to shift down now as i'm releasing the

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:05.740 
to shift down now as i'm releasing the
clutch<00:03:04.730> i'm<00:03:05.000> going<00:03:05.150> to<00:03:05.240> give<00:03:05.390> it<00:03:05.480> more

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
clutch i'm going to give it more

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:27.080 
clutch i'm going to give it more
acceleration<00:03:06.820> and<00:03:07.820> the

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.339 

and<00:03:27.660> it's<00:03:28.530> perfectly<00:03:29.010> acceptable<00:03:29.190> to<00:03:30.349> shift

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
and it's perfectly acceptable to shift

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.839 
and it's perfectly acceptable to shift
down<00:03:31.470> twice<00:03:32.269> before<00:03:33.269> letting<00:03:33.690> out<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:34.050> clutch

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
down twice before letting out the clutch

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:37.190 
down twice before letting out the clutch
if<00:03:35.849> you<00:03:35.970> need<00:03:36.269> to<00:03:36.360> slow<00:03:36.510> down<00:03:36.540> a<00:03:36.720> bit<00:03:36.780> quicker

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
if you need to slow down a bit quicker

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.680 
if you need to slow down a bit quicker
rather<00:03:37.440> than<00:03:37.590> going<00:03:37.800> through<00:03:37.890> the<00:03:38.129> gears<00:03:38.690> I

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
rather than going through the gears I

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.839 
rather than going through the gears I
prefer<00:03:40.260> to<00:03:40.290> go<00:03:40.440> to<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.800> gears<00:03:41.040> when<00:03:41.340> when<00:03:41.819> I

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
prefer to go to the gears when when I

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.030 
prefer to go to the gears when when I
can<00:03:42.180> and<00:03:42.450> because<00:03:42.959> that<00:03:43.260> way<00:03:43.379> if<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.709> traffic

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
can and because that way if the traffic

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.400 
can and because that way if the traffic
starts<00:03:44.370> moving<00:03:44.400> again<00:03:44.760> for<00:03:45.120> example<00:03:45.569> you're

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
starts moving again for example you're

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.530 
starts moving again for example you're
not<00:03:46.560> haven't<00:03:47.400> shifted<00:03:47.580> down<00:03:47.910> too<00:03:48.120> many<00:03:48.299> gears

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
not haven't shifted down too many gears

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.199 
not haven't shifted down too many gears
still<00:03:48.930> know<00:03:49.080> what<00:03:49.290> gear<00:03:49.530> you're<00:03:49.680> in<00:03:49.739> and<00:03:50.209> you

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
still know what gear you're in and you

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.320 
still know what gear you're in and you
don't<00:03:51.420> have<00:03:51.569> a<00:03:52.340> hard<00:03:53.340> time<00:03:53.580> getting<00:03:53.940> getting

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
don't have a hard time getting getting

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.050 
don't have a hard time getting getting
yourself<00:03:54.720> back<00:03:54.900> on<00:03:55.049> track

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.550 

so<00:03:58.690> when<00:03:59.440> learning<00:03:59.709> sip<00:04:00.640> shift<00:04:01.300> down<00:04:01.540> one<00:04:01.840> by

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
so when learning sip shift down one by

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.900 
so when learning sip shift down one by
one<00:04:02.800> because<00:04:03.130> that<00:04:03.160> way<00:04:03.430> you'll<00:04:03.610> get<00:04:03.730> more

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
one because that way you'll get more

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.660 
one because that way you'll get more
practice<00:04:04.090> it<00:04:04.480> that<00:04:05.040> releasing<00:04:06.040> the<00:04:06.130> clutch<00:04:06.370> on

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
practice it that releasing the clutch on

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.790 
practice it that releasing the clutch on
the<00:04:06.700> clutch<00:04:06.819> in<00:04:07.239> and<00:04:07.480> it'll<00:04:08.200> become<00:04:08.319> second

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
the clutch in and it'll become second

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.490 
the clutch in and it'll become second
nature<00:04:08.830> in<00:04:09.130> no<00:04:09.250> time<00:04:09.459> and<00:04:09.849> then<00:04:10.720> you<00:04:11.349> have<00:04:11.440> a

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
nature in no time and then you have a

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.290 
nature in no time and then you have a
little<00:04:11.709> bit<00:04:11.800> more<00:04:12.310> experience<00:04:12.610> if<00:04:13.060> you<00:04:13.180> know

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
little bit more experience if you know

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.970 
little bit more experience if you know
what<00:04:13.390> you're<00:04:13.480> doing<00:04:13.690> if<00:04:13.780> you<00:04:13.840> do<00:04:14.050> but<00:04:14.800> light

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
what you're doing if you do but light

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.409 
what you're doing if you do but light
see<00:04:15.310> if<00:04:15.370> it's<00:04:15.550> definitely<00:04:15.970> going<00:04:16.090> to<00:04:16.150> be<00:04:16.209> read

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
see if it's definitely going to be read

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.830 
see if it's definitely going to be read
for<00:04:16.570> a<00:04:16.630> while<00:04:16.690> you<00:04:17.049> can<00:04:17.169> sit<00:04:17.440> down<00:04:17.470> twice<00:04:17.919> and

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
for a while you can sit down twice and

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.449 
for a while you can sit down twice and
then<00:04:19.840> release<00:04:20.200> I<00:04:20.470> mean<00:04:20.620> all<00:04:20.769> that<00:04:20.919> happens<00:04:21.310> is

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
then release I mean all that happens is

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.520 
then release I mean all that happens is
that<00:04:21.519> you<00:04:22.389> just<00:04:22.540> let<00:04:22.750> the<00:04:22.870> clutch<00:04:22.900> out<00:04:23.200> after

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
that you just let the clutch out after

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:29.719 
that you just let the clutch out after
you<00:04:23.590> kick<00:04:23.830> down<00:04:24.040> twice<00:04:24.340> again

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:33.079
