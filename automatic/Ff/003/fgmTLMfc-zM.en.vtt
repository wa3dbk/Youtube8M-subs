up<00:01:43.649> it's<00:01:43.860> kind<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.040> hard<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.250> see<00:01:44.399> because<00:01:44.460> it's

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
up it's kind of hard to see because it's

tape<00:01:44.880> I'm<00:01:45.030> sorry<00:01:45.240> about<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:45.479> but<00:01:45.899> it's<00:01:46.680> just

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
tape I'm sorry about that but it's just

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.109 
tape I'm sorry about that but it's just
too<00:01:47.070> simple<00:01:48.710> it's<00:01:49.710> basically<00:01:50.640> one<00:01:50.909> wire<00:01:51.090> going

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
too simple it's basically one wire going

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.539 
too simple it's basically one wire going
to<00:01:51.509> another<00:01:51.659> end<00:01:51.960> when<00:01:52.649> it's<00:01:53.070> just<00:01:53.189> hooking<00:01:53.369> up

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
to another end when it's just hooking up

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.590 
to another end when it's just hooking up
two<00:01:53.700> ends<00:01:53.880> basic<00:01:54.860> close<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:56.040> up<00:01:58.130> very<00:01:59.130> sturdy

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
two ends basic close it up very sturdy

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.850 
two ends basic close it up very sturdy
I'll<00:02:00.600> screw<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:00.960> back<00:02:01.079> on<00:02:01.290> after<00:02:01.469> I<00:02:01.649> show<00:02:01.829> you

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
I'll screw it back on after I show you

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.620 
I'll screw it back on after I show you
this<00:02:03.649> so<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.920> have<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.189> set<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.670> change<00:02:06.180> banks

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
this so I have it set to change banks

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.940 
this so I have it set to change banks
you<00:02:07.259> can<00:02:07.439> also<00:02:07.560> set<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.129> do<00:02:08.670> tap<00:02:08.910> tempo<00:02:09.950> so

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
you can also set it to do tap tempo so

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.770 
you can also set it to do tap tempo so
plug<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.340> into<00:02:11.430> my<00:02:11.520> zoom<00:02:11.819> 82<00:02:12.450> point<00:02:12.690> when<00:02:12.810> you
