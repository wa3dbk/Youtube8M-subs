said<00:05:44.960> the<00:05:45.960> balance<00:05:46.440> is<00:05:46.560> right<00:05:46.800> here<00:05:47.300> as<00:05:48.300> you

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
said the balance is right here as you

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.250 
said the balance is right here as you
can<00:05:48.570> see<00:05:49.190> that's<00:05:50.190> balanced<00:05:50.640> number<00:05:50.880> one<00:05:51.260> the

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
can see that's balanced number one the

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.750 
can see that's balanced number one the
balance<00:05:52.650> number<00:05:52.860> two<00:05:53.040> is<00:05:53.190> right<00:05:53.400> behind<00:05:53.550> the

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.090 
there's a as you can see could you see
their<00:06:45.360> sequencing<00:06:46.110> when<00:06:46.290> i<00:06:46.320> turn<00:06:46.650> the<00:06:46.890> clicker

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:47.100 
their sequencing when i turn the clicker

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.860 
their sequencing when i turn the clicker
or<00:06:47.250> you<00:06:47.910> can't<00:06:48.150> really<00:06:48.240> see<00:06:48.360> the<00:06:48.510> clicker<00:06:48.750> i

have the light i had the lights on the

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.280 
have the light i had the lights on the
sequencing<00:06:51.950> so<00:06:52.950> that's<00:06:53.130> pretty<00:06:53.310> cool<00:06:53.400> and

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:56.810 
sequencing so that's pretty cool and
other<00:06:55.290> side<00:06:55.620> when<00:06:55.830> i<00:06:55.890> click<00:06:56.310> the<00:06:56.430> left<00:06:56.580> click

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:56.820 
other side when i click the left click

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:08.120 
other side when i click the left click
on<00:06:57.110> they<00:06:58.110> don't<00:06:58.320> sequence<00:07:01.850> but<00:07:02.850> they<00:07:03.060> are<00:07:07.130> they

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:08.130 
on they don't sequence but they are they

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:10.010 
on they don't sequence but they are they
don't<00:07:08.310> sequence<00:07:08.790> but<00:07:09.060> they<00:07:09.270> they<00:07:09.540> do<00:07:09.690> cuddle

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:12.030 
on straight cuz i only have one chip

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.290 
on straight cuz i only have one chip
don't<00:07:12.720> let<00:07:12.870> that<00:07:12.990> one<00:07:13.200> chip<00:07:13.440> so<00:07:13.710> yeah<00:07:14.210> just<00:07:15.210> a
