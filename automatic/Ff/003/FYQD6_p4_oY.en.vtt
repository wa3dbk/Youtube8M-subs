in<00:00:00.570> this<00:00:00.870> lesson<00:00:01.110> I<00:00:01.530> will<00:00:01.650> talk<00:00:01.979> about<00:00:02.159> muscle

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
in this lesson I will talk about muscle

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.140 
in this lesson I will talk about muscle
spindles<00:00:03.710> muscle<00:00:04.710> spindles<00:00:05.250> are<00:00:05.640> sensory

intrafusal<00:02:28.650> muscle<00:02:28.790> fibers<00:02:34.670> those<00:02:35.670> are<00:02:35.879> the

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
intrafusal muscle fibers those are the

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:38.089 
intrafusal muscle fibers those are the

the scratch impulses resulting from the
extension<00:02:41.549> of<00:02:41.639> the<00:02:41.819> muscle<00:02:42.530> so<00:02:43.530> this<00:02:43.709> is<00:02:43.829> the<00:02:43.920> a

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
extension of the muscle so this is the a

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.580 
extension of the muscle so this is the a
very<00:02:44.459> good<00:02:44.760> it<00:02:45.450> takes<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:45.959> information<00:02:46.049> about

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
very good it takes the information about

the<00:04:09.659> nuclear<00:04:10.019> bag<00:04:10.319> fiber<00:04:12.349> then<00:04:13.349> we<00:04:13.590> had<00:04:13.829> the

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
the nuclear bag fiber then we had the

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:19.689 
the nuclear bag fiber then we had the
primary<00:04:15.979> animals<00:04:16.979> spiral<00:04:17.549> neuron<00:04:17.909> endings

primary animals spiral neuron endings

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:23.959 
primary animals spiral neuron endings
and<00:04:20.699> we<00:04:21.419> also<00:04:21.690> had<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.380> secondary<00:04:23.099> flower

00:04:23.959 --> 00:04:23.969 
and we also had the secondary flower

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:27.590 
and we also had the secondary flower
spray<00:04:24.510> neuron<00:04:24.930> endings<00:04:25.820> now<00:04:26.820> I<00:04:26.849> want<00:04:27.240> to

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
spray neuron endings now I want to

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.050 
spray neuron endings now I want to
dad<00:04:27.810> the<00:04:28.050> nuclear<00:04:28.440> bag<00:04:28.710> fibers<00:04:29.220> can<00:04:29.520> sense<00:04:29.850> the

dad the nuclear bag fibers can sense the

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.480 
dad the nuclear bag fibers can sense the
onset<00:04:30.540> scratch<00:04:33.650> while<00:04:34.650> the<00:04:34.860> nuclear<00:04:35.190> chain

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
onset scratch while the nuclear chain

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:41.750 
onset scratch while the nuclear chain
fibers<00:04:35.940> can<00:04:36.390> sense<00:04:36.720> to<00:04:36.900> sustain<00:04:37.350> scratch<00:04:40.760> but

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
fibers can sense to sustain scratch but

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.030 
fibers can sense to sustain scratch but
they<00:04:41.940> can<00:04:42.150> both<00:04:42.420> sense<00:04:42.990> the<00:04:43.260> rapid<00:04:43.710> scratch

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
they can both sense the rapid scratch

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.260 
they can both sense the rapid scratch
that<00:04:44.940> is<00:04:45.180> way<00:04:45.780> more<00:04:46.050> important<00:04:46.910> I'll<00:04:47.910> just

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
that is way more important I'll just

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:56.530 
that is way more important I'll just
write<00:04:48.510> it<00:04:48.690> here<00:04:49.550> point<00:04:50.550> it<00:04:50.790> out<00:04:52.070> rapid<00:04:54.950> scratch

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
write it here point it out rapid scratch

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.120 
write it here point it out rapid scratch
now<00:04:57.540> that<00:04:57.750> is<00:04:57.870> really<00:04:58.650> important<00:04:59.100> for

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
now that is really important for

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:02.240 
now that is really important for
reflexes<00:04:59.910> I'll<00:05:00.840> explain<00:05:01.080> it<00:05:01.410> like<00:05:01.500> this<00:05:01.740> let's

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
reflexes I'll explain it like this let's

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.080 
reflexes I'll explain it like this let's
say<00:05:02.430> if<00:05:02.910> this<00:05:03.480> is<00:05:03.690> you<00:05:03.870> and<00:05:04.760> you're<00:05:05.760> holding

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
say if this is you and you're holding

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.340 
say if this is you and you're holding
your<00:05:06.210> hands<00:05:06.540> like<00:05:06.750> this<00:05:06.810> okay<00:05:07.970> somebody<00:05:08.970> drops

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
your hands like this okay somebody drops

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.280 
your hands like this okay somebody drops
40<00:05:10.350> pounds<00:05:10.830> on<00:05:11.010> your<00:05:11.610> hands<00:05:12.030> this<00:05:12.870> will<00:05:13.050> cause

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
40 pounds on your hands this will cause

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.870 
40 pounds on your hands this will cause
a<00:05:13.650> rapid<00:05:14.220> scratch<00:05:14.760> of<00:05:14.970> your<00:05:15.180> muscles<00:05:16.520> okay<00:05:17.520> and

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
a rapid scratch of your muscles okay and

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.540 
a rapid scratch of your muscles okay and
then<00:05:18.870> what<00:05:19.050> happens<00:05:19.500> we<00:05:19.860> have<00:05:20.070> the<00:05:20.220> scratch

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
then what happens we have the scratch

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.350 
then what happens we have the scratch
here<00:05:21.000> going<00:05:21.570> on<00:05:21.750> in<00:05:22.200> the<00:05:23.130> acts<00:05:23.340> refusal<00:05:24.060> muscle

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
here going on in the acts refusal muscle

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.630 
here going on in the acts refusal muscle
fibers<00:05:24.750> and<00:05:24.960> because<00:05:25.740> the<00:05:25.860> ant<00:05:26.040> refusal

they send it to the spinal cord and in

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.910 
they send it to the spinal cord and in
the<00:05:40.050> spinal<00:05:40.380> cord<00:05:41.480> this<00:05:42.480> signal<00:05:42.990> fires<00:05:43.620> the

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.550 

now<00:05:53.370> let's<00:05:53.580> say<00:05:53.700> to<00:05:53.760> be<00:05:53.970> modern<00:05:54.330> iran<00:05:54.600> from<00:05:55.410> the

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
now let's say to be modern iran from the

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.790 
now let's say to be modern iran from the
spinal<00:05:55.980> cord<00:05:56.810> trigger<00:05:57.810> the<00:05:58.050> contraction<00:05:58.680> of

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
spinal cord trigger the contraction of

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.330 
spinal cord trigger the contraction of
the<00:05:58.860> extra<00:05:59.490> fuse<00:05:59.730> or<00:05:59.760> muscle<00:06:00.240> fibers<00:06:01.130> and<00:06:02.130> now

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
the extra fuse or muscle fibers and now

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.910 
the extra fuse or muscle fibers and now
the<00:06:02.400> situation<00:06:02.760> that<00:06:03.330> we<00:06:03.450> have<00:06:03.690> is<00:06:04.380> not<00:06:04.650> the

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:04.920 
the situation that we have is not the

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.190 
the situation that we have is not the
muscle<00:06:05.280> scratchy<00:06:05.610> but<00:06:06.540> does<00:06:06.780> the<00:06:06.960> quite

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:07.200 
muscle scratchy but does the quite

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.820 
muscle scratchy but does the quite
opposite<00:06:08.450> so<00:06:09.450> if<00:06:09.600> the<00:06:09.750> extra<00:06:10.110> fuse<00:06:10.350> or<00:06:10.380> muscle

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830 
opposite so if the extra fuse or muscle

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.870 
opposite so if the extra fuse or muscle
fibers<00:06:11.280> are<00:06:11.600> becoming<00:06:12.600> shorter<00:06:13.880> the

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 
fibers are becoming shorter the

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.240 
fibers are becoming shorter the
intrafusal<00:06:15.540> muscle<00:06:15.570> fibers<00:06:16.530> would<00:06:16.890> simply

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.250 
intrafusal muscle fibers would simply

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:20.660 
intrafusal muscle fibers would simply
become<00:06:17.670> slack<00:06:19.160> they<00:06:20.160> wouldn't<00:06:20.490> become

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:20.670 
become slack they wouldn't become

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:22.520 
become slack they wouldn't become
shorter<00:06:21.240> because<00:06:21.450> they<00:06:21.690> did<00:06:21.900> not<00:06:21.930> contract

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.530 
shorter because they did not contract

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.760 
shorter because they did not contract
and<00:06:22.860> that<00:06:23.210> would<00:06:24.210> cause<00:06:24.480> no<00:06:25.260> more<00:06:25.440> signal

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:25.770 
and that would cause no more signal

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.790 
and that would cause no more signal
going<00:06:26.310> to<00:06:26.520> spinal<00:06:26.820> cord<00:06:27.440> because<00:06:28.440> those<00:06:28.590> nerve

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
going to spinal cord because those nerve

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.590 
going to spinal cord because those nerve
endings<00:06:29.250> are<00:06:29.430> stimulated<00:06:30.030> by<00:06:30.150> the<00:06:30.210> scratch

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:30.600 
endings are stimulated by the scratch

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.260 
endings are stimulated by the scratch
impulses<00:06:31.320> and<00:06:31.500> if<00:06:32.130> the<00:06:32.280> interviews<00:06:32.820> or<00:06:32.970> muscle

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
impulses and if the interviews or muscle

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.110 
impulses and if the interviews or muscle
fibers<00:06:33.660> are<00:06:33.840> slack<00:06:34.250> then<00:06:35.250> we<00:06:35.640> have<00:06:35.760> no<00:06:35.970> more

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 
fibers are slack then we have no more

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.680 
fibers are slack then we have no more

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:39.690 
signal the preferred this from happening

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:41.420

what<00:06:40.620> we<00:06:40.740> need

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:41.430 
what we need

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.700 
what we need
is<00:06:41.520> a<00:06:41.850> motor<00:06:42.240> neuron<00:06:42.660> that<00:06:42.690> will<00:06:43.080> innovate<00:06:43.350> the

interviews<00:06:44.460> or<00:06:44.640> muscle<00:06:44.970> fibers<00:06:47.030> so<00:06:48.030> this

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:48.210 
interviews or muscle fibers so this

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.720 
interviews or muscle fibers so this
motor<00:06:48.570> neuron<00:06:48.990> is<00:06:49.680> supposed<00:06:50.130> to<00:06:50.280> innervate
