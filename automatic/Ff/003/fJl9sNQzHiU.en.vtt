00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
and you just you're almost anxious to

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.580 
and you just you're almost anxious to
get<00:00:45.059> started<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.629> show<00:00:45.899> what<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.110> can<00:00:46.140> do<00:00:46.410> I

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
get started and show what you can do I

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.290 
get started and show what you can do I
think<00:00:47.010> for<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.280> two<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.460> us<00:00:47.700> at<00:00:47.879> least<00:00:47.910> it's

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
think for the two of us at least it's

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.680 
think for the two of us at least it's
been<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.890> great<00:00:49.890> way<00:00:50.100> for<00:00:50.160> us<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:51.329> kind<00:00:51.600> of

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
been a great way for us to to kind of

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.340 
been a great way for us to to kind of
break<00:00:51.899> in<00:00:52.110> with<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.289> group<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:53.989> think<00:00:54.989> I

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
break in with a group and I think I

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.090 
break in with a group and I think I
certainly<00:00:56.280> used<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.730> as<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.660> way<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:57.960> get<00:00:58.590> on<00:00:58.739> on

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
certainly used it as a way to get on on

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.240 
certainly used it as a way to get on on
the<00:00:59.399> coaching<00:00:59.609> staffs<00:01:00.000> radar<00:01:01.100> so<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.129> think

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
the coaching staffs radar so I think

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.399 
the coaching staffs radar so I think
it's<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.910> great<00:01:03.030> way<00:01:03.239> for<00:01:03.300> for<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.170> lot<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.320> the

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
it's a great way for for a lot of the

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.060 
it's a great way for for a lot of the
guys<00:01:04.559> here<00:01:04.860> now<00:01:05.040> who<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:06.590> are<00:01:07.590> in<00:01:07.710> with<00:01:07.890> it

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070

but again I mean I'm excited there's
still<00:03:14.880> a<00:03:14.910> lot<00:03:15.120> to<00:03:15.150> prove<00:03:15.480> for<00:03:15.720> me<00:03:15.870> so<00:03:16.650> in<00:03:17.160> some

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
still a lot to prove for me so in some

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.540 
still a lot to prove for me so in some
sense<00:03:17.459> it<00:03:17.880> feels<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:18.600> same<00:03:18.860> but<00:03:19.860> in<00:03:19.950> others<00:03:20.220> I

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
sense it feels the same but in others I

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.090 
sense it feels the same but in others I
definitely<00:03:20.940> feel<00:03:21.270> older<00:03:21.660> and<00:03:21.900> I<00:03:22.500> almost<00:03:22.890> feel

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
definitely feel older and I almost feel

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.370 
definitely feel older and I almost feel
like<00:03:23.160> a<00:03:23.310> veteran<00:03:23.550> not<00:03:23.940> quite<00:03:24.290> because<00:03:25.290> I'm

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
like a veteran not quite because I'm

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.660 
like a veteran not quite because I'm
only<00:03:25.530> 26<00:03:26.070> but<00:03:26.430> I<00:03:26.670> kind<00:03:27.209> of<00:03:27.239> feel<00:03:27.360> like<00:03:27.420> a<00:03:27.510> better
