00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.670
 we are fishing there 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.489
 then supported by charlemagne 

00:00:08.489 --> 00:00:10.079
 will be 

00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:13.079
 on the river ardeche we have on the commune of vallon-pont-d'arc 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.179
 it was a quick one of the first happy days at the entrance 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:19.409
 really gorges of buying art 

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:21.779
 the decent buying art in the truck lane 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.890
 however an office train five kilometers long 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.040
 it is a place that is very practiced by the canals and over the period 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:29.519
 summer 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.870
 on this period when we do not have a runner an influx of 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.640
 canoes and kayaks because the waters are still a little cold 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.300
 it's really the beginning of the season 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.800
 the arena a water that was currently about 9 degrees 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.360
 so stop cold enough for growth and start either 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.090
 Baku - Serbian or Suez 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.100
 so here I do not think it a little bit on everything but not running 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.060
 because it's so able to start going back up the 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.520
 but percent and it's not yet very active 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.550
 in power the most active period in the month of May play 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.770
 dates the waters will warm up the bar 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.860
 then there in patagonia can reach rates that reach the 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.140
 temperatures had to 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.140
 nice beast to see them anymore 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.330
 but seguela 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:45.770
 penalty and glass 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.790
 so that it goes back 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.130
 on the movie 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.390
 and we let exceed about 2 3 5 6 meters we must not leave too much 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.310
 exceed 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.440
 because often waiting for the crescent hatch 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.440
 when they want to cut behind and often they do not prick themselves 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.920
 but it's still important goods offered to the climbs the green on 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.390
 the queue and not let him go 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.579
 but what matters is when you do not want 

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:10.699
 the microphone our valiant in a town hall 

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:12.219
 the mosson in the other 

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:15.340
 he must not have any breakage between the lead shots for his passion 

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:16.519
 good for me 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.699
 so that its descent from bienne to running water 

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:22.659
 and that the casting is relatively constant 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:25.719
 so it's important to have a neon son to really be able to 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:29.119
 see progress casting in the current of the good follow 

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:32.179
 Dessureault could be attentive to the least squares 

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:34.549
 at the slightest change of new tuesday 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:37.859
 it's a scene and terraferma the presence of the fish clearly seen if we 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:41.159
 did not feel directly in the film sometimes it's a pretty fine task 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.409
 and so it's just stopping the ficam that has detected the fish you 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:48.390
 what and so there will perigny 80 gold is true that you often but 

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:51.409
 to do it for nothing because it may be the 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:54.349
 the karate worm train him in the neighborhood had been the line 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.349
 but hey it is better to get up for ya times 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.049
 28 years missed a fish 

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:05.999
 here is one 

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:07.959
 and then on the end of the course 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.359
 do not you think a little on the side 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:12.809
 three sets for the fish 

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:14.799
 this bosses forum 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:16.959
 it will be 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.329
 but not very combative 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:22.329
 not too much energy at that time 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:27.159
 the related like that 

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:33.429
 yeah we're on the water 

00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:36.429
 bring us closer 

00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:57.939
 the solution n 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:03:59.490
 about 40 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.439
 45 centimeters 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:03.379
 a quad corner fish 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:05.999
 so not be the only one in my opinion 

00:04:05.999 --> 00:04:08.399
 in front of his colleagues 

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:11.029
 montea chevesnes ardÃ©chois 

00:04:11.029 --> 00:04:13.649
 there are not bad anyway in the sector 

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:17.099
 these fish that are usually caught at stepanek bo are not too much 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:18.809
 nervousness because 

00:04:18.809 --> 00:04:21.849
 and his coolness from his energy emmenus companion 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:24.849
 are not immensely magic given that we are an early season 

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:29.189
 but it's still fish that is fun to catch 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.740
 for van der vaart dropped in the morning around a blown glass 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:39.699
 I find his level 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:40.490
 it will be quieter
