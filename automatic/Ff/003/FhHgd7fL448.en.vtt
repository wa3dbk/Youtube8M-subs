satellite technology from today so we've

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.000

channel<00:01:45.329> chop<00:01:46.290> their<00:01:46.470> payload<00:01:46.860> over<00:01:47.280> over

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
channel chop their payload over over

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.969 
channel chop their payload over over
London<00:01:48.390> so<00:01:48.780> our<00:01:49.170> objective<00:01:49.290> our<00:01:49.740> primary

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
London so our objective our primary

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.889 
London so our objective our primary
objective<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.579> go<00:01:50.700> in<00:01:50.850> there<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.210> engage

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
objective is to go in there and engage

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.389 
objective is to go in there and engage
these<00:01:52.290> eight<00:01:52.470> Bombers<00:01:52.829> as<00:01:52.950> they<00:01:53.070> come<00:01:53.220> over

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
these eight Bombers as they come over

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.000 
these eight Bombers as they come over
the<00:01:53.460> countryside<00:01:55.009> so<00:01:56.009> here<00:01:56.159> we<00:01:56.250> are

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
the countryside so here we are

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.070 
the countryside so here we are
now<00:01:58.970> laws<00:01:59.180> are<00:01:59.300> saying<00:01:59.480> we<00:01:59.630> played<00:01:59.840> this<00:01:59.960> in

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
now laws are saying we played this in

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.540 
now laws are saying we played this in
arcade<00:02:00.410> mode<00:02:00.590> so<00:02:01.100> I'm<00:02:01.250> going<00:02:01.370> to<00:02:01.400> have<00:02:01.520> a

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
arcade mode so I'm going to have a

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.030 
arcade mode so I'm going to have a
limited<00:02:01.910> fuel<00:02:02.120> unlimited<00:02:02.990> weaponry<00:02:03.440> and

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
limited fuel unlimited weaponry and

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.580 
limited fuel unlimited weaponry and
ammunition<00:02:04.910> etc

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.390 

so<00:02:09.429> here<00:02:09.610> we<00:02:09.700> go<00:02:10.590> we<00:02:11.590> look<00:02:11.739> behind<00:02:12.010> this<00:02:12.129> field

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
so here we go we look behind this field

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.369 
so here we go we look behind this field
we<00:02:12.580> see<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:12.849> rest<00:02:13.000> of<00:02:13.120> our<00:02:13.209> squadron<00:02:13.690> so<00:02:14.110> there

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:14.379 
we see the rest of our squadron so there

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.339 
we see the rest of our squadron so there
are<00:02:14.410> only<00:02:15.220> 20<00:02:15.910> other<00:02:16.450> three<00:02:16.690> Spitfires<00:02:17.110> and

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
are only 20 other three Spitfires and

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.309 
are only 20 other three Spitfires and
this<00:02:17.950> here<00:02:18.220> is<00:02:18.370> our<00:02:19.209> main<00:02:19.720> objective<00:02:19.870> now

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
this here is our main objective now

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:21.570 
this here is our main objective now
you'll<00:02:20.440> see<00:02:20.650> there<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:21.099> top<00:02:21.250> of<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.400> screen

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
you'll see there the top of the screen

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.050 
you'll see there the top of the screen
we've<00:02:21.819> got<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.000> Aichi<00:02:22.300> 111<00:02:22.810> and<00:02:24.060> 250

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
we've got the Aichi 111 and 250

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.670 
we've got the Aichi 111 and 250
kilometres<00:02:25.540> that's<00:02:25.750> a<00:02:26.019> deflection<00:02:26.500> that

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
kilometres that's a deflection that

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.410 
kilometres that's a deflection that
tells<00:02:26.980> us<00:02:27.129> the<00:02:27.310> make<00:02:27.670> of<00:02:27.849> the<00:02:27.879> planes<00:02:28.120> and<00:02:28.360> how

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
tells us the make of the planes and how

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.509 
tells us the make of the planes and how
far<00:02:28.629> away<00:02:28.720> they<00:02:28.959> are<00:02:28.989> 48<00:02:29.830> bombers<00:02:30.190> there<00:02:30.370> but

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
far away they are 48 bombers there but

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.100 
far away they are 48 bombers there but
the<00:02:30.580> closer<00:02:30.819> we<00:02:30.970> get<00:02:31.120> in<00:02:31.330> there<00:02:31.540> we<00:02:31.599> realized

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
the closer we get in there we realized

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.030 
the closer we get in there we realized
there's<00:02:32.410> something<00:02:32.709> not<00:02:32.799> quite<00:02:32.860> right

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
there's something not quite right

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.930 
there's something not quite right
there's<00:02:33.849> actually<00:02:34.330> not<00:02:34.510> just<00:02:34.810> ate<00:02:35.760> but<00:02:36.760> our

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
there's actually not just ate but our

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.759 
there's actually not just ate but our
information<00:02:37.660> was<00:02:37.780> incorrect<00:02:37.930> we've<00:02:38.620> actually

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
information was incorrect we've actually

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:43.410 
information was incorrect we've actually
got<00:02:39.099> 50<00:02:41.099> German<00:02:42.099> bombers<00:02:42.400> so<00:02:43.120> our<00:02:43.269> main

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
got 50 German bombers so our main

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.170 
got 50 German bombers so our main
objective<00:02:43.599> now<00:02:44.019> is<00:02:44.049> to<00:02:44.290> survive<00:02:44.940> to<00:02:45.940> make<00:02:46.060> it<00:02:46.150> a

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
objective now is to survive to make it a

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.330 
objective now is to survive to make it a
go<00:02:46.329> in<00:02:46.450> here<00:02:46.569> now<00:02:46.750> and<00:02:46.989> take<00:02:47.470> as<00:02:47.650> many<00:02:48.010> of<00:02:48.250> these

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
go in here now and take as many of these

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.740 
go in here now and take as many of these
bombers<00:02:48.670> as<00:02:48.760> we<00:02:48.880> can<00:02:49.090> before<00:02:49.209> they<00:02:49.480> get<00:02:49.599> to

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
bombers as we can before they get to

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.309 
bombers as we can before they get to
London<00:02:51.239> they'll<00:02:52.239> just<00:02:52.569> scramble<00:02:53.200> the

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
London they'll just scramble the

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.020 
London they'll just scramble the
emergency<00:02:53.739> fighters<00:02:54.129> to<00:02:54.519> give<00:02:54.670> it<00:02:54.790> some<00:02:54.910> air

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
emergency fighters to give it some air

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:09.780 
emergency fighters to give it some air
support

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.170 

as<00:03:10.420> you<00:03:10.629> can<00:03:10.719> see<00:03:11.040> in<00:03:12.040> this<00:03:12.340> third<00:03:12.400> person<00:03:13.000> mode

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
as you can see in this third person mode

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.199 
as you can see in this third person mode
we've<00:03:13.450> got<00:03:13.599> really<00:03:13.900> great<00:03:14.290> control<00:03:14.620> system<00:03:15.209> we

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
we've got really great control system we

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.319 
we've got really great control system we
can<00:03:16.359> do<00:03:16.510> barrel<00:03:16.870> rolls<00:03:17.640> loop<00:03:18.640> the<00:03:18.670> loops<00:03:18.939> and

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
can do barrel rolls loop the loops and

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:20.759 
can do barrel rolls loop the loops and
everything<00:03:19.629> to<00:03:19.750> use<00:03:19.930> in<00:03:20.049> dogfighting<00:03:20.200> combat

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
everything to use in dogfighting combat

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.770 
everything to use in dogfighting combat
skills<00:03:21.010> okay<00:03:21.819> let's<00:03:22.030> engage<00:03:22.180> in<00:03:22.450> a<00:03:22.510> couple<00:03:22.750> of

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
skills okay let's engage in a couple of

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.759 
skills okay let's engage in a couple of
these<00:03:23.489> German<00:03:24.489> bombers<00:03:24.790> now<00:03:25.470> now<00:03:26.470> you'll<00:03:26.650> see

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
these German bombers now now you'll see

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:33.350 
these German bombers now now you'll see
the<00:03:26.890> targeting<00:03:27.220> system<00:03:27.340> that<00:03:27.549> we<00:03:27.609> have<00:03:27.640> here

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.870 

it<00:03:33.960> allows<00:03:34.230> you<00:03:34.530> to<00:03:35.040> because<00:03:35.520> obviously<00:03:35.670> the

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
it allows you to because obviously the

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.250 
it allows you to because obviously the
arc<00:03:36.030> of<00:03:36.150> a<00:03:36.210> bullet<00:03:36.510> and<00:03:36.690> speed<00:03:37.080> that<00:03:37.200> you

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
arc of a bullet and speed that you

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.810 
arc of a bullet and speed that you
trouble<00:03:38.000> changes<00:03:39.800> so<00:03:40.800> you<00:03:40.860> have<00:03:41.100> to<00:03:41.340> targeting

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
trouble changes so you have to targeting

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.400 
trouble changes so you have to targeting
systems<00:03:42.180> so<00:03:42.420> you've<00:03:42.750> actually<00:03:42.840> got<00:03:43.170> to<00:03:43.260> aim

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
systems so you've actually got to aim

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.440 
systems so you've actually got to aim
slightly<00:03:43.950> away<00:03:44.340> from<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.640> plane<00:03:44.850> for<00:03:45.060> example

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
slightly away from the plane for example

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.610 
slightly away from the plane for example
and<00:03:45.750> that<00:03:45.780> gives<00:03:46.350> you<00:03:48.260> the<00:03:49.260> right<00:03:49.440> trajectory

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
and that gives you the right trajectory

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.710 
and that gives you the right trajectory
and<00:03:50.250> distance<00:03:50.700> away<00:03:50.850> from<00:03:50.970> the<00:03:51.150> bullet<00:03:51.450> and

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
and distance away from the bullet and

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.360 
and distance away from the bullet and
you'll<00:03:54.720> see<00:03:54.930> the<00:03:55.080> way<00:03:55.140> that<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:55.380> planes<00:03:55.650> crash

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
you'll see the way that the planes crash

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.120 
you'll see the way that the planes crash
out<00:03:56.550> the<00:03:56.700> sky<00:03:56.910> seal<00:03:57.180> details<00:03:57.570> the<00:03:58.380> smoking<00:03:58.920> of

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
out the sky seal details the smoking of

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.560 
out the sky seal details the smoking of
the<00:03:59.250> fact<00:03:59.430> that<00:03:59.459> those<00:03:59.850> planes<00:04:00.240> just<00:04:00.330> won't

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
the fact that those planes just won't

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:01.550 
the fact that those planes just won't
disappear<00:04:00.900> in<00:04:01.020> the<00:04:01.080> sky<00:04:01.260> they'll<00:04:01.440> actually

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
disappear in the sky they'll actually

again there now each of the planes have

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.030 
again there now each of the planes have

and simulator mode for example you

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.580 
and simulator mode for example you
really<00:04:52.570> feel<00:04:52.810> the<00:04:52.930> difference<00:04:53.200> in<00:04:53.320> the<00:04:53.350> plane

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590
