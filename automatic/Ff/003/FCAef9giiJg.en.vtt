00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
all right so today we're going to talk a

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.320 
all right so today we're going to talk a
lot<00:00:05.549> about<00:00:05.580> football<00:00:06.390> equipment<00:00:07.280> fitting<00:00:08.330> and

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
lot about football equipment fitting and

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.299 
lot about football equipment fitting and
there's<00:00:09.960> obviously<00:00:10.500> all<00:00:10.740> kinds<00:00:11.010> of<00:00:11.040> sports

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
there's obviously all kinds of sports

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.419 
there's obviously all kinds of sports
that<00:00:11.460> have<00:00:11.730> equipment<00:00:12.630> needs<00:00:13.429> football

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
that have equipment needs football

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.700 
that have equipment needs football
happens<00:00:15.089> to<00:00:15.179> be<00:00:15.330> just<00:00:15.630> one<00:00:15.809> of<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.109> major<00:00:16.410> ones

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
happens to be just one of the major ones

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.310 
happens to be just one of the major ones
that<00:00:16.800> we<00:00:16.980> deal<00:00:17.160> with<00:00:17.190> hence<00:00:17.720> have<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:19.020> lot<00:00:19.289> of

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
that we deal with hence have a lot of

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.859 
that we deal with hence have a lot of
equipment<00:00:20.310> needs<00:00:20.460> so<00:00:20.730> we<00:00:20.760> just<00:00:21.060> kind<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:21.660> start

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
equipment needs so we just kind of start

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.060 
equipment needs so we just kind of start
with<00:00:21.900> this<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.410> then<00:00:22.470> use<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.890> same

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
with this and then use the same

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.880 
with this and then use the same
principles<00:00:23.609> for<00:00:24.320> football<00:00:25.320> equipment

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
principles for football equipment

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.589 
principles for football equipment
fitting<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.609> all<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.849> other<00:00:26.970> sports<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:27.390> we

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
fitting to all the other sports that we

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.910 
fitting to all the other sports that we
might<00:00:27.990> have<00:00:28.199> so<00:00:29.720> dealing<00:00:30.720> with<00:00:30.810> football<00:00:31.590> one

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
might have so dealing with football one

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:32.990 
might have so dealing with football one
of<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.040> things<00:00:32.160> we're<00:00:32.309> going<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.489> fit<00:00:32.730> here

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
of the things we're going to fit here

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.790 
of the things we're going to fit here
we're<00:00:33.360> going<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.510> do<00:00:33.660> helmet<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.530> shoulder

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
we're going to do helmet and shoulder

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.500 
we're going to do helmet and shoulder
pads<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:36.030> first<00:00:36.239> thing<00:00:36.329> that<00:00:36.420> we're

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
pads and the first thing that we're

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.549 
pads and the first thing that we're
going<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.660> do<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:36.960> we're<00:00:37.110> going<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.260> fit<00:00:37.410> those

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
going to do is we're going to fit those

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.700 
going to do is we're going to fit those
shoulder<00:00:37.980> pads<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:39.050> then<00:00:40.050> we'll<00:00:40.260> actually

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
shoulder pads and then we'll actually

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.280 
shoulder pads and then we'll actually
fit<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.489> helmet<00:00:41.790> in<00:00:41.940> conjunction<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:42.930> first

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
fit the helmet in conjunction so first

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.720 
fit the helmet in conjunction so first
thing<00:00:43.410> we'll<00:00:43.500> do<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:43.800> we'll<00:00:43.950> start<00:00:44.190> with<00:00:44.309> start

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
thing we'll do is we'll start with start

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.389 
thing we'll do is we'll start with start
with<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.940> shoulder<00:00:45.210> pads<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:46.379> as<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.710> general

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
with the shoulder pads and as a general

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.049 
with the shoulder pads and as a general
rule<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.610> thumb<00:00:47.840> shoulder<00:00:48.840> pads<00:00:49.079> are<00:00:50.059> have

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
rule of thumb shoulder pads are have

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.240 
rule of thumb shoulder pads are have
different<00:00:51.390> sizes<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.930> them<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:52.890> we<00:00:53.010> want

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
different sizes to them and so we want

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.889 
different sizes to them and so we want
to<00:00:53.340> try<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.520> do<00:00:53.760> is<00:00:53.910> want<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.210> figure<00:00:54.510> out<00:00:54.660> the

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
to try to do is want to figure out the

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.990 
to try to do is want to figure out the
appropriate<00:00:54.989> size<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:56.039> each<00:00:56.250> brand<00:00:56.610> fits

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
appropriate size and each brand fits

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.810 
appropriate size and each brand fits
slightly<00:00:57.870> different<00:00:58.309> but<00:00:59.309> for<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.520> most<00:00:59.670> part

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
slightly different but for the most part

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.360 
slightly different but for the most part
of<00:01:00.149> standard<00:01:00.539> rule<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.440> thumb<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.829> find<00:01:02.160> the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
of standard rule of thumb is to find the

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.170 
of standard rule of thumb is to find the
AC<00:01:02.750> on<00:01:03.750> each<00:01:03.989> side<00:01:04.369> so<00:01:05.369> from<00:01:05.610> this<00:01:05.729> point<00:01:06.030> at

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
AC on each side so from this point at

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.100 
AC on each side so from this point at
this<00:01:06.299> point<00:01:07.580> measuring<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.670> crossed<00:01:08.990> so<00:01:09.990> he's

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
this point measuring it crossed so he's

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.649 
this point measuring it crossed so he's
measuring<00:01:10.439> at<00:01:10.619> about<00:01:10.830> 16<00:01:11.430> inches<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:12.119> then

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
measuring at about 16 inches and then

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.240 
measuring at about 16 inches and then
I'm<00:01:12.869> most<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.470> shoulder<00:01:13.799> pads<00:01:14.040> they

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
I'm most of the shoulder pads they

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.100 
I'm most of the shoulder pads they
actually<00:01:14.610> have<00:01:14.729> some<00:01:15.090> type<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.570> measurement

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
actually have some type of measurement

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.490 
actually have some type of measurement
so<00:01:16.470> this<00:01:17.369> thing<00:01:17.580> here<00:01:17.790> says<00:01:18.030> 18<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.689> 19<00:01:18.720> inches

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
so this thing here says 18 to 19 inches

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.789 
so this thing here says 18 to 19 inches
so<00:01:19.770> we<00:01:20.689> might<00:01:21.689> be<00:01:21.869> at<00:01:21.960> risk<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.439> this<00:01:22.560> being

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
so we might be at risk of this being

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.910 
so we might be at risk of this being
just<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.159> little<00:01:23.189> bit<00:01:23.549> big<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:24.210> but<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:25.890> a

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
just a little bit big so but this is a

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.530 
just a little bit big so but this is a
large<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:26.610> we<00:01:26.640> might<00:01:26.850> need<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.090> go<00:01:27.210> down<00:01:27.360> to

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
large and so we might need to go down to

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.760 
large and so we might need to go down to
a<00:01:27.570> medium<00:01:27.780> or<00:01:28.080> vice<00:01:28.259> versa

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
a medium or vice versa

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.679 
a medium or vice versa
so<00:01:28.890> we'll<00:01:29.009> start<00:01:29.280> with<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.610> kind<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.270> see<00:01:30.479> where

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
so we'll start with it kind of see where

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.040 
so we'll start with it kind of see where
where<00:01:31.049> we<00:01:31.170> get<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.909> see<00:01:32.909> what<00:01:33.060> happens<00:01:33.360> so

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
where we get to see what happens so

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.900 
where we get to see what happens so
the<00:01:35.590> athlete<00:01:35.920> is<00:01:36.040> going<00:01:36.100> to<00:01:36.460> put<00:01:36.640> the<00:01:36.730> shoulder

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:36.910 
the athlete is going to put the shoulder

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.550 
the athlete is going to put the shoulder
pads<00:01:37.270> over<00:01:38.640> their<00:01:39.640> shoulders<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:41.290> want<00:01:41.320> to

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
pads over their shoulders you want to

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.990 
pads over their shoulders you want to
make<00:01:41.680> sure<00:01:41.860> that<00:01:42.100> they<00:01:42.310> are<00:01:42.520> then<00:01:42.790> strapped<00:01:43.270> up

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
make sure that they are then strapped up

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.800 
make sure that they are then strapped up
and<00:01:47.070> now<00:01:48.070> once<00:01:48.370> they're<00:01:48.580> on<00:01:48.790> we<00:01:49.390> want<00:01:49.600> to<00:01:49.660> stay

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
and now once they're on we want to stay

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.960 
and now once they're on we want to stay
ok<00:01:50.140> you<00:01:50.410> know<00:01:50.500> how<00:01:50.650> do<00:01:50.710> these<00:01:50.890> typically<00:01:51.700> look

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
ok you know how do these typically look

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.010 
ok you know how do these typically look
so<00:01:52.150> there's<00:01:52.300> a<00:01:52.330> couple<00:01:52.510> different<00:01:52.870> pieces

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
so there's a couple different pieces

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.380 
so there's a couple different pieces
that<00:01:53.380> we<00:01:53.500> want<00:01:53.710> to<00:01:53.770> want<00:01:54.760> to<00:01:54.850> be<00:01:54.940> looking<00:01:55.240> at

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
that we want to want to be looking at

completely gets the scapula's because

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.140 
completely gets the scapula's because
those<00:02:22.209> are<00:02:22.390> too<00:02:23.140> problematic<00:02:23.800> areas<00:02:24.160> and<00:02:25.000> on

those are too problematic areas and on

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.370 
those are too problematic areas and on
the<00:02:25.239> sides<00:02:25.480> here<00:02:25.870> you<00:02:25.989> have<00:02:26.080> a<00:02:26.200> couple

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
the sides here you have a couple

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.030 
the sides here you have a couple
different<00:02:27.060> flaps<00:02:28.060> okay<00:02:28.840> so<00:02:29.470> you<00:02:29.530> have<00:02:29.770> kind<00:02:29.950> of

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
different flaps okay so you have kind of

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.400 
different flaps okay so you have kind of
an<00:02:30.160> inner<00:02:30.280> flap<00:02:30.610> and<00:02:30.850> an<00:02:30.940> outer<00:02:31.120> flap<00:02:31.480> this

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
an inner flap and an outer flap this

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.860 
an inner flap and an outer flap this
piece<00:02:32.739> right<00:02:33.010> here<00:02:33.070> of<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:33.940> shoulder<00:02:34.270> of<00:02:34.570> the

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
piece right here of the shoulder of the

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.070 
piece right here of the shoulder of the
kind<00:02:35.500> of<00:02:35.560> inside<00:02:36.010> pad<00:02:36.370> should<00:02:37.060> extend<00:02:37.690> just

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
kind of inside pad should extend just

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.940 
kind of inside pad should extend just
slightly<00:02:38.830> beyond<00:02:39.730> the<00:02:40.299> shoulders<00:02:40.780> ok<00:02:41.350> so<00:02:41.410> then

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
slightly beyond the shoulders ok so then

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.670 
slightly beyond the shoulders ok so then
as<00:02:42.280> this<00:02:43.060> comes<00:02:43.480> down<00:02:43.720> and<00:02:44.019> this<00:02:44.200> comes<00:02:44.470> down

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
as this comes down and this comes down

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.039 
as this comes down and this comes down
it<00:02:44.890> completely<00:02:45.430> covers<00:02:45.760> the<00:02:45.940> deltoid<00:02:46.390> so<00:02:46.959> it's

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
it completely covers the deltoid so it's

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.140 
it completely covers the deltoid so it's
very<00:02:47.200> important<00:02:47.739> that<00:02:47.769> the<00:02:48.130> the<00:02:48.790> deltoid

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
very important that the the deltoid

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.900 
very important that the the deltoid
muscles<00:02:49.620> is

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
muscles is

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.540 
muscles is
protection<00:02:52.390> here<00:02:52.570> so<00:02:52.960> those<00:02:53.740> are<00:02:53.890> all<00:02:54.370> the

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
protection here so those are all the

so and you know reality even though I've
measured<00:03:16.390> it<00:03:16.750> I<00:03:17.020> thought<00:03:17.350> this<00:03:17.470> might<00:03:17.620> be<00:03:17.680> a

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
measured it I thought this might be a

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.560 
measured it I thought this might be a
little<00:03:18.010> bit<00:03:18.270> big

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570

little bit big
now<00:03:20.020> that<00:03:20.200> it's<00:03:20.290> actually<00:03:20.410> on<00:03:20.680> them<00:03:20.860> it

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
now that it's actually on them it

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.650 
now that it's actually on them it
actually<00:03:21.280> looks<00:03:21.730> pretty<00:03:21.760> good<00:03:22.060> he's<00:03:22.420> good<00:03:22.570> to

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
actually looks pretty good he's good to

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.690 
actually looks pretty good he's good to
go
