this only because it's a metal pack and
much<00:04:31.560> the<00:04:31.680> only<00:04:31.800> difference<00:04:32.250> is<00:04:32.370> the<00:04:32.639> spine

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
much the only difference is the spine

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.150

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
here as you can see it's because it's

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.379 
here as you can see it's because it's
sarah<00:04:38.160> dump<00:04:38.460> their<00:04:38.639> top<00:04:38.940> you<00:04:39.090> can<00:04:39.180> see<00:04:39.270> the

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389 
sarah dump their top you can see the

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:41.390 
sarah dump their top you can see the
line<00:04:39.660> there<00:04:39.960> it's<00:04:40.380> nice<00:04:40.590> try<00:04:40.860> pour<00:04:41.070> it<00:04:41.160> in<00:04:41.310> the

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
line there it's nice try pour it in the

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.000 
line there it's nice try pour it in the
middle<00:04:41.669> so<00:04:41.729> it's<00:04:41.850> a<00:04:41.910> bit<00:04:42.030> a<00:04:42.060> little<00:04:42.150> bit<00:04:42.330> lower

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
middle so it's a bit a little bit lower

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.850 
middle so it's a bit a little bit lower
but<00:04:44.010> um<00:04:44.280> it's<00:04:44.880> the<00:04:45.090> g2<00:04:45.510> size<00:04:45.810> so<00:04:46.410> it's<00:04:46.590> a<00:04:46.680> blu

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
but um it's the g2 size so it's a blu

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.420 
but um it's the g2 size so it's a blu
ray<00:04:46.889> sighs<00:04:47.310> and<00:04:47.990> I<00:04:48.990> heard<00:04:49.650> the<00:04:49.830> movies<00:04:50.190> great

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
ray sighs and I heard the movies great

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.760 
ray sighs and I heard the movies great
so<00:04:51.090> in<00:04:51.240> my<00:04:51.479> opinion<00:04:51.630> it's<00:04:52.080> definitely<00:04:52.560> worth

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
so in my opinion it's definitely worth

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.280 
so in my opinion it's definitely worth
it<00:04:53.010> if<00:04:53.880> you<00:04:54.030> can<00:04:54.180> look<00:04:54.270> past<00:04:54.330> the<00:04:54.780> part<00:04:55.080> that

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
it if you can look past the part that

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.150 
it if you can look past the part that
it's<00:04:55.410> metal<00:04:55.710> pack<00:04:56.300> I<00:04:57.800> think<00:04:58.800> it's<00:04:58.950> definitely

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
it's metal pack I think it's definitely

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.620
