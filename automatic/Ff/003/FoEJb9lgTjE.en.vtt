00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:43.249 

here<00:01:33.810> we<00:01:33.899> go<00:01:37.609> all<00:01:38.609> right<00:01:38.909> guard<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:41.509> and<00:01:42.509> fold

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
here we go all right guard that and fold

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:53.029 
here we go all right guard that and fold
it<00:01:43.380> over<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:44.100> other<00:01:44.130> way<00:01:50.299> this<00:01:51.299> is<00:01:51.539> exact<00:01:52.259> bit

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:53.039 
it over the other way this is exact bit

it's<00:02:02.579> it<00:02:03.420> looks<00:02:03.780> like<00:02:04.140> I'm<00:02:04.380> making<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.979> same

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
it's it looks like I'm making the same

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:17.059 
it's it looks like I'm making the same
thing<00:02:05.489> but<00:02:06.119> I'm<00:02:06.270> not<00:02:13.790> and<00:02:14.790> then<00:02:14.940> just<00:02:15.860> fold<00:02:16.860> it

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
thing but I'm not and then just fold it

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.059 
thing but I'm not and then just fold it
over<00:02:17.250> like<00:02:17.640> that<00:02:18.410> I'm<00:02:19.410> doing<00:02:19.650> this<00:02:19.769> very

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
roughly so take your time pause if you

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:37.660 
roughly so take your time pause if you
need<00:02:23.370> to

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.550

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.230 

and<00:04:37.070> then<00:04:37.460> use<00:04:37.640> floppy<00:04:38.120> bits

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
and then use floppy bits

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:59.870 
and then use floppy bits
just<00:04:40.930> fold<00:04:41.530> them<00:04:41.650> over<00:04:41.889> like<00:04:42.490> that

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:10.060 

I<00:04:59.940> did<00:05:00.780> on<00:05:00.930> the<00:05:01.050> other<00:05:01.080> side

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:15.439 

Oh

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:15.449 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:18.890 

alright<00:05:16.139> and<00:05:16.439> then<00:05:16.860> these<00:05:17.069> flaps<00:05:17.550> here<00:05:17.909> take

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
alright and then these flaps here take

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.709 
alright and then these flaps here take
them<00:05:19.199> out<00:05:19.490> all<00:05:20.490> right<00:05:20.759> and<00:05:20.969> then<00:05:21.210> this<00:05:21.389> bits

00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:21.719 
them out all right and then this bits

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:25.249 
them out all right and then this bits
tricky<00:05:22.319> if<00:05:22.620> you<00:05:22.830> open<00:05:23.400> this<00:05:23.430> bit<00:05:23.789> you<00:05:24.719> can<00:05:24.930> see

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:25.259 
tricky if you open this bit you can see

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:28.670 
tricky if you open this bit you can see
that<00:05:25.939> there's<00:05:26.939> a<00:05:27.089> little<00:05:27.270> flat<00:05:27.659> there<00:05:27.960> so<00:05:28.620> you

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
that there's a little flat there so you

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:35.290 
that there's a little flat there so you
fold<00:05:29.189> this<00:05:31.520> inside<00:05:32.809> there<00:05:33.809> this<00:05:34.289> bits<00:05:34.559> little

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
fold this inside there this bits little

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.940 
fold this inside there this bits little
you<00:05:36.300> see<00:05:36.539> what<00:05:36.659> I've<00:05:36.779> done

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:44.690 

if<00:05:39.160> folded<00:05:39.760> up<00:05:39.970> piece<00:05:40.240> in<00:05:40.540> there

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:44.700 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:57.500 

yes<00:05:45.360> that's<00:05:45.750> what<00:05:45.900> you<00:05:45.960> did

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:57.510 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:16.850 

I<00:05:57.630> do<00:05:57.930> that<00:05:58.440> on<00:05:59.130> the<00:05:59.280> other<00:05:59.370> side

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:23.159 

there<00:06:17.750> now<00:06:19.639> if<00:06:20.639> you<00:06:20.819> find<00:06:21.180> the<00:06:21.389> point

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:23.169 
there now if you find the point

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:26.159 
there now if you find the point
that<00:06:23.770> has<00:06:24.069> a<00:06:24.430> little<00:06:24.610> hole<00:06:24.969> if<00:06:25.419> you<00:06:25.870> I<00:06:25.960> that

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:34.599 
into this side you get it and if it's if

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:35.879 
into this side you get it and if it's if
