00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
watching her video I saw that she

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.180 
watching her video I saw that she
bleached<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.969> closure<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.620> are<00:00:55.620> not<00:00:55.949> allowed

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
bleached the closure you are not allowed

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.680 
bleached the closure you are not allowed
to<00:00:56.219> bleach<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.730> closer<00:00:56.940> like<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.300> tells<00:00:57.570> you

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
to bleach the closer like it tells you

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.060 
to bleach the closer like it tells you
that<00:00:57.809> on<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:57.960> website<00:00:58.109> do<00:00:58.500> not<00:00:58.710> bleach<00:00:58.920> this

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
that on the website do not bleach this

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.369 
that on the website do not bleach this
closure<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.699> is<00:00:59.820> not<00:01:00.000> version<00:01:00.539> here<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.350> I

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
closure it is not version here so I

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.349 
closure it is not version here so I
guess<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:02.010> why<00:01:02.190> her<00:01:02.489> closure<00:01:02.760> was<00:01:03.090> messed

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
guess that is why her closure was messed

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.509 
guess that is why her closure was messed

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:32.969 
using elastic just time I white i

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:34.550
