really<00:03:49.380> sure<00:03:49.560> what<00:03:50.190> that<00:03:50.220> does<00:03:50.580> and<00:03:50.850> then<00:03:51.510> your

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
really sure what that does and then your

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.800 
really sure what that does and then your
fuel<00:03:52.020> and<00:03:52.820> then<00:03:53.820> you<00:03:54.000> just<00:03:54.240> drive<00:03:54.630> around

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
fuel and then you just drive around

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:04.310 
fuel and then you just drive around
cutting<00:03:55.709> down<00:03:55.980> all<00:03:56.010> this<00:03:56.370> grass<00:04:00.860> yeah<00:04:03.320> it

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
cutting down all this grass yeah it

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:14.059 
cutting down all this grass yeah it
doesn't<00:04:04.650> cut<00:04:04.950> down<00:04:05.160> flowers

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:18.860 

but<00:04:14.909> it<00:04:15.030> does<00:04:15.919> take<00:04:16.919> your<00:04:17.100> grass<00:04:17.750> running<00:04:18.750> out

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870

of<00:04:18.900> fuel<00:04:22.250> this<00:04:23.250> thing<00:04:23.490> is<00:04:23.610> extremely<00:04:24.120> hard<00:04:24.330> to

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
of fuel this thing is extremely hard to

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.120 
of fuel this thing is extremely hard to
drive<00:04:24.860> but<00:04:25.860> I'm<00:04:26.009> sure<00:04:26.250> some<00:04:26.880> fiddling<00:04:27.210> around

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
drive but I'm sure some fiddling around

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:43.030 
drive but I'm sure some fiddling around
you<00:04:29.130> guys<00:04:29.460> will<00:04:29.669> figure<00:04:29.820> it<00:04:30.030> out<00:04:33.349> so

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:51.280 

ah<00:04:43.420> ok<00:04:44.830> yeah<00:04:46.270> so<00:04:47.350> when<00:04:48.350> you<00:04:48.440> right<00:04:48.650> click<00:04:50.290> with

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
ah ok yeah so when you right click with

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.790 
ah ok yeah so when you right click with
nothing<00:04:51.680> in<00:04:51.770> your<00:04:51.890> hand<00:04:52.100> you<00:04:52.780> get<00:04:53.780> your<00:04:54.290> fuel

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800

in<00:04:54.950> your<00:04:55.100> cargo<00:04:55.460> so<00:04:55.700> it<00:04:55.790> collected<00:04:56.120> a<00:04:56.180> bunch<00:04:56.300> of

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
in your cargo so it collected a bunch of

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.110 
in your cargo so it collected a bunch of
seeds<00:04:56.660> for<00:04:56.900> you<00:04:56.990> so<00:04:57.380> that's<00:04:58.340> very<00:04:58.460> handy<00:04:59.060> if
