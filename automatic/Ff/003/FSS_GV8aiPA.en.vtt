than<00:03:40.299> six<00:03:40.780> but<00:03:41.049> even<00:03:41.290> six<00:03:41.650> is<00:03:41.890> pushing<00:03:42.280> it

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
than six but even six is pushing it

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.190 
than six but even six is pushing it
because<00:03:42.640> everybody<00:03:43.030> is<00:03:43.150> drawing<00:03:43.540> a<00:03:43.629> card<00:03:43.900> and

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
because everybody is drawing a card and

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.140 
because everybody is drawing a card and
you're<00:03:44.680> looking<00:03:44.920> around<00:03:45.040> the<00:03:45.190> table<00:03:45.609> and<00:03:45.640> it's

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
you're looking around the table and it's

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.229 
you're looking around the table and it's
very<00:03:46.420> scarce<00:03:47.049> ones<00:03:47.410> are<00:03:47.650> really<00:03:48.280> powerful<00:03:48.519> the

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
very scarce ones are really powerful the

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.660 
very scarce ones are really powerful the
more<00:03:49.480> players<00:03:49.780> you<00:03:50.049> have<00:03:50.079> the<00:03:50.980> game<00:03:51.159> seems<00:03:51.519> to

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
more players you have the game seems to

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.759 
more players you have the game seems to
work<00:03:51.940> really<00:03:51.970> well<00:03:52.390> three<00:03:52.989> and<00:03:53.140> four<00:03:53.440> player

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
work really well three and four player

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.250 
work really well three and four player
and<00:03:54.209> essentially<00:03:55.209> it<00:03:55.390> is<00:03:55.450> one<00:03:55.659> of<00:03:55.750> the<00:03:55.810> memory

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
and essentially it is one of the memory

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.619 
and essentially it is one of the memory
