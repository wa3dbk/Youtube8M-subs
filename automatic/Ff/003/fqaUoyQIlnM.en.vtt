00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.410
 hello the solid and pretty grammatico 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.480
 creator and founding founder of the 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.400
 truck company today I 'm going to you 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.710
 explain how to check crimping 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.920
 of your stones on the jewel way to 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.230
 to go lose or how all of why from 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.789
 from time to time we risk losing his 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.519
 stones simply because the 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.519
 cases are crimped with gold that crushes 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.550
 and are the stones when this gold is 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.969
 worn with the friction of everyday life we ​​have 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.590
 less gold on the stone and we risk if 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.120
 it does not verify losing pianos 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.969
 what to do 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.800
 simply in home prevention so 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.100
 after cleaning up her jewels we 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.539
 usually done three times a year 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.190
 to bring a small tweezers is 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.379
 just in prevention we're going 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.770
 tapping on the ring is difficult 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.170
 it does not move or it's your bread 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.910
 do not hesitate not flat tapping on 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.730
 saw that at a stone that fell 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.949
 could have possibly seen it in 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.619
 passing the small clip on the stones 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.290
 here are the stones not moving a priori the 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.820
 hip checking but d 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.880
 others seem to hold 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.280
 so what's going on here is this 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.320
 we see there we have a wear and tear we see 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.000
 that there is a small lack of gold jean has 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.590
 no choice but to go see her 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.500
 jeweler is a little restoration 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.740
 the jeweler will resume the release on 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.930
 add a little bit of built-in ray doors 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.070
 the stone bring them out simply 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.509
 so there are signs that do not deceive 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.049
 not like you could see on this 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.020
 step 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.119
 but as a rule we have heard 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.500
 often a little rattling before so he 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.750
 be careful of you hear 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.130
 a little clatter is that there is a 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.210
 little bit of play on a rock and that he 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.619
 it's time to see your bound joy 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.200
 to do a little restoration 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.100
 an exit check here you 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.090
 know now when your 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.090
 crimping excused
