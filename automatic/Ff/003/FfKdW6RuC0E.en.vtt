west coast and East Coast but that

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.139 
west coast and East Coast but that
really<00:00:53.010> begs<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.489> question<00:00:53.850> since<00:00:54.000> they're

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
really begs the question since they're

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.000 
really begs the question since they're
so<00:00:54.300> concentrated<00:00:54.899> should<00:00:55.410> we<00:00:55.530> split<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:55.920> up

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
so concentrated should we split it up

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.560 
so concentrated should we split it up
and<00:00:56.160> take<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.370> somewhere<00:00:56.550> else<00:00:56.730> so<00:00:57.329> there's<00:00:57.480> a

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
and take it somewhere else so there's a

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.119

well Asia might work but the Fallout
series<00:01:09.780> really<00:01:10.260> consists<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.860> massively

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.820

Western<00:01:11.880> ideas<00:01:12.270> music<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.840> other<00:01:12.930> ideas<00:01:13.140> so

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
I'm thinking it's either North America

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.969 
I'm thinking it's either North America
or<00:01:15.659> Europe<00:01:15.810> now<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.350> being<00:01:16.530> said<00:01:16.619> my

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.590 
or Europe now that being said my
favorite<00:01:17.310> part<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.759> Fallout<00:01:18.090> game<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.479> the

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
favorite part of the Fallout game is the

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.270 
favorite part of the Fallout game is the
satire<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.110> it<00:01:19.350> plays<00:01:19.530> on<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.890> American

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
satire that it plays on the American

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.580 
satire that it plays on the American
Dream<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.850> just<00:01:21.240> don't<00:01:21.420> think<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.930> game<00:01:22.200> would

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
Dream I just don't think the game would

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.469 
Dream I just don't think the game would
be<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.920> same<00:01:23.159> without<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:23.880> I'm<00:01:24.000> thinking

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
be the same without it so I'm thinking

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.510 
be the same without it so I'm thinking
in<00:01:24.630> this<00:01:25.110> case<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:25.680> my<00:01:25.770> personal<00:01:26.130> opinion

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
in this case and in my personal opinion

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.249 
in this case and in my personal opinion
I<00:01:26.670> believe<00:01:26.939> it's<00:01:27.390> gonna<00:01:27.540> have<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.840> stay<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.200> the

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
I believe it's gonna have to stay in the

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.929 
I believe it's gonna have to stay in the
United<00:01:28.380> States<00:01:28.799> London<00:01:29.400> would<00:01:29.549> be<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.729> nice

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
United States London would be a nice

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.249 
United States London would be a nice
place<00:01:30.240> but<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.479> don't<00:01:30.659> think<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:30.900> could<00:01:31.049> handle

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
place but I don't think I could handle

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.530 
place but I don't think I could handle
entire<00:01:31.740> game<00:01:32.009> full<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.280> walls<00:01:32.579> with<00:01:32.790> robots<00:01:33.180> so

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
entire game full of walls with robots so

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.359 
entire game full of walls with robots so
America<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.170> is<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.500> I'm<00:01:34.650> narrowed<00:01:34.920> down<00:01:34.950> five

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
America it is so I'm narrowed down five

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.740 
America it is so I'm narrowed down five
choices<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.119> think<00:01:36.360> might<00:01:36.600> be<00:01:36.630> a

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
choices that I think might be a

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.300 
choices that I think might be a
possibility<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.500> where<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.740> next<00:01:37.950> game<00:01:38.100> can

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
possibility of where the next game can

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.719 
possibility of where the next game can
take<00:01:38.340> place

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
take place

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.700 
take place
so<00:01:39.060> first<00:01:39.299> up<00:01:39.479> on<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.630> list<00:01:39.840> is<00:01:40.020> Boston<00:01:40.470> one<00:01:40.619> of

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
so first up on the list is Boston one of

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.200 
so first up on the list is Boston one of
the<00:01:40.770> most<00:01:40.920> American<00:01:41.400> cities<00:01:41.670> there<00:01:41.850> are<00:01:41.880> now

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
the most American cities there are now

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.520 
the most American cities there are now
at<00:01:42.329> this<00:01:42.450> point<00:01:42.720> in<00:01:42.780> time<00:01:42.930> there<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.259> lot<00:01:43.439> of

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
at this point in time there is a lot of

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.080 
at this point in time there is a lot of
evidence<00:01:43.770> for<00:01:44.100> Boston<00:01:44.549> being<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.820> side<00:01:45.000> of

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
evidence for Boston being the side of

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.719 
evidence for Boston being the side of
the<00:01:45.149> next<00:01:45.329> game<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.840> survivor<00:01:46.280> 2299<00:01:47.280> website

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
the next game the survivor 2299 website

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.310 
the next game the survivor 2299 website
that<00:01:47.909> might<00:01:48.060> be<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.240> teaser<00:01:48.540> might<00:01:48.869> be<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.079> hoax

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
that might be a teaser might be a hoax

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.719 
that might be a teaser might be a hoax
points<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.009> being<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.369> next<00:01:50.579> choice

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
points to it being the next choice

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.880 
points to it being the next choice
Boston<00:01:51.479> does<00:01:51.689> fit<00:01:51.930> well<00:01:52.079> into<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.439> storyline

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
Boston does fit well into the storyline

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.770 
Boston does fit well into the storyline
it's<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.100> very<00:01:53.340> patriotic<00:01:53.970> city<00:01:54.299> there's<00:01:54.509> tons

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
it's a very patriotic city there's tons

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
of history there and it might be a

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.100 
of history there and it might be a
pretty<00:01:56.549> good<00:01:56.670> choice<00:01:56.820> since<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.630> East<00:01:57.810> Coast

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
pretty good choice since the East Coast

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.749 
pretty good choice since the East Coast
is<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:58.409> compacted<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.040> make<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.310> possible<00:01:59.460> to

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
is so compacted to make it possible to

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.310 
is so compacted to make it possible to
have<00:01:59.880> multiple<00:02:00.030> states<00:02:00.600> in<00:02:00.750> this<00:02:00.869> one<00:02:01.079> area

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
have multiple states in this one area

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.810 
have multiple states in this one area
which<00:02:01.770> will<00:02:01.950> allow<00:02:02.100> for<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.369> lot<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.579> diversity

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
which will allow for a lot of diversity

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
drawing up concept maps of what

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.080 
drawing up concept maps of what
game<00:02:05.920> could<00:02:06.130> look<00:02:06.250> like<00:02:06.310> and<00:02:06.610> it<00:02:06.730> looks<00:02:06.910> like<00:02:06.970> a

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
game could look like and it looks like a

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.850 
game could look like and it looks like a
pretty<00:02:07.390> logical<00:02:07.900> choice<00:02:08.080> personally<00:02:08.740> though

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
pretty logical choice personally though

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:09.960 
pretty logical choice personally though
I'd<00:02:08.979> like<00:02:09.130> to<00:02:09.250> see<00:02:09.370> it<00:02:09.460> step<00:02:09.670> away<00:02:09.820> from

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
I'd like to see it step away from

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.580 
I'd like to see it step away from
Washington<00:02:10.300> DC<00:02:10.630> and<00:02:10.960> all<00:02:11.050> the<00:02:11.140> history<00:02:11.410> kind

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
to see it go in a completely different

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.930 
to see it go in a completely different
direction<00:02:14.530> so<00:02:15.070> that<00:02:15.220> brings<00:02:15.430> us<00:02:15.670> to<00:02:15.700> number

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
direction so that brings us to number

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.090 
direction so that brings us to number
two<00:02:16.330> Miami<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.320> whole<00:02:17.470> environment<00:02:17.770> would

two Miami the whole environment would

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.500 
two Miami the whole environment would
just<00:02:18.280> be<00:02:18.370> so<00:02:18.550> much<00:02:18.700> different<00:02:19.060> from<00:02:19.090> any<00:02:19.300> other

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510

city more about the wild more about the

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
survival now if we went this route it

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.670 
survival now if we went this route it
would<00:03:31.180> allow<00:03:31.390> for<00:03:31.600> multiple<00:03:31.780> towns<00:03:32.290> to<00:03:32.560> be

States but what if that walk across the

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.090 
States but what if that walk across the
map<00:05:26.270> took<00:05:26.479> an<00:05:26.630> hour<00:05:26.780> every<00:05:27.470> time<00:05:27.710> you<00:05:27.830> set<00:05:28.070> out

map took an hour every time you set out
you<00:05:28.370> could<00:05:28.490> see<00:05:28.700> something<00:05:28.970> new<00:05:29.300> you<00:05:29.450> could<00:05:29.540> go

you could see something new you could go

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.330 
you could see something new you could go
in<00:05:29.840> a<00:05:29.900> different<00:05:30.050> direction<00:05:30.260> find<00:05:30.950> someone

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
new do another quest it'd really be

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:34.750 
new do another quest it'd really be
pretty<00:05:33.680> interesting<00:05:34.280> when<00:05:34.400> you<00:05:34.490> think<00:05:34.669> about

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
pretty interesting when you think about

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.430 
pretty interesting when you think about
it<00:05:35.030> now<00:05:35.210> fast<00:05:35.479> travel<00:05:35.870> would<00:05:35.960> have<00:05:36.169> to<00:05:36.320> be<00:05:36.410> a

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
it now fast travel would have to be a

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.990 
it now fast travel would have to be a
must<00:05:36.740> but<00:05:36.890> with<00:05:37.039> the<00:05:37.130> time<00:05:37.400> period<00:05:37.700> that<00:05:37.970> I

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
must but with the time period that I

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.390 
must but with the time period that I
have<00:05:38.270> it<00:05:38.450> in<00:05:38.539> after<00:05:39.050> fallout<00:05:39.380> 3<00:05:39.740> you<00:05:40.160> know<00:05:40.280> the

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
have it in after fallout 3 you know the

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.159 
have it in after fallout 3 you know the
vertibirds<00:05:40.850> and<00:05:41.180> whatnot<00:05:41.450> that<00:05:41.870> would<00:05:41.990> make

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:42.169 
vertibirds and whatnot that would make

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:43.960 
vertibirds and whatnot that would make
it<00:05:42.320> for<00:05:42.590> you<00:05:42.770> be<00:05:42.950> able<00:05:43.130> to<00:05:43.190> travel<00:05:43.490> pretty<00:05:43.610> fast

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:43.970 
it for you be able to travel pretty fast

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:45.969 
it for you be able to travel pretty fast
like<00:05:44.419> I<00:05:44.570> said<00:05:44.780> in<00:05:44.900> my<00:05:44.930> opinion<00:05:45.140> fall<00:05:45.710> it's<00:05:45.860> the

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:45.979 
like I said in my opinion fall it's the

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:47.800 
like I said in my opinion fall it's the
best<00:05:46.250> open-world<00:05:46.729> game<00:05:47.060> and<00:05:47.240> I<00:05:47.300> think<00:05:47.539> if<00:05:47.630> I

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
best open-world game and I think if I

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.600 
best open-world game and I think if I
did<00:05:47.990> this<00:05:48.169> if<00:05:48.380> they<00:05:48.530> just<00:05:48.710> made<00:05:48.860> this<00:05:49.039> massive

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
did this if they just made this massive

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.279 
did this if they just made this massive
world<00:05:49.820> full<00:05:50.120> of<00:05:50.270> things<00:05:50.450> that<00:05:50.690> do<00:05:50.810> and<00:05:51.020> full<00:05:51.200> of

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:51.289 
world full of things that do and full of

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:53.140 
world full of things that do and full of
things<00:05:51.440> to<00:05:51.620> see<00:05:51.800> I<00:05:52.039> think<00:05:52.310> it<00:05:52.640> really<00:05:52.880> put<00:05:53.060> it

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
things to see I think it really put it

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.270 
things to see I think it really put it
over<00:05:53.300> the<00:05:53.479> top<00:05:53.690> in<00:05:53.930> a<00:05:54.050> few<00:05:54.260> months<00:05:54.650> weeks<00:05:54.890> or<00:05:55.190> at

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
over the top in a few months weeks or at

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.980 
over the top in a few months weeks or at
the<00:05:55.370> rate<00:05:55.520> it's<00:05:55.640> been<00:05:55.760> going<00:05:55.970> lately<00:05:56.150> days<00:05:56.600> we

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:56.990 
the rate it's been going lately days we

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.540 
the rate it's been going lately days we
