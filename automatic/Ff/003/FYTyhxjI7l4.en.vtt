00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:12.890 
have something called a Tesla tower now

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:14.560 
have something called a Tesla tower now
this<00:00:13.100> is<00:00:13.220> actually<00:00:13.610> one<00:00:13.940> of<00:00:13.970> the<00:00:14.120> new<00:00:14.240> blocks

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
this is actually one of the new blocks

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.179 
this is actually one of the new blocks
that<00:00:15.019> came<00:00:15.200> out<00:00:15.380> it's<00:00:15.590> is<00:00:15.710> the<00:00:15.830> Lightning

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:16.189 
that came out it's is the Lightning

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:18.640 
that came out it's is the Lightning
block<00:00:16.430> and<00:00:16.640> I've<00:00:17.539> just<00:00:17.749> renamed<00:00:18.169> it

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
block and I've just renamed it

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.460 
block and I've just renamed it
Tesla<00:00:19.189> tower<00:00:19.400> so<00:00:19.820> the<00:00:20.269> moment<00:00:20.599> I<00:00:20.689> drop<00:00:21.199> this

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
Tesla tower so the moment I drop this

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.560 
Tesla tower so the moment I drop this
block<00:00:21.800> okay<00:00:22.339> you'll<00:00:22.909> see<00:00:23.150> that<00:00:23.269> it<00:00:23.390> actually

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
block okay you'll see that it actually

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.399 
block okay you'll see that it actually
spawns<00:00:24.230> a<00:00:24.499> tower<00:00:24.859> where<00:00:25.699> I<00:00:25.909> the<00:00:26.749> block<00:00:26.989> was<00:00:27.230> so

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:27.409 
spawns a tower where I the block was so

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:29.380 
spawns a tower where I the block was so
if<00:00:27.499> I<00:00:27.589> drop<00:00:28.220> one<00:00:28.369> over<00:00:28.579> here<00:00:28.849> you'll<00:00:29.060> see<00:00:29.239> there

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
if I drop one over here you'll see there

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.329 
if I drop one over here you'll see there
we<00:00:29.480> go<00:00:29.720> I<00:00:30.079> just<00:00:30.739> need<00:00:30.829> to<00:00:30.919> move<00:00:31.009> away<00:00:31.159> because

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
command for the Tesla tower a block so

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.050 
command for the Tesla tower a block so
you'll<00:01:09.260> see<00:01:09.440> it's<00:01:09.560> a<00:01:09.590> sea<00:01:09.830> lantern<00:01:10.280> I'm<00:01:10.430> giving

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
when I actually drop this Tesla tower

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.770 
when I actually drop this Tesla tower
this<00:01:24.020> block<00:01:24.380> again<00:01:25.159> this<00:01:25.940> block<00:01:26.270> will<00:01:26.479> be<00:01:26.510> get

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
this block again this block will be get

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.940 
this block again this block will be get
one<00:01:27.080> added<00:01:27.590> to<00:01:27.920> the<00:01:28.040> tower<00:01:28.340> score<00:01:28.880> every<00:01:29.330> tick

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
one added to the tower score every tick

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.320 
one added to the tower score every tick
right<00:01:30.950> so<00:01:31.220> tick<00:01:31.640> tick<00:01:31.790> tick<00:01:31.909> tick<00:01:32.060> tick<00:01:32.180> one

one second ok that block will then

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.280 
one second ok that block will then
execute<00:01:39.950> a<00:01:40.280> clone<00:01:40.790> command<00:01:41.330> which<00:01:41.960> will<00:01:42.140> then

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.670 
know one so if we actually how can I
explain<00:01:58.460> it<00:01:58.549> so<00:01:58.760> let's<00:01:58.939> just<00:01:59.000> do<00:01:59.540> this<00:01:59.750> it

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
explain it so let's just do this it

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.320 
explain it so let's just do this it
might<00:02:00.830> be<00:02:00.890> good<00:02:01.130> idea<00:02:01.250> so<00:02:01.820> if<00:02:01.909> I<00:02:01.970> drop<00:02:02.180> the

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
might be good idea so if I drop the

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.410 
might be good idea so if I drop the
block<00:02:02.510> down<00:02:02.659> over<00:02:02.930> here<00:02:03.880> okay<00:02:04.880> you'll<00:02:05.210> see

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
block down over here okay you'll see

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.450 
block down over here okay you'll see
that<00:02:05.570> there<00:02:05.869> we<00:02:05.960> go<00:02:06.080> it<00:02:06.260> cloned<00:02:06.680> that<00:02:07.250> whole

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
that there we go it cloned that whole

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.240 
that there we go it cloned that whole
area<00:02:07.880> it<00:02:08.060> cloned<00:02:08.390> to<00:02:08.599> underneath<00:02:09.259> it<00:02:09.410> ok<00:02:10.130> this

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
area it cloned to underneath it ok this

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.530 
area it cloned to underneath it ok this
is<00:02:10.340> actually<00:02:10.610> very<00:02:10.640> good<00:02:10.849> because<00:02:11.000> then<00:02:11.300> I<00:02:11.360> can

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
is actually very good because then I can

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.570 
is actually very good because then I can
show<00:02:11.750> you<00:02:11.810> guys<00:02:12.050> the<00:02:12.620> inner<00:02:12.830> mimic<00:02:13.130> annex<00:02:13.430> have

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
show you guys the inner mimic annex have

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.880 
show you guys the inner mimic annex have
this<00:02:14.090> particular

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
this particular

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.960 
this particular
okay<00:02:15.550> so<00:02:15.610> here's<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.540> naked<00:02:16.960> bear

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
okay so here's the the naked bear

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.300 
okay so here's the the naked bear
contraption<00:02:18.970> so<00:02:19.500> basically<00:02:20.500> it's<00:02:20.710> this<00:02:21.130> is

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
contraption so basically it's this is

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.880 
contraption so basically it's this is
exactly<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:21.880> same<00:02:22.030> as<00:02:22.270> what's<00:02:22.570> over<00:02:22.870> here<00:02:23.110> but

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
exactly the same as what's over here but

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.110 
exactly the same as what's over here but
I've<00:02:23.980> just<00:02:24.010> made<00:02:24.310> this<00:02:24.430> few<00:02:24.880> modifications

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
I've just made this few modifications

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.150 
I've just made this few modifications
just<00:02:25.540> that<00:02:25.780> I<00:02:25.810> can<00:02:25.960> explain<00:02:26.350> to<00:02:26.410> explain<00:02:27.040> to

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
just that I can explain to explain to

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.910 
just that I can explain to explain to
you<00:02:27.220> guys<00:02:27.430> first<00:02:28.270> of<00:02:28.510> we<00:02:29.200> need<00:02:29.440> to<00:02:29.560> just<00:02:29.710> take

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
you guys first of we need to just take

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.540 
you guys first of we need to just take
note<00:02:30.190> of<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:31.840> actual<00:02:32.350> frame<00:02:32.770> animation<00:02:33.430> so

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
note of the actual frame animation so

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.280 
note of the actual frame animation so
I'm<00:02:33.670> actually<00:02:34.000> animating<00:02:34.600> the<00:02:35.080> little

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
I'm actually animating the little

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.420 
I'm actually animating the little
popping<00:02:35.650> up<00:02:35.770> and<00:02:35.950> popping<00:02:36.550> down<00:02:36.700> using<00:02:37.510> these

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
popping up and popping down using these

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.090 
popping up and popping down using these
five<00:02:39.750> what<00:02:40.750> blocks<00:02:41.170> over<00:02:41.440> you<00:02:41.590> or<00:02:41.680> these<00:02:41.860> five

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
five what blocks over you or these five

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.100 
five what blocks over you or these five
animation<00:02:42.910> frames<00:02:43.300> over<00:02:43.570> here<00:02:43.810> so<00:02:43.959> basically

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
animation frames over here so basically

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.199 
animation frames over here so basically
I'm<00:02:44.350> just<00:02:44.380> cloning<00:02:44.800> cloning<00:02:45.250> cloning<00:02:45.760> cloning

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
I'm just cloning cloning cloning cloning

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.150 
I'm just cloning cloning cloning cloning
cloning<00:02:46.660> and<00:02:47.170> then<00:02:47.260> cloning<00:02:47.709> cloning<00:02:47.800> cloning

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
cloning and then cloning cloning cloning

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.530 
cloning and then cloning cloning cloning
cloning<00:02:48.490> right<00:02:50.520> the<00:02:51.520> tower<00:02:51.730> pops<00:02:52.030> up<00:02:52.209> because

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
cloning right the tower pops up because

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.560 
cloning right the tower pops up because
I'm<00:02:52.959> running<00:02:53.920> a<00:02:54.040> test<00:02:54.310> for<00:02:54.670> player<00:02:55.090> in<00:02:55.390> a

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
I'm running a test for player in a

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.780 
I'm running a test for player in a
certain<00:02:55.900> radius<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:56.739> tower<00:02:57.010> by<00:02:57.220> default<00:02:57.640> is

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
certain radius the tower by default is

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.110 
certain radius the tower by default is
set<00:02:57.970> to<00:02:58.030> 15<00:02:59.020> but<00:02:59.770> just<00:03:00.130> for<00:03:00.280> this<00:03:00.370> explore<00:03:00.730> for

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
set to 15 but just for this explore for

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.390 
set to 15 but just for this explore for
this<00:03:01.239> demonstration<00:03:01.660> I've<00:03:02.260> changed<00:03:02.680> it<00:03:02.890> to

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
this demonstration I've changed it to

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.340 
this demonstration I've changed it to
radius<00:03:04.090> five<00:03:04.480> just<00:03:04.840> so<00:03:04.900> that<00:03:05.020> I<00:03:05.050> can<00:03:05.140> be

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
radius five just so that I can be

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.800 
radius five just so that I can be
clicked<00:03:05.739> closer<00:03:06.060> before<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.330> text<00:03:07.600> me<00:03:07.660> so<00:03:07.780> I

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
clicked closer before the text me so I

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.240 
clicked closer before the text me so I
can<00:03:07.989> show<00:03:08.170> you<00:03:08.230> guys<00:03:08.290> what's<00:03:08.709> actually<00:03:08.920> going

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
can show you guys what's actually going

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.600 
can show you guys what's actually going
on<00:03:09.600> okay<00:03:10.600> now<00:03:10.750> I<00:03:10.930> know<00:03:11.200> I<00:03:11.470> don't<00:03:12.130> normally<00:03:12.340> do

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
on okay now I know I don't normally do

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.520 
on okay now I know I don't normally do
test<00:03:12.850> fours<00:03:13.150> but<00:03:13.420> in<00:03:13.660> this<00:03:13.810> case<00:03:14.020> I<00:03:14.230> made<00:03:14.440> an

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
test fours but in this case I made an

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:15.870 
test fours but in this case I made an
exception<00:03:14.800> I<00:03:15.220> want<00:03:15.489> this<00:03:15.640> to<00:03:15.850> be

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
exception I want this to be

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.270 
exception I want this to be
self-contained<00:03:16.720> I<00:03:16.989> didn't<00:03:17.920> want<00:03:18.070> to<00:03:18.160> actually

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
self-contained I didn't want to actually

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.460 
self-contained I didn't want to actually
make<00:03:18.489> some<00:03:18.760> complicated<00:03:19.630> thing<00:03:19.900> over<00:03:20.290> there

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
make some complicated thing over there

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.050 
make some complicated thing over there
that's<00:03:21.010> going<00:03:21.190> to<00:03:21.250> be<00:03:21.310> difficult<00:03:21.730> to<00:03:21.760> explain

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
that's going to be difficult to explain

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.699 
that's going to be difficult to explain
to<00:03:22.180> you<00:03:22.239> guys<00:03:22.390> I<00:03:22.600> mean<00:03:22.630> this<00:03:22.959> should<00:03:23.320> be<00:03:23.380> very

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
to you guys I mean this should be very

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.440 
to you guys I mean this should be very
very<00:03:24.010> straightforward<00:03:24.250> to<00:03:24.580> explain<00:03:24.880> so<00:03:25.360> the

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
very straightforward to explain so the

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.640 
very straightforward to explain so the
first<00:03:25.630> thing<00:03:25.780> we're<00:03:25.870> going<00:03:25.959> to<00:03:26.019> look<00:03:26.200> at<00:03:26.410> is

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
first thing we're going to look at is

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:27.570 
first thing we're going to look at is
when<00:03:26.890> I<00:03:26.920> come<00:03:27.160> closer

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
when I come closer

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.420 
when I come closer
it<00:03:28.570> takes<00:03:29.019> me<00:03:29.260> and<00:03:29.410> then<00:03:29.500> it<00:03:29.590> puts<00:03:30.070> a<00:03:30.130> signal

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
it takes me and then it puts a signal

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.910 
it takes me and then it puts a signal
through<00:03:30.549> this<00:03:30.900> comparator<00:03:31.900> the<00:03:32.470> first<00:03:32.739> thing

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
through this comparator the first thing

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.890 
through this comparator the first thing
it<00:03:33.010> does<00:03:33.040> it<00:03:33.400> sets<00:03:33.670> a<00:03:33.850> beacon<00:03:34.299> block<00:03:34.540> right

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
it does it sets a beacon block right

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.560 
it does it sets a beacon block right
over<00:03:35.230> there<00:03:35.380> so<00:03:35.500> if<00:03:35.560> I<00:03:35.620> just<00:03:35.769> go<00:03:35.890> away<00:03:36.010> if<00:03:36.570> when

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
over there so if I just go away if when

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.180 
over there so if I just go away if when
I<00:03:37.600> come<00:03:37.780> closer<00:03:38.019> you'll<00:03:38.350> see<00:03:38.410> it's<00:03:38.709> it's<00:03:38.980> the

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
I come closer you'll see it's it's the

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.830 
I come closer you'll see it's it's the
first<00:03:39.430> thing<00:03:39.610> that<00:03:39.730> happens<00:03:40.000> is<00:03:40.150> it<00:03:40.360> sets<00:03:40.660> a

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
first thing that happens is it sets a

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.710 
first thing that happens is it sets a
beacon<00:03:41.049> block<00:03:41.820> again<00:03:42.820> command<00:03:43.150> set<00:03:43.360> to<00:03:43.480> be<00:03:43.600> up

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
beacon block again command set to be up

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.210 
beacon block again command set to be up
there<00:03:43.840> we<00:03:43.930> go<00:03:44.049> that<00:03:44.440> was<00:03:44.470> very<00:03:44.799> quick<00:03:44.950> this

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
there we go that was very quick this

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.520 
there we go that was very quick this
it's<00:03:45.820> just<00:03:46.380> yeah

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
it's just yeah

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.340 
it's just yeah
it<00:03:47.620> sets<00:03:47.860> the<00:03:47.980> beacon<00:03:48.220> block<00:03:48.870> then<00:03:49.870> the<00:03:49.900> next

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
it sets the beacon block then the next

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.259 
it sets the beacon block then the next
thing<00:03:50.470> it<00:03:50.620> does<00:03:50.799> it<00:03:51.010> copies<00:03:51.580> the<00:03:51.730> first<00:03:51.760> frame

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
thing it does it copies the first frame

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.180 
thing it does it copies the first frame
idea<00:03:52.600> of<00:03:52.780> the<00:03:52.959> animation<00:03:53.380> and<00:03:53.530> clones<00:03:53.799> it<00:03:53.950> over

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
idea of the animation and clones it over

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.570 
idea of the animation and clones it over
here<00:03:54.400> then<00:03:55.209> it<00:03:55.330> copies<00:03:55.510> the<00:03:55.690> second<00:03:56.260> third<00:03:56.980> and

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
here then it copies the second third and

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.060 
here then it copies the second third and
fourth<00:03:58.299> okay<00:03:59.019> so<00:03:59.080> it<00:03:59.260> copies<00:03:59.709> the<00:03:59.739> four

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
fourth okay so it copies the four

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.430 
fourth okay so it copies the four
animation<00:04:00.670> frames<00:04:00.880> which<00:04:01.120> causes<00:04:01.690> that

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
animation frames which causes that

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.660 
animation frames which causes that
little<00:04:03.360> popping<00:04:04.360> up<00:04:04.540> of<00:04:04.810> the<00:04:05.350> tower<00:04:05.560> this<00:04:06.430> will

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
little popping up of the tower this will

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.370 
little popping up of the tower this will
cause<00:04:06.850> the<00:04:06.880> popping<00:04:07.360> up<00:04:07.510> of<00:04:07.690> the<00:04:07.870> tower<00:04:08.049> again

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
cause the popping up of the tower again

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.460 
cause the popping up of the tower again
is<00:04:08.709> the<00:04:08.920> bottom<00:04:09.370> row<00:04:09.580> over<00:04:10.030> here<00:04:10.269> the<00:04:11.200> last

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
is the bottom row over here the last

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.069 
is the bottom row over here the last
thing<00:04:11.829> it<00:04:11.950> does<00:04:12.209> it<00:04:13.209> actually<00:04:13.390> summons<00:04:13.959> an

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
thing it does it actually summons an

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:18.380 
thing it does it actually summons an
invisible<00:04:14.980> Guardian<00:04:16.200> called<00:04:17.200> a<00:04:17.440> Tesla<00:04:17.769> tower

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
invisible Guardian called a Tesla tower

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.740 
invisible Guardian called a Tesla tower
riding<00:04:19.390> a<00:04:20.160> with<00:04:21.160> a<00:04:21.190> skull<00:04:21.459> and<00:04:21.609> a<00:04:22.270> summons<00:04:22.630> are

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
riding a with a skull and a summons are

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.010 
riding a with a skull and a summons are
right<00:04:23.050> above<00:04:23.740> on<00:04:23.979> top<00:04:24.370> of<00:04:24.490> there<00:04:24.669> okay<00:04:25.210> so<00:04:25.270> this

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
right above on top of there okay so this

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.350 
right above on top of there okay so this
is<00:04:26.169> why<00:04:26.349> it's<00:04:26.680> not<00:04:27.130> actually<00:04:27.669> moving

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
is why it's not actually moving

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.640 
is why it's not actually moving
all<00:04:28.810> right<00:04:28.930> you<00:04:29.080> can<00:04:29.229> see<00:04:29.349> it's<00:04:29.530> actually

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
all right you can see it's actually

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.710 
all right you can see it's actually
stuck<00:04:30.099> over<00:04:30.370> there<00:04:30.400> it's<00:04:30.849> not<00:04:31.060> hopping<00:04:31.449> or

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
stuck over there it's not hopping or

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.540 
stuck over there it's not hopping or
jumping<00:04:32.050> around<00:04:32.199> so<00:04:32.710> it's<00:04:32.830> actually<00:04:33.009> riding<00:04:33.340> a

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
jumping around so it's actually riding a

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.100 
jumping around so it's actually riding a
wither<00:04:33.759> skull<00:04:34.090> but<00:04:34.509> what<00:04:34.629> I've<00:04:34.720> done<00:04:34.840> is<00:04:34.990> I've

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
wither skull but what I've done is I've

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.689 
wither skull but what I've done is I've
actually<00:04:35.259> removed<00:04:35.800> the<00:04:35.919> invisibility<00:04:36.340> so

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:36.699 
actually removed the invisibility so

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:39.089 
actually removed the invisibility so
that<00:04:36.819> you<00:04:36.879> can<00:04:37.000> actually<00:04:37.150> see<00:04:37.449> the<00:04:38.099> Guardian

00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:39.099 
that you can actually see the Guardian

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:42.779 
that you can actually see the Guardian
right<00:04:39.819> so<00:04:40.030> that<00:04:40.210> that<00:04:40.449> is<00:04:40.659> the<00:04:41.139> bottom<00:04:41.800> row<00:04:42.219> now

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:42.789 
right so that that is the bottom row now

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:44.730 
right so that that is the bottom row now
because<00:04:43.449> I'm<00:04:43.689> powering<00:04:44.169> these<00:04:44.409> blocks

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
because I'm powering these blocks

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.490 
because I'm powering these blocks
directly<00:04:45.370> I<00:04:45.580> can<00:04:45.849> then<00:04:46.240> actually<00:04:46.629> invert<00:04:47.110> the

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
directly I can then actually invert the

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.379 
directly I can then actually invert the
signal<00:04:47.680> what<00:04:48.460> that<00:04:48.610> means<00:04:48.849> is<00:04:49.060> that<00:04:49.090> when<00:04:49.360> I

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
signal what that means is that when I

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:51.179 
signal what that means is that when I
power<00:04:49.719> this<00:04:49.900> block<00:04:50.199> this<00:04:50.500> redstone<00:04:50.860> torch

00:04:51.179 --> 00:04:51.189 
power this block this redstone torch

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:53.909 
power this block this redstone torch
will<00:04:51.400> turn<00:04:51.610> off<00:04:51.759> and<00:04:52.090> deep<00:04:52.479> power<00:04:52.810> the<00:04:53.590> command

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:53.919 
will turn off and deep power the command

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:57.330 
will turn off and deep power the command
block<00:04:54.099> over<00:04:54.400> here<00:04:54.900> okay<00:04:55.900> when<00:04:56.590> I<00:04:56.770> move<00:04:57.129> out<00:04:57.250> of

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
block over here okay when I move out of

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.480 
block over here okay when I move out of
range<00:04:57.550> it<00:04:58.210> turns<00:04:58.539> it<00:04:58.750> turns<00:04:59.590> off<00:04:59.770> the<00:04:59.830> power<00:05:00.400> to

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
range it turns it turns off the power to

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.390 
range it turns it turns off the power to
that<00:05:00.729> block<00:05:00.969> which<00:05:01.360> then<00:05:01.569> activates<00:05:02.259> the<00:05:03.159> row

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
that block which then activates the row

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.809 
that block which then activates the row
the<00:05:03.759> top<00:05:04.030> blocks<00:05:04.479> so<00:05:05.409> when<00:05:05.590> I'm<00:05:05.680> close<00:05:05.889> by<00:05:06.129> only

00:05:06.809 --> 00:05:06.819 
the top blocks so when I'm close by only

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:09.230 
the top blocks so when I'm close by only
the<00:05:07.090> bottom<00:05:07.389> blocks<00:05:07.629> are<00:05:07.810> activated<00:05:08.770> which

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
the bottom blocks are activated which

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.580 
the bottom blocks are activated which
generates<00:05:10.240> the<00:05:10.360> tower<00:05:10.539> and<00:05:10.870> spawns<00:05:11.379> that

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
generates the tower and spawns that

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.890 
generates the tower and spawns that
thing<00:05:11.770> when<00:05:12.159> I<00:05:12.190> move<00:05:12.400> away<00:05:12.550> the<00:05:13.210> top<00:05:13.509> blocks

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
thing when I move away the top blocks

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.249 
thing when I move away the top blocks
are<00:05:14.080> then<00:05:14.469> activated<00:05:14.680> in<00:05:15.190> the<00:05:15.340> same<00:05:15.639> sequence

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:16.259 
are then activated in the same sequence

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:18.779 
are then activated in the same sequence
so<00:05:17.259> first<00:05:17.530> off<00:05:17.740> first<00:05:18.039> thing<00:05:18.190> that<00:05:18.310> happens<00:05:18.580> is

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:18.789 
so first off first thing that happens is

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:21.719 
so first off first thing that happens is
I<00:05:18.969> kill<00:05:19.719> the<00:05:20.199> wither<00:05:20.409> skull<00:05:20.740> okay

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:21.729 
I kill the wither skull okay

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:23.659 
I kill the wither skull okay
second<00:05:22.300> thing<00:05:22.449> is<00:05:22.479> I<00:05:22.750> kill<00:05:22.990> the<00:05:23.139> Guardian

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:23.669 
second thing is I kill the Guardian

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:26.519 
second thing is I kill the Guardian
fourth<00:05:24.669> thing<00:05:24.879> is<00:05:25.029> I<00:05:25.180> kill<00:05:25.659> any<00:05:25.870> items<00:05:26.349> that

00:05:26.519 --> 00:05:26.529 
fourth thing is I kill any items that

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:31.430 
fourth thing is I kill any items that
drop<00:05:27.330> from<00:05:28.330> from<00:05:29.139> the<00:05:29.409> items<00:05:29.770> when<00:05:30.009> from<00:05:30.370> the

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
drop from from the items when from the

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.920 
drop from from the items when from the
from<00:05:32.440> the<00:05:32.590> Guardian<00:05:32.949> when<00:05:33.099> I<00:05:33.129> kill<00:05:33.370> it<00:05:33.400> and

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
from the Guardian when I kill it and

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:39.959 
from the Guardian when I kill it and
then<00:05:34.930> only<00:05:35.440> do<00:05:35.860> I<00:05:35.889> clone<00:05:36.629> the<00:05:37.629> second<00:05:38.620> well<00:05:39.219> I'm

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:39.969 
then only do I clone the second well I'm

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:42.990 
then only do I clone the second well I'm
basically<00:05:40.229> cloning<00:05:41.229> this<00:05:41.469> one<00:05:41.620> over<00:05:41.889> here<00:05:42.159> all

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 
basically cloning this one over here all

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.369 
basically cloning this one over here all
right<00:05:43.029> so<00:05:43.120> I<00:05:43.270> cloning<00:05:43.690> this<00:05:43.779> one<00:05:43.930> over<00:05:44.139> here

00:05:44.369 --> 00:05:44.379 
right so I cloning this one over here

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:46.589 
right so I cloning this one over here
then<00:05:44.889> the<00:05:45.460> next<00:05:45.669> thing<00:05:45.789> is<00:05:45.909> I<00:05:46.029> clone<00:05:46.300> this<00:05:46.479> one

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:46.599 
then the next thing is I clone this one

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:48.209 
then the next thing is I clone this one
over<00:05:46.810> here<00:05:47.050> the<00:05:47.319> next<00:05:47.560> in<00:05:47.620> this<00:05:47.710> one<00:05:47.860> over<00:05:47.979> here

00:05:48.209 --> 00:05:48.219 
over here the next in this one over here

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:50.850 
over here the next in this one over here
this<00:05:48.370> one<00:05:48.490> over<00:05:48.669> here<00:05:49.060> and<00:05:49.240> then<00:05:49.479> I<00:05:49.690> just<00:05:49.860> fill

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:50.860 
this one over here and then I just fill

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.309 
this one over here and then I just fill
that<00:05:51.219> spot<00:05:51.669> with<00:05:52.060> air<00:05:52.389> so<00:05:52.719> I'd<00:05:52.810> remove<00:05:53.139> the

00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:53.319 
that spot with air so I'd remove the

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:54.420 
that spot with air so I'd remove the
block<00:05:53.500> by<00:05:53.650> filling<00:05:53.889> it<00:05:53.979> with<00:05:54.039> it

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
block by filling it with it

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.550 
block by filling it with it
okay<00:05:54.940> so<00:05:55.029> that<00:05:55.330> removes<00:05:55.599> that<00:05:55.719> the<00:05:56.259> clones

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
okay so that removes that the clones

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.070 
okay so that removes that the clones
clones<00:05:57.009> clones<00:05:57.490> and<00:05:57.789> then<00:05:58.449> this<00:05:58.659> just

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
clones clones and then this just

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.290 
clones clones and then this just
replaces<00:05:59.740> or<00:06:00.279> sets<00:06:00.580> the<00:06:00.789> block<00:06:01.000> of<00:06:01.210> the<00:06:01.839> actual

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
replaces or sets the block of the actual

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.589 
replaces or sets the block of the actual
of<00:06:04.300> the<00:06:04.629> actual<00:06:04.990> beacon<00:06:05.469> to<00:06:06.069> a<00:06:06.099> okay<00:06:06.940> so<00:06:07.120> if<00:06:07.419> I

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:07.599 
of the actual beacon to a okay so if I

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:09.719 
of the actual beacon to a okay so if I
actually<00:06:07.839> let<00:06:08.560> me<00:06:08.650> just<00:06:08.680> power<00:06:09.039> this<00:06:09.310> block<00:06:09.580> so

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:09.729 
actually let me just power this block so

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:10.860 
actually let me just power this block so
that<00:06:09.759> you<00:06:09.909> can<00:06:10.029> see<00:06:10.150> what<00:06:10.270> happens<00:06:10.539> if<00:06:10.750> I<00:06:10.810> don't

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:10.870 
that you can see what happens if I don't

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.559 
that you can see what happens if I don't
actually<00:06:11.349> power<00:06:11.680> this<00:06:12.029> you'll<00:06:13.029> see<00:06:13.120> that<00:06:13.300> that

00:06:13.559 --> 00:06:13.569 
actually power this you'll see that that

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:15.749 
actually power this you'll see that that
beacon<00:06:13.870> block<00:06:14.080> stays<00:06:14.409> over<00:06:14.770> there<00:06:14.919> okay<00:06:15.460> if<00:06:15.669> i

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:15.759 
beacon block stays over there okay if i

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:20.610 
beacon block stays over there okay if i
deep<00:06:16.000> power<00:06:16.270> it<00:06:16.830> it<00:06:17.830> will<00:06:18.069> be<00:06:18.159> removed<00:06:19.560> okay<00:06:20.560> so

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:20.620 
deep power it it will be removed okay so

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.860 
deep power it it will be removed okay so
that's<00:06:20.830> really<00:06:21.039> basically<00:06:22.029> it<00:06:22.330> I<00:06:22.360> mean<00:06:22.629> if<00:06:22.750> you

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:22.870

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.659 
that's really basically it I mean if you
kind<00:06:23.259> of<00:06:23.349> get<00:06:23.650> a<00:06:23.680> bit<00:06:23.860> more<00:06:24.039> clever<00:06:24.310> you<00:06:24.460> can

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:24.669 
kind of get a bit more clever you can

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:28.439 
kind of get a bit more clever you can
actually<00:06:24.969> do<00:06:25.240> something<00:06:25.479> like<00:06:26.849> this<00:06:27.849> so<00:06:28.240> let
