00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:06.319
 Dr. Juan JosÃ© Goiti Unibaso is 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.900
 cardiac surgeon and belongs to top 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:11.360
 doctors the select circle of doctors from 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.160
 first level of Spain as an expert in 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.390
 coronary bypass will explain us the 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.390
 details of this surgery 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.960
 What is a coronary bypass? 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.430
 while all this is the technique 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:29.680
 surgical to solve the problem 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.439
 back from Rioverde heart is to say 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.750
 when there are complete obstructions or 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.879
 partial coronary arteries that 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.010
 limit the amount of blood available 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:41.769
 for the cardiac muscle to do its 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.360
 then you function against what 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:46.690
 we have can we do is a body 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:49.739
 astral that is to contribute spend the 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.739
 equipazo needs 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.550
 in which case it is used 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.230
 as I said at the beginning that our 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.470
 organism is a surgical technique for 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.200
 give him more blood too 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:07.320
 consequently what is achieved with 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:10.230
 the radio is that this heart receiving 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.290
 more blood is able to recover its 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.270
 functionality and above all what is the 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.700
 fundamental symptom of the lack of irrigation 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.460
 to the heart test chest angina or the 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.860
 stealing others we know that a delay 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.250
 schedule has practically a 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.560
 absolute reliability to remove angina and 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.620
 what it is in terms of the future we know 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.619
 that can also prolong life and in 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.869
 very specific warnings 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.160
 we consider important in certain 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.220
 parts of the coronaries 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.530
 the radio master guarantees a 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.540
 Survival greater than any other 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.140
 technique that exists right now 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.140
 available 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.990
 what risks are there when practicing 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.990
 intervention 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.079
 but you have to understand two things first 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.689
 apart are the risks of something that 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.420
 we want to produce that is a source of 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:06.299
 risk we want to solve by giving it 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.420
 more blood to the heart carries the risk 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:12.060
 that in doing so we do not have 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.040
 success to solve it and it usually happens that 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.720
 have a myocardial infarction or a 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.420
 damage in that shipment here that we want 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.970
 protect you have to think that is the risk 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.920
 It is very small because 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.319
 fundamentally when you accept the 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.290
 form, nothing is removed from the 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.480
 forms what we do is add other 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.549
 pipes to the heart or other vessels to another 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.579
 area to give you more watering in 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:37.470
 consequence if that new bypass 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:40.380
 coronary that new pipe that we put 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.010
 it does not work the patient is going to be like 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.349
 I was previously 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.900
 yes it is true that there are other rivers 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:49.299
 associates that are the risks inherent in 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.610
 a patient for other pathologies there is 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:53.470
 understand a patient that is a symptom 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.019
 Severe worker may have problems 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.849
 Respiratory after surgery as 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:01.150
 it can happen with any intervention 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:04.659
 surgical major removing that let's say is 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:08.470
 this type of surgery is very safe very 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:10.959
 contrasted and without hesitation right now is 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.209
 a surgery for offering that the greatest 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:16.599
 part of the cases very low risks 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:21.120
 risks below 1% in terms of 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:21.120
 procedure mortality risk 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.890
 how long will the patient take 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.890
 recuperate 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.670
 the operation has a coronary surgery 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.620
 and the state depends fundamentally 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.870
 physical of that encounter 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.980
 you have to understand that the point of view 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.720
 from the heart 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.730
 almost as soon as it's finished 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.220
 the surgery that is proposed is in 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.959
 much more perfect condition 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.110
 better than those that were before the 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.000
 surgery 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.190
 around here they are giving themselves weapons 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.150
 you need that caliber 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.830
 all the contribution and consequently goes to 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.810
 find yourself much better than before 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.840
 what happens is that to get to 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.120
 that point we had to interfere with 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.920
 some way like the rib cage like 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.380
 if I did not have to open from the center from 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.320
 some more or less invasive mind 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.880
 to the contribution of reaching the heart and that is 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.720
 what we are going to leave the time of 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.060
 Recovery 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.560
 understand that if they also exist 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.760
 particular conditions of each 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:24.580
 patient in terms of artistic form 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:26.680
 AIDS runs diabetes or other 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.040
 problems will take a little longer 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.040
 time to recover
