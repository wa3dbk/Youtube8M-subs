00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 the invention is the idea behind it 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.830
 already older for the space flights of 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.500
 nasa was explored years ago 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.040
 like the air in the space stations 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:16.710
 could be filtered and detoxified 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:20.910
 a possible way of planting for certain 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.189
 clean air in the universe came such 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.859
 Never use air purifier for the job 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.769
 in this nursery in celle but lives 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.970
 the idea continues 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.619
 helge knickmeier wants with these 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.110
 Indoor plants are not the air in 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.200
 space glider but in quite normal 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.329
 living areas clean the green plants well 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.129
 Everyone knows about the indoor climate 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.290
 but to pollutants from the room air 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.149
 it's not easy to pick it up 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.670
 to put a flower pot in the room 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.920
 are 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.409
 the main cleaning performance 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.420
 it was over the rootstock therefore 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:55.089
 the task is the ambient air at the 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.859
 to bring root world 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:01:00.320
 The solution is this patented 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:02.600
 Plant container is one of them 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.399
 Pedestal for water an outer shell and 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:09.439
 an opposing pot in which the plant 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:12.259
 The guitar pot is put into the 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:14.899
 stop system used the top system 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:17.360
 is open at the bottom designed the air comes 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:20.060
 here a gap between inside and 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.310
 from the outside pot tapers upwards 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.330
 This creates a fireplace effect and the 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.190
 room air is at the roots 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.649
 past 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:30.950
 to find the ideal shape needed it 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.600
 Ten years of development now pouring 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.729
 the air so through the head that the 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.429
 plant together with the soil bacteria 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.459
 Toxins in the ambient air into harmless 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:41.840
 can transform connections 

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:43.729
 These poisons can be for example 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.429
 carpet glue colors or furniture 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.590
 the inventor knows well how to exfoliate 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:49.819
 Ill do what we do every day 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.500
 breathe in 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:52.970
 I lived as a child under extreme 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.570
 hay fever 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.540
 allergic reactions and 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.369
 detergents and fuels and off 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.290
 according to which, for a solution 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.430
 wanted that from at least home 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.110
 was freed from this problem yet holds 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.410
 the construction what you invent 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.560
 We promise we will do a test 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.180
 helps us Baubiologe claus he Podewski 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.010
 should measure on the plants actually 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.010
 filter poison from the air 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.290
 in this lounge the 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.290
 test instead 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.090
 First, we deliberately poison the 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.480
 raumluft two ladies from the nursery 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.620
 Smoke in the service of science 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.630
 Tobacco smoke is a good one 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.530
 comparative scale for residential poisons 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:44.110
 furniture or colors 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.250
 it's a level and toxins are accurate 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.160
 the same forces as in one 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.440
 Cigarette as an example of formaldehyde 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.320
 difference against tobacco smoke helps 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:57.430
 ventilate residences from carpet or wall 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.990
 on the other hand, we constantly have to go for it 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:04.510
 next will be in formaldehyde next 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:07.210
 this space the expert point in air 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.670
 a test tube shows its discoloration 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:12.940
 how much of the carcinogenic poison 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.340
 Formaldehyde in the room air is okay 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.110
 then we have the result 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.420
 we are here in the year around 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.700
 the 20 times higher concentration 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:25.570
 whether this poison content overnight of 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:29.050
 alone decreases a first test shows without 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:32.800
 the plants he is only 15 ppm 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:34.810
 1 3 ppm back parts per million is the 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.580
 unit of concentration 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.430
 I saw that concentration 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.470
 Almost stayed now for the 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:46.110
 Compare the measurement with the plants 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.110
 four pots put inventors in the room 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:54.050
 then again it will create the violence 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.110
 plant in the next 24 hours 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.520
 to filter out poison 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.530
 I assume that after we choose 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.120
 have filled the room with plants 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:06.620
 Tomorrow, the former 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:09.290
 concentration for zero has gone 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.180
 next day the building biologist klaus 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.890
 podewski comes to the air again 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.830
 to measure in our test room 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:20.570
 how does the result with the plants look 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:22.880
 yesterday was the formaldehyde 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.600
 concentration still 20 times above that 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.410
 limit 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.410
 and now 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:37.960
 the result is now an ad 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.639
 but then the result sums up 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.870
 not really on my side 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:43.319
 it is surprising that we 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:46.479
 of course also came here to plant 

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:50.680
 again the comparison or the plants 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:54.099
 the load only dropped from 15 ppm to 1 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:57.099
 3 ppm during the test with the plants 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:05:01.080
 initially even more poison in the room 2 ppm 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:01.080
 but nothing remained of that 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.259
 in the next few weeks, the distribution should 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:08.960
 the green invention start with 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:12.860
 several different plant species and 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:15.800
 the inventor wants more than just a plan 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:18.710
 are great systems for open-plan offices like 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:21.020
 reception halls and hotels as well as 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.310
 We still produce small systems 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.280
 on the office table and on the 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:27.380
 Window sill belong to it would be an idea 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.729
 from space research throughout 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.729
 normal living room arrived
