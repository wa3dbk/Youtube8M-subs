00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
stuff to do in the game on my iPhone and

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.339 
stuff to do in the game on my iPhone and
you<00:00:12.210> were<00:00:12.330> like<00:00:12.480> why<00:00:12.630> balls<00:00:12.990> didn't<00:00:13.290> you

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
you were like why balls didn't you

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.950 
you were like why balls didn't you
record<00:00:13.710> all<00:00:13.860> that<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:14.340> I<00:00:14.549> mean<00:00:15.120> kind<00:00:15.509> of<00:00:15.630> agree

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
record all that and I mean kind of agree

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.510

but<00:00:16.170> on<00:00:16.260> my<00:00:16.379> iPad<00:00:16.740> I<00:00:16.770> haven't<00:00:17.130> done<00:00:17.250> it<00:00:17.369> yet

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
but on my iPad I haven't done it yet

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.890 
but on my iPad I haven't done it yet
because<00:00:17.550> it<00:00:17.789> doesn't<00:00:18.090> transfer<00:00:18.359> all<00:00:18.750> your

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
because it doesn't transfer all your

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.140 
because it doesn't transfer all your
progress<00:00:19.109> so<00:00:19.500> I'm<00:00:20.160> thinking<00:00:20.609> I<00:00:20.670> might<00:00:20.789> just<00:00:21.029> do
