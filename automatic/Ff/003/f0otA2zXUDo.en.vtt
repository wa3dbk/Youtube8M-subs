00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.849
 I am already judo for a very long time 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.529
 since 2005 and there I thought so 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.210
 I was a year fully involved 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.369
 I said to myself yes I want to go too 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.750
 help with my nation with two boats 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.180
 So I actually reported to 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.670
 for my little brother or middle one 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.050
 brother to wear the head have me 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.210
 volunteered because already the years 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.759
 previously helped here and now for 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.750
 always worn the lists i have 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.149
 the technology was built up 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.090
 I volunteer here 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.340
 we say and I am for safety 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.300
 Here I say we say everything 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.309
 As for regulatory 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.770
 everything they have different 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.719
 you really have to come from nationalities 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.430
 spoke with different cope 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.930
 and sometimes it just has to be difficult 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.059
 do that a bit diplomatically and 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.530
 then it works like the tournament on 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.449
 Wednesday had been the first time here 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.559
 was not even in this hall and 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.120
 Now you suddenly see that you 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.079
 really horny fights take place 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.079
 and that's really great 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.930
 yes, that's pretty much the athletes 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:15.020
 nose and that you support them 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.910
 can then also see how can 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.770
 prepare for the fight so that says 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.440
 Everything goes well when you go for the 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.940
 Safety is there you never have so much 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.570
 take time to fight 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.570
 focus 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.480
 I'm looking forward to the lmbv joker 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.920
 the Germans are my darlings the 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.330
 Of course, like to take care of you because most of them 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.670
 I also know from the Youth Mai 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.750
 she goes for example aaron hildebrand 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.000
 marc odenthal 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.050
 I'm just happy now I can 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.670
 I guess now I have probably now 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.619
 Not at all future, I know myself too 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.840
 Especially interested are first of all 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.729
 times the German and then the 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.890
 some japanese which I find quite 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.020
 Cool as well as the content of the fighting style 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.300
 So of course that's solar too 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.770
 the most outstanding local sports 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.780
 So a pretty big model too 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.950
 for many and there so synonymous jumps around 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.020
 that's just the cool that you too 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.020
 keep the judokas to it is that you never 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.830
 can accompany to the mats and stars 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.840
 to touch 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.930
 aaron hildebrand has the first 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:16.190
 lost fight but that's why I am too 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:19.250
 here with the final and gone 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.230
 then totally finished what I thought 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:28.670
 would have 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:31.540
 That really was not a list 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.540
 I have to carry 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.750
 That's when you walk around here 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.100
 just sees that helped with 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.090
 that's really possible here 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.290
 is really incredible 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.790
 In general, we pretty much do it all 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.900
 Have fun with the children too 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.370
 a bit like hers too 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.660
 to bring whole athletes close 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.060
 because sometimes have to explain 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.640
 So I thought it was great that you 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.770
 stop with well-known athletes thus one 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.510
 can go matte but also from there 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.880
 to the people can see and the 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.440
 also fight with one another 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:08.420
 nation can exchange over all 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.890
 again different things always help 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.630
 used and I thought so yes 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.780
 if I can interfere already here 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.000
 worn directly from the ice 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:20.390
 if you are a European champion or something 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.690
 But should everyone is loyal sportsman 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.130
 important something special just the 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.019
 atmosphere you can along with the 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.630
 fighters are for example the above 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:31.100
 People can bring the food you have to 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.900
 you also past the fighters and so on 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.850
 then you see them and you can do that 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.320
 also one or the other autograph or 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.660
 to collect a photo 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.580
 yes, yes, we also make ourselves jews 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.980
 and then you can see how 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:45.769
 this is going to happen and later that is the 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.959
 best was that I from yesterday the 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.519
 Andreas TÃ¶lzer had seen that was yes 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.450
 unfortunately that he does not make a young man 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.450
 but that was my big role model 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.390
 I would like to be there again
