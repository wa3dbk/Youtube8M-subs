00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
right there to the right of me I'm just

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.330 
right there to the right of me I'm just
drag<00:03:49.419> all<00:03:49.659> of<00:03:49.720> them<00:03:49.959> to<00:03:50.769> the<00:03:50.889> back<00:03:51.069> of<00:03:51.099> their

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
drag all of them to the back of their

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.800 
drag all of them to the back of their
because<00:03:51.669> they<00:03:51.790> can't<00:03:52.000> reach<00:03:52.180> you<00:03:52.389> and<00:03:52.569> you<00:03:52.659> can

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
because they can't reach you and you can

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.990 
because they can't reach you and you can
still<00:03:52.989> attack<00:03:53.229> them<00:03:53.500> so<00:03:54.250> if<00:03:54.489> you're<00:03:54.669> running

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
still attack them so if you're running

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.280 
still attack them so if you're running
low<00:03:55.269> on<00:03:55.299> prayer<00:03:55.629> or<00:03:55.780> something<00:03:55.959> like<00:03:56.229> that

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
low on prayer or something like that

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.809 
low on prayer or something like that
you're<00:03:57.009> just<00:03:57.159> going<00:03:57.340> to<00:03:57.400> want<00:03:57.549> to<00:03:57.579> drag<00:03:57.790> it

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
you're just going to want to drag it

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:01.979 
you're just going to want to drag it
over<00:03:57.969> there<00:03:58.530> I<00:04:00.269> highly<00:04:01.269> recommend<00:04:01.389> you<00:04:01.780> use

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
over there I highly recommend you use

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:05.280 
over there I highly recommend you use
the<00:04:02.169> EEOC<00:04:02.969> instead<00:04:03.969> of<00:04:04.060> the<00:04:04.150> legacy<00:04:04.569> mode<00:04:04.750> for

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
the EEOC instead of the legacy mode for

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.369 
the EEOC instead of the legacy mode for
this<00:04:05.439> just<00:04:05.739> because<00:04:06.040> I<00:04:07.079> personally<00:04:08.079> think

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:08.379 
this just because I personally think

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:11.249 
this just because I personally think
killing<00:04:08.979> these<00:04:09.280> with<00:04:09.900> abilities<00:04:10.900> is<00:04:11.079> much

00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:11.259 
killing these with abilities is much

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:14.459 
killing these with abilities is much
faster<00:04:11.590> and<00:04:12.359> you<00:04:13.359> know<00:04:13.449> more<00:04:13.750> efficient<00:04:14.319> than

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:14.469 
faster and you know more efficient than

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:17.849 
faster and you know more efficient than
you<00:04:14.829> doing<00:04:15.280> it<00:04:15.400> with<00:04:16.199> legacy<00:04:17.199> mode<00:04:17.409> and<00:04:17.650> it's

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
you doing it with legacy mode and it's

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.849 
you doing it with legacy mode and it's
also<00:04:18.820> much<00:04:19.239> cheaper<00:04:19.320> which<00:04:20.320> I<00:04:20.500> know<00:04:20.560> you<00:04:20.620> guys

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
also much cheaper which I know you guys

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.189 
also much cheaper which I know you guys
like<00:04:21.130> now<00:04:22.120> you're<00:04:22.300> just<00:04:22.360> when<00:04:22.630> I<00:04:22.690> go<00:04:22.900> you're

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:23.199 
like now you're just when I go you're

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:24.450 
like now you're just when I go you're
just<00:04:23.380> going<00:04:23.529> to<00:04:23.590> want<00:04:23.710> to<00:04:23.740> kill<00:04:23.919> these<00:04:24.130> until

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
just going to want to kill these until

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.870 
just going to want to kill these until
you<00:04:24.580> have<00:04:24.699> a<00:04:24.729> full<00:04:25.000> inventory<00:04:25.389> and<00:04:26.729> yeah<00:04:27.729> guys

you have a full inventory and yeah guys
it's<00:04:28.060> pretty<00:04:28.270> straightforward<00:04:29.099> so<00:04:30.099> I'll<00:04:30.279> cut

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
it's pretty straightforward so I'll cut

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.469 
it's pretty straightforward so I'll cut
to<00:04:30.580> the<00:04:30.669> clip<00:04:30.909> where<00:04:31.210> I<00:04:31.560> finish<00:04:32.560> my<00:04:32.590> inventory

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 
to the clip where I finish my inventory

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:37.019 
to the clip where I finish my inventory
not<00:04:34.479> to<00:04:34.630> go<00:04:34.779> back<00:04:34.960> it's<00:04:35.169> very<00:04:35.469> simple<00:04:36.029> make

00:04:37.019 --> 00:04:37.029 
not to go back it's very simple make

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:38.550 
not to go back it's very simple make
sure<00:04:37.060> that<00:04:37.510> if<00:04:37.659> you<00:04:37.779> have<00:04:37.930> one<00:04:38.110> more<00:04:38.289> inventory

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
sure that if you have one more inventory

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.010 
sure that if you have one more inventory
space<00:04:38.979> or<00:04:39.190> something<00:04:39.460> like<00:04:39.550> that<00:04:39.610> you<00:04:39.969> go<00:04:40.870> over

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
space or something like that you go over

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.240 
space or something like that you go over
here<00:04:41.349> first<00:04:41.560> because<00:04:41.740> they're<00:04:42.039> probably

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
here first because they're probably

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.950 
here first because they're probably
going<00:04:42.430> to<00:04:42.520> these<00:04:43.180> monsters<00:04:43.599> are<00:04:43.630> probably

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
going to these monsters are probably

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.200 
going to these monsters are probably
going<00:04:44.080> to<00:04:44.169> be<00:04:44.260> a<00:04:44.289> grow<00:04:44.620> on<00:04:44.740> you<00:04:45.000> so<00:04:46.000> it's<00:04:46.120> going

you guys could probably easily make 1.8
mil<00:07:12.550> per<00:07:12.669> hour<00:07:12.789> maybe<00:07:13.390> even<00:07:13.659> two<00:07:13.839> mil<00:07:13.990> per<00:07:14.140> hour

but<00:07:15.010> i<00:07:15.070> would<00:07:15.640> safely<00:07:15.969> suggest<00:07:16.510> this<00:07:16.690> method

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:17.079 
but i would safely suggest this method

00:07:17.079 --> 00:07:23.360 
but i would safely suggest this method
is<00:07:17.200> around<00:07:17.409> 1.4<00:07:18.310> 1.5<00:07:19.140> to<00:07:20.140> 1.8<00:07:20.849> 1.9<00:07:21.849> and

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:23.370 
is around 1.4 1.5 to 1.8 1.9 and

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:26.639 
is around 1.4 1.5 to 1.8 1.9 and

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:26.649 
obviously this also gives very very very

00:07:26.649 --> 00:07:29.699 
obviously this also gives very very very
