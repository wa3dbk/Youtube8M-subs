go<00:02:25.489> that<00:02:26.489> really<00:02:26.730> keeps<00:02:26.940> it<00:02:27.090> kind<00:02:27.359> of<00:02:27.390> funky

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
go that really keeps it kind of funky

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.780 
go that really keeps it kind of funky

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
and gritty then the last thing that I

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.520 
and gritty then the last thing that I
played<00:02:30.090> I<00:02:30.120> threw<00:02:30.570> in<00:02:30.690> the<00:02:30.810> old<00:02:30.930> Hendrix<00:02:31.350> chord

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
played I threw in the old Hendrix chord

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:39.559

the<00:02:31.680> 7<00:02:32.040> sharp<00:02:32.310> 9<00:02:32.579> chord<00:02:38.060> now<00:02:39.060> that's<00:02:39.269> another

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
the 7 sharp 9 chord now that's another

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.210 
the 7 sharp 9 chord now that's another
great<00:02:39.870> color<00:02:40.140> and<00:02:40.260> that's<00:02:40.410> really<00:02:40.620> crying<00:02:40.950> out
