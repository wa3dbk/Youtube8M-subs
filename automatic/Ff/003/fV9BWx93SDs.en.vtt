see i saw one on xbox and like most some
people<00:00:37.829> are<00:00:37.949> on<00:00:38.100> xbox<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:39.089> works<00:00:39.300> for<00:00:39.480> ps3

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
people are on xbox this works for ps3

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.189 
people are on xbox this works for ps3
same<00:00:40.140> thing<00:00:40.440> so<00:00:41.309> all<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.489> have<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.760> do<00:00:41.940> and

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:42.199 
same thing so all you have to do and

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:44.720 
same thing so all you have to do and
this<00:00:43.199> is<00:00:43.260> basically<00:00:43.559> treasuring<00:00:44.190> glitch<00:00:44.429> and

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
this is basically treasuring glitch and

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.669 
this is basically treasuring glitch and
it's<00:00:44.879> much<00:00:45.059> more<00:00:45.239> easier<00:00:45.569> for<00:00:45.719> xbox<00:00:46.140> i<00:00:46.379> think

00:00:46.669 --> 00:00:46.679 
it's much more easier for xbox i think

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:49.130 
it's much more easier for xbox i think
all<00:00:47.579> i<00:00:47.699> have<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.819> do<00:00:47.999> is<00:00:48.239> go<00:00:48.539> right<00:00:48.719> here<00:00:48.960> and

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
to do is run there or you can jump at

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.840 
to do is run there or you can jump at
the<00:03:03.959> egg<00:03:04.170> but<00:03:04.440> it<00:03:04.890> doesn't<00:03:05.220> work<00:03:05.370> with<00:03:05.550> me<00:03:05.670> when

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
the egg but it doesn't work with me when

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.490 
the egg but it doesn't work with me when
i<00:03:05.910> jump<00:03:06.209> because<00:03:06.510> I<00:03:06.690> jump<00:03:06.930> into<00:03:07.080> like<00:03:07.260> too

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
i jump because I jump into like too

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.820 
i jump because I jump into like too
early<00:03:07.950> you<00:03:08.760> land<00:03:09.000> here<00:03:09.090> all<00:03:09.780> you<00:03:10.170> do<00:03:10.380> is<00:03:10.620> you

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
early you land here all you do is you

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.490 
early you land here all you do is you
can<00:03:10.980> either<00:03:11.130> go<00:03:11.400> through<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:11.970> right<00:03:12.390> side

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
can either go through the right side

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.100 
can either go through the right side
which<00:03:13.500> is<00:03:13.860> I<00:03:14.069> think<00:03:14.250> easier<00:03:14.970> but<00:03:15.209> I<00:03:15.420> sometimes

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
which is I think easier but I sometimes

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.900 
which is I think easier but I sometimes
just<00:03:16.440> do<00:03:16.560> it<00:03:16.650> this<00:03:16.769> way<00:03:16.950> because<00:03:17.010> I<00:03:17.430> really

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
just do it this way because I really

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.400 
just do it this way because I really
don't<00:03:18.060> feel<00:03:18.180> I<00:03:18.239> can<00:03:18.510> just<00:03:18.780> go<00:03:18.930> through<00:03:19.140> here

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
don't feel I can just go through here

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.819 
don't feel I can just go through here
and<00:03:20.280> yeah<00:03:20.430> you're<00:03:20.670> in<00:03:21.200> never<00:03:22.200> just<00:03:22.530> have<00:03:22.650> to

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
and yeah you're in never just have to

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:26.090 
and yeah you're in never just have to
walk<00:03:23.100> all<00:03:23.600> see<00:03:24.600> you<00:03:25.019> can<00:03:25.200> go<00:03:25.380> now<00:03:25.620> I'll<00:03:25.920> show

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
you and there'll be much easier I just

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.470 
you and there'll be much easier I just
felt<00:03:29.130> like<00:03:29.160> doing<00:03:29.459> it<00:03:29.549> this<00:03:29.670> way<00:03:29.730> because<00:03:30.060> I

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
felt like doing it this way because I

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.569 
felt like doing it this way because I
was<00:03:31.230> really<00:03:31.470> farming<00:03:31.829> but<00:03:31.950> I<00:03:32.010> will<00:03:32.250> soon
