 invites precisely to share with the 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.480
 others with the least they have is a 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:36.570
 time when he invites us to do 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.260
 practicing this value of love is a 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:43.650
 time in which we are allowed or 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.440
 it's a bit easier for us to live with 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.829
 the whole family get closer to those 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.470
 that during the year sometimes we can not 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:55.230
 approach us by the distance or by 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:57.750

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.090
 the one that is Christmas 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.579
 invites to make peace with 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.790
 people that we have some difficulty 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.370
 finally Christmas is a time of harmony 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:12.390

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:14.790

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.910
 that you live Christmas with those values 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.090
 with the value of love with the love of 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:27.150
 share with love with the value of 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.660
 service and that all this human wealth 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.820
 that you have that Christmas is a good 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.610
 pretext to be able to share 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.940
 just a gift but share your 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.920
 person share your time there are times 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.700
 for example in your colony surely 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.340
 there will be some sick person to someone who 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:50.460
 be of very low resources and inclusive 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.140
 lower resources than us and that 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.290
 we have the possibility to share 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.900
 some food with them this time it 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.420
 pay much for that we celebrate the 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.939
 Christmas like this 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.900
 this fact of the birth of Jesus that 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:09.810
 invites us to return to our 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.870
 to our human center which is the one 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.110
 it makes us precisely great then 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.810
 let's not get lost a bit with the purchases 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.420
 or thinking that Christmas is 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.100
 necessarily give something something expensive to 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.400
 Sometimes what we find most difficult beings 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.980
 human is to give our time to 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.580
 who else needs to give us a gift 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.519
 advice to whoever requires it 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:39.360
 then this Christmas time receives 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:42.269
 a very affectionate hug from me and from 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:46.049
 part of all of us who work in 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:47.670
 this school with the wishes that in your 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.610
 family spilled many blessings 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.819
 that everything you want for you and 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.970
 for yours to become a reality 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.970
