00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
whole scraping thing that then i used i

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.389 
whole scraping thing that then i used i
like<00:00:33.530> to<00:00:33.770> use<00:00:33.800> a<00:00:35.410> paper<00:00:36.410> that<00:00:36.559> has<00:00:36.829> texture<00:00:37.219> in

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
like to use a paper that has texture in

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:38.470 
like to use a paper that has texture in
it<00:00:37.489> because<00:00:37.730> there's<00:00:37.969> so<00:00:38.059> many<00:00:38.179> things<00:00:38.269> you

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
it because there's so many things you

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.880 
it because there's so many things you
can<00:00:38.629> do<00:00:38.749> so<00:00:38.929> say<00:00:39.260> i<00:00:39.289> have<00:00:39.649> my<00:00:40.120> white<00:00:41.120> paint<00:00:41.449> here

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
can do so say i have my white paint here

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.189 
can do so say i have my white paint here
so<00:00:42.890> i'm<00:00:43.070> going<00:00:43.249> to<00:00:43.309> paint<00:00:43.609> over<00:00:44.089> the<00:00:44.989> top<00:00:45.170> of

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:45.199 
so i'm going to paint over the top of

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:47.410 
so i'm going to paint over the top of
this<00:00:45.409> just<00:00:45.649> to<00:00:45.769> blend<00:00:46.550> these<00:00:46.730> all<00:00:46.909> together<00:00:47.089> so

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
this just to blend these all together so

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.180 
this just to blend these all together so
these<00:00:47.539> layers<00:00:47.870> are<00:00:48.019> all<00:00:48.170> kind<00:00:48.469> of<00:00:48.530> becoming

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
these layers are all kind of becoming

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.180 
these layers are all kind of becoming
one<00:00:50.859> just

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.400 

I'm<00:00:55.190> making<00:00:55.370> a<00:00:55.670> part<00:00:55.970> of<00:00:56.030> that<00:00:56.270> whole<00:00:56.450> yes<00:00:56.960> and

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
I'm making a part of that whole yes and

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:58.930 
I'm making a part of that whole yes and
then<00:00:57.560> it's<00:00:57.710> not<00:00:57.890> a<00:00:57.920> bunch<00:00:58.220> of<00:00:58.340> pieces<00:00:58.520> that<00:00:58.730> are

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
then it's not a bunch of pieces that are

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.600 
then it's not a bunch of pieces that are
just<00:00:59.150> you<00:00:59.630> know<00:00:59.750> there<00:01:00.170> but<00:01:00.680> then<00:01:00.890> if<00:01:01.160> I<00:01:01.340> wanted

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:01.610 
just you know there but then if I wanted

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.680 
just you know there but then if I wanted
to<00:01:01.700> add<00:01:02.140> like<00:01:03.140> a<00:01:03.670> even<00:01:04.670> more<00:01:04.879> texture<00:01:05.330> again

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
to add like a even more texture again

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.140 
to add like a even more texture again
I'm<00:01:05.840> using<00:01:05.870> my<00:01:06.140> finger<00:01:06.590> and<00:01:06.830> kind<00:01:06.979> of<00:01:07.150> putting

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
I'm using my finger and kind of putting

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.480 
I'm using my finger and kind of putting
something<00:01:08.270> on<00:01:08.630> it<00:01:08.960> and<00:01:09.110> then<00:01:09.200> Gabby<00:01:09.440> I<00:01:09.920> just<00:01:10.310> a

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
something on it and then Gabby I just a

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
something on it and then Gabby I just a
likely<00:01:11.000> open<00:01:11.180> the<00:01:11.390> top<00:01:11.510> of<00:01:11.930> the<00:01:12.080> texture<00:01:13.510> yeah

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
likely open the top of the texture yeah

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.560 
likely open the top of the texture yeah
so<00:01:14.810> I<00:01:14.869> could<00:01:15.110> do<00:01:15.200> that<00:01:15.380> with<00:01:16.119> hot<00:01:17.119> significant

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
so I could do that with hot significant

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:24.660 
so I could do that with hot significant
others<00:01:17.900> like<00:01:18.350> I<00:01:18.470> can<00:01:18.680> use<00:01:18.860> the<00:01:19.369> peak<00:01:19.640> over<00:01:20.330> the

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.820 

not<00:01:25.670> just<00:01:25.910> arrested<00:01:26.360> um<00:01:26.540> the<00:01:27.320> other<00:01:27.350> thing<00:01:27.590> I

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
not just arrested um the other thing I

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:28.960 
not just arrested um the other thing I
have<00:01:28.009> on<00:01:28.160> here<00:01:28.369> that<00:01:28.399> I<00:01:28.490> want<00:01:28.520> to<00:01:28.670> show<00:01:28.790> you<00:01:28.850> is

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
have on here that I want to show you is

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.389 
have on here that I want to show you is
how<00:01:29.420> to<00:01:29.570> do<00:01:30.050> stuff<00:01:30.110> with<00:01:30.530> dots<00:01:30.770> so<00:01:31.100> we'll<00:01:31.220> see

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
how to do stuff with dots so we'll see

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:33.460 
how to do stuff with dots so we'll see
these<00:01:31.610> dots<00:01:31.880> you<00:01:32.509> just<00:01:32.690> use<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:32.960> back<00:01:33.110> of<00:01:33.350> your

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
these dots you just use the back of your

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.740 
these dots you just use the back of your
paint<00:01:33.770> brush<00:01:33.950> and<00:01:34.399> just<00:01:37.270> the<00:01:38.270> dots<00:01:38.450> will<00:01:38.630> get

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
paint brush and just the dots will get

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.060 
paint brush and just the dots will get
smaller<00:01:38.869> and<00:01:39.170> smaller<00:01:39.259> so<00:01:39.619> if<00:01:39.710> you<00:01:39.770> wanted<00:01:39.979> to

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
smaller and smaller so if you wanted to

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.960 
smaller and smaller so if you wanted to
be<00:01:40.160> exact<00:01:40.610> same<00:01:40.850> size<00:01:41.119> you<00:01:41.990> would<00:01:42.050> want<00:01:42.320> to<00:01:42.970> dip

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
be exact same size you would want to dip

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.980 
be exact same size you would want to dip
it<00:01:44.149> every<00:01:44.570> single<00:01:44.780> time<00:01:46.240> texture<00:01:47.240> how<00:01:47.750> you<00:01:47.810> do

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
it every single time texture how you do

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.820 
it every single time texture how you do
poker<00:01:48.229> offices<00:01:48.590> you<00:01:48.680> do<00:01:48.830> it

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
poker offices you do it

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.500 
poker offices you do it
cross<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:51.980> then<00:01:52.980> you<00:01:53.100> go<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.640> little<00:01:54.060> bit<00:01:54.360> up

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
and do it exactly in the middle of where

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.340 
and do it exactly in the middle of where
those<00:01:57.360> would<00:01:57.540> have<00:01:57.570> been<00:01:57.660> then<00:01:58.080> you<00:01:58.170> go<00:01:58.320> back

going<00:03:04.360> to<00:03:04.450> go<00:03:04.600> with<00:03:04.630> my<00:03:04.900> finger<00:03:05.290> and<00:03:05.860> you're

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
going to go with my finger and you're

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.830 
going to go with my finger and you're
going<00:03:06.160> to<00:03:06.220> be<00:03:06.280> able<00:03:06.310> to<00:03:06.489> see<00:03:06.610> that<00:03:06.760> I

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
going to be able to see that I

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.870 
going to be able to see that I
rubber-stamped<00:03:07.840> over<00:03:08.140> this<00:03:08.290> I<00:03:08.650> guess<00:03:09.550> really

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
rubber-stamped over this I guess really

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.729 
rubber-stamped over this I guess really
rubber<00:03:10.150> stamp<00:03:10.480> all<00:03:10.720> around<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.019> edges

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.770 

you<00:03:14.739> can<00:03:14.950> see<00:03:15.069> that<00:03:15.249> but<00:03:15.849> then<00:03:16.060> I<00:03:16.090> hope<00:03:16.629> this

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
you can see that but then I hope this

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.150 
you can see that but then I hope this
works

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
that's why I usually have tons of

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.720 
that's why I usually have tons of
different<00:03:46.380> projects<00:03:46.950> going<00:03:47.190> Michael<00:03:47.490> be

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
different projects going Michael be

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.070 
different projects going Michael be
working<00:03:48.030> on<00:03:48.120> three<00:03:48.420> different<00:03:48.570> pages<00:03:48.840> at

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
working on three different pages at

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.540 
working on three different pages at
times<00:03:49.320> so<00:03:49.530> that<00:03:49.560> I<00:03:49.710> can<00:03:49.800> put<00:03:50.100> something<00:03:50.340> over

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
times so that I can put something over

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.640 
times so that I can put something over
there<00:03:50.820> to<00:03:51.390> dry<00:03:51.630> and<00:03:51.690> then<00:03:51.870> come<00:03:52.290> back<00:03:52.320> to<00:03:52.470> it

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
there to dry and then come back to it

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.770 
there to dry and then come back to it
later<00:03:52.710> in<00:03:53.100> stride<00:03:53.430> because<00:03:54.270> you<00:03:54.360> really<00:03:54.630> have

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
later in stride because you really have

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.600 
later in stride because you really have
to<00:03:54.960> make<00:03:55.110> sure<00:03:55.320> that<00:03:56.070> it's<00:03:56.190> dragged<00:03:56.430> before

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
to make sure that it's dragged before

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.700 
to make sure that it's dragged before
you<00:03:56.820> get<00:03:56.910> started<00:03:57.060> okay<00:03:58.020> so<00:03:58.110> we'll<00:03:58.290> go<00:03:58.410> back<00:03:58.530> to

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:58.710 
you get started okay so we'll go back to

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.920 
you get started okay so we'll go back to
this<00:03:59.150> now<00:04:00.150> i'm<00:04:00.270> going<00:04:00.360> to<00:04:00.450> keep<00:04:00.600> building

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
this now i'm going to keep building

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.050 
this now i'm going to keep building
building<00:04:01.530> building<00:04:01.560> more<00:04:02.130> layers<00:04:02.370> on<00:04:02.700> top<00:04:02.760> of

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
building building more layers on top of

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.910 
building building more layers on top of
more<00:04:03.180> layer<00:04:03.330> so<00:04:03.570> i'm<00:04:04.050> going<00:04:04.260> to<00:04:04.320> put<00:04:04.410> a<00:04:04.680> dark

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
more layer so i'm going to put a dark

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.980 
more layer so i'm going to put a dark
layer<00:04:05.130> for<00:04:05.400> some<00:04:05.550> contrast<00:04:06.030> and<00:04:06.720> i'm<00:04:06.840> going<00:04:06.930> to

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:06.990 
layer for some contrast and i'm going to

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:17.120 
layer for some contrast and i'm going to
scrape<00:04:07.290> this<00:04:07.590> over<00:04:15.410> but<00:04:16.410> this<00:04:16.530> is<00:04:16.739> another

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
scrape this over but this is another

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.600 
scrape this over but this is another
little<00:04:17.430> pool<00:04:18.170> floaties<00:04:19.170> for<00:04:19.560> PT<00:04:19.950> is<00:04:20.190> this

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:20.610 
little pool floaties for PT is this

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:24.440 
little pool floaties for PT is this
notched<00:04:21.770> spreader<00:04:22.770> or<00:04:23.280> some<00:04:24.120> kind

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
notched spreader or some kind

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.950 
notched spreader or some kind
hard-working<00:04:25.520> shoot<00:04:26.520> maybe<00:04:26.730> push<00:04:27.000> I<00:04:27.210> off<00:04:27.480> peak

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
hard-working shoot maybe push I off peak

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.740 
hard-working shoot maybe push I off peak
at<00:04:28.140> tile<00:04:28.620> sheetrock<00:04:29.130> stuff<00:04:29.400> like<00:04:29.550> that<00:04:29.580> and<00:04:29.910> so

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
at tile sheetrock stuff like that and so

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.490 
at tile sheetrock stuff like that and so
then<00:04:31.350> I<00:04:31.710> can<00:04:32.010> just<00:04:32.040> take<00:04:32.430> this<00:04:32.700> and<00:04:33.510> scrape<00:04:34.470> the

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
then I can just take this and scrape the

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.170 
then I can just take this and scrape the
paint<00:04:34.980> off<00:04:35.310> and<00:04:36.180> a<00:04:36.300> totally<00:04:36.720> pattern<00:04:37.820> and<00:04:38.820> then

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
paint off and a totally pattern and then

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.970 
paint off and a totally pattern and then
it<00:04:39.300> dries<00:04:39.510> like<00:04:39.780> that<00:04:40.020> and<00:04:40.380> then<00:04:40.530> when<00:04:40.560> I<00:04:40.770> build

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
it dries like that and then when I build

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.710 
it dries like that and then when I build
more<00:04:41.310> layers<00:04:41.580> on<00:04:41.790> top<00:04:41.820> of<00:04:42.120> that<00:04:42.240> and<00:04:42.480> it<00:04:42.600> have

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
more layers on top of that and it have

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.330 
more layers on top of that and it have
that<00:04:42.900> layer<00:04:43.080> me<00:04:43.290> and<00:04:43.620> you<00:04:43.680> can<00:04:43.830> still<00:04:44.010> see<00:04:44.190> that

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
that layer me and you can still see that

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.010 
that layer me and you can still see that
blue<00:04:44.610> underneath<00:04:44.910> that<00:04:46.490> so<00:04:47.540> see<00:04:48.540> how<00:04:48.570> cool

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
blue underneath that so see how cool

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.250 
blue underneath that so see how cool
that<00:04:49.440> is<00:04:49.740> now<00:04:50.460> if<00:04:50.730> I<00:04:50.880> wanted<00:04:51.210> to<00:04:51.270> it's<00:04:51.840> got<00:04:52.050> all

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
that is now if I wanted to it's got all

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.170 
that is now if I wanted to it's got all
sorts<00:04:52.290> of<00:04:52.680> different<00:04:52.890> edges<00:04:53.370> this<00:04:53.640> one<00:04:53.820> is<00:04:53.970> but

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
sorts of different edges this one is but

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.300 
sorts of different edges this one is but
then<00:04:54.300> I<00:04:54.420> also<00:04:54.600> have<00:04:54.960> like<00:04:55.200> a<00:04:55.440> squeegee<00:04:55.890> works

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
then I also have like a squeegee works

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.190 
then I also have like a squeegee works
really<00:04:56.550> cool<00:04:56.880> you<00:04:57.630> know<00:04:57.660> if<00:04:57.840> I<00:04:57.930> wanted<00:04:58.140> to

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
really cool you know if I wanted to

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.790 
really cool you know if I wanted to
squeegee<00:04:58.560> off

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
squeegee off

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.800 
squeegee off
here<00:05:01.800> you<00:05:02.460> know<00:05:02.580> a<00:05:02.790> squeegee<00:05:03.180> is<00:05:03.390> totally

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
here you know a squeegee is totally

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.440 
here you know a squeegee is totally
awesome<00:05:04.080> tool<00:05:04.470> with<00:05:04.980> a<00:05:05.550> lot<00:05:06.000> of<00:05:06.030> these<00:05:06.270> are

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
awesome tool with a lot of these are

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:07.610 
awesome tool with a lot of these are
like<00:05:06.600> a<00:05:06.630> dollar<00:05:06.840> like<00:05:07.290> they're<00:05:07.470> really

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
like a dollar like they're really

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:13.190 
like a dollar like they're really
inexpensive<00:05:11.540> get<00:05:12.540> a<00:05:12.570> totally<00:05:12.900> different

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
inexpensive get a totally different

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.420 
inexpensive get a totally different
texture

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
texture

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:24.909 
texture
I<00:05:14.490> can<00:05:14.880> add<00:05:17.120> weight

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:33.529 

texture<00:05:31.310> so<00:05:32.310> when<00:05:32.550> that<00:05:32.729> dries<00:05:33.030> it's<00:05:33.389> gonna

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539 
texture so when that dries it's gonna

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:37.219 
texture so when that dries it's gonna
talk<00:05:33.720> a<00:05:33.750> really<00:05:34.320> wedged<00:05:35.720> surface<00:05:36.720> because<00:05:37.050> it

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:37.229 
talk a really wedged surface because it

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:39.379 
talk a really wedged surface because it
dried<00:05:38.039> like<00:05:38.190> that<00:05:38.370> so<00:05:38.520> then<00:05:38.669> when<00:05:38.820> I<00:05:38.850> add<00:05:39.150> even

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:39.389 
dried like that so then when I add even

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:41.300 
dried like that so then when I add even
more<00:05:39.509> patina<00:05:40.020> it<00:05:40.259> could<00:05:40.440> do<00:05:40.530> the<00:05:40.680> thing<00:05:41.190> with

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
more patina it could do the thing with

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.279 
more patina it could do the thing with
my<00:05:41.460> fingertip<00:05:42.030> you're<00:05:42.270> siding<00:05:42.539> more<00:05:42.870> texture

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:43.289 
my fingertip you're siding more texture

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:46.729 
my fingertip you're siding more texture
more<00:05:43.500> layers<00:05:43.710> more<00:05:44.009> layers<00:05:44.250> more<00:05:44.490> layers
