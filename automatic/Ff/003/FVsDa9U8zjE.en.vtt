Chapter<00:00:21.660> four<00:00:21.990> we<00:00:23.090> talked<00:00:24.090> about<00:00:26.510> the

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
Chapter four we talked about the

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.730 
Chapter four we talked about the
kinematics<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.619> objects<00:00:30.740> undergoing

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
kinematics of objects undergoing

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.250 
kinematics of objects undergoing
circular<00:00:32.369> motion<00:00:32.759> we<00:00:32.910> said<00:00:33.149> when<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.390> car<00:00:34.230> is

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
circular motion we said when a car is

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.639 
circular motion we said when a car is
going<00:00:34.800> or<00:00:34.980> around<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.180> circle<00:00:36.780> or<00:00:36.960> any<00:00:37.020> other

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
going or around the circle or any other

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.400 
going or around the circle or any other
object<00:00:38.059> even<00:00:39.059> if<00:00:39.360> its<00:00:39.540> speed<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:40.140> not<00:00:40.350> changing

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
object even if its speed is not changing

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.090 
object even if its speed is not changing
we<00:00:41.160> said<00:00:41.430> no<00:00:41.850> we<00:00:41.879> said<00:00:42.239> that<00:00:42.450> it's<00:00:42.719> still

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
we said no we said that it's still

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.049 
we said no we said that it's still
accelerating<00:00:44.100> right<00:00:45.230> and<00:00:46.940> it's<00:00:47.940> a

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
accelerating right and it's a

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.000 
accelerating right and it's a
centripetal<00:00:48.480> acceleration<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.440> V<00:00:49.649> squared

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
centripetal acceleration is V squared

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.750 
centripetal acceleration is V squared
over<00:00:50.129> R<00:00:50.510> and<00:00:51.590> then<00:00:52.590> we<00:00:52.739> said<00:00:52.980> on<00:00:53.129> top<00:00:53.399> of<00:00:53.579> that

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
over R and then we said on top of that

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.160 
over R and then we said on top of that
if<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.239> has<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.449> tangential<00:00:55.199> acceleration

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
if it has a tangential acceleration

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.430 
if it has a tangential acceleration
maybe<00:00:58.170> it's<00:00:58.469> accelerating<00:01:00.320> along<00:01:01.320> the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
maybe it's accelerating along the

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.349 
maybe it's accelerating along the
tangential<00:01:01.890> direction<00:01:02.309> then<00:01:02.609> therefore<00:01:02.940> it

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
tangential direction then therefore it

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.789 
tangential direction then therefore it
has<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.570> total<00:01:04.080> acceleration<00:01:06.020> that<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.290> at<00:01:07.560> an

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
has a total acceleration that is at an

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.550 
has a total acceleration that is at an
angle<00:01:08.010> like<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:08.460> right<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.869> in<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.110> chapter

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
angle like that right so in that chapter

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.490 
angle like that right so in that chapter
we<00:01:10.950> analyzed<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.939> kinematics<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:12.900> circular

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
we analyzed the kinematics of circular

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.230 
we analyzed the kinematics of circular
motion<00:01:13.530> because<00:01:13.860> we<00:01:14.280> weren't<00:01:14.520> worried<00:01:15.060> as

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
motion because we weren't worried as

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.380 
motion because we weren't worried as
much<00:01:15.570> about<00:01:15.960> what<00:01:16.740> are<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.040> forces<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.939> are

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
much about what are the forces that are

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.210 
much about what are the forces that are
causing<00:01:18.990> this<00:01:19.170> thing<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.619> go<00:01:19.770> in<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.979> circle

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
causing this thing to go in a circle

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.730 
causing this thing to go in a circle
right<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.509> in<00:01:21.659> this<00:01:21.780> chapter<00:01:22.020> we<00:01:22.229> talk<00:01:22.560> about

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
right so in this chapter we talk about

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.770 
right so in this chapter we talk about
what<00:01:23.189> are<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.460> forces<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:23.939> are<00:01:24.150> causing

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
what are the forces that are causing

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.980 
what are the forces that are causing
this<00:01:25.740> motion<00:01:26.280> in<00:01:26.729> most<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.360> examples<00:01:27.659> that

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
this motion in most of the examples that

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.899 
this motion in most of the examples that
we<00:01:28.170> will<00:01:28.350> do<00:01:28.530> we<00:01:28.950> will<00:01:28.979> assume<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.549> the

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
we will do we will assume that the

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.840 
we will do we will assume that the
tangential<00:01:30.420> acceleration<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:31.320> zero<00:01:31.650> so<00:01:32.250> we'll

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
tangential acceleration is zero so we'll

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.289 
tangential acceleration is zero so we'll
assume<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.509> object<00:01:33.900> is<00:01:34.020> going<00:01:34.290> around<00:01:34.799> a

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
assume that the object is going around a

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:38.030 
assume that the object is going around a
uniform<00:01:36.299> circular<00:01:36.509> motion<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:37.350> we<00:01:37.619> will<00:01:37.799> just

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
uniform circular motion and we will just

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.980 
uniform circular motion and we will just
concentrate<00:01:39.030> on<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.540> centripetal

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
concentrate on the centripetal

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.260 
concentrate on the centripetal
acceleration<00:01:41.000> so<00:01:43.220> we're<00:01:44.220> going<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.460> say<00:01:44.670> the

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
acceleration so we're going to say the

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.899 
acceleration so we're going to say the
when<00:01:46.110> an<00:01:46.259> object<00:01:46.649> is<00:01:46.799> going<00:01:47.340> around<00:01:47.640> the

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
when an object is going around the

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.010 
when an object is going around the
circle<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:49.020> sum<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.909> forces<00:01:50.909> on<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.570> must

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
circle the sum of the forces on it must

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:59.929 
circle the sum of the forces on it must
be<00:01:52.259> equal<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.860> MV<00:01:53.579> squared<00:01:53.970> over<00:01:54.090> R<00:01:58.250> okay<00:01:59.250> some

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
be equal to MV squared over R okay some

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.730 
be equal to MV squared over R okay some
of<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.149> forces<00:02:00.390> on<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:00.840> must<00:02:01.079> be<00:02:01.229> equal<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.530> MV

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
of the forces on it must be equal to MV

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.130 
of the forces on it must be equal to MV
squared<00:02:02.009> over<00:02:02.100> R<00:02:02.520> so<00:02:02.759> pretty<00:02:03.299> much<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:03.689> first

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
squared over R so pretty much this first

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.959 
squared over R so pretty much this first
half<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.500> this<00:02:04.680> chapter<00:02:04.920> we<00:02:05.700> deal<00:02:05.939> with

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
half of this chapter we deal with

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.510 
half of this chapter we deal with
different<00:02:06.810> kinds<00:02:07.170> of<00:02:07.259> circular<00:02:07.829> motion<00:02:07.860> that

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
different kinds of circular motion that

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.960 
different kinds of circular motion that
are<00:02:09.149> caused<00:02:09.479> by<00:02:09.629> different<00:02:09.780> forces<00:02:10.970> for

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
are caused by different forces for

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.350 
are caused by different forces for
example<00:02:12.000> you<00:02:12.750> could<00:02:12.930> have<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:13.140> string

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
example you could have a string

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.679 
example you could have a string
and<00:02:17.010> an<00:02:18.010> object<00:02:18.459> at<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:18.700> end<00:02:18.730> of<00:02:19.060> a<00:02:19.120> string<00:02:19.480> and

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:19.689 
and an object at the end of a string and

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:22.080 
and an object at the end of a string and
you<00:02:20.470> could<00:02:20.620> be<00:02:20.709> turning<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.189> string<00:02:21.489> maybe<00:02:21.879> at

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
you could be turning the string maybe at

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.339 
you could be turning the string maybe at
an<00:02:22.209> angle<00:02:22.599> even<00:02:23.099> and<00:02:24.099> the<00:02:25.170> object<00:02:26.170> is<00:02:26.260> going

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
an angle even and the object is going

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:31.770 
an angle even and the object is going
around<00:02:26.769> the<00:02:26.950> circle<00:02:27.129> like<00:02:27.519> this<00:02:27.760> and<00:02:30.780> you

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
around the circle like this and you

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.089 
around the circle like this and you
could<00:02:31.989> you<00:02:32.109> should<00:02:32.290> be<00:02:32.379> able<00:02:32.470> to<00:02:32.620> analyze<00:02:33.069> that

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
could you should be able to analyze that

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.429 
could you should be able to analyze that
for<00:02:33.579> example<00:02:33.790> if<00:02:34.120> you're<00:02:34.269> given<00:02:34.659> the<00:02:34.870> velocity

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:35.439 
for example if you're given the velocity

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:37.949 
for example if you're given the velocity
of<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.159> object<00:02:36.189> and<00:02:36.790> its<00:02:37.150> mass<00:02:37.390> you<00:02:37.659> should<00:02:37.870> be

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
of the object and its mass you should be

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.319 
of the object and its mass you should be
able<00:02:38.019> to<00:02:38.140> find<00:02:38.319> the<00:02:38.500> angle<00:02:38.950> here<00:02:39.280> or<00:02:39.489> if<00:02:40.209> you're

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329 
able to find the angle here or if you're

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:42.059 
able to find the angle here or if you're
given<00:02:40.659> the<00:02:40.750> angle<00:02:40.870> you<00:02:41.650> should<00:02:41.829> be<00:02:41.920> able<00:02:41.980> to

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
given the angle you should be able to

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.300 
given the angle you should be able to
find<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.459> velocity<00:02:43.140> or<00:02:44.140> if<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.829> a<00:02:44.859> problem

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
find the velocity or if the a problem

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.190 
find the velocity or if the a problem
asks<00:02:45.640> you<00:02:45.760> for<00:02:45.790> the<00:02:46.030> period<00:02:46.480> of<00:02:46.659> the<00:02:46.810> motion

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
asks you for the period of the motion

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.080 
asks you for the period of the motion
you<00:02:47.709> should<00:02:47.889> be<00:02:47.980> able<00:02:48.040> to<00:02:48.159> find<00:02:48.370> its<00:02:48.549> period<00:02:48.909> so

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
you should be able to find its period so

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.390 
you should be able to find its period so
either<00:02:49.510> way<00:02:50.819> so<00:02:51.819> that's<00:02:52.030> the<00:02:52.920> that's<00:02:53.920> a<00:02:54.069> string

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
either way so that's the that's a string

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.160 
either way so that's the that's a string
type<00:02:54.670> of<00:02:54.700> situation<00:02:55.420> another<00:02:55.750> kind<00:02:56.079> of

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
type of situation another kind of

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.819 
type of situation another kind of
situation<00:02:56.709> is<00:02:56.859> like<00:02:57.040> a<00:02:57.069> car<00:02:57.459> going<00:02:57.849> around<00:02:58.090> the

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
situation is like a car going around the

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:03.509 
situation is like a car going around the
a<00:02:59.829> turn<00:03:01.230> the<00:03:02.230> car<00:03:02.500> could<00:03:02.709> be<00:03:02.799> going<00:03:02.980> around<00:03:03.340> the

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
a turn the car could be going around the

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.520 
a turn the car could be going around the
turn<00:03:03.760> on<00:03:04.389> unbanked<00:03:05.379> curve<00:03:06.189> and<00:03:07.290> let's<00:03:08.290> say<00:03:08.409> the

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
turn on unbanked curve and let's say the

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.160 
turn on unbanked curve and let's say the
car<00:03:08.739> is<00:03:08.769> coming<00:03:09.730> out<00:03:09.909> at<00:03:10.150> you<00:03:10.329> here<00:03:10.569> so<00:03:10.900> we're

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
car is coming out at you here so we're

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.339 
car is coming out at you here so we're
looking<00:03:11.500> at<00:03:11.650> a<00:03:11.680> end<00:03:12.400> view<00:03:12.670> here<00:03:13.060> I<00:03:13.299> should<00:03:14.139> draw

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
looking at a end view here I should draw

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:18.539 
looking at a end view here I should draw
the<00:03:14.409> tires<00:03:14.799> this<00:03:15.159> way<00:03:16.919> let's<00:03:17.919> say<00:03:18.129> the<00:03:18.280> car<00:03:18.519> is

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
the tires this way let's say the car is

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.509 
the tires this way let's say the car is
coming<00:03:19.060> out<00:03:19.209> towards<00:03:19.690> you<00:03:19.949> making<00:03:20.949> a<00:03:21.069> turn<00:03:21.280> and

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
coming out towards you making a turn and

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:30.180 
coming out towards you making a turn and
then<00:03:21.639> going<00:03:21.879> back<00:03:22.060> in<00:03:22.389> see<00:03:28.709> okay<00:03:29.709> so<00:03:29.769> the<00:03:30.010> car

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
then going back in see okay so the car

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.189 
then going back in see okay so the car
is<00:03:30.280> going<00:03:30.430> like<00:03:30.609> that<00:03:30.790> at<00:03:31.030> the<00:03:31.150> top<00:03:31.419> this<00:03:32.019> will

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:32.199 
is going like that at the top this will

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:34.740 
is going like that at the top this will
be<00:03:32.349> a<00:03:32.379> side<00:03:32.769> view<00:03:32.799> this<00:03:33.760> is<00:03:33.970> actually<00:03:34.389> this<00:03:34.510> we

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
be a side view this is actually this we

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.619 
be a side view this is actually this we
could<00:03:34.900> call<00:03:35.049> this<00:03:35.139> a<00:03:35.199> front<00:03:35.590> view<00:03:35.889> and<00:03:36.569> this<00:03:37.569> is

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:37.629 
could call this a front view and this is

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:41.220 
could call this a front view and this is
the<00:03:37.989> rear<00:03:38.199> view<00:03:39.389> the<00:03:40.389> top<00:03:40.659> view<00:03:40.900> will<00:03:41.079> look

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
the rear view the top view will look

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:49.260 
the rear view the top view will look
like<00:03:41.409> this

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.450 

this<00:03:50.270> will<00:03:50.480> be<00:03:50.600> a<00:03:50.630> top<00:03:50.870> view<00:03:50.900> of<00:03:51.350> what<00:03:52.130> the<00:03:52.250> car

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:52.460 
this will be a top view of what the car

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.430 
this will be a top view of what the car
is<00:03:52.490> doing<00:03:52.610> right<00:03:53.180> so<00:03:53.360> we<00:03:53.930> might<00:03:54.110> ask<00:03:54.260> a

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
is doing right so we might ask a

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.920 
is doing right so we might ask a
question<00:03:54.830> such<00:03:55.100> as<00:03:55.340> if<00:03:56.300> the<00:03:56.540> static

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
question such as if the static

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.690 
question such as if the static
coefficient<00:03:57.140> of<00:03:57.590> friction<00:03:58.010> between<00:03:58.040> the<00:03:58.490> car

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
coefficient of friction between the car

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.450 
coefficient of friction between the car
and<00:03:58.880> the<00:03:58.970> road<00:03:59.000> is<00:03:59.210> let's<00:03:59.870> say<00:04:00.020> 0.8<00:04:00.470> how<00:04:01.160> fast

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:01.460 
and the road is let's say 0.8 how fast

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.390 
and the road is let's say 0.8 how fast
can<00:04:01.700> the<00:04:01.820> car<00:04:02.030> go<00:04:02.680> what's<00:04:03.680> the<00:04:03.800> maximum<00:04:04.130> that

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
can the car go what's the maximum that

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.230 
can the car go what's the maximum that
it<00:04:04.670> can<00:04:04.850> go<00:04:05.000> before<00:04:05.240> it<00:04:05.930> starts<00:04:06.380> to<00:04:06.440> slide<00:04:07.210> okay

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:08.240 
it can go before it starts to slide okay

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.780 
it can go before it starts to slide okay
then<00:04:09.170> I<00:04:09.200> can<00:04:09.560> take<00:04:09.710> that<00:04:09.950> car<00:04:10.190> and<00:04:10.220> put<00:04:10.550> it<00:04:10.670> on<00:04:10.760> a

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
then I can take that car and put it on a

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:22.060 
then I can take that car and put it on a
bank<00:04:11.120> or<00:04:11.420> a<00:04:11.600> curve<00:04:12.250> like<00:04:13.250> this<00:04:13.490> and<00:04:20.739> I<00:04:21.739> can<00:04:21.920> ask

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
bank or a curve like this and I can ask

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.330 
bank or a curve like this and I can ask
the<00:04:22.220> same<00:04:22.430> question<00:04:22.910> I<00:04:23.590> can<00:04:24.590> say<00:04:24.740> now<00:04:24.920> how<00:04:25.100> fast

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
the same question I can say now how fast

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.240 
the same question I can say now how fast
can<00:04:25.610> he<00:04:25.640> go<00:04:26.140> before<00:04:27.140> it<00:04:27.230> begins<00:04:27.470> to<00:04:27.620> slide<00:04:27.950> and

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
can he go before it begins to slide and

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.790 
can he go before it begins to slide and
then<00:04:28.520> you'll<00:04:28.670> see<00:04:28.910> over<00:04:29.000> there<00:04:29.270> that<00:04:29.800> there

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
then you'll see over there that there

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.770 
then you'll see over there that there
will<00:04:30.890> be<00:04:30.920> a<00:04:31.040> cushion<00:04:31.520> of<00:04:31.640> values<00:04:32.390> that<00:04:32.570> it<00:04:32.750> can

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
will be a cushion of values that it can

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.820 
will be a cushion of values that it can
go<00:04:33.110> at<00:04:33.820> so<00:04:34.820> this<00:04:35.480> is<00:04:35.750> a<00:04:35.780> this<00:04:36.260> is<00:04:36.380> the<00:04:36.440> this<00:04:36.770> is

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
go at so this is a this is the this is

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.680 
go at so this is a this is the this is
the<00:04:37.010> kind<00:04:37.160> of<00:04:37.460> this<00:04:37.580> is<00:04:37.760> one<00:04:37.940> kind<00:04:38.150> this<00:04:38.390> is<00:04:38.540> of

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
the kind of this is one kind this is of

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.780 
the kind of this is one kind this is of
car<00:04:39.020> and<00:04:39.290> then<00:04:39.500> another<00:04:39.740> one<00:04:40.040> it<00:04:40.250> so<00:04:40.400> those<00:04:40.610> are

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
car and then another one it so those are

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.910 
car and then another one it so those are
that's<00:04:40.970> called<00:04:41.240> the<00:04:41.330> bank<00:04:41.600> curve<00:04:42.230> then<00:04:42.890> the

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:42.920 
that's called the bank curve then the

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.280 
that's called the bank curve then the
other<00:04:43.190> type<00:04:43.490> of<00:04:43.520> circular<00:04:44.330> motion<00:04:44.390> will<00:04:44.840> do<00:04:45.050> is

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
other type of circular motion will do is

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.910 
other type of circular motion will do is
like<00:04:45.860> vertical<00:04:46.460> circular<00:04:47.060> motion<00:04:47.090> like<00:04:47.660> a

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:47.920 
like vertical circular motion like a

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.130 
like vertical circular motion like a
railroad<00:04:48.970> like<00:04:49.970> a<00:04:50.000> rollercoaster<00:04:50.480> I<00:04:50.840> mean

colossus ride in Magic Mountain this
this<00:05:07.640> kind<00:05:07.940> of<00:05:08.060> rollercoaster<00:05:08.840> ride<00:05:09.020> is<00:05:09.290> one

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
this kind of rollercoaster ride is one

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.620 
this kind of rollercoaster ride is one
where<00:05:09.830> you<00:05:10.010> always<00:05:10.220> stay<00:05:10.850> on<00:05:10.880> top<00:05:11.330> of<00:05:11.510> the

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
where you always stay on top of the

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.280 
where you always stay on top of the
track<00:05:12.520> okay<00:05:13.520> like<00:05:14.000> this<00:05:14.270> so<00:05:14.900> I'll<00:05:15.110> ask

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.290 
track okay like this so I'll ask

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.010 
track okay like this so I'll ask
questions<00:05:15.860> such<00:05:16.130> as<00:05:16.160> how<00:05:17.090> what's<00:05:17.450> the<00:05:17.570> maximum

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
questions such as how what's the maximum

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.990 
questions such as how what's the maximum
velocity<00:05:18.290> that<00:05:18.950> the<00:05:19.100> roller-coaster<00:05:19.460> can

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
velocity that the roller-coaster can

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.600 
velocity that the roller-coaster can
have<00:05:20.210> there<00:05:20.770> what's<00:05:21.770> the<00:05:21.830> maximum<00:05:22.280> it<00:05:22.580> can

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
have there what's the maximum it can

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.380 
have there what's the maximum it can
have<00:05:22.910> there<00:05:23.320> if<00:05:24.320> it<00:05:24.950> has<00:05:25.190> half<00:05:25.520> that<00:05:25.730> velocity

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.390 
have there if it has half that velocity

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.930 
have there if it has half that velocity
what<00:05:26.570> will<00:05:26.750> your<00:05:26.930> apparent<00:05:27.350> weight<00:05:27.590> be<00:05:27.860> if<00:05:28.730> it

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
what will your apparent weight be if it

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.670 
what will your apparent weight be if it
has<00:05:29.060> one-third<00:05:29.540> of<00:05:29.720> that<00:05:29.780> velocity<00:05:30.110> what<00:05:30.500> will

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 
has one-third of that velocity what will

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.440 
has one-third of that velocity what will
your<00:05:30.830> apparent<00:05:31.190> weight<00:05:31.370> be<00:05:31.610> you<00:05:32.180> know<00:05:32.270> all

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
your apparent weight be you know all

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.900 
your apparent weight be you know all
kinds<00:05:32.930> of<00:05:33.140> variety<00:05:33.800> of<00:05:33.830> questions<00:05:34.400> on<00:05:34.640> that

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
kinds of variety of questions on that

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.050 
kinds of variety of questions on that
then<00:05:35.900> there's<00:05:36.230> the<00:05:36.410> revolution<00:05:37.190> type

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
then there's the revolution type

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.680 
then there's the revolution type
rollercoaster<00:05:39.370> where<00:05:40.370> the<00:05:40.730> ride<00:05:41.090> goes<00:05:41.420> like

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
rollercoaster where the ride goes like

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:48.220 
rollercoaster where the ride goes like
this<00:05:41.930> and<00:05:42.230> this<00:05:43.040> one<00:05:43.280> is<00:05:43.430> inverted<00:05:45.460> and<00:05:47.230> it

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:48.230 
this and this one is inverted and it

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.620 
this and this one is inverted and it
goes<00:05:48.380> up<00:05:48.650> and<00:05:48.860> then<00:05:48.920> this<00:05:49.400> way<00:05:49.640> so<00:05:50.330> I'll<00:05:50.420> ask

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
goes up and then this way so I'll ask

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.750 
goes up and then this way so I'll ask
similar<00:05:50.930> questions<00:05:51.110> about<00:05:51.740> that<00:05:51.950> what's<00:05:52.700> the

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:52.760 
similar questions about that what's the

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:54.730 
similar questions about that what's the
fastest<00:05:53.300> it<00:05:53.480> should<00:05:53.750> go<00:05:53.900> there<00:05:54.140> was<00:05:54.530> the

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
fastest it should go there was the

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.680 
fastest it should go there was the
slowest<00:05:55.190> it<00:05:55.370> should<00:05:55.580> go<00:05:55.760> there<00:05:56.000> if<00:05:56.300> it<00:05:56.570> has

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.690 
slowest it should go there if it has

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.480 
slowest it should go there if it has
double<00:05:57.110> that<00:05:57.260> speed<00:05:57.590> what's<00:05:57.860> your<00:05:58.040> apparent

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
double that speed what's your apparent

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.190 
double that speed what's your apparent
weight<00:05:58.700> stuff<00:05:59.600> like<00:05:59.810> that

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:00.200 
weight stuff like that

your<00:07:11.930> feet<00:07:12.140> right<00:07:12.560> below<00:07:13.160> your<00:07:13.340> feet<00:07:13.520> and<00:07:14.090> then

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:14.330 
your feet right below your feet and then

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.240 
your feet right below your feet and then
you<00:07:14.480> should<00:07:14.570> see<00:07:15.020> that<00:07:15.590> the<00:07:15.800> normal<00:07:15.980> force

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:16.250 
you should see that the normal force

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:18.340 
you should see that the normal force
below<00:07:16.850> your<00:07:17.030> feet<00:07:17.180> is<00:07:17.330> changing<00:07:17.900> as<00:07:18.050> the

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:18.350 
below your feet is changing as the

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.110 
below your feet is changing as the
roller<00:07:18.680> coaster<00:07:19.160> is<00:07:19.220> doing<00:07:19.520> different<00:07:19.910> thing

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:20.120 
roller coaster is doing different thing

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.900 
roller coaster is doing different thing
right<00:07:20.440> then<00:07:21.440> take<00:07:21.650> a<00:07:21.680> timeline<00:07:22.280> of<00:07:22.310> that<00:07:22.520> and

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:22.910 
right then take a timeline of that and

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:24.790 
right then take a timeline of that and
then<00:07:23.030> plot<00:07:23.330> it<00:07:23.540> and<00:07:23.720> see<00:07:24.110> if<00:07:24.230> it<00:07:24.380> fits<00:07:24.410> the

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:24.800 
then plot it and see if it fits the

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:29.500 
then plot it and see if it fits the
equation<00:07:25.510> I'm<00:07:26.510> doing<00:07:26.750> extra<00:07:26.990> credit<00:07:28.510> okay

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:29.510 
equation I'm doing extra credit okay

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:30.850 
equation I'm doing extra credit okay
we'll<00:07:29.690> talk<00:07:29.840> about<00:07:29.900> it<00:07:30.230> later<00:07:30.350> we'll

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:30.860 
we'll talk about it later we'll

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:38.980 
we'll talk about it later we'll
negotiate<00:07:30.980> something

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:38.990 

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:42.529 

okay<00:07:39.990> so<00:07:40.370> let's<00:07:41.370> do<00:07:41.610> one<00:07:41.849> let's<00:07:42.150> start<00:07:42.240> out

00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:42.539 
okay so let's do one let's start out

00:07:42.539 --> 00:07:46.370 
okay so let's do one let's start out
with<00:07:42.569> a<00:07:42.750> string<00:07:43.110> type<00:07:43.379> of<00:07:43.409> situation
