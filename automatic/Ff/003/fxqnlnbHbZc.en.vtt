chance of it going to be very small it's

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.440 
chance of it going to be very small it's
going<00:01:09.070> to<00:01:09.130> be<00:01:09.190> super<00:01:09.490> Rick<00:01:09.910> it's<00:01:10.150> gonna<00:01:10.300> be

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
so snipers are skill where f you aim

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.500 
so snipers are skill where f you aim
when<00:02:00.610> you<00:02:00.700> do<00:02:00.820> an<00:02:00.940> attack<00:02:01.210> where<00:02:01.360> you're

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
when you do an attack where you're

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.180 
when you do an attack where you're
aiming<00:02:01.690> holding<00:02:02.260> down<00:02:02.380> Z<00:02:02.680> and<00:02:02.830> then<00:02:02.920> doing

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
aiming holding down Z and then doing

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.710 
aiming holding down Z and then doing
something<00:02:03.370> you're<00:02:03.790> damaged<00:02:04.090> but<00:02:04.240> goes<00:02:04.390> up<00:02:04.570> by

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
like twenty percent i think so that's

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.430 
like twenty percent i think so that's
pretty<00:02:07.000> useful<00:02:07.210> skill<00:02:07.690> with<00:02:07.930> twenty<00:02:08.259> percent

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
pretty useful skill with twenty percent

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.510
