00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:11.450

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.180
 I want offstage for now 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.850
 you quickly manicure french like me 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:19.849
 I do at home I once exhibited a photo 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.009
 in instagram and some girls me 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:26.029
 asked to show really everything 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:28.279
 very simple i will use 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:32.029
 special strips me so much 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:36.230
 simpler it turns out easier and now I 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:38.930
 I'll show you everything in stages 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.840
 means I will use if you 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.440
 interesting then keep watching and so 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:48.140
 before you do a manicure 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:51.020
 I painted my nails more precisely 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.079
 marigolds using such a tool with 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.829
 Ali Hanson Remuver removed the cuticle at 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:01.010
 care sticks and 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:06.409
 I will need here such a varnish 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:09.350
 the brand's lacquer was not very visible 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.869
 he has such a delicate pink color there 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.249
 he has my number 011 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:17.319
 Yes, it is very similar to the wrong shade of varnish 

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:20.810
 lacquer essay 

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:22.939
 called much much and that's very similar 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.959
 I like these likes by the way 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:29.810
 cool they will rise easily with them 

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:33.340
 work here and they hold me too 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:38.240
 well enough it means we will have 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:40.759
 the main color and tip of the nail to white 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.770
 I will use this white lacquer 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.639
 the easiest I have no swarm 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.039
 only 

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:49.159
 it's tight enough for me 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:52.249
 literally one layer because all the same 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.319
 it is better to cover the tip in one layer 

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:57.079
 it dried faster and that was not very 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:59.810
 so fat so you tapplock 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:02.539
 I like just the same for french 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:06.560
 I bought a manicure using it 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:07.700
 constantly further I will need the main 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.300
 on 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:14.730
 the culprit is these are the stripes 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.660
 for french manicure and I think you are all with 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.420
 they are familiar with 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.140
 Here it is these strips of this brand 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:25.020
 I really like I had different 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.630
 stripes here are the very best they are 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:31.470
 thin stripes in itself 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:34.020
 thin now I will try to show here 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:38.220
 in itself is a thin strip and 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:41.370
 some paper itself is very thin and glue 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.980
 on the reverse side there is little that is when you 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.350
 stick to the nail then shoot not 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.870
 traces of glue remain this is very important 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.050
 so not these strips are very 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.060
 I like it one more time so called 120 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.450
 I bought pieces here just in the usual 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.300
 a store where everything for nails is sold 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.130
 The first time I tried and if I was like 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.290
 Of course they will always find them 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:09.180
 take here and drying sasha look the same 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:12.330
 our final stage will be well 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:17.000
 let's get started first i'm nails 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.000
 varnish on two layers 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:42.390
 covered one layer now it dries and 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:45.230
 cover the second layer of feathers cover over 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.230
 second layer 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.129
 and again the house dry well 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.670
 I covered my legs with varnish for two 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:07.069
 layer now they have me dry well 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:10.250
 and we will continue to continue with you 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:15.950
 do french and now i'm gonna be these 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:21.320
 stripes to attach the edge of the nail to 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:25.010
 we leave a tip which I 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:28.060
 need you can vary as you 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:32.979
 want do you want to make a white tip 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:35.690
 smaller thinner or wider 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:43.150
 that is, at my discretion, here I am 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:43.150
 neatly glue stripes 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:08.660
 here somewhere in the corner for example ah 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.660
 here I am helping myself 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:15.310
 wand 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.310
 good to glue them 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.590
 that there is no lacquer 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:26.740
 I glued the stripes so neatly 

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:29.369
 and now I will tip the nail to free 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:32.249
 ukit edge which is not sealed with us 

00:05:29.369 --> 00:05:35.550
 paint white 

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:35.550
 Nenko city 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:25.740
 I put on my nails and now I'm waiting for 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:28.440
 this white lacquer dries a little for 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:30.600
 order to remove the stickers and not 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:34.200
 pull over the lacquer you need it 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:37.580
 a little dried up our dried up and and now 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:42.540
 I will neatly shoot these 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:46.680
 stripes as you can see not 

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:51.300
 no sticky light remains of the strip 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:54.020
 no glue despite having nails 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:59.850
 we were previously 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:07:01.470
 painted so now i have this whole thing 

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:04.920
 I will cut in drying 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:08.870
 from the sheriff on one layer to all 

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:08.870
 dried out well 

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:16.600
 literally in 2-3 minutes 

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:19.990
 nails will be dry 

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:34.270
 over the already finished version
