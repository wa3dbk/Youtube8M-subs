00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.829
 Michael bad combination 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:33.509
 next example 

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:37.829

 Billions 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.659

 that means we spend too much heat on how many earn 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.530
 instead of questions such as how can this be the most enjoyable we spend 

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:06.359
 a wheel 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.429
 what do we have left over when all the money is gone? 

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:13.499

 there it exchanges 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:47.900
 because in this wonderful yet small sign of hope 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:48.580
 imaging 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.539
 I have one here 

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:53.209
 Who wants to say paper? 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.859
 Real estate drawn completely fresh 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:58.149
 what would you give me for that? 

00:03:58.149 --> 00:04:00.819
 hundred euro 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.819
 no one now in Plattling all right before 

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:07.649
 Beware of Bora's glow 

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:10.209

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.840
 invisible hand of the market 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.490
 for Kentucky over comparison WILLBORN in the experts and a world account 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.820
 We do not understand ourselves, we need more to follow the truth 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:43.559
 say 

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:47.240
 Honestly, if I could make a hundred euros from paper I would 

00:04:47.239 --> 00:04:49.080
 because stand here 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.139

 what is the difference between a man with 7 million euros in the account 

00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:01.650
 and one with seven children 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.650
 but if we continue the euro 

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:09.680
 we will explain with the crisis there is no natural saturation 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.680
 in children, but you have to get rich first 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.689
 Rich is who knows he has enough 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:18.719
