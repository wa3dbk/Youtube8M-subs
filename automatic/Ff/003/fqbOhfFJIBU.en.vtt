00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:02.149 

today<00:00:00.719> I<00:00:00.750> thought<00:00:01.050> we<00:00:01.199> take<00:00:01.350> a<00:00:01.380> look<00:00:01.589> at<00:00:01.860> the

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
today I thought we take a look at the

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:03.439 
today I thought we take a look at the
bridge<00:00:02.490> on<00:00:02.760> the<00:00:02.879> Oasis<00:00:03.179> of<00:00:03.270> the<00:00:03.330> Seas

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
bridge on the Oasis of the Seas

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.480 
bridge on the Oasis of the Seas
sometimes<00:00:04.440> I'm<00:00:04.589> tempted<00:00:04.740> to<00:00:04.920> call<00:00:05.160> it<00:00:05.339> the

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
sometimes I'm tempted to call it the

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.150 
sometimes I'm tempted to call it the
bridge<00:00:05.970> of<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.270> Starship<00:00:06.569> Enterprise

bridge of the Starship Enterprise

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.589 
bridge of the Starship Enterprise
because<00:00:08.160> it's<00:00:08.309> almost<00:00:08.460> as<00:00:08.790> sophisticated

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599

different it puts in traffic that might
be<00:01:21.210> around<00:01:21.420> us<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:22.229> again<00:01:22.409> on<00:01:22.530> one<00:01:22.710> display<00:01:23.130> you

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
be around us so again on one display you

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.950 
be around us so again on one display you
have<00:01:23.400> pretty<00:01:23.820> much<00:01:23.909> all<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.299> information<00:01:24.330> you

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
have pretty much all the information you

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.050 
have pretty much all the information you
really<00:01:25.110> need<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.650> understand<00:01:26.159> what's<00:01:26.970> going

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
decimeters which is actually just just

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.220 
decimeters which is actually just just
inches<00:03:01.370> which<00:03:02.180> again<00:03:02.540> is<00:03:02.659> amazing<00:03:02.780> when<00:03:03.169> you

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
inches which again is amazing when you

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.439 
inches which again is amazing when you
think<00:03:03.260> of<00:03:03.560> the<00:03:03.650> overall<00:03:03.739> size<00:03:04.250> of<00:03:04.639> the<00:03:05.030> Oasis

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:05.449

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
of the Seas well I hope you'll agree

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.770 
of the Seas well I hope you'll agree

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
the Seas is is quite remarkable but this

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.369 
the Seas is is quite remarkable but this

is just a small small part of the ship
this<00:03:16.010> is<00:03:16.189> an<00:03:16.280> amazing<00:03:16.909> creation<00:03:17.239> and<00:03:17.750> it's<00:03:18.319> all

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
this is an amazing creation and it's all

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.140 
this is an amazing creation and it's all
started<00:03:18.919> in<00:03:19.040> Turku<00:03:19.370> Finland<00:03:19.759> so<00:03:19.879> we<00:03:19.939> thought

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
started in Turku Finland so we thought

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.159 
started in Turku Finland so we thought
you'd<00:03:20.299> like<00:03:20.419> to<00:03:20.569> get<00:03:20.659> a<00:03:20.720> little<00:03:20.959> bit<00:03:21.049> of<00:03:21.109> a

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:21.169 
you'd like to get a little bit of a

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:22.719

I<00:04:09.680> think<00:04:10.010> 250<00:04:10.640> the<00:04:11.090> close<00:04:11.390> to<00:04:11.540> 300<00:04:11.989> years<00:04:12.400> when

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.469 
passed my mind at that time that it
might<00:04:51.500> be<00:04:51.710> one<00:04:51.889> day<00:04:52.130> interesting<00:04:52.820> to<00:04:53.090> be

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:53.479 
might be one day interesting to be

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:59.550 
might be one day interesting to be
involved<00:04:54.080> in<00:04:54.200> shipbuilding

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.170 
Royal Caribbean was the first one really

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.010 
Royal Caribbean was the first one really
said<00:05:03.100> let's<00:05:03.580> make<00:05:03.850> a<00:05:03.910> tailor-made<00:05:04.510> cruise

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
said let's make a tailor-made cruise

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.650 
said let's make a tailor-made cruise
ship<00:05:05.260> and<00:05:05.500> then<00:05:06.190> it<00:05:06.340> just<00:05:06.580> happens<00:05:07.030> out<00:05:07.270> that

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
ship and then it just happens out that

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.590 
ship and then it just happens out that
our<00:05:07.840> company<00:05:08.680> a<00:05:08.890> Royal<00:05:09.670> Caribbean<00:05:09.820> came<00:05:10.420> to

our company a Royal Caribbean came to
back<00:05:10.780> together<00:05:11.110> and<00:05:11.440> they're<00:05:11.920> thinking<00:05:12.130> it

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
back together and they're thinking it

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.990 
back together and they're thinking it
worked<00:05:14.290> well<00:05:14.620> from<00:05:14.860> the<00:05:14.980> very<00:05:15.160> beginning<00:05:15.700> to

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
worked well from the very beginning to

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.010 
worked well from the very beginning to
develop<00:05:16.240> this<00:05:16.900> type<00:05:17.290> of<00:05:17.590> Rhoda's<00:05:18.220> which<00:05:18.520> is<00:05:18.700> so

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
develop this type of Rhoda's which is so

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.690 
develop this type of Rhoda's which is so
challenging<00:05:20.020> so<00:05:20.290> demanding<00:05:20.980> so<00:05:21.220> many<00:05:21.460> new

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.700 
challenging so demanding so many new

challenging so demanding so many new
features<00:05:22.390> it<00:05:23.110> has<00:05:23.380> really<00:05:23.740> made<00:05:24.130> a<00:05:24.400> tremendous

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
features it has really made a tremendous

the maritime cluster in Finland employs

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.930 
the maritime cluster in Finland employs
about<00:05:37.690> twenty<00:05:38.320> thousand<00:05:38.770> I<00:05:38.980> think<00:05:39.460> everybody

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
about twenty thousand I think everybody

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.920 
about twenty thousand I think everybody
deep<00:05:40.240> inside<00:05:40.690> feels<00:05:41.110> really<00:05:41.770> proud<00:05:42.010> about
