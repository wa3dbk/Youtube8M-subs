00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.370 
i have found and it might just be my bag
from<00:01:41.040> storing<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.630> can<00:01:42.810> see<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.079> or<00:01:43.350> not

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
from storing it you can see that or not

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.590 
from storing it you can see that or not
it<00:01:43.649> has<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:43.920> little<00:01:44.369> bit<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.700> crease<00:01:45.180> in<00:01:45.450> it

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
it has a little bit of a crease in it

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.719 
it has a little bit of a crease in it
it's<00:01:45.780> like<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:45.990> base<00:01:46.350> on<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.890> just<00:01:47.460> kind<00:01:47.670> of

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
it's like the base on it just kind of

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.429 
it's like the base on it just kind of
wants<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.030> fold<00:01:48.299> in<00:01:48.479> half<00:01:48.689> but<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:48.960> think<00:01:49.229> once

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
wants to fold in half but I think once

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.020 
wants to fold in half but I think once
you<00:01:49.560> start<00:01:49.829> stuffing<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.430> with<00:01:50.460> stuff<00:01:50.759> again

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
you start stuffing it with stuff again

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.719 
you start stuffing it with stuff again
that<00:01:51.240> it'll<00:01:51.420> actually<00:01:51.600> go<00:01:51.990> down<00:01:52.140> now<00:01:52.729> I

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
that it'll actually go down now I

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.130 
that it'll actually go down now I
brought<00:01:53.970> some<00:01:54.119> stuff<00:01:54.240> here<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.630> show<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:54.899> what

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.249 
brought some stuff here to show you what

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.610 
that you could fit more things in I
would<00:03:03.060> almost<00:03:03.269> say<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.569> Allison<00:03:04.230> if<00:03:04.349> you<00:03:04.470> can

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
would almost say the Allison if you can

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.470 
would almost say the Allison if you can
see<00:03:04.980> inside<00:03:05.250> it<00:03:05.400> has<00:03:05.459> the<00:03:05.909> same<00:03:06.120> amount<00:03:06.239> of

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
see inside it has the same amount of

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.140 
see inside it has the same amount of
pockets<00:03:06.900> as<00:03:07.079> the<00:03:07.200> Eloise<00:03:07.439> does<00:03:07.859> it<00:03:08.670> does<00:03:08.970> not

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
pockets as the Eloise does it does not

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.089 
pockets as the Eloise does it does not
have<00:03:09.389> the<00:03:09.480> magnetic<00:03:09.989> size<00:03:10.230> but<00:03:10.530> it<00:03:10.620> does<00:03:10.799> have

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
have the magnetic size but it does have

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.430 
have the magnetic size but it does have
a<00:03:11.129> little<00:03:11.430> pocket<00:03:11.609> like<00:03:11.909> right<00:03:12.120> here<00:03:12.450> but<00:03:13.319> if

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
a little pocket like right here but if

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.500 
a little pocket like right here but if
you<00:03:13.590> notice<00:03:14.280> it's<00:03:14.669> a<00:03:15.209> bigger<00:03:15.480> body<00:03:15.870> bag<00:03:16.260> and<00:03:16.620> it

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
you notice it's a bigger body bag and it

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.180 
you notice it's a bigger body bag and it
you<00:03:18.510> can<00:03:18.690> actually<00:03:18.989> I<00:03:19.290> mean<00:03:19.560> it<00:03:19.680> just<00:03:19.829> kind<00:03:20.129> of

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
you can actually I mean it just kind of

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.399 
you can actually I mean it just kind of
expands<00:03:21.169> where<00:03:22.169> the<00:03:22.459> Eloise<00:03:23.459> one<00:03:24.030> it<00:03:24.959> really

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:25.409 
expands where the Eloise one it really

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:27.319 
expands where the Eloise one it really
doesn't<00:03:25.980> and<00:03:26.159> if<00:03:26.340> you<00:03:26.459> stuff<00:03:26.730> it<00:03:26.760> too<00:03:27.150> much

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
doesn't and if you stuff it too much

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.319 
doesn't and if you stuff it too much
it's<00:03:27.810> almost<00:03:28.590> hard<00:03:29.099> to<00:03:29.190> closed<00:03:29.639> a<00:03:29.879> lot<00:03:30.090> and

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
it's almost hard to closed a lot and

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.149 
it's almost hard to closed a lot and
then<00:03:30.510> it<00:03:30.599> really<00:03:30.840> does<00:03:31.139> bulge<00:03:31.560> up<00:03:31.829> a<00:03:31.919> little

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:32.159 
then it really does bulge up a little

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:36.199 
then it really does bulge up a little
bit<00:03:32.340> I<00:03:33.169> love<00:03:34.169> them<00:03:34.319> both<00:03:34.349> um<00:03:34.889> I<00:03:35.489> think<00:03:35.669> both

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209
