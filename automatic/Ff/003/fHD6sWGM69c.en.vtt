00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.690
 welcome 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.540
 in this video I'll demonstrate 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.540
 to create a website with visual studio 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:12.899
 2010 

00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:15.349
 let's call visual studio 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:18.349
 start 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.039
 once the 2010 studio 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.130
 he is going to carry 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.019
 I'm a little bit and I'm recording 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.000
 bye lost some performance 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.110
 I go here 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.010
 working with a smaller area also 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.720
 for 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.989
 reduce with good final file size 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:49.100
 started 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.100
 I'm on tour 2010 open conditions 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.470
 I want to create a website 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.410
 very simple 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.050
 sparring 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.390
 thousand 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.390
 the sweetener 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.980
 come on 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.180
 again was to mention 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.180
 I'm going to waste a little time and resizing mans 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.590
 to have a final file of the year 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.380
 good guys 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.910
 first thing 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.610
 on the website 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.570
 ah no then 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.250
 that the option for you to create 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.390
 Web site 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.270
 This one is the threat and you 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.960
 How can I do it? 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.330
 the ANA 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.340
 without any content 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.940
 this first option 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.130
 already has some content for you like for example 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.620
 a file the ricky cast 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.640
 and a home page 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.000
 This one from atp to the site 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.900
 without any agreement with pine 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.820
 and this on no homepage 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.670
 item the option of a webservice 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.070
 the foundation is a citation 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.460
 how can I say 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.190
 Good is a punch. 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.300
 this is a site geared towards 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.809
 a human being 

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:12.159
 here is a site for communication 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:14.849
 in programs and machines 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.690
 so with the webservice I could for example 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.039
 having a smartphone and connecting to the site 

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:25.739
 I could have multiple programs on different platforms connecting the 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.959
 your website and downloading darts 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:29.959
 touch 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.230
 so we can make them fade away from those not all 

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:37.009
 that can be accessed by other programs 

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:40.009
 in our case we will use the first option 

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:44.539
 what we are going to create sites for humans 

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:46.079
 I have to too 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.009
 the vanessa teaching option 

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:51.199
 here is the flamengo I'm going to work on 

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:53.799
 two points 03 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:58.670
 drill 3 drill 3 drill 2 drill the other and you will find 

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:00.869
 greater portability 

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:04.249
 on web servers today 

00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:05.810
 the tre-sp other five 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.689
 Are you already meeting? 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:09.549
 in four points 0 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.099
 It's not some reminding us that we're in the 

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:16.089
 for example I think the pads 

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:19.089
 of viseu medicine with the year 2011 

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:21.639
 It will be around today. 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:24.459
 nor 5 2011 something like this 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.389
 so at this time we still have a framework was death 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:30.579
 two points and 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:32.379
 as the main prison 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.229
 when I made the choice it was my 4 

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:38.229
 note that it will increase the number of projects 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.349
 so let's go back to the 2 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:45.249
 we just want a website like 

00:03:45.249 --> 00:03:47.839
 we have the option 

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:49.619
 can find it 

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:52.839
 through a letter that would have a strain or 

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:56.129
 the local file system 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:58.399
 and here we can also 

00:03:58.399 --> 00:04:00.549
 until say 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:01.569
 ap 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:04.339
 the way the project will be 

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:05.819
 only who 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.819
 This is the name of the project here. 

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:14.729
 to 01 

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:17.729
 I'll create 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.729
 cool 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.349
 created a class 

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:25.210
 a zero point for your 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.440
 this is such a succession project 

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:32.960
 one solution can have multiple subprojects 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.190
 in this case they only have in common about the project here is a site 

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:38.900
 notice 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.930
 if two points / 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.949
 means I'm not using 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:46.319
 the internet informed my uncle 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:47.409
 I know 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:50.080
 and I'll make it to your own visual studio 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.080
 for him there's no way these people 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:56.669
 I have to start page 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:00.740
 created here has a code home page 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.219
 touch 

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:06.150
 well what I have more here 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.620
 1 or heber 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.999
 to an inmate of the site configuration 

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:14.420
 At first this edu trusts and it comes 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.349
 weak enke has almost no configuration 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:20.929
 but with the passage of time we will increase the decision is of the conviviality 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:24.129
 to be able to have the settings 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:25.319
 for example 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:28.789
 let's say you publish your server served your server 

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:30.490
 North American 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.150
 I played ma, then just watch 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.159
 You can put a tag in here. 

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:37.349
 is to force 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:38.639
 the tongue 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:42.349
 - fulfilling our website culture 

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:44.930
 like pt br for example 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:45.939
 Lastly 

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:49.970
 in this configuration file we will learn along and from our 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.009
 video classes 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:53.080
 which will be paid 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.910
 Another interesting thing I said that this peaches patch 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.029
 is a page is not 

00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:02.029
 is that main page of fire 

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:05.759
 sound studio or ces art 

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:07.699
 he david 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:09.900
 it is the police to have consistency 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.779
 of visual studio k 

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:13.789
 ah 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:15.830
 it will split your page 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.849
 in two files 

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:20.849
 here i have little html 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:25.110
 here i have my code fund 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.930
 then the one that the source code 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.930
 and the one that is my hp and ibm 

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:35.869
 ah paulo 

00:06:35.869 --> 00:06:38.740
 Let's go to the site 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.849
 I forget 

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:42.610
 the price you're saying 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.740
 He's telling me not to trust me. 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.779
 will undergo some changes among other things 

00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:50.779
 some reconfiguration of it 

00:06:52.689 --> 00:06:55.909
 I forgot this detail, I'm not 

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:58.330
 working only with the part of my screen 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.389
 so I'm going to you 

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:01.919
 take a test here now 

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:05.169
 if he charged internet says tori autarch gothic 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.319
 here since the site is 

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:11.529
 separate from folk point the phfias is the standard of murder 

00:07:12.539 --> 00:07:15.539
 right-click exeni source code 

00:07:16.599 --> 00:07:19.649
 this agreement with source generated 

00:07:19.649 --> 00:07:22.849
 for the end 

00:07:22.849 --> 00:07:24.649
 the detailed 

00:07:24.649 --> 00:07:26.129
 the aspirant 

00:07:26.129 --> 00:07:28.849
 she is going to write 

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:29.800
 codes 

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.319
 that will generate html the client that the client is worth 

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:34.460
 have access to 

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:35.649
 html 

00:07:35.649 --> 00:07:37.020
 javascript 

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:40.020
 some ajax stuff 

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:43.430
 even for our 

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:44.810
 next to the side
