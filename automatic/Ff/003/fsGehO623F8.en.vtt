00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 hello everyone with you alex gamer and 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.549
 today we will unpack the wireless 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.770
 headset 20 for playstation I will say right away 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.139
 what headphone selection I am very very 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.969
 picky but I was rescued by my friend and 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.009
 colleague james by grober who 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.230
 advised me when explained headphones 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.029
 Now I suggest to go to the review 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.100
 and tell you about all the virtues 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.380
 Headsets must first be noted 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.320
 on the question who ask absolutely everything 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.869
 what is the difference between gold headphone version 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.830
 from the usual this yes actually nothing 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.560
 only by price 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.420
 my version is cheaper by 1500 rubles 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.489
 This is due to the fact that sales of gold 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.989
 jaw version before sales usual here 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.360
 perhaps all no technical 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.640
 difference is not present probably start 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.010
 From the box it is not the usual size 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.360
 represents a particular interest on 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.930
 boxes we see that headset 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.789
 compatible with ps4 ps3 and ps vita with 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.610
 back side we see the description on 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.590
 different languages ​​including Russian 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.530
 it says that the headset is compatible yet 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.910
 And SPK Mag we mobile devices 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.090
 also supports the virtual function 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.559
 sound 71 is here absolutely indicated 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.229
 all the advantages but we'll talk about it 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.229
 very soon and so now I suggest 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.460
 go open the box opening and 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.460
 we see another pair 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:19.140
 She is of course much more stylish and 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.420
 than the previous it is made of dense 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.890
 cardboard and only one by one or outside 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.350
 mind can guess what's inside 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.780
 it's all very, very cool what 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.820
 same check actually inside of us 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.680
 expect a personal headset 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.540
 we have to get rid of the dust of ethylene 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.110
 and cardboards that are so tightly wrapped 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.110
 earphone 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.410
 not so here in front of us flaunts herself 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.180
 headset but what for does not suggest that 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.090
 this is not all the equipment 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.360
 I, in general, was right inside us 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.120
 waiting for 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.430
 little black box inside of us we 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.460
 see the vital elements of headphones 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.750
 namely the wire for charging via usb 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.850
 wire to connect for now or 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.990
 mobile phone here is some semblance of a flash drive 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.150
 actually a connector for 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.250
 there is also a wireless connection 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.270
 pouch symbolism to hold all 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.450
 of these charms 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.490
 and of course, where to start without them 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.350
 perhaps with comfort here present 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.800
 very fashion to this day yes and comfortable 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.170
 option 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.730
 headphones can be folded in half 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.590
 speaker is very convenient when 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.000
 After all, the headset is transporting many 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.790
 Headphones do not allow this 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.830
 sometimes even smart japanese breaks 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.510
 designers did not allow this 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.350
 headphones can be customized for 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.080
 every head 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.120
 the speakers move independently of 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.980
 headboard headphones themselves seemed to me 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.050
 very comfortable and respect to use 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.540
 they weigh little and do not press at all 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.980
 head still have to say about the sound quality 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.900
 headphones sound 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.970
 volumetric and supported as on 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.190
 console so she is not yet mobile 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.060
 devices it is impossible to describe it 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.280
 need to hear 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.500
 for example played in battlefield 4 i was 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.330
 very surprised that I could hear with 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.430
 which side gave strong shots and 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.130
 right and left as is usually the case with 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.590
 headphones and front to back and so on 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.450
 the sound its quality just surpassed all 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.040
 my expectations now I will talk about 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.470
 compatibility with devices and 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.739
 connection as u could understand the headset 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:15.590
 Suitable for while ps3 and ps4 and ps vita 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.209
 also for mac and mobile devices 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.070
 I know how with a mat ok while you can 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.989
 connect with a cable or 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.269
 wirelessly just that's who 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.610
 black usb flash drive on 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.560
 playstation 4 connect similar 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.540
 through the connector we now take a closer look 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.209
 Headphones have a few buttons 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.100
 include surround word this 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.680
 the option is automatically enabled also 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.600
 adjusting the sound in the game charging data 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.440
 Headphones last for about the whole day. 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.540
 using 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.550
 their in succession to takes about 2 hours 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.440
 microphone is also present using 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.600
 which is important to communicate in a network game 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.820
 also present itself as a sort of button 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.500
 listening in the manual unfortunately 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.270
 There is no clear explanation why she 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.340
 intended so i didn't 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.080
 go into details when you click 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.030
 nothing happens front side 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.040
 there is a button for adjusting the sound in 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.080
 chat and also turn off 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.190
 Headphones in general, this is all for 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.380
 technical part 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.120
 our review is coming to an end and completion 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.160
 I wanted to advise everyone to purchase these 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.010
 because the headphones first you get 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.080
 beautiful surround sound format 71 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.950
 secondly it will be very comfortable and convenient 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.080
 to wear 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.820
 and move well with them and 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.320
 third you get full compatibility 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.850
 sony consoles 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.520
 as well as a wireless connection 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.720
 playstation and bye and mac compatibility 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.790
 and mobile device 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.400
 what could be better especially for 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.680
 a modest price of 4500 rubles which 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.720
 most likely this will fall over time 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.210
 the headset is absolutely not inferior 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.680
 more expensive analog say from 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.290
 razer or logitek 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.360
 discard all doubts and acquire 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.400
 you will definitely not regret it all with you
