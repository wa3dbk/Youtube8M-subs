00:01:47.339 --> 00:01:47.349 
locking snips a couple of screws the

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:49.559 
locking snips a couple of screws the
little<00:01:47.590> screws<00:01:47.859> er<00:01:47.889> for<00:01:48.279> the<00:01:48.340> body<00:01:48.549> this<00:01:49.299> big

00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:49.569 
little screws er for the body this big

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:52.889 
little screws er for the body this big
screw<00:01:49.869> here<00:01:50.169> is<00:01:50.649> for<00:01:50.919> the<00:01:51.009> cylinder<00:01:51.490> and<00:01:51.899> a

00:01:55.019 --> 00:01:55.029 
couple of other screws which more likely

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:58.080 
couple of other screws which more likely
for<00:01:55.179> this<00:01:55.299> one<00:01:55.479> here<00:01:55.749> you'd<00:01:56.669> put<00:01:57.669> it<00:01:57.759> with<00:01:57.999> the

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
for this one here you'd put it with the

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.309 
for this one here you'd put it with the
screw<00:01:58.299> in<00:01:58.359> the<00:01:58.419> middle<00:01:58.539> so<00:01:58.840> that<00:01:58.959> way<00:01:59.109> if<00:01:59.200> you

00:01:59.309 --> 00:01:59.319 
screw in the middle so that way if you

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:01.580 
screw in the middle so that way if you
need<00:01:59.439> to<00:01:59.619> you<00:01:59.709> can<00:01:59.829> adjust<00:01:59.919> it<00:02:00.310> up<00:02:00.489> and<00:02:00.969> down

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
need to you can adjust it up and down

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.499 
need to you can adjust it up and down
okay<00:02:02.590> so<00:02:02.770> it's<00:02:03.130> a<00:02:03.219> very<00:02:03.429> straightforward<00:02:03.969> type

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
okay so it's a very straightforward type

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:06.749 
okay so it's a very straightforward type
of<00:02:04.659> lock<00:02:04.810> I'm<00:02:05.409> noticing<00:02:05.709> here<00:02:06.009> the<00:02:06.189> cutouts

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
of lock I'm noticing here the cutouts

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:08.940 
of lock I'm noticing here the cutouts
haven't<00:02:07.119> been<00:02:07.239> cut<00:02:07.450> out<00:02:07.630> this<00:02:08.560> is<00:02:08.739> the<00:02:08.860> way

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
haven't been cut out this is the way

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.529 
haven't been cut out this is the way
that<00:02:09.099> come<00:02:09.280> this<00:02:09.459> is<00:02:09.580> the<00:02:09.610> only<00:02:09.849> way<00:02:10.060> they<00:02:10.270> come

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
that come this is the only way they come
