00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
often than not and that was the essence

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.590 
often than not and that was the essence
of<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.530> combat<00:00:46.860> system<00:00:47.090> and<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.120> was<00:00:48.390> pretty

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
of the combat system and that was pretty

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.900 
of the combat system and that was pretty
much<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.840> leap<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.170> faith<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.590> know<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:50.250> can<00:00:50.760> we

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
much a leap of faith you know I can we

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.240 
much a leap of faith you know I can we
do<00:00:50.969> this<00:00:51.180> perhaps<00:00:51.840> we<00:00:52.469> don't<00:00:52.649> know<00:00:52.739> let's<00:00:53.100> try

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
do this perhaps we don't know let's try

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.220 
do this perhaps we don't know let's try
it<00:00:53.370> see<00:00:53.730> what<00:00:53.850> happens<00:00:54.149> we're<00:00:54.840> now<00:00:54.930> nine

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
it see what happens we're now nine

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.560 
it see what happens we're now nine
iterations<00:00:55.920> down<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.280> road<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:57.149> that's<00:00:57.390> the

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
iterations down the road and that's the

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.119 
iterations down the road and that's the
main<00:00:57.719> impact<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.170> so<00:00:58.379> how<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:58.680> control<00:00:59.070> it

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
main impact you so how you control it

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.910 
main impact you so how you control it
with<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.460> with<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.270> different<00:01:00.629> directions<00:01:01.050> how

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
with a with the different directions how

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.920 
with a with the different directions how
the<00:01:01.980> GUI<00:01:02.340> or<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.820> graphic<00:01:03.180> user<00:01:03.329> interface<00:01:03.480> is

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
the GUI or the graphic user interface is

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.450 
the GUI or the graphic user interface is
build<00:01:04.140> up<00:01:04.290> with<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.589> tabs<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.129> easy<00:01:05.250> access

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
build up with the tabs and easy access

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.260 
build up with the tabs and easy access
and<00:01:06.390> then<00:01:06.930> we<00:01:07.049> have<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.729> masive<00:01:08.729> challenge<00:01:09.119> is

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
and then we have a masive challenge is

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.910 
and then we have a masive challenge is
still<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.600> be<00:01:09.630> solve<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:10.140> course<00:01:10.350> but<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.799> was

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
still to be solve of course but that was

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.109 
still to be solve of course but that was
the<00:01:11.040> essence<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.700> that's<00:01:11.790> what's

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
the essence of it and that's what's

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.420 
the essence of it and that's what's
carried<00:01:12.360> through<00:01:12.600> today<00:01:12.869> yeah<00:01:13.740> may<00:01:14.130> just<00:01:14.369> to

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
carried through today yeah may just to

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.490 
carried through today yeah may just to
follow<00:01:14.610> up<00:01:14.700> on<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:15.090> little<00:01:15.240> bit<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:16.290> there

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
follow up on that a little bit is there

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.410 
follow up on that a little bit is there
concern<00:01:16.650> from<00:01:17.070> sort<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.850> more<00:01:18.030> hardcore

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
concern from sort of the more hardcore

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.130 
concern from sort of the more hardcore
PC<00:01:18.689> gamers<00:01:19.320> are<00:01:20.280> going<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.090> sort<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.720> see<00:01:21.930> that

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
PC gamers are going to sort of see that

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.530 
PC gamers are going to sort of see that
in<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.439> design<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:22.920> be<00:01:23.040> like<00:01:23.159> okay<00:01:23.700> I'm<00:01:23.909> not

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
in the design and be like okay I'm not

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.149 
in the design and be like okay I'm not
as<00:01:24.720> interested<00:01:25.080> in<00:01:25.110> this<00:01:25.229> game<00:01:25.409> as<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.590> pc<00:01:25.950> game

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
as interested in this game as a pc game

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.710 
as interested in this game as a pc game
because<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.460> feel<00:01:26.700> like<00:01:26.729> it's<00:01:27.030> more<00:01:27.299> built<00:01:27.540> for

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
because I feel like it's more built for

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.580 
because I feel like it's more built for
the<00:01:27.780> 360<00:01:28.259> never<00:01:28.500> never<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:29.009> mean<00:01:29.280> no<00:01:30.409> these<00:01:31.409> are

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
the 360 never never I mean no these are

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.490

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
the guys the grill panic yoland I think

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.890 
the guys the grill panic yoland I think
what<00:01:34.619> we<00:01:34.740> learned<00:01:34.770> from<00:01:35.159> that<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.520> that<00:01:35.900> don't

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
what we learned from that is that don't

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.510 
what we learned from that is that don't
give<00:01:37.259> your<00:01:37.470> players<00:01:37.740> all<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.070> choices<00:01:38.280> right
