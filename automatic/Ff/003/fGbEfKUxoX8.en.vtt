what<00:01:44.490> this<00:01:44.610> is<00:01:44.790> doing<00:01:44.939> is<00:01:45.119> it's<00:01:45.270> using<00:01:45.540> the

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
what this is doing is it's using the

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.569 
what this is doing is it's using the
accelerometer<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.409> other<00:01:46.680> stuff<00:01:47.009> inside<00:01:47.460> the

of course I've got to go through the

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.740 
of course I've got to go through the
standard<00:02:07.530> unlock<00:02:08.069> process<00:02:08.580> so<00:02:08.849> I<00:02:09.119> went<00:02:09.690> ahead

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
standard unlock process so I went ahead

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.880 
standard unlock process so I went ahead
and<00:02:09.869> made<00:02:09.989> sure<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.470> doesn't<00:02:10.770> happen

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
definitive answer about whether this is

a good thing or a bad thing as far as
battery<00:03:13.180> life<00:03:13.510> goes<00:03:13.780> but<00:03:14.230> my<00:03:14.260> general

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
battery life goes but my general

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.430 
battery life goes but my general
impression<00:03:15.069> is<00:03:15.640> it<00:03:16.299> seems<00:03:16.659> to<00:03:16.780> be<00:03:16.900> saving<00:03:17.290> some

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
impression is it seems to be saving some

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.210 
impression is it seems to be saving some
battery<00:03:17.829> life<00:03:18.120> when<00:03:19.120> I'm<00:03:19.269> using<00:03:19.450> it<00:03:19.690> in<00:03:19.900> a
