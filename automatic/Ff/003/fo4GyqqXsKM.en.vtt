00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
I'm going to go on his cue all right

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.280 
I'm going to go on his cue all right
okay<00:00:02.220> so<00:00:02.850> we're<00:00:03.030> going<00:00:03.120> to<00:00:03.210> go<00:00:03.330> inside<00:00:03.689> a<00:00:03.959> heart

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
okay so we're going to go inside a heart

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.530 
okay so we're going to go inside a heart
now<00:00:04.470> you<00:00:04.950> did<00:00:05.130> a<00:00:05.220> sagittal<00:00:05.759> cut<00:00:06.029> of<00:00:06.210> the<00:00:06.330> heart

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
now you did a sagittal cut of the heart

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.290 
now you did a sagittal cut of the heart
sorry<00:00:07.259> a<00:00:07.350> frontal<00:00:07.649> cut<00:00:08.010> of<00:00:08.130> the<00:00:08.220> heart<00:00:08.429> and<00:00:09.210> you

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
sorry a frontal cut of the heart and you

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.730 
sorry a frontal cut of the heart and you
will<00:00:09.450> divide<00:00:09.719> to<00:00:10.019> see<00:00:10.200> that<00:00:10.380> what's<00:00:10.559> inside

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
will divide to see that what's inside

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.039 
will divide to see that what's inside
the<00:00:11.670> first<00:00:11.940> thing<00:00:12.179> you'll<00:00:12.420> notice<00:00:12.570> here<00:00:12.960> is

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
the first thing you'll notice here is

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.590 
the first thing you'll notice here is
that<00:00:13.170> you<00:00:13.380> have<00:00:13.490> well<00:00:14.490> I<00:00:14.880> really<00:00:15.780> like<00:00:16.400> but

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:17.600 
that you have well I really like but

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.660 
that you have well I really like but
like<00:00:18.600> not<00:00:18.990> so<00:00:19.230> thick<00:00:19.590> wall<00:00:19.890> here<00:00:20.189> look<00:00:20.430> at<00:00:20.550> the

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
like not so thick wall here look at the

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.330 
like not so thick wall here look at the
size<00:00:20.939> of<00:00:21.210> this<00:00:21.390> goes<00:00:21.869> like<00:00:22.080> I<00:00:22.380> can<00:00:22.560> grab<00:00:23.010> with

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
size of this goes like I can grab with

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.060 
size of this goes like I can grab with
the<00:00:23.550> tweezers<00:00:24.390> here<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:25.350> look<00:00:25.619> at<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.830> size

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
the tweezers here and look at the size

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.349 
the tweezers here and look at the size
of<00:00:26.279> these<00:00:26.430> which<00:00:26.640> actually<00:00:27.060> have<00:00:27.150> it<00:00:27.269> to

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
of these which actually have it to

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.109 
of these which actually have it to
hyperextend<00:00:28.080> diffusers<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.710> grab<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:29.070> so<00:00:29.699> this

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
hyperextend diffusers to grab it so this

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.220 
hyperextend diffusers to grab it so this
wall<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:31.380> much<00:00:31.650> larger<00:00:32.070> than<00:00:32.219> this<00:00:32.579> one<00:00:32.940> here

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.230 
wall is much larger than this one here

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.959 
wall is much larger than this one here
based<00:00:34.230> on<00:00:34.500> that<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:34.980> know<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.460> this<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.820> the

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
based on that I know that this is the

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.990 
based on that I know that this is the
left<00:00:36.360> side<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.469> heart<00:00:37.620> just<00:00:37.950> because<00:00:38.850> the

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
left side of the heart just because the

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.670 
left side of the heart just because the
left<00:00:39.239> ventricle<00:00:39.780> has<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.050> work<00:00:40.140> harder<00:00:40.559> to

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
left ventricle has to work harder to

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.130 
left ventricle has to work harder to
pump<00:00:40.829> blood<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.399> entire<00:00:41.780> system<00:00:42.780> as

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
pump blood to the entire system as

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.720 
pump blood to the entire system as
opposed<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.649> this<00:00:43.860> one<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.219> just<00:00:44.399> pumps

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
opposed to this one that just pumps

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.490 
opposed to this one that just pumps
blood<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:46.190> the<00:00:47.190> ones<00:00:47.399> so<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.660> left<00:00:48.899> side<00:00:49.230> I

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
blood to the ones so in the left side I

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.490 
blood to the ones so in the left side I
see<00:00:49.770> these<00:00:50.100> flaps<00:00:50.520> here<00:00:50.989> one<00:00:51.989> big<00:00:52.230> flap

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
see these flaps here one big flap

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
I have this piece of flash here that is

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.219 
I have this piece of flash here that is
the<00:02:04.649> interventricular<00:02:05.310> septum<00:02:05.759> it's<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.960> major

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
the interventricular septum it's a major

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.190 
the interventricular septum it's a major
piece<00:02:07.649> of<00:02:07.710> flash<00:02:08.220> of<00:02:08.729> cardiac<00:02:09.660> muscle<00:02:09.750> that

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
piece of flash of cardiac muscle that

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.710 
piece of flash of cardiac muscle that
separates<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.830> two<00:02:11.009> chambers<00:02:11.220> of<00:02:12.120> course<00:02:12.540> on

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
separates the two chambers of course on

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.920 
separates the two chambers of course on
this<00:02:12.840> side<00:02:12.900> I'm<00:02:13.379> also<00:02:13.590> going

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
this side I'm also going

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.740 
this side I'm also going
have<00:02:14.049> valve<00:02:14.730> another<00:02:15.730> age<00:02:16.150> of<00:02:16.420> in<00:02:16.569> particular

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
have valve another age of in particular

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.160 
have valve another age of in particular
valve<00:02:17.200> this<00:02:18.040> one<00:02:18.250> has<00:02:18.430> three<00:02:18.670> cusps<00:02:19.120> and<00:02:19.239> this

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
valve this one has three cusps and this

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.190 
valve this one has three cusps and this
is<00:02:20.290> called<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:21.129> tricuspid<00:02:21.700> valve<00:02:22.150> it<00:02:22.900> also

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
is called the tricuspid valve it also

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.979 
is called the tricuspid valve it also
has<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:23.709> chordae<00:02:24.069> tendineae<00:02:24.459> to<00:02:24.760> it<00:02:24.909> and<00:02:25.120> on

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
has the chordae tendineae to it and on

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.860 
has the chordae tendineae to it and on
top<00:02:26.349> of<00:02:26.379> this<00:02:26.709> going<00:02:27.250> way<00:02:27.549> deep<00:02:27.879> there<00:02:28.180> would

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
top of this going way deep there would

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.479 
top of this going way deep there would
be<00:02:29.049> your<00:02:29.579> right<00:02:31.079> atrium<00:02:32.079> the<00:02:32.920> only<00:02:33.069> thing<00:02:33.250> left

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
be your right atrium the only thing left

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.199 
be your right atrium the only thing left
here<00:02:33.730> now<00:02:33.879> is<00:02:34.060> actually<00:02:34.209> finding<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:36.209> semi

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
here now is actually finding the semi

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:42.030 
here now is actually finding the semi
lunar<00:02:37.870> valves<00:02:38.439> so<00:02:39.099> I<00:02:39.159> go<00:02:39.400> in<00:02:39.549> the<00:02:40.290> left<00:02:41.290> atrial

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
lunar valves so I go in the left atrial

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.309 
lunar valves so I go in the left atrial
F<00:02:42.310> tentacle<00:02:42.849> again<00:02:43.090> and<00:02:43.659> I<00:02:43.750> look<00:02:43.840> at<00:02:44.019> the<00:02:44.109> very

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
F tentacle again and I look at the very

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.289 
F tentacle again and I look at the very
top<00:02:44.409> and<00:02:44.920> this<00:02:45.430> is<00:02:45.489> actually<00:02:45.819> hard<00:02:46.060> it's<00:02:46.209> going

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
top and this is actually hard it's going

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.119 
top and this is actually hard it's going
to<00:02:46.359> be<00:02:46.419> difficult<00:02:46.599> to<00:02:46.810> see<00:02:46.989> it<00:02:47.109> well<00:02:47.829> you<00:02:47.950> can

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129 
to be difficult to see it well you can

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:53.909 
to be difficult to see it well you can
see<00:02:48.340> this<00:02:48.549> structure<00:02:49.030> here<00:02:49.209> and<00:02:52.470> it<00:02:53.470> literally

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:53.919 
see this structure here and it literally

00:02:53.919 --> 00:03:00.619 
see this structure here and it literally
looks<00:02:54.310> like<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:58.000> the<00:02:58.959> flanks<00:02:59.439> of<00:02:59.530> a<00:02:59.799> butt<00:03:00.129> hole

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
looks like the the flanks of a butt hole

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:06.599 
looks like the the flanks of a butt hole
and<00:03:02.489> that's<00:03:03.489> right<00:03:03.790> semilunar<00:03:04.150> valve<00:03:05.040> so<00:03:06.040> this

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
and that's right semilunar valve so this

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.420 
and that's right semilunar valve so this
the<00:03:07.299> aortic<00:03:08.290> semilunar<00:03:08.590> valve<00:03:08.980> because<00:03:09.250> on

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
the aortic semilunar valve because on

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.300 
the aortic semilunar valve because on
the<00:03:09.549> left<00:03:09.760> side<00:03:10.030> the<00:03:11.040> pulmonary<00:03:12.040> semilunar

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
the left side the pulmonary semilunar

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.640 
the left side the pulmonary semilunar
valve<00:03:12.790> suppose<00:03:13.780> that<00:03:13.959> you<00:03:14.049> could<00:03:14.079> see<00:03:14.439> that

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
valve suppose that you could see that

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.629 
valve suppose that you could see that
here<00:03:15.069> on<00:03:15.340> the<00:03:15.609> left<00:03:16.379> on<00:03:17.379> the<00:03:17.560> right<00:03:17.709> ventricle

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:18.639 
here on the left on the right ventricle

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:20.069 
here on the left on the right ventricle
but<00:03:18.790> it's<00:03:18.909> very<00:03:19.030> difficult<00:03:19.299> on<00:03:19.629> that<00:03:19.780> kind<00:03:20.019> of

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
but it's very difficult on that kind of

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.119 
but it's very difficult on that kind of
cut<00:03:20.319> so<00:03:20.949> I<00:03:20.979> go<00:03:21.729> back<00:03:22.000> outside<00:03:22.329> and<00:03:22.900> I<00:03:23.709> get<00:03:23.769> to<00:03:24.010> my

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:24.129 
cut so I go back outside and I get to my

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:27.180 
cut so I go back outside and I get to my
pulmonary<00:03:24.609> trunk<00:03:24.879> which<00:03:25.329> is<00:03:25.479> an<00:03:25.599> artery<00:03:26.190> /

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
pulmonary trunk which is an artery /

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.069 
pulmonary trunk which is an artery /
that<00:03:27.489> open<00:03:27.909> and<00:03:28.150> I<00:03:28.209> can<00:03:28.449> see<00:03:29.729> deep<00:03:30.729> there<00:03:31.180> give

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
that open and I can see deep there give

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:36.719 
that open and I can see deep there give
you<00:03:32.169> time<00:03:32.470> to<00:03:32.769> focus<00:03:33.099> it<00:03:33.370> those<00:03:35.609> flanks<00:03:36.609> that

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:36.729 
you time to focus it those flanks that

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:38.399 
you time to focus it those flanks that
you<00:03:36.879> see<00:03:37.060> right<00:03:37.239> there<00:03:37.299> those<00:03:37.720> Falls<00:03:38.109> that<00:03:38.260> you

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:38.409 
you see right there those Falls that you

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:43.469 
you see right there those Falls that you
see<00:03:38.590> deep<00:03:38.829> there<00:03:39.099> are<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:41.310> semilunar<00:03:42.479> valves

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:43.479 
see deep there are the semilunar valves

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:45.780 
see deep there are the semilunar valves
the<00:03:43.659> pulmonary<00:03:44.139> semilunar<00:03:44.439> valves<00:03:45.009> it's<00:03:45.430> easy

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
the pulmonary semilunar valves it's easy

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.689 
the pulmonary semilunar valves it's easy
the<00:03:46.060> only<00:03:46.329> thing<00:03:46.509> that<00:03:46.659> is<00:03:46.780> deep<00:03:47.049> into<00:03:47.530> the

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:47.699 
the only thing that is deep into the

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:50.009 
the only thing that is deep into the
pulmonary<00:03:48.699> trunk<00:03:49.030> is<00:03:49.569> going<00:03:49.810> to<00:03:49.870> be<00:03:49.930> the

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
pulmonary trunk is going to be the

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.419 
pulmonary trunk is going to be the
semilunar<00:03:50.319> valve<00:03:51.280> that's<00:03:52.180> it
