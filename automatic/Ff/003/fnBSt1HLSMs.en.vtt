00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.809
 rock dotcom today I'm going to talk about 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.329
 how to choose a good hosting and in what 

00:00:28.809 --> 00:00:34.340
 problems you can get if you choose 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:37.280
 you have to take into account that there is a 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.460
 very big offer on the internet how 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.550
 choose a hosting who offer you 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.930
 unlimited emails offer you 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.060
 unlimited storage and we're going to 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.710
 start at that point can not be 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.650
 Unlimited is like someone sells you 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:55.220
 a house with unlimited rooms does not exist 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.899

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.730
 they sell like this with the intention that you 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.739
 buy because what they are giving you 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.170
 understand is that for the type of hosting 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.810
 that you are going to pay the type of clients that 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.119
 requires that hosting is never consumed the 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.259
 bandwidth then you have to take 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.119
 account that has bandwidth 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:12.950
