00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
check out the connectivity now there's

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.420 
check out the connectivity now there's
all<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.840> standard<00:01:55.229> ports<00:01:55.619> such<00:01:55.710> as<00:01:55.890> an<00:01:55.979> HDMI

output digital audio output but the big

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.090 
output digital audio output but the big
step<00:01:59.250> up<00:01:59.490> is<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.790> 7.1<00:02:00.479> analog<00:02:01.079> outputs<00:02:01.619> which

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
step up is the 7.1 analog outputs which

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.530 
step up is the 7.1 analog outputs which
are<00:02:02.250> really<00:02:02.460> important<00:02:03.060> because<00:02:03.119> this<00:02:03.360> is<00:02:03.420> a

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
are really important because this is a

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.929 
are really important because this is a
3d<00:02:03.990> blu-ray<00:02:04.259> player<00:02:04.710> what<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:05.610> means<00:02:05.790> is

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
3d blu-ray player what that means is

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.690 
3d blu-ray player what that means is
that<00:02:05.969> you'll<00:02:06.180> be<00:02:06.329> able<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.600> run<00:02:06.810> 3d<00:02:07.680> video<00:02:08.069> over

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
that you'll be able to run 3d video over

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.449 
that you'll be able to run 3d video over
the<00:02:08.819> HDMI<00:02:09.360> output<00:02:09.750> straight<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.349> a<00:02:10.530> 3d<00:02:11.009> TV

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
the HDMI output straight to a 3d TV

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.830 
the HDMI output straight to a 3d TV
and<00:02:11.939> you'll<00:02:12.060> be<00:02:12.120> able<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.359> run<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.659> audio

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
and you'll be able to run the audio

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.080 
and you'll be able to run the audio
straight<00:02:13.409> to<00:02:13.560> maybe<00:02:13.890> an<00:02:14.040> older<00:02:14.400> AV<00:02:14.700> receiver

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
straight to maybe an older AV receiver

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.229 
straight to maybe an older AV receiver
that<00:02:15.569> can't<00:02:15.870> handle<00:02:16.290> that<00:02:16.379> 3d<00:02:16.859> video<00:02:17.250> format

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
that can't handle that 3d video format

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:19.670 
that can't handle that 3d video format
so<00:02:18.450> it's<00:02:18.689> nice<00:02:18.870> as<00:02:19.019> you'll<00:02:19.140> be<00:02:19.170> able<00:02:19.290> to<00:02:19.500> take

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
so it's nice as you'll be able to take

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.619 
so it's nice as you'll be able to take
advantage<00:02:20.129> of<00:02:20.159> those<00:02:20.510> high-resolution<00:02:21.510> audio

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
advantage of those high-resolution audio

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.289 
advantage of those high-resolution audio
