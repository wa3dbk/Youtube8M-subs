it into our pan then we'll make a
rectangular<00:03:55.230> shape<00:03:55.650> so<00:03:55.920> we<00:03:55.950> can<00:03:59.570> cut<00:04:00.570> them

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
rectangular shape so we can cut them

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.210 
rectangular shape so we can cut them
into<00:04:00.900> bars<00:04:03.230> now<00:04:04.230> that<00:04:04.470> that<00:04:04.680> feels<00:04:04.920> just<00:04:05.160> like
