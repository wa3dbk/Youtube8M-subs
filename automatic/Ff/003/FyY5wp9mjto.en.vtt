00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.600 
extremely great on uh you know indoor
surfaces<00:02:08.039> because<00:02:08.940> they<00:02:09.119> said<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:09.509> when<00:02:09.660> you

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
surfaces because they said that when you

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.910 
surfaces because they said that when you
when<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:11.700> go<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:11.879> make<00:02:12.090> sharp<00:02:12.360> movement

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
when you go to make sharp movement

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.280 
when you go to make sharp movement
and<00:02:13.040> cuts<00:02:13.340> that<00:02:14.209> the<00:02:14.360> traction<00:02:14.660> pattern<00:02:15.020> it

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
and cuts that the traction pattern it

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.870 
and cuts that the traction pattern it
goes<00:02:15.770> all<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.010> way<00:02:16.099> up<00:02:16.310> to<00:02:16.459> here

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
goes all the way up to here

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.960 
goes all the way up to here
so<00:02:17.480> when<00:02:17.810> your<00:02:17.930> foot<00:02:18.200> rolls<00:02:18.700> there's<00:02:19.700> still

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
so when your foot rolls there's still

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.350 
so when your foot rolls there's still
traction<00:02:20.480> so<00:02:21.410> I<00:02:22.310> just<00:02:22.849> thought<00:02:23.000> this<00:02:23.150> was<00:02:23.330> a

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
traction so I just thought this was a

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.970 
traction so I just thought this was a
really<00:02:23.569> dope<00:02:23.750> Callaway<00:02:24.170> I<00:02:24.410> don't<00:02:24.800> plan<00:02:24.920> on

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
really dope Callaway I don't plan on

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.250 
really dope Callaway I don't plan on
getting<00:02:25.190> any<00:02:25.400> of<00:02:25.550> the<00:02:25.700> other<00:02:25.880> colorways<00:02:26.260> just

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
getting any of the other colorways just

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.410 
getting any of the other colorways just
because<00:02:27.560> I<00:02:29.560> just<00:02:30.560> don't<00:02:30.860> like<00:02:31.190> I'm<00:02:32.000> not<00:02:32.209> a<00:02:32.239> big

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
because I just don't like I'm not a big

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.930 
because I just don't like I'm not a big
fan<00:02:32.660> of<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:33.050> other<00:02:33.200> colorways<00:02:33.610> it's<00:02:34.610> a<00:02:34.730> cool

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
fan of the other colorways it's a cool

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.860 
fan of the other colorways it's a cool
shoe<00:02:35.350> but<00:02:36.350> this<00:02:36.530> does<00:02:37.489> Callaway<00:02:37.910> just<00:02:38.270> really

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
the inserts look like it's a little bit

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.080 
the inserts look like it's a little bit
different

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
different

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.789 
different

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
now the in shoot inside the shoe I don't

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.130 
now the in shoot inside the shoe I don't
know<00:03:30.890> you<00:03:31.340> can<00:03:31.489> see<00:03:31.640> that<00:03:31.880> but<00:03:32.570> it's<00:03:32.720> sort<00:03:33.019> of<00:03:33.079> a

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
know you can see that but it's sort of a

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.590 
know you can see that but it's sort of a
design<00:03:33.500> I<00:03:33.829> really<00:03:34.190> know<00:03:34.310> what<00:03:34.340> that<00:03:34.489> means<00:03:35.329> or

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
design I really know what that means or

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.810 
design I really know what that means or
what<00:03:35.750> it<00:03:35.810> stood<00:03:36.109> for<00:03:36.250> and<00:03:37.250> of<00:03:37.370> course<00:03:37.579> on<00:03:37.760> the

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
what it stood for and of course on the

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.690 
what it stood for and of course on the
back<00:03:38.000> of<00:03:38.150> the<00:03:38.239> tongue<00:03:38.480> it<00:03:38.720> has<00:03:38.900> a<00:03:38.930> signature

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
back of the tongue it has a signature

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.940 
back of the tongue it has a signature
and<00:03:40.989> I<00:03:41.989> just<00:03:42.230> thought<00:03:42.320> this<00:03:42.470> was<00:03:42.680> a<00:03:42.709> really

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
and I just thought this was a really

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.690 
and I just thought this was a really
dope<00:03:43.220> looking<00:03:43.519> Cola<00:03:43.760> way<00:03:45.400> maybe<00:03:46.400> I'll<00:03:46.579> even

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
dope looking Cola way maybe I'll even

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.870 
dope looking Cola way maybe I'll even

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:40.960 
me lengthwise true to size but this is
just<00:04:39.650> right<00:04:39.770> here<00:04:40.070> it's<00:04:40.250> just<00:04:40.430> really<00:04:40.729> tight

so I was really surprised about that I
was<00:04:42.979> even<00:04:43.130> actually<00:04:43.729> debating<00:04:44.120> on<00:04:44.210> whether

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
was even actually debating on whether

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.590 
was even actually debating on whether
going<00:04:44.840> up<00:04:44.900> to<00:04:45.050> the<00:04:45.139> size<00:04:45.320> 9<00:04:45.620> but<00:04:46.520> I<00:04:46.550> was<00:04:46.759> like<00:04:46.970> no

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
going up to the size 9 but I was like no

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:54.279
