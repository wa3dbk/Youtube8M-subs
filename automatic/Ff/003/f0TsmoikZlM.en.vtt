00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.860
 Now we're all going to talk to you today about 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:14.690
 headphones 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.100
 specifically we are going to teach the types of 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.980
 headphones that there are and why 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.710
 use so come on let's go to it 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.240
 and we start with the different forms 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.890
 of headphones that there are depending on 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.919
 how they position themselves in the ear 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.739
 first intervals that go inside the 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:32.750
 auditory pavilion super aura those who go 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:35.989
 above and civilians with mauro who 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.790
 they are the ones that occupy the whole good ear 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.559
 the introns the teachers are the ones 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:44.470
 They come with mp3 with phones 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.470
 mobile phones that are of this type 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.970
 of this type also depending good 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.280
 that gets inside the pavilion 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.920
 auditory and isolates a little more of the 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.470
 Exterior 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.810
 on the other hand 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.570
 super now they are of this type that 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.700
 they cover the ear 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.150
 but that they do not cover it by 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.890
 completely and they are good so now 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.110
 there are a lot of models of 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.170
 colors with a lot of very designs 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.610
 original and are ideal for 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.979
 use the headset as a 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.460
 Plug neutral and are then 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:23.220
 oral circles that are these that like 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.229
 You see they are quite large in size and 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.979
 what we get with them is that we 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:32.369
 occupy the entire ear we are also going to 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.670
 distinguish circles aura leds 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.619
 closed and open ones closed are 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.480
 those that are going to isolate us so much from the noise 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.940
 external as the internal 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.580
 that is for example surely there 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.350
 been on the subway and you are listening to the 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.450
 sound of the music you have at 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.700
 side those are open juries do not 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.659
 they would let out the sound besides good 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.219
 many times they also have systems 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.159
 elimination of blocking noise 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.499
 noise so that it does not bother us if we go 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.109
 in the subway the noise of the subway or by the 

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:06.149
 street people who are talking well 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:08.340
 they are usually in this type of 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.009
 headphones but 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.910
 Bo just got a model 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.820
 intraocular 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.710
 that has this technology and that also 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.540
 is that it completely blocks light from this 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.880
 video can also be configured to 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.130
 to let in something that is a little 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.620
 it's safer to go completely 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.720
 isolated from outside 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.210
 There are different types of cancellation of 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.820
 noise that is active cancellation and 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:36.550
 the passive passive is what we 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.640
 they offer, even though it is only their own 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.580
 headset when putting it insulates us 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.380
 of active noise because they are systems 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.150
 that they wear some headphones that in 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.760
 this can be seen perfectly is this 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.460
 button here and that when we what 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.040
 we put the islands of noise not what 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:56.140
 They cover everything because they are also more 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.370
 insurance but if it allows us to enjoy 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.319
 the music without that ambient noise 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.940
 we also have to distinguish why 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.920
 let's use the headset at the time 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.489
 to buy a model or another for 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:11.840
 example the djs are usually used circus 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:13.730
 murals more professional people 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.060
 for fashion themes can also be 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.849
 use the thresholds and then by 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:24.330
 example if we want to look we have here a 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:25.740
 super super nice example of yamaha 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.210
 is that this is used as a 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.830
 fashion complement this are not about 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.320
 headphones lately all 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.390
 headphones are being released with this 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.190
 aspect also be a complement 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.960
 fashionable apart from being used to 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.570
 listen to music then we can not 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.480
 find in different designs formats 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.310
 colors 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.110
 and for example if we are going to use them 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.430
 to play sports is silly 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.920
 neither one of these models 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.629
 even some traditional button 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.400
 they leave the auditory pavilion when we go 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:54.530
 running when we exercise 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.180
 that's why there are headphones especially 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.700
 designed for sports practice by 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.379
 example this is hook type it 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.100
 hold on the ear and by much 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:04.320
 movement that you make 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.630
 Well, the habits are not going to come out 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.640
 in other formats such as headbands as per 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.420
 example the life behind 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.110
 effective 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:15.239
 and good and one more tip if you go to 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.400
 use with the mobile phone to have in 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.230
 mind that it's going to be super super useful 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.430
 have a control of this type that 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.860
 allow not only control the 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.810
 reproduction but also that it serves as 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.430
 hands free so if they call you do not have 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.810
 what to remove a headset besides 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.570
 you usually do an audio quality 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.910
 exceptional to know if they are 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.620
 available on apple devices or 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.540
 for other types of smartphones we 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.150
 we have to fix on what the model is 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.889
 behind one and with that one and it will tell us that 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.650
 are ready for two devices 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:46.200
 for example to do and well I'm going to 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.690
 give you one last tip if you have glasses 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:52.139
 please do not take a pair of headphones 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.400
 supra oral or moral circus because if 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:55.950
 they are going to nail the whiskers in the 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.020
 ears that could not imagine is nothing 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.780
 comfortable and nothing practical if I go with 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.389
 of course, yes or no 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.220
 answer but meanwhile in my case 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:05.810
 that I know from experience and then 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.180
 we can find already in the last of what 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.820
 last we can find uses the 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.730
 headphones that go with two cables or 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.200
 only on one side are more comfortable 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.330
 then the one that leads only on one side 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.400
 because we are hooked to less and 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.620
 we also find another aspect of 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.780
 the wires that is that they can be kind 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.820
 rope or type post this normal that these 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.290
 you usually shoot more than you see that 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.540
 they are like a good cord because that is 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:31.430
 entangle least not even type 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:34.040
 zipper because he already says he is 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.590
 everywhere and to finish extras 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.030
 that usually comes in good sandra 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:40.550
 Spare pads is this type 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.710
 of pillows the headquarters in different 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:46.100
 sizes this why good because every 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:48.800
 motorcycle is a size of auditory pavilion 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:51.530
 then we are not worth the same too 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.479
 that we can have in like good extras 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.490
 things because it comes with a sleeve or that 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:57.590
 come as well as that as a kind of 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.400
 gps to protect them and take it without 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.249
 no problem 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.409
 what else do we have left, I think 

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:05.169
 you have not seen that there are a lot of 

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:06.949
 variety of headphones and sure 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:09.079
 here with the little ones that we have 

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:12.699
 counted seville which is your favorite 

00:06:09.079 --> 00:06:12.699
 so nothing to encourage them to tell
