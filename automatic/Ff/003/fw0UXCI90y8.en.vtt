 von hessen-kassel is still here 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.049
 not very clear I think in the 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.540
 offensive 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:19.460
 yes hello I'm the sebastian pick 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:22.980
 30 years old comes from the sv flieden and 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.170
 am in farah the ramp with 19 years old 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.750
 central midfield comes from lehmanns 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.539
 benjamin foot 24 years old right 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.170
 defender zfc meuselwitz marcel hein 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.210
 18 years old keeper hÃ¼nfelder sv rott 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.180
 training start borussia fulda with us 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.920
 peter endorf board with which 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.360
 Expectations or which before 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.610
 event starts on order 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.989
 yes, I'm looking forward to that huge 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.149
 starts today 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.340
 the beginning of the season now also with the 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.539
 Spielkarte der rauskam is the tension 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.100
 again a little further 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.680
 put up by being the first one 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.270
 play a derby against lehnerz 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.829
 I think that a game where we are very 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.300
 have worked for a long time 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.219
 actually last two years 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.449
 that the upper league is now with the game 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.729
 against and starts is one 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.630
 Giant motivation so by actually 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.350
 in the preparation nothing more 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.150
 go wrong 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.460
 the fight for the places has to be huge 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.810
 or I think that we will 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.150
 today again with the players 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.400
 talk a bit and I believe that the 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.560
 motivation is much higher than that 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.080
 last years because that's one now 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.659
 insane highlight is that we 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.900
 Just look forward to it if all is well 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.799
 he has just said to me running 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.950
 one-digit table space you go 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.540
 So the goal is already that we have one 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.670
 single-digit table space have ever 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.950
 after how good it may be 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.360
 but among the first five come that 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.829
 the preparation now decide how 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.040
 The team gets together like themselves 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.149
 to establish the whole new entrances and 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.799
 then we know after the 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.630
 first two three already play a game 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.820
 a little bit more where we stand well 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.659
 I already have a simple thigh 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.060
 seen here 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.500
 how is there the stand there is 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.079
 actually no current I stood 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.360
 knows that he is training today and that 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.850
 at the moment the current stood with us the 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.259
 Captain Marc Janko coach the right one 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.060
 words found around you in unto 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.530
 swear on the season yes I think 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.690
 I mean the short break was 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.880
 very short now 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.560
 although that went now four weeks 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.530
 I think they are all top motivated 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.330
 have a good team together and 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.710
 are looking forward to the first 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.940
 the first units but it will 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:26.180
 Of course, an intensive preparation 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:28.610
 not always so that every word so far 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.860
 Yes, I did say the uli 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.990
 is already known that the players 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.460
 14 but I'll say the success gives us 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.580
 Law 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:39.740
 and I think all grateful then if 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.120
 the last ten 15 minutes 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.650
 then the power to the games too 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.080
 turn and I believe that too in the 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.120
 Last season we often showed that 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.330
 recognize the leo and pons with us 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.680
 new entry from tsv lehnerz cruciate ligament tear 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.210
 until two weeks again in training 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.150
 molly I have heard 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.710
 uli said it looks better than 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.970
 you can already praise it 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:03.410
 slow down as his feeling so far 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.430
 everything feels very good 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:09.470
 so clearly here and there after tweaks from 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.880
 head here is yet no two fights 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.570
 I have not done anything yet 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.420
 a little bit afraid 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:18.050
 but I have final on friday 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.000
 Examinations and yes if the doctor then 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:23.030
 okay then I always have that from 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.540
 head on security and then I think 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.250
 times I can get started fully 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.140
 for naturally still warm to the upstroke 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.360
 against against the ex union 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.489
 there you are you totally fired up until then 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.630
 again, or yes I'm up 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:42.230
 each case hot and horny on the game and 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:44.030
 a great game and the preparation 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.450
 wait and then, hopefully, 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.450
