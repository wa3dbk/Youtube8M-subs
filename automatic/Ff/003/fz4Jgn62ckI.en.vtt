00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:09.059
 hello everyone with you jeff tag this 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.690
 another small rubric on my 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.790
 channel 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.440
 which I may due to give up after 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.360
 the first issue we can will 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.900
 to continue forevermore 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.240
 the eternal 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.789
 but generally get used to the uncertainty 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.769
 I live with her in the meantime 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.019
 this little lion show will be called 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.060
 just and simple to read and in 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.429
 I will periodically tell him 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.019
 to all people interested in this matter 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.149
 Well, that is most likely only your 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.850
 the second account on youtube which 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.170
 are my main fans 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.700
 Tell him hello about interesting 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.610
 field projects you guessed it 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.590
 I read that still zadrot and can 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.660
 advise a lot of books but it is in my 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.370
 too much for youtube so let's 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.100
 just start with good comics 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.440
 which you could miss not to notice 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.600
 or just do not know their existence in 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.280
 because the comic really comes out 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.020
 a lot of them translate into 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.059
 Russian language and follow them all 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.489
 only the bravest babies can 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.470
 By the way, I do not count myself wild and 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.170
 therefore I approach this question from the point 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.130
 view of a little dedicated person 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.080
 a stranger with a huge amount 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.830
 comics about the most popular 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.590
 superheroes 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.200
 their peripetia developmental rebirth 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.119
 my other is what I mean if you donâ€™t 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.860
 read comics last couple of years then 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.170
 go to make out all 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.030
 features of everyones there infinite crises 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.670
 various plot arches for batman 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.070
 supermen wolverine olk and rebirth 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.409
 restarts journey to the future so 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.720
 further and so on and so forth we are not 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.750
 We will have to dig into such details 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.009
 I damn do not have so much free time 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.689
 so pay attention to the new 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.640
 interesting series to get acquainted with 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.380
 who know practically nothing 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.810
 it is necessary and if something is necessary then I will give you 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.820
 tell and today I will introduce you to 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.290
 great comics dedicated to one of 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.649
 the most entertaining heroes of the universe 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.540
 Batman in general and all comics from 10 in 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.729
 particulars maybe you guessed it 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.799
 it's about the permanent component 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.719
 the joker of a talented girl is superb 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.939
 psychologists are just completely outraged 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.759

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.099

 change and miss quinzel 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.690
 finally earned her 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.270
 spicy comic book which she won't 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.280
 Share with either horrible ghost Gotham not 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.440
 with his painted bastard enemy 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.510
 Of course, the poor coffee house would not 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.850
 make of gotham without joker but events 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.280
 from the comic book already occurs after 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.230
 the evil clown dies while Harley herself 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.540
 wandering around the night in the garage 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.610
 littered with trash and communicates with great 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.550
 a stuffed beaver which as you understand 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.520
 is her imaginary talking with pleasure 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.530
 with us in general, this comic like many 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.140

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.440
 last year and taking advantage of such 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.860
 proximity to the mass of talented artists 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.690
 they decided to make the first more accurate 0 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.270
 Adventure release beauty harley 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.490
 just mind blowing for this they 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.170
 invited 17 artists each of 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.970
 which drew one page about 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.740
 harley quinn own style 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.050
 showing how she could have been 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.240
 certain circumstances in essence 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.310
 case 0 release is a wild 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.320
 brain removal and absolutely not necessary 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.450
 for acquaintance because something plot 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.090
 only happens on his last 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.070
 page or rather the poor remaining 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.600

 patients bequeathed and four-story 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.850
 building on horses horse harley island 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.550
 dreamed of owning a house and therefore 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.170
 having loaded the motorcycle with a pile of our things 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.300
 heroine goes to meet new 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.070
 impressions and discoveries from this 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.870
 in a big way the comic begins 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.330
 which at the time of recording 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.280
 so far there are in 7 full 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.380

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.330

 adult feed surprise completely 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.280
 devoid of any pretentious 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.830
 superheroic cuisine in style 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.530
 exalted batman or silly 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.840
 Spiderman plot plot is built 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.940
 on the fact that the building got the harley 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.410
 just fine and on its first floor 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.170
 there are various entertainment 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.670
 institutions on the second live faddish 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.340
 creatures that will happen a lot 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.620
 fun at the third is a warehouse 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.049
 and on the fourth and rooftop apartments 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.940
 new mistress unfortunately rent 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.609
 covers just over 50 percent 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.710
 monthly expenses and taxes mean 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.550
 Harley will have to take up his head to find 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.650
 the real 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.819
 bot be responsible oddly enough 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.669
 so she does 

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:32.349
 truth in its particular style position 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.180
 by the way complicated by the fact that for Harley 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:35.710
 some unknown villain has appointed 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.569
 a decent reward of two million 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.599
 dollars and now all the free mercenaries 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:42.340
 chasing her blue red scalp not 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:45.099
 so that our heroine could not 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.539
 deal with them but this problem too early 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:48.580
 or later have to decide 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:50.680
 perhaps for me this is one of the best 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.759
 recent comics he's light 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.310
 unobtrusive 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:56.080
 a lot of plot easy to understand and 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.819
 invariable defiant smile 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.770
 forcing you to believe that harley 

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:02.050
 is one of the nicest market 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.039
 Wonder adequate characters throughout 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.409

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:07.080
 from old acquaintances we will see here and and 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:09.759
 zac's usual poison ivy girlfriend 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.979
 which by the way also adds a general 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:14.319
 color in general spoiler is no longer 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:16.210
 I will read and advise everyone of course 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:18.520

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:26.710

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:28.870

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.060
 do something else busy probably well here 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.250
 I was slightly bothered by this question and on 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.380
 this moment also translated 4 now 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.900
 busy fifth and then eventually add 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.680
 6 7 and what else will they appear 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.340
 I liked 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:44.080
 walk and takes a lot of time 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:46.270

 people who do it professionally 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.789
 However, the quality of the translation I have to 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:51.310
 be no worse 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:52.180
