00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
I want to show you how to get a cast in

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:06.289 
I want to show you how to get a cast in
the<00:00:05.220> overworld<00:00:05.640> real<00:00:05.879> quick

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
the overworld real quick

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.390 
the overworld real quick
so<00:00:06.750> over<00:00:07.200> here<00:00:07.440> we<00:00:07.620> got<00:00:07.710> a<00:00:07.770> portal<00:00:08.160> in<00:00:08.280> the

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
so over here we got a portal in the

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.509 
so over here we got a portal in the
overworld<00:00:08.760> yeah<00:00:09.210> at<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.420> sky<00:00:09.740> and<00:00:10.740> in<00:00:11.219> the

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
overworld yeah at the sky and in the

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.039 
overworld yeah at the sky and in the
upper<00:00:11.759> corner<00:00:12.120> of<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.240> bottle<00:00:12.660> we<00:00:12.809> added

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
upper corner of the bottle we added

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.079 
upper corner of the bottle we added
rails<00:00:13.320> where<00:00:14.040> we<00:00:14.160> want<00:00:14.340> to<00:00:14.400> get<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.670> gas<00:00:14.849> out

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
rails where we want to get the gas out

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.810 
rails where we want to get the gas out
so<00:00:15.900> we<00:00:16.049> place<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.289> minecart<00:00:17.250> right<00:00:17.580> in<00:00:17.730> the

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
so we place a minecart right in the

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.580 
so we place a minecart right in the
corner<00:00:18.180> so<00:00:18.720> when<00:00:19.020> he<00:00:19.109> gets<00:00:19.289> through<00:00:19.410> the

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
corner so when he gets through the

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.320 
corner so when he gets through the
portal<00:00:19.890> he<00:00:19.949> we<00:00:20.100> get<00:00:20.400> picked<00:00:20.670> up<00:00:20.789> by<00:00:20.970> this<00:00:21.029> mine

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
portal he we get picked up by this mine

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.630 
portal he we get picked up by this mine
cart<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.810> get<00:00:22.050> transported<00:00:22.439> away<00:00:22.680> so<00:00:23.340> let's

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
cart and get transported away so let's

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.779 
cart and get transported away so let's
go<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.060> nether<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.330> do<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.960> parts<00:00:25.199> there

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
go to the nether and do the parts there

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.870 
go to the nether and do the parts there
so<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:27.510> already<00:00:27.869> prepared<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.769> trap<00:00:29.250> cast<00:00:29.550> here

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
so I already prepared a trap cast here

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.240 
so I already prepared a trap cast here
your<00:00:30.840> focus<00:00:31.230> would<00:00:31.410> have<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.800> do<00:00:31.920> it<00:00:32.040> for

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
your focus would have to do it for

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.370 
your focus would have to do it for
fishing<00:00:32.550> rods<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.000> survival<00:00:33.510> or<00:00:33.719> find<00:00:34.260> some

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
fishing rods and survival or find some

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.250 
fishing rods and survival or find some
other<00:00:34.530> way<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.739> get<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.130> cast<00:00:35.370> into<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.640> minecart

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
other way to get a cast into a minecart

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.500 
other way to get a cast into a minecart
and<00:00:37.260> over<00:00:37.590> here<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:37.800> got<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.129> portal<00:00:38.520> into<00:00:39.480> the

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
and over here I got the portal into the

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.840 
and over here I got the portal into the
portal<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.020> leading<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.500> railway<00:00:41.010> with<00:00:41.489> powered

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
portal is leading a railway with powered

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.760 
portal is leading a railway with powered
waves<00:00:42.090> one<00:00:42.420> block<00:00:42.690> over<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.230> ground<00:00:43.500> and

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
waves one block over the ground and

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.729 
waves one block over the ground and
behind<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.820> portal<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.239> added<00:00:45.539> lava<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:46.079> encase

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
behind the portal I added lava I encase

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:47.990 
behind the portal I added lava I encase
it<00:00:46.770> in<00:00:46.920> glasses<00:00:47.370> oh<00:00:47.489> it's<00:00:47.610> not<00:00:47.730> flowing

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
it in glasses oh it's not flowing

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.090 
it in glasses oh it's not flowing
everywhere<00:00:48.329> but<00:00:48.780> it's<00:00:49.260> not<00:00:49.469> important<00:00:49.920> it's

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
everywhere but it's not important it's

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.680 
everywhere but it's not important it's
just<00:00:50.160> importance<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.850> serious<00:00:51.149> lava<00:00:51.420> behind

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
just importance of serious lava behind

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.689 
just importance of serious lava behind
the<00:00:51.870> portal<00:00:52.260> because<00:00:52.860> if<00:00:52.980> we<00:00:53.100> now<00:00:53.250> will<00:00:53.489> put

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
the portal because if we now will put

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.630 
the portal because if we now will put
the<00:00:53.850> my<00:00:53.969> gut<00:00:54.149> in<00:00:54.500> it<00:00:55.500> will<00:00:55.770> fly<00:00:56.100> through<00:00:56.129> and

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
the my gut in it will fly through and

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.670 
the my gut in it will fly through and
get<00:00:57.090> into<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.449> lava<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.899> get<00:00:58.140> destroyed<00:00:58.469> and

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
get into the lava and get destroyed and

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.770 
get into the lava and get destroyed and
two<00:00:58.800> guests<00:00:59.010> will<00:00:59.250> get<00:00:59.820> set<00:01:00.030> free<00:01:00.300> in<00:01:00.510> the

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
two guests will get set free in the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.420 
two guests will get set free in the
portal<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.469> let's<00:01:01.710> just<00:01:01.980> do<00:01:02.100> that

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
portal so let's just do that

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.420 
portal so let's just do that
you<00:01:03.329> see<00:01:03.510> suggest<00:01:04.019> got<00:01:04.650> set<00:01:04.830> free<00:01:04.860> in<00:01:05.220> the

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
you see suggest got set free in the

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.250 
you see suggest got set free in the
portal<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:05.850> got<00:01:06.060> teleported<00:01:06.390> now<00:01:06.900> he's<00:01:07.080> gone

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
portal and got teleported now he's gone

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.300 
portal and got teleported now he's gone
let's<00:01:08.250> follow<00:01:08.460> him<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.860> here<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:11.010> can<00:01:11.130> see

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
let's follow him and here you can see

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.280 
let's follow him and here you can see
already<00:01:11.460> he<00:01:12.030> got<00:01:12.210> picked<00:01:12.420> up<00:01:12.570> by<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.780> minecart

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
already he got picked up by the minecart

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.980 
already he got picked up by the minecart
right<00:01:13.439> away<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:14.119> now<00:01:15.119> we<00:01:15.180> could<00:01:15.450> have<00:01:15.810> our

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
right away and now we could have our

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.320 
right away and now we could have our
overworld<00:01:16.500> cast<00:01:16.770> here<00:01:17.040> so<00:01:17.759> if<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.119> work<00:01:18.299> with

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
overworld cast here so if you work with

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.240 
overworld cast here so if you work with
gas<00:01:18.750> there's<00:01:19.200> maybe<00:01:19.409> one<00:01:19.680> more<00:01:19.830> important

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
gas there's maybe one more important

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.200 
gas there's maybe one more important
thing<00:01:20.869> so<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.799> main<00:01:23.100> issue<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.759> working<00:01:24.090> with

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
thing so the main issue of working with

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.969 
thing so the main issue of working with
them<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.960> they<00:01:25.140> take<00:01:25.380> suffocation

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
them is that they take suffocation

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.600 
them is that they take suffocation
damage<00:01:26.100> Rivoli<00:01:26.549> off<00:01:26.700> very<00:01:27.090> often<00:01:27.479> so<00:01:28.610> they

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
damage Rivoli off very often so they

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.310 
damage Rivoli off very often so they
take<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:30.060> application<00:01:30.329> damage<00:01:30.900> from<00:01:31.049> blocks

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
take this application damage from blocks

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.499 
take this application damage from blocks
which<00:01:31.530> are<00:01:31.680> four<00:01:32.009> blocks<00:01:32.250> over<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.640> ground<00:01:33.000> so

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
which are four blocks over the ground so

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.109 
which are four blocks over the ground so
one<00:01:33.960> two<00:01:34.140> three<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.770> then<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.189> got<00:01:35.369> this<00:01:35.549> layer

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
one two three and then I got this layer

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.899 
one two three and then I got this layer
left<00:01:36.360> out<00:01:36.540> for<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:37.680> course<00:01:37.740> we<00:01:38.280> could<00:01:38.460> put<00:01:38.670> less

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
left out for of course we could put less

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.490 
left out for of course we could put less
they<00:01:39.090> wouldn't<00:01:39.479> damage<00:01:39.600> him<00:01:39.900> but<00:01:40.079> if<00:01:40.259> you<00:01:40.380> have

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
they wouldn't damage him but if you have

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.520 
they wouldn't damage him but if you have
solid<00:01:40.650> blocks<00:01:40.979> in<00:01:41.100> this<00:01:41.250> area<00:01:42.049> he<00:01:43.049> might<00:01:43.290> take

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
solid blocks in this area he might take
