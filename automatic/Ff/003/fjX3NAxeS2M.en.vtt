because this phone is a lot about
aesthetics<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:11.070> design<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:12.090> compared

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
aesthetics and the design and compared

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.650 
aesthetics and the design and compared
to<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:13.049> normal<00:00:13.710> galaxy<00:00:14.190> s6<00:00:14.460> this<00:00:14.759> one<00:00:15.000> cost<00:00:15.509> a

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
to the normal galaxy s6 this one cost a

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.779 
to the normal galaxy s6 this one cost a
little<00:00:15.870> bit<00:00:16.020> more<00:00:16.109> for<00:00:16.680> something<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:17.279> make

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
little bit more for something to make

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
and I want to focus on this little edge

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.450 
and I want to focus on this little edge
display<00:00:20.760> here<00:00:21.330> have<00:00:21.600> it<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.779> little<00:00:21.960> bit<00:00:22.170> more

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
display here have it a little bit more

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.439 
display here have it a little bit more
close-up<00:00:23.460> so<00:00:24.150> it<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:25.199> can<00:00:25.680> have<00:00:26.310> a<00:00:26.640> little<00:00:27.300> bit

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
close-up so it you can have a little bit

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.050 
close-up so it you can have a little bit
of<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.750> look<00:00:28.019> at<00:00:28.260> it<00:00:28.470> so<00:00:28.769> how<00:00:29.580> much<00:00:29.730> kind<00:00:30.000> of

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
of a look at it so how much kind of

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.880 
of a look at it so how much kind of
curve<00:00:30.510> does<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.380> have

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
curve does it have

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.940 
curve does it have
well<00:00:32.600> first<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:33.690> can<00:00:33.870> see<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.290> doesn't<00:00:34.680> cover

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
well first you can see it doesn't cover

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.270 
well first you can see it doesn't cover
the<00:00:35.100> full<00:00:35.520> side<00:00:36.590> because<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.770> can<00:00:38.070> have

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
the full side because you can have

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.770 
the full side because you can have
buttons<00:00:38.730> down<00:00:38.910> here<00:00:38.969> volume<00:00:39.390> up<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.719> down

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
buttons down here volume up and down

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.720 
buttons down here volume up and down
keys<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.730> so<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:42.180> same<00:00:42.450> goes<00:00:42.809> with<00:00:43.290> diem<00:00:43.920> with

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
keys and so the same goes with diem with

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.940 
keys and so the same goes with diem with
the<00:00:44.850> other<00:00:45.030> side<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.870> phone<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.590> can<00:00:46.800> see

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
the other side of the phone you can see

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.590 
the other side of the phone you can see
that<00:00:47.160> slight<00:00:47.940> slight<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.930> curve<00:00:50.210> and<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.420> can

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
that slight slight a curve and you can

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.619 
that slight slight a curve and you can
see<00:00:51.840> when<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:53.420> switch<00:00:54.420> pages<00:00:55.020> here<00:00:55.350> let's<00:00:55.680> see

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
premium is because of the edge display

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.219 
premium is because of the edge display
compared<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:52.070> compared<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.250> galaxy

galaxy s6 the normal Edition and I can

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.340 
galaxy s6 the normal Edition and I can
also<00:01:57.869> use<00:01:58.079> them<00:01:58.820> and<00:01:59.820> you<00:02:00.570> know<00:02:00.689> this<00:02:01.200> because

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
also use them and you know this because

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.639 
also use them and you know this because
I<00:02:01.500> have<00:02:01.619> experience<00:02:02.430> with<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:03.530> with<00:02:04.530> the

I have experience with the with the

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.069 
I have experience with the with the
Galaxy<00:02:05.009> Note<00:02:05.219> edge<00:02:05.460> which<00:02:06.450> was<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.719> phone<00:02:07.049> that

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
Galaxy Note edge which was a phone that

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.369 
Galaxy Note edge which was a phone that
had<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.590> full<00:02:07.979> edge<00:02:08.280> on<00:02:08.970> this<00:02:09.209> side<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.750> mean

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
had a full edge on this side I mean

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.890 
had a full edge on this side I mean
there<00:02:10.619> is<00:02:10.760> there<00:02:11.760> is<00:02:11.819> there<00:02:12.330> is<00:02:12.360> there

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
there is there is there is there

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.570 
there is there is there is there
big<00:02:13.140> difference<00:02:13.560> because<00:02:13.890> if<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.159> put<00:02:14.400> these

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
big difference because if you put these

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.600 
big difference because if you put these
two<00:02:14.879> on<00:02:15.120> top<00:02:15.870> of<00:02:15.930> each<00:02:16.140> other<00:02:16.409> you<00:02:16.769> can<00:02:17.580> see

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
two on top of each other you can see

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.789 
two on top of each other you can see
here<00:02:18.000> how<00:02:18.299> the<00:02:19.280> how<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.909> note<00:02:21.900> edge<00:02:22.200> which<00:02:22.650> is

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
here how the how the note edge which is

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:25.490 
here how the how the note edge which is
a<00:02:22.830> full<00:02:23.159> edge<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:24.269> didn't<00:02:24.659> have<00:02:24.870> any<00:02:25.140> space

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
a full edge you didn't have any space

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
film with edge on one side but it's way

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.759 
film with edge on one side but it's way
better<00:02:36.650> how<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.709> Galaxy<00:02:38.489> s6<00:02:38.790> edge<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:40.079> solve

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
better how the Galaxy s6 edge the solve

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.160 
better how the Galaxy s6 edge the solve
that<00:02:40.980> which<00:02:41.909> is<00:02:42.090> a<00:02:42.120> little<00:02:42.659> bit<00:02:42.780> of<00:02:42.900> an<00:02:42.989> edge

that which is a little bit of an edge

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.479 
that which is a little bit of an edge
and<00:02:43.440> still<00:02:44.310> remain<00:02:44.750> having<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.840> buttons<00:02:46.489> the

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
little bit of an edge if it is mostly

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.920 
little bit of an edge if it is mostly
its<00:02:52.530> aesthetics<00:02:53.069> you<00:02:53.430> can't<00:02:53.730> have<00:02:54.000> a<00:02:54.030> separate

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
its aesthetics you can't have a separate

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.860 
its aesthetics you can't have a separate
display<00:02:55.319> as<00:02:55.680> you<00:02:56.129> could<00:02:56.400> have<00:02:56.700> at<00:02:56.970> all<00:02:57.120> Navion

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870

note<00:02:58.500> edge<00:02:58.769> here<00:03:00.349> but<00:03:01.349> yeah<00:03:02.250> it's<00:03:02.849> a<00:03:02.940> quickly<00:03:03.450> a

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
note edge here but yeah it's a quickly a

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.160 
note edge here but yeah it's a quickly a
video<00:03:03.840> checking<00:03:04.709> it<00:03:04.859> out<00:03:05.010> hopefully<00:03:05.909> you<00:03:06.629> did

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
video checking it out hopefully you did

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.619 
video checking it out hopefully you did
enjoy<00:03:07.530> and<00:03:07.739> as<00:03:07.859> you<00:03:08.010> see<00:03:08.250> here<00:03:08.549> on<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:09.480> other

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
enjoy and as you see here on the other

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:12.199 
enjoy and as you see here on the other
side<00:03:10.019> on<00:03:10.859> the<00:03:11.489> end<00:03:11.579> of<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:11.819> edge<00:03:11.879> you<00:03:12.180> don't

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
side on the end of the edge you don't

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.150 
side on the end of the edge you don't
get<00:03:12.569> an<00:03:12.750> edge<00:03:13.609> but<00:03:14.609> then<00:03:14.940> I<00:03:15.650> gotta<00:03:16.650> say<00:03:16.950> it's

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
get an edge but then I gotta say it's

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.800 
get an edge but then I gotta say it's
the<00:03:17.250> most<00:03:17.430> beautiful<00:03:17.700> phone<00:03:18.209> I've<00:03:18.419> ever<00:03:18.569> owned

the most beautiful phone I've ever owned
the<00:03:19.819> galaxy<00:03:20.819> s6<00:03:21.060> edge<00:03:21.359> and<00:03:21.810> I<00:03:22.470> can't<00:03:22.709> wait<00:03:22.889> to

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
the galaxy s6 edge and I can't wait to

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.319 
the galaxy s6 edge and I can't wait to
see<00:03:23.190> what<00:03:23.340> something's<00:03:23.730> going<00:03:23.910> to<00:03:23.970> do<00:03:24.060> later

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
see what something's going to do later

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:25.069 
see what something's going to do later
this<00:03:24.569> year

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
this year

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.960 
this year
releasing<00:03:25.709> probably<00:03:26.099> even<00:03:26.220> more<00:03:26.400> edge<00:03:26.609> phones

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
releasing probably even more edge phones

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.430 
releasing probably even more edge phones
so<00:03:27.870> definite<00:03:28.799> stick<00:03:28.950> you<00:03:29.069> for<00:03:29.250> that<00:03:29.340> and<00:03:29.730> then
