due west from k2 it's really not that
far<00:00:30.420> away<00:00:30.650> so<00:00:31.650> we're<00:00:31.740> just<00:00:31.769> gonna<00:00:31.980> fly<00:00:32.309> there

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
far away so we're just gonna fly there

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.180 
far away so we're just gonna fly there
and<00:00:32.880> right<00:00:33.570> in<00:00:33.780> between<00:00:33.899> those<00:00:34.290> two<00:00:34.530> trees<00:00:34.890> is

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
and right in between those two trees is

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.770 
and right in between those two trees is
where<00:00:35.430> we're<00:00:35.610> gonna<00:00:35.700> be<00:00:35.850> landing<00:00:36.630> and

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
touching down for this achievement we're

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.840 
touching down for this achievement we're
gonna<00:00:40.050> be<00:00:40.260> going<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:40.980> minefield<00:00:41.520> and

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
gonna be going to this minefield and

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.840 
gonna be going to this minefield and
we're<00:00:42.120> at<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.420> hit<00:00:42.719> 10<00:00:43.590> mines<00:00:44.010> consecutively

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
we're at the hit 10 mines consecutively

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.529 
we're at the hit 10 mines consecutively
and<00:00:46.129> for<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.160> little<00:00:47.340> added<00:00:47.640> difficulty<00:00:48.300> we're

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
and for a little added difficulty we're

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.560 
and for a little added difficulty we're
gonna<00:00:48.660> be<00:00:48.750> doing<00:00:48.930> this<00:00:49.020> naked<00:00:49.620> no<00:00:50.219> gear<00:00:50.610> no

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
gonna be doing this naked no gear no

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.959 
gonna be doing this naked no gear no
here<00:00:52.230> at<00:00:52.260> all<00:00:52.469> we're<00:00:52.620> gonna<00:00:52.739> doing<00:00:53.070> this<00:00:53.250> and

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
here at all we're gonna doing this and

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.849 
here at all we're gonna doing this and
we<00:00:54.390> have<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.629> hit<00:00:54.809> 10<00:00:55.260> mines<00:00:56.809> consecutively

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:57.859 
we have to hit 10 mines consecutively

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:00.650 
we have to hit 10 mines consecutively
you<00:00:58.859> can't<00:00:59.100> just<00:00:59.250> jump<00:00:59.309> right<00:00:59.609> in<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.210> find<00:01:00.539> it

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
you can't just jump right in I find it

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.709 
you can't just jump right in I find it
easier<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.500> mount<00:01:02.340> up<00:01:02.640> fly<00:01:03.120> into<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.480> middle

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
easier to mount up fly into the middle

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.429 
easier to mount up fly into the middle
and<00:01:03.930> then<00:01:04.379> go<00:01:04.939> for<00:01:05.939> it

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
and then go for it

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.109 
and then go for it
let's<00:01:07.439> see<00:01:07.619> oh<00:01:07.650> just<00:01:07.950> hit<00:01:08.159> one<00:01:08.340> I'm<00:01:08.880> gonna

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
let's see oh just hit one I'm gonna

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.210 
let's see oh just hit one I'm gonna
blast<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.290> up<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.619> then<00:01:10.710> you're<00:01:10.830> gonna<00:01:10.979> want

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
blast you up and then you're gonna want

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.880 
blast you up and then you're gonna want
to<00:01:11.280> try<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.610> aim<00:01:12.380> yourself<00:01:13.380> towards<00:01:13.710> another

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
to try to aim yourself towards another

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.060 
to try to aim yourself towards another
one<00:01:14.270> it<00:01:15.270> says<00:01:15.540> consecutive<00:01:16.229> hits<00:01:16.470> but<00:01:16.860> there

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
one it says consecutive hits but there

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.480 
one it says consecutive hits but there
is<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.580> little<00:01:17.790> bit<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.119> leeway<00:01:18.409> I<00:01:19.409> will<00:01:19.979> think

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
is a little bit of leeway I will think

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.870 
is a little bit of leeway I will think
of<00:01:20.700> maybe<00:01:21.030> about<00:01:21.420> enough<00:01:21.930> time<00:01:22.200> we<00:01:22.549> get<00:01:23.549> one

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
of maybe about enough time we get one

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.789 
of maybe about enough time we get one
jump<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:26.030> then<00:01:27.030> get<00:01:27.479> blasted<00:01:27.960> up<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.680> know

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
jump in and then get blasted up you know

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.560 
jump in and then get blasted up you know
but<00:01:29.009> if<00:01:29.130> you're<00:01:29.189> taking<00:01:29.549> like<00:01:29.700> 2<00:01:29.939> jumps<00:01:30.420> or

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
but if you're taking like 2 jumps or

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.679 
but if you're taking like 2 jumps or
like<00:01:30.750> 5<00:01:31.560> steps<00:01:32.009> or<00:01:32.430> 3<00:01:32.700> steps<00:01:32.939> it's<00:01:33.360> probably

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
like 5 steps or 3 steps it's probably

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.210 
like 5 steps or 3 steps it's probably
build<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.110> too<00:01:34.229> long<00:01:34.439> but<00:01:34.680> if<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.799> have<00:01:34.979> enough

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
build it too long but if you have enough

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.450 
build it too long but if you have enough
time<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.930> just<00:01:36.930> land<00:01:37.229> jump<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.189> then<00:01:38.280> get

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
time to just land jump and then get

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.660 
time to just land jump and then get
blast<00:01:38.670> up<00:01:38.880> again<00:01:39.150> that's<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.490> think<00:01:41.490> that's

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
blast up again that's I think that's

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.080 
blast up again that's I think that's
good<00:01:41.880> enough

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
good enough

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.450 
good enough
you<00:01:44.049> can<00:01:44.200> see<00:01:44.439> I'm<00:01:44.590> just<00:01:44.619> getting<00:01:44.859> blasted

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
you can see I'm just getting blasted

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.569 
you can see I'm just getting blasted
around<00:01:45.880> all<00:01:46.030> over<00:01:46.060> the<00:01:46.240> place<00:01:47.280> sometimes<00:01:48.280> you

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
around all over the place sometimes you

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:50.730 
around all over the place sometimes you
will<00:01:48.759> get<00:01:48.880> blasted<00:01:49.210> out<00:01:49.630> of<00:01:49.659> the<00:01:50.289> minefield

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
will get blasted out of the minefield

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.730 
will get blasted out of the minefield
you<00:01:50.979> want<00:01:51.219> to<00:01:51.340> go<00:01:51.490> back<00:01:51.670> into<00:01:51.939> it<00:01:52.270> here<00:01:53.259> I<00:01:53.469> get
