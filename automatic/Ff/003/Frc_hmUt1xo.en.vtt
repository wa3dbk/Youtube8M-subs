00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.460
 Photos or other content you can with 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.000
 messenger apps directly and without cost 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.250
 send out 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.440
 that does not just make her so popular 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.330
 Content mostly all contacts will be 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.490
 without encryption to server in 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:20.010
 abroad transmits unchecked by 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:22.470
 privacy guards will be none 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.130
 because I know what they mean 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.960
 to do data 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.060
 I'm suspicious at some point 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.330
 had and actually had 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.330
 No desire 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.010
 That's why the German Post has already 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.870
 because of the secrecy letter legally 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.030
 Obligations are confidential 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.340
 to submit your own messenger app 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.239
 develops the secure instant messenger 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.370
 ledge 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.530
 the special thing about our messenger is 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.969
 just the sims like news videos 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.710
 images completely throughout 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.660
 encrypted and the whole is for 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.699
 users even for free and without any 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.760
 more open it is my first in 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.800
 Road test actually a whole 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.010
 normal app feels like the operation 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.010
 on 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.950
 then i would definitely start 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.880
 continue to use safely 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.130
 media test digital 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.360
 An independent institute has the app 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.090
 on safety and trustworthiness 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.560
 Checked the hackers try the tester 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:40.140
 to decrypt the messages 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:42.150
 but without success she is even tÃ¼v 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.040
 tested and therefore carries the seal of a 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.410
 Trusted app to the functions 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.930
 on request, contents are destroyed, for example 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:54.340
 intimate or sensitive data after one 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.340
 adjustable time automatically 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.490
 self-destruction very cool 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.580
 this is a definitely the argument 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.900
 app to exploit yourself 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.260
 already exploding never find 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.260
 I'm great 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.509
 absolutely super unique is this 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:12.280
 function on request is the text 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.280
 Camera image displayed in the background 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:26.650
 otherwise you do not do that for me 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:28.420
 cool one avoids and messenger apps 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.400
 are quite popular quite right 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.560
 uncomplicated leaf man with friends and 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.450
 Family in contact, however, should 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.700
 while your own data to be sure 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.560
 It combines data protection with the 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.210
 comfort of modern messenger 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.210
 apps and even for free
