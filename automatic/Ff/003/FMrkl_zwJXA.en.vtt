00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.029 
between those things you try to be fast
but<00:02:01.470> also<00:02:02.210> be<00:02:03.210> good<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:04.350> deliver<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:04.860> like<00:02:04.890> a

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
but also be good and deliver it like a

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.719 
but also be good and deliver it like a
serious<00:02:05.929> composition<00:02:06.929> serious<00:02:07.319> performance

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
serious composition serious performance

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.690 
serious composition serious performance
so<00:02:08.840> that's<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:10.019> challenge

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
so that's the challenge

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.960 
so that's the challenge
I<00:02:11.819> think<00:02:12.569> that<00:02:12.840> it's<00:02:13.410> this<00:02:13.620> new<00:02:13.950> season<00:02:14.550> they

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
I think that it's this new season they

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.080 
I think that it's this new season they
breed<00:02:15.270> they<00:02:15.420> bring<00:02:15.690> in<00:02:16.140> other<00:02:16.650> stuff<00:02:17.090> exciting

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
breed they bring in other stuff exciting

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.380 
breed they bring in other stuff exciting
stuff<00:02:18.330> and<00:02:19.069> hopefully<00:02:20.069> the<00:02:20.849> audience<00:02:21.150> are

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
stuff and hopefully the audience are

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.920 
stuff and hopefully the audience are
going<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.690> gonna<00:02:22.470> like<00:02:22.709> it
