00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
pretty fun memories because I actually

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.660 
pretty fun memories because I actually
did<00:00:17.450> enjoy<00:00:17.720> the<00:00:17.869> battlefield<00:00:18.290> 3<00:00:18.470> beta<00:00:18.680> and<00:00:19.580> the

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670 
did enjoy the battlefield 3 beta and the

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.240 
did enjoy the battlefield 3 beta and the
ump45<00:00:20.210> was<00:00:20.660> definitely<00:00:21.200> a<00:00:21.230> powerhouse<00:00:21.890> when

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250 
ump45 was definitely a powerhouse when

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.490 
ump45 was definitely a powerhouse when
when<00:00:22.730> the<00:00:22.820> beta<00:00:23.029> was<00:00:23.270> out<00:00:23.480> but<00:00:24.200> it's<00:00:24.349> gone

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
when the beta was out but it's gone

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.290 
when the beta was out but it's gone
through<00:00:24.680> quite<00:00:24.980> a<00:00:25.099> few<00:00:25.220> changes<00:00:25.849> since<00:00:25.910> then

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
through quite a few changes since then

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.850 
through quite a few changes since then
we'll<00:00:26.480> talk<00:00:26.599> a<00:00:26.660> little<00:00:26.960> bit<00:00:27.140> about<00:00:27.320> that<00:00:27.590> but<00:00:27.829> I

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:27.860 
we'll talk a little bit about that but I

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.830 
we'll talk a little bit about that but I
am<00:00:28.099> playing<00:00:28.400> with<00:00:28.610> a<00:00:28.640> bunch<00:00:29.210> of<00:00:29.480> people<00:00:29.540> you

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
am playing with a bunch of people you

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.019 
am playing with a bunch of people you
may<00:00:29.960> recognize<00:00:30.669> unfortunately<00:00:31.669> we're<00:00:31.880> all

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
may recognize unfortunately we're all

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:33.880 
may recognize unfortunately we're all
scrambled<00:00:32.480> up<00:00:32.630> on<00:00:32.810> different<00:00:33.170> teams<00:00:33.380> were<00:00:33.680> all

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
scrambled up on different teams were all

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.950 
scrambled up on different teams were all
over<00:00:34.280> the<00:00:34.399> place<00:00:34.430> but<00:00:35.329> that<00:00:35.510> actually<00:00:35.660> made

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
over the place but that actually made

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.560 
over the place but that actually made
for<00:00:36.140> a<00:00:36.170> pretty<00:00:36.230> entertaining<00:00:37.010> game<00:00:37.399> a<00:00:37.730> handful

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
for a pretty entertaining game a handful

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:39.939 
for a pretty entertaining game a handful
of<00:00:38.600> them<00:00:38.780> are<00:00:38.930> on<00:00:39.020> the<00:00:39.110> other<00:00:39.230> team<00:00:39.470> a<00:00:39.500> handful

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:39.949 
of them are on the other team a handful

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:41.680 
of them are on the other team a handful
are<00:00:40.070> on<00:00:40.190> my<00:00:40.370> team<00:00:40.430> and<00:00:40.910> it<00:00:41.210> actually<00:00:41.300> becomes

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
are on my team and it actually becomes

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.209 
are on my team and it actually becomes
pretty<00:00:41.960> competitive<00:00:42.559> on<00:00:42.680> the<00:00:42.800> next<00:00:43.070> set<00:00:43.190> of

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
pretty competitive on the next set of

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:45.130 
pretty competitive on the next set of
incomes<00:00:43.699> here<00:00:43.940> so<00:00:44.180> I<00:00:44.210> hopefully<00:00:44.480> do<00:00:44.840> enjoy

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
incomes here so I hopefully do enjoy

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.990 
incomes here so I hopefully do enjoy
that<00:00:45.379> I<00:00:45.649> for<00:00:46.219> some<00:00:46.340> reason<00:00:46.370> I<00:00:46.579> just<00:00:46.609> felt<00:00:46.940> like

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
that I for some reason I just felt like

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.869 
that I for some reason I just felt like
using<00:00:47.239> the<00:00:47.449> ump45<00:00:48.140> though<00:00:48.710> it<00:00:48.859> just<00:00:49.039> I<00:00:49.280> don't

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
using the ump45 though it just I don't

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:50.860 
using the ump45 though it just I don't
know<00:00:50.030> I've<00:00:50.179> been<00:00:50.210> thinking<00:00:50.359> about<00:00:50.660> it<00:00:50.780> lately

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
know I've been thinking about it lately

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.930 
know I've been thinking about it lately
I<00:00:51.079> was<00:00:51.170> like<00:00:51.260> man<00:00:51.469> you<00:00:51.649> know<00:00:51.739> I<00:00:51.769> used<00:00:51.890> to<00:00:52.160> really

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
I was like man you know I used to really

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.779 
I was like man you know I used to really
use<00:00:53.179> the<00:00:53.329> ump45<00:00:53.809> back<00:00:54.589> in<00:00:54.769> the<00:00:54.890> beta<00:00:55.129> days<00:00:55.429> and

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
use the ump45 back in the beta days and

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.279 
use the ump45 back in the beta days and
it's<00:00:55.969> come<00:00:56.059> on<00:00:56.239> through<00:00:56.449> quite<00:00:56.719> a<00:00:56.780> change<00:00:57.109> I

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
it's come on through quite a change I

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:58.959 
it's come on through quite a change I
mean<00:00:57.469> if<00:00:57.559> you<00:00:57.649> remember<00:00:58.039> back<00:00:58.250> when<00:00:58.309> the<00:00:58.730> game

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
mean if you remember back when the game

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.380 
mean if you remember back when the game
was<00:00:59.620> first<00:01:00.620> out<00:01:00.920> they<00:01:01.160> had<00:01:01.339> initially<00:01:02.120> nerfed

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
was first out they had initially nerfed

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.540 
was first out they had initially nerfed
the<00:01:02.539> ump45<00:01:03.109> and<00:01:03.589> it<00:01:03.649> wasn't<00:01:03.949> until<00:01:04.040> that<00:01:04.309> first

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
the ump45 and it wasn't until that first

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.390 
the ump45 and it wasn't until that first
big<00:01:04.970> patch<00:01:05.300> that<00:01:05.600> the<00:01:05.780> ump45<00:01:06.650> actually<00:01:07.220> got<00:01:07.370> a

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
big patch that the ump45 actually got a

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.550 
big patch that the ump45 actually got a
got<00:01:08.000> a<00:01:08.030> substantial<00:01:08.630> buff<00:01:08.840> they<00:01:09.050> took<00:01:09.260> it<00:01:09.409> up

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
got a substantial buff they took it up

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.560 
got a substantial buff they took it up
to<00:01:09.770> a<00:01:09.800> higher<00:01:10.190> damage<00:01:10.520> weapon<00:01:11.090> so<00:01:11.300> that<00:01:11.450> it

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
to a higher damage weapon so that it

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.540 
to a higher damage weapon so that it
does<00:01:11.750> 35<00:01:12.320> damage<00:01:12.740> up<00:01:12.890> close<00:01:13.100> or<00:01:13.280> something

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
does 35 damage up close or something

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.210 
does 35 damage up close or something
like<00:01:13.610> that<00:01:13.670> 34<00:01:14.150> 35<00:01:14.600> they<00:01:15.560> made<00:01:15.740> it<00:01:15.830> so<00:01:15.980> that<00:01:16.010> I

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
like that 34 35 they made it so that I

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.700 
like that 34 35 they made it so that I
had<00:01:16.370> a<00:01:16.400> damage<00:01:17.390> bonus<00:01:17.630> because<00:01:18.200> it<00:01:18.440> does<00:01:18.560> shoot

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
had a damage bonus because it does shoot

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.680 
had a damage bonus because it does shoot
a<00:01:18.830> 45<00:01:19.250> which<00:01:19.520> made<00:01:19.760> more<00:01:19.940> sense<00:01:20.150> that<00:01:20.300> it<00:01:20.510> does

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
a 45 which made more sense that it does

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.630 
a 45 which made more sense that it does
more<00:01:20.900> damage<00:01:20.960> than<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:21.500> other<00:01:21.620> p<00:01:21.860> dw's<00:01:22.370> I<00:01:22.490> mean

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
more damage than the other p dw's I mean

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.100 
more damage than the other p dw's I mean
that<00:01:22.790> that<00:01:23.030> would<00:01:23.180> suck<00:01:23.480> to<00:01:23.510> you<00:01:23.720> hit<00:01:23.870> by<00:01:23.990> one

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
that that would suck to you hit by one

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.930 
that that would suck to you hit by one
of<00:01:24.170> those<00:01:24.260> up<00:01:24.500> close<00:01:24.770> so<00:01:25.310> they<00:01:25.340> buffed<00:01:25.670> it<00:01:25.790> up

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
of those up close so they buffed it up

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.700 
of those up close so they buffed it up
close<00:01:26.180> they<00:01:26.660> made<00:01:26.840> it<00:01:26.930> so<00:01:27.050> that<00:01:27.080> the<00:01:27.230> drop<00:01:27.530> off

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
close they made it so that the drop off

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.620 
close they made it so that the drop off
was<00:01:27.950> super<00:01:28.400> super<00:01:28.580> sharp<00:01:29.000> so<00:01:29.240> like<00:01:29.420> after

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
was super super sharp so like after

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.600 
was super super sharp so like after
eight<00:01:29.930> meters<00:01:30.290> it<00:01:30.470> basically<00:01:30.830> becomes<00:01:31.070> pretty

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
eight meters it basically becomes pretty

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.240 
eight meters it basically becomes pretty
average<00:01:31.940> pretty<00:01:32.750> quickly<00:01:33.050> but<00:01:34.010> that's<00:01:34.160> a

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
average pretty quickly but that's a

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.830 
average pretty quickly but that's a
complete<00:01:34.580> 180<00:01:34.940> from<00:01:35.030> what<00:01:35.180> it<00:01:35.420> used<00:01:35.450> to<00:01:35.690> be<00:01:35.720> I

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
complete 180 from what it used to be I

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.000 
complete 180 from what it used to be I
mean<00:01:35.900> if<00:01:36.110> you<00:01:36.200> remember<00:01:36.470> how<00:01:36.500> you<00:01:36.620> used<00:01:36.680> to<00:01:36.890> be

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010 
mean if you remember how you used to be

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.740 
mean if you remember how you used to be
used<00:01:37.280> to<00:01:37.400> have<00:01:37.520> the<00:01:37.640> same<00:01:37.880> damage<00:01:38.210> model<00:01:38.660> of

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
used to have the same damage model of

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.440 
used to have the same damage model of
like<00:01:38.930> what<00:01:39.200> the<00:01:39.340> pp-2000<00:01:40.340> has<00:01:40.490> now<00:01:40.730> where<00:01:41.330> it

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
like what the pp-2000 has now where it

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.030 
like what the pp-2000 has now where it
held<00:01:41.630> its<00:01:41.750> damage<00:01:42.140> a<00:01:42.230> little<00:01:42.500> bit<00:01:42.590> longer<00:01:42.830> you

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
held its damage a little bit longer you

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.820 
held its damage a little bit longer you
know<00:01:43.070> it<00:01:43.220> was<00:01:43.370> the<00:01:43.520> one<00:01:43.760> PDW<00:01:44.510> that<00:01:45.140> basically

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
know it was the one PDW that basically

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.590 
know it was the one PDW that basically
could<00:01:46.370> could<00:01:46.760> reach<00:01:46.970> out<00:01:47.150> a<00:01:47.210> little<00:01:47.300> bit

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
could could reach out a little bit

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.570 
could could reach out a little bit
further<00:01:47.840> and<00:01:48.350> you<00:01:48.440> know<00:01:48.560> how<00:01:48.710> dices<00:01:49.220> they<00:01:49.400> like

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
further and you know how dices they like

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.580 
further and you know how dices they like
to<00:01:49.730> ruin<00:01:50.060> all<00:01:50.210> my<00:01:50.240> old<00:01:50.540> showdown<00:01:51.020> so<00:01:51.230> I<00:01:51.290> have<00:01:51.440> to

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
to ruin all my old showdown so I have to

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.590 
to ruin all my old showdown so I have to
go<00:01:51.710> back<00:01:51.740> and<00:01:52.130> redo<00:01:52.490> them<00:01:52.700> because<00:01:53.480> they're

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
go back and redo them because they're

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.650 
go back and redo them because they're
constantly<00:01:54.110> constantly<00:01:54.440> making<00:01:54.890> changes<00:01:55.430> and

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:55.660 
constantly constantly making changes and

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.000 
constantly constantly making changes and
they<00:01:56.660> changed<00:01:56.990> it<00:01:57.050> up<00:01:57.200> a<00:01:57.320> little<00:01:57.470> bit<00:01:57.710> and<00:01:57.920> the

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
they changed it up a little bit and the

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.850 
they changed it up a little bit and the
ump45<00:01:58.580> was<00:01:59.180> really<00:01:59.690> heavily<00:01:59.900> used<00:02:00.320> and<00:02:00.710> then

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
ump45 was really heavily used and then

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.160 
ump45 was really heavily used and then
it's<00:02:00.980> been<00:02:01.130> tweaked<00:02:01.400> again<00:02:01.730> since<00:02:02.030> then<00:02:02.270> you

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
it's been tweaked again since then you

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.560 
it's been tweaked again since then you
know<00:02:03.260> it's<00:02:03.470> not<00:02:03.680> as<00:02:03.980> good<00:02:04.310> as<00:02:04.550> it<00:02:04.850> was<00:02:05.330> when<00:02:05.510> it

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
know it's not as good as it was when it

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.420 
know it's not as good as it was when it
was<00:02:05.750> first<00:02:05.990> kind<00:02:06.530> of<00:02:06.620> kind<00:02:06.890> of<00:02:07.010> tweaked<00:02:07.280> a

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
was first kind of kind of tweaked a

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.589 
was first kind of kind of tweaked a
little<00:02:07.460> bit<00:02:07.760> I<00:02:07.790> think<00:02:07.850> when<00:02:08.209> they<00:02:08.330> first

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
little bit I think when they first

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.779 
little bit I think when they first
tweaked<00:02:08.929> it<00:02:09.110> and<00:02:09.259> gave<00:02:09.500> it<00:02:09.530> to<00:02:09.649> 34<00:02:10.160> damage<00:02:10.550> it

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
tweaked it and gave it to 34 damage it

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.910 
tweaked it and gave it to 34 damage it
was<00:02:11.180> basically<00:02:11.599> in<00:02:12.050> its<00:02:12.200> prime<00:02:12.410> I<00:02:12.620> feel<00:02:12.800> like

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
was basically in its prime I feel like

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.949 
was basically in its prime I feel like
that<00:02:13.129> had<00:02:13.370> its<00:02:13.550> sweet<00:02:13.849> spot<00:02:14.150> it<00:02:14.330> was<00:02:14.360> perfect

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
that had its sweet spot it was perfect

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.410 
that had its sweet spot it was perfect
but<00:02:15.890> recently<00:02:16.340> they<00:02:16.550> tweaked<00:02:17.180> it<00:02:17.300> a<00:02:17.390> little

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
but recently they tweaked it a little

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.690 
but recently they tweaked it a little
bit<00:02:17.690> more<00:02:17.900> I<00:02:18.140> looked<00:02:18.500> up<00:02:18.740> and<00:02:19.130> down<00:02:19.310> to<00:02:19.520> try<00:02:19.670> to

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
bit more I looked up and down to try to

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.950 
bit more I looked up and down to try to
figure<00:02:19.910> out<00:02:20.120> which<00:02:20.360> patch<00:02:20.660> that

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
figure out which patch that

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.720 
figure out which patch that
was<00:02:21.110> in<00:02:21.260> which<00:02:21.440> I'm<00:02:21.800> talking<00:02:22.160> about<00:02:22.220> right<00:02:22.490> now

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
was in which I'm talking about right now

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.880 
was in which I'm talking about right now
but<00:02:23.030> I<00:02:23.300> couldn't<00:02:23.930> find<00:02:23.960> it<00:02:24.200> it<00:02:24.320> must<00:02:24.500> have<00:02:24.740> been

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
but I couldn't find it it must have been

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.530 
but I couldn't find it it must have been
in<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.160> aftermath<00:02:25.730> patch<00:02:26.030> is<00:02:26.300> what<00:02:26.450> I'm

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
in the aftermath patch is what I'm

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.540 
in the aftermath patch is what I'm
thinking<00:02:26.930> but<00:02:27.170> I<00:02:27.410> changed<00:02:28.160> it<00:02:28.190> up<00:02:28.310> a<00:02:28.430> little

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
thinking but I changed it up a little

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.760 
thinking but I changed it up a little
bit<00:02:28.730> to<00:02:28.880> make<00:02:29.060> it<00:02:29.120> so<00:02:29.390> that<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:29.590> pp-2000<00:02:30.590> was<00:02:30.740> a

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
bit to make it so that the pp-2000 was a

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.770 
bit to make it so that the pp-2000 was a
little<00:02:31.070> bit<00:02:31.250> a<00:02:31.280> little<00:02:31.730> bit<00:02:31.970> better<00:02:32.270> but<00:02:32.540> I'm

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
little bit a little bit better but I'm

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.300 
little bit a little bit better but I'm
going<00:02:33.020> on<00:02:33.230> quite<00:02:33.500> a<00:02:33.530> good<00:02:33.710> rampage<00:02:34.070> and<00:02:34.190> this

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
going on quite a good rampage and this

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.590 
going on quite a good rampage and this
guy's<00:02:34.460> blocking<00:02:34.940> me<00:02:35.030> he's<00:02:35.180> gonna<00:02:35.270> get<00:02:35.450> me

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
guy's blocking me he's gonna get me

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.380 
guy's blocking me he's gonna get me
killed<00:02:35.930> he<00:02:36.470> got<00:02:36.710> me<00:02:36.860> killed<00:02:37.190> but<00:02:38.150> I'm<00:02:38.240> also

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
killed he got me killed but I'm also

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.140 
killed he got me killed but I'm also
using<00:02:38.570> the<00:02:38.750> m26<00:02:39.260> mass<00:02:39.620> which<00:02:39.980> you<00:02:40.820> know<00:02:40.910> I<00:02:40.970> was

was looking through it I was like man

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.210 
was looking through it I was like man
you<00:02:46.910> know<00:02:47.030> m26<00:02:47.660> mess<00:02:47.990> I'm<00:02:48.440> gonna<00:02:48.650> eventually

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
you know m26 mess I'm gonna eventually

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.220 
you know m26 mess I'm gonna eventually
have<00:02:49.820> to<00:02:49.850> get<00:02:50.120> that<00:02:50.300> even<00:02:50.660> though<00:02:50.750> technically

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
have to get that even though technically

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.350 
have to get that even though technically
my<00:02:51.470> quest<00:02:51.800> is<00:02:51.950> on<00:02:52.100> primaries<00:02:52.730> you<00:02:53.180> know<00:02:53.240> I've

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
my quest is on primaries you know I've

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.480 
my quest is on primaries you know I've
always<00:02:53.480> thought<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:53.870> m26<00:02:54.320> dart<00:02:54.740> named<00:02:54.980> 26

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
always thought the m26 dart named 26

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.670 
always thought the m26 dart named 26
mass<00:02:55.760> are<00:02:56.030> good<00:02:56.270> enough<00:02:56.540> to<00:02:56.810> run<00:02:57.080> as<00:02:57.290> a<00:02:57.320> primary

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
mass are good enough to run as a primary

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.590 
mass are good enough to run as a primary
because<00:02:58.070> I<00:02:58.280> mean<00:02:58.430> essentially<00:02:59.240> what<00:02:59.510> you're

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
because I mean essentially what you're

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.630 
because I mean essentially what you're
getting<00:03:00.020> is<00:03:00.170> a<00:03:00.230> shotgun<00:03:00.890> secondary<00:03:01.400> you<00:03:01.520> know

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
getting is a shotgun secondary you know

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.100 
getting is a shotgun secondary you know
a<00:03:01.670> little<00:03:01.880> pump<00:03:02.150> action<00:03:02.360> shotgun<00:03:02.960> in<00:03:03.080> your

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
a little pump action shotgun in your

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.020 
a little pump action shotgun in your
pocket<00:03:03.590> so<00:03:03.800> I'm<00:03:04.100> actually<00:03:04.310> kind<00:03:04.610> of<00:03:04.640> surprised

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
pocket so I'm actually kind of surprised

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.970 
pocket so I'm actually kind of surprised
and<00:03:05.240> where<00:03:05.360> people<00:03:05.600> don't<00:03:05.750> use<00:03:06.020> the<00:03:06.200> m26<00:03:06.680> dart

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
and where people don't use the m26 dart

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.130 
and where people don't use the m26 dart
in<00:03:07.130> 26<00:03:07.580> mass<00:03:07.760> I<00:03:08.030> like<00:03:08.180> the<00:03:08.330> dart<00:03:08.540> better<00:03:08.900> than

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
in 26 mass I like the dart better than

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.050 
in 26 mass I like the dart better than
the<00:03:09.230> mass<00:03:09.440> just<00:03:10.250> because<00:03:10.490> I<00:03:10.550> feel<00:03:10.700> like<00:03:10.730> I<00:03:10.910> get

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
the mass just because I feel like I get

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.270 
the mass just because I feel like I get
more<00:03:11.240> consistent<00:03:11.930> one<00:03:12.050> shot<00:03:12.350> kills<00:03:12.650> with<00:03:13.010> the

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
more consistent one shot kills with the

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.100 
more consistent one shot kills with the
with<00:03:13.760> the<00:03:13.880> dart<00:03:14.120> just<00:03:14.510> because<00:03:14.750> it<00:03:14.870> seems<00:03:15.020> like

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
with the dart just because it seems like

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.540 
with the dart just because it seems like
and<00:03:15.320> all<00:03:15.500> my<00:03:15.650> engagements<00:03:16.190> people<00:03:16.430> are<00:03:16.520> a

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
and all my engagements people are a

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.390 
and all my engagements people are a
little<00:03:16.640> bit<00:03:16.820> further<00:03:17.000> away<00:03:17.260> you<00:03:18.260> know<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:18.830> the

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
little bit further away you know the the

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.150 
little bit further away you know the the
regular<00:03:19.760> room<00:03:19.880> 26<00:03:20.330> is<00:03:20.480> fine<00:03:20.720> as<00:03:20.930> well<00:03:21.230> but<00:03:21.590> like

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
regular room 26 is fine as well but like

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.040 
regular room 26 is fine as well but like
I<00:03:22.190> said<00:03:22.310> I'm<00:03:22.550> a<00:03:22.580> dark<00:03:22.880> guy<00:03:23.060> you<00:03:23.450> guys<00:03:23.630> notice<00:03:23.960> I

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
I said I'm a dark guy you guys notice I

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.560 
I said I'm a dark guy you guys notice I
used<00:03:24.260> to<00:03:24.320> shout<00:03:24.620> out<00:03:24.740> on<00:03:24.890> my<00:03:25.010> other<00:03:25.300> weapons<00:03:26.300> so

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
used to shout out on my other weapons so

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.210 
used to shout out on my other weapons so
it<00:03:26.780> only<00:03:26.900> makes<00:03:27.020> sense<00:03:27.290> that<00:03:27.500> I<00:03:27.590> used<00:03:27.770> art<00:03:28.040> when

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
it only makes sense that I used art when

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.980 
it only makes sense that I used art when
I'm<00:03:28.310> using<00:03:28.460> the<00:03:28.610> m26<00:03:29.120> but<00:03:29.420> really<00:03:29.780> it<00:03:29.840> doesn't

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:29.990 
I'm using the m26 but really it doesn't

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.690 
I'm using the m26 but really it doesn't
really<00:03:30.170> matter<00:03:30.410> i<00:03:30.560> mean<00:03:30.800> both<00:03:31.310> of<00:03:31.370> them<00:03:31.610> are

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
really matter i mean both of them are

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:32.860 
really matter i mean both of them are
pretty<00:03:31.820> good<00:03:32.060> considering<00:03:32.540> they<00:03:32.720> are

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
pretty good considering they are

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.480 
pretty good considering they are
pump-action<00:03:33.380> so<00:03:33.710> they<00:03:33.830> do<00:03:33.890> get<00:03:34.100> the<00:03:34.250> same

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.490 
pump-action so they do get the same

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.850 
pump-action so they do get the same
damage<00:03:35.390> multipliers<00:03:36.020> as<00:03:36.260> a<00:03:36.290> pump-action

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
damage multipliers as a pump-action

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.700 
damage multipliers as a pump-action
shotgun<00:03:37.430> which<00:03:37.670> is<00:03:37.880> nice<00:03:38.140> but<00:03:39.140> oddly<00:03:39.320> enough

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:39.710 
shotgun which is nice but oddly enough

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.860 
shotgun which is nice but oddly enough
another<00:03:40.040> one<00:03:40.220> of<00:03:40.340> the<00:03:40.520> beta<00:03:41.090> classes<00:03:41.660> I<00:03:41.750> was

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
another one of the beta classes I was

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.140 
another one of the beta classes I was
thinking<00:03:42.170> about<00:03:42.350> was<00:03:42.590> like<00:03:42.770> the<00:03:42.890> m416<00:03:43.580> or<00:03:44.030> the

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
thinking about was like the m416 or the

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.630 
thinking about was like the m416 or the
m16<00:03:44.690> with<00:03:44.720> acog<00:03:45.230> because<00:03:46.130> think<00:03:46.340> about<00:03:46.400> it

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
m16 with acog because think about it

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.280 
m16 with acog because think about it
guys<00:03:46.760> think<00:03:47.090> about<00:03:47.180> how<00:03:47.360> many<00:03:47.540> people<00:03:47.810> use<00:03:48.080> the

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
guys think about how many people use the

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.230 
guys think about how many people use the
ACOG<00:03:48.680> because<00:03:48.920> it<00:03:49.040> was<00:03:49.190> the<00:03:49.400> first<00:03:49.430> optical

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:50.240 
ACOG because it was the first optical

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.090 
ACOG because it was the first optical
attachment<00:03:50.750> you<00:03:50.810> unlocked<00:03:51.170> in<00:03:51.350> the<00:03:51.440> beta<00:03:51.590> so

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
attachment you unlocked in the beta so

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.950 
attachment you unlocked in the beta so
you<00:03:52.190> saw<00:03:52.400> so<00:03:52.760> many<00:03:53.030> different<00:03:53.300> people<00:03:53.540> running

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:53.960 
you saw so many different people running

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.690 
you saw so many different people running
around<00:03:54.020> with<00:03:54.260> the<00:03:54.320> ACOG<00:03:54.680> now<00:03:55.220> you<00:03:55.280> would<00:03:55.580> be

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
around with the ACOG now you would be

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.490 
around with the ACOG now you would be
pretty<00:03:56.030> hard<00:03:56.120> pressed<00:03:56.660> to<00:03:56.780> find<00:03:56.870> someone<00:03:57.440> who

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
pretty hard pressed to find someone who

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.160 
pretty hard pressed to find someone who
actually<00:03:57.650> uses<00:03:58.370> the<00:03:58.580> ACOG<00:03:59.060> on<00:03:59.210> the<00:03:59.300> m16<00:03:59.900> or

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
actually uses the ACOG on the m16 or

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.410 
actually uses the ACOG on the m16 or
even<00:04:00.830> in<00:04:00.950> 416<00:04:01.520> or<00:04:01.640> any<00:04:01.730> of<00:04:01.850> the<00:04:01.940> weapons<00:04:02.270> for

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
even in 416 or any of the weapons for

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:03.850 
even in 416 or any of the weapons for
that<00:04:02.540> matter<00:04:02.750> just<00:04:03.020> because<00:04:03.440> you<00:04:03.590> know<00:04:03.680> the

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
that matter just because you know the

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.950 
that matter just because you know the
it's<00:04:04.070> just<00:04:04.400> not<00:04:04.550> used<00:04:04.940> I<00:04:05.180> mean<00:04:05.330> most<00:04:05.510> people<00:04:05.660> go

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:05.960 
it's just not used I mean most people go

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.360 
it's just not used I mean most people go
with<00:04:06.080> either<00:04:06.200> iron<00:04:06.470> sights<00:04:06.800> are<00:04:06.950> low<00:04:07.160> zoom

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
with either iron sights are low zoom

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.360 
with either iron sights are low zoom
scopes<00:04:07.840> because<00:04:08.840> they<00:04:08.990> know<00:04:09.170> that<00:04:09.200> a<00:04:09.650> cog<00:04:10.250> is

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
scopes because they know that a cog is

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.660 
scopes because they know that a cog is
really<00:04:10.760> not<00:04:11.000> that<00:04:11.240> useful<00:04:11.450> so<00:04:11.960> I<00:04:12.340> expect<00:04:13.340> me<00:04:13.520> to

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
really not that useful so I expect me to

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:14.980 
really not that useful so I expect me to
do<00:04:13.760> a<00:04:13.790> video<00:04:13.970> on<00:04:14.240> that<00:04:14.270> soon<00:04:14.660> I've<00:04:14.840> actually

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:14.990 
do a video on that soon I've actually

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.050 
do a video on that soon I've actually
been<00:04:15.200> thinking<00:04:15.350> about<00:04:15.710> that<00:04:15.920> a<00:04:15.980> lot<00:04:16.220> I've<00:04:16.940> been

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
been thinking about that a lot I've been

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.310 
been thinking about that a lot I've been
thinking<00:04:17.180> about<00:04:17.390> maybe<00:04:17.600> going<00:04:17.720> through<00:04:18.140> some

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
thinking about maybe going through some

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.810 
thinking about maybe going through some
of<00:04:18.440> the<00:04:18.500> old<00:04:18.680> setups<00:04:19.100> that<00:04:19.190> people<00:04:19.549> used<00:04:19.730> to

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
of the old setups that people used to

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.430 
of the old setups that people used to
use<00:04:19.880> that<00:04:20.270> aren't<00:04:20.420> really<00:04:20.690> very<00:04:20.720> heavily<00:04:21.230> used

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
use that aren't really very heavily used

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.980 
use that aren't really very heavily used
at<00:04:21.620> all<00:04:21.770> anymore<00:04:22.010> in<00:04:22.250> battlefield<00:04:22.700> 3<00:04:22.760> I<00:04:23.150> think

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
at all anymore in battlefield 3 I think

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.470 
at all anymore in battlefield 3 I think
I<00:04:24.200> think<00:04:24.500> that<00:04:24.620> kind<00:04:24.770> of<00:04:24.860> beta<00:04:25.130> swag<00:04:25.970> that<00:04:26.330> used

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
I think that kind of beta swag that used

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.050 
I think that kind of beta swag that used
to<00:04:26.630> exist<00:04:26.860> you<00:04:27.860> know<00:04:27.950> it's<00:04:28.130> gotten<00:04:28.400> lost<00:04:28.640> its

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
to exist you know it's gotten lost its

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.460 
to exist you know it's gotten lost its
gotten<00:04:29.330> lost<00:04:29.540> in<00:04:29.720> the<00:04:29.840> memories<00:04:30.200> I<00:04:30.320> mean

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
gotten lost in the memories I mean

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:31.810 
gotten lost in the memories I mean
battlefield<00:04:30.919> 3<00:04:31.160> has<00:04:31.250> been<00:04:31.430> out<00:04:31.610> for<00:04:31.640> almost

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
battlefield 3 has been out for almost

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.839

modern games do not last that long I

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.760 
modern games do not last that long I

00:04:51.579 --> 00:04:51.589 
damage up close it can bail you out of a

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:53.439 
damage up close it can bail you out of a
lot<00:04:51.800> of<00:04:51.860> crappy<00:04:52.339> situations<00:04:52.969> I'm<00:04:53.089> honestly

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:53.449 
lot of crappy situations I'm honestly

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:55.359 
lot of crappy situations I'm honestly
surprised<00:04:53.839> more<00:04:54.080> people<00:04:54.110> don't<00:04:54.379> use<00:04:54.649> it<00:04:54.830> I

00:04:55.359 --> 00:04:55.369 
surprised more people don't use it I

00:04:55.369 --> 00:04:57.189 
surprised more people don't use it I
feel<00:04:56.059> like<00:04:56.149> this<00:04:56.389> is<00:04:56.509> a<00:04:56.539> weapon<00:04:56.990> that<00:04:57.020> you

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 
feel like this is a weapon that you

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:58.989 
feel like this is a weapon that you
you'd<00:04:57.589> think<00:04:57.740> a<00:04:57.889> lot<00:04:58.129> of<00:04:58.159> people<00:04:58.309> would<00:04:58.639> really

00:04:58.989 --> 00:04:58.999 
you'd think a lot of people would really

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:00.639 
you'd think a lot of people would really
kind<00:04:59.209> of<00:04:59.240> gravitate<00:04:59.809> towards<00:05:00.110> especially<00:05:00.559> on

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:00.649 
kind of gravitate towards especially on

00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:02.350 
kind of gravitate towards especially on
some<00:05:00.800> of<00:05:00.889> the<00:05:00.949> close<00:05:01.129> quarters<00:05:01.399> maps<00:05:01.819> but<00:05:02.089> I

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
some of the close quarters maps but I

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.119 
some of the close quarters maps but I
you<00:05:02.689> just<00:05:02.929> don't<00:05:03.050> see<00:05:03.199> it<00:05:03.229> use<00:05:03.589> that<00:05:03.800> much<00:05:04.009> I

00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:04.129 
you just don't see it use that much I

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:05.889 
you just don't see it use that much I
mean<00:05:04.279> 600<00:05:04.759> rounds<00:05:04.849> per<00:05:04.999> minute<00:05:05.240> I<00:05:05.449> guess<00:05:05.659> is

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:05.899 
mean 600 rounds per minute I guess is

00:05:05.899 --> 00:05:07.719 
mean 600 rounds per minute I guess is
really<00:05:06.589> hard<00:05:06.770> to<00:05:06.830> compete<00:05:07.159> but<00:05:07.369> I<00:05:07.429> mean<00:05:07.580> that

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:07.729 
really hard to compete but I mean that

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:09.909 
really hard to compete but I mean that
34<00:05:08.119> damage<00:05:08.569> that<00:05:09.169> time<00:05:09.379> to<00:05:09.529> kill<00:05:09.709> up<00:05:09.889> close

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
34 damage that time to kill up close

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.129 
34 damage that time to kill up close
it's<00:05:10.399> just<00:05:10.659> astronomical<00:05:11.659> especially<00:05:11.839> if

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139 
it's just astronomical especially if

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:14.350 
it's just astronomical especially if
you're<00:05:12.229> getting<00:05:12.349> headshots<00:05:12.679> and<00:05:13.300> you<00:05:14.300> know

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
you're getting headshots and you know

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.939 
you're getting headshots and you know
the<00:05:14.479> funny<00:05:14.659> thing<00:05:14.719> is<00:05:14.899> is<00:05:15.259> I<00:05:15.379> see<00:05:15.589> a<00:05:15.619> lot<00:05:15.889> of

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:15.949 
the funny thing is is I see a lot of

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:18.669 
the funny thing is is I see a lot of
really<00:05:16.459> good<00:05:16.639> players<00:05:16.849> use<00:05:17.479> the<00:05:17.509> ump45<00:05:18.199> like

frag<00:05:57.139> rounds<00:05:57.349> was<00:05:57.589> in<00:05:57.740> like<00:05:57.889> the<00:05:58.009> first<00:05:58.219> week

00:05:58.449 --> 00:05:58.459 
frag rounds was in like the first week

00:05:58.459 --> 00:06:00.969 
frag rounds was in like the first week
of<00:05:58.579> the<00:05:58.639> game<00:05:58.939> and<00:05:59.659> I<00:05:59.899> just<00:06:00.019> really<00:06:00.709> didn't

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:00.979 
of the game and I just really didn't

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:02.259 
of the game and I just really didn't
think<00:06:01.009> much<00:06:01.279> of<00:06:01.339> it<00:06:01.610> I<00:06:01.729> was<00:06:01.849> like<00:06:01.879> man<00:06:02.119> that's

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:02.269 
think much of it I was like man that's

00:06:02.269 --> 00:06:04.269 
think much of it I was like man that's
really<00:06:02.659> kind<00:06:02.869> of<00:06:02.899> a<00:06:03.019> new<00:06:03.199> weapon<00:06:03.619> and<00:06:03.800> then

00:06:04.269 --> 00:06:04.279 
really kind of a new weapon and then

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:06.399 
really kind of a new weapon and then
before<00:06:04.429> you<00:06:04.610> knew<00:06:04.879> it<00:06:04.909> the<00:06:05.300> epidemic<00:06:05.959> hit<00:06:06.139> and

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:06.409 
before you knew it the epidemic hit and

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:08.919 
before you knew it the epidemic hit and
everybody<00:06:07.189> and<00:06:07.459> their<00:06:07.610> mamas<00:06:07.999> were<00:06:08.479> running

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:08.929 
everybody and their mamas were running

00:06:08.929 --> 00:06:11.949 
everybody and their mamas were running
the<00:06:09.079> USS<00:06:09.439> fry<00:06:09.709> ground<00:06:10.009> so<00:06:10.279> it<00:06:10.789> didn't<00:06:11.479> didn't

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:11.959 
the USS fry ground so it didn't didn't

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:13.600 
the USS fry ground so it didn't didn't
take<00:06:12.050> people<00:06:12.409> long<00:06:12.619> to<00:06:12.800> figure<00:06:12.949> out<00:06:13.159> hey<00:06:13.369> this

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
take people long to figure out hey this

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.579 
take people long to figure out hey this
is<00:06:13.729> probably<00:06:13.969> the<00:06:14.149> best<00:06:14.419> best<00:06:15.079> setup<00:06:15.289> in<00:06:15.499> the

00:06:15.579 --> 00:06:15.589 
is probably the best best setup in the

00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:17.259 
is probably the best best setup in the
game<00:06:15.800> because<00:06:16.069> you<00:06:16.159> can<00:06:16.309> stop<00:06:16.579> people<00:06:16.939> from<00:06:17.029> so

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:17.269 
game because you can stop people from so

00:06:17.269 --> 00:06:19.839 
game because you can stop people from so
far<00:06:17.300> away<00:06:17.509> I<00:06:17.929> think<00:06:18.679> it<00:06:18.769> didn't<00:06:18.979> it<00:06:19.189> to<00:06:19.610> like

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:19.849 
far away I think it didn't it to like

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:21.999 
far away I think it didn't it to like
what<00:06:20.209> car<00:06:20.509> can<00:06:20.779> before<00:06:21.229> people<00:06:21.649> actually

00:06:21.999 --> 00:06:22.009 
what car can before people actually

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:24.669 
what car can before people actually
started<00:06:22.399> to<00:06:22.429> to<00:06:23.419> relegate<00:06:23.929> their<00:06:24.199> their
