 hello and welcome on quemener young 

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:11.410
 so today a little video for 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:13.150
 show you the start of the 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.110
 playstation which many wonder 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.039
 if it makes a lot of noise at 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.630
 start or not I will show how 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.000
 for the sake of me just pass his 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.330
 finger on the little tactical button the 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.330
 above 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.260
 here is the village and what is the console at 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.260
 start the deal let's discuss it 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.270
 as could be seen being anyway 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.590
 not too much noise but it is not 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.590
 no longer completely silent 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:07.909
 and when throwing a game so if effect 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:10.270
 we could not do that or not in this 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.270
 zoned 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.310
 I know only part 2 which 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.310
 punishes form 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.670
 this is the coffee noise durand game which 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:51.850
 I still pretty much put the 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.850
 cache of the game if I put you back 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.039
 you can not see the time for 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.039
 that as some would like 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.560
 that's it for the sound in a game you 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.540
 put now by cons when we 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.920
 reads a blu ray the alf a little more than 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.130
 noise since the disc turns almost 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:03:00.310
 permanently his demonstration 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:03:01.600
 immediately affected killzone a movie 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.990
 in blu ray like the strange christmas of 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.990
 sir jack 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.769
 so it smokes 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.500
 I leave you next 5th 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.980
 the coffee sound 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.980
 - karim is launched 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:34.320
 when you hear a little more the disc 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.080
 turns is in a game and in the end a 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.300
 little more disk access than during 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.830
 a disney matane game is that the movie in 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.750
 cash as a strong point for a game 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.910
 video 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.810
 so that's for comparative sound of the 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.180
 playstation 4 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.630
