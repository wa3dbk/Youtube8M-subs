they say all you need

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:17.040 
they say all you need
is<00:02:10.690> our<00:02:10.929> LED<00:02:11.349> light<00:02:11.970> so<00:02:12.970> here<00:02:13.599> it<00:02:13.720> is<00:02:15.870> he<00:02:16.870> looks

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
is our LED light so here it is he looks

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.290 
is our LED light so here it is he looks
