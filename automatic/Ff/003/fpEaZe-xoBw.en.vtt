00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:16.310
 hello you welcome to my dear 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.560
 first raid video I have loot 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:20.180
 made 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.890
 in the first place I should say I do that 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.600
 raiding videos because you guys 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.900
 Of course you have all wanted and me 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.730
 I think I will have fun with it 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.320
 I have my own system of order 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.480
 my head always a bit like that 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.070
 pretends and therefore you deduct 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.230
 Never too complete videos 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.970
 be messed up but that will be 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.680
 probably more short and with me 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.470
 be crisp videos because I never synonymous 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.090
 built a lot at once and liked that 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:47.210
 sorted so a bit too 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.520
 It is almost after the accessories today 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.980
 sorted six line because I'm there three 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.110
 then bought things at once 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.580
 I was in erfurt yesterday in erfurt 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.080
 you can probably go there on a raid 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.980
 admire next week 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:03.230
 only in accordance with my regulatory system yes 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.689
 but today it's worth it 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.820
 three things that are for some 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:10.580
 maybe a little but I think the 90th 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.680
 still video and I would like to 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.619
 you like to show what I expected 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.170
 and I was on the way to 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.359
 New Year's Eve in Cologne and have my love 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.820
 girlfriend beads girl I visited 

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:28.039
 greet you very much and there I was with 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:30.170
 sixx in the street where also the mac 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:31.280
 poster is i can do that for you now 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.710
 not say exactly 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.450
 In any case, I have a hairband there 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.700
 bought and who knows me who knows 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.969
 Grind are super great though 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.770
 sequins are even better and better 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:47.329
 then I discovered something that my heart 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:51.229
 beat very high left a sequin 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:53.450
 Grind hairband for four euro 95's 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.240
 It's a pretty big loop though 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.409
 very fluid so not difficult the 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.319
 They did not even come along with it 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:03.439
 somehow stabilizes you see 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:06.439
 This very mobile and the sparkle totally 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.240
 so it's not a harald everyday 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:13.130
 Especially the loop is very big 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:15.319
 But yes, I just thought he was brilliant 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.030
 for new year he also makes a lot fro 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.489
 or for other festivities the 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.830
 perhaps always so pending evening 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.420
 to go out so that's a whole 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.980
 great hair for 45 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.330
 Only I could not say no 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.290
 I think he was still in there too 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.500
 other colors 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.660
 if you are interested in that then 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.400
 you have to look and write 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.280
 me in the infobox would be great 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:41.000
 happy if you write me if you like the 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.620
 raiding videos then please thanks to the 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.100
 German train I had on mine 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.870
 return two hours on Mondays 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.730
 stay in goding and what do you do 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.459
 if you yourself in the cafÃ© with his 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.709
 laptop and you go to shops there 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:58.010
 Somehow everything is on the station and there 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:00.560
 of course was 16 and they had 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.260
 then so in Cologne had no 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.940
 Cell Fridays Thursdays before New Year's Eve 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.060
 but on Mondays there were suddenly 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:11.060
 sticks myself and I have something for 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.760
 Two euros get me where I myself 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.410
 So, if I had too much inspiration 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.110
 it is already so far but maybe 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.299
 do you have my inspiration of the day 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.819
 video seen that around golden and 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:24.530
 silver nails traded at the same time 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.450
 if I link it to you 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.590
 again in the infobox if you like that 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:32.239
 video is interested and yes I have 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.250
 a few earrings are seen as well 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:39.350
 again very very noticeable those are from 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:41.450
 5 95 reduced to 2 euros and 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.730
 they look like they're hanging out now 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:47.829
 why wait a bit weird 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:50.750
 sometimes or not 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:52.820
 so they look quite sparkling 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.040
 Great and you see it is silver gold 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.420
 and another anthracite and me 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.630
 The really great ones are natural 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:02.750
 Also only for the evening so are too 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.549
 no daytime earrings but i will 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.350
 In any case, then with the golden 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.510
 and silver nails and I wear 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.250
 think that the totally chic determined 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:14.329
 also good for a black outfit or 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:17.269
 to anthracite and for two euros her bling 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:18.109
 bling bling just does not bling 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.000
 pass 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.950
 then I have a few earrings 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.200
 I think that's beautiful but there must be 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:30.830
 I say they were not in sale 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:33.050
 the cost of five euros 95 are in such a way 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.249
 a bronze vintage look I say there 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.859
 always 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:38.029
 and they have a lot of stones here 

00:04:36.859 --> 00:04:40.939
 arranged below 

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:42.529
 and I have to say I have them 

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:44.449
 not bought if the stones all 

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:46.189
 I would mean the same 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:50.749
 not the color but the have 

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:52.459
 all a different optics ba 

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:54.019
 I would find lipsticks now 

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:56.029
 say I do not know how to do that 

00:04:54.019 --> 00:04:57.589
 stones you call that 

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:59.599
 probably not in my camera like that 

00:04:57.589 --> 00:05:01.579
 well I'll take a picture and pack 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:03.949
 you can do that in the infobox friday 

00:05:01.579 --> 00:05:05.749
 you look again what I mean 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:08.929
 because this one is here for example 

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:09.409
 very small whirling particles still with 

00:05:08.929 --> 00:05:12.259
 in it 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:14.089
 the other is milky and normal 

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:15.769
 the pink for example of the very 

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:20.619
 transparent and looks like one 

00:05:15.769 --> 00:05:23.479
 spark glass so very different 

00:05:20.619 --> 00:05:25.969
 textures and that's why I found 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:28.129
 that's great and yes I will 

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:29.839
 stocks no of the next videos 

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:32.709
 if i'm a bit pinka i have to 

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:35.359
 not so much with me today 

00:05:32.709 --> 00:05:37.129
 watermelon colors make-up and there 

00:05:35.359 --> 00:05:38.899
 that did not fit that's why I have 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:46.610
 normal way to those are by the way 

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:48.649
 also from 6 and that was almost the last one 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.799
 Things I expected three things 

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:53.449
 disappear that is something 

00:05:50.799 --> 00:05:55.879
 and I hope that has raid video 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:57.379
 you like it if you liked it 

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:58.969
 then definitely said in the bottom of the 

00:05:57.379 --> 00:06:00.969
 I will definitely fail to comment 

00:05:58.969 --> 00:06:03.559
 make one again 

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:05.089
 We'll see each other again soon 

00:06:03.559 --> 00:06:08.229
 does it well still have a nice day 

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:08.229
 See you 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:19.390
 wobbly was not so good 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:22.030
 if the camera somehow on three 

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:26.220
 things stand and you with each breath 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:26.220
 that could blow away
