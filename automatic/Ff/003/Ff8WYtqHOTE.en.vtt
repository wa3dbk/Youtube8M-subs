00:04:59.189 --> 00:04:59.199 
bucket step back oh I thought that was

right we just need a stop that's it and

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.270 
right we just need a stop that's it and
then<00:05:07.270> if<00:05:07.569> we<00:05:07.750> hit<00:05:07.960> our<00:05:07.990> free<00:05:08.319> throws<00:05:08.650> we're
