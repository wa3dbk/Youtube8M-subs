 Day tal 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:16.420
 male 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.420
 nao 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.619
 me 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.619
 me 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.560
 yeah 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.279
 me 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.279
 me 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:36.540
 Today is a guitar house a little Hiroshima 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:40.230
 We hope to introduce you how to make electric guitar backing this time 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.600
 The court used this time is a measure 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.350
 c 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.910
 d minor seventh e minor 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.240
 f 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.180
 Say the key is c 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.320
 Pure 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:59.420
 It is this rise itself c code 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:03.410
 I don't have 12 cards 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.940
 It is e minor Cebu of three creatures 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.280
 4 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:12.010
 It is a flow of f 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:18.130
 Actually, this one is often used in pops etc 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:21.010
 It is a pattern, but how is an electric guitar with a bag of that kind of chord progression 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:25.050
 Can you express your presence if you 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.050
 Because it is different from the pattern like blue toe 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:34.950
 It's not a good pattern to pull down, but make use of that song 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.429
 However, just taking action 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:43.469
 Well , I can't show my presence 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:47.050
 I think that I wish I can introduce you if the sides referred to as the Viewpoints that we will see a 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:51.420
 Actually I go I try first looks in 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:56.440
 It is d minor from different hardness 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:02:01.140
 It is possible to use this arpeggio pattern 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.140
 I think it is common, but just correct code o 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:16.000
 You can not expect a feeling of song expansion just by following in this way . 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:21.069
 Add the sound of alpha 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:25.290
 At the time of the pattern first to code I think you do this time and want to kinda doing things like that 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:26.740
 From the back of timing the first night of the Plan 1 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.630
 Is 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.720
 Hmm 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.720
 me 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.280
 It so c Dewa 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.670
 hey 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.670
 e re 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.730
 Toilet 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:46.150
 That's this c code's 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.510
 It's a scale, so it looks like 0 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.190
 Do you have 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:54.310
 This melody 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:59.210
 I'm going to put in the actual bar accompaniment Yeah 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:01.990
 Then one-on-two 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.990
 nao 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.040
 It is the first 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.400
 3 strings open 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:13.180
 The first night of the plastic-less 3 recombination 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:17.920
 And 1 fret of 2 strings 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.550
 And 3 fret heart of one string is there a little finger is 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.310
 What 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.150
 Hmm 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.150
 Salt 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:32.470
 Heck 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:38.760
 1 fluoride of reducing the opening of the 1 fret and one string one string 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.760
 This 2 c far 4 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.090
 The 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:47.620
 And this 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:54.150
 Waan tc 4 is 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:58.799
 It is reflected in d minor but in the 7th note of d minor 7th 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:00.080
 To your destination The point is that they sounded at the end of the scene 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.430
 Oh 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.670
 me 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.670
 Tsu the do 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:13.170
 It will be that has led the other d minor by doing this 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:16.100
 N go and I Jaen t in the middle 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.100
 Four 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:25.510
 And here it is 2 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:25.510
 If you go to 3 3 garden 4 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:32.360
 Can this be 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:35.920
 5 frets of 4 strings and 3 strings 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:38.849
 And 2 of 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:42.289
 Said 3 fret me people feed 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:44.510
 This is 34 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:47.720
 Will be 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:50.860
 The last sound is the point here too 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:56.949
 3 gardens 4 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:58.610
 It will be in the d note of the following good minor 7th 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:01.040
 7 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:04.400
 It is the point that it is flowing 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:08.150
 It will be 1 when it flows 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:10.450
 Good Iiii 41 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.450
 Have Tei 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:17.510
 Shit 4 and again this same 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:22.680
 car 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:26.100
 I repeat the sound, but the end is good by doing this 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.580
 I But will f 6 notes go to f 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.580
 Because 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:38.380
 What would it be? F 2 hit f in normal 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:42.150
 You can expect a sense of expanse because it does not hit the 5th 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:43.000
 1 ana to go with the flow 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.780
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.780
 The f 1 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:51.950
 par 4 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.770
 can 4 on me 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.380
 Switch 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:58.980
 Say 4 pieces wow ende 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.790
 I and 1 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.280
 3 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:04.770
 4 pan 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.380
 Known issues 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.849
 Te' said 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.420
 Four 

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:12.660
 It becomes such a pattern 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:16.770
 Well, actually 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:22.590
 I would like to do it while playing the sound of the back behind 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:25.430
 The important thing is to do while feeling the chord progression behind this firmly 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.430
 To go 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.470
 The 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:34.479
 me 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.479
 me 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.650
 1 

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:45.690
 me 

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:45.690
 me 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.009
 me 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.380
 me 

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:54.160
 eme 

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.160
 me 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:02.720
 This last will be the flow of this 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.350
 the same 

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:08.830
 It is a flow 

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.830
 Then 

00:07:09.689 --> 00:07:16.939
 Sounds playing in e minor 

00:07:12.289 --> 00:07:24.249
 Equivalent if you when and from on behalf of the f composition to ring in 

00:07:16.939 --> 00:07:28.670
 Even if the sound is the same, the meaning of the sound will change if the flow of the code's faith changes . 

00:07:24.249 --> 00:07:33.080
 If you repeat the same flow like this 

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:35.740
 You can encounter unintended spread feeling and crab 

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:40.539
 Here is that 

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:45.240
 Nor but Ali way to say theoretically so Toka hit in 9th 

00:07:40.539 --> 00:07:45.240
 Now like a form of it is the shape body 

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:57.860
 It seems like it's an interesting sound by doing in this way 

00:07:53.629 --> 00:08:03.979
 As you can , please try to refer to this side by all means 

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:06.550
 It also has such a pattern to things so please try to take advantage in such as my band 

00:08:03.979 --> 00:08:06.550
 Excuse me
