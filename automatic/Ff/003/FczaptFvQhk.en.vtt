00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.000
— What did you do? Why it's working like that?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.960
— It's Desktop Duplication API.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:30.750
— There's new API in Windows 8, it allows
fast screen grabbing and update detection.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.750
— Some improved alternative to the mirror driver?

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:42.350
— This means we can operate very quickly
without the mirror driver.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.430
— Does it work for any VNC server?

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.330
Or one should support it in software, write some code?

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.000
— Yes, one needs to implement support for it.
(: Implemented in the upcoming TightVNC 2.7! :)

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
— Wow! Runs fast!

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:17.220
— Previously, when connecting from home,
I though it was slow due to the network.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.000
Not true actually. It was slow because of the server.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.120
— Microsoft should have added that API ten years ago.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.120
— Was it slow because of slow screen grabbing?

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.120
— Yep.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.730
— Should not we include the mirror driver in the package
so that it would install together with TightVNC?

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:36.040
— Well, the mirror driver works in Windows 7 and below.
It's not supported in Windows 8.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.940
In Windows 8, we don't need a driver at all.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.820
— Well, I mean that it could be installed
together with TightVNC in Windows 7.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.190
— The driver goes under a different license,
so it's not that simple.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.970
— Then should we write about the mirror driver
in the same place where people download TightVNC.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.930
— Yes, it's there.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.510
Probably it could be made more visible though.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.000
Everything's pretty fast.
