the company to come out with something
amazing<00:00:17.869> and<00:00:17.990> competitive<00:00:18.619> and<00:00:18.770> so<00:00:19.340> this<00:00:19.579> is

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
amazing and competitive and so this is

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.749 
amazing and competitive and so this is
their<00:00:19.880> signature<00:00:20.119> chassis<00:00:20.869> the<00:00:21.349> s10<00:00:22.039> I'm<00:00:22.579> not

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:22.759 
their signature chassis the s10 I'm not

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:24.339 
their signature chassis the s10 I'm not
gonna<00:00:22.880> lie<00:00:22.970> I<00:00:23.150> wasn't<00:00:23.660> expecting<00:00:23.840> something

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:24.349 
gonna lie I wasn't expecting something

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:26.979 
gonna lie I wasn't expecting something
of<00:00:24.619> this<00:00:24.829> caliber<00:00:25.430> as<00:00:25.610> this<00:00:26.029> case<00:00:26.270> is<00:00:26.329> launched

00:00:26.979 --> 00:00:26.989 
of this caliber as this case is launched

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:29.290 
of this caliber as this case is launched
at<00:00:27.110> five<00:00:27.410> hundred<00:00:27.619> dollars<00:00:28.189> instead<00:00:29.029> I<00:00:29.059> was

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
at five hundred dollars instead I was

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.330 
at five hundred dollars instead I was
hoping<00:00:29.540> for<00:00:29.750> something<00:00:29.930> mid-range<00:00:30.559> to<00:00:31.129> blow

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
hoping for something mid-range to blow

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.000 
hoping for something mid-range to blow
us<00:00:31.489> away<00:00:31.640> but<00:00:32.119> the<00:00:32.270> s10<00:00:32.689> no<00:00:32.899> doubt<00:00:33.200> integrates

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
us away but the s10 no doubt integrates

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.160 
us away but the s10 no doubt integrates
some<00:00:34.340> unique<00:00:34.700> features<00:00:34.879> first<00:00:35.780> the<00:00:35.989> build

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
some unique features first the build

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.959 
some unique features first the build
quality<00:00:36.320> I'm<00:00:36.710> loving<00:00:37.070> the<00:00:37.160> materials<00:00:37.670> with

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
quality I'm loving the materials with

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:39.670 
quality I'm loving the materials with
the<00:00:38.090> thick<00:00:38.300> brushed<00:00:38.600> aluminum<00:00:39.050> side<00:00:39.230> panels

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
the thick brushed aluminum side panels

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.220 
the thick brushed aluminum side panels
and<00:00:39.950> I<00:00:40.190> suggested<00:00:40.940> to<00:00:40.970> have<00:00:41.180> them<00:00:41.329> sandblasted

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
and I suggested to have them sandblasted

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.560 
and I suggested to have them sandblasted
as<00:00:42.380> that<00:00:42.860> is<00:00:43.070> the<00:00:43.250> direction<00:00:43.400> we<00:00:43.850> see<00:00:44.060> aluminum

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
as that is the direction we see aluminum

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.140 
as that is the direction we see aluminum
heading<00:00:44.960> within<00:00:45.710> the<00:00:45.800> chassis<00:00:46.280> industry<00:00:46.760> the

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.150 
heading within the chassis industry the

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.880 
heading within the chassis industry the
side<00:00:47.360> panels<00:00:47.720> have<00:00:47.870> magnetic<00:00:48.200> strips<00:00:48.680> that

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
side panels have magnetic strips that

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.280 
side panels have magnetic strips that
hold<00:00:49.430> them<00:00:49.579> to<00:00:49.790> the<00:00:49.910> case<00:00:50.150> which<00:00:50.690> means<00:00:50.960> easy

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
hold them to the case which means easy

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.319 
hold them to the case which means easy
access<00:00:51.890> as<00:00:52.160> the<00:00:52.280> panel's<00:00:52.670> goal<00:00:52.880> was<00:00:53.000> to<00:00:53.149> open

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
access as the panel's goal was to open

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.690 
access as the panel's goal was to open
but<00:00:54.020> not<00:00:54.260> having<00:00:54.530> the<00:00:54.649> panels<00:00:55.070> securely

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:55.700 
but not having the panels securely

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.120 
but not having the panels securely
attached<00:00:56.000> to<00:00:56.180> the<00:00:56.270> frame<00:00:56.540> is<00:00:56.810> a<00:00:57.500> bit<00:00:57.770> worrying

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.130 
attached to the frame is a bit worrying

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.979 
attached to the frame is a bit worrying
one<00:00:58.820> of<00:00:58.910> the<00:00:58.970> most<00:00:59.120> interesting<00:00:59.660> design

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
one of the most interesting design

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.139 
one of the most interesting design
choices<00:01:00.260> are<00:01:00.649> for<00:01:00.800> the<00:01:00.890> frame<00:01:01.220> is<00:01:01.430> this<00:01:01.760> gap

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
choices are for the frame is this gap

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:04.359 
choices are for the frame is this gap
between<00:01:02.750> the<00:01:03.020> main<00:01:03.200> chamber<00:01:03.680> and<00:01:03.829> the<00:01:04.100> hard

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
between the main chamber and the hard

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.429 
between the main chamber and the hard
drive<00:01:04.610> chamber<00:01:04.909> now<00:01:05.509> the<00:01:05.570> concept<00:01:06.020> is<00:01:06.140> great

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
drive chamber now the concept is great

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:08.200 
drive chamber now the concept is great
to<00:01:06.799> actually<00:01:06.950> separate<00:01:07.579> the<00:01:07.640> heat<00:01:07.939> transfer

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
to actually separate the heat transfer

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.660 
to actually separate the heat transfer
