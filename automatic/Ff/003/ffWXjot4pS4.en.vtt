we'll see what happens well it's about
eight<00:01:26.280> minutes<00:01:26.729> after<00:01:26.940> we<00:01:27.300> put<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.599> in<00:01:27.810> and

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
eight minutes after we put it in and

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.589 
eight minutes after we put it in and
it's<00:01:29.310> really<00:01:29.520> smelling<00:01:30.030> good<00:01:30.179> in<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.420> kitchen

00:01:30.589 --> 00:01:30.599 
it's really smelling good in the kitchen

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:33.410 
it's really smelling good in the kitchen
here<00:01:31.140> smells<00:01:31.770> just<00:01:32.009> like<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.250> pizza<00:01:32.819> probably

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
here smells just like a pizza probably

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.290 
here smells just like a pizza probably
that<00:01:33.569> Italian<00:01:33.990> spice<00:01:34.319> is<00:01:34.740> helping<00:01:35.190> out<00:01:35.369> but

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
that Italian spice is helping out but

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.800 
that Italian spice is helping out but
since<00:01:36.990> there's<00:01:37.619> no<00:01:37.950> bread<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:39.030> be<00:01:39.239> cooking<00:01:39.660> in

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
since there's no bread to be cooking in

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.800 
since there's no bread to be cooking in
there<00:01:40.020> it<00:01:40.739> looks<00:01:40.920> like<00:01:41.130> it's<00:01:41.310> actually

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
there it looks like it's actually

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.499 
there it looks like it's actually
cooking<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:43.110> lot<00:01:43.259> faster<00:01:44.149> because<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.270> bread

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
cooking a lot faster because the bread

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.449 
cooking a lot faster because the bread
is<00:01:45.720> there's<00:01:46.110> no<00:01:46.229> bread<00:01:46.500> there<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.920> cool<00:01:47.069> it<00:01:47.280> off

00:01:47.449 --> 00:01:47.459 
is there's no bread there to cool it off

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:49.240 
is there's no bread there to cool it off
or<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.819> prevent<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.209> ingredients<00:01:48.780> from

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
or to prevent the ingredients from

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.339 
or to prevent the ingredients from
cooking<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:51.179> looks<00:01:51.390> like<00:01:51.539> just<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.140> couple

00:01:52.339 --> 00:01:52.349 
cooking so it looks like just a couple

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:54.559 
cooking so it looks like just a couple
more<00:01:52.560> minutes<00:01:52.739> and<00:01:53.009> it'll<00:01:53.280> be<00:01:53.369> done<00:01:53.610> here<00:01:54.000> it

00:01:54.559 --> 00:01:54.569 
more minutes and it'll be done here it

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:55.880 
more minutes and it'll be done here it
looks<00:01:54.750> like<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.989> parchment<00:01:55.470> paper<00:01:55.679> is

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
looks like the parchment paper is

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.529 
looks like the parchment paper is
working<00:01:56.250> really<00:01:56.399> good<00:01:56.520> it's<00:01:56.880> not<00:01:57.030> burning<00:01:57.300> on

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
working really good it's not burning on

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:59.809 
working really good it's not burning on
the<00:01:57.569> edges<00:01:58.080> it's<00:01:58.890> working<00:01:59.250> just<00:01:59.280> like<00:01:59.550> it's

00:01:59.809 --> 00:01:59.819 
the edges it's working just like it's

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:03.910 
the edges it's working just like it's
supposed<00:02:00.179> to

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.740 

well<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:04.950> just<00:02:05.069> took<00:02:05.369> it<00:02:05.520> out<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.849> oven<00:02:06.030> it

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
well I just took it out of the oven it

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.419 
well I just took it out of the oven it
actually<00:02:07.170> ended<00:02:07.410> up<00:02:07.470> staying<00:02:07.739> in<00:02:07.979> there<00:02:08.190> for

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
actually ended up staying in there for

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.270 
actually ended up staying in there for
just<00:02:08.700> over<00:02:08.910> 20<00:02:09.330> minutes<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.929> wanted<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.830> kind<00:02:11.220> of

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
just over 20 minutes I wanted to kind of

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.300 
just over 20 minutes I wanted to kind of
recreate<00:02:11.879> you<00:02:12.120> know<00:02:12.239> all<00:02:12.629> the<00:02:13.310> crispy

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
recreate you know all the crispy

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.580 
recreate you know all the crispy
toppings<00:02:14.819> you<00:02:15.120> know<00:02:15.480> on<00:02:15.629> the<00:02:15.720> cheese<00:02:16.020> and<00:02:16.440> so

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
toppings you know on the cheese and so

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.100 
toppings you know on the cheese and so
forth<00:02:16.950> so<00:02:17.730> that<00:02:17.940> it<00:02:18.030> would<00:02:18.180> look<00:02:18.390> and<00:02:18.600> taste<00:02:18.930> as

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
forth so that it would look and taste as

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.910 
forth so that it would look and taste as
much<00:02:19.320> like<00:02:19.500> a<00:02:19.530> pizza<00:02:19.980> as<00:02:20.100> possible

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
much like a pizza as possible

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.940 
much like a pizza as possible
there's<00:02:22.220> quite<00:02:22.460> a<00:02:22.580> bit<00:02:22.670> of<00:02:23.260> oil<00:02:24.260> I<00:02:24.410> guess<00:02:24.680> on

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
there's quite a bit of oil I guess on

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.550 
there's quite a bit of oil I guess on
the<00:02:25.220> edges<00:02:25.610> because<00:02:26.540> this<00:02:26.720> parchment<00:02:27.080> isn't

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
the edges because this parchment isn't

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.110 
the edges because this parchment isn't
really<00:02:27.740> allowing<00:02:28.010> it<00:02:28.220> to<00:02:28.250> drain<00:02:28.580> away<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:29.060> I

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
really allowing it to drain away and I

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.940 
really allowing it to drain away and I
suppose<00:02:29.480> it<00:02:29.660> would<00:02:29.780> normally<00:02:29.930> soak<00:02:30.440> into<00:02:30.770> the

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
suppose it would normally soak into the

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.180 
suppose it would normally soak into the
pizza<00:02:31.400> dough<00:02:31.720> but<00:02:32.720> maybe<00:02:33.620> when<00:02:33.920> it<00:02:34.040> gets

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
pizza dough but maybe when it gets

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.410 
pizza dough but maybe when it gets
cooler<00:02:35.110> it<00:02:36.110> won't<00:02:36.350> seem<00:02:36.590> so<00:02:36.650> greasy<00:02:37.310> but<00:02:38.120> sure

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
cooler it won't seem so greasy but sure

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.140 
cooler it won't seem so greasy but sure
does<00:02:38.660> smell<00:02:38.810> good<00:02:38.959> right<00:02:39.410> now

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
does smell good right now

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.490 
does smell good right now
well<00:02:41.150> it's<00:02:41.270> been<00:02:41.420> cooling<00:02:41.690> for<00:02:41.840> about<00:02:42.050> ten

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
well it's been cooling for about ten

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.090 
well it's been cooling for about ten
minutes<00:02:42.709> now<00:02:42.950> and<00:02:44.080> it's<00:02:45.080> kind<00:02:45.560> of<00:02:45.620> shrinking

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
minutes now and it's kind of shrinking

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.949 
minutes now and it's kind of shrinking
up<00:02:46.250> a<00:02:46.400> little<00:02:46.580> bit<00:02:46.820> looking<00:02:47.660> a<00:02:47.750> little<00:02:47.810> bit

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
up a little bit looking a little bit

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.640 
up a little bit looking a little bit
more<00:02:48.170> like<00:02:48.320> the<00:02:48.410> regular<00:02:48.739> pizza<00:02:48.950> and<00:02:50.470> you<00:02:51.470> can

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
more like the regular pizza and you can

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.370 
more like the regular pizza and you can
see<00:02:51.890> that<00:02:52.190> it's<00:02:52.910> not<00:02:53.090> stuck<00:02:53.540> to<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:53.810> parchment

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
see that it's not stuck to the parchment

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.260 
see that it's not stuck to the parchment
and<00:02:54.790> it's<00:02:55.790> still<00:02:56.060> a<00:02:56.090> little<00:02:56.209> wet<00:02:58.090> it's<00:02:59.090> not

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
and it's still a little wet it's not

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.540 
and it's still a little wet it's not
really<00:02:59.690> you<00:03:00.380> know<00:03:00.410> eats<00:03:00.830> it<00:03:00.980> without<00:03:01.220> bread

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
really you know eats it without bread

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.180 
really you know eats it without bread
but<00:03:01.970> you<00:03:02.810> know<00:03:02.900> I<00:03:02.930> figure<00:03:03.260> when<00:03:03.410> it<00:03:03.500> cools<00:03:03.739> and

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
but you know I figure when it cools and

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.940 
but you know I figure when it cools and
it'll<00:03:05.030> get<00:03:05.840> a<00:03:05.900> little<00:03:06.019> more<00:03:06.230> solid<00:03:06.530> little

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
it'll get a little more solid little

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.150 
it'll get a little more solid little
more<00:03:07.070> firm<00:03:07.370> be<00:03:08.090> able<00:03:08.239> to<00:03:08.300> hold<00:03:08.480> it<00:03:08.920> it's<00:03:09.920> still

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
more firm be able to hold it it's still

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.540 
more firm be able to hold it it's still
kind<00:03:10.340> of<00:03:10.400> hot<00:03:10.640> but<00:03:11.709> and<00:03:12.709> it<00:03:12.920> really<00:03:13.160> smells

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
kind of hot but and it really smells
