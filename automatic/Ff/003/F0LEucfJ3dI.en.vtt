00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
a nice full pattern on it but that

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.590 
a nice full pattern on it but that
certainly<00:03:13.520> does<00:03:13.910> a<00:03:13.940> colonial<00:03:16.420> trying<00:03:17.420> to<00:03:17.480> get

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
certainly does a colonial trying to get

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.440 
certainly does a colonial trying to get
a<00:03:17.630> good<00:03:17.840> shot<00:03:17.870> of<00:03:18.110> it<00:03:18.350> there<00:03:18.650> you<00:03:18.740> go<00:03:19.330> that's<00:03:20.330> a

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
a good shot of it there you go that's a

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.980 
a good shot of it there you go that's a
really<00:03:20.750> really<00:03:21.290> cool<00:03:21.410> find<00:03:22.480> it's<00:03:23.480> obviously

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:23.990 
really really cool find it's obviously

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:25.570 
really really cool find it's obviously
broken<00:03:24.320> so<00:03:24.620> maybe<00:03:24.890> I'll<00:03:25.040> be<00:03:25.160> able<00:03:25.220> to<00:03:25.340> find<00:03:25.520> the

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
broken so maybe I'll be able to find the

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.560 
broken so maybe I'll be able to find the
other<00:03:25.640> part<00:03:26.000> but<00:03:26.300> that's<00:03:27.170> awesome<00:03:27.620> moon<00:03:28.570> you

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
other part but that's awesome moon you
