color<00:01:38.750> the<00:01:39.020> chrome<00:01:39.290> color<00:01:39.620> actually<00:01:40.070> goes

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
color the chrome color actually goes

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:41.950

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
color on the claws I think that was a

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.980 
color on the claws I think that was a
nice<00:01:45.430> combination<00:01:46.430> of<00:01:47.030> colors<00:01:47.360> to<00:01:47.570> use<00:01:47.600> you

this side I also noticed that in the

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.200 
this side I also noticed that in the
mechanimal<00:01:53.510> series<00:01:53.900> it<00:01:54.490> seems<00:01:55.490> like<00:01:55.610> Bakugan

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210
