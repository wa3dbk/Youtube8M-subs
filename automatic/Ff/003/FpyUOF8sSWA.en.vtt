 to make their little Christmas man we have 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.920
 need the tracing paper tutorial 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.900
 red felt 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.750
 in fact a big one for the nose of 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.000
 white felt for the faces of 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.329
 small mobile eyes of synthetic boer 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.710
 of green ribbon needle field like 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:41.550
 a step once a few and one layer 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.860
 each of the parts of the tutorial is cut 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.100
 then in pieces 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.530
 then 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.530
 on the felt 12 we put his calm 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.380
 where the fixed with the rains sometimes which 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.380
 moves 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.940
 and we cut it 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.880
 we call it stays a second time 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.950
 to do the back 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:14.539
 before you start sewing 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:17.060
 their sales on the top of the triangle 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:19.899
 so as to interest in hanging it 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.899
 then in the fir tree 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.280
 at 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:29.360
 once we've done that we'll start 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:32.030
 to gather the two pieces by sewing 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.280
 so if we already know how to sew have made a 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.990
 right point but if we have small 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.320
 children who start sewing have done 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.320
 at the simplest 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:45.009
 we make a corner goes over a 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.289
 once we have completed the culture of 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:50.140
 triangle we cut the little nose then 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:52.390
 either by yielding ducalcon passed 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.079
 of a dead being by inventing him a is 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.079
 different 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.479
 it sticks well in the middle it is 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.479
 add these two small mobiles 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.770
 we can put a little off this 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.780
 we were such a little funny tool 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.480
 once we are glued to the face of 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.970
 little guy everything is dry everything is 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.080
 to stick well one inserts the purse 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.080
 synthetic inside 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:33.050
 and then close it with a seam 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:36.760
 the empa who gives us a little man 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.760
