00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
prefer it it hits higher so you get

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.949 
prefer it it hits higher so you get
faster<00:02:08.489> kills<00:02:08.700> but<00:02:09.030> then<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.509> take<00:02:09.750> more

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
faster kills but then you take more

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.820 
faster kills but then you take more
damage<00:02:10.140> so

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
damage so

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.470 
damage so
it's<00:02:12.220> just<00:02:12.490> all<00:02:12.610> about<00:02:12.700> personal<00:02:13.060> preference

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
it's just all about personal preference

it's just all about personal preference
really<00:02:13.630> either<00:02:13.960> way<00:02:14.260> works<00:02:14.500> pretty<00:02:14.830> much<00:02:14.920> the

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
really either way works pretty much the

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.760 
really either way works pretty much the
same<00:02:15.810> for<00:02:16.810> those<00:02:16.930> of<00:02:17.110> you<00:02:17.170> who<00:02:17.320> don't<00:02:17.470> quite
