00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
 it was everyone had happened 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.980
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.950
 video recap I think that all the 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.950
 world needs it we've had a lot 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.049
 a lot of info today as you 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.760
 did you know it normally but you're supposed to 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.900
 discover a trailer for Sunday but 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.769
 there is a leak 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.350
 the plot of the trailer of the 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.330
 been advanced to today's blow this 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.060
 morning big surprise I count myself 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.650
 woke up I saw this trailer in which 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.590
 we learn a lot of things already 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.079
 firstly the name it will not be a 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.680
 modern warfare 4 it will not be a black 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.570
 ops 3 it's normal enough slage hammer 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.930
 games that develops this call of duty 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.289
 there it will be a new one a new 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.110
 series let's say who fits in a 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.600
 lineage for me I find it fits 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.500
 a bit of a futuristic side to the black 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.500
 ops 2 and but we feel the paw the dough 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.379
 that jam in quotation marks with d 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.909
 a graphic aspect I find close to 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.909
 that of mona raffard 3 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.760
 in this trailer of the coup we learn the 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.930
 name it would be keyboard ti advance wars 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.050
 warfare the game we will send a future 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.660
 close 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.670
 I think everybody understands where 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.430
 technology military tactics 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.180
 for that 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:30.480
 generates vegetables and wars all 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.450
 just in this trailer we could see 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.580
 kevin spacey who is known for his 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.850
 interpretation in the American series 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.130
 house of cards 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:44.850
 so we do not know exactly where exactly 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.710
 again what will be the role of kevin spacey 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.930
 we will have the opportunity to gather 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.610
 to know a little more soon 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:58.350
 amazon and other sales sites too 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:02.690
 have published the jackets the summer jacket 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.380
 that you are currently seeing on the video 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.790
 personally I really like these 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.149
 jackets tell me what you in 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.860
 think 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.090
 that would be it would not hurt that in 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.550
 this video everyone draws the is his point 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.510
 of view this particular on the trailer on 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.220
 the jackets on on what you think 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.120
 of this new this new series 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.340
 what do you think 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.080
 a futuristic atmosphere that is reminiscent of 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.570
 blackhawks 2 as I say them but when 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.390
 even a small side monoja lighthouse 3 I 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:30.030
 find the release date has been announced 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.100
 November 4, 2014 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:36.670
 good nothing abnormal 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.680
 these currencies for info that ghost tool 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.180
 was released on November 5th you see 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.820
 it's about the same thing 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.230
 it's a town before Christmas a few days 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.120
 after the paris games week 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.520
 paris games week I'm sure they have 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.590
 the opportunity to play it goes without saying I 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.090
 think multiplayer 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.180
 besides the multiplayer because there 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.180
 the trailer we had the opportunity to see 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.980
 on youtube it's only the solo the 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.230
 campaign 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.780
 is what you think it will have 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.159
 multi by then i do not think i think 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.250
 that we must remember that 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:11.650
 the 3 which is the largest living room at 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.390
 video game world that stands in los 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.270
 angeles 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.720
 will be held in a little bit more 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.100
 one month 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.410
 maybe we will have the box 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.950
 the opportunity by donating to learn more 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:27.850
 on on the multiplayer of this new 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:30.550
 call of duty advance bouarfa we will see that 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.790
 in more detail so this video serves as 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.410
 support 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.870
 we need to generate a debate that 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.910
 is confused is to give your opinion on 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.450

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.910

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:49.450
 done on this new call of duty 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.430
 that's all for the video people 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.769
 I hope you enjoy it and that 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.360
 little concept of video debate between 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.489
 quotes will work 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.800
