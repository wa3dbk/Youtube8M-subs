00:00:00.349 --> 00:00:08.750
 The drive of the stamps is a pedal called Matic 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:11.740
 It's a little minor pedal but it's pretty well built 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:15.460
 It is a very interesting pedal 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.940
 I think I want a little to introduce while sound check 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.029
 Ne 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:24.789
 This and the switch off is basically 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:26.890
 In addition to the master's presence and output you can switch to a minute 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.110
 Though I have this mode that 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:34.720
 This mode is a movie 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:39.850
 The condition of the cabinet of the open back is simulated or is this so normal b 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:44.290
 A little more distant is going to be campaigning for a closed bag 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:49.130
 It's a roller girl feeling Shay Amusement 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:56.070
 B Toka you were Ee' Well happy When was I fit the fender care because it Well 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:01:00.329
 The impression is that I tune the sound a little in the reverse combination or 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:06.540
 That basically it sounds good even with this alone, but 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:11.369
 I think it sounds a little bit This midrange when I entered the ensemble 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:14.350
 Its per since has become the impression that lifted To a jerk I think that taste is divided 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:18.509
 I have a little sound check 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.509
 At first this is a clean sound of the amplifier direct 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.950
 Hmm 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.830
 is not it 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.070
 Hmm 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.070
 Yup 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.080
 ni 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.080
 moon 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.729
 The 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.550
 wh 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:55.190
 Boone 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:56.380
 I think it's a distortion that feels more like backing and backing more solo 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:01.870
 so 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:04.600
 This is a bit more drive lean 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:07.600
 car 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.600
 wh 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.920
 ana 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.400
 ana 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:22.980
 Maybe 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:28.410
 Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:31.310
 It is setting the end of this open bag in this state 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.310
 car 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.120
 car 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.540
 The 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:48.290
 ame 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:52.159
 Gara' even though I think a little bit to the attack of character differences come out and 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:54.920
 It's not a card, but this side is a little too well with the amplifier and tuning and 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:59.359
 I think it is a point of commitment in the sense 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:04.560
 So now I've checked with a clean amplifier 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:08.700
 It was a little amply run condition, and this pedal is also interesting 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.900
 With a little crunch in the pedal a little network now Fender amp field since come and think out 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.900
 I would like to 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.709
 Bypass this 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.510
 We are 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.270
 ha 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.410
 I will exchange pedals with this 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.900
 dare 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.290
 par 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.390
 I 'm just doing a little bit 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.350
 yeah 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.350
 car 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.500
 You check the same setting again 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.050
 wh 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.100
 Good good 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.250
 ana 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.250
 yeah yeah 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.980
 Hmm 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.680
 Hey you 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.099
 hey hey 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:07.430
 ee 8 a 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.750
 good b and not rice 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.150
 ha 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.150
 hey yeah 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.650
 yeah yeah 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:33.400
 wh 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:37.440
 car 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.440
 hey yeah 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.150
 wh 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.150
 kee 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.150
 can 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.900
 The 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.800
 yeah yeah 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:08.449
 The point is that the sound gradually thickens as soon as the Ampla Grunchi comes 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:12.009
 I think that ant is clean hmm 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:12.009
 The mid range was lifted a little 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:29.280
 This sounds like a fender tweed amp 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:35.930
 Drive a little drive at drive e 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:35.930
 It feels like it takes a boost from this airspace when you blive 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.090
 tan 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.090
 yeah yeah 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.289
 yeah 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:47.289
 yeah yeah 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:54.409
 ni 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.150
 It is a pedal to say 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:06:01.920
 So there is no master volume 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:05.160
 Vintage type marshall or box ac certy 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:10.590
 Well using deluxe reverb end and use volume 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:15.720
 I think it's a very easy-to-use pedal for everyone , and with a completely clean amp 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:17.169
 One pedal of Chokkurachi as just in front if you do go out to the jazz chorus 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:22.810
 Place it 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:27.039
 The pedals make things and there is this pedal in the form of solo boost 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:32.319
 That sound will be fat soon if I use it 

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:33.230
 I think that the best sound can be obtained for lead tone and blues rock etc. 

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:38.270
 I will 

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:42.520
 This time, it will be very affordable to discover that a little dead stock 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.520
 Please try by all means check and since they are already
