00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:08.130
 The following means is such a mask 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:10.650
 horse mane means pharma group 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.840
 power density shine your hair here 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.840
 keratin collagen and lanolin 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.990
 Now I do not know I have it almost 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.300
 full and also bought in St. Petersburg there in 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.189
 an ordinary supermarket for 300 rubles 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.050
 that could not find myself I had 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.740
 kerastase series on me did not fit with 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.779
 took a 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.420
 I had to wash my hair with something and here I am 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.670
 before finding ben found this one 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.230
 just think sperm drink his voice 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.629
 already dirty though I bought something 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.170
 some kind of planeta organica shampoo 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.329
 I remember nothing especially this mass 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.399
 I'll start after washing my hair 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.739
 all the same more or less were smooth 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.539
 nothing special i haven't yet 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.480
 so used to say how much 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.360
 it really works because i 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.449
 always waiting for another effect than give here 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.789
 This is the mask, so while I have it 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.549
 worth it maybe when I have something there 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.830
 I will end and I will periodically 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.400
 put it maybe it will somehow work 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.610
 different but for now it's worth it 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.950
 whole 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:20.180
 I do not know the following is what I have here 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:25.380
 there is this here 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:28.380
 Iranian brand shampoo with dirt that is 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.600
 this is not the color of the jar this color 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.189
 shampoo that is it really 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.990
 looks like mixed 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:39.979
 clay with mud something like that but 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.979
 the composition of this shampoo 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:47.640
 includes everything that is not included 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.880
 this shampoo that is here a complete set 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.640
 and know another to wash your hair and 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.310
 hair in the bathroom but that's not the way 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.399
 because I eat once and 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:03.560
 he really washes very well 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:07.580
 hair yes he their scrubbing them and 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:10.410
 as if more voluminous and not at the expense of 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.650
 the very concept of hair from the root a due 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.959
 the fact that he is united 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.720
 this is something that feeds on dirt and 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.489
 they become more thickened and then 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.579
 there is if then here and so the volume 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:23.590
 do here now so they are here and are 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:25.870
 pop up because they become 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.879
 more say naughty so 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.849
 tough that is me its effect not 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:34.150
 arrange but how would shampoo for the most part 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:36.030
 the account is not bad if possible for 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.489
 thick hair he will give 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:43.859
 another effect but for now it's worth it and and 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.859
 worth too girlfriend will give 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.680
 the following is by the way des anges 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:52.049
 it costs about 100 hryvnia too 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:58.150
 luxury 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:03:02.019
 mass-market it does not know because I 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.239
 just inherited too 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.700
 good friend means next here 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:10.480
 what is the green pharmacy 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.680
 but with oil rosemary oil for 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.659
 strengthen hair 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.049
 that is, that's how it stayed me I 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:18.609
 always enjoyed the summer too 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.799
 period when nothing comes to me 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:22.989
 they fit joico nothing I could not 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.859
 find I have just freaked out and think 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.010
 damn yes come on 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:29.560
 what the hell is not joking I bought this 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.989
 green pharmacy shampoo and soap to their heads 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.349
 and the usual mask is exactly the same on and no 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:37.810
 does not finish means very well 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:44.769
 washing their hair really they up 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:46.750
 squeaky washed and thats the west such and how 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:49.120
 would clean the scalp after his hair 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.269
 do not get dirty much though it was summer 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:55.359
 yes there is a beach something more sun dust but 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:57.750
 as if not bad, but then I noticed that 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:04:00.519
 he dries his hair very much 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.739
 especially the tips and even the plus here 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:05.310
 from the roots anyway hair dry therefore 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:07.449
 I stopped using it and here it is 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:11.099
 it is written that it is for hair growth 

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:13.959
 Well, I do not know for hair growth, it is unlikely but 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:15.669
 it probably strengthens the roots and exactly if 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.150
 there is a real rosemary 

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:18.699
 butter 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.099
 that it does strengthen it therefore 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:23.950
 by the way and advice if you have any 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:27.700
 pattern you can dig into any shampoo 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:30.580
 rosemary oil and then it will be you 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:33.370
 strengthen hair roots and hair will 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.770
 less drop out here is a nice shampoo 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.180
 Considering the cost is 25 hryvnia 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.880
 I can advise him on principle 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:43.210
 really because compared to 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:49.030
 I would use this better 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:51.160
 whole life but it generally means and so 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:58.180
 sweet threesome finally 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:05:00.210
 what i use now is it like this 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.550
 like this is joy to 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.950
 I'll start with the shabun all but I different 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.620
 as i was told by the hairdresser that you 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.900
 It is necessary to type what is thin hair so as not to 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.430
 to overload a bit different 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.550
 joico body luxury 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:19.780
 This shampoo for volume such a large 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:22.000
 jar folder here is very cool then what 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.740
 a big jar confuses me because 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.460
 I would have you quickly get used to and and 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:29.350
 shampoo will stay okay 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:35.310
 really here i am now soap 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:37.840
 he gives the head volume about 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.930
 hair washed well necessarily 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.730
 after it creak yes that is and what 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.160
 here it is stated it copes plus 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.030
 shampoo this and together with a set I 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.190
 bought 2 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:50.800
 580 grammy that is, the price is acceptable 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:54.910
 air conditioning means air conditioning 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:56.950
 moisturizing but moisturize it up hair 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:59.710
 even let's say it doesn't moisturize but they 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:02.500
 softer after him he is too 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.180
 thin in its texture is also not 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:08.080
 it smells bad but I like it more 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:09.910
 shampoo smells in general i put it 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:13.780
 here somewhere on here this part 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:16.000
 again and combing and combing 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:19.990
 comb did not take what to show bathroom 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.210
 mean and so five minutes in general the fact that 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:25.620
 there I do my washing or brushing my teeth and 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:29.350
 here I go with him then I wash it off 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:34.330
 towel dried hair and beyond 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:36.620
 I put this here means joy to the caps 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.500
 it moisten it for hair need 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.880
 and apply on dried hair 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:43.280
 sure that otherwise it doesn't work i 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.380
 I tried and could not go march 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:46.550
 such is vaunted so expensive 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.800
 by the way 109 tudes 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:51.949
 they they she works for me and 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:55.160
 begged him to buy a saleswoman so here 

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:57.440
 you apply too I comb too on there 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:01.990
 it is all the hair on this part here 

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:05.060
 from the ear and in general 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:08.449
 I walk too five minutes or there may even 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:11.360
 be length not much long because 

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:13.940
 when I made a mask out of it 

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:16.010
 and walked for two hours and went to bed afterwards 

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:18.410
 the wash was absolutely the opposite effect 

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:20.870
 hair was straws it is not necessary 

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:22.760
 overdo the hair as much as he needs 

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:26.199
 take her and in 2 minutes 

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:30.039
 if he is strong and because of the hour is just 

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:32.900
 overdry it so here's such here 

00:07:30.039 --> 00:07:35.510
 my otroet in which I now soap hair 

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:37.639
 and this is now what I'm good for 

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:40.700
 that now it is more clear how 

00:07:37.639 --> 00:07:44.780

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:47.720

 now here so here they are brilliant and in 

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:52.010
 In general, the feeling is very soft and 

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.740
 tips 

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:57.260
 I didn't put any special on now 

00:07:54.740 --> 00:08:00.770
 oil so it was just wine 

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:04.310
