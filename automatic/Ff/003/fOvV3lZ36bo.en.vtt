00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.309
 I can see that different 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.960

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.900
 studying on a fork 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.270
 I have packed a plastic fork and 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.039
 I got the middle teeth off that 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.900
 cut out 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.220
 and then i go alone with the outside too 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.930

 I am going to finish it almost completely and then 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.270
 I turn the camera on again to get it 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.139

 this is for you 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:45.830
 moment to take a break and if you 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.379

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:51.259

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:54.860
 I also made rubber bands 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:58.520
 now I'm going to my last push 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:00.830
 red white blue because the cure is down 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:05.330
 first red again by the orange 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:06.949
 rubber bands and one side of my fork 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:12.710
 you on it 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:15.710
 the other way and then something goes oh no 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:23.529
 so must succeed then the blue goes there 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:23.529
 again blue again off 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:32.569
 keep orange and pieces in the middle 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:35.629
 white goes on the other side and again 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:40.759
 then a red goes off 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:42.909
 red goes off in our last blue and 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:42.909
 on 

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:53.000
 one side on the other side and then 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:56.089
 go twittering and more white and then off 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.930
 my bracelet get you ready to finish it 

00:05:56.089 --> 00:06:01.159
 so I grab these two blue lights and 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.430
 I hold it 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:05.629
 I fold them in half to each other they have 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:09.860
 so towards each other 

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:13.909
 drugs went through it just like that 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:15.110
 it's two blue loops you see that we 

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:16.520
 find through it 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.729
 click on it easier because then I can 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.589
 easier and cut you push through it 

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:26.029
 she got my chicken through my blue 

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:28.069
 rubber bands and then I worry for a moment 

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:29.240
 and good mistake that my bracelet looks good on you 

00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:30.860
 remains 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.839
 and then I go another side that I go with 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.659
 my first red one I started like that 

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:37.789
 weird twisted apple at night I go 

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:40.039
 so grab it now and then I'll go there my 

00:06:37.789 --> 00:06:42.710
 put my finger through because then I can do it 

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:44.330
 clip then you will learn that you are good at that 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:47.300
 bracelet not originally rotated 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:48.349
 that just stands really nicely 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:54.190
 and then I go through my clip 

00:06:48.349 --> 00:06:54.190
 and then my bracelet is ready 

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:59.550
 watch the colors well rotated for a moment 

00:06:57.509 --> 00:07:02.419
 different but red white blue 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.419
