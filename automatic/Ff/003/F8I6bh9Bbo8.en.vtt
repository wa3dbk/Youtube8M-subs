00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.840
 hello co most today becomes one 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.030
 special delivery from I am 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.879
 in the suffering of a that occasionally a 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.470
 can be a little higher and I am here for that 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:16.860
 make my facebook hungry 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.910
 account 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.910
 personally surprise 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.869
 because they have been you get it 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.320
 houses and the other country take a look 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.320
 or they are at home 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.970
 Hi 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.340
 congratulations 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.340
 because you are the 100th liker of 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.570
 but what are we going to do with them differently? 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.750
 today in the with this wednesday 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.640
 the special pineapple trip we go the pineapple 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.530
 namely let it grow again 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.360
 injuries because we need ginger and with the 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.390
 spring onion done what you need for this 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.520
 is tracking and prup 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.430
 and a lot of hope on god this is what we need 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.619
 and what exactly should we do that 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.450
 she me what we are going to do is the following 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.880
 the yellow of the pineapple 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.649
 so this part do not need 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.479
 only the green 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:36.820
 So what we are going to do we cut the part 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:39.460
 the edge and eventually suckle towards it 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.979
 none of this yellow or this brown 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.149
 just about cutting in its entirety 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.130
 off 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:48.330
 The reason why is because of this 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.330
 eventually god can go 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.400
 what ultimately confess is this 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.890
 what we are going to do now is that 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.050
 we pull small leaves off and on 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.700
 it may be a bit with strength and what you 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.370
 is that below 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.140
 come the roots are visible these 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.340
 little brown things 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.590
 that is ultimately the root of the 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.270
 plant and eventually we continue with 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.200
 pull the leaves out until you 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.600
 about to be here 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.280
 and then you may go after a little picking 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.920
 we get this and as you now clear 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.750
 you see the roots and this goes 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.880
 then simply into the ground 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.920
 them we try to do good pineapple minutes 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.920
 in the middle and press it a bit 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.420
 in cases yes, as you can see, even 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.220
 slightly wrong depth of the container 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.080
 how should he put in a little more potting soil 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.030
 so that customers just about the baker 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.800
 grow to two months 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.600
 adjust this sheet and a new one is coming 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.420
 sheet that is over the couch 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.910
 grow until that time you give it a try 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.940
 the three days later and after that the 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.160
 customer slightly less frequent after the need 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.870
 and after 20 months and then this unit comes 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.250
 bundle out 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.050
 we will not waste this of course 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.820
 I'm now just something to enjoy 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.290
 because it grows essentially solves problem 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.300
 not on itself 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.380
 so let's do it together because in the 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.650
 world up 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:11.519
 they don't have room family masters people 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.519
 and still good 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.180
 Middle Ages
