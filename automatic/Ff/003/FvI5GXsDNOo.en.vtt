 Sometimes people ask to have hair 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.050
 bright more now that they approach then 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.989

 bright very very soft and especially the 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.219
 women always ask hey how to 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.989
 have good hair shiny 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.670
 we always recommend this 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.350
 completely natural treatment in the 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.420
 today we are going to talk about a serum 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.399
 of milk protein that helps seal 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.260
 the cuticle and give much more shine to 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.239
 hair when ironing it or the 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.579
 time to dry it is very easy to use 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.050
 before performing either the drying of the 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.969
 ironed and good they will have a lot 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.260
 more shine in your hair this serum will 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.570
 apply 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.049
 under the hand of a professional in the 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.049
 Barber Shop 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:11.250
 it's something very simple obviously is the 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.750
 that I use in the atelier when 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.399
 we are going to apply it on the hair that is 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.200
 like the one the girl has here and there is the 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:17.580
 that the person takes home that is 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.409
 like the one the girl has here that 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.030
 after doing the treatment, what 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.440
 will apply every time you wash your 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.009
 hair when leaving the shower with the 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.080
 wet hair exactly the difference 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.090
 of this with a combing cream is that 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.159
 it is not completely liquid creamy 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.780
 and it is absorbed much faster by the 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.869
 hair, look at the girl and the 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.460
 we apply here a little and we comb 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.140
 untangle easily and touch it 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.880
 it seems that it is not at all heavy and 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.530
 it feels fat and funny that they are 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.140
 important that sometimes these creams for 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.850
 comb or these additional droplets or the 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.649
 silicone soneja with hair a little 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.649
 fatty and that women what 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:58.020
 and you have not suddenly heard that sound 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.119
 when passing the iron with full hair 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.560
 of combing cream that sounds as if 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.600
 we hope by throwing a little egg at a 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.549
 frying pan well that happens also take the 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.080
 hair hair burns and toasts 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.239
 because the combs are based on 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.500
 to oil and these oils when they reach 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.870
 a boiling point that now the 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.550
 plates comes from 450 degrees centigrade 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.230
 degrees fahrenheit because the hair is 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.870
 burn with this makes a movie 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.000
 protective since it contains lipids 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.340
 hydrogenated milk and cut a little 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.650
 Well, that chemical effect that the 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.269
 heat and protects like a movie there the 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.880
 hair check the difference from the 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.290
 hair when you do not have the serum look 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.060
 that you can not even pass your fingers 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.950
 to the difference that we can already 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.900
 unravel it once you apply it and 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.060
 good in this case the girl who already 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.950
 we did previously and she 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.970
 can then now apply it in 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:47.340
 home when it is the one that says that 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.840
 wonderful nutrients so you do not 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.410

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.859
 apply the media to tips 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:33.299
 you immediately have to leave

 You recommend for some wicks that 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:50.609
 I have battered well it depends if they are 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.500
 battered because they split or if 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:53.849
 They are dry when the wicks are 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.750
 very dehydrated you have to 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:56.340

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.780
 Aragon is the part the doctor was 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.209
 doing a treatment with a milk of 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.040
 nutrition for hair gentlemen for 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.540

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.160
 User protein right

 give him firmness to put that hair 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.190
 but beautiful look like she says pastor with 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.630
 a happy face but with a little face 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:37.410
 happy of my models after having 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:39.480
 made the treatment with the public 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.920
 look andré counts beyond the 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.630
 final treatment that the application to 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.460
 things and good look at this girl 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.260
 good and we had made the 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.090
 gloss bath treatment that was 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.040
 as we titled it and look how you 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.930
 we can shape your hair do 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.970
 slight waves in the part of the 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.070
 true bangs to make this look 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.630
 much more elegant after applying 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.880
 the hair treatment looks a lot 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.730
 brighter then that is how it is and in 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.970
 the case of the other girl that I have to 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.810
 appreciate how your hair is dull here 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.130
 and good 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.840
 once we do the treatment 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.730
 Well, we can see how the hair is 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.410
 much more smooth and brighter is 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.090
 recommended for those people who 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.040
 they have made dyes that have been made 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.500
 keratin if you now suffer from a hair 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.870
 very opaque and good because they do not have the 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.270
 ease of being jealous drying is not 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.620
 good for the xii for all types 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.230
 of chains for blond hair 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.669
 excellent because to have the protein of 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.830
 milk is ideal after making a 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:33.840
 doctor with a coloration because it has 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.460
 the chemical process and for the 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.840
 Gentlemen I see that pastor is like that 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.000
 as a pending 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.190
 and I know what I want as a pastor so that 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.930
 take it by the way the other day the 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.610
 another day they said yes pastor and I that 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.990
 I told him that this is part of 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.639
 of the entertainment that we offer to 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.470
