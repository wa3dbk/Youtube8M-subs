00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
address book so here we are in the

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.040 
address book so here we are in the
finder<00:00:42.940> and<00:00:42.970> we<00:00:43.270> can<00:00:43.420> see<00:00:43.600> that<00:00:43.809> we're<00:00:43.960> going

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
finder and we can see that we're going

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.500 
finder and we can see that we're going
to<00:00:44.110> go<00:00:44.230> activate<00:00:44.739> time<00:00:45.040> machine<00:00:45.339> and<00:00:45.519> it<00:00:46.360> will

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
to go activate time machine and it will

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.020 
to go activate time machine and it will
use<00:00:47.470> that<00:00:47.500> Finder<00:00:48.040> window<00:00:48.250> we<00:00:48.370> had<00:00:48.489> open<00:00:48.850> and

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
use that Finder window we had open and

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.090 
use that Finder window we had open and

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
then show us that Finder window back in

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.280 
then show us that Finder window back in
time<00:00:51.309> and<00:00:51.850> we<00:00:51.970> can<00:00:52.089> now<00:00:52.180> go<00:00:52.420> back<00:00:52.629> in<00:00:52.839> time<00:00:53.019> and

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:53.290 
time and we can now go back in time and

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.850 
time and we can now go back in time and

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.160 
knew we had them in the past we can run

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.560 
knew we had them in the past we can run
time<00:01:51.370> machine<00:01:51.610> with<00:01:51.730> iPhoto<00:01:52.030> running<00:01:52.420> and

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
time machine with iPhoto running and

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.780 
time machine with iPhoto running and
there<00:01:53.110> we<00:01:53.200> get<00:01:53.320> the<00:01:53.470> same<00:01:53.650> thing<00:01:53.950> we<00:01:54.580> get

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
there we get the same thing we get

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.690 
there we get the same thing we get
iPhoto<00:01:55.330> going<00:01:55.720> back<00:01:55.930> through<00:01:56.620> time<00:01:56.860> we<00:01:57.430> can<00:01:57.550> go

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
iPhoto going back through time we can go

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.940 
iPhoto going back through time we can go

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049 
address book we can simply get the

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:25.319 
address book we can simply get the
information<00:02:23.530> from<00:02:23.859> there<00:02:24.129> or<00:02:24.340> select<00:02:25.180> them

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:25.329 
information from there or select them

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:25.880 
information from there or select them
and

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
and

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.980 
and
hit<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.310> restore<00:02:26.670> button<00:02:26.700> to<00:02:27.270> add<00:02:27.450> them<00:02:27.720> back

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
hit the restore button to add them back

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.559 
hit the restore button to add them back
to<00:02:28.230> our<00:02:28.260> current<00:02:28.590> address<00:02:29.100> book<00:02:29.330> so<00:02:30.330> this<00:02:30.480> is

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
to our current address book so this is

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.750 
to our current address book so this is
really<00:02:30.810> where<00:02:31.110> time<00:02:31.319> machines<00:02:31.650> itself<00:02:32.130> apart

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
really where time machines itself apart

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.730 
really where time machines itself apart

from any other backup solution
I<00:02:34.770> mean<00:02:35.160> photos<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:35.730> mail<00:02:35.819> are<00:02:36.060> two<00:02:36.270> of<00:02:36.330> the

I mean photos and mail are two of the

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.940 
I mean photos and mail are two of the

most critical things you may have on
your<00:02:37.980> Mac<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:38.370> knowing<00:02:39.000> that<00:02:39.060> your<00:02:39.390> backup

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
solution works specifically with those

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.720 
solution works specifically with those
applications<00:02:42.650> is<00:02:43.650> a<00:02:43.980> great<00:02:44.370> feeling

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
applications is a great feeling

applications is a great feeling
I<00:02:44.850> mean<00:02:45.240> can<00:02:45.600> you<00:02:45.630> imagine<00:02:45.810> trying<00:02:46.110> to<00:02:46.320> recover

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
I mean can you imagine trying to recover

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.390 
I mean can you imagine trying to recover
an<00:02:46.920> old<00:02:47.280> email<00:02:47.880> using<00:02:48.420> a<00:02:48.690> backup<00:02:48.900> solution

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
an old email using a backup solution

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.120 
an old email using a backup solution
that<00:02:50.400> just<00:02:50.670> saves<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.150> entire<00:02:51.270> mailbox<00:02:52.130> we

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
that just saves the entire mailbox we

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.560 
that just saves the entire mailbox we
could<00:02:53.280> hope<00:02:53.400> that<00:02:53.580> in<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.760> future<00:02:53.790> apple<00:02:54.480> also

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
could hope that in the future apple also

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.000 
could hope that in the future apple also
includes<00:02:54.989> other<00:02:55.140> things<00:02:55.410> like<00:02:55.680> perhaps

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
includes other things like perhaps

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.910 
includes other things like perhaps
iTunes<00:02:56.580> and<00:02:56.790> iCal<00:02:57.209> in<00:02:57.450> Time<00:02:58.140> Machine<00:02:58.320> but

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
iTunes and iCal in Time Machine but

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.250 
iTunes and iCal in Time Machine but
until<00:02:59.250> then<00:02:59.640> this<00:03:00.300> is<00:03:00.360> good<00:03:00.660> enough<00:03:00.870> reason<00:03:01.200> to

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
until then this is good enough reason to

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.660 
until then this is good enough reason to
use<00:03:01.380> time<00:03:01.530> machine<00:03:01.620> over<00:03:01.980> any<00:03:02.100> other<00:03:02.220> backup

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
use time machine over any other backup

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.820 
use time machine over any other backup
solution<00:03:03.060> so<00:03:03.870> if<00:03:04.170> you're<00:03:04.440> not<00:03:04.530> using<00:03:04.680> time
