 due attention is paid to the quality of the skin 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.769
 how hardware cosmetology copes 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:13.259
 with this task will tell our color i would 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.960
 recommended co2 fractional procedure 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.820
 laser resurfacing those patients who 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.400
 quite late decided to start 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.680
 take care of yourself that is it in 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.090
 about 45 years old then there are those who 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.539
 not used before 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.990
 annual fractals and peels which 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.489
 are aging prevention and 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.520
 accumulated a large enough amount 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.530
 pathological skin changes 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.809
 the procedure is the base of it we 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.940
 We begin that is, it allows you to immediately 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.050
 get a good enough result 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.090
 skin rejuvenation improving tone 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.680
 wrinkle alignment pore constriction already 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.940
 after it we can use 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.699
 traditional methods such as botox 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.320
 hyaluronic acid filling 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:00.780
 biorevitalization plazmolifting and others 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.850
 methods that are so popular on 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.920
 today for young patients 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.630
 this procedure may also be relevant 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.180
 if required 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.280
 polishing scars after acne 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.119
 it should be noted that this procedure is not 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.700
 coursework 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.189
 enough to do one session in order 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.790
 to get pronounced long-term 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.189
 result 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.689
 repeat this procedure 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:23.820
 maybe no earlier than a year 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:28.130
 since the result is even from one 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.130
 the session increases for half a year 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.820
 unlike other co2 laser 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.950
 devices that worked only on 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.160
 surfaces and acted more like 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.530
 peeling that's how in this case on our 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:52.110
 parati can use super mode and 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.650
 impulses that penetrate deep into 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.120
 derma 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.700
 thereby stimulating the production 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.740
 collagen fibers and skin contraction 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.660
 the procedure is carried out under local 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.920
 anesthesia is absolutely 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.920
 comfortable for the patient 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.980
 rehabilitation period after this 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:42.010
 the procedure takes about a week 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.170
 because the person does not look perfect can 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.730
 be redness and peeling like 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.280
 brown crust 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.069
 in a week you will see a new one 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.390
 young skin on your face and you will understand 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:56.620
 that the result of it was worth 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.750
 I hope this information will be useful to you 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.819
