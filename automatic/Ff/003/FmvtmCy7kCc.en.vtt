are awful horrendous effects of this but
I<00:02:23.400> think<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:23.910> fact<00:02:24.150> that<00:02:24.269> this<00:02:24.569> even<00:02:24.930> happened

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
I think the fact that this even happened

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.430 
I think the fact that this even happened
in<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.590> first<00:02:25.860> place<00:02:26.129> is<00:02:26.370> so<00:02:27.239> revolting<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:28.290> me

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
in the first place is so revolting to me

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.089 
in the first place is so revolting to me
hmm

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
hmm

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.370 
hmm
that's<00:02:29.700> interesting<00:02:30.269> look<00:02:30.660> I<00:02:30.810> think<00:02:30.870> I

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
that's interesting look I think I

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.440 
that's interesting look I think I
consider<00:02:32.099> myself<00:02:32.280> a<00:02:32.550> liberal<00:02:32.819> I<00:02:33.000> consider

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
consider myself a liberal I consider

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.850 
consider myself a liberal I consider
myself<00:02:33.630> an<00:02:33.840> animal<00:02:34.170> lover<00:02:34.290> but<00:02:34.530> I<00:02:34.590> think<00:02:34.769> I

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
myself an animal lover but I think I

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:35.930 
myself an animal lover but I think I
have<00:02:34.980> a<00:02:35.010> slightly<00:02:35.280> different<00:02:35.430> position<00:02:35.640> I

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
have a slightly different position I

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.210 
have a slightly different position I
think<00:02:36.420> it<00:02:36.510> does<00:02:36.690> matter<00:02:37.050> that<00:02:37.200> he<00:02:37.560> was<00:02:37.769> a<00:02:37.800> big

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
think it does matter that he was a big

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.160 
think it does matter that he was a big
revenue<00:02:38.849> generator<00:02:39.390> for<00:02:39.630> this<00:02:39.750> area<00:02:40.019> I'm<00:02:40.080> not

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
revenue generator for this area I'm not

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.570 
revenue generator for this area I'm not
saying<00:02:40.440> it<00:02:40.500> doesn't<00:02:40.650> matter<00:02:40.950> I'm<00:02:41.190> just<00:02:41.400> saying

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
saying it doesn't matter I'm just saying

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.369 
saying it doesn't matter I'm just saying
that's<00:02:41.700> not<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.090> primary<00:02:42.510> point<00:02:42.780> of<00:02:42.959> this<00:02:43.140> I

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
that's not the primary point of this I

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.170 
that's not the primary point of this I
think<00:02:43.440> it's<00:02:43.799> awful<00:02:44.220> that<00:02:44.310> people<00:02:44.610> are<00:02:44.819> still

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
think it's awful that people are still

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.720 
think it's awful that people are still
allowed<00:02:45.360> to<00:02:45.560> kill<00:02:46.560> beautiful<00:02:47.160> creatures<00:02:47.549> like

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
allowed to kill beautiful creatures like

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.080 
allowed to kill beautiful creatures like
this<00:02:47.910> yeah<00:02:48.810> I<00:02:49.110> mean<00:02:49.290> look<00:02:49.769> I<00:02:49.950> I<00:02:50.340> think<00:02:50.910> that<00:02:51.060> I

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
this yeah I mean look I I think that I

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.729 
this yeah I mean look I I think that I
if<00:02:51.420> we<00:02:51.450> wanted<00:02:51.930> to<00:02:51.989> we<00:02:52.110> could<00:02:52.319> break<00:02:52.500> down<00:02:52.709> a

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
if we wanted to we could break down a

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.020 
if we wanted to we could break down a
lot<00:02:52.980> of<00:02:53.099> different<00:02:53.370> ways<00:02:53.489> there<00:02:53.760> are<00:02:53.819> a<00:02:53.849> lot<00:02:53.970> of

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
lot of different ways there are a lot of

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.339 
lot of different ways there are a lot of
different<00:02:54.269> times<00:02:54.420> in<00:02:54.690> which<00:02:54.780> I<00:02:54.959> think<00:02:55.200> that

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
different times in which I think that

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.740 
different times in which I think that
hunting<00:02:55.709> is<00:02:56.010> wrong<00:02:56.340> to<00:02:56.579> do<00:02:56.700> or<00:02:57.000> is<00:02:57.209> right<00:02:57.420> to<00:02:57.630> do

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
hunting is wrong to do or is right to do

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.930 
hunting is wrong to do or is right to do
I<00:02:58.079> think<00:02:58.530> that<00:02:58.680> in<00:02:58.769> general<00:02:58.980> if<00:02:59.280> you<00:02:59.430> are<00:02:59.579> still

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
I think that in general if you are still

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.180 
I think that in general if you are still
doing<00:03:00.120> it<00:03:00.390> as<00:03:00.540> much<00:03:00.989> many<00:03:01.290> fewer<00:03:01.620> need<00:03:01.920> to<00:03:02.069> do

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
doing it as much many fewer need to do

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.630 
doing it as much many fewer need to do
now<00:03:02.340> than<00:03:02.579> used<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:02.880> you're<00:03:03.569> hunting<00:03:03.810> for<00:03:03.989> food

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
now than used to you're hunting for food

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.460 
now than used to you're hunting for food
participating<00:03:05.640> in<00:03:05.730> a<00:03:05.790> khole<00:03:06.090> in<00:03:06.569> Africa<00:03:07.260> and

he was in a tent and he was starving and

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.410

the picture over it's just so yeah yeah

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.580 
the picture over it's just so yeah yeah
and<00:03:59.160> again<00:03:59.579> I<00:03:59.819> don't<00:04:00.450> think<00:04:00.660> I<00:04:00.959> I<00:04:01.049> think<00:04:01.260> that

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
and again I don't think I I think that

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.319 
and again I don't think I I think that
there<00:04:01.739> are<00:04:01.829> cases<00:04:02.010> in<00:04:02.400> which<00:04:02.430> hunting<00:04:03.060> makes

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
there are cases in which hunting makes

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.240 
there are cases in which hunting makes
sense<00:04:03.630> I'm<00:04:03.870> not<00:04:04.049> against<00:04:04.590> hunting

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
sense I'm not against hunting

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.400 
sense I'm not against hunting
necessarily<00:04:05.970> in<00:04:06.060> all<00:04:06.150> cases<00:04:06.359> but<00:04:06.750> in<00:04:06.989> this

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
necessarily in all cases but in this

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.379 
necessarily in all cases but in this
particular<00:04:07.620> case<00:04:08.099> where<00:04:08.400> they<00:04:08.849> are<00:04:09.000> clearly

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389 
particular case where they are clearly

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:11.360 
particular case where they are clearly
trying<00:04:09.840> to<00:04:10.019> evade<00:04:10.349> the<00:04:10.500> law<00:04:10.530> the<00:04:10.889> law<00:04:11.010> saying

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
trying to evade the law the law saying

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:12.589 
trying to evade the law the law saying
that<00:04:11.519> while<00:04:11.700> they're<00:04:11.880> in<00:04:12.030> that<00:04:12.209> area<00:04:12.569> you

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
that while they're in that area you

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.479 
that while they're in that area you
can't<00:04:13.019> shoot<00:04:13.230> them<00:04:13.440> and<00:04:13.590> so<00:04:13.799> they<00:04:14.069> lure<00:04:14.280> them

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
can't shoot them and so they lure them

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.339 
can't shoot them and so they lure them
out<00:04:14.639> and<00:04:14.819> this<00:04:15.269> is<00:04:15.450> not<00:04:15.599> an<00:04:15.750> isolated<00:04:15.900> incident

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.710 
day if like if you went wild boar
hunting<00:04:44.680> with<00:04:44.889> a<00:04:44.919> spear<00:04:45.520> people<00:04:45.970> died<00:04:46.210> doing

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
hunting with a spear people died doing

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.629 
hunting with a spear people died doing
that<00:04:46.870> okay<00:04:47.139> fine<00:04:47.379> you<00:04:47.560> can<00:04:47.590> say<00:04:47.949> that<00:04:48.220> you

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 
that okay fine you can say that you

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:50.249 
that okay fine you can say that you
killed<00:04:49.030> this<00:04:49.240> thing<00:04:49.539> that<00:04:49.720> could<00:04:49.900> have<00:04:50.020> killed

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:50.259 
killed this thing that could have killed

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:52.290 
killed this thing that could have killed
you<00:04:50.530> back<00:04:50.740> maybe<00:04:51.370> that<00:04:51.490> makes<00:04:51.789> you<00:04:52.000> a<00:04:52.060> badass

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
you back maybe that makes you a badass

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.689 
you back maybe that makes you a badass
or<00:04:52.659> whatever<00:04:52.960> but<00:04:53.590> I<00:04:53.620> know<00:04:53.770> I<00:04:53.889> don't<00:04:54.039> get<00:04:54.430> just

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:54.699 
or whatever but I know I don't get just

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:56.999 
or whatever but I know I don't get just
having<00:04:55.090> the<00:04:55.240> lion<00:04:55.509> head<00:04:55.990> I<00:04:56.289> would<00:04:56.590> if<00:04:56.740> I<00:04:56.830> walk

00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:57.009 
having the lion head I would if I walk

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:58.559 
having the lion head I would if I walk
in<00:04:57.159> a<00:04:57.220> room<00:04:57.400> there<00:04:57.580> was<00:04:57.669> a<00:04:57.729> line<00:04:57.909> that<00:04:58.120> food<00:04:58.419> is

00:04:58.559 --> 00:04:58.569 
in a room there was a line that food is

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:01.350 
in a room there was a line that food is
the<00:04:58.720> only<00:04:58.930> times<00:04:59.169> that<00:04:59.289> killing<00:05:00.159> is<00:05:00.490> okay

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
the only times that killing is okay

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.360 
the only times that killing is okay
mm-hmm<00:05:02.080> those<00:05:02.259> that's<00:05:02.530> my<00:05:02.680> that's<00:05:02.860> my<00:05:02.979> opinion

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
mm-hmm those that's my that's my opinion

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.950 
mm-hmm those that's my that's my opinion
and<00:05:03.580> maybe<00:05:03.970> if<00:05:04.060> you'll<00:05:04.180> disagree<00:05:04.449> with<00:05:04.690> me<00:05:04.810> but

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
and maybe if you'll disagree with me but

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.279 
and maybe if you'll disagree with me but
I<00:05:05.020> this<00:05:05.860> yeah<00:05:06.130> there's<00:05:06.340> some<00:05:06.490> cases<00:05:06.880> in<00:05:06.970> which

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:07.289 
I this yeah there's some cases in which

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:10.140 
I this yeah there's some cases in which
for<00:05:08.289> the<00:05:08.500> ecology<00:05:09.009> of<00:05:09.069> an<00:05:09.159> area<00:05:09.490> you<00:05:09.699> do<00:05:09.909> have

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
for the ecology of an area you do have

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.089 
for the ecology of an area you do have
to<00:05:10.330> say<00:05:10.509> like<00:05:10.720> wipe<00:05:10.990> out<00:05:11.229> a<00:05:11.259> number<00:05:11.530> of<00:05:11.710> deer<00:05:11.919> or

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:12.099 
to say like wipe out a number of deer or

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:13.260 
to say like wipe out a number of deer or
something<00:05:12.370> like<00:05:12.460> that<00:05:12.639> because<00:05:12.940> if<00:05:13.030> you<00:05:13.060> don't

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
something like that because if you don't

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.850 
something like that because if you don't
then<00:05:13.539> they'll<00:05:13.659> strip<00:05:13.900> the<00:05:14.080> area<00:05:14.560> of<00:05:14.620> all<00:05:14.740> the

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
then they'll strip the area of all the

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.589 
then they'll strip the area of all the
food<00:05:15.039> and<00:05:15.219> then<00:05:15.340> all<00:05:15.699> the<00:05:15.940> deer<00:05:16.120> will<00:05:16.300> die<00:05:16.449> out

00:05:16.589 --> 00:05:16.599 
food and then all the deer will die out

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:17.670 
food and then all the deer will die out
and<00:05:16.750> so<00:05:16.870> there<00:05:16.990> are<00:05:17.080> some<00:05:17.199> reasons<00:05:17.620> why

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
and so there are some reasons why

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.070 
and so there are some reasons why
sometimes<00:05:18.460> something<00:05:18.969> needs<00:05:19.150> to<00:05:19.210> happen<00:05:19.270> even

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
sometimes something needs to happen even

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.420 
sometimes something needs to happen even
if<00:05:20.169> you<00:05:20.259> don't<00:05:20.440> intend<00:05:20.740> to<00:05:20.800> eat<00:05:20.949> it<00:05:21.099> I<00:05:21.250> don't

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
if you don't intend to eat it I don't

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.809 
if you don't intend to eat it I don't
know<00:05:22.440> I<00:05:23.440> mean<00:05:23.590> I<00:05:23.740> think<00:05:23.800> evolution<00:05:24.310> and

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:24.819 
know I mean I think evolution and

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:25.830 
know I mean I think evolution and
animals<00:05:25.120> have<00:05:25.240> figured<00:05:25.539> it<00:05:25.629> out<00:05:25.719> I<00:05:25.780> don't

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
animals have figured it out I don't

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.959 
animals have figured it out I don't
think<00:05:25.960> we<00:05:26.139> need<00:05:26.229> to<00:05:26.349> intervene<00:05:26.680> but<00:05:27.520> sometimes

00:05:27.959 --> 00:05:27.969 
think we need to intervene but sometimes

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:30.899 
think we need to intervene but sometimes
I<00:05:28.120> understand<00:05:28.509> that<00:05:28.659> it's<00:05:28.810> yeah<00:05:29.370> anyway<00:05:30.370> look

00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:30.909 
I understand that it's yeah anyway look

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:32.580 
I understand that it's yeah anyway look
at<00:05:31.030> this<00:05:31.270> is<00:05:31.389> just<00:05:31.569> one<00:05:31.719> of<00:05:31.750> a<00:05:31.930> number<00:05:32.110> of<00:05:32.259> lines

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
at this is just one of a number of lines

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.260 
at this is just one of a number of lines
that's<00:05:32.949> killed<00:05:33.159> every<00:05:33.490> single<00:05:33.699> year<00:05:34.090> their

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
that's killed every single year their

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.300 
that's killed every single year their
numbers<00:05:34.539> have<00:05:34.750> dwindled<00:05:34.979> significantly<00:05:35.979> some

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
numbers have dwindled significantly some

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:37.670 
numbers have dwindled significantly some
people<00:05:36.580> are<00:05:36.669> estimating<00:05:37.120> that<00:05:37.210> there's<00:05:37.360> about

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
people are estimating that there's about

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.260 
people are estimating that there's about
30,000<00:05:38.680> lions<00:05:38.860> left<00:05:39.279> in<00:05:39.460> the<00:05:39.550> world<00:05:39.759> I'm<00:05:40.060> sure

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
30,000 lions left in the world I'm sure

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.490 
30,000 lions left in the world I'm sure
that<00:05:40.389> it's<00:05:40.509> hard<00:05:40.690> to<00:05:40.779> get<00:05:40.900> an<00:05:40.990> exact<00:05:41.319> number

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
that it's hard to get an exact number

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.409 
that it's hard to get an exact number
but<00:05:42.130> we<00:05:42.219> do<00:05:42.370> also<00:05:42.550> know<00:05:42.880> from<00:05:43.120> past

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
but we do also know from past

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:45.600 
but we do also know from past
experiments<00:05:43.930> where<00:05:44.409> they<00:05:44.590> had<00:05:44.740> shut<00:05:45.159> down<00:05:45.370> all

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.610 
experiments where they had shut down all

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.730 
experiments where they had shut down all
hunting<00:05:46.060> in<00:05:46.150> the<00:05:46.240> area<00:05:46.289> around<00:05:47.289> some<00:05:47.529> of<00:05:47.560> these

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
hunting in the area around some of these

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.920 
hunting in the area around some of these
places<00:05:48.039> in<00:05:48.310> Zimbabwe<00:05:48.880> that<00:05:49.060> the<00:05:49.449> numbers<00:05:49.750> had

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
places in Zimbabwe that the numbers had

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.959 
places in Zimbabwe that the numbers had
rebounded<00:05:50.259> by<00:05:50.650> like<00:05:50.830> 50<00:05:51.190> percent<00:05:51.550> of<00:05:51.669> after

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:51.969 
rebounded by like 50 percent of after

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:53.550 
rebounded by like 50 percent of after
just<00:05:52.150> a<00:05:52.240> few<00:05:52.270> years<00:05:52.449> and<00:05:52.870> then<00:05:53.319> they

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
just a few years and then they

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.709 
just a few years and then they
reintroduced<00:05:54.430> hunting<00:05:54.880> in<00:05:55.029> some<00:05:55.270> cases

00:05:55.709 --> 00:05:55.719 
reintroduced hunting in some cases

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:56.969 
reintroduced hunting in some cases
perhaps<00:05:55.960> they<00:05:56.349> should<00:05:56.590> they<00:05:56.949> should

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:56.979 
perhaps they should they should

00:05:56.979 --> 00:05:58.920 
perhaps they should they should
eliminate<00:05:57.490> it<00:05:57.580> entirely<00:05:57.909> for<00:05:58.389> the<00:05:58.419> Lions<00:05:58.779> at

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930 
eliminate it entirely for the Lions at

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.589 
eliminate it entirely for the Lions at
the<00:05:59.020> very<00:05:59.199> least<00:05:59.380> anyway<00:06:00.310> that's<00:06:00.940> the<00:06:01.180> case<00:06:01.360> of

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:01.599 
the very least anyway that's the case of

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:03.930 
the very least anyway that's the case of
Cecil<00:06:01.960> the<00:06:01.990> lion<00:06:02.199> will<00:06:02.529> see<00:06:02.800> what<00:06:03.430> long-term

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
Cecil the lion will see what long-term

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.700 
Cecil the lion will see what long-term
effects<00:06:04.270> this<00:06:04.389> actually<00:06:04.840> has<00:06:05.050> for<00:06:05.349> the<00:06:05.409> area

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.589 
effects this actually has for the area
