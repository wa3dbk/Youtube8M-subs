so<00:00:00.659> I<00:00:00.690> got<00:00:00.840> my<00:00:00.930> SSD<00:00:01.380> and<00:00:01.829> I<00:00:01.920> got<00:00:02.070> my<00:00:02.220> cash<00:00:02.510> so

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:04.220 
so I got my SSD and I got my cash so

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.970 
so I got my SSD and I got my cash so
maybe<00:00:05.220> it's<00:00:05.430> like<00:00:06.170> you've<00:00:07.170> won<00:00:07.319> a<00:00:07.379> picture<00:00:07.830> of

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
maybe it's like you've won a picture of

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.990 
maybe it's like you've won a picture of
like<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.490> Queen<00:00:08.730> on<00:00:08.970> your<00:00:09.540> SSD<00:00:09.840> and<00:00:10.170> then<00:00:10.290> oh

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:11.000 
like the Queen on your SSD and then oh

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.820 
like the Queen on your SSD and then oh
not<00:00:12.000> that<00:00:12.179> kind<00:00:12.240> of<00:00:12.719> cash<00:00:13.080> we're<00:00:13.530> talking

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
not that kind of cash we're talking

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.099 
not that kind of cash we're talking
about<00:00:14.040> cash<00:00:14.340> storage<00:00:15.030> so<00:00:15.480> it<00:00:15.599> starts<00:00:15.870> with<00:00:15.929> the

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
about cash storage so it starts with the

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.930 
about cash storage so it starts with the
CPU<00:00:16.590> where<00:00:16.770> there's<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:16.980> tiny<00:00:17.340> little<00:00:17.609> bit<00:00:17.820> of

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
CPU where there's a tiny little bit of

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.000 
CPU where there's a tiny little bit of
storage<00:00:18.240> that<00:00:18.720> is<00:00:18.779> lightning<00:00:19.560> fast<00:00:19.770> we're

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
storage that is lightning fast we're

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.040 
storage that is lightning fast we're
talking<00:00:20.310> nanoseconds<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.330> most<00:00:21.539> frequently

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
talking nanoseconds the most frequently

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.960

used<00:00:22.140> data<00:00:22.500> that<00:00:22.710> your<00:00:22.830> computer<00:00:23.250> needs<00:00:23.490> goes

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.880 
used data that your computer needs goes
there<00:00:24.330> next<00:00:24.869> up<00:00:24.990> we've<00:00:25.170> got<00:00:25.199> RAM<00:00:25.650> which<00:00:25.859> is

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
there next up we've got RAM which is

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.849 
there next up we've got RAM which is
orders<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:26.430> magnitude<00:00:27.029> more<00:00:27.060> storage<00:00:27.779> but<00:00:28.170> is

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
orders of magnitude more storage but is

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.910 
orders of magnitude more storage but is
not<00:00:29.070> nearly<00:00:29.400> as<00:00:29.609> fast<00:00:29.760> as<00:00:30.029> CPU<00:00:30.359> cache<00:00:30.660> but<00:00:31.439> it's

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
not nearly as fast as CPU cache but it's

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.610 
not nearly as fast as CPU cache but it's
much<00:00:32.430> faster<00:00:32.700> than<00:00:33.149> this<00:00:33.750> guy<00:00:33.899> right<00:00:34.200> here<00:00:34.440> so

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
much faster than this guy right here so

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.930 
much faster than this guy right here so
most<00:00:34.890> computers<00:00:35.399> are<00:00:35.520> still<00:00:35.730> running

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
most computers are still running

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.840 
most computers are still running
mechanical<00:00:36.570> hard<00:00:36.750> drives<00:00:37.020> which<00:00:37.590> are<00:00:37.890> again

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
mechanical hard drives which are again

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.150 
mechanical hard drives which are again
orders<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.480> magnitude<00:00:39.960> larger<00:00:40.469> in<00:00:40.800> terms<00:00:40.829> of

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
orders of magnitude larger in terms of

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.010 
orders of magnitude larger in terms of
capacity<00:00:41.340> than<00:00:41.940> something<00:00:42.180> like<00:00:42.390> memory<00:00:42.719> but

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
capacity than something like memory but

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.220 
capacity than something like memory but
orders<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.620> magnitude<00:00:44.100> slower<00:00:44.579> as<00:00:45.059> well<00:00:45.690> so

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
orders of magnitude slower as well so

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.500 
orders of magnitude slower as well so
we're<00:00:46.590> an<00:00:46.680> SSD<00:00:46.980> cache<00:00:47.340> comes<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.030> it's<00:00:48.360> kind

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
we're an SSD cache comes in is it's kind

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.389 
we're an SSD cache comes in is it's kind
of<00:00:48.539> like<00:00:48.690> strapping<00:00:49.530> something<00:00:49.980> that's<00:00:50.160> in

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
of like strapping something that's in

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.790 
of like strapping something that's in
between<00:00:50.579> RAM<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.539> in<00:00:51.989> between<00:00:52.379> mechanical

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800

between RAM and in between mechanical
hard<00:00:53.309> drives<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:54.149> this<00:00:54.329> solution<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:55.050> the

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
hard drives to this solution so the

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.560 
hard drives to this solution so the
system<00:00:55.530> can<00:00:55.559> dynamically<00:00:56.570> automatically

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
system can dynamically automatically

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.510 
system can dynamically automatically
intelligently<00:00:58.320> take<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.949> data<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.399> it

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
intelligently take the data that it

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.750 
intelligently take the data that it
needs<00:00:59.550> most<00:01:00.480> often<00:01:01.020> but<00:01:01.230> not<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:02.129> often<00:01:02.609> and

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
needs most often but not that often and

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.390 
needs most often but not that often and
keep<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.390> on<00:01:03.539> an<00:01:03.719> SSD<00:01:04.049> drive<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:04.979> great

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
keep it on an SSD drive this is great

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.399 
keep it on an SSD drive this is great
for<00:01:05.729> at<00:01:05.880> things<00:01:06.150> like<00:01:06.240> applications<00:01:07.170> or<00:01:07.380> games

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
for at things like applications or games

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.800 
for at things like applications or games
where<00:01:08.369> it's<00:01:08.490> huge<00:01:08.909> amounts<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.330> data<00:01:09.540> but<00:01:09.689> you

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
where it's huge amounts of data but you

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.929 
where it's huge amounts of data but you
still<00:01:10.140> want<00:01:10.380> lightning-fast<00:01:11.340> loading<00:01:11.790> time

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
still want lightning-fast loading time

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.670 
still want lightning-fast loading time
now<00:01:12.150> this<00:01:12.330> solution<00:01:12.479> obviously<00:01:13.229> isn't<00:01:13.380> great

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
now this solution obviously isn't great

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.050 
now this solution obviously isn't great
for<00:01:13.860> something<00:01:14.040> like<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.280> notebook<00:01:14.610> where<00:01:14.939> you

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
for something like a notebook where you

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.730 
for something like a notebook where you
have<00:01:15.180> two<00:01:15.360> separate<00:01:15.780> drives<00:01:16.080> going<00:01:16.409> into<00:01:16.650> the

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
have two separate drives going into the

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.770 
have two separate drives going into the
device<00:01:17.009> but<00:01:17.700> what<00:01:17.909> if<00:01:18.060> we<00:01:18.180> had<00:01:18.330> something<00:01:18.360> that

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
device but what if we had something that

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.929 
device but what if we had something that
integrated<00:01:19.619> both<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.310> these<00:01:20.430> concepts

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
integrated both of these concepts

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.270 
integrated both of these concepts
together<00:01:21.450> in<00:01:21.689> one<00:01:22.110> small<00:01:22.470> device<00:01:22.619> so<00:01:22.979> this<00:01:23.100> is

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
together in one small device so this is

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.760 
together in one small device so this is
a<00:01:23.310> Seagate<00:01:23.759> momentous<00:01:24.479> drive<00:01:24.810> this<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.530> what's

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
a Seagate momentous drive this is what's

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.880 
a Seagate momentous drive this is what's
called<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.280> hybrid<00:01:26.700> drive<00:01:27.210> or<00:01:27.479> an<00:01:27.869> sshd
