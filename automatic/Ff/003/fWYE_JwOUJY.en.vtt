tumultuous time for metamoris you know
it's<00:00:57.329> an<00:00:57.420> expensive<00:00:57.989> endeavor<00:00:58.140> but<00:00:59.120> as<00:01:00.120> long

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
it's an expensive endeavor but as long

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.700

as<00:01:00.480> they<00:01:00.600> have<00:01:00.780> shows<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.199> think<00:01:01.379> there's<00:01:01.620> going

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
as they have shows I think there's going

as they have shows I think there's going
to<00:01:01.770> be<00:01:01.829> an<00:01:01.980> audience<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.579> know<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.210> have

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
to be an audience you know you and have

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.690 
to be an audience you know you and have
the<00:01:03.899> crossover<00:01:04.379> from<00:01:04.769> mixed<00:01:05.070> martial<00:01:05.430> arts

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
the crossover from mixed martial arts

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.640 
the crossover from mixed martial arts
into<00:01:06.060> grappling<00:01:06.479> makes<00:01:06.659> perfect<00:01:07.080> sense<00:01:07.200> the

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
into grappling makes perfect sense the

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.840 
into grappling makes perfect sense the
last<00:01:07.860> show<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.100> think<00:01:08.340> was<00:01:08.430> Chael<00:01:08.640> Sonnen

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
last show I think was Chael Sonnen

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.330 
last show I think was Chael Sonnen
versus<00:01:09.270> Andre<00:01:09.689> Galvao<00:01:10.070> Galvan<00:01:11.070> one<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.280> the

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
versus Andre Galvao Galvan one of the

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.530 
versus Andre Galvao Galvan one of the
best<00:01:11.490> grapplers<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.000> world<00:01:12.150> but<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.330> like

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
best grapplers in the world but I like

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.120 
best grapplers in the world but I like
this<00:01:12.689> matchup<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.560> think<00:01:13.770> they<00:01:13.860> need<00:01:14.040> to

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
this matchup and I think they need to

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.280 
this matchup and I think they need to
have<00:01:14.280> more<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.850> this<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.270> mean<00:01:15.450> just<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.960> idea

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
have more of this I mean just the idea

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.679 
have more of this I mean just the idea
of<00:01:16.380> Ronda<00:01:16.740> Rousey<00:01:17.100> or<00:01:17.220> cyborg<00:01:17.820> involved<00:01:18.570> in

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
of Ronda Rousey or cyborg involved in

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.010 
of Ronda Rousey or cyborg involved in
grappling<00:01:18.930> matches<00:01:19.470> we<00:01:19.890> heard<00:01:20.040> Gabby<00:01:20.310> Garcia

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
grappling matches we heard Gabby Garcia

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.050 
grappling matches we heard Gabby Garcia
challenge<00:01:22.020> Ronda<00:01:22.380> Rousey<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:23.640> would<00:01:23.939> love

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
challenge Ronda Rousey and I would love

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
challenge Ronda Rousey and I would love
to<00:01:24.240> see<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.540> course<00:01:24.659> there's<00:01:24.930> such<00:01:25.049> a

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
to see it of course there's such a

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.810 
to see it of course there's such a
weight<00:01:25.560> discrepancy<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.310> don't<00:01:26.549> know<00:01:26.610> if<00:01:26.700> that

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
weight discrepancy I don't know if that

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.580 
weight discrepancy I don't know if that
match<00:01:26.970> whatever<00:01:27.240> makes<00:01:27.450> sense<00:01:27.540> but<00:01:27.930> right<00:01:28.439> now

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
match whatever makes sense but right now

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.380 
match whatever makes sense but right now
is<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.829> good<00:01:29.040> time<00:01:29.100> for<00:01:29.280> for<00:01:29.820> grappling<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.329> I

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
the problem is you know there's there is

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.880 
the problem is you know there's there is
a<00:02:13.200> divide

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
a divide

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.440 
a divide
cuz<00:02:14.010> you<00:02:14.460> know<00:02:14.550> Shannon<00:02:15.120> had<00:02:15.240> his

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
cuz you know Shannon had his

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.880 
cuz you know Shannon had his
opportunities<00:02:16.080> he's<00:02:16.319> faced<00:02:16.530> some<00:02:16.740> of<00:02:16.800> the

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
opportunities he's faced some of the

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.559 
opportunities he's faced some of the
best<00:02:17.069> guys<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.460> he<00:02:17.520> always<00:02:17.730> kind<00:02:18.000> of<00:02:18.120> comes<00:02:18.360> up

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
best guys and he always kind of comes up

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.020 
best guys and he always kind of comes up
short<00:02:18.840> but<00:02:19.350> he<00:02:19.410> always<00:02:19.950> creates<00:02:20.370> interest<00:02:20.819> and

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
short but he always creates interest and

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.850 
short but he always creates interest and
I<00:02:21.060> think<00:02:21.240> you<00:02:21.330> give<00:02:21.630> Chael<00:02:21.870> Sonnen<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.620> right

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
I think you give Chael Sonnen the right

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.550 
I think you give Chael Sonnen the right
matchups<00:02:23.459> that<00:02:23.730> he<00:02:24.180> can<00:02:24.360> sell<00:02:24.630> fights<00:02:24.990> and<00:02:25.290> I

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
matchups that he can sell fights and I

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.020 
matchups that he can sell fights and I
think<00:02:25.770> people<00:02:25.980> want<00:02:26.160> to<00:02:26.250> tune<00:02:26.400> in<00:02:26.520> to<00:02:26.670> see<00:02:26.700> him

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
think people want to tune in to see him

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.090 
think people want to tune in to see him
but<00:02:27.240> on<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.750> broadcast<00:02:27.990> side<00:02:28.440> I<00:02:28.500> mean<00:02:28.740> he's

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
but on the broadcast side I mean he's

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.560 
but on the broadcast side I mean he's
good<00:02:29.280> to<00:02:29.400> go<00:02:29.520> people<00:02:29.790> want<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.270> hear<00:02:30.420> what

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
good to go people want to hear what

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.240 
good to go people want to hear what
Chael<00:02:30.750> Sonnen<00:02:30.990> has<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.380> say<00:02:31.709> he's<00:02:32.130> an

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
Chael Sonnen has to say he's an

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.040 
Chael Sonnen has to say he's an
interesting<00:02:32.670> character<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:33.540> I<00:02:33.570> think<00:02:33.990> he

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
interesting character and I think he

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.440 
interesting character and I think he
always<00:02:34.290> adds<00:02:34.709> to<00:02:34.950> any<00:02:35.190> broadcast<00:02:35.550> he's<00:02:36.090> a<00:02:36.120> part

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
always adds to any broadcast he's a part

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.330 
always adds to any broadcast he's a part
of<00:02:36.570> so<00:02:37.080> Chael<00:02:37.350> Sonnen<00:02:37.560> is<00:02:37.800> one<00:02:37.920> of<00:02:38.040> these<00:02:38.130> guys

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
of so Chael Sonnen is one of these guys

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.449 
of so Chael Sonnen is one of these guys
that<00:02:38.400> really<00:02:38.880> has<00:02:39.720> built<00:02:40.320> a<00:02:40.500> career<00:02:40.739> inside<00:02:41.340> of

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
that really has built a career inside of

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.640 
that really has built a career inside of
the<00:02:41.520> Octagon<00:02:41.850> that<00:02:42.209> will<00:02:42.390> allow<00:02:43.110> him<00:02:43.380> to<00:02:43.410> have

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
the Octagon that will allow him to have

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.040 
the Octagon that will allow him to have
a<00:02:43.920> future<00:02:44.340> outside<00:02:44.520> of<00:02:44.940> it<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:45.090> I<00:02:45.390> think<00:02:45.450> you

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
a future outside of it and I think you

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.330 
a future outside of it and I think you

organization she has her own sponsors

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.230 
organization she has her own sponsors
she<00:06:03.560> can<00:06:03.830> make<00:06:04.040> a<00:06:04.220> lot<00:06:04.550> of<00:06:04.580> money<00:06:04.940> by<00:06:05.180> staying
