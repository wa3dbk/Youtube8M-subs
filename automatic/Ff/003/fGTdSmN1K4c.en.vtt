what's<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.220> reasoning<00:02:26.760> between<00:02:27.500> educating

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
what's the reasoning between educating

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.350 
what's the reasoning between educating
the<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.920> groups<00:02:29.160> independently<00:02:29.820> we<00:02:30.150> have

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
the the groups independently we have

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.550 
the the groups independently we have
there<00:02:30.570> are<00:02:30.630> many<00:02:30.750> activities<00:02:31.320> that<00:02:31.440> the

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
there are many activities that the

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
families do together but then also the

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.870 
families do together but then also the
fathers<00:02:34.170> are<00:02:34.500> spoken<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.190> separately<00:02:35.670> and

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
then the mothers are spoken to

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.080 
then the mothers are spoken to
separately<00:02:37.380> and<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.920> children<00:02:38.670> are<00:02:38.760> spoken

to<00:02:39.180> separately<00:02:39.540> then<00:02:39.750> they<00:02:39.840> all<00:02:39.930> come

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
to separately then they all come

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.510 
to separately then they all come
together<00:02:40.260> again<00:02:40.560> for<00:02:40.920> other<00:02:41.160> group

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
together again for other group

activities what's the reasoning behind

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.280 
activities what's the reasoning behind
that<00:02:43.830> that's<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.370> very<00:02:44.550> good<00:02:44.700> question

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
that that's a very good question

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.830 
there and it's just like if they don't
do<00:03:37.590> it<00:03:37.800> but<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.850> parent<00:03:39.209> I<00:03:39.300> mean<00:03:39.420> the<00:03:39.510> children

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
do it but the parent I mean the children

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.030 
do it but the parent I mean the children
will<00:03:39.959> look<00:03:40.110> at<00:03:40.260> them<00:03:40.380> like<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.680> father<00:03:40.890> or

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
will look at them like the father or

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.350 
will look at them like the father or
mother<00:03:41.160> why<00:03:41.310> haven't<00:03:41.670> we<00:03:41.700> been<00:03:41.790> doing<00:03:42.239> this

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
mother why haven't we been doing this

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.720 
mother why haven't we been doing this
yet<00:03:42.600> so<00:03:42.840> we<00:03:43.620> don't<00:03:43.650> want<00:03:43.950> to<00:03:44.010> embarrass<00:03:44.130> them

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
yet so we don't want to embarrass them

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.540 
yet so we don't want to embarrass them
at<00:03:44.880> all<00:03:45.060> but<00:03:45.300> I<00:03:45.510> think<00:03:45.630> it<00:03:45.930> really<00:03:46.140> shows<00:03:46.550> the

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
at all but I think it really shows the

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.970 
at all but I think it really shows the
independence<00:03:48.180> of<00:03:48.330> the<00:03:49.110> vocation<00:03:49.590> itself<00:03:49.860> it's

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
independence of the vocation itself it's

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.830 
independence of the vocation itself it's
a<00:03:50.040> call<00:03:50.250> from<00:03:50.400> God<00:03:50.610> surely<00:03:50.940> the<00:03:51.239> parents

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
a call from God surely the parents

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.410 
a call from God surely the parents
foster<00:03:52.500> it<00:03:52.620> but<00:03:53.250> they<00:03:53.580> don't<00:03:53.790> choose<00:03:54.150> the

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
foster it but they don't choose the

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.199 
foster it but they don't choose the
vocation<00:03:54.930> to<00:03:54.959> their<00:03:55.350> to<00:03:55.590> their<00:03:56.220> children<00:03:56.730> so

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
vocation to their to their children so

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.120 
vocation to their to their children so
that's<00:03:57.300> why<00:03:57.450> we<00:03:57.600> split<00:03:57.780> them<00:03:57.959> up<00:03:58.050> just<00:03:58.290> it's

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
that's why we split them up just it's

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.040 
that's why we split them up just it's
good<00:03:59.370> to<00:03:59.790> we<00:04:00.209> all<00:04:00.330> get<00:04:00.510> together<00:04:00.630> from<00:04:00.870> Mass

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
good to we all get together from Mass

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.600 
good to we all get together from Mass
obviously<00:04:01.500> the<00:04:01.560> prayer<00:04:01.770> of<00:04:01.980> a<00:04:02.040> communion<00:04:02.520> of

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
obviously the prayer of a communion of

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.880 
obviously the prayer of a communion of
the<00:04:02.910> church<00:04:03.270> for<00:04:03.900> adoration<00:04:04.440> and<00:04:04.560> so<00:04:04.680> forth

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
the church for adoration and so forth

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.500 
the church for adoration and so forth
but<00:04:05.010> for<00:04:05.040> the<00:04:05.280> talks<00:04:05.520> we<00:04:05.730> could<00:04:05.880> keep<00:04:06.120> it<00:04:06.300> that

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
but for the talks we could keep it that

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.240 
but for the talks we could keep it that
way<00:04:06.540> I<00:04:07.080> think<00:04:07.410> it'll<00:04:07.530> work<00:04:07.590> out<00:04:07.890> better<00:04:08.130> that

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
way I think it'll work out better that

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.979 
way I think it'll work out better that
way<00:04:08.520> so<00:04:08.580> ok<00:04:09.450> very<00:04:09.690> good

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
way so ok very good

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.500 
way so ok very good
