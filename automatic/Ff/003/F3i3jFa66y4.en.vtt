00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
100k that's pretty much you know my I

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.400 
100k that's pretty much you know my I
guess<00:00:27.090> my<00:00:27.240> goal<00:00:27.420> at<00:00:27.570> this<00:00:27.689> point<00:00:28.019> is<00:00:28.170> just<00:00:28.199> to

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
guess my goal at this point is just to

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.250 
guess my goal at this point is just to
slowly<00:00:29.279> get<00:00:29.550> Lutz<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:30.000> are<00:00:30.119> decently<00:00:31.019> better

than<00:00:31.410> I've<00:00:31.500> gotten<00:00:31.710> so<00:00:31.920> far<00:00:32.099> which<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.460> guess<00:00:32.640> is

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
than I've gotten so far which I guess is

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.069 
than I've gotten so far which I guess is
a<00:00:32.820> really<00:00:33.120> stupid<00:00:33.329> goal<00:00:33.630> because<00:00:33.840> that's<00:00:33.989> what

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
a really stupid goal because that's what

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.900 
a really stupid goal because that's what
everybody's<00:00:34.410> goal<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:34.739> but<00:00:35.309> so<00:00:35.460> apparently<00:00:35.820> my

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
everybody's goal is but so apparently my

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.240 
everybody's goal is but so apparently my

axe<00:01:04.110> longsword<00:01:04.799> helm<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:06.650> 76,000<00:01:07.650> 785

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
axe longsword helm so the 76,000 785

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.950 
axe longsword helm so the 76,000 785
which<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.850> more<00:01:09.060> than<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.240> average<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.869> the

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
which is more than the average of the

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.140 
which is more than the average of the
series<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:10.350> far<00:01:10.380> so<00:01:10.860> okay<00:01:11.220> now<00:01:11.549> we'll<00:01:11.729> take<00:01:11.939> it

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
series so far so okay now we'll take it

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.149 
series so far so okay now we'll take it
so<00:01:12.390> there<00:01:12.420> we<00:01:12.630> have<00:01:12.659> month<00:01:12.960> amo<00:01:13.200> from<00:01:13.500> day<00:01:13.710> 19

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
so there we have month amo from day 19

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.359 
so there we have month amo from day 19
we're<00:01:14.310> going<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.490> fade<00:01:14.729> in<00:01:14.909> did<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.659> torn<00:01:16.350> knee<00:01:17.130> I

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
we're going to fade in did a torn knee I

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.630 
we're going to fade in did a torn knee I
actually<00:01:17.610> aligned<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:19.250> images<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.280> bit<00:01:20.460> more

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
actually aligned the images a bit more

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.820 
actually aligned the images a bit more
now<00:01:20.790> so<00:01:21.060> it's<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.240> bit<00:01:21.390> straighter<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:22.650> that's

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
now so it's a bit straighter so that's

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.249 
now so it's a bit straighter so that's
why<00:01:22.950> oh<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:23.460> did<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.030> bit<00:01:24.270> differently<00:01:24.630> there<00:01:24.810> but

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
why oh I did a bit differently there but

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.690 
why oh I did a bit differently there but
yes<00:01:25.590> really<00:01:25.830> have<00:01:25.950> 1,000,000<00:01:26.580> 280<00:01:27.590> 1291<00:01:28.700> GP

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
yes really have 1,000,000 280 1291 GP

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.859 
yes really have 1,000,000 280 1291 GP
from<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:30.030> series<00:01:30.299> so<00:01:30.420> far<00:01:30.450> I<00:01:30.630> actually

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
from this series so far I actually

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.170 
from this series so far I actually
didn't<00:01:31.200> have<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.380> add<00:01:31.439> any<00:01:31.710> new<00:01:31.860> items<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.909> the

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
didn't have to add any new items to the

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.210 
didn't have to add any new items to the
picture<00:01:33.780> because<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.320> already<00:01:34.530> had<00:01:34.799> them<00:01:34.979> for

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
picture because I already had them for

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.830 
picture because I already had them for
hard<00:01:35.430> clues<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:35.970> pretty<00:01:36.210> cool<00:01:36.329> stuff<00:01:36.509> anyways

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
hard clues so pretty cool stuff anyways
