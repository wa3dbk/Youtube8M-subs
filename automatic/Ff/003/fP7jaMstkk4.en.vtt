00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.309
 good morning to all girls my name is 

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:12.049
 jenny are a beauty blogger ii a 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.239
 channel on youtube dedicated 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:16.369
 mainly to the nika that I am here today 

00:00:14.239 --> 00:00:18.410
 with the feminine dot com to reveal you 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.750
 some tricks on how to have lips 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.039
 more fleshy and more voluminous unfortunately 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.380
 not everyone is lucky enough to have 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.910
 of the beautiful blue rose full lips 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.659
 from birth then the trick can 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:32.689
 help us correct this 

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:35.090
 first after removing each 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.340
 lipstick residue gloss pencils with one 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.649
 I go to get a scrub 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.379
 lips that has the task of going to 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.660
 eliminate those unsightly cuticles 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:45.230
 that form on the lips 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.210
 daily basis 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.340
 there are several on the market of 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.399
 these scrubs but you can also make them 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.190
 a natural homemade one is a lot 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:57.109
 simple just take a teaspoon of 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.859
 honey a teaspoon of brown sugar 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:02.030
 mixed products together then go to 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:04.280
 rub them on the lips and certainly 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.420
 the lips will be much softer and 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.420
 without happy 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.530
 what then to remove the residues of the 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.460
 scrub with a make-up remover with a 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.460
 cotton pad 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.900
 Now let's move on to the next step 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.180
 go and apply a lip balm 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.520
 I recommend making these two meals 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.890
 that is, the scrub and the balm the night before 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.660
 of when you want to go realize the 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.730
 makeup because in this way the balm 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:45.810
 lips will have all night to act for 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:47.670
 deeply nourish and moisturize your lips now 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.590
 let's move on to the actual make-up for 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.260
 the lips I pay you to take as before 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.360
 what a pencil with blue I go to 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.640
 outline the external contour of the 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.380
 so I go to illuminate lips 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.720
 this area and the lips stretch out 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.720
 visibly more voluminous 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.650
 the concentrates above all those 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.650
 on the water of cupid 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.849
 and now I'm going to blend everything with everything 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.870
 pass again a little on the arc of 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.989
 cupid more important to blend well the 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.989
 machine 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:30.890
 now let's move on to another pencil or 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.810
 the lip pencil 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.209
 in this case I go to get one 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.340
 flesh-colored pencil that draws a lot of the 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.250
 color of my lips and I go to 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.260
 spread it on the lip contour and mi 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.450
 move slightly outwards 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.150
 But do not overdo it too much because 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.629
 otherwise you will see a lot of effect 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.739
 false 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:51.950
 instead we want to give an effect 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.510
 very natural and naturally to do 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.090
 look like bigger lips then 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.110
 I follow the lip contour and move 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.110
 slightly outwards 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.370
 now I'm going to fade the pencil towards 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.370
 the interior 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:17.070
 now let's move on to the lipstick and go to 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.080
 take a lipstick that is of a 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.020
 color really very similar to the pencil 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.840
 because it is not very aesthetic to see the 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:27.000
 dark pencil that the lipstick inside 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.100
 clear so I'm going to choose a 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.780
 lipstick that is very very similar to 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.060
 color of the pencil I have 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.250
 previously applied in this case 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.740
 I'm going to pick one opaque so that a 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.230
 a xoom a matte effect and I go to 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:43.940
 spread it with a lip brush 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.940
 in order to be more precise 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.640
 I'm going to pick up the product 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:54.310
 directly from the packaging and then 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:57.640
 I start from the center and approach the edges 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:00.600
 of the lips stopping obviously where 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.600
 I applied the pencil 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.400
 to conclude, I'm going to get a 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.190
 blog you can choose a gloss 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.450
 transparent or as in my case 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:13.750
 slightly colored that recalls 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.550
 just the color of the lipstick as well 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.730
 go and apply it on all lips 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:20.470
 if you really want an effect 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:24.600
 volumizing or doing as I do 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.600
 apply it only to the center 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.460
 in this case I went to 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.830
 apply a normal gloss but exist 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.630
 also glosses on the market 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.580
 volumizing so they are big 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.740
 generally transparent but there are 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.480
 even colored, if desired, apply 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.820
 on the lips feel a slight 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.130
 prickle ior and from there you understand that 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.890
 lips are slightly swelling 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.990
 obviously it's a minimum ceiling it's not that 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.900
 you will have lips then at the dinghy will be one 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.970
 quite naturally then these 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.280
 are my tips to make it look like the 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.290
 lips a little fleshier, more voluminous 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.690
 if you don't already have fleshy beautiful ones of 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:07.610
 yours I hope this video is there 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.910
 interested and see you next time 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.910
