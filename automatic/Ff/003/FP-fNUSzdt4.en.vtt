00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:09.380
 Oh, 3d max 2011 Plan stereoscopic picture together too weak to look at 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:12.530
 Please teach me how to sharpen it Now 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:15.269
 There is no way to give the picture itself 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:19.680
 The picture is now 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:23.310
 Despite the goodness of the topic, it can be solved in Max 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:29.060
 Yes I'm a lift plan 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:34.689
 So what if Votto doejyo to drag graduated 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.689
 It's just that you have to look at the picture to see if it's an explorer . 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:46.900
 It's such a party do so in the example shown in Figure 2 Explorer 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:49.670
 If a small picture big picture if the original does not matter ve broken child 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:56.079
 It's originally broken. 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:56.079
 If you do not like this broken note in spite of the big pictures, 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.160
 Max 2012 and November 5 The same is true for 2013 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.760
 It's gone. 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:10.700
 So eat lots of bath Max 2014 has again 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:14.090
 If you have a preference for customizing the resolution, 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:17.720
 There is an Abi port tab so you can 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:20.270
 Graphics card Here you go to the display driver's 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.750
 It's a computer driver. 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:28.220
 So now that you're getting the quality from the viewport, 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:32.780
 The requirement now is to increase the quality of the first book in the background. 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:37.940
 Next, download the special size of the size of the book to say the right quality 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:42.590
 So if you want to raise this antenna up to now, 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:47.040
 Check this hasyeoseo Charles has secretly viewed clearly visible in wireframe 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:51.120
 You're doing it. The whole body viewport slows down. 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:55.620
 I know that increasing the smooth text size causes the viewport to slow down 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:57.090
 In fact, the size of the stone recalls the background Tech beat rather than the port speed slower 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:01.530
 When you heighten 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:07.020
 Whether the graphics card has a load on its memory 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:11.760
 Well, not that much to look no apparent where the best green Size Well 8002 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:16.680
 Background 1024 Gore Texture Mapping This is a five day 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:21.630
 The graphics that will slow down because this is not so high here and here 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.700
 Can I cards if the car can not be in 3d so speed is absolutely something you can experience 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:28.680
 I do not press enough 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:33.120
 So it looks like she's on the map. 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:37.530
 Then please check out more by looking at the size of the close of b love match team yogeol 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.570
 So, as long as possible, you can do that bitmap size and match 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.680
 I will show you . 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:46.860
 And then there's the Texel lookup and the map lookup . 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:51.060
 If you also need something that eopgoyo najil algorithmically 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:56.040
 It's fast, it's fast, it's bad quality. 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:59.850
 It slows down and slows down, but when it does not improve quality, 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:04.590
 If you do so, check that you are also called Tropic Ear 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:08.580
 The better the quality Im gonna set oo now related to wireframe 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:14.250
 I'll bruise you so I'll set it up and ok. 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:18.690
 I usually use it just like a little graphics card memory 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:23.100
 Hundreds of dogs are fewer objects are attached so that means at the next port on the b 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.630
 Shawn Levy, if it is visible in the port requirements and yogeo the equator to the car jjokkeum 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.230
 I can fly. 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.420
 So do you need to write yen usually pushes the ministry lc 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.020
 Yes 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:36.590
 It's much better . 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:41.590
 Then 2013 is gone. 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.590
 2014 times with a lot of reaction to be users 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:51.540
 Ji-hee came in . A little menu position came in elsewhere. 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:56.099
 Here, too zest tubes Tom had stopped to look at the same painting, 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:04:00.540
 Oh, he came in yesterday. Here's an adaptive d gradient. 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:03.840
 If the mx's object viewport speed is slow, it's time to quickly box it 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:08.250
 That such an option to show a little early and indeyo 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:10.109
 Adaptive Duration Right-click on the prayer 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:14.400
 It's so good now. 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:19.470
 The quality of being slow improvement in the quality of the probe assembly called Progress 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:23.610
 What we used to do with such technology gradually put an external streaming video 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:27.419
 Such technology suddenly gets bigger and better, and now it 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:31.979
 Especially you could need and suppress the side of the graphics card. 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:33.750
 It is baked flush jewel map Now that was something baking 3d map 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:37.800
 I'm going to talk about the quality 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:43.229
 Lumbar port in the background the end of the garment is going to end as it goes directly to the non-port 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:45.690
 Im glad itjyo map edaga wind gradient here haneungeo visible in the viewport 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:49.199
 I press rtp 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:53.699
 The dancing figure here chumyeon it.I thought in the second house background 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:57.120
 It is related to the quality you'll question now mapped to the source mapping plan 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:05:02.789
 Because I wanted to wear the sauce and make it look good . 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:06.960
 We can improve the quality even more than the drunken Thundermax Max 2011. 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:10.139
 Max 2012, for example, this picture is a cucumber 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:14.070
 It does not make much sense to get higher . But for example, the picture is 4000. 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:17.280
 So I really want to see it clearly, 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:20.759
 I could not increase 512 512 more per second 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:26.639
 Even when Max 2011 one think that what RAM is less so Article 5 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:30.150
 What is responsible for the system is the RAM system is responsible for the system g 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:34.320
 This mapping will obscure the source system is being loaded 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:39.120
 If there's enough system RAM, you have to eat it and raise it to no limit. 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:43.289
 Dwaeseo a single mail-ray will show loading to our eyes, but the graphics 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:44.430
 Even in memory, this resolution depends on the graphics in the 2 graphics memory 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:50.080
 Memory diagram 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:54.370
 I've involved but actually it is a greater involvement 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:06:00.009
 The system's RAM system memory is the head of McGee What are you guys when you're doing 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:06:03.939
 That'll have to talk about memory, so nowadays the graphics card is what you are doing 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:07.389
 If you are using a jewel monitor, I would use almost dual monitor. 

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:12.099
 If you write it, you better stick two or more. 

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:16.210
 If you write a single thing to change what group one but I have to shake off the memory of the graphics card 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:17.439
 Responsible thing itjyo just what the desktop resolution to 1920 to 1080 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:23.229
 This resolution 

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:27.400
 Yogi has absolutely no effect and the next texture is a bit 

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:31.870
 It affects, but what you're misunderstanding is this memory or something like this. 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:36.099
 The place where the object is loaded is the RAM. 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:40.030
 Our eyes seem to call this on the hard disk, but the hard disk 

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:45.190
 I do not write 4 pieces of stuff so I can wrap it in an unconditional 64 bit os 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:45.969
 Gotta have to spend again the maximum value that is supported by the boards self-sufficient Lemon 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:50.650
 I recommend 

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:54.250
 What much more must be good if not cheap, even 8GB of RAM-old doing four 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:58.270
 I've done 32 . 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:07:00.580
 You want to do a lot of heavy work . 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:04.389
 Thus, 2013 is the required value 

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:08.919
 I doubt it's what you want. 

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:12.840
 River safari beauty line If you do this and press ok, the picture quality of this picture 

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:16.520
 I can feel it getting much better. 

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.520
 I hope this answers your question.
