 I think it's a little over 60 inches and 55 inches. 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:11.990
 You'll see that much larger number of bigger screens this Friday in Sochi

 If you buy the screen by using the original project, the angle will shine a little. 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:42.890

 If you know far more about What itguyo to see bigger 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:09.550
