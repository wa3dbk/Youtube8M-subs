00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.220

 you will see I put rich block here and 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:49.849
 normally on iTunes it could be called 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.590
 could be called as rich ipod blogs but 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:54.050
 with this application makes only 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.599

 only that is called my name the only thing 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:00.440
 what do I have to do is to enable it 

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:02.260
 give back 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:06.190

 an extra bar here but this is like 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:34.370
 so they do not enter directly if 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:35.889
 you press something you are looking for example 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.300
