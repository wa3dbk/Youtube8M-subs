00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.840
 hello everyone with you gringo her heading 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:18.970
 pharma time by voting and determined 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.689
 what do you want to be a pioneer 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:25.330
 times tank eighth level fcm 50t 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.880
 This is a heavy tank France 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.070
 at the eighth level and in principle yes I am with 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.890
 you agree he is suitable for good 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.960
 farm at the end of the battle I will fail brief 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.210
 totals played I already 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.469
 fifty one fight and already half 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:43.600
 path to success and the end result 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.699
 Game session on this tank and let's 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.719
 let's see what the profitability depends 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:52.449
 tanks first and the lion's share belongs to 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:54.519
 damage the more you deal damage to those 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.769
 somewhere more get it right 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:58.870
 proportionally so if you bet 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:01.840
 the purpose of making a loan is 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.910
 damage in every way you lose everything 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.220
 equal damage anyway you 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.250
 get a lot of credit let's 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.560
 let's see what will help to cause damage 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.039
 innovations he has a good weapon and not 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.330
 said she was super duper but for 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:19.950
 premium technology it is excellent breakthrough 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:23.170
 armor piercing 212 good ammunition 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.910
 036 good accuracy but on the far 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.759
 distance course Kosovo but in principle 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.920
 we will meet going time 2 and 3 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.110
 Of course long but already so small 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.590
 standard for tanks so with this you can 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.920
 accept if you can charge gold 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.289
 but it is not necessary to drink from her 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.690
 259 that is, the gun helps what else 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:46.869
 help us deal a lot of damage of course 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.940
 the same timely occupation of a successful position 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.500
 for shooting 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:54.550
 the dynamics of our heavy tank 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.810
 excellent 18 horses on . 51 kilometer to 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.940
 hour and maximum speed 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.910
 in general, we occupy positions quickly 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.649
 also a good overview is 400 meters not 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.989
 peculiar to heavy tank on 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.569
 allows to detect tanks earlier than 

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:09.550
 will find you booking 120 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:11.220
 millimeters in the forehead of the tower and the hull is not 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.080
 gives us guaranteed 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.930
 breaks through us but still sometimes 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.780
 saves especially from guns and lungs 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.700
 tanks 6 levels so on and sometimes here 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.060
 the top of the tower flying projectile 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.920
 he must ricochet too, it is important 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.750
 because all the same dramatically not 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.340
 armor is not about this tank after all 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.410
 a little bit is also possible 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.100
 gank and harp and granite yet 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.530
 there are still a good tank to the bottom so 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.020
 You can play from the tower but of course in 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.170
 she can and shlopat what can 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:46.650
 prevent us from winning this tank in 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:49.740
 first this big tank down huge 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.450
 its everywhere visible and of course 120 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.730
 millimeters sometimes saves on more often not 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.700
 saves so if so healthy 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.860
 Sarajevo leaves and goes with him 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.630
 shoots your sarajevo about it 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.330
 know that is as soon as you glow and 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.670
 in the shot focus immediately on you that is 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.290
 don't forget about it 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.240
 a huge problem krits ammunition 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.209
 ammunition every third 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.190
 fourth fight and this is a big bo problem 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.750
 laying could arrange of course not 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.910
 need and but in principle can be replaced 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.370
 fire extinguisher for a large repair kit 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.440
 carry 2 repair kits but still then 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.390
 in case of fire you will be useless though so 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.100
 rarely lit 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.080
 what else makes it stand out among others 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.920
 First of all he has a preferential level 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.530
 battles 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.870
 it is of course super you more often in the top 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.690
 punching tanks easier does not kill you 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.180
 very quickly in general it's cool also 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:43.860
 The tank is very cheap shells for silver 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:46.890
 they cost 255 units of credits each and every 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.650
 it's great because it deals 240 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:53.400
 freak let's say ice 6 advice which 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.580
 deals 390 damage worth 1025 i.e. 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:01.450
 four times a 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:03.580
 or is it super cool but the tank play 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.500
 I specifically direct multiple sessions from 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.020
 big on him spent I would do here 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.510
 that the tank is very dependent on the command it 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:13.060
 platoon tank if you play platoon then 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.970
 you will show good results 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.920
 and since I set the basic conditions 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.260
 what I will play solo and see 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.730
 still winning percentage as john rounds 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.830
 I can say that I ran into 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.690
 problem because often fights 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.080
 pass like that in principle in this battle 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:32.020
 you have to leave your hastily 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.780
 positions are comfortable trying to look for a hit 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.550
 new run away and in general this 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.930
 going all over the place allies 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.480
 merge you can't 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.880
 oppose because there is no good 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.230
 Alpha up to exchange, let's say no 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.120
 armor to tank 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.740
 you can only shoot from afar 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.870
 the way the muse of light 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.750
 and since allies die do this 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:55.150
 In general, there are no problems for that 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:58.840
 percentage of wins depends somewhere percent 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:01.390
 at 40 from you and at 60 here your team 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:04.090
 if the team drags it all super if not 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.810
 then excuse the defeat additional 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.470
 equipment 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:10.270
 I fights 38 ventilation w treat dpm but 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.160
 then I realized that to detect the enemy and 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.410
 make a couple of shots on it before 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.630
 he shines you much more important therefore 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.870
 put the optics also put rammer 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.010
 and vertical alignment stabilizer 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.760
 Valiant type who helped me 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.310
 win 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.990
 before you now let's quickly 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:30.250
 go through the intermediate result 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:33.010
 percentage of wins 56 86 believe that percentage 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:35.080
 wins bad but since the tank team 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.430
 depends on and in principle I think that the norms 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:40.360
 need to try this parameter 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:43.180
 improve battles level 831 which means that 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.430
 I threw two times more often to the eight 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.950
 rather than nines to me of course 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:52.170
 convenient so the first server for 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:56.440
 from them tanks, in principle, comfort damage 2 

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:58.090
 190 this means not that every fight 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.070
 so much on the power I do not have any, and on the 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:02.590
 when I often force there more than 4000 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:04.260
 damage is good but when me 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.790
 just a team and merged 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.740
 just was green I was killed i 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:11.920
 merged there with 400 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:14.920
 I was ashamed of damage, but you and me too 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:19.570
 considered unfortunately therefore the average such 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:21.880
 damage experience 1111 good experience more 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:24.120
 my average naoki therefore principle 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:27.820
 no income average claims 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:31.090
 68 283 this income is just how much 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:33.880
 I received a maximum loan average of 68,000 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:37.360
 net income is the same minus all 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:39.850
 expenses 57000 462 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:43.120
 In principle, the result is quite good, we are almost 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:45.760
 each battle we get 60 thousand credits 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.810
 this is super this is good at reading something 

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.880
 good farm 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:51.880
 let's see what happens next 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.980
 this is all stay with me 

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.960
 subscribe and of course will 

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:58.450
 other results right everything will be super 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:00.550
 everything will be interesting put huskies and 

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:04.800
 wait for new videos with you was glen in 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:04.800
 Thank you all for watching so far.
