actually a standby operates which we

actually a standby operates which we

reverse engineered these schematics as I

reverse engineered these schematics as I
was<00:00:59.320> going<00:00:59.500> through<00:00:59.650> it<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:01.239> then<00:01:01.690> you<00:01:01.720> got

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:01.989 
was going through it and then you got

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:03.930 
was going through it and then you got
the<00:01:02.110> high<00:01:02.290> voltage<00:01:02.770> on<00:01:02.980> her<00:01:03.160> off<00:01:03.400> with<00:01:03.730> that

switch<00:01:04.890> actually<00:01:05.890> was<00:01:06.250> only<00:01:06.610> two<00:01:06.820> things

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
switch actually was only two things

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.750 
switch actually was only two things
wrong<00:01:07.360> with<00:01:07.690> it<00:01:07.750> and<00:01:08.170> the<00:01:09.100> only<00:01:09.190> reason<00:01:09.490> we

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
wrong with it and the only reason we

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.820 
wrong with it and the only reason we
went<00:01:09.970> through<00:01:10.270> it<00:01:10.420> is<00:01:10.570> we<00:01:10.780> had<00:01:10.960> a<00:01:10.990> buyer<00:01:11.320> Ford

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
went through it is we had a buyer Ford

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.430 
went through it is we had a buyer Ford
interested<00:01:12.400> in<00:01:12.550> it<00:01:12.729> but<00:01:12.940> when<00:01:13.869> he<00:01:13.960> found<00:01:14.170> out

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
interested in it but when he found out

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.730 
interested in it but when he found out
that<00:01:14.619> it<00:01:14.770> was<00:01:14.950> me<00:01:15.220> and<00:01:15.520> I<00:01:16.030> was<00:01:16.780> selling<00:01:17.440> it<00:01:17.530> as

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
that it was me and I was selling it as

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.010 
that it was me and I was selling it as
he<00:01:17.950> is<00:01:17.979> untested<00:01:18.580> he<00:01:18.970> decided<00:01:19.420> that<00:01:19.600> if<00:01:19.899> I

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
he is untested he decided that if I

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.680 
he is untested he decided that if I
can't<00:01:20.350> fix<00:01:20.649> it<00:01:20.830> and<00:01:21.100> he<00:01:22.030> didn't<00:01:22.270> want<00:01:22.420> to<00:01:22.479> mess

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
can't fix it and he didn't want to mess

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.600 
can't fix it and he didn't want to mess
with<00:01:22.720> it<00:01:22.990> so<00:01:23.290> I<00:01:23.350> kind<00:01:23.619> of<00:01:23.680> took<00:01:23.830> that<00:01:23.890> personal

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
with it so I kind of took that personal

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.219 
with it so I kind of took that personal
and<00:01:25.410> reverse<00:01:26.410> engineered<00:01:27.100> it<00:01:27.280> and<00:01:28.080> took<00:01:29.080> me

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
and reverse engineered it and took me

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.200 
and reverse engineered it and took me
maybe<00:01:29.470> a<00:01:29.590> day<00:01:29.860> to<00:01:29.920> reverse<00:01:30.340> engineered<00:01:30.970> and

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
maybe a day to reverse engineered and

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.450 
maybe a day to reverse engineered and
another<00:01:31.509> day<00:01:31.720> to<00:01:31.780> fix<00:01:32.080> it<00:01:32.320> wasn't<00:01:32.830> nothing

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.499 

overwhelming<00:01:36.460> about<00:01:36.759> it<00:01:36.970> the<00:01:37.119> only<00:01:37.330> two

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
overwhelming about it the only two

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.490 
overwhelming about it the only two
things<00:01:37.810> wrong<00:01:38.050> with<00:01:38.350> it<00:01:38.410> is<00:01:38.740> that<00:01:38.770> um<00:01:40.500> high-low

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
things wrong with it is that um high-low

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.430 
things wrong with it is that um high-low
switch<00:01:42.030> which<00:01:43.030> actually<00:01:43.509> grounds<00:01:44.080> either<00:01:44.200> the

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
switch which actually grounds either the

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.090 
switch which actually grounds either the
center<00:01:44.740> tab<00:01:45.119> or<00:01:46.119> the<00:01:46.180> bridge<00:01:46.810> for<00:01:47.650> the<00:01:47.770> screen

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
center tab or the bridge for the screen

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.429 
center tab or the bridge for the screen
voltage<00:01:48.580> was<00:01:48.760> bad<00:01:49.060> so<00:01:49.750> the<00:01:49.869> tubes<00:01:50.110> weren't

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 
voltage was bad so the tubes weren't

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:53.460 
voltage was bad so the tubes weren't
getting<00:01:50.770> the<00:01:50.979> screen<00:01:51.430> voltage<00:01:51.909> and<00:01:52.869> the

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
getting the screen voltage and the

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.130 
getting the screen voltage and the
little<00:01:53.770> neon<00:01:54.010> IRF<00:01:54.850> light<00:01:55.270> was<00:01:55.600> out<00:01:55.810> so

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
little neon IRF light was out so

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.880 
little neon IRF light was out so
replaced<00:01:57.100> both<00:01:57.460> the<00:01:58.170> high-low<00:01:59.170> switch<00:01:59.530> to

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
replaced both the high-low switch to

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.539 
replaced both the high-low switch to
load<00:02:00.070> neon<00:02:00.490> light<00:02:00.850> and<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:02.619> way<00:02:02.799> we<00:02:03.040> went<00:02:03.340> we

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
load neon light and a way we went we

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.030 
load neon light and a way we went we
also<00:02:03.729> reformed<00:02:04.570> the<00:02:04.840> capacitors<00:02:05.619> even<00:02:05.979> though

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
also reformed the capacitors even though

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.449 
also reformed the capacitors even though
they<00:02:06.220> probably<00:02:06.430> didn't<00:02:06.970> need<00:02:07.090> it<00:02:08.220> this<00:02:09.220> is<00:02:09.429> a

radio<00:02:45.660> we've<00:02:46.660> got<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:46.930> little<00:02:47.110> watt<00:02:47.470> meter

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
radio we've got the little watt meter

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.320 
radio we've got the little watt meter
there<00:02:48.130> on<00:02:48.690> SW<00:02:49.690> ours<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:50.200> automatic<00:02:51.330> SWR

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
there on SW ours the automatic SWR

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.240 
there on SW ours the automatic SWR
reading<00:02:52.750> watt<00:02:52.930> meter<00:02:53.200> so<00:02:53.410> we<00:02:53.560> like<00:02:53.770> that<00:02:53.980> for

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
reading watt meter so we like that for

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.570 
reading watt meter so we like that for
the<00:02:54.340> input<00:02:54.700> tuning<00:02:55.380> shows<00:02:56.380> us<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.770> SWR<00:02:57.430> of

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
the input tuning shows us the SWR of

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.830 
the input tuning shows us the SWR of
this<00:02:57.790> amp<00:02:58.180> then<00:02:58.840> we<00:02:58.990> got<00:02:59.170> the<00:03:00.150> MFJ<00:03:01.150> giant<00:03:01.660> watt

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
this amp then we got the MFJ giant watt

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.790 
this amp then we got the MFJ giant watt
meter<00:03:02.140> hooked<00:03:02.440> up<00:03:03.600> and<00:03:04.600> over<00:03:05.020> there's<00:03:05.290> a<00:03:05.500> big

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
meter hooked up and over there's a big

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.520 
meter hooked up and over there's a big
bad<00:03:06.040> dummy<00:03:06.490> load<00:03:07.320> that's<00:03:08.320> got<00:03:08.590> about<00:03:08.710> 10<00:03:10.530> 300

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
bad dummy load that's got about 10 300

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.930 
bad dummy load that's got about 10 300
watt<00:03:13.050> resistors<00:03:14.050> in<00:03:14.260> it<00:03:14.410> so<00:03:15.310> to<00:03:15.370> probably<00:03:15.760> do

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
watt resistors in it so to probably do

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.600 
watt resistors in it so to probably do
three<00:03:16.300> four<00:03:16.510> thousand<00:03:17.170> uh<00:03:17.350> Watts<00:03:18.040> all<00:03:18.310> day

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
three four thousand uh Watts all day

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.310 
three four thousand uh Watts all day
long<00:03:20.730> probably<00:03:21.730> do<00:03:21.940> about<00:03:22.240> five<00:03:22.540> ten<00:03:22.870> thousand

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
long probably do about five ten thousand

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.130 
long probably do about five ten thousand
Watts<00:03:23.500> peak<00:03:23.800> in<00:03:24.100> it<00:03:24.330> so<00:03:25.330> that<00:03:25.510> sucker<00:03:25.780> doesn't

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
Watts peak in it so that sucker doesn't

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.680 
Watts peak in it so that sucker doesn't
even<00:03:26.260> get<00:03:26.380> warm<00:03:26.910> because<00:03:27.910> I<00:03:28.060> don't<00:03:28.240> really<00:03:28.390> run

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690

oh<00:04:10.670> the<00:04:11.670> old<00:04:11.940> little<00:04:12.330> modulator<00:04:12.870> is<00:04:12.989> doing

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
oh the old little modulator is doing

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:19.819 
oh the old little modulator is doing
about<00:04:13.319> 20<00:04:13.769> average<00:04:15.200> audio<00:04:16.790> 25<00:04:17.790> maybe<00:04:18.290> and<00:04:19.290> on

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
about 20 average audio 25 maybe and on

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.800 
about 20 average audio 25 maybe and on
peak<00:04:21.979> audio<00:04:22.979> audio<00:04:23.669> the<00:04:23.970> little<00:04:24.210> modulator<00:04:24.720> is

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
peak audio audio the little modulator is

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.370 
peak audio audio the little modulator is
doing<00:04:24.990> about<00:04:25.080> 50<00:04:25.410> watts<00:04:25.770> P<00:04:26.070> okay<00:04:26.729> I<00:04:27.200> guess<00:04:28.200> it's

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
doing about 50 watts P okay I guess it's

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.550 
doing about 50 watts P okay I guess it's
Showtime<00:04:28.919> so<00:04:29.630> I'm<00:04:30.630> going<00:04:30.840> to<00:04:30.870> put<00:04:31.050> that<00:04:31.260> on<00:04:31.440> the
