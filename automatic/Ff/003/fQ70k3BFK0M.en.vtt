00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.279 

in<00:00:22.130> the<00:00:22.609> last<00:00:22.820> video<00:00:23.240> I<00:00:23.300> talked<00:00:23.750> about<00:00:23.960> the

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 
in the last video I talked about the

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.519 
in the last video I talked about the
basics<00:00:24.890> of<00:00:25.039> using<00:00:25.279> layers<00:00:25.789> and<00:00:26.240> I<00:00:27.080> wanted<00:00:27.470> to

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529 
basics of using layers and I wanted to

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:29.890 
basics of using layers and I wanted to
cover<00:00:28.430> how<00:00:28.730> you<00:00:28.759> can<00:00:28.910> actually<00:00:29.240> override

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
cover how you can actually override

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.929 
cover how you can actually override
those<00:00:30.320> layers<00:00:30.560> because<00:00:31.400> sometimes<00:00:31.759> that

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
those layers because sometimes that

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:33.520 
those layers because sometimes that
causes<00:00:32.119> confusion<00:00:32.509> it<00:00:32.960> can<00:00:33.050> be<00:00:33.140> really<00:00:33.320> handy

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
causes confusion it can be really handy

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.240 
causes confusion it can be really handy
but<00:00:34.280> you<00:00:34.970> know<00:00:35.059> sometimes<00:00:35.300> things<00:00:35.720> can<00:00:36.020> get<00:00:36.250> a

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
but you know sometimes things can get a

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.009 
but you know sometimes things can get a
little<00:00:37.519> bit<00:00:37.879> confused<00:00:38.330> if<00:00:38.449> you're<00:00:38.600> not<00:00:38.720> aware

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:39.019 
little bit confused if you're not aware

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:42.299 
little bit confused if you're not aware
of<00:00:39.199> that<00:00:39.379> so<00:00:40.339> as<00:00:41.330> I<00:00:41.510> mentioned<00:00:41.870> last<00:00:41.900> time

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 
of that so as I mentioned last time

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:45.340 
of that so as I mentioned last time
anything<00:00:43.309> you<00:00:43.339> put<00:00:43.760> on<00:00:44.030> a<00:00:44.089> layer<00:00:44.480> you<00:00:44.809> know<00:00:45.230> if

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
anything you put on a layer you know if

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.140 
anything you put on a layer you know if
I<00:00:45.410> pick<00:00:45.620> these<00:00:45.830> lines<00:00:46.129> for<00:00:46.430> example<00:00:46.519> and

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.150 
I pick these lines for example and

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.810 
I pick these lines for example and
change<00:00:47.750> them<00:00:47.960> to<00:00:48.199> my<00:00:48.470> walls<00:00:48.829> layer<00:00:49.339> that's

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
change them to my walls layer that's

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.869 
change them to my walls layer that's
read<00:00:50.089> will<00:00:50.720> have<00:00:50.989> the<00:00:51.290> property<00:00:51.890> of<00:00:52.040> that

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
read will have the property of that

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:54.430 
read will have the property of that
given<00:00:53.329> layer<00:00:53.570> okay

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
given layer okay

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.889 
given layer okay
so<00:00:54.739> we'll<00:00:54.890> have<00:00:55.100> the<00:00:55.370> color<00:00:55.730> the<00:00:56.270> line<00:00:56.539> type

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
so we'll have the color the line type

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.099 
so we'll have the color the line type
and<00:00:57.170> so<00:00:57.829> on<00:00:58.039> but<00:00:58.820> you<00:00:59.000> can<00:00:59.180> actually<00:00:59.420> go<00:00:59.809> into

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
and so on but you can actually go into

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:02.799 
and so on but you can actually go into
the<00:01:00.590> properties<00:01:01.219> of<00:01:01.250> any<00:01:01.670> given<00:01:02.120> object<00:01:02.300> and

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
the properties of any given object and

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.400 
the properties of any given object and
override<00:01:03.440> that<00:01:03.739> so<00:01:04.640> these<00:01:05.420> lines<00:01:05.899> here<00:01:06.200> for

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.410 
override that so these lines here for

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.480 
override that so these lines here for
example<00:01:06.680> are<00:01:07.039> on<00:01:07.280> the<00:01:07.850> walls<00:01:08.149> layer<00:01:08.780> ok<00:01:09.740> and<00:01:10.009> I

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
example are on the walls layer ok and I

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.940 
example are on the walls layer ok and I
can<00:01:10.670> see<00:01:10.820> information<00:01:11.000> about<00:01:11.660> that<00:01:11.899> up<00:01:12.500> above

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
can see information about that up above

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.469 
can see information about that up above
I<00:01:13.220> can<00:01:13.399> see<00:01:13.550> that<00:01:13.700> it's<00:01:13.789> on<00:01:13.880> the<00:01:14.030> walls<00:01:14.210> layer

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
I can see that it's on the walls layer

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:16.150 
I can see that it's on the walls layer
and<00:01:14.780> then<00:01:15.289> here<00:01:15.530> we<00:01:15.619> have<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:15.920> quick

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
and then here we have the quick

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.279 
and then here we have the quick
properties<00:01:16.759> and<00:01:17.119> to<00:01:17.690> the<00:01:17.780> left<00:01:17.960> I<00:01:18.050> have<00:01:18.200> the

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.289 
properties and to the left I have the

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:20.350 
properties and to the left I have the
full<00:01:18.500> properties<00:01:19.039> palette<00:01:19.310> so<00:01:19.789> either<00:01:20.149> way

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
full properties palette so either way

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.980 
full properties palette so either way
we're<00:01:20.509> gonna<00:01:20.570> see<00:01:20.899> this<00:01:21.020> information<00:01:21.229> if<00:01:22.810> I<00:01:23.810> go

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
we're gonna see this information if I go

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.240 
we're gonna see this information if I go
to<00:01:24.050> the<00:01:24.170> properties<00:01:24.649> palette<00:01:24.920> that's<00:01:25.220> a

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
to the properties palette that's a

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.219 
to the properties palette that's a
little<00:01:25.369> bit<00:01:25.490> more<00:01:25.550> expanded<00:01:26.000> you'll<00:01:26.780> see<00:01:27.050> that

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
little bit more expanded you'll see that

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.499 
little bit more expanded you'll see that
here<00:01:27.649> it<00:01:27.770> says<00:01:28.039> by<00:01:28.340> layer<00:01:28.700> so<00:01:29.000> the<00:01:29.119> color<00:01:29.330> of

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:29.509 
here it says by layer so the color of

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.109 
here it says by layer so the color of
those<00:01:29.690> lines<00:01:30.050> is<00:01:30.440> red<00:01:30.950> because<00:01:31.640> it's

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
those lines is red because it's

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.080 
those lines is red because it's
determined<00:01:32.630> by<00:01:32.750> the<00:01:32.810> layer<00:01:33.220> but<00:01:34.220> I<00:01:34.399> can<00:01:34.759> come

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
determined by the layer but I can come

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.510 
determined by the layer but I can come
in<00:01:35.270> and<00:01:35.450> change<00:01:35.990> the<00:01:36.349> color<00:01:36.649> of<00:01:36.800> these<00:01:37.130> lines

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
in and change the color of these lines

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.650 
in and change the color of these lines
to<00:01:37.910> any<00:01:38.119> color<00:01:38.750> I<00:01:38.869> want<00:01:39.319> I<00:01:39.679> can<00:01:40.580> also<00:01:40.759> go<00:01:41.090> in<00:01:41.300> and

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
to any color I want I can also go in and

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.580 
to any color I want I can also go in and
change<00:01:41.959> this<00:01:42.259> to<00:01:42.590> any<00:01:42.890> line<00:01:43.280> weight<00:01:44.560> that<00:01:45.560> I

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
change this to any line weight that I

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.010 
change this to any line weight that I
want<00:01:46.009> and<00:01:46.340> that's<00:01:47.149> how<00:01:47.300> you<00:01:47.360> can<00:01:47.539> very<00:01:47.660> simply

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
want and that's how you can very simply

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.320 
want and that's how you can very simply
override<00:01:48.739> a<00:01:48.770> layer<00:01:49.130> now<00:01:50.030> you<00:01:50.090> might<00:01:50.300> be

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
override a layer now you might be

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.089 
override a layer now you might be
thinking<00:01:50.450> you<00:01:51.170> just<00:01:51.500> changed<00:01:51.800> the<00:01:51.860> line

00:01:52.089 --> 00:01:52.099 
thinking you just changed the line

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:54.130 
thinking you just changed the line
weight<00:01:52.340> but<00:01:53.119> it<00:01:53.239> looks<00:01:53.450> exactly<00:01:53.660> the<00:01:54.020> same

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
weight but it looks exactly the same

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.080 
weight but it looks exactly the same
that's<00:01:55.039> another<00:01:55.250> important<00:01:55.729> thing<00:01:55.759> to<00:01:55.910> be

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
that's another important thing to be

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.460 
that's another important thing to be
aware<00:01:56.119> of<00:01:56.390> down<00:01:56.810> at<00:01:56.929> the<00:01:57.020> bottom<00:01:57.170> of<00:01:57.440> your

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
aware of down at the bottom of your

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.400 
aware of down at the bottom of your
screen<00:01:58.390> you<00:01:59.390> have<00:01:59.630> a<00:01:59.690> lot<00:01:59.989> of<00:02:00.020> different

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
screen you have a lot of different

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.469 
screen you have a lot of different
options<00:02:00.530> where<00:02:00.830> we<00:02:00.860> find<00:02:01.160> ortho<00:02:01.759> and<00:02:01.789> objects

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
options where we find ortho and objects

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.389 
options where we find ortho and objects
NAB<00:02:02.630> and<00:02:02.810> all<00:02:02.929> that<00:02:03.110> kind<00:02:03.349> of<00:02:03.410> stuff<00:02:03.530> you<00:02:04.250> can

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
NAB and all that kind of stuff you can

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.389 
NAB and all that kind of stuff you can
also<00:02:04.670> show<00:02:05.360> and<00:02:05.690> hide<00:02:05.989> line<00:02:06.590> weight<00:02:06.890> with<00:02:07.250> this

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
also show and hide line weight with this

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.600 
also show and hide line weight with this
button<00:02:07.670> right<00:02:07.759> here<00:02:08.440> so<00:02:09.440> if<00:02:09.739> I<00:02:09.860> click<00:02:10.160> that<00:02:10.310> on

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
button right here so if I click that on

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.360 
button right here so if I click that on
so<00:02:10.940> it's<00:02:11.060> blue<00:02:11.360> and<00:02:11.810> now<00:02:12.110> I<00:02:12.170> can<00:02:12.410> actually<00:02:12.950> see

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
so it's blue and now I can actually see

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.400 
so it's blue and now I can actually see
the<00:02:13.610> line<00:02:13.819> weight<00:02:14.060> that<00:02:14.239> I<00:02:14.270> change<00:02:14.750> it's

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
the line weight that I change it's

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.440 
the line weight that I change it's
important<00:02:16.040> that<00:02:16.220> you<00:02:16.340> know<00:02:16.610> that<00:02:16.640> because<00:02:17.330> if

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
important that you know that because if

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.970 
important that you know that because if
you<00:02:17.540> go<00:02:17.629> to<00:02:17.690> print<00:02:18.050> and<00:02:18.260> you've<00:02:18.349> changed<00:02:18.650> line

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
you go to print and you've changed line

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.559 
you go to print and you've changed line
way<00:02:19.220> but<00:02:19.459> you<00:02:19.550> can't<00:02:19.760> see<00:02:19.910> on<00:02:19.940> your<00:02:20.120> screen<00:02:20.420> it

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
will print out so you might print out

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.619 
will print out so you might print out
something<00:02:22.879> that<00:02:23.060> looked<00:02:23.209> like<00:02:23.270> it<00:02:23.360> was<00:02:23.480> drawn

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629 
something that looked like it was drawn

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.210 
can you know go to the quick properties
at<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:40.880> top<00:02:41.090> and<00:02:41.420> you<00:02:41.870> can<00:02:41.900> override<00:02:42.710> those

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
at the top and you can override those

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.250 
at the top and you can override those
layer<00:02:43.490> settings<00:02:43.940> by<00:02:44.480> just<00:02:44.780> changing<00:02:45.020> the

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
layer settings by just changing the

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.260 
layer settings by just changing the
color<00:02:45.880> by<00:02:46.880> changing<00:02:47.660> the<00:02:47.780> line<00:02:48.080> weight<00:02:48.410> and

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
color by changing the line weight and

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.380 
color by changing the line weight and
you<00:02:50.270> can<00:02:50.300> even<00:02:50.540> change<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:51.020> line<00:02:51.320> type<00:02:51.860> and<00:02:52.390> so

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
you can even change the line type and so

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.870 
you can even change the line type and so
on<00:02:53.420> so<00:02:54.230> don't<00:02:54.680> be<00:02:54.860> fooled<00:02:55.130> especially<00:02:55.820> if

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
on so don't be fooled especially if

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.250 
on so don't be fooled especially if
you're<00:02:56.000> working<00:02:56.360> on<00:02:56.510> you<00:02:56.840> know<00:02:56.900> a<00:02:56.959> group

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
you're working on you know a group

you're working on you know a group
document<00:02:57.830> where<00:02:57.980> you<00:02:58.010> know<00:02:58.310> what<00:02:58.459> many<00:02:58.670> team

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
members are working that just because

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.040 
members are working that just because
you<00:03:01.070> know<00:03:01.190> certain<00:03:01.610> items<00:03:02.030> have<00:03:02.750> the<00:03:02.870> same

you know certain items have the same
color<00:03:03.380> for<00:03:03.709> example<00:03:03.770> does<00:03:04.310> not<00:03:04.459> necessarily

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
color for example does not necessarily

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.630 
color for example does not necessarily
mean<00:03:05.780> they're<00:03:05.959> on<00:03:06.050> the<00:03:06.170> same<00:03:06.350> layer<00:03:06.680> this<00:03:07.459> will

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
mean they're on the same layer this will

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.240 
mean they're on the same layer this will
hold<00:03:07.760> true<00:03:07.940> for<00:03:08.000> any<00:03:08.420> you<00:03:08.989> know<00:03:09.110> any<00:03:09.250> geometry

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
hold true for any you know any geometry

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.670 
hold true for any you know any geometry
that<00:03:10.640> you're<00:03:10.850> drawing<00:03:11.060> any<00:03:11.510> annotations<00:03:12.020> you

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
that you're drawing any annotations you

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.330 
that you're drawing any annotations you
know<00:03:12.770> any<00:03:12.980> of<00:03:13.190> that<00:03:13.690> you<00:03:14.690> can<00:03:14.900> either<00:03:15.230> work<00:03:15.830> by

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
know any of that you can either work by

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.630 
know any of that you can either work by
the<00:03:16.400> layer<00:03:16.850> or<00:03:17.300> you<00:03:18.230> can<00:03:18.380> override<00:03:18.830> that<00:03:19.250> and

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
the layer or you can override that and

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.570 
the layer or you can override that and
it's<00:03:20.239> very<00:03:20.600> easy<00:03:20.870> to<00:03:20.989> confuse<00:03:21.290> by<00:03:21.650> that<00:03:21.830> so<00:03:22.520> I

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
it's very easy to confuse by that so I

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.460 
it's very easy to confuse by that so I
just<00:03:22.610> wanted<00:03:22.970> to<00:03:23.030> make<00:03:23.120> sure<00:03:23.150> you<00:03:23.420> know<00:03:23.540> also

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
just wanted to make sure you know also

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.650 
just wanted to make sure you know also
don't<00:03:24.680> forget<00:03:24.980> that<00:03:25.340> you<00:03:25.820> can<00:03:25.970> toggle<00:03:26.239> line

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
don't forget that you can toggle line

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.320 
don't forget that you can toggle line
weight<00:03:26.900> on<00:03:27.110> and<00:03:27.590> off<00:03:27.709> and<00:03:28.130> the<00:03:29.000> reason<00:03:29.270> you

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
weight on and off and the reason you

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.120 
weight on and off and the reason you
would<00:03:29.450> do<00:03:29.660> that<00:03:29.900> is<00:03:30.200> because<00:03:30.739> it's<00:03:30.920> going<00:03:31.040> to

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
would do that is because it's going to

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.420 
would do that is because it's going to
be<00:03:31.420> much<00:03:32.420> easier<00:03:32.570> to<00:03:33.140> draft<00:03:33.500> with<00:03:33.980> the<00:03:34.100> default

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
be much easier to draft with the default

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.400 
be much easier to draft with the default
line<00:03:34.670> weight<00:03:34.940> but<00:03:35.450> once<00:03:35.600> you're<00:03:35.780> all<00:03:35.900> done<00:03:36.170> you

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
line weight but once you're all done you

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.050 
line weight but once you're all done you
might<00:03:36.560> want<00:03:36.980> some<00:03:37.190> lines<00:03:37.370> thicker<00:03:37.670> some

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
might want some lines thicker some

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.160 
might want some lines thicker some
thinner<00:03:38.300> for<00:03:38.950> you<00:03:39.950> know<00:03:40.010> contrast<00:03:40.640> and<00:03:41.170> making

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
thinner for you know contrast and making

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.030 
thinner for you know contrast and making
your<00:03:42.380> drawing<00:03:43.010> a<00:03:43.190> little<00:03:43.280> bit<00:03:43.430> more<00:03:43.580> legible
