00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
well here we are the final countertop

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.220 
well here we are the final countertop
piece<00:00:27.980> has<00:00:28.250> been<00:00:28.490> made<00:00:28.760> this<00:00:29.660> was<00:00:29.930> probably

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
piece has been made this was probably

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.230 
piece has been made this was probably
the<00:00:30.380> most<00:00:30.470> challenging<00:00:31.310> piece<00:00:31.520> since<00:00:31.880> I<00:00:32.029> had

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:32.240 
the most challenging piece since I had

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.100 
the most challenging piece since I had
to<00:00:32.420> do<00:00:32.570> an<00:00:32.840> inlay<00:00:33.020> here<00:00:33.550> for<00:00:34.550> the<00:00:34.730> sink<00:00:35.110> but

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
to do an inlay here for the sink but

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.560 
to do an inlay here for the sink but
we're<00:00:36.920> pretty<00:00:37.160> much<00:00:37.340> all<00:00:37.580> set<00:00:37.850> and<00:00:38.060> done<00:00:38.270> with

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
we're pretty much all set and done with

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.170 
we're pretty much all set and done with
the<00:00:38.840> countertops<00:00:39.560> now<00:00:39.860> I<00:00:39.890> I<00:00:40.310> do<00:00:40.580> have<00:00:40.820> to<00:00:40.940> set

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
the countertops now I I do have to set

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.810 
the countertops now I I do have to set
these<00:00:41.360> in<00:00:41.630> place<00:00:41.900> they're<00:00:42.200> not<00:00:42.400> mounted<00:00:43.400> as<00:00:43.580> of

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820

fits nice I've got a little bit of a
shim<00:00:49.400> here<00:00:49.670> that<00:00:49.880> I'm<00:00:49.970> going<00:00:50.120> to<00:00:50.210> have<00:00:50.420> to<00:00:50.600> use

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
shim here that I'm going to have to use

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.380 
shim here that I'm going to have to use
to<00:00:51.200> level<00:00:52.160> up<00:00:52.309> the<00:00:52.489> seams<00:00:52.790> but<00:00:53.150> otherwise

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
to level up the seams but otherwise

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.590 
to level up the seams but otherwise
everything's<00:00:54.080> looking<00:00:54.260> great<00:00:54.650> and<00:00:55.600> well

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600

everything's looking great and well
today<00:00:56.930> what<00:00:57.140> I<00:00:57.170> hope<00:00:57.410> to<00:00:57.559> do<00:00:57.710> is<00:00:57.949> they<00:00:58.100> actually

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
today what I hope to do is they actually

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.150 
today what I hope to do is they actually
make<00:00:58.730> some<00:00:59.000> back<00:00:59.210> splashes<00:00:59.629> so<00:01:00.620> I'll<00:01:00.739> go<00:01:00.949> in<00:01:01.070> a

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
make some back splashes so I'll go in a

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:14.770 
make some back splashes so I'll go in a
little<00:01:01.280> bit<00:01:01.400> of<00:01:01.610> detail<00:01:02.000> of<00:01:02.239> how<00:01:02.390> that's<00:01:02.629> done

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.630 

now<00:01:15.500> that<00:01:15.710> was<00:01:15.830> a<00:01:15.860> good<00:01:16.130> nap<00:01:16.310> oh<00:01:16.870> hi<00:01:18.520> what<00:01:19.520> we

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
now that was a good nap oh hi what we

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.710 
now that was a good nap oh hi what we
have<00:01:19.820> here<00:01:20.000> in<00:01:20.120> front<00:01:20.300> of<00:01:20.660> me<00:01:20.930> is<00:01:22.030> the<00:01:23.030> molding

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
have here in front of me is the molding

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.460 
have here in front of me is the molding
which<00:01:24.380> I've<00:01:24.590> used<00:01:24.950> to<00:01:25.250> make<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:26.540> backsplash

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
which I've used to make the backsplash

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.030 
which I've used to make the backsplash
form<00:01:28.250> I've<00:01:29.120> used<00:01:29.510> strips<00:01:30.020> of<00:01:30.230> vinyl<00:01:30.770> that<00:01:30.800> I've

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
form I've used strips of vinyl that I've

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.340 
form I've used strips of vinyl that I've
cut<00:01:31.340> into<00:01:31.700> various<00:01:32.180> links<00:01:32.540> and<00:01:32.840> shapes<00:01:33.110> and

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
cut into various links and shapes and

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.860 
cut into various links and shapes and
sizes<00:01:33.560> it<00:01:34.550> requires<00:01:35.000> more<00:01:35.270> screw<00:01:35.630> holes

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
sizes it requires more screw holes

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:37.090 
sizes it requires more screw holes
because<00:01:36.170> you<00:01:36.260> want<00:01:36.440> to<00:01:36.500> keep<00:01:36.650> it<00:01:36.860> perfectly

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.100 
because you want to keep it perfectly

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.150 
because you want to keep it perfectly
straight<00:01:37.820> but<00:01:38.410> we're<00:01:39.410> pretty<00:01:39.590> much<00:01:39.800> ready<00:01:40.010> to

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.160 
straight but we're pretty much ready to

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.480 
straight but we're pretty much ready to
pour<00:01:40.580> the<00:01:40.970> back<00:01:41.720> splashes<00:01:42.340> in<00:01:43.340> this

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
pour the back splashes in this

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.910 
pour the back splashes in this
particular<00:01:44.060> instance<00:01:44.450> I'm<00:01:44.900> making<00:01:45.290> them<00:01:45.470> four

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
particular instance I'm making them four

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.590 
particular instance I'm making them four
and<00:01:46.100> a<00:01:46.160> quarter<00:01:46.520> inches<00:01:46.880> high<00:01:47.150> this<00:01:47.210> is

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
and a quarter inches high this is

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.620 
and a quarter inches high this is
because<00:01:48.080> it'll<00:01:48.350> match<00:01:48.590> the<00:01:48.620> backsplash<00:01:49.630> for

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
because it'll match the backsplash for

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.730 
because it'll match the backsplash for
the<00:01:51.550> breakfast<00:01:52.550> bar<00:01:52.729> area<00:01:53.210> and<00:01:53.710> there<00:01:54.710> are

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
the breakfast bar area and there are

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.490 
the breakfast bar area and there are
three<00:01:55.040> quarters<00:01:55.280> of<00:01:55.460> an<00:01:55.580> inch<00:01:55.700> thick<00:01:56.030> and<00:01:56.500> of

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
three quarters of an inch thick and of

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.930 
three quarters of an inch thick and of
course<00:01:57.680> the<00:01:57.830> links<00:01:58.010> vary<00:01:58.340> based<00:01:58.640> on<00:01:58.880> where

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
course the links vary based on where

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.330 
course the links vary based on where
they're<00:01:59.270> going<00:01:59.540> to<00:01:59.600> go<00:01:59.870> of<00:02:00.800> course<00:02:00.979> this<00:02:01.160> is

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
they're going to go of course this is

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.430 
they're going to go of course this is
all<00:02:01.520> another<00:02:01.850> one<00:02:02.120> of<00:02:02.240> those<00:02:02.360> big<00:02:02.660> experiments

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
all another one of those big experiments

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.500 
all another one of those big experiments
I'm<00:02:03.860> using<00:02:04.130> the<00:02:04.370> same<00:02:04.610> cement<00:02:05.030> that<00:02:05.210> I've<00:02:05.330> used

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
I'm using the same cement that I've used

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.600 
I'm using the same cement that I've used
in<00:02:05.720> the<00:02:05.810> countertops<00:02:06.350> along<00:02:06.830> with<00:02:07.070> recycled

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
in the countertops along with recycled

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.070 
in the countertops along with recycled
glass<00:02:07.899> they<00:02:08.899> also<00:02:09.080> contain<00:02:10.040> PVA<00:02:10.580> fibers<00:02:11.300> which

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
glass they also contain PVA fibers which

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.810 
glass they also contain PVA fibers which
will<00:02:12.320> help<00:02:12.560> strengthen<00:02:12.890> it<00:02:13.250> and<00:02:13.490> hopefully

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
will help strengthen it and hopefully

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.590 
will help strengthen it and hopefully
this<00:02:14.780> will<00:02:15.080> be<00:02:15.590> nice<00:02:15.860> and<00:02:16.130> firm<00:02:16.400> even<00:02:17.330> without

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
this will be nice and firm even without

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.440 
this will be nice and firm even without
any<00:02:17.810> other<00:02:18.050> kind<00:02:18.380> of<00:02:18.500> reinforcement<00:02:19.209> they<00:02:20.209> say

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
any other kind of reinforcement they say

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.210 
any other kind of reinforcement they say
that<00:02:20.690> with<00:02:20.810> PVA<00:02:21.200> fibers<00:02:21.739> you<00:02:21.920> can<00:02:22.070> actually

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
that with PVA fibers you can actually

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.550 
that with PVA fibers you can actually
pour<00:02:22.670> a<00:02:22.700> counter<00:02:23.090> top<00:02:23.270> 3/4<00:02:24.050> of<00:02:24.080> an<00:02:24.290> inch<00:02:24.410> thick

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
pour a counter top 3/4 of an inch thick

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.670 
pour a counter top 3/4 of an inch thick
I've<00:02:25.459> never<00:02:25.730> made<00:02:25.940> them<00:02:26.060> that<00:02:26.269> thin<00:02:26.600> but<00:02:27.470> this

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
I've never made them that thin but this

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.340 
I've never made them that thin but this
will<00:02:27.860> be<00:02:27.980> a<00:02:28.010> test<00:02:28.360> so<00:02:29.360> stay<00:02:29.660> tuned<00:02:29.930> until<00:02:30.050> next

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
will be a test so stay tuned until next

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.830 
will be a test so stay tuned until next
week<00:02:30.650> when<00:02:31.489> we'll<00:02:31.610> find<00:02:31.850> out<00:02:32.120> how<00:02:32.390> well<00:02:32.630> this

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
week when we'll find out how well this
