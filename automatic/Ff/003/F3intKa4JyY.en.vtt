00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
immediately now what I'm working to do

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.200 
immediately now what I'm working to do
here<00:00:27.900> is<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.529> see<00:00:28.769> if<00:00:29.010> we<00:00:29.220> can<00:00:29.429> find<00:00:29.699> where<00:00:30.029> her

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
here is to see if we can find where her

boundaries are

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.220 
boundaries are
I<00:00:31.170> mean<00:00:32.130> is<00:00:32.340> she<00:00:32.600> consistent<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.780> where<00:00:33.989> she

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
I mean is she consistent and where she

allows you to touch her or not so far

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.040 
allows you to touch her or not so far
with<00:00:37.770> when<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.129> was<00:00:38.280> working<00:00:38.760> with<00:00:38.879> her<00:00:39.090> just<00:00:39.840> in

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
with when I was working with her just in

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.220 
with when I was working with her just in
the<00:00:40.170> house<00:00:40.379> she<00:00:41.309> consistently<00:00:41.809> let<00:00:42.809> me<00:00:42.989> touch

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
the house she consistently let me touch

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.400 
the house she consistently let me touch
her<00:00:43.440> anywhere<00:00:43.890> on<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.520> head<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.000> neck<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.899> I

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
her anywhere on the head and neck and I

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.709 
her anywhere on the head and neck and I
didn't<00:00:46.680> go<00:00:46.770> any<00:00:46.920> further<00:00:46.980> back<00:00:47.399> because<00:00:48.360> I've

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
didn't go any further back because I've

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.569 
didn't go any further back because I've
seen<00:00:48.930> consistently<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:49.920> she<00:00:50.100> doesn't<00:00:50.309> let

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
seen consistently that she doesn't let

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.170 
seen consistently that she doesn't let
you<00:00:50.730> any<00:00:51.390> further<00:00:51.600> back<00:00:52.760> what<00:00:53.760> we're<00:00:53.910> going<00:00:54.090> to

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
you any further back what we're going to

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:05.119 
you any further back what we're going to
do<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.449> wrap<00:00:54.719> her<00:00:54.899> in<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:55.050> towel<00:00:59.329> okay<00:01:04.129> now

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
do is wrap her in a towel okay now

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.080 
do is wrap her in a towel okay now
what's<00:01:05.430> important<00:01:06.090> here<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:07.700> her<00:01:08.700> paws

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
what's important here is that her paws

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.460 
what's important here is that her paws
are<00:01:09.600> on<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.930> ground

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
are on the ground

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.580 
are on the ground
I<00:01:10.500> never<00:01:11.070> wrap<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.520> cat<00:01:11.820> up<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.270> think<00:01:12.990> it's<00:01:13.140> very

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
I never wrap a cat up I think it's very

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.280 
I never wrap a cat up I think it's very
unfair<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.460> them<00:01:14.580> because<00:01:15.479> they've<00:01:15.720> got<00:01:16.049> to

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
unfair to them because they've got to

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.440 
unfair to them because they've got to
have<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.770> sense<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.520> they're<00:01:17.850> in<00:01:18.030> control

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
have the sense that they're in control

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.070 
have the sense that they're in control
by<00:01:18.600> having<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:18.990> feet<00:01:19.170> on<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.380> ground<00:01:21.080> and

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
by having the feet on the ground and

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.910 
by having the feet on the ground and
I've<00:01:23.040> got<00:01:23.400> her<00:01:23.670> here<00:01:24.000> quite<00:01:24.570> firmly<00:01:24.990> but<00:01:25.740> not

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
I've got her here quite firmly but not

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.310 
I've got her here quite firmly but not
so<00:01:26.189> she<00:01:26.250> feels<00:01:26.549> like<00:01:26.729> she's<00:01:27.119> choked<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:28.200> know

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
so she feels like she's choked you know

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:36.760 
so she feels like she's choked you know
I<00:01:28.350> mean<00:01:28.560> there's<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.829> fine<00:01:29.100> line<00:01:29.130> there<00:01:30.560> good

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.359 

now<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.829> see<00:01:38.250> suddenly<00:01:39.619> she<00:01:40.619> can<00:01:40.799> accept<00:01:41.130> this

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
now you see suddenly she can accept this

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.090 
now you see suddenly she can accept this
in<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.030> towel<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.770> reason<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:44.040> I

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
in the towel and the reason that I

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.920 
in the towel and the reason that I
didn't<00:01:44.759> put<00:01:44.880> her<00:01:44.970> in<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.149> towel<00:01:45.329> immediately

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
didn't put her in the towel immediately

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.889 
didn't put her in the towel immediately
I<00:01:45.960> really<00:01:46.500> want<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.950> see<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.220> difference

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
I really want you to see the difference

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:49.999 
I really want you to see the difference
because<00:01:48.899> sometimes<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.439> think<00:01:49.470> oh<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.860> was

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
because sometimes you think oh it was

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.319 
because sometimes you think oh it was
just<00:01:50.220> because<00:01:50.490> she's<00:01:50.640> up<00:01:50.790> here's<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.090> little

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
just because she's up here's a little

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.880 
just because she's up here's a little
nervous<00:01:51.689> when<00:01:51.869> she<00:01:52.049> was<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.350> way<00:01:52.500> but<00:01:52.710> it's

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
nervous when she was that way but it's

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.550 
nervous when she was that way but it's
not<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.930> the<00:01:54.930> thing<00:01:55.140> that's<00:01:55.320> nice<00:01:55.500> about

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
not is it the thing that's nice about

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.789
