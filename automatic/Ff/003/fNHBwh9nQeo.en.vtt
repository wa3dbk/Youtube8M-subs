00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.490 
from the target when I come up to cover
one<00:02:11.150> of<00:02:11.180> the<00:02:11.330> things<00:02:11.540> I<00:02:11.690> want<00:02:11.960> to<00:02:12.020> do<00:02:12.170> is<00:02:12.320> keep

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
one of the things I want to do is keep

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
one of the things I want to do is keep
some<00:02:13.220> distance<00:02:13.490> between<00:02:13.910> me<00:02:14.270> and<00:02:14.420> cover<00:02:14.660> so<00:02:15.560> in

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
some distance between me and cover so in

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.300 
some distance between me and cover so in
a<00:02:16.700> competition<00:02:17.300> type<00:02:17.780> situation<00:02:18.500> in<00:02:18.590> IDPA<00:02:19.040> or

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
a competition type situation in IDPA or

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.450 
a competition type situation in IDPA or
so

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
so

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:20.620 
so
something<00:02:19.670> like<00:02:19.820> that<00:02:19.850> you'll<00:02:20.180> notice<00:02:20.390> many

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
something like that you'll notice many

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.390 
something like that you'll notice many
competitors<00:02:21.320> come<00:02:21.620> up<00:02:21.830> and<00:02:22.040> they'll<00:02:22.190> just

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
competitors come up and they'll just

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.120 
competitors come up and they'll just
kind<00:02:22.580> of<00:02:22.730> reach<00:02:23.240> out<00:02:23.480> index<00:02:24.050> the<00:02:24.350> distance<00:02:24.950> of

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
kind of reach out index the distance of

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.430 
kind of reach out index the distance of
the<00:02:25.250> cover<00:02:25.580> that<00:02:26.210> they're<00:02:26.480> shooting<00:02:26.930> from<00:02:27.170> so

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
the cover that they're shooting from so

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.440 
the cover that they're shooting from so
they<00:02:27.560> don't<00:02:27.740> get<00:02:27.890> too<00:02:28.160> close<00:02:28.400> let<00:02:29.090> me<00:02:29.180> show<00:02:29.360> you

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
they don't get too close let me show you

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.020 
they don't get too close let me show you
why<00:02:29.840> you<00:02:30.200> don't<00:02:30.530> want<00:02:30.770> to<00:02:30.890> get<00:02:30.980> too<00:02:31.220> close<00:02:31.400> I'm

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
why you don't want to get too close I'm

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.330 
why you don't want to get too close I'm
gonna<00:02:32.210> get<00:02:32.360> the<00:02:33.080> cameras<00:02:33.650> on<00:02:33.800> the<00:02:33.890> other<00:02:34.040> side

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
gonna get the cameras on the other side

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.220 
gonna get the cameras on the other side
here<00:02:34.730> and<00:02:34.910> I'm<00:02:35.090> going<00:02:35.240> to<00:02:35.270> show<00:02:35.510> you<00:02:35.570> two

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
here and I'm going to show you two

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.030 
here and I'm going to show you two
different<00:02:36.770> views<00:02:37.160> if<00:02:38.030> the<00:02:38.450> cover<00:02:38.780> is<00:02:39.110> closed

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
different views if the cover is closed

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.940 
different views if the cover is closed
or<00:02:40.550> I'm<00:02:40.760> close<00:02:41.060> to<00:02:41.090> it<00:02:41.420> versus<00:02:42.170> the<00:02:42.410> cover<00:02:42.680> is

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
or I'm close to it versus the cover is

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.760 
or I'm close to it versus the cover is
some<00:02:43.340> distance<00:02:44.030> about<00:02:44.660> again<00:02:45.110> an<00:02:45.350> arm's

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
some distance about again an arm's

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.890 
some distance about again an arm's
length<00:02:45.860> away<00:02:46.310> from<00:02:46.760> my<00:02:46.880> body<00:02:47.120> let's<00:02:47.720> take<00:02:47.870> a

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
length away from my body let's take a

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.410 
length away from my body let's take a
look<00:02:48.140> at<00:02:48.260> that<00:02:48.410> right<00:02:48.740> now<00:02:48.770> alright<00:02:49.700> so<00:02:50.060> in<00:02:50.300> the

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
look at that right now alright so in the

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.200 
look at that right now alright so in the
ideal<00:02:50.810> world<00:02:51.140> if<00:02:51.440> I<00:02:51.590> have<00:02:51.830> cover<00:02:52.160> here<00:02:52.550> what

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
ideal world if I have cover here what

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.060 
ideal world if I have cover here what
I'm<00:02:53.360> gonna<00:02:53.540> do<00:02:53.810> is<00:02:54.020> I'm<00:02:54.170> gonna<00:02:54.290> approach<00:02:54.770> the

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna approach the

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.160 
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna approach the
cover<00:02:55.340> and<00:02:55.760> again<00:02:56.120> keep<00:02:56.390> that<00:02:56.420> arm's<00:02:57.050> length

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
cover and again keep that arm's length

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.410 
cover and again keep that arm's length
distance<00:02:57.680> from<00:02:58.610> the<00:02:59.000> actual<00:02:59.390> blockade<00:03:00.080> itself

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
distance from the actual blockade itself

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.320 
distance from the actual blockade itself
that's<00:03:02.420> because<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:03.830> farther<00:03:04.250> I<00:03:04.340> am<00:03:04.820> away

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
that's because the farther I am away

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.990 
that's because the farther I am away
from<00:03:05.360> it<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:06.260> less<00:03:06.530> of<00:03:06.740> my<00:03:06.890> body<00:03:07.220> I<00:03:07.430> have<00:03:07.850> to

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
from it the less of my body I have to

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.540 
from it the less of my body I have to
expose<00:03:08.390> out<00:03:08.690> around<00:03:09.260> the<00:03:09.500> cover<00:03:09.770> to<00:03:10.100> engage

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
expose out around the cover to engage

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.300 
expose out around the cover to engage
the<00:03:11.270> target<00:03:11.840> from<00:03:12.020> either<00:03:12.320> side<00:03:12.710> so<00:03:13.160> if<00:03:14.120> I<00:03:14.420> can

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
the target from either side so if I can

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.250 
the target from either side so if I can
come<00:03:16.310> around<00:03:16.610> you'll<00:03:17.030> see<00:03:17.090> that<00:03:17.270> yeah<00:03:18.050> I'm

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
come around you'll see that yeah I'm

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.830 
come around you'll see that yeah I'm
about<00:03:18.380> an<00:03:18.680> arm's<00:03:18.980> length<00:03:19.070> away<00:03:19.390> if<00:03:20.390> on<00:03:20.660> the

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
about an arm's length away if on the

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.870 
about an arm's length away if on the
other<00:03:21.020> hand<00:03:21.350> I'm<00:03:21.530> right<00:03:21.890> up<00:03:22.100> tight<00:03:22.430> against

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
other hand I'm right up tight against

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.380 
other hand I'm right up tight against
the<00:03:23.000> cover<00:03:23.300> I<00:03:23.680> have<00:03:24.680> to<00:03:24.830> expose<00:03:25.250> much<00:03:25.670> more<00:03:26.120> of

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
the cover I have to expose much more of

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.300 
the cover I have to expose much more of
my<00:03:26.630> body<00:03:27.050> to<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.940> threat<00:03:29.390> to<00:03:29.950> be<00:03:30.950> able<00:03:31.130> to

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
my body to the threat to be able to

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.850 
my body to the threat to be able to
engage<00:03:32.180> the<00:03:32.840> threat<00:03:34.780> so<00:03:35.780> the<00:03:36.230> farc<00:03:36.530> in<00:03:36.710> the

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
engage the threat so the farc in the

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.660 
engage the threat so the farc in the
farther<00:03:37.250> away<00:03:37.460> that<00:03:38.060> I<00:03:38.090> am<00:03:38.830> the<00:03:39.830> less<00:03:40.100> I<00:03:40.400> have

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
farther away that I am the less I have

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:48.250 
farther away that I am the less I have
to<00:03:40.880> expose<00:03:41.360> myself<00:03:41.690> to<00:03:42.910> a<00:03:44.740> threat<00:03:46.630> so<00:03:47.630> that's

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
to expose myself to a threat so that's

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
to expose myself to a threat so that's
kind<00:03:48.560> of<00:03:48.590> what<00:03:48.740> it<00:03:48.830> looks<00:03:48.860> like<00:03:49.130> we're

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
kind of what it looks like we're

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.530 
kind of what it looks like we're
actually<00:03:49.340> going<00:03:49.610> to<00:03:49.670> show<00:03:49.730> you<00:03:49.970> this<00:03:50.270> from<00:03:50.480> a

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
actually going to show you this from a

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.750 
actually going to show you this from a
shooting<00:03:50.930> perspective<00:03:51.620> so<00:03:52.100> you<00:03:52.190> can<00:03:52.460> see<00:03:52.670> it

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
shooting perspective so you can see it

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.810 
shooting perspective so you can see it
but<00:03:52.970> again<00:03:53.060> I<00:03:53.540> am<00:03:54.200> creating<00:03:54.950> about<00:03:55.280> an<00:03:55.490> arm's

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
but again I am creating about an arm's

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.110 
but again I am creating about an arm's
length<00:03:55.910> distance<00:03:56.210> from<00:03:56.900> my<00:03:57.650> cover<00:03:58.000> when<00:03:59.000> I'm

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
length distance from my cover when I'm

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.390 
length distance from my cover when I'm
transitioning<00:03:59.720> from<00:04:00.230> left<00:04:00.710> side<00:04:00.980> to<00:04:01.370> right

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
transitioning from left side to right

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.080 
transitioning from left side to right
side

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
side

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.170 
side
I'm<00:04:02.570> simply<00:04:02.960> switching<00:04:03.710> the<00:04:03.830> gun<00:04:04.100> from<00:04:04.880> my

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
I'm simply switching the gun from my

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.440 
I'm simply switching the gun from my
dominant<00:04:05.840> hand<00:04:06.170> to<00:04:06.410> my<00:04:07.190> non-dominant<00:04:08.120> hand

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
dominant hand to my non-dominant hand

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.380 
dominant hand to my non-dominant hand
and<00:04:08.660> the<00:04:09.350> reason<00:04:09.650> I'm<00:04:09.800> doing<00:04:10.010> that<00:04:10.190> is<00:04:10.580> again<00:04:11.090> I

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
and the reason I'm doing that is again I

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.000 
and the reason I'm doing that is again I
have<00:04:11.930> to<00:04:12.110> expose<00:04:12.560> less<00:04:13.370> of<00:04:13.610> my<00:04:13.820> body<00:04:14.680> if<00:04:15.680> I'm<00:04:15.980> a

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
have to expose less of my body if I'm a

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.770

exposed<00:04:56.650> so<00:04:57.370> from<00:04:57.610> a<00:04:57.700> technical<00:04:58.210> standpoint

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
exposed so from a technical standpoint

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.570 
exposed so from a technical standpoint
of<00:04:59.140> just<00:04:59.320> getting<00:04:59.500> around<00:04:59.710> the<00:05:00.220> cupboard

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
of just getting around the cupboard

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.670 
of just getting around the cupboard
that's<00:05:00.760> sort<00:05:01.240> of<00:05:01.360> what<00:05:01.600> it<00:05:01.720> looks<00:05:01.960> like<00:05:02.260> again

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
that's sort of what it looks like again

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.100 
that's sort of what it looks like again
it's<00:05:02.890> nothing<00:05:03.010> particularly<00:05:03.550> fancy<00:05:04.030> many<00:05:04.900> new

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
it's nothing particularly fancy many new

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.990 
it's nothing particularly fancy many new
shooters<00:05:05.500> have<00:05:05.710> a<00:05:05.740> tendency<00:05:06.280> to<00:05:06.310> really<00:05:06.550> crowd

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
shooters have a tendency to really crowd

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.760 
shooters have a tendency to really crowd
cover<00:05:07.360> they<00:05:07.540> get<00:05:07.720> up<00:05:07.840> as<00:05:08.050> close<00:05:08.410> as<00:05:08.620> they

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
cover they get up as close as they

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.220 
cover they get up as close as they
possibly<00:05:09.280> can<00:05:09.550> and<00:05:09.820> therefore<00:05:10.510> when<00:05:11.050> they

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:11.230 
possibly can and therefore when they

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:13.290 
possibly can and therefore when they
have<00:05:11.410> to<00:05:11.560> pie<00:05:11.800> out<00:05:11.830> around<00:05:12.520> on<00:05:12.790> either<00:05:12.970> side<00:05:13.270> of

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
have to pie out around on either side of

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.660 
have to pie out around on either side of
the<00:05:13.480> target<00:05:13.840> they<00:05:13.990> end<00:05:14.230> up<00:05:14.500> exposing<00:05:15.160> more<00:05:15.550> of

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:15.670 
the target they end up exposing more of

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.100 
the target they end up exposing more of
their<00:05:15.820> body<00:05:16.030> so<00:05:16.600> we're<00:05:16.750> going<00:05:16.870> to<00:05:16.930> show<00:05:17.080> you

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
their body so we're going to show you

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.470 
their body so we're going to show you
this<00:05:17.380> now<00:05:17.590> from<00:05:18.220> a<00:05:18.280> shooting<00:05:18.610> standpoint<00:05:19.180> just

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.480 
this now from a shooting standpoint just

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.000 
this now from a shooting standpoint just
so<00:05:19.600> you<00:05:19.660> can<00:05:19.840> kind<00:05:20.080> of<00:05:20.230> see<00:05:20.440> how<00:05:20.950> that

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
so you can kind of see how that

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.450 
so you can kind of see how that
transition<00:05:21.730> looks<00:05:22.560> again<00:05:23.560> right-handed

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
transition looks again right-handed

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.840 
transition looks again right-handed

the<00:06:10.180> other<00:06:10.210> side<00:06:10.780> and<00:06:11.140> again<00:06:11.380> what<00:06:11.710> I'm<00:06:11.800> going

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:11.980 
the other side and again what I'm going

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.310 
the other side and again what I'm going
to<00:06:12.010> do<00:06:12.160> is<00:06:12.310> I'm<00:06:12.460> going<00:06:12.640> to<00:06:12.730> work<00:06:13.300> the<00:06:13.570> gun<00:06:13.840> into

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:14.320 
to do is I'm going to work the gun into

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.950 
to do is I'm going to work the gun into
my<00:06:14.669> non-dominant<00:06:15.669> hand<00:06:16.030> so<00:06:16.360> as<00:06:16.390> I<00:06:16.570> work<00:06:16.780> the

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 
my non-dominant hand so as I work the

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.760 
my non-dominant hand so as I work the
left<00:06:17.260> side<00:06:17.560> of<00:06:17.800> the<00:06:17.890> barrier<00:06:18.250> I've<00:06:19.180> got<00:06:19.770> less

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:20.770 
left side of the barrier I've got less

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.640 
left side of the barrier I've got less
of<00:06:21.010> my<00:06:21.160> body<00:06:21.520> exposed<00:06:22.330> you<00:06:22.960> will<00:06:23.080> also<00:06:23.260> note

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:23.650 
of my body exposed you will also note

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.270 
of my body exposed you will also note
that<00:06:23.800> I<00:06:23.830> shoot<00:06:24.130> slower<00:06:24.730> with<00:06:25.830> my<00:06:26.830> left<00:06:27.130> hand

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 
that I shoot slower with my left hand

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.310 
that I shoot slower with my left hand
simply<00:06:27.850> because<00:06:28.120> I<00:06:28.180> don't<00:06:28.240> have<00:06:28.510> the<00:06:28.720> kind<00:06:29.080> of

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:29.320 
simply because I don't have the kind of

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.680 
simply because I don't have the kind of
dexterity<00:06:29.800> I<00:06:30.010> have<00:06:30.250> with<00:06:30.400> my<00:06:30.580> right<00:06:30.820> however

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:31.690 
dexterity I have with my right however

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:33.510 
dexterity I have with my right however
you'll<00:06:31.960> note<00:06:32.169> that<00:06:32.200> I'm<00:06:32.500> trying<00:06:32.860> to<00:06:32.979> get<00:06:33.130> hits

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 
you'll note that I'm trying to get hits

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.460 
you'll note that I'm trying to get hits
not<00:06:33.789> trying<00:06:34.090> to<00:06:34.180> shoot<00:06:34.419> just<00:06:34.690> as<00:06:34.840> fast<00:06:35.140> as<00:06:35.350> I

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:35.470 
not trying to shoot just as fast as I

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:36.320 
not trying to shoot just as fast as I
can

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:36.330 
can

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:39.200 
can
you<00:06:36.479> know<00:06:36.599> to<00:06:36.659> throw<00:06:36.990> rounds<00:06:37.169> downrange<00:06:38.210> so

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.210 
you know to throw rounds downrange so

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:43.999 
you know to throw rounds downrange so
come<00:06:39.419> out<00:06:41.539> now<00:06:42.539> I'm<00:06:42.629> gonna<00:06:42.750> transition<00:06:43.379> to<00:06:43.830> the

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:44.009 
come out now I'm gonna transition to the

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:53.209 
come out now I'm gonna transition to the
other<00:06:44.189> side<00:06:45.030> of<00:06:45.060> the<00:06:45.389> barrier<00:06:51.979> that's<00:06:52.979> what<00:06:53.129> it

00:06:53.209 --> 00:06:53.219 
other side of the barrier that's what it

00:06:53.219 --> 00:06:55.790 
other side of the barrier that's what it
looks<00:06:53.370> like<00:06:53.580> so<00:06:54.270> again<00:06:54.479> I'm<00:06:54.750> working<00:06:55.439> this

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 
looks like so again I'm working this

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.749 
looks like so again I'm working this
side<00:06:56.069> and<00:06:56.430> I'm<00:06:56.580> about<00:06:57.210> an<00:06:58.110> arm<00:06:58.530> length<00:06:58.800> apart

00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 
side and I'm about an arm length apart

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:03.830 
side and I'm about an arm length apart
from<00:07:00.210> the<00:07:00.719> cover<00:07:01.050> itself<00:07:01.500> if<00:07:02.490> I'm<00:07:02.819> too<00:07:03.539> close

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:03.840 
from the cover itself if I'm too close

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:09.320 
from the cover itself if I'm too close
to<00:07:04.169> cover<00:07:05.389> what<00:07:06.389> happens<00:07:07.159> is<00:07:08.159> I<00:07:08.370> end<00:07:08.639> up<00:07:08.879> having

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:09.330 
to cover what happens is I end up having

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:14.600 
to cover what happens is I end up having
to<00:07:09.360> really<00:07:12.319> stick<00:07:13.319> a<00:07:13.349> lot<00:07:13.680> more<00:07:14.009> of<00:07:14.129> my<00:07:14.280> body

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:14.610 
to really stick a lot more of my body

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.659 
to really stick a lot more of my body
out<00:07:14.879> I<00:07:15.740> think<00:07:16.740> I've<00:07:16.949> got<00:07:17.129> this<00:07:17.310> more<00:07:17.520> in<00:07:17.610> the

00:07:17.659 --> 00:07:17.669 
out I think I've got this more in the

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:32.740 
out I think I've got this more in the
middle<00:07:17.849> now<00:07:18.060> so<00:07:18.270> let's<00:07:18.449> let's<00:07:18.750> try<00:07:18.960> this<00:07:19.080> again

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:32.750 

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:35.779 

that's<00:07:33.750> what<00:07:33.930> it<00:07:34.050> looks<00:07:34.229> like<00:07:34.439> so<00:07:35.310> this<00:07:35.580> idea

00:07:35.779 --> 00:07:35.789 
that's what it looks like so this idea

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:40.550 
that's what it looks like so this idea
of<00:07:36.029> transitioning<00:07:36.870> the<00:07:36.990> gun<00:07:37.789> from<00:07:38.789> here<00:07:39.409> to<00:07:40.409> my

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:40.560 
of transitioning the gun from here to my

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:45.559 
of transitioning the gun from here to my
left<00:07:40.860> hand<00:07:41.960> back<00:07:42.960> to<00:07:43.139> my<00:07:43.259> right<00:07:43.969> is<00:07:44.969> one<00:07:45.389> that

00:07:45.559 --> 00:07:45.569 
left hand back to my right is one that

00:07:45.569 --> 00:07:47.269 
left hand back to my right is one that
allows<00:07:45.659> me<00:07:46.110> to<00:07:46.139> shoot<00:07:46.409> from<00:07:46.620> either<00:07:46.919> side<00:07:47.250> of

00:07:47.269 --> 00:07:47.279 
allows me to shoot from either side of

00:07:47.279 --> 00:07:49.700 
allows me to shoot from either side of
cover<00:07:47.729> without<00:07:48.419> having<00:07:48.750> to<00:07:48.900> expose<00:07:49.259> a<00:07:49.289> lot<00:07:49.590> of

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:49.710 
cover without having to expose a lot of

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:51.920 
cover without having to expose a lot of
my<00:07:49.830> body<00:07:50.009> so<00:07:50.789> anyway<00:07:51.000> that's<00:07:51.120> a<00:07:51.300> quick<00:07:51.539> look<00:07:51.779> at

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:51.930 
my body so anyway that's a quick look at

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:54.499 
my body so anyway that's a quick look at
that<00:07:52.080> hopefully<00:07:52.560> that<00:07:52.589> provides<00:07:53.310> some<00:07:53.879> value

00:07:54.499 --> 00:07:54.509 
that hopefully that provides some value

00:07:54.509 --> 00:07:56.749 
that hopefully that provides some value

about<00:07:57.089> this<00:07:57.300> AR<00:07:57.569> it's<00:07:57.719> taken<00:07:58.050> so<00:07:58.199> long<00:07:58.229> to

00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:58.440 
about this AR it's taken so long to

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.019 
about this AR it's taken so long to
actually<00:07:58.710> produce<00:07:59.129> this<00:07:59.460> video<00:07:59.789> but

00:08:00.019 --> 00:08:00.029 
actually produce this video but

00:08:00.029 --> 00:08:02.390 
actually produce this video but
hopefully<00:08:00.180> this<00:08:00.509> will<00:08:00.569> help<00:08:00.949> the<00:08:01.949> main<00:08:02.129> thing

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:02.400 
hopefully this will help the main thing

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.939 
hopefully this will help the main thing
with<00:08:02.669> cover<00:08:03.000> don't<00:08:03.810> get<00:08:04.020> too<00:08:04.199> close<00:08:04.409> because

00:08:04.939 --> 00:08:04.949 
with cover don't get too close because

00:08:04.949 --> 00:08:07.189 
with cover don't get too close because
you<00:08:05.099> have<00:08:05.400> to<00:08:05.580> expose<00:08:05.940> more<00:08:06.330> of<00:08:06.389> your<00:08:06.629> body<00:08:06.839> to

00:08:07.189 --> 00:08:07.199 
you have to expose more of your body to

00:08:07.199 --> 00:08:09.800 
you have to expose more of your body to
