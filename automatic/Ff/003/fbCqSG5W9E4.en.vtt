and<00:00:30.240> we'll<00:00:30.390> lay<00:00:30.510> out<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.630> first<00:00:30.900> rail<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.470> we'll

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
and we'll lay out a first rail and we'll

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:39.610 
and we'll lay out a first rail and we'll
measure<00:00:31.859> according<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.489> instructions

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.960 

we<00:00:40.620> found<00:00:40.860> our<00:00:40.980> length<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.490> we<00:00:41.610> need<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.790> set

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:41.970 
we found our length that we need to set

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.000 
we found our length that we need to set
it<00:00:42.090> at<00:00:42.240> we'll<00:00:42.660> put<00:00:42.810> a<00:00:42.840> rail<00:00:43.050> there<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.560> then

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
it at we'll put a rail there and then

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.260 
it at we'll put a rail there and then
we'll<00:00:44.160> make<00:00:44.250> sure<00:00:44.400> it's<00:00:44.550> even<00:00:44.820> from<00:00:45.000> left<00:00:45.210> to

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
we'll make sure it's even from left to

5th wheel hitch in before we tighten

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:29.700 
5th wheel hitch in before we tighten
everything<00:04:28.600> down<00:04:28.870> we'll<00:04:29.200> use<00:04:29.290> the<00:04:29.410> hitch<00:04:29.530> as<00:04:29.650> a

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
everything down we'll use the hitch as a

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.219 
everything down we'll use the hitch as a
guide<00:04:29.979> so<00:04:30.430> as<00:04:30.550> it<00:04:30.669> draws<00:04:30.820> down<00:04:31.150> it<00:04:31.810> won't<00:04:31.990> bind

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
guide so as it draws down it won't bind

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:34.350 
guide so as it draws down it won't bind
up<00:04:32.500> now<00:04:32.950> we'll<00:04:33.070> Snug<00:04:33.310> it<00:04:33.370> down<00:04:33.430> test<00:04:34.060> it<00:04:34.210> and

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
up now we'll Snug it down test it and

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.210 
up now we'll Snug it down test it and
then<00:04:34.570> tie<00:04:34.720> it<00:04:34.750> down<00:04:35.020> for<00:04:35.260> good<00:04:35.290> well<00:04:35.889> tighten

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
then tie it down for good well tighten

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.980 
then tie it down for good well tighten
down<00:04:36.340> the<00:04:36.490> bolts<00:04:36.790> to<00:04:36.850> go<00:04:36.880> from<00:04:37.180> the<00:04:37.300> rail<00:04:37.479> to

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
down the bolts to go from the rail to
