00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.060
Good morning from Marrakech!

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.060
Today, we’re going to meet Ammour

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.060
Ammour’s day started early

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.400
Let’s go and meet him so he can share with us how to prepare the most delicious Couscous.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.060
And that’s Ammour!

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.060
Welcome!

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.060
I have been waiting for you.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.120
I woke up early, wore my clothes and got ready.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.800
And here I am all ready to start.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.440
But first, I am going to drink tea before I leave.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.320
Rest assured, I have bought most of the ingredients,

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.840
and we will now go together to the “Mallah” to buy the aromatic herbs and the needed spices.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.860
Hello, how are you?

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.340
Hello sir! How are you? Doing well?

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.940
I would like the usual aromatic herbal mix.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.260
We are going to prepare the best couscous dish ever with chicken and vegetables.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.880
Everything here reminds me of my mother who was by the way a great cook.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.580
She used to tell me that the success of any dish is related to choosing the right aromatic herbal mix.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.280
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to welcome you all.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.880
And now let the symphony of the Moroccan couscous begin!

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.520
I will start by chopping the onions and the tomatoes, then I will add the chicken and cook them in a pot.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.980
This pumpkin comes from a region in Morocco called “Doukkala”

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.360
We pour one liter of water

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.840
And now, we will add the spices that we’ve grinded by hand

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.840
We sprinkle a pinch of salt, adding a bit of ghee and one cup of olive oil

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.680
We leave the mixture to simmer

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.040
And now it’s time to cook the couscous grains the traditional way

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.780
Once we’re done, we put them over here

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.840
This dish helps us traditionally cook the couscous our ancestors’ way

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.840
We place it here, and then repeat the same process one more time

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.680
We uncover the couscous and rub the grains well

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.120
Pay attention not to burn your hands for it might be hot.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.640
Afterwards, we cook it and repeat the rubbing process for the third time.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.840
and after ten minutes, you will see the result!

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.960
And now, it’s the moment of truth. Let’s taste the couscous we’ve prepared

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.760
The audience must share with me this taste!

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.600
Morocco, Marrakech, Ammour

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.300
and his special way of making Couscous…

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.480
Meet us soon for new rounds in the streets of new cities

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.400
with #Tefal_Gathers.
