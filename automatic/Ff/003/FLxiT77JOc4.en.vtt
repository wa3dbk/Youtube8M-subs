00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:18.950
 we started with the interview although in 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:21.800
 2008 2010 2012 you are not bored anymore 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:25.340
 win big tournaments you know this 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:29.030
 of winning one never tire another year 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.270
 more without vacations almost like it lives a 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:34.680
 goodbye nonsense please 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:37.930
 I think you always have to love 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.250
 go to the top and reach the world cup is 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.220
 the biggest thing you can do 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.410
 soccer player we return to 2010 you 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.420
 remember when I read this the pass to 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.730
 iniesta to take all the 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.180
 glory could not have thought about kicking 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.970
 and so we do not carry it both 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.060
 if many times we have thought it true 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.150
 I believe that 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.590
 that was a moment that you have to take 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.440
 a decision 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:06.500
 you have two basically you were kicked 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.600
 nothing happened at the end everything went well 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.410
 How do you help these victories to believe 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.960
 more in your colleagues I think it's vital 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:17.690
 Until 2008 nobody believed in us anymore 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.090
 from there now, because I think that we 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.340
 we have made a name and we have made 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.830
 a very competitive team that has 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.290
 won everything you do not remember in the first 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.000
 2010 World Cup match that you lost 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.460
 against Switzerland I was thinking if at some point 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.220
 that you could be eliminated from the 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.640
 World Cup in the group stage I think that 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:40.280
 were difficult moments were days 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.470
 I remember many nerves me 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.570
 agreement everyone expected that to be the 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.390
 easier or more affordable party 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.240
 the whole group and that shows you that a 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.800
 World Cup are never easy and 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.530
 I think it was a lesson that we have 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.140
 what to learn for this world 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.180
 the first match in the 2014 World Cup is 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.479
 against holland it 's a bit a repeat 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.970
 of the end of 2010 as you see the match 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.549
 man I see it a very match 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.940
 interesting is also in the head of 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:12.290
 all because the final and how it happened was a 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.049
 very competitive final 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.180
 very exciting vibrant sure they're going 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:19.609
 to want to have a moment also 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.950
 good against us also predicted 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:23.840
 this match please 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.989
 the prognosis always of trying to win 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.579
 If Spain were not in the World Cup with 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:32.150
 who would you go with the argentina de messi 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:34.640
 with Brazil from Neymar which of your 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.159
 Preferred colleagues that thanks 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.079
 it's hard I can not answer you this 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:41.510
 I do not want anyone to win says no 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.920
 I do not even want to imagine the question how 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.480
 it would be if in reality we do not 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.480
 we were there so I prefer 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.980
 the car and more and a question facilitates 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.900
 who will win the world cup Spain valero 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.019
 world and you know that to score the goal of 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.019
 the final 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.140
 and
