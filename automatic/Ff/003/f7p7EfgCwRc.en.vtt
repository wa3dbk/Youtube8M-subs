the<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.470> new<00:01:55.890> thing<00:01:56.099> at<00:01:56.190> the<00:01:56.250> bottom<00:01:56.459> here<00:01:56.580> it

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
the the new thing at the bottom here it

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.999 
the the new thing at the bottom here it
says<00:01:57.450> I've<00:01:57.630> collected<00:01:57.840> 60<00:01:58.289> times<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.709> collect

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
says I've collected 60 times I collect

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.219 
says I've collected 60 times I collect
five<00:01:59.220> more<00:01:59.489> the<00:02:00.270> meep<00:02:00.450> attacks<00:02:00.869> strike

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
five more the meep attacks strike

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.870 
five more the meep attacks strike
through<00:02:01.500> cone<00:02:01.800> increases<00:02:02.340> in<00:02:02.459> size<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:02.819> it

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
through cone increases in size so it

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.749 
through cone increases in size so it
becomes<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.209> bigger<00:02:03.420> AoE<00:02:03.810> each<00:02:04.110> time<00:02:04.349> I<00:02:04.440> do<00:02:04.500> it

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
becomes a bigger AoE each time I do it

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.889 
becomes a bigger AoE each time I do it
so<00:02:05.759> just<00:02:05.940> to<00:02:06.030> show<00:02:06.179> off<00:02:06.209> what<00:02:06.390> disabilities

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
so just to show off what disabilities

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.870 
so just to show off what disabilities
actually<00:02:07.200> look<00:02:07.410> like<00:02:07.440> we're<00:02:08.009> gonna<00:02:08.130> use<00:02:08.610> the

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
actually look like we're gonna use the

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.630 
actually look like we're gonna use the
root<00:02:09.149> thing<00:02:09.450> or<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.810> stun<00:02:10.050> thing<00:02:10.319> rather<00:02:10.640> you

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
root thing or the stun thing rather you

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.850 
root thing or the stun thing rather you
can<00:02:11.760> see<00:02:11.940> it<00:02:12.060> goes<00:02:12.270> through<00:02:12.569> him<00:02:12.810> and<00:02:13.020> hit<00:02:13.680> the

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
can see it goes through him and hit the

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.910 
can see it goes through him and hit the
wall<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.459> so<00:02:15.150> I<00:02:15.450> get<00:02:15.989> a<00:02:16.280> stunned<00:02:17.280> him<00:02:18.860> now<00:02:19.860> you

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
because i have meeps meeps don't seem to

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.160 
because i have meeps meeps don't seem to
be<00:02:24.150> affected<00:02:24.540> by<00:02:24.629> cooldown<00:02:25.050> reduction

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
be affected by cooldown reduction

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.130 
be affected by cooldown reduction
they're<00:02:25.590> just<00:02:25.739> like<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:25.950> static<00:02:26.430> thing<00:02:26.989> so<00:02:27.989> it's

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
they're just like a static thing so it's

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.990 
they're just like a static thing so it's
just<00:02:28.319> how<00:02:28.440> that<00:02:28.590> works<00:02:28.770> um<00:02:29.099> no<00:02:29.489> there's<00:02:29.879> the

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
just how that works um no there's the

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.420 
just how that works um no there's the
health<00:02:30.209> pack<00:02:30.420> thing<00:02:30.720> that<00:02:31.590> thing<00:02:31.800> you<00:02:32.190> kind<00:02:32.400> of

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
health pack thing that thing you kind of

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.309 
health pack thing that thing you kind of
put<00:02:32.580> it<00:02:32.670> down<00:02:32.819> on<00:02:32.849> the<00:02:33.090> ground<00:02:33.270> and<00:02:33.540> you<00:02:34.140> leave

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
put it down on the ground and you leave

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:35.900 
put it down on the ground and you leave
it<00:02:34.440> for<00:02:34.560> 10<00:02:34.680> seconds<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.489> longer<00:02:35.790> you

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
it for 10 seconds and the longer you

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.150 
it for 10 seconds and the longer you
leave<00:02:36.090> it<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.500> more<00:02:37.500> health<00:02:37.770> will<00:02:37.920> give<00:02:38.099> you

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
leave it the more health will give you

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.140 
leave it the more health will give you
back<00:02:38.310> when<00:02:38.489> you<00:02:38.550> ultimately<00:02:38.940> end<00:02:39.090> up

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
back when you ultimately end up

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.290 
back when you ultimately end up
collecting<00:02:39.360> it<00:02:40.819> again<00:02:41.819> so<00:02:41.940> I'm<00:02:42.000> not<00:02:42.120> going<00:02:42.239> to

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
collecting it again so I'm not going to

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.910 
collecting it again so I'm not going to
talk<00:02:42.690> about<00:02:42.840> numbers<00:02:43.230> too<00:02:43.440> much<00:02:43.560> because<00:02:43.709> it's

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
talk about numbers too much because it's

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.470 
talk about numbers too much because it's
really<00:02:44.040> early<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:44.489> these<00:02:44.819> numbers<00:02:45.269> will

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
really early and these numbers will

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.000 
really early and these numbers will
change<00:02:45.510> that's<00:02:46.170> just<00:02:46.319> how<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.470> public<00:02:46.680> test

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
change that's just how the public test

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.910 
change that's just how the public test
realm<00:02:47.099> works<00:02:47.750> next<00:02:48.750> let's<00:02:48.989> put<00:02:49.290> down<00:02:49.530> his

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
realm works next let's put down his

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.790 
realm works next let's put down his
magical<00:02:50.730> journey<00:02:51.000> so<00:02:51.269> this<00:02:51.450> will<00:02:51.660> put<00:02:52.290> a<00:02:52.410> mark

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
magical journey so this will put a mark

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.500 
magical journey so this will put a mark
on<00:02:52.950> a<00:02:53.010> wall<00:02:53.340> somewhere<00:02:53.640> basically<00:02:54.090> any<00:02:54.209> kind

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
on a wall somewhere basically any kind

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.660 
on a wall somewhere basically any kind
of<00:02:54.569> terrain<00:02:54.720> although<00:02:55.500> not<00:02:55.770> champion<00:02:56.340> created

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
of terrain although not champion created

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:57.670 
of terrain although not champion created
terrain

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
terrain

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.949 
terrain
and<00:02:57.769> then<00:02:58.370> it'll<00:02:58.700> be<00:02:58.730> making<00:02:59.420> sort<00:02:59.599> of<00:02:59.659> a<00:02:59.719> gate

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
and then it'll be making sort of a gate

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.380 
and then it'll be making sort of a gate
that<00:02:59.989> passes<00:03:00.500> through<00:03:00.530> to<00:03:00.799> the<00:03:00.890> other<00:03:00.950> end<00:03:01.390> so

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
that passes through to the other end so

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.630 
that passes through to the other end so
right<00:03:02.569> here<00:03:02.599> as<00:03:02.870> you<00:03:02.930> can<00:03:02.989> see<00:03:03.109> is<00:03:03.530> that<00:03:03.709> I<00:03:04.010> go

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
right here as you can see is that I go

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.800 
right here as you can see is that I go
in<00:03:04.790> it<00:03:04.909> I'm<00:03:05.030> going<00:03:05.150> to<00:03:05.209> go<00:03:05.329> all<00:03:05.480> the<00:03:05.569> way<00:03:05.599> over

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
in it I'm going to go all the way over

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.080 
in it I'm going to go all the way over
here<00:03:05.870> it<00:03:06.620> doesn't<00:03:06.920> matter<00:03:07.219> how<00:03:07.549> long<00:03:07.879> the

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
here it doesn't matter how long the

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.160 
here it doesn't matter how long the
terrain<00:03:08.329> is<00:03:08.540> it<00:03:08.629> looks<00:03:08.780> like<00:03:08.930> for<00:03:09.109> example

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
terrain is it looks like for example

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.030 
terrain is it looks like for example
I've<00:03:09.590> done<00:03:09.890> a<00:03:10.420> wall<00:03:11.420> or<00:03:11.810> a<00:03:11.900> gate<00:03:12.260> all<00:03:12.500> along

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
I've done a wall or a gate all along

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.800 
I've done a wall or a gate all along
like<00:03:13.280> here<00:03:13.760> I<00:03:13.790> think<00:03:14.000> yeah<00:03:14.269> I<00:03:14.299> came<00:03:14.569> all<00:03:14.750> the

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
like here I think yeah I came all the

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.629 
like here I think yeah I came all the
way<00:03:14.870> down<00:03:14.959> like<00:03:15.650> out<00:03:15.799> there<00:03:16.040> so<00:03:16.340> it<00:03:16.430> can<00:03:16.549> be

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:16.639 
way down like out there so it can be

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:18.580 
way down like out there so it can be
quite<00:03:16.849> long<00:03:17.180> or<00:03:17.629> can<00:03:17.840> be<00:03:17.930> extremely<00:03:18.200> short<00:03:18.500> it

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
quite long or can be extremely short it

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:19.929 
quite long or can be extremely short it
would<00:03:18.680> just<00:03:18.739> be<00:03:18.859> a<00:03:18.889> small<00:03:19.189> wall<00:03:19.400> like<00:03:19.609> this<00:03:19.760> as

00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:19.939 
would just be a small wall like this as

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:22.509 
would just be a small wall like this as
you<00:03:19.969> can<00:03:20.120> see<00:03:20.239> pastor<00:03:21.109> that<00:03:21.260> like<00:03:21.469> that<00:03:21.650> it's

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
you can see pastor that like that it's

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.720 
you can see pastor that like that it's
one<00:03:22.790> ways<00:03:23.030> you<00:03:23.269> can't<00:03:23.510> go<00:03:23.629> back<00:03:23.959> and<00:03:24.730> lastly

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
one ways you can't go back and lastly

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.819 
one ways you can't go back and lastly
there's<00:03:25.939> his<00:03:26.090> alt<00:03:26.530> basically<00:03:27.530> what<00:03:27.709> it<00:03:27.739> does

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
there's his alt basically what it does

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:31.360 
there's his alt basically what it does
is<00:03:28.340> imagine<00:03:29.060> you<00:03:29.569> get<00:03:29.780> an<00:03:29.900> AoE<00:03:30.260> zhonya's<00:03:30.980> skill

shot<00:03:32.200> so<00:03:33.200> basically<00:03:33.470> you<00:03:33.590> take<00:03:33.859> something<00:03:34.189> out

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
shot so basically you take something out

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.490 
shot so basically you take something out
of<00:03:34.579> combat<00:03:35.389> instead<00:03:35.900> of<00:03:35.989> out<00:03:36.079> of<00:03:36.109> the<00:03:36.260> game<00:03:36.470> I

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
of combat instead of out of the game I

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.589 
of combat instead of out of the game I
suppose<00:03:36.980> so<00:03:37.459> it's<00:03:37.579> kind<00:03:37.760> of<00:03:37.790> like<00:03:37.879> a<00:03:37.939> stun<00:03:38.329> and

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:40.599
