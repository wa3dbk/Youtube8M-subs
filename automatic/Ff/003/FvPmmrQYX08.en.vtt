that<00:03:24.700> wise<00:03:24.940> it<00:03:25.239> will<00:03:25.420> probably<00:03:25.690> be<00:03:25.810> similar<00:03:26.230> to

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
that wise it will probably be similar to

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.990 
that wise it will probably be similar to
this<00:03:26.560> may<00:03:26.830> be<00:03:26.890> his<00:03:27.070> pace<00:03:27.340> will<00:03:27.610> be<00:03:27.730> dropped

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
this may be his pace will be dropped

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.660 
this may be his pace will be dropped
slightly<00:03:28.810> because<00:03:29.590> it<00:03:29.860> was<00:03:29.980> age<00:03:30.220> you<00:03:30.519> know<00:03:30.640> a

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
slightly because it was age you know a

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.550 
slightly because it was age you know a
fee<00:03:30.970> for<00:03:31.000> a<00:03:31.269> like<00:03:31.450> when<00:03:31.690> people<00:03:31.989> start<00:03:32.290> hitting

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
fee for a like when people start hitting

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.220 
fee for a like when people start hitting
over<00:03:32.680> 30<00:03:33.070> they<00:03:33.760> do<00:03:33.820> drop<00:03:34.150> their<00:03:34.360> a<00:03:34.390> pace<00:03:34.989> a<00:03:35.019> bit

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
over 30 they do drop their a pace a bit

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.530 
over 30 they do drop their a pace a bit
but<00:03:35.769> anything<00:03:36.250> sort<00:03:36.820> of<00:03:36.940> similar<00:03:37.090> to<00:03:37.360> that

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
but anything sort of similar to that

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.390 
but anything sort of similar to that
it's<00:03:37.780> gonna<00:03:37.900> be<00:03:37.989> a<00:03:38.110> decent<00:03:38.380> well-rounded<00:03:39.130> card
