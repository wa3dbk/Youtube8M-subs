00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:04.609
 hello for a little focus of view of the 2012 season 

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.279
 know that the club this machine in the category netbooks 

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:10.719
 and for me it's much more its place in the category of 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:12.939
 ultraportable the coach 

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:16.199
 begins with the carcass that yesterday brilliant so for a possible 

00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:18.419
 with on the side 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:21.820
 for the connection card reader the audio jacks 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.720
 headset the first usb port 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.399
 let yourself complain 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:28.829
 two sides 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:30.759
 Attached port of 6 tons 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.890
 corrected power port harper the last two carry my ideas 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:36.940
 remember 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.330
 the 3-cell battery 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.930
 while dell proposes for this beginning of season 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.930
 a 6 cell hair cut battery at the dell site 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.540
 vivid scalability 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.540
 it had not been reported any trace of this article 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.890
 to the different components 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.320
 I am now doing a little 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.000
 comparative and clutter an officer of the new ipod 10 2 m 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.430
 superimpose 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.710
 an ultraportable see that the difference is really 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.920
 and if I dare the comparison priklopil pc 901 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.470
 the psalm 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.200
 we must still greet 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.250
 after such acts 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.250
 the machine on a year 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.720
 if I compare my 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.030
 we can see that the Christmas train 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.030
 the ethics committee asse 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.700
 so six days now the accuracy 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.450
 meet the screen is a brilliant screen 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.500
 by the fall 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.520
 next door it's just the witness who said the club is powered 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.340
 since the microphone is 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.599
 side unemployment rate 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.809
 it is an integral part of the carcass 

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:15.009
 so it's also 

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:18.009
 a good point for her what does it do to perfect integration 

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:20.969
 displeased 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:23.969
 the commitment easily top 

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:28.069
 little dead point all the same it's the keyboard 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.549
 so when we see at the moment of a loop 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.339
 the only version of the tale 

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:36.859
 but here keys 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:41.489
 one size we say that m already really the ferry will leave his club 

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:49.559
 suddenly 

00:02:50.919 --> 00:02:54.069
 for this usb key and it is to be able to repair underline the experts 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.070
 this command the same document the 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.600
 gold threads 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.830
 or else with the module all the version sp place just to go out so I do not have 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.830
 had the opportunity to have a native xp version 

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:14.709
 so something that would also like surprised source loops 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.249
 if we are going to say the slowness of Sunday 

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:19.290
 that's the last eight hits 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.669
 60 gigas 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:22.079
 I think I'm so far 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:23.070
 gradually 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.079
 compared 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.349
 for example his misclassified team 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:28.369
 or for millions 

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:29.190
 s 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.369
 12 11 and the officer who told him 

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:34.369
 he died on a hard drive 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.720
 nice speakers is here 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.749
 right here 

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:43.749
 coach is he from the bottom of the bucket but relatively good 

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:48.039
 first interesting thing we'll say it's the resolution of this netbook 

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:50.579
 with its 12-inch screen 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:53.479
 allows us to have a really interesting resolution 

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:54.719
 we are more 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:04:00.109
 in 2 24 in this sense that is the case on the majority of netbooks 10 inches 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:01.479
 good nine inches 

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:04.479
 we are on a strain managing a dose 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:09.639
 1280 by 800 

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:15.429
 another interesting thing ahead on this apple netbook which is equipped 

00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:17.630
 a z-series atom processor 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.609
 with horses 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.189
 parliament it was said that this chipset could decompress video page 

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:24.330
 web 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.259
 yes I took the opportunity to download 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:29.289
 a small trait to their entourage of the magnitude in the small crown 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:32.849
 this trait being in 720 p -j 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.009
 he offers a little reading for me 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:40.009
 what it gives 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:45.870
 so video but relatively chilly 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.050
 that's a little bit of the eyes so it's 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.050
 in any case otherwise 

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:53.539
 so future development 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:54.919
 however, m 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:58.569
 I better test with 720p video with a bitrate 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:01.309
 much larger and it turns out that 

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:04.059
 it's called abduction 

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:06.419
 this netbook 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:10.729
 z series tray processor can actually say hd videos but it takes 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:13.680
 not that the data flow is too important 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.680
 otherwise for them it's quite an effective 

00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:26.599
 here is every day offers to find the rest of this action but 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:27.569
 good three young men
