hi i'm jay from real street performance

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.000 
hi i'm jay from real street performance
today<00:00:21.750> we're<00:00:21.869> going<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.050> talk<00:00:22.199> about<00:00:22.380> piston

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
today we're going to talk about piston

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.089 
today we're going to talk about piston
pins'<00:00:26.720> so<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.990> piston<00:00:28.349> pins'<00:00:28.590> are<00:00:28.769> kind<00:00:28.949> of<00:00:28.980> an

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
pins' so the piston pins' are kind of an

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.429 
pins' so the piston pins' are kind of an
unsung<00:00:29.670> hero<00:00:29.699> in<00:00:30.210> your<00:00:30.300> engine<00:00:30.689> they're<00:00:31.289> not

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
unsung hero in your engine they're not

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.560 
unsung hero in your engine they're not
exotic<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.219> look<00:00:32.399> at<00:00:32.579> they're<00:00:33.000> not<00:00:33.090> exciting

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
exotic to look at they're not exciting

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.720 
exotic to look at they're not exciting
to<00:00:33.600> talk<00:00:33.870> about<00:00:34.230> you<00:00:34.590> don't<00:00:34.770> tell<00:00:35.340> somebody

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
to talk about you don't tell somebody

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.479 
to talk about you don't tell somebody
that<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:36.090> bought<00:00:36.710> Pistons<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.890> rods<00:00:37.950> and

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
that you bought Pistons and rods and

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.610 
that you bought Pistons and rods and
pins<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.750> just<00:00:39.930> tell<00:00:40.079> them<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.469> have

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
pins you just tell them that you have

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.680 
pins you just tell them that you have
upgraded<00:00:40.800> Pistons<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.579> rods<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:42.210> pins<00:00:42.450> are

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
upgraded Pistons and rods the pins are

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.930 
upgraded Pistons and rods the pins are
very<00:00:42.989> important<00:00:43.590> if<00:00:43.950> you're<00:00:44.160> using<00:00:44.430> a

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
very important if you're using a

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.340 
very important if you're using a
turbocharger<00:00:45.780> or<00:00:45.809> nitrous<00:00:46.260> supercharger

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.380 

and<00:00:51.920> you're<00:00:52.100> using<00:00:52.280> the<00:00:52.579> standard<00:00:53.030> pin<00:00:53.239> that

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
and you're using the standard pin that

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.600 
and you're using the standard pin that
came<00:00:53.570> delivered<00:00:53.989> with<00:00:54.140> the<00:00:54.230> piston<00:00:54.650> there's<00:00:55.520> a

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
came delivered with the piston there's a

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:56.890 
came delivered with the piston there's a
good<00:00:55.850> chance<00:00:56.090> that<00:00:56.210> you're<00:00:56.390> gonna<00:00:56.450> overwhelm

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:56.900 
good chance that you're gonna overwhelm

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.260 
good chance that you're gonna overwhelm
that<00:00:57.350> pin<00:00:57.620> the<00:00:58.190> pin<00:00:58.400> was<00:00:58.579> only<00:00:58.820> designed<00:00:58.970> for

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
that pin the pin was only designed for

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.310 
that pin the pin was only designed for
so<00:00:59.540> much<00:00:59.690> stress<00:01:00.200> and<00:01:00.580> the<00:01:01.580> way<00:01:01.700> that<00:01:01.879> they

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
so much stress and the way that they

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.930 
so much stress and the way that they
increase<00:01:03.320> its<00:01:03.559> durability<00:01:04.010> is<00:01:04.430> with<00:01:04.790> an

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
increase its durability is with an

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.880 
increase its durability is with an
increased<00:01:05.269> wall<00:01:05.540> thickness<00:01:05.990> or<00:01:06.200> a<00:01:06.260> material

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
increased wall thickness or a material

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.340 
increased wall thickness or a material
change<00:01:06.920> and<00:01:07.610> that<00:01:08.300> will<00:01:08.479> allow<00:01:08.720> the<00:01:08.780> piston

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
change and that will allow the piston

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.730 
change and that will allow the piston
pin<00:01:09.530> to<00:01:09.890> deal<00:01:10.070> with<00:01:10.250> the<00:01:10.430> stress<00:01:10.759> and<00:01:10.790> load<00:01:11.270> of

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
pin to deal with the stress and load of

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.370 
pin to deal with the stress and load of
the<00:01:12.740> force<00:01:13.340> induction<00:01:13.850> or<00:01:14.090> nitrous<00:01:14.509> better

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
the force induction or nitrous better

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.219 
the force induction or nitrous better
than<00:01:15.680> a<00:01:15.920> standard<00:01:16.340> pin<00:01:16.610> when<00:01:17.390> the<00:01:17.600> pin<00:01:17.840> breaks

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
than a standard pin when the pin breaks

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.290 
than a standard pin when the pin breaks
if<00:01:18.710> you<00:01:18.920> use<00:01:19.100> a<00:01:19.130> standard<00:01:19.610> pin<00:01:19.820> and<00:01:19.970> it<00:01:20.060> breaks

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
if you use a standard pin and it breaks

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.260 
if you use a standard pin and it breaks
it<00:01:20.479> is<00:01:20.660> a<00:01:20.690> catastrophic<00:01:21.110> failure<00:01:22.270> everything

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
it is a catastrophic failure everything

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.139 
it is a catastrophic failure everything
that<00:01:23.899> was<00:01:24.110> your<00:01:24.350> engine<00:01:24.800> goes<00:01:25.550> in<00:01:25.700> the<00:01:25.789> garbage

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
that was your engine goes in the garbage

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:28.570 
that was your engine goes in the garbage
and<00:01:26.539> you<00:01:27.050> have<00:01:27.289> to<00:01:27.500> start<00:01:27.860> over<00:01:28.039> again<00:01:28.190> because

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
and you have to start over again because

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.690 
and you have to start over again because
when<00:01:29.000> it<00:01:29.119> breaks<00:01:29.390> the<00:01:30.160> small<00:01:31.160> end<00:01:31.369> of<00:01:31.430> the<00:01:31.520> rod

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
when it breaks the small end of the rod

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.300 
when it breaks the small end of the rod
is<00:01:31.940> now<00:01:32.090> free<00:01:32.450> to<00:01:32.570> roam<00:01:32.780> knocks<00:01:33.710> a<00:01:33.860> hole<00:01:34.009> in<00:01:34.190> the

is now free to roam knocks a hole in the

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.850 
is now free to roam knocks a hole in the
cylinder<00:01:34.640> wall<00:01:35.229> kind<00:01:36.229> of<00:01:36.289> just<00:01:36.500> a<00:01:36.560> bunch<00:01:36.710> of

cylinder wall kind of just a bunch of

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.410 
cylinder wall kind of just a bunch of
stuff<00:01:37.039> swinging<00:01:37.460> around<00:01:37.550> just<00:01:37.940> turns<00:01:38.119> into<00:01:38.330> a

stuff swinging around just turns into a

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.690 
stuff swinging around just turns into a
real<00:01:38.630> ugly<00:01:39.020> situation<00:01:39.680> so<00:01:40.100> in<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:40.310> realm<00:01:40.520> of

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
real ugly situation so in the realm of

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.999 
real ugly situation so in the realm of
upgrading<00:01:41.390> your<00:01:41.509> piston<00:01:41.869> pins'<00:01:42.110> it's<00:01:42.770> not<00:01:42.979> a

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
upgrading your piston pins' it's not a

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.550 
upgrading your piston pins' it's not a
very<00:01:43.280> large<00:01:43.460> expense<00:01:43.970> when<00:01:44.380> someone<00:01:45.380> buys<00:01:45.530> a

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
very large expense when someone buys a

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.499 
very large expense when someone buys a
four<00:01:46.220> cylinder<00:01:46.460> set<00:01:46.670> of<00:01:46.759> Pistons<00:01:47.149> from<00:01:47.270> real

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
that the pin is flexing but the piston

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.289 
that the pin is flexing but the piston
is<00:02:17.930> also<00:02:18.380> flexing<00:02:18.920> you<00:02:19.190> know<00:02:19.280> when<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.579> piston

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
is also flexing you know when the piston

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:21.940 
is also flexing you know when the piston
changes<00:02:20.750> direction<00:02:21.260> when<00:02:21.410> it<00:02:21.530> goes<00:02:21.680> from

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
changes direction when it goes from

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.819 
changes direction when it goes from
bottom<00:02:22.700> dead<00:02:22.880> center<00:02:23.269> on<00:02:23.480> its<00:02:23.959> way<00:02:24.110> up<00:02:24.260> or<00:02:24.440> top

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:24.829 
bottom dead center on its way up or top

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:27.100 
bottom dead center on its way up or top
dead<00:02:25.010> center<00:02:25.370> on<00:02:25.519> its<00:02:25.820> way<00:02:25.940> back<00:02:26.090> down<00:02:26.390> you

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
dead center on its way back down you

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.960 
dead center on its way back down you
know<00:02:27.230> there's<00:02:27.430> 4,000<00:02:28.430> G's<00:02:28.670> of<00:02:28.940> force

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
know there's 4,000 G's of force

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.120 
know there's 4,000 G's of force
available<00:02:29.780> as<00:02:29.989> that<00:02:30.290> piston<00:02:30.680> is<00:02:30.769> kind<00:02:31.040> of

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
available as that piston is kind of

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.180 
available as that piston is kind of
yoked<00:02:31.489> in<00:02:31.730> the<00:02:32.299> opposite<00:02:32.660> direction<00:02:32.810> so<00:02:33.350> the

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
yoked in the opposite direction so the

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.539 
yoked in the opposite direction so the
the<00:02:34.850> parts<00:02:35.480> are<00:02:35.750> going<00:02:35.959> to<00:02:36.280> have<00:02:37.280> some

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
the parts are going to have some

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.250 
the parts are going to have some
deflection<00:02:37.820> and<00:02:38.360> you<00:02:38.570> can<00:02:38.690> see<00:02:38.930> some<00:02:39.140> of<00:02:39.230> that

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
deflection and you can see some of that

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.220 
deflection and you can see some of that
deflection<00:02:39.709> in<00:02:40.100> a<00:02:40.700> harder<00:02:41.030> run<00:02:41.209> engine<00:02:41.600> in<00:02:41.840> the

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
deflection in a harder run engine in the

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.949 
deflection in a harder run engine in the
pin<00:02:42.440> boss<00:02:42.680> as<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:43.700> piston<00:02:44.000> flexes<00:02:44.690> and<00:02:44.870> the

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
pin boss as the piston flexes and the

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.590 
pin boss as the piston flexes and the
pin<00:02:45.140> flexes<00:02:45.650> but<00:02:46.400> again<00:02:46.640> having<00:02:47.090> an<00:02:47.209> upgraded

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
pin flexes but again having an upgraded

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.590 
pin flexes but again having an upgraded
pin<00:02:47.930> can<00:02:48.560> avoid<00:02:48.920> a<00:02:49.220> catastrophic<00:02:49.519> failure<00:02:50.239> at

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
pin can avoid a catastrophic failure at

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.020 
pin can avoid a catastrophic failure at
a<00:02:50.660> very<00:02:51.049> very<00:02:51.410> affordable<00:02:51.829> cost<00:02:52.160> so<00:02:52.850> it's

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
a very very affordable cost so it's

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.780 
a very very affordable cost so it's
really<00:02:53.450> good<00:02:53.720> insurance<00:02:53.840> guys<00:02:54.380> so<00:02:55.250> in<00:02:55.400> closing

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
really good insurance guys so in closing

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.400 
really good insurance guys so in closing
again<00:02:55.970> it's<00:02:56.329> not<00:02:56.420> a<00:02:56.480> very<00:02:56.690> exciting<00:02:56.959> part<00:02:57.320> to

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
again it's not a very exciting part to

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.280 
again it's not a very exciting part to
talk<00:02:57.620> about<00:02:57.799> but<00:02:58.519> it's<00:02:58.790> a<00:02:59.060> very<00:02:59.600> affordable

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
talk about but it's a very affordable

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.289 
talk about but it's a very affordable
insurance<00:03:00.609> policy<00:03:01.609> for<00:03:01.880> your<00:03:01.940> forced

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
insurance policy for your forced

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:04.539 
insurance policy for your forced

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
inducted engine the running clearance

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:05.589 
inducted engine the running clearance
won't

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
won't

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.289 
won't
so<00:03:05.810> if<00:03:05.930> you're<00:03:06.049> gonna<00:03:06.140> target<00:03:06.650> around<00:03:06.739> a<00:03:06.950> sow

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
so if you're gonna target around a sow

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.670 
so if you're gonna target around a sow
four-piston<00:03:08.299> to<00:03:08.480> pin<00:03:08.659> clearance<00:03:09.140> it<00:03:09.379> doesn't

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
four-piston to pin clearance it doesn't

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.580 
four-piston to pin clearance it doesn't
change<00:03:09.860> with<00:03:10.189> a<00:03:10.220> thicker<00:03:11.150> pin<00:03:11.480> you<00:03:12.170> do<00:03:12.349> pick<00:03:12.560> up

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
change with a thicker pin you do pick up

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.890 
change with a thicker pin you do pick up
a<00:03:12.769> little<00:03:12.950> bit<00:03:13.129> of<00:03:13.250> weight<00:03:13.489> as<00:03:14.450> you<00:03:14.629> go<00:03:14.750> to<00:03:14.810> a

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
a little bit of weight as you go to a

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.220 
a little bit of weight as you go to a
thicker<00:03:15.200> pen<00:03:15.530> so<00:03:15.980> you<00:03:16.280> know<00:03:16.819> there's<00:03:17.030> a<00:03:17.090> 15<00:03:18.079> or

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
thicker pen so you know there's a 15 or

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.770 
thicker pen so you know there's a 15 or
18<00:03:18.319> gram<00:03:18.709> step<00:03:19.129> when<00:03:19.400> you<00:03:19.489> go<00:03:19.610> from<00:03:19.939> 200<00:03:20.360> to<00:03:20.689> a

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
18 gram step when you go from 200 to a

18 gram step when you go from 200 to a
250<00:03:21.470> now<00:03:22.010> that<00:03:22.730> mass<00:03:23.260> if<00:03:24.260> you're<00:03:24.530> overly

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069 
250 now that mass if you're overly

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:26.559 
250 now that mass if you're overly
concerned<00:03:25.459> about<00:03:25.609> that<00:03:25.909> mass<00:03:26.180> if<00:03:26.480> you're

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
concerned about that mass if you're

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.089 
concerned about that mass if you're
gonna<00:03:26.659> let<00:03:26.870> that<00:03:26.989> kind<00:03:27.140> of<00:03:27.230> drag<00:03:27.470> the<00:03:27.620> decision

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
gonna let that kind of drag the decision

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:31.179 
gonna let that kind of drag the decision
down<00:03:28.370> keep<00:03:29.090> in<00:03:29.239> mind<00:03:29.450> that<00:03:29.689> the<00:03:29.900> small<00:03:30.890> amount

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:31.189 
down keep in mind that the small amount

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:33.640 
down keep in mind that the small amount
of<00:03:31.310> weight<00:03:31.549> that<00:03:31.579> you're<00:03:31.909> gaining<00:03:32.209> in<00:03:32.659> the

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
of weight that you're gaining in the

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.970 
of weight that you're gaining in the
piston<00:03:34.069> pin<00:03:34.280> area<00:03:34.840> is<00:03:35.840> buying<00:03:36.200> a<00:03:36.349> tremendous

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
piston pin area is buying a tremendous

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.119 
piston pin area is buying a tremendous
amount<00:03:37.340> of<00:03:37.430> durability<00:03:38.090> for<00:03:38.299> the<00:03:38.420> engine<00:03:39.129> if

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:40.129 
amount of durability for the engine if

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:41.710 
amount of durability for the engine if
you<00:03:40.400> can<00:03:40.670> look<00:03:40.879> around<00:03:40.970> and<00:03:41.299> see<00:03:41.540> some

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
you can look around and see some

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.170 
you can look around and see some
failures<00:03:42.139> that<00:03:42.319> happen<00:03:42.500> when<00:03:42.859> pins<00:03:43.129> break<00:03:43.549> it

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
failures that happen when pins break it

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.970 
failures that happen when pins break it
becomes<00:03:44.480> very<00:03:44.720> obvious<00:03:44.810> that<00:03:45.379> it<00:03:45.530> is<00:03:45.590> money

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
becomes very obvious that it is money

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.220 
becomes very obvious that it is money
well<00:03:46.069> spent<00:03:46.220> to<00:03:46.760> buy<00:03:46.879> the<00:03:46.940> upgraded<00:03:47.480> pin<00:03:47.720> for
