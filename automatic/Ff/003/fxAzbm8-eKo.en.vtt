00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:14.390 
look to it but also it's part of my
suspension<00:03:09.769> so<00:03:10.769> I<00:03:11.569> mean<00:03:12.569> it's<00:03:13.440> super<00:03:14.250> nice

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
suspension so I mean it's super nice

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.060 
suspension so I mean it's super nice
helps<00:03:14.790> me<00:03:14.940> not<00:03:15.180> to<00:03:15.390> flip<00:03:15.600> over<00:03:15.780> I<00:03:16.140> am<00:03:16.950> and

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
helps me not to flip over I am and

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.650 
helps me not to flip over I am and
especially<00:03:20.070> with<00:03:20.220> having<00:03:20.579> the<00:03:20.820> VXL<00:03:21.299> on<00:03:21.450> there

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
especially with having the VXL on there

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.840 
especially with having the VXL on there
and<00:03:21.930> all<00:03:22.049> the<00:03:22.170> torque<00:03:22.530> I<00:03:22.829> can<00:03:22.950> hit<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.220> gaps<00:03:23.459> in

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
and all the torque I can hit the gaps in

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.319 
and all the torque I can hit the gaps in
the<00:03:24.390> front<00:03:24.660> end<00:03:24.840> can<00:03:24.989> pop<00:03:25.170> up<00:03:25.200> but<00:03:25.829> the<00:03:26.040> back<00:03:26.250> is

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
the front end can pop up but the back is

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:30.020 
the front end can pop up but the back is
completely<00:03:27.329> straight<00:03:27.600> and<00:03:28.610> I<00:03:29.610> could<00:03:29.760> be<00:03:29.880> going

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
completely straight and I could be going

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.850 
completely straight and I could be going
up<00:03:30.180> a<00:03:30.329> hill<00:03:30.510> crawling<00:03:31.049> over<00:03:31.170> a<00:03:31.350> rock<00:03:31.650> or

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
up a hill crawling over a rock or

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.310 
up a hill crawling over a rock or
something<00:03:32.360> front<00:03:33.360> end<00:03:33.540> could<00:03:33.690> be<00:03:33.840> pulled<00:03:34.110> up

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
something front end could be pulled up

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.560 
something front end could be pulled up
and<00:03:34.650> back<00:03:34.980> in<00:03:35.220> is<00:03:35.370> just<00:03:35.519> completely<00:03:36.120> like<00:03:36.299> that

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
and back in is just completely like that

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:42.410 
and back in is just completely like that
it's<00:03:37.470> nice<00:03:40.250> but<00:03:41.250> I<00:03:41.610> think<00:03:41.940> it<00:03:42.030> looks<00:03:42.209> sweet

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
it's nice but I think it looks sweet

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:48.380 
it's nice but I think it looks sweet
like<00:03:42.720> this<00:03:43.109> and<00:03:43.500> then<00:03:45.410> gets<00:03:46.410> awesome<00:03:46.680> flex<00:03:47.390> and

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
like this and then gets awesome flex and

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.569 
like this and then gets awesome flex and
if<00:03:49.049> you're<00:03:49.680> going<00:03:49.890> over<00:03:50.160> a<00:03:50.190> rock<00:03:50.400> or<00:03:50.549> something

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
if you're going over a rock or something

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:52.789 
if you're going over a rock or something
your<00:03:51.180> back<00:03:51.420> axle<00:03:51.810> drops<00:03:52.079> down<00:03:52.320> so<00:03:52.380> you<00:03:52.590> still

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
your back axle drops down so you still

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.949 
your back axle drops down so you still
get<00:03:52.950> traction<00:03:53.519> on<00:03:53.880> it

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
get traction on it

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:06.140 
get traction on it
oh<00:03:57.950> and<00:03:58.950> I<00:03:59.130> also<00:03:59.370> did<00:03:59.850> end<00:04:00.810> up<00:04:01.500> breaking<00:04:05.150> right

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
oh and I also did end up breaking right

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.849 
oh and I also did end up breaking right
up<00:04:06.480> and<00:04:07.200> focus<00:04:08.780> all<00:04:09.780> right<00:04:09.840> there<00:04:10.140> is<00:04:10.350> the

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
up and focus all right there is the

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:16.520 
up and focus all right there is the
plastic<00:04:11.670> piece<00:04:11.850> right<00:04:12.060> here<00:04:12.120> and<00:04:14.030> the<00:04:15.530> grub

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
plastic piece right here and the grub

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.580 
plastic piece right here and the grub
screw<00:04:16.560> went<00:04:17.039> in<00:04:17.190> and<00:04:17.459> locked<00:04:18.329> in<00:04:18.570> there<00:04:18.810> well<00:04:19.560> I

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
screw went in and locked in there well I

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.580 
screw went in and locked in there well I
hit<00:04:19.919> a<00:04:20.000> little<00:04:21.000> metal<00:04:21.359> post<00:04:21.810> at<00:04:22.019> night<00:04:22.260> and

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
hit a little metal post at night and

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.800 
hit a little metal post at night and
ended<00:04:23.550> up<00:04:23.669> breaking<00:04:23.909> this<00:04:24.180> whole<00:04:24.360> thing<00:04:24.630> out

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
ended up breaking this whole thing out

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.580 
ended up breaking this whole thing out
and<00:04:25.590> I<00:04:25.710> was<00:04:25.830> like<00:04:25.919> oh<00:04:26.039> I<00:04:26.070> gotta<00:04:26.580> get<00:04:26.789> a<00:04:26.820> new

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
and I was like oh I gotta get a new

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.820 
and I was like oh I gotta get a new
bottom<00:04:28.590> plate<00:04:29.520> but<00:04:29.970> ended<00:04:30.930> up<00:04:31.050> I<00:04:31.320> didn't<00:04:31.620> I

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
bottom plate but ended up I didn't I

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.550 
bottom plate but ended up I didn't I
just<00:04:31.890> shoved<00:04:32.550> a<00:04:32.790> another<00:04:33.630> grub<00:04:34.110> screw<00:04:34.380> in

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
just shoved a another grub screw in

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.170 
just shoved a another grub screw in
there<00:04:34.770> and<00:04:35.390> it<00:04:36.390> works<00:04:36.660> just<00:04:37.380> fine<00:04:37.530> now<00:04:37.910> but<00:04:38.910> I
