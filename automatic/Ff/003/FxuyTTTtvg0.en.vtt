media

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
media

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.979 
media
and<00:03:31.519> for<00:03:32.519> me<00:03:32.670> the<00:03:32.879> run-up<00:03:33.420> isn't<00:03:33.840> that

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
and for me the run-up isn't that

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.199 
and for me the run-up isn't that
important<00:03:34.620> so<00:03:34.829> you<00:03:34.890> can<00:03:35.040> choose<00:03:35.640> the<00:03:35.700> four

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
important so you can choose the four

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.399 
important so you can choose the four
step<00:03:36.510> 5<00:03:36.780> step<00:03:36.810> whatever<00:03:37.439> you<00:03:37.739> like<00:03:37.920> I<00:03:39.409> like

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:40.409 
step 5 step whatever you like I like

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:44.660 
step 5 step whatever you like I like
yeah<00:03:40.739> sure<00:03:41.069> I<00:03:42.709> hit<00:03:43.709> the<00:03:43.829> ball<00:03:44.040> that's

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
yeah sure I hit the ball that's

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.759 
yeah sure I hit the ball that's
important<00:03:45.390> for<00:03:45.510> me<00:03:45.569> and<00:03:45.959> a<00:03:46.319> bit<00:03:46.530> on<00:03:46.829> the<00:03:47.370> middle

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
important for me and a bit on the middle

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:53.180 
important for me and a bit on the middle
because<00:03:49.769> it<00:03:50.280> gets<00:03:51.120> a<00:03:51.329> bit<00:03:51.540> more<00:03:51.680> topspin<00:03:52.680> and

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
because it gets a bit more topspin and

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.339 
because it gets a bit more topspin and
going<00:03:53.519> over<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:53.790> walls<00:03:54.090> because<00:03:54.480> visit

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
going over the walls because visit

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:59.599 
going over the walls because visit
behind<00:03:55.950> it<00:03:56.370> stays<00:03:56.849> on<00:03:57.000> the<00:03:57.120> ground<00:03:57.150> okay<00:03:58.609> do

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
behind it stays on the ground okay do

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:03.050 
behind it stays on the ground okay do
your<00:04:00.599> standing<00:04:00.989> leg<00:04:01.019> is<00:04:01.439> about<00:04:02.189> maybe<00:04:02.760> ten

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
your standing leg is about maybe ten

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.430 
your standing leg is about maybe ten
centimeters<00:04:03.659> away<00:04:03.870> not<00:04:04.709> that<00:04:04.980> white<00:04:05.670> not<00:04:06.030> that

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
centimeters away not that white not that

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.430 
centimeters away not that white not that
because<00:04:07.440> it's<00:04:08.389> yeah<00:04:09.389> bit<00:04:09.629> closer<00:04:09.870> and<00:04:10.260> it's

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
because it's yeah bit closer and it's

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.720 
because it's yeah bit closer and it's
easier<00:04:10.920> to<00:04:10.950> do<00:04:11.370> the<00:04:11.579> technique<00:04:12.209> you<00:04:12.389> know<00:04:12.540> with

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
easier to do the technique you know with

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.400 
easier to do the technique you know with
yeah<00:04:14.730> yeah<00:04:15.000> it's<00:04:15.329> a<00:04:15.420> bit<00:04:15.540> easier<00:04:15.870> for<00:04:15.900> me

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
yeah yeah it's a bit easier for me

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.590 
yeah yeah it's a bit easier for me
you<00:04:16.799> should<00:04:17.010> just<00:04:17.220> practice<00:04:17.489> and<00:04:17.940> if<00:04:18.359> it's

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
you should just practice and if it's

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.599 
you should just practice and if it's
easier<00:04:18.900> for<00:04:18.959> you<00:04:19.199> to<00:04:19.229> have<00:04:19.650> a<00:04:19.680> bit<00:04:19.949> wider<00:04:20.220> way

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
easier for you to have a bit wider way

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.250 
easier for you to have a bit wider way
so<00:04:21.060> it's<00:04:21.449> up<00:04:21.570> to<00:04:21.600> you<00:04:23.240> yeah<00:04:24.240> this<00:04:24.539> part<00:04:24.810> we'll

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
so it's up to you yeah this part we'll

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.070 
so it's up to you yeah this part we'll
just<00:04:25.500> like<00:04:25.680> a<00:04:25.889> mix<00:04:26.130> of<00:04:26.370> the<00:04:26.550> inside<00:04:27.000> and<00:04:27.330> the

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
just like a mix of the inside and the

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.129 
just like a mix of the inside and the
instep<00:04:28.650> I<00:04:28.889> would<00:04:29.430> you<00:04:30.090> can<00:04:30.120> also<00:04:30.449> hit<00:04:30.810> it<00:04:30.960> with

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 
instep I would you can also hit it with

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.650 
instep I would you can also hit it with
your<00:04:31.350> laces<00:04:31.560> but<00:04:32.070> I<00:04:32.280> recommend<00:04:32.639> to<00:04:33.060> use<00:04:33.330> this

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
your laces but I recommend to use this

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.960 
your laces but I recommend to use this
one<00:04:33.960> because<00:04:33.990> it's<00:04:34.560> the<00:04:34.680> hardest<00:04:34.860> part<00:04:35.760> of

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
one because it's the hardest part of

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.540 
one because it's the hardest part of
your<00:04:36.000> foot<00:04:36.389> okay<00:04:37.139> yeah<00:04:37.470> yeah<00:04:37.680> like<00:04:37.919> this<00:04:38.370> is

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
your foot okay yeah yeah like this is

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:44.300 
your foot okay yeah yeah like this is
also<00:04:38.970> the<00:04:39.599> point<00:04:40.229> where<00:04:40.590> somehow<00:04:41.220> they<00:04:43.070> get<00:04:44.070> a

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
also the point where somehow they get a

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.580 
also the point where somehow they get a
lot<00:04:44.460> of<00:04:44.520> power<00:04:44.880> there<00:04:45.030> but<00:04:45.479> yeah<00:04:45.690> you<00:04:46.349> just

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
lot of power there but yeah you just

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.890 
lot of power there but yeah you just
create<00:04:46.979> the<00:04:47.160> most<00:04:47.310> power<00:04:47.699> with<00:04:47.970> this<00:04:48.150> part<00:04:48.720> of

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900
