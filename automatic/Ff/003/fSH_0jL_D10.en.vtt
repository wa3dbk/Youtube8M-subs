perspective<00:03:15.870> on<00:03:15.960> a<00:03:15.990> few<00:03:16.260> of<00:03:16.350> these<00:03:16.440> questions

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
perspective on a few of these questions

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.450 
perspective on a few of these questions
the<00:03:17.520> first<00:03:17.670> question<00:03:17.820> is<00:03:18.300> the<00:03:18.960> Evo<00:03:19.410> has<00:03:19.680> a<00:03:19.980> fan

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:20.460 
the first question is the Evo has a fan

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.760 
the first question is the Evo has a fan
spray<00:03:21.000> versus<00:03:21.570> a<00:03:21.600> regular<00:03:21.810> conical<00:03:22.500> spray

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
spray versus a regular conical spray

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.880 
spray versus a regular conical spray
from<00:03:23.490> a<00:03:23.790> food<00:03:24.300> preparation<00:03:24.660> standpoint<00:03:25.590> how

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
from a food preparation standpoint how

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.120 
from a food preparation standpoint how
is<00:03:26.100> the<00:03:26.220> fan<00:03:26.460> spray<00:03:27.080> output<00:03:28.080> better<00:03:28.650> than<00:03:29.100> a

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
is the fan spray output better than a

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.100 
is the fan spray output better than a
conical<00:03:29.580> spray<00:03:29.820> output<00:03:30.150> well<00:03:30.540> a<00:03:30.600> conical

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
conical spray output well a conical

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.190 
conical spray output well a conical
spray<00:03:31.380> limits<00:03:31.860> you<00:03:32.010> to<00:03:32.280> a<00:03:32.660> circumference<00:03:33.660> area

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
spray limits you to a circumference area

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.380 
spray limits you to a circumference area
and<00:03:34.440> most<00:03:34.710> of<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:34.980> pans<00:03:35.280> that<00:03:35.460> we<00:03:35.580> use<00:03:35.970> in<00:03:36.270> our

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
and most of the pans that we use in our

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.410 
and most of the pans that we use in our
home<00:03:37.080> cooking<00:03:37.620> would<00:03:38.280> will<00:03:38.610> have<00:03:39.000> more<00:03:39.270> of<00:03:39.330> a

home cooking would will have more of a

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
in the Evo bottle so that I don't have

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.400
