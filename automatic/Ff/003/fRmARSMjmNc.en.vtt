00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.439
 with the touch we back to our 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.240
 new video review more we can do 

00:00:04.439 --> 00:00:09.059
 a review of the figure of spider-man 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.970
 2 of the spider-man movie so 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.890
 let's continue to see the packaging 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.049
 before starting a big greeting to all 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.420
 and let's start by looking at the box of the figure 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.780
 we see marvel in this amazing spider-man 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.630
 4 and we see that it comes with the hand depends 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.970
 green and a flame of fire and two pairs 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.689
 from failing hand on the part of 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.129
 back we see a picture of spider-man in 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.800
 one of its spectacular ones is 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:37.679
 arachnids we see that here we see that 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.180
 says mobility figures collection 

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:42.400
 global train collection 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.720
 these are the figures for each of 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.470
 the figures comes a part of the great 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.690
 balloon to assemble washes and before everything 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.550
 I wanted to start by saying that this video 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.160
 revision or this revision is at the request of 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.830
 a subscriber of the collective so it's 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.500
 something for him in the channel create 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:03.580
 collections but also good videos 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.890
 about marvel figures and also about 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.900
 minecraft gameplay so it's region 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.390
 on your channel and we start with this 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.450
 revision but now we see that part 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.640
 of seven amazing spider-man 2 and by the 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.590
 part above an image of the spider 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.300
 of spider-man warning danger of 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.330
 Choking small parts is not for children 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:25.479
 under 3 years my engadget are in 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.850
 english link loving and that are for 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.440
 older than 4 years and three years now 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.210
 on the back of this part of 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.940
 here to move an excellent art or 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.100
 drawing of what the figure would be in a 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.870
 spectacular arachnids fossils and now 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.700
 let's continue with the figure 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:46.550
 the figure as such cost me around 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.890
 $ 30 more or less and right now your 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.270
 price has gone up a bit more so 30 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.210
 dollars is the fair price for the 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.500
 strong figure the figure we are going to start 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.620
 with the stadium has an excellent 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.000
 detail the lines that look like they 're 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.850
 made with a pen or pencil 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.060
 so they are well sculpted it feels 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.830
 the texture of the figure likewise those 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.890
 shades of blue color that seems 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.260
 as if it had texture is excellent it 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.000
 feels the texture of genius equally in 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.820
 the back we see the red spider of 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.500
 the figure looks excellent and spider 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.210
 black on the chest oil the figure of the 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.470
 salt issue if we see it this way it 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.210
 excels 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.400
 They have done a great job with the 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.430
 joints since if you know 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.230
 these figures here are more to put 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.380
 the wives without dynamics of action of 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.730
 the very figure of the face the eyes 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.790
 flat is a bit big but they are 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.569
 great we can do others and compose 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.670
 other music 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.650
 we continue with the figure of the 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.569
 points of articulation as such the 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.010
 figure as a point of articulation moves 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.909
 head 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:55.390
 360 degrees completely up 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:58.689
 quite down can also look 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.250
 problem completely and just like the 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:03.489
 head the arms that turn me the three 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.890
 180 degrees this arm rotates' the 180 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.209
 degrees and has butterflies joint 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.849
 active I will choose backwards and for 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.040
 go ahead and also have a 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:15.760
 upward articulation that can be 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:18.430
 arm both arms up 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.280
 you can also turn the vice 360 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.810
 degrees on the two arms sides and one 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.170
 joint double point of articulation 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.239
 in the arm very good joint 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:32.500
 allows the figure to do this 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:35.470
 type of attack of a blow normally 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.200
 the figure has articulation in the hand 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:41.620
 360 degrees and it does up and for 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.940
 down also that they believe that in the 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.489
 waist also has two point 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.680
 articulation in the thorax part by 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.680
 the chest part with the waist in the 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.510
 union down and up 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.849
 excellent articulation applied for a 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.720
 figure manuel laws articulation physics 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:04:00.090
 at the waist 360 degrees 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.730
 and in the part of the foot can lift 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.040
 up to this point and double point of 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:08.580
 joint in the knee completely 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.230
 a 360 Â° foot joint as already 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.390
 they imagined it and a joint 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.850
 small on the foot up and towards 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.620
 front or back that is forward and 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.109
 you have the joint that makes the 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.090
 figure of the foot the part of the foot and between 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:24.460
 180 degrees to put them in poses 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:27.479
 dynamics like what would be 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.479
 and figure 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.129
 and if we look like a positioning 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.639
 Then he wants to have a blow 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:34.639
 yes 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.169
 but let's see the figure and with the 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.110
 interchangeable hands so there we 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:44.180
 we see 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.320
 and now as we can see it comes with a 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.720
 arm from inside bing 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.180
 this arm only has articulation 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.640
 of down and up in double 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:58.270
 point of the situation in the elbow 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:05:01.030
 articulation in the arm and up and 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:04.980
 down and articulation account has 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:09.160
 the arm 300 360 degrees and up and 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:12.520
 down also so it's a very 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.770
 good figure to wash juice from an arm 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.120
 of articulation with a lot of 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.730
 articulation so let's continue 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:22.380
 with the flame of fire or the flame of 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:25.780
 fire from a soft plastic this gp 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:28.810
 so it's very good very good accessory 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:31.600
 for the figure of the big globe and apart 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:34.000
 who believe comes apart with that arm 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.980
 come also imagine with two hands 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.810
 more for the figure this is something 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.570
 excellent have applied marvel laws of 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:44.020
 hasbro for figures on a scale of 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:45.460
 marvel characters so how do you 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.540
 they imagined already came with their peers 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:50.410
 hand 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:52.440
 and now let's put another one for 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:56.800
 keep seeing that the vision that 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:58.360
 continuing with the review we are going to 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.490
 put the human hands 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:03.580
 interchangeable to the figure this is of 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:06.939
 easy just pull and 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.169
 they place the hand of their preference that 

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:12.280
 is the hand doing lateral to the 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:15.009
 I just put cobweb and have to 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:18.030
 be with your hand so we put the 

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:20.190
 another in the other hand 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:23.520
 I have seen and I have seen that it gives you the figure 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:25.520
 the cobweb if you want to put a 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.840
 dynamic pose there 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:31.090
 Now let's do a little 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.090
 comparison with surmountable bread 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.880
 now if we see the figure of the doctor 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:43.700
 octopus and the figure of spider-man 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:47.580
 articulable can put here the figure and 

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:50.280
 we see that the sizes figure of 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:52.530
 the possible pro is higher than the figure 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:55.379
 from marvel legends so it's from 

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:57.120
 figuretis wins and of course the doctor 

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:59.639
 octopus is on average failing 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.229
 command of the movie but it 's isolated 

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:04.080
 figures are excellent I recommend 

00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:06.270
 all three of these spider-man figures 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.669
 the two and I recommend the other one 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:11.099
 possibly good news that they believe 

00:07:08.669 --> 00:07:12.090
 that are going to when you left behind new 

00:07:11.099 --> 00:07:13.830
 dices 

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:16.199
 the good news that this trophy 

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:19.039
 can have a vision and I hope that they 

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:19.039
 like the video that I'm going to upload 

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.100
 nothing would be all this thanks for watching 

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:25.230
 the sales video and thanks because in 

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:30.410
 the good video I am a collector 

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:33.330
 marvel and he said goodbye saying goodbye 

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:35.540
 and if you want to see actions like these in 

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.540
 full hd 

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.939
 and I teach the figures subscribe if 

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:40.289
 disquerÃ­a soon have new 

00:07:38.939 --> 00:07:43.080
 decisions of figures will come 

00:07:40.289 --> 00:07:47.150
 figures and new visions and that was it 

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:47.150
 the video and cha cha cha cha cha cha cha
