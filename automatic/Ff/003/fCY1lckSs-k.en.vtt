00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.819
 the truth that one of the things more 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.680
 nice things in life is to learn 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.599
 learn things out there today not 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.580
 let's exercise we're never going to 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.150
 never do but the simple fact of 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.910
 know what is important in the case of 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.130
 this abstract art by nancy towers 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.590
 also explained what do you think if we 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.480
 we go to your third and we see it and the 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.420
 we hear 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.130
 go ahead please good morning how 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.320
 are you I hope you are all very 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.000
 well today we are going to work a table with 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.770
 complementary colors we will work 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.570
 the orange and blue complements 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.949
 to make both contrast is 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.930
 complement well the two call the 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:41.879
 attention again we are going to make use of the 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.280
 rhythm of the similarity of forms 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.839
 geometric and from a well-moved background the 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.510
 background in this case we're going to work with 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:51.269
 brush &amp; wide with the white colors of 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.829
 titanium and a pinch of just orange if 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:54.839
 they do not have orange they can do it with 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.820
 land of natural wax that also them 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:59.460
 It gives a lot to orange remember that 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.920
 the lands are formed by mixing the three 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.780
 primary blue red and yellow how much 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.759
 more amount of yellow has we go 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.710
 more to fill them the more red we go 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:09.720
 more to the toasted ones and the more blue 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.479
 we go more to the shadows then the subject 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.180
 of today color the background we are going to give 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.160
 vertical brush strokes in a critical 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.159
 white in exchange brush is a bit 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.289
 dirty from the previous picture 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.380
 it will not be a problem because if they see in the 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:28.710
 original then they have to be made by 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.689
 strokes but how is acrylic in 20 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.609
 minutes is covered to me sometimes I 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.469
 like to teach them what happens in this 

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:36.179
 kind of involuntary errors and 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:37.380
 teach them how to solve the error because 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:39.060
 most likely it is that when one is 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.859
 with my own and things come out but 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.659
 As you are alone at home, be wrong and 

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:44.670
 part of the learning and part of the 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.719
 teaching is also that to teach to 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.959
 solve the errors 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:51.539
 we leave the eta brush in the water and go 

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:54.509
 to our dear spatula as always 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:57.719
 not with what colors we are going to take the blue 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.579
 ultramarine blue cerulean red oxide and 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.379
 of course we use the orange and 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.929
 the white well then we work the 

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:05.250
 complementary land and white 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:06.750
 let's take first the darkest 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.149
 remember that I always do 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.160
 start by the dark tones to 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.530
 achieve contrast we stop with the 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.440
 spatula and we went down forming this species 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.810
 of bucket with the same spatula we already do 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.549
 these verticals are the ones that I 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.200
 I said do not worry about the background 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.970
 because it gives the idea that those are 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.780
 further back and these are in a more plane 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.150
 next 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.500
 If this is white, let's go 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.600
 playing with the tonalities of the 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.730
 Look how beautiful turquoise blue 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.560
 we started to achieve as seen in the box 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.300
 original that you are going to see a lot 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.430
 of blue and turquoise varieties 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:43.860
 see how nice when we put the red 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:46.500
 oxide we incorporate a blue earth 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.360
 the number of colors that start at 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.700
 form when working wet acrylic 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.200
 is melting tone on tone and that's 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.300
 what makes the color is not left 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.370
 of the direct smoke and is giving all this 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.470
 Chromatic range, look, I'm going to put a 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.640
 little more rust on this bit 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.070
 always movement is the same 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.170
 horizontal and I hang it horizontally and the 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.600
 I hang up and notice that we are giving plans 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.420
 further away and closer to this species 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.220
 of geometric media cubes we have 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.610
 then the subject of the fund we have the 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.680
 blue we have the oxides we are going now to 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.209
 put the orange as a complement to 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.250
 this tone in the same way that I 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.170
 I have been doing here and we are doing the same 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.390
 some cube in orange 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.310
 if they want some higher and they are playing 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.760
 with this appearance of colors that are 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.709
 is giving we also take a little bit of 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.540
 yellow gold just a pinch of 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.300
 yellow gold to illuminate in some 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.820
 sectors I always advise you that 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.200
 illuminate in some sector with yellow 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.700
 with the white look at the picture 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.080
 original that is not that is all the 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.930
 yellow box but in some sector 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.840
 those little touches of yellow those 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.690
 small lights 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.790
 in a lot little touches and for 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:56.670
 last what I would like you to do that 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:59.580
 it gives some weirder effect more 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.110
 striking is to take a comb any 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.739
 comb that you have in your house a 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.239
 old comb that I had here and that 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.459
 they do as the paint is wet from 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.890
 many layers of acrylics on the 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.630
 another in some sector supports on the edge 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.150
 cited the comb and make this move 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.950
 curved and simulate as if it were a 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.079
 kind of balconies in that kind of 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.820
 city ​​in that city profile some 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.040
 can do curved others can 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.070
 do straight and others can do a 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.440
 movement that goes down an oblique one 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.540
 straight and an oblique and see how they give van 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.580
 giving another kind of movement with the 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.280
 same singing comb can go up 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.110
 still more masts and lower more 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.180
 masts then it is giving more rhythm to 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.340
 the composition in this way go 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.290
 forming all that scale of blocks with 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.150
 so much rhythm and with so much contrast in the 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.860
 complementary colors well I hope that 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.050
 It has been useful for them to practice a little 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.729
 put together the red with having blue a have 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.680
 yellow, see what happens when they put 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:54.060
 a little more red that happens when you 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.190
 they put a little more yellow and what happened 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.020
 to put a little 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.670
 and start working with the theory of 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.270
 color to not always be depending 

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:03.680
 of tone vomit to work good 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.520
 I hope you served them we'll see you in 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.520
