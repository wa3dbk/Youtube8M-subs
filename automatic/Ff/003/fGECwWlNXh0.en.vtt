trodden path of mud because that just

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.350 
trodden path of mud because that just
looks<00:00:48.530> now<00:00:48.770> it<00:00:48.920> gets<00:00:49.130> rubbish<00:00:49.820> on<00:00:49.970> your<00:00:50.120> shoes

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
to allow access to climb over and then

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.850

because they just grow back so what

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:27.430 
because they just grow back so what
we've<00:01:26.060> done<00:01:26.240> is<00:01:26.510> we've<00:01:26.659> made<00:01:26.810> sure<00:01:26.870> that<00:01:27.140> the

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
we've done is we've made sure that the

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.370 
we've done is we've made sure that the
intersection<00:01:28.100> is<00:01:28.520> weed<00:01:28.970> free<00:01:29.390> which<00:01:30.200> it

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
intersection is weed free which it

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.660 
intersection is weed free which it
pretty<00:01:30.590> much<00:01:30.770> was<00:01:31.040> when<00:01:31.250> we<00:01:31.340> finished

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
pretty much was when we finished

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.640 
pretty much was when we finished
construction<00:01:32.090> and<00:01:32.720> we've<00:01:32.869> just<00:01:32.900> carefully

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
construction and we've just carefully

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.510 
construction and we've just carefully
spread<00:01:33.979> out<00:01:34.420> four<00:01:35.420> big<00:01:35.840> bags<00:01:36.170> of<00:01:36.680> this<00:01:37.100> chipped

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
spread out four big bags of this chipped

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.940 
spread out four big bags of this chipped
wood<00:01:37.940> bark<00:01:38.299> and<00:01:38.630> it's<00:01:39.049> a<00:01:39.080> lovely<00:01:39.260> smell<00:01:39.710> too

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
wood bark and it's a lovely smell too

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.010 
wood bark and it's a lovely smell too
especially<00:01:40.190> when<00:01:40.490> it<00:01:40.610> gets<00:01:40.640> warm<00:01:41.090> but<00:01:41.720> this<00:01:41.869> is

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
especially when it gets warm but this is

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.630 
especially when it gets warm but this is
much<00:01:42.200> better<00:01:42.409> for<00:01:42.560> walking<00:01:43.070> on<00:01:43.130> than<00:01:43.340> the<00:01:43.460> bare

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
much better for walking on than the bare

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.750 
much better for walking on than the bare
earth<00:01:43.670> and<00:01:44.240> hopefully<00:01:45.049> as<00:01:45.140> well<00:01:45.350> the<00:01:45.560> other

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
earth and hopefully as well the other

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.070 
earth and hopefully as well the other
added<00:01:46.760> benefit<00:01:47.210> of<00:01:47.240> this<00:01:47.420> apart<00:01:47.750> from<00:01:47.900> they

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
added benefit of this apart from they

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.350 
added benefit of this apart from they
suppress<00:01:48.439> in<00:01:48.560> the<00:01:48.650> weed<00:01:48.799> growth<00:01:49.100> is<00:01:49.400> it<00:01:50.180> means

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
suppress in the weed growth is it means

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.450 
suppress in the weed growth is it means
that<00:01:50.540> everything<00:01:50.810> looks<00:01:51.200> so<00:01:51.799> much<00:01:51.979> neater<00:01:52.280> and

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
that everything looks so much neater and

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.560 
that everything looks so much neater and
you're<00:01:52.640> not<00:01:52.729> going<00:01:52.909> to<00:01:52.970> get<00:01:53.060> as<00:01:53.150> much<00:01:53.299> water

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
you're not going to get as much water

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.480 
you're not going to get as much water
splashing<00:01:54.290> up<00:01:54.409> when<00:01:54.590> it<00:01:54.680> rains<00:01:54.920> when<00:01:55.250> it<00:01:55.310> hits

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
splashing up when it rains when it hits

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.010 
splashing up when it rains when it hits
the<00:01:55.670> ground<00:01:55.700> and<00:01:56.000> bounces<00:01:56.060> up<00:01:56.540> right<00:01:56.840> so<00:01:56.930> we're

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
the ground and bounces up right so we're

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
going to go and take a look at some of

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.289 
going to go and take a look at some of
these<00:01:58.310> stairs<00:01:58.670> I'm<00:01:58.880> going<00:01:59.000> to<00:01:59.060> talk<00:01:59.270> you

these stairs I'm going to talk you

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:00.789 
these stairs I'm going to talk you
through<00:01:59.509> their<00:01:59.900> construction<00:02:00.470> I'm<00:02:00.560> just

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
through their construction I'm just

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.469 
through their construction I'm just
gonna<00:02:00.920> have<00:02:01.009> a<00:02:01.100> look<00:02:01.250> as<00:02:01.430> well<00:02:01.610> at<00:02:01.909> how<00:02:02.119> to<00:02:02.180> chip

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
gonna have a look as well at how to chip

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.380 
gonna have a look as well at how to chip
boundbox<00:02:02.900> well<00:02:03.890> we've<00:02:04.009> got<00:02:04.220> here<00:02:04.580> the<00:02:05.210> main

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
boundbox well we've got here the main

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.510 
boundbox well we've got here the main
set<00:02:05.659> of<00:02:05.780> steps<00:02:06.049> that<00:02:06.200> I've<00:02:06.439> built<00:02:06.650> and<00:02:07.310> we<00:02:07.400> did

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
set of steps that I've built and we did

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.699 
set of steps that I've built and we did
this<00:02:07.640> we<00:02:07.820> dug<00:02:08.090> out<00:02:08.269> this<00:02:08.479> whole<00:02:08.750> area<00:02:09.349> which

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
this we dug out this whole area which

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.319 
this we dug out this whole area which
was<00:02:09.830> quite<00:02:10.039> easy<00:02:10.250> with<00:02:10.549> the<00:02:10.670> soil<00:02:10.939> structure

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:11.329 
was quite easy with the soil structure

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:13.660 
was quite easy with the soil structure
that<00:02:11.510> we've<00:02:11.629> got<00:02:11.780> in<00:02:11.870> this<00:02:12.019> garden<00:02:12.549> but<00:02:13.549> then

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
that we've got in this garden but then

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.420 
that we've got in this garden but then
we've<00:02:13.849> back<00:02:14.090> filled<00:02:14.510> with<00:02:15.200> concrete<00:02:16.010> after

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
we've back filled with concrete after

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.160 
we've back filled with concrete after
having<00:02:16.819> said<00:02:17.060> I<00:02:17.090> had<00:02:17.329> all<00:02:17.480> of<00:02:17.510> these<00:02:17.750> roofing

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
having said I had all of these roofing

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.500 
having said I had all of these roofing
tiles<00:02:18.500> so<00:02:18.829> I've<00:02:18.950> set<00:02:19.189> one<00:02:19.370> of<00:02:19.489> these<00:02:19.640> in<00:02:19.939> to

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
tiles so I've set one of these in to

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.449 
tiles so I've set one of these in to
hold<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:20.930> upper<00:02:21.200> step<00:02:21.409> lock<00:02:21.680> and<00:02:22.040> I've<00:02:22.280> used

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
hold the upper step lock and I've used

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.550 
hold the upper step lock and I've used
some<00:02:22.760> spare<00:02:23.120> block<00:02:23.510> paving<00:02:23.810> which

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
some spare block paving which

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.699 
some spare block paving which
concreted<00:02:25.400> in<00:02:25.630> on<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:26.840> top<00:02:27.110> and<00:02:27.349> that<00:02:27.470> gives

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
concreted in on the top and that gives

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.520 
concreted in on the top and that gives
us<00:02:27.830> two<00:02:28.130> good<00:02:28.489> steps<00:02:28.910> to<00:02:29.569> stand<00:02:29.870> on<00:02:30.170> to<00:02:30.349> then

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
us two good steps to stand on to then

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.400 
us two good steps to stand on to then
climb<00:02:30.890> over<00:02:31.130> the<00:02:31.880> actual<00:02:32.209> structure<00:02:32.900> and<00:02:33.290> we

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
climb over the actual structure and we

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.729 
climb over the actual structure and we
can<00:02:33.560> also<00:02:33.709> see<00:02:34.069> how<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:34.760> chips<00:02:35.510> would<00:02:36.440> bark

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
can also see how the chips would bark

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.030 
can also see how the chips would bark
has<00:02:37.540> covered<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.660> slope<00:02:38.989> and<00:02:39.620> made<00:02:39.770> it<00:02:39.890> nice

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
has covered the slope and made it nice

has covered the slope and made it nice
and<00:02:40.069> Li<00:02:40.400> and<00:02:40.580> covered<00:02:40.880> up<00:02:40.940> and<00:02:41.120> around<00:02:41.390> the

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
and Li and covered up and around the

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.040 
and Li and covered up and around the
steps<00:02:41.930> any<00:02:42.650> mess<00:02:43.040> where<00:02:43.430> the<00:02:43.819> steps<00:02:44.150> were<00:02:44.780> cut

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
covered up by that and then we can see

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:58.000 
covered up by that and then we can see
that<00:02:50.500> this<00:02:51.500> now<00:02:51.769> allows<00:02:51.950> easy<00:02:52.880> access<00:02:56.860> what<00:02:57.860> we
