you<00:04:43.050> know<00:04:43.229> Anna<00:04:43.410> told<00:04:43.740> me<00:04:43.800> in<00:04:43.889> the<00:04:43.979> past

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
you know Anna told me in the past

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.950 
you know Anna told me in the past
apparently<00:04:44.760> at<00:04:44.850> least<00:04:45.030> I<00:04:45.180> spoke<00:04:45.389> quite<00:04:45.660> a<00:04:45.690> bit

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
apparently at least I spoke quite a bit

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:52.430 
apparently at least I spoke quite a bit
from<00:04:46.169> a<00:04:46.260> good<00:04:47.220> of<00:04:47.340> war<00:04:47.580> I<00:04:47.850> suppose<00:04:48.539> so<00:04:51.440> the

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
from a good of war I suppose so the

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.320 
from a good of war I suppose so the
weakness<00:04:52.830> here<00:04:53.070> the<00:04:53.190> main<00:04:53.370> weiners<00:04:53.789> is<00:04:54.150> the

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
weakness here the main weiners is the

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.909 
weakness here the main weiners is the
fact<00:04:54.539> that<00:04:54.570> he's<00:04:54.840> opened<00:04:55.260> up<00:04:55.349> the<00:04:55.440> front<00:04:55.590> port

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 
fact that he's opened up the front port

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:58.909 
fact that he's opened up the front port
thus<00:04:56.220> revealing<00:04:56.700> the<00:04:56.970> weakness<00:04:57.419> no<00:04:58.200> it's<00:04:58.349> late

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
thus revealing the weakness no it's late

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.640 
thus revealing the weakness no it's late

I<00:05:02.160> think<00:05:02.580> not

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
I think not

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.839 
I think not
this<00:05:04.169> is<00:05:04.320> more<00:05:04.500> stupid<00:05:04.830> than<00:05:05.070> his<00:05:05.340> idea<00:05:05.669> for

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:05.849 
this is more stupid than his idea for

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:07.760 
this is more stupid than his idea for
the<00:05:05.910> egg<00:05:06.060> golem<00:05:06.389> yeah<00:05:06.960> Pope<00:05:07.380> put<00:05:07.530> the<00:05:07.650> weak
