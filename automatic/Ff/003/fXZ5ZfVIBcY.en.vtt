LLC now when I opened up this game I

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.900 
LLC now when I opened up this game I
thought<00:00:09.809> I<00:00:10.050> was<00:00:10.080> not<00:00:10.469> in<00:00:10.740> for<00:00:11.070> a<00:00:11.130> treat<00:00:11.519> but

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
thought I was not in for a treat but

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.940 
thought I was not in for a treat but
fortunately<00:00:12.420> it<00:00:12.719> managed<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.320> surprise<00:00:13.590> me

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
fortunately it managed to surprise me

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.499 
fortunately it managed to surprise me
now<00:00:14.549> I'm<00:00:14.610> not<00:00:14.670> sure<00:00:14.849> it's<00:00:15.150> going<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.360> be<00:00:15.480> a

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
now I'm not sure it's going to be a

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.939 
now I'm not sure it's going to be a
short<00:00:15.599> viewer<00:00:16.109> longer<00:00:16.500> because<00:00:16.800> there's

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
short viewer longer because there's

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.740 
short viewer longer because there's
actually<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.400> lot<00:00:17.490> to<00:00:17.880> explain<00:00:18.270> about<00:00:18.539> this

areas<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.220> your<00:01:50.340> capital<00:01:51.079> so<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.140> can<00:01:52.369> you<00:01:53.369> can

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
areas of your capital so you can you can

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.280 
areas of your capital so you can you can
see<00:01:53.759> how<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.000> basically<00:01:54.420> goes<00:01:54.689> back<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.229> forth

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
see how it basically goes back and forth

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.859 
see how it basically goes back and forth
between<00:01:55.649> capital<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.250> towns<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.880> other<00:01:57.659> than

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
between capital and towns and other than

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.539 
between capital and towns and other than
that<00:01:57.990> there<00:01:58.200> are<00:01:58.380> different<00:01:58.799> types<00:01:58.829> of<00:01:59.250> towns

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
that there are different types of towns

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.389 
that there are different types of towns
there<00:02:00.329> is<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.600> town<00:02:00.960> with<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.200> giant<00:02:01.500> one<00:02:01.829> pool<00:02:02.219> in

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
there is a town with a giant one pool in

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.679 
there is a town with a giant one pool in
the<00:02:02.490> middle<00:02:02.520> there's<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:02.969> town<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.270> is

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
the middle there's a town that is

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.050 
the middle there's a town that is
completely<00:02:04.590> dangerous<00:02:04.890> lots<00:02:05.399> of<00:02:05.549> bears<00:02:05.759> all

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
completely dangerous lots of bears all

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.700 
completely dangerous lots of bears all
the<00:02:06.240> time<00:02:06.450> there's<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.750> town<00:02:06.960> with<00:02:07.140> no<00:02:07.409> bears

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
the time there's a town with no bears

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.490 
the time there's a town with no bears
there's<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.670> regular<00:02:09.090> town<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.629> I<00:02:10.110> think

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
there's the regular town and I think

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.380 
there's the regular town and I think
that's<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:11.250> other<00:02:11.400> areas<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.910> tutorial

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
that's it the other areas the tutorial

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.020 
that's it the other areas the tutorial
area

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
area

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.330 
area
so<00:02:13.780> that's<00:02:14.020> basically<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.530> game<00:02:14.860> but<00:02:15.130> it's

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
so that's basically the game but it's

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.850 
so that's basically the game but it's
incredibly<00:02:15.910> addictive<00:02:16.450> and<00:02:16.630> it<00:02:16.930> has<00:02:17.110> built<00:02:17.650> in

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
incredibly addictive and it has built in

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.190 
incredibly addictive and it has built in
game<00:02:18.220> timer<00:02:18.670> so<00:02:19.330> you<00:02:19.360> can't<00:02:19.720> end<00:02:19.900> up<00:02:19.990> playing

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
game timer so you can't end up playing

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.620 
game timer so you can't end up playing
way<00:02:20.380> too<00:02:20.410> much<00:02:20.740> if<00:02:21.160> you<00:02:21.670> look<00:02:21.850> at<00:02:22.000> my<00:02:22.180> farms

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
way too much if you look at my farms

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.960 
way too much if you look at my farms
it'll<00:02:23.230> all<00:02:23.380> say<00:02:23.590> you<00:02:23.980> can<00:02:24.160> harvest<00:02:24.400> again<00:02:24.790> in

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
it'll all say you can harvest again in

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.670 
it'll all say you can harvest again in
five<00:02:25.209> hours<00:02:25.420> you<00:02:25.690> can<00:02:25.810> harvest<00:02:25.990> again<00:02:26.380> in<00:02:26.560> an

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
five hours you can harvest again in an

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.370 
five hours you can harvest again in an
hour<00:02:26.830> and<00:02:27.100> a<00:02:27.130> half<00:02:27.340> so<00:02:28.050> basically<00:02:29.050> you<00:02:29.200> can

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
hour and a half so basically you can

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.010 
hour and a half so basically you can
keep<00:02:29.590> playing<00:02:29.770> the<00:02:30.040> game<00:02:30.069> ad<00:02:30.459> infinitum<00:02:31.020> but

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
keep playing the game ad infinitum but

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.170 
keep playing the game ad infinitum but
you<00:02:32.440> will<00:02:32.680> be<00:02:32.830> better<00:02:33.040> off<00:02:33.130> if<00:02:33.550> you<00:02:33.790> wait<00:02:34.000> for

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
you will be better off if you wait for

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.910 
you will be better off if you wait for
some<00:02:34.330> time<00:02:34.510> so<00:02:34.720> you<00:02:34.810> get<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.080> special<00:02:35.440> rewards

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
some time so you get the special rewards

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.350 
some time so you get the special rewards
from<00:02:36.069> your<00:02:36.280> farms<00:02:36.640> and<00:02:36.730> your<00:02:36.819> military

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
from your farms and your military

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.780 
from your farms and your military
academies<00:02:37.930> as<00:02:38.709> for<00:02:39.010> negatives<00:02:39.370> in<00:02:39.489> the<00:02:39.580> game

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
academies as for negatives in the game

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.660 
academies as for negatives in the game
there<00:02:40.360> are<00:02:40.600> a<00:02:40.630> couple<00:02:41.080> one<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:42.100> resolution<00:02:42.610> is

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
there are a couple one the resolution is

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.449 
there are a couple one the resolution is
kind<00:02:42.940> of<00:02:43.030> odd<00:02:43.209> it<00:02:43.569> just<00:02:44.350> takes<00:02:44.560> up<00:02:44.770> a<00:02:44.860> small<00:02:45.160> box

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
kind of odd it just takes up a small box

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.520 
kind of odd it just takes up a small box
on<00:02:45.700> your<00:02:45.820> screen<00:02:45.880> and<00:02:46.390> I<00:02:46.630> wish<00:02:47.019> I<00:02:47.170> could<00:02:47.320> put<00:02:47.500> a

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
on your screen and I wish I could put a

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.470 
on your screen and I wish I could put a
full<00:02:47.830> screen<00:02:48.190> or<00:02:48.310> wide<00:02:48.519> screen<00:02:48.940> and<00:02:49.180> that<00:02:49.330> is

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
full screen or wide screen and that is

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.650 
full screen or wide screen and that is
currently<00:02:49.840> impossible<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:51.550> other<00:02:51.940> thing<00:02:52.450> is

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
currently impossible the other thing is

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.540 
currently impossible the other thing is
that<00:02:52.690> this<00:02:53.080> is<00:02:53.140> really<00:02:53.560> not<00:02:53.920> a<00:02:53.980> game<00:02:54.340> for

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
that this is really not a game for

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.520 
that this is really not a game for
everyone<00:02:54.850> this<00:02:55.330> isn't<00:02:55.630> even<00:02:55.750> a<00:02:55.930> game<00:02:56.110> for<00:02:56.380> me

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
while I find the gameplay mechanics very

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.030 
while I find the gameplay mechanics very
