00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:09.360
 what happened to the comet and are 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.800
 presented by science at gaza 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.580
 Astronomers have known for a long time 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.870
 that some comets are in danger 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.720
 many of the biggest kites in the 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.699
 history have flown very close to the sun 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.740
 steaming with its scorching heat before 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.189
 become visible wonders to 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.140
 simple view in the sky and some 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.170
 comets like the risk but the 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.790
 comet and they are not one of them the so 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.530
 expected flyby of the sun by the 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.790
 comet and they are on the action day of 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.410
 thanks of 2013 has ended and instead 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.930
 of becoming a great comet the 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.030
 comet and they are came down informs karl 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.920
 battams a member of the device 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.320
 observation of the comet and are from the nasa 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.140
 now his remains are invisible to simple 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.440
 sight at first glance this may seem 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.600
 something negative but says killed instead 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.910
 to cry with what we have lost such 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.129
 once we should rejoice with what 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.660
 we have won some of the best 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.180
 data on the history of astronomy 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.430
 cometary 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.380
 on the morning of November 28 the 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.870
 expectations were very high as we 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.640
 I was closer to elperi the point more 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.310
 close to the sun 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.409
 on the kite side I already had a beautiful 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.630
 tail 20 times wider than the moon 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.940
 full and a head enough 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.250
 bright as to be able to see it to simple 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.840
 seen before sunrise a dose of 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.410
 solar heat could have transformed 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:33.020
 this comet in something unique during the 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.550
 overflight more than 32 thousand people are 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.810
 they united to fullan if to other scientists 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.610
 solar in google hangout 12 observed 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.890
 live images sent from a 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.840
 fleet of solar observatories 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.940
 including the twin stereo probes the 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.850
 observatory of solar dynamics and the 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:53.479
 Soja probe and comet are approached the 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.190
 bright sun and disappeared this could 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.710
 have been one more case of disintegration 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.390
 says matthew knight of the device 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.970
 observation of the comet and are from the nasa 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.160
 the cameras on board the observatory of 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.300
 solar dynamics followed the comet 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.360
 all the way to the 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.560
 perihelion and they saw nothing we were not 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.750
 sure of what was happening 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.330
 remember light was like a mountain 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.170
 Russian of strong emotions 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.300
 the researchers were surprised 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.420
 when again it emerged from ours 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.890
 the sun a cloud in the form of a fan 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.680
 nobody knew for sure what 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.200
 had inside the possibilities included 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.940
 remains of the nucleus too small to 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.890
 be detected by the observatory of 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.160
 Solar dynamics or a pile of debris 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.320
 or of vaporized fragments at the end of 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.750
 day the comet and sonia was just a 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.460
 dust cloud is disappointing that no 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.770
 we had a spectacular as is 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.450
 visible to the naked eye they say knight but 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.580
 on the other hand I think the comet and they are 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.320
 It has been a very successful way 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.820
 the fans have connected with the 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.220
 comet and they are through the means 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.260
 social was great our website 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.360
 of the observation device of 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.430
 comet and are had more than a million 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.770
 visits and there were problems to download 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.270
 the images near the period because 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.960
 the servers of the nasa almost 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.210
 collapse 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.120
 so maybe and they are was the assignment 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.750
 of the new century battams index is of 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.700
 agreement 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.260
 the comet may be dead but the 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.270
 observation campaign was a success 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.130
 incredible since its discovery in 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.750
 September 2012 the comet and they are ha 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.340
 been observed by a fleet of ships 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.290
 spatially studied in different 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.510
 Spectrum wavelengths 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.000
 electromagnetic and photographed by 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.500
 Thousands of telescopes on earth 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.810
 for months also without interruption 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.870
 always someone or some spaceship 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.790
 had his eyes on the comet when he arrived 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.030
 from beyond the orbit of Jupiter to 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.880
 the doors of the sun itself nothing has been 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.560
 lost the two astronomers expect that 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.290
 the abundance of data finally 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.250
 will allow them and their colleagues 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.320
 unravel the mystery of what 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.120
 it happened exactly with the comet and they are 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.459
 this has been without a doubt the most 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.410
 extraordinary comet that matthew and me and 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.050
 probably many others we have 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.239
 witnessed never says batÃ¡n the universe 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.430
 It is an amazing place and it has only 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.230
 surprised again 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.989
 to get more information about 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.739
 comets alive and dead stay tuned to 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.430
 science
