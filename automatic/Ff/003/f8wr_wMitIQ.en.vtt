00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
of that I can squeeze into my day

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.680 
of that I can squeeze into my day
because<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.369> have<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.729> be<00:02:05.850> back<00:02:06.030> at<00:02:06.060> my<00:02:06.299> parents

but I get to go there right
again<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:13.650> reason<00:02:13.800> why<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.430> rats<00:02:14.670> aren't<00:02:14.910> my

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
again the reason why the rats aren't my

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.630 
again the reason why the rats aren't my
parents

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
parents

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.370 
parents
well<00:02:17.640> I've<00:02:18.030> moved<00:02:18.420> in<00:02:18.570> there<00:02:18.750> for<00:02:18.990> winter

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
well I've moved in there for winter

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.730 
well I've moved in there for winter
because<00:02:20.220> as<00:02:20.580> I<00:02:20.730> told<00:02:20.940> you<00:02:21.180> before<00:02:22.050> my<00:02:22.530> house

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
because as I told you before my house

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.470 
because as I told you before my house
doesn't<00:02:23.100> have<00:02:23.250> central<00:02:23.970> heating<00:02:24.150> so<00:02:26.480> rats

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
doesn't have central heating so rats

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.400 
doesn't have central heating so rats
need<00:02:27.750> a<00:02:27.780> warm<00:02:28.140> climate<00:02:28.650> so<00:02:29.490> I<00:02:30.170> just<00:02:31.170> cannot

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
need a warm climate so I just cannot

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.910 
need a warm climate so I just cannot
provide<00:02:31.770> that<00:02:31.980> for<00:02:32.220> them<00:02:32.400> in<00:02:32.580> Windsor<00:02:32.970> and<00:02:33.920> now

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
provide that for them in Windsor and now

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.260 
provide that for them in Windsor and now
it's<00:02:35.160> getting<00:02:35.280> a<00:02:35.460> little<00:02:35.670> bit<00:02:35.880> warmer<00:02:36.060> at

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
it's getting a little bit warmer at

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.610 
it's getting a little bit warmer at
least<00:02:36.420> in<00:02:36.510> those<00:02:36.600> freezing<00:02:36.810> anymore

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
least in those freezing anymore

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.880 
least in those freezing anymore
so<00:02:37.920> technically<00:02:38.520> I<00:02:38.640> think<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.150> could<00:02:39.740> get<00:02:40.740> my

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
so technically I think I could get my

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.440 
so technically I think I could get my
house<00:02:41.100> to<00:02:41.460> the<00:02:41.490> temperature<00:02:41.970> that<00:02:42.000> they<00:02:42.180> need

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
house to the temperature that they need

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.020 
house to the temperature that they need
but<00:02:43.050> it<00:02:43.230> would<00:02:43.350> cost<00:02:43.530> me<00:02:43.709> a<00:02:43.800> fortune<00:02:44.070> since<00:02:44.730> I

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
but it would cost me a fortune since I

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.770 
but it would cost me a fortune since I
do<00:02:45.209> all<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:46.250> heating<00:02:47.250> with<00:02:47.670> electric<00:02:48.360> little

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
do all the heating with electric little

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.540 
do all the heating with electric little
heater<00:02:49.530> so<00:02:51.380> they're<00:02:52.380> at<00:02:52.560> my<00:02:52.740> parents<00:02:53.130> for<00:02:53.370> now

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550
