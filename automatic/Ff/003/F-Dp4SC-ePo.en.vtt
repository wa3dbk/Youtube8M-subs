00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330 
other videos we had the road tied down

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.779 
other videos we had the road tied down
through<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.450> sample<00:00:15.990> just<00:00:16.139> so<00:00:16.379> she<00:00:16.500> gets<00:00:16.890> used

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
through the sample just so she gets used

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.519 
through the sample just so she gets used
to<00:00:17.970> not<00:00:18.180> being<00:00:18.480> able<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.840> throw<00:00:19.050> her<00:00:19.170> head<00:00:19.380> away

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
to not being able to throw her head away

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.740 
to not being able to throw her head away
okay<00:00:20.490> now<00:00:20.670> we're<00:00:20.939> gonna<00:00:21.000> start<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.449> put<00:00:21.720> a

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
okay now we're gonna start to put a

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.929 
okay now we're gonna start to put a
little<00:00:21.960> bit<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.410> headset<00:00:22.920> on<00:00:23.160> her<00:00:23.460> and

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
little bit of a headset on her and

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.000 
little bit of a headset on her and
that's<00:00:24.420> what<00:00:24.720> this<00:00:24.869> is<00:00:24.930> going<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.350> do<00:00:25.560> for<00:00:25.890> us

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
that's what this is going to do for us

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.009 
that's what this is going to do for us
so<00:00:26.039> if<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:26.490> put<00:00:26.760> your<00:00:26.939> pushes<00:00:27.480> her<00:00:27.599> head<00:00:27.810> up

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
Bridal front given cakes and it isn't a

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.319 
Bridal front given cakes and it isn't a
constant<00:00:49.230> pressure<00:00:49.530> but<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.579> does<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.300> it

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
constant pressure but it does it is it

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.310 
constant pressure but it does it is it
is<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:51.960> leverage<00:00:53.449> bridle<00:00:54.449> too<00:00:54.690> because<00:00:55.020> if<00:00:55.170> you

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
is a leverage bridle too because if you

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.090 
is a leverage bridle too because if you
pull<00:00:55.620> back<00:00:55.829> on<00:00:56.160> that<00:00:56.430> as<00:00:57.149> they<00:00:57.480> resist<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.859> get

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
pull back on that as they resist you get

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.880 
pull back on that as they resist you get
a<00:00:59.129> little<00:00:59.520> bit<00:00:59.670> more<00:00:59.910> leverage<00:01:00.210> this<00:01:00.890> doesn't

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
a little bit more leverage this doesn't

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.310 
a little bit more leverage this doesn't
take<00:01:02.070> very<00:01:02.100> much<00:01:02.609> depend<00:01:03.120> hurts<00:01:03.480> hand<00:01:04.049> around

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
take very much depend hurts hand around

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.149 
take very much depend hurts hand around
here<00:01:04.850> okay<00:01:06.080> that's<00:01:07.080> kind<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.560> what<00:01:07.740> this<00:01:07.920> is

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
here okay that's kind of what this is

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.940 
here okay that's kind of what this is
all<00:01:08.340> about<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:09.360> just<00:01:09.720> helps<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.200> get<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.740> head

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
all about it just helps you get the head

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.350 
all about it just helps you get the head
starting<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.640> go<00:01:11.790> down

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
starting to go down

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.590 
starting to go down
let's<00:01:12.659> see<00:01:12.930> it<00:01:12.990> up<00:01:13.110> close<00:01:14.090> and<00:01:15.090> these<00:01:15.240> are<00:01:15.450> just

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
let's see it up close and these are just

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.480 
let's see it up close and these are just
a<00:01:15.780> regular<00:01:15.960> snap<00:01:16.970> and<00:01:17.970> this<00:01:18.210> comes<00:01:18.570> through

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
a regular snap and this comes through

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.020 
a regular snap and this comes through
spokes<00:01:20.490> on<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.970> stage<00:01:21.210> this<00:01:22.200> wise<00:01:22.500> off

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
spokes on to the stage this wise off

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.560 
spokes on to the stage this wise off
come<00:01:24.030> through<00:01:24.420> your<00:01:24.630> snap<00:01:24.930> will<00:01:25.200> ring<00:01:25.439> like<00:01:26.040> so

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
come through your snap will ring like so

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.600 
come through your snap will ring like so
you<00:01:27.570> can<00:01:27.720> go<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.140> first<00:01:28.409> ring<00:01:28.799> second<00:01:29.400> ring

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
you can go to the first ring second ring

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.370 
you can go to the first ring second ring
or<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.820> third<00:01:30.180> ring<00:01:30.509> on<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.840> mirror<00:01:31.170> like<00:01:31.320> this

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
or the third ring on a mirror like this

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.819 
or the third ring on a mirror like this
the<00:01:31.920> third<00:01:32.159> ring<00:01:32.460> would<00:01:32.640> be<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.909> last<00:01:33.799> one<00:01:34.799> for

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
the third ring would be the last one for

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.640 
the third ring would be the last one for
her<00:01:35.310> I'll<00:01:36.150> start<00:01:36.630> on<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.960> second<00:01:37.470> because

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
her I'll start on the second because

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.580 
her I'll start on the second because
this<00:01:38.040> is<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.280> fairly<00:01:38.939> long<00:01:40.640> tied<00:01:41.640> down<00:01:41.909> part<00:01:42.600> the

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
this is a fairly long tied down part the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.830 
this is a fairly long tied down part the
blue<00:01:44.100> one<00:01:44.369> here<00:01:44.610> this<00:01:44.850> is<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.570> quite<00:01:45.810> a

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
blue one here this is this is quite a

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.780 
blue one here this is this is quite a
bit<00:01:46.110> shorter<00:01:46.619> than<00:01:46.799> this<00:01:46.950> one<00:01:47.189> this<00:01:47.340> is<00:01:47.549> more

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
bit shorter than this one this is more

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.359 
bit shorter than this one this is more
for<00:01:48.000> Arabs<00:01:48.450> or<00:01:48.689> smaller<00:01:49.020> quarter<00:01:49.560> horses<00:01:49.860> okay

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
for Arabs or smaller quarter horses okay

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.510 
for Arabs or smaller quarter horses okay
it's<00:01:51.240> just<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.689> little<00:01:51.869> bit<00:01:52.140> shorter<00:01:52.649> so

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
it's just a little bit shorter so

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.520 
it's just a little bit shorter so
sometimes<00:01:54.240> you'll<00:01:54.570> have<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.960> go<00:01:55.170> with<00:01:55.500> a

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
sometimes you'll have to go with a

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.639 
sometimes you'll have to go with a
little<00:01:55.799> longer<00:01:56.130> unit<00:01:56.790> at<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.540> time<00:01:57.659> but<00:01:58.200> if<00:01:58.500> the

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
little longer unit at a time but if the

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:59.700 
little longer unit at a time but if the
horse<00:01:58.890> is<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.100> little

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
horse is a little

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.710 
horse is a little
smaller<00:01:59.890> like<00:02:00.310> an<00:02:00.490> Arab<00:02:00.880> or<00:02:01.000> the<00:02:01.450> heads

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
smaller like an Arab or the heads

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.859 
smaller like an Arab or the heads
already<00:02:02.200> coming<00:02:02.470> over<00:02:03.030> quite<00:02:04.030> a<00:02:04.060> bit<00:02:04.360> and

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
already coming over quite a bit and
