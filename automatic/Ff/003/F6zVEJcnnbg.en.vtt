 it was blocked by the Lithuanian delegation 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.469
 addresses ponta da da security we 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.449
 disappointed that colleagues of the UN Security Council 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.129
 refused to accept our application with 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.359
 condemnation of the attack on the Russian 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.579
 Embassy in Kiev 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.710
 and this despite the fact that Russia is always 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.200
 supported colleagues in similar 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.210
 There are many situations in recent days 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.229

 we understand and respect the feeling 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.810
 relatives of the victims but you need to remember 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.210
 that people on board were heading to 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.920
 epicenter of military operations that began 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.970

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.220
 official representative of the us state department 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.259
 trying to justify the head of the Ukrainian 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.970
 Mida she believes that thing so 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.369

 the crowd that gathered at the Russian

 I just want to clarify whether you are reading 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.060

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.500

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.930
 know what we can't pronounce 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.090
 similar expressions on in my opinion 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.259
 it is important here in what context and when 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.570
 what circumstances 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:02:00.270

 Iran 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.500
 only here during the performance I was confused 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.300
 Iran 40 to understand what is going on 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.739
 Speech journalists had several times 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.180
 ask psaki 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.250

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.050
 sends almost 300 to baghdad 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.680
 military to protect their 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.390

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.410
 radical groups have already captured 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.930
 two cities where Shiites live in peace 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.370

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.700

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.410

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.690
 Iraqi women and quite 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.610
 voluntarily say that in case 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.610
 attacks manage to defend themselves
