00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.210 
Trophy wine you're making a look at me
kind<00:04:08.019> of<00:04:08.079> statement<00:04:08.560> but<00:04:08.650> I<00:04:08.709> think<00:04:08.920> a<00:04:08.980> lot<00:04:09.190> of

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
kind of statement but I think a lot of

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.309 
kind of statement but I think a lot of
people<00:04:09.579> even<00:04:10.269> if<00:04:10.510> they<00:04:10.629> could<00:04:10.780> still<00:04:11.049> afford

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
people even if they could still afford

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:14.430 
people even if they could still afford
it<00:04:11.530> stop<00:04:12.430> wanting<00:04:12.760> to<00:04:12.940> do<00:04:13.090> so<00:04:13.780> we<00:04:13.930> saw<00:04:14.200> people

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
it stop wanting to do so we saw people

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.949 
it stop wanting to do so we saw people
drinking<00:04:15.340> wine<00:04:15.640> they<00:04:16.060> were<00:04:16.209> much<00:04:16.449> more<00:04:16.479> in<00:04:16.840> the

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
drinking wine they were much more in the

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.560 
drinking wine they were much more in the
moderate<00:04:17.350> part<00:04:17.739> of<00:04:17.829> the<00:04:18.010> list<00:04:18.220> wines<00:04:19.209> that

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
moderate part of the list wines that

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.310 
moderate part of the list wines that
were<00:04:19.720> close<00:04:20.079> early<00:04:20.530> much<00:04:21.400> more<00:04:21.609> closely<00:04:22.060> tied

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
were close early much more closely tied

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.379 
were close early much more closely tied
to<00:04:23.320> the<00:04:23.500> average<00:04:24.010> entree<00:04:24.520> price<00:04:24.789> on<00:04:25.000> the<00:04:25.090> menu

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:25.389 
to the average entree price on the menu

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:27.659 
to the average entree price on the menu
but<00:04:26.020> the<00:04:26.139> other<00:04:26.289> thing<00:04:26.530> we<00:04:26.680> saw<00:04:26.889> and<00:04:27.250> I<00:04:27.430> think

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
but the other thing we saw and I think

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:29.520 
but the other thing we saw and I think
this<00:04:27.850> goes<00:04:28.060> hand-in-hand<00:04:28.539> with<00:04:28.720> a<00:04:28.960> food<00:04:29.229> trend

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
this goes hand-in-hand with a food trend

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.189 
this goes hand-in-hand with a food trend
is<00:04:30.030> that<00:04:31.030> people<00:04:31.389> were<00:04:31.570> ordering<00:04:31.870> more<00:04:32.110> and

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 
is that people were ordering more and

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:34.379 
is that people were ordering more and
more<00:04:32.350> wines<00:04:32.590> by<00:04:32.830> the<00:04:32.860> glass<00:04:32.979> by<00:04:33.610> the<00:04:33.669> Cortino

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
more wines by the glass by the Cortino

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:37.440 
more wines by the glass by the Cortino
but<00:04:34.990> a<00:04:35.020> half<00:04:35.260> bottle<00:04:35.530> and<00:04:35.860> they<00:04:36.700> get<00:04:36.970> it<00:04:37.120> not

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
but a half bottle and they get it not

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:38.820 
but a half bottle and they get it not
just<00:04:37.660> because<00:04:37.840> they<00:04:38.080> wanted<00:04:38.289> to<00:04:38.349> spend<00:04:38.590> less

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
just because they wanted to spend less

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.100 
just because they wanted to spend less
money<00:04:38.889> as<00:04:39.400> a<00:04:39.460> matter<00:04:39.639> of<00:04:39.729> fact<00:04:39.970> if<00:04:40.660> you<00:04:40.870> order

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
money as a matter of fact if you order
