00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.750
 Hello, I want to show you how to change 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:29.619
 my old key ring 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:33.220
 the t-60 is pretty shabby for seven years 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:35.949
 steam room labeling sat all erased 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:42.610
 squirrel is already a very bad species 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:44.680
 I found 1499 Chinese on ebay 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.290
 trinket well how would I think delivery 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.320
 for free what the quality is like so what 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.809
 here came the key chain came I already 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.170
 keychain with a lid divided into two parts 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.550
 with the ability to change the battery in 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.219
 difference from old 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:05.050
 didn't let me even open it here 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.810
 strain so first things we must 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:11.369
 pull out the key the car key itself from 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.960
 keychain so we pulled out no longer the cap 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.580
 peeled off I say the keychain went up to 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.580
 its logical conclusion 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.340
 so you need to change now what are we 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.329
 do so as a fob unreassembled us 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.360
 you need to break it 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:27.579
 about what to break along the edge without damaging 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.259
 chips for this take a knife and 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:35.740
 we start to break it around 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:38.920
 insert the knife into the slot and start 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.780
 break the key chain into pieces without trying 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.450
 do not damage of course electronic 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.469
 stuffing 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.509
 I have already expanded a little q I want to show you 

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:53.110
 especially here the chip stands here as 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:55.030
 just the same and u need not damage gently 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.100
 knife sharp 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.020
 On the chip Ryazan these then plush 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.439
 will have to order and encodes the new in 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.710
 center 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:06.009
 we broke the key chain and got to 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:10.929
 electronic part of the most important and so 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:11.530
 compare the top of the principle the same 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.420
 the most 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:19.329
 the only silicone is a little bit bigger 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:21.850
 white bottom is very profitable 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:23.470
 characterized by the fact that there is access to the battery 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.349
 that is, I can change the battery 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.700
 parsing the hull itself and so old lady 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:32.620
 body postpone 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.940
 I will have to change the battery side 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.940
 anyway battery 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:40.390
 because at 10 weak points but I can 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:43.200
 do everything later install 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:46.140
 microcircuit in place in the new case and 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.640
 the new building is just great 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:53.680
 snaps into place 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:56.530
 since we are the foundation plump to them 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.610
 planets jelly nothing and at the end 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.610
 insert the key 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:08.799
 voila here's a new keychain 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:10.150
 normal with all the inscriptions with the icon 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:13.599
 borovoe new 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:17.160
 everything is fine thanks to all if you have 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:17.160
 ask questions
