00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
hey guys I'm back today and I promised a

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.320 
hey guys I'm back today and I promised a
couple<00:00:04.380> of<00:00:04.470> my<00:00:04.620> friends<00:00:04.799> that<00:00:05.279> I<00:00:05.730> would<00:00:06.060> do<00:00:06.299> a

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
couple of my friends that I would do a

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.430 
couple of my friends that I would do a
quick<00:00:06.779> comparison<00:00:07.290> of<00:00:08.099> my<00:00:08.460> saline<00:00:08.940> micro<00:00:09.450> next

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
quick comparison of my saline micro next

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.150 
quick comparison of my saline micro next
two<00:00:11.150> bags<00:00:12.150> like<00:00:13.080> common<00:00:13.469> bags<00:00:13.710> that<00:00:13.980> other

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
two bags like common bags that other

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.849 
two bags like common bags that other
people<00:00:14.429> might<00:00:14.610> have<00:00:14.639> just<00:00:15.120> for<00:00:15.360> size

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:15.859 
people might have just for size

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:19.370 
people might have just for size
reference<00:00:16.859> so<00:00:17.520> this<00:00:18.029> is<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.449> saline<00:00:18.930> micro

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
reference so this is the saline micro

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.150 
reference so this is the saline micro
next<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.520> speedy<00:00:21.000> 30<00:00:21.470> so<00:00:22.470> as<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:22.680> can<00:00:22.830> see

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
next to the speedy 30 so as you can see

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.210 
next to the speedy 30 so as you can see
I<00:00:23.570> think<00:00:24.570> that<00:00:25.230> they're<00:00:25.410> pretty<00:00:25.650> comparable

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
I think that they're pretty comparable

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.000 
I think that they're pretty comparable
in<00:00:26.580> size<00:00:26.609> even<00:00:27.480> though<00:00:27.630> one<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.529> actually<00:00:28.769> a

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
in size even though one is actually a

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.560 
in size even though one is actually a
little<00:00:29.369> bit<00:00:29.519> taller<00:00:29.699> obviously<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.330> saline

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
little bit taller obviously the saline

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.040 
little bit taller obviously the saline
micro<00:00:30.960> is<00:00:31.080> feels<00:00:31.800> more<00:00:32.130> like<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:33.390> don't<00:00:33.989> know

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
micro is feels more like a I don't know

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.940 
micro is feels more like a I don't know
it<00:00:34.230> feels<00:00:34.380> more<00:00:34.680> like<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:35.630> north/south<00:00:36.630> bag<00:00:37.620> to

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
it feels more like a north/south bag to

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.830 
it feels more like a north/south bag to
me<00:00:38.100> even<00:00:38.340> though<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:38.940> shouldn't<00:00:39.390> because<00:00:39.510> it

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
me even though it shouldn't because it

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.139 
me even though it shouldn't because it
is<00:00:39.989> pretty<00:00:40.350> wide<00:00:40.800> too<00:00:41.340> as<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:41.670> can<00:00:41.850> see<00:00:42.030> like

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
is pretty wide too as you can see like

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.770 
is pretty wide too as you can see like
it<00:00:42.210> opens<00:00:42.719> up<00:00:42.930> so<00:00:43.219> big<00:00:44.219> but<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:45.090> would<00:00:45.510> say<00:00:45.750> that

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
it opens up so big but I would say that

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.020 
it opens up so big but I would say that
in<00:00:46.110> terms<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.860> look<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.430> how<00:00:47.700> much<00:00:47.879> it

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
in terms of the look and how much it

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.810 
in terms of the look and how much it
holds<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.719> would<00:00:49.379> compare<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.550> speedy

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
holds I would compare it to the speedy

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.840 
holds I would compare it to the speedy
30<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:52.079> that's<00:00:52.260> how<00:00:52.500> they<00:00:52.949> look<00:00:53.190> next<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.730> each

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
30 so that's how they look next to each

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.990 
30 so that's how they look next to each
other<00:00:53.969> let<00:00:54.420> me<00:00:54.449> pan<00:00:54.750> out<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.960> little<00:00:55.230> bit<00:00:55.469> and

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
other let me pan out a little bit and

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.990 
other let me pan out a little bit and
then<00:00:57.000> this<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.719> how<00:00:57.989> they<00:00:58.230> look

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
then this is how they look

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.820 
then this is how they look
side-by-side<00:01:01.550> there<00:01:02.550> they<00:01:02.760> are

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
side-by-side there they are

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:09.140 
side-by-side there they are
front<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.040> back<00:01:06.110> so<00:01:07.110> now<00:01:07.439> here<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.580> saline

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
front and back so now here is the saline

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.600 
front and back so now here is the saline
micro<00:01:09.479> next<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.290> never<00:01:10.560> full<00:01:10.860> mmm

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.399 

obviously<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.850> never<00:01:15.090> full<00:01:15.390> mmm<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:15.990> taller

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
obviously the never full mmm is taller

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.050 
obviously the never full mmm is taller
and<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:17.070> lot<00:01:17.310> wider<00:01:18.140> the<00:01:19.140> saline<00:01:19.409> micro<00:01:20.060> maybe

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
and a lot wider the saline micro maybe

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.020 
and a lot wider the saline micro maybe
could<00:01:21.420> be<00:01:21.450> compared<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.619> PM<00:01:23.189> never<00:01:23.700> full

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
could be compared to the PM never full

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.170 
could be compared to the PM never full
as<00:01:24.840> far<00:01:25.140> as<00:01:25.229> how<00:01:25.380> much<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.680> holds<00:01:25.970> there<00:01:26.970> they

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
as far as how much it holds there they

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.179 
as far as how much it holds there they
are<00:01:27.210> side-by-side<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:28.590> they're<00:01:28.799> both<00:01:28.920> kind

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
are side-by-side and they're both kind

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.719 
are side-by-side and they're both kind
of<00:01:29.400> blending<00:01:30.060> over<00:01:30.210> right<00:01:30.540> now<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:31.729> then

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
of blending over right now and then

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.060 
of blending over right now and then
there<00:01:33.060> they<00:01:33.270> are<00:01:33.390> front<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:33.930> back<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.680> wings

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
there they are front and back the wings

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.910 
there they are front and back the wings
on<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.640> micro<00:01:36.030> really<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:36.780> mean<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.439> puts<00:01:37.650> up<00:01:37.829> a

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
on the micro really I mean it puts up a

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.520 
on the micro really I mean it puts up a
good<00:01:37.950> fight<00:01:38.369> as<00:01:38.670> far<00:01:38.939> as<00:01:39.090> being<00:01:39.869> compared<00:01:40.380> and

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
good fight as far as being compared and

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.530 
good fight as far as being compared and
looking<00:01:40.860> bigger<00:01:41.549> than<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:41.970> actually<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.420> and

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
looking bigger than it actually is and

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.289 
looking bigger than it actually is and
it<00:01:42.899> actually<00:01:43.560> helps<00:01:43.920> it<00:01:44.100> hold<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.610> lot<00:01:44.820> more<00:01:44.850> -

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
it actually helps it hold a lot more -

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.870 
it actually helps it hold a lot more -
so<00:01:46.049> that's<00:01:46.170> why<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.500> feel<00:01:46.950> like<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.399> shouldn't

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
so that's why I feel like it shouldn't

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.069 
so that's why I feel like it shouldn't
be<00:01:47.939> dismissed<00:01:48.479> as<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:49.110> size<00:01:50.009> four<00:01:50.670> taller<00:01:51.659> girls

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
be dismissed as a size four taller girls

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.359 
be dismissed as a size four taller girls
like<00:01:52.380> if<00:01:52.500> you're<00:01:52.619> worried<00:01:52.979> about<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.340> looking

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
like if you're worried about it looking

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.620 
like if you're worried about it looking
too<00:01:54.270> like<00:01:55.040> kid<00:01:56.040> bag<00:01:56.310> like<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.909> won't<00:01:57.090> because

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
too like kid bag like it won't because

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:08.680 
too like kid bag like it won't because
of<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.899> wings

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.680 

so<00:02:09.620> there's<00:02:09.860> guys<00:02:10.310> now<00:02:10.580> there<00:02:10.880> it<00:02:11.030> is<00:02:11.180> compared

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
so there's guys now there it is compared

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:18.670 
so there's guys now there it is compared
to<00:02:11.870> my<00:02:12.020> Balenciaga<00:02:12.620> city<00:02:15.820> and<00:02:17.680> obviously

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
to my Balenciaga city and obviously

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.800 
to my Balenciaga city and obviously
these<00:02:18.950> are<00:02:19.190> very<00:02:19.460> very<00:02:19.700> different<00:02:20.150> styles<00:02:20.720> but

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
these are very very different styles but

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.840 
these are very very different styles but
I<00:02:20.930> just<00:02:21.140> want<00:02:21.350> to<00:02:21.410> give<00:02:21.560> you<00:02:21.710> sort<00:02:22.430> of<00:02:22.640> a

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
I just want to give you sort of a

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.580 
I just want to give you sort of a
comparison<00:02:23.660> to<00:02:23.810> bags<00:02:23.990> that<00:02:24.260> you<00:02:24.320> might

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
comparison to bags that you might
