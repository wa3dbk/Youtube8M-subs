00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
hey guys George you here and in this

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:10.879 
hey guys George you here and in this
video<00:00:09.780> we're<00:00:10.049> just<00:00:10.080> gonna<00:00:10.320> talk<00:00:10.590> about<00:00:10.619> the

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
video we're just gonna talk about the

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.390 
video we're just gonna talk about the
new<00:00:12.019> FLIR<00:00:13.019> Tao<00:00:14.029> 324<00:00:15.029> for<00:00:15.359> the<00:00:15.449> matrix<00:00:15.869> II<00:00:16.400> and

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
new FLIR Tao 324 for the matrix II and

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.590 
new FLIR Tao 324 for the matrix II and
we<00:00:17.670> just<00:00:17.850> have<00:00:17.939> it<00:00:18.060> mounted<00:00:18.180> here<00:00:18.449> with<00:00:18.570> a

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
we just have it mounted here with a

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.510 
we just have it mounted here with a
simple<00:00:18.840> tilt<00:00:19.170> mechanism<00:00:19.609> and<00:00:20.609> we<00:00:20.970> have<00:00:21.119> two

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:22.520 
simple tilt mechanism and we have two

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.090 
simple tilt mechanism and we have two
vibration<00:00:23.520> dampers<00:00:24.480> they're<00:00:24.869> built<00:00:25.770> a<00:00:25.890> little

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:26.100 
vibration dampers they're built a little

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.950 
vibration dampers they're built a little
case<00:00:26.310> around<00:00:26.610> it<00:00:26.820> just<00:00:26.940> using<00:00:27.330> some<00:00:27.510> aluminum

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
case around it just using some aluminum

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.010 
case around it just using some aluminum
spacers<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:29.100> on<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.150> back<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.539> it<00:00:30.660> we<00:00:30.779> have

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.020 
spacers and on the back of it we have

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:38.829 
spacers and on the back of it we have
the<00:00:32.719> module<00:00:33.719> there<00:00:35.390> it's<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.570> V<00:00:36.989> PC<00:00:37.199> module

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:38.839 
the module there it's the V PC module

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:44.450 
the module there it's the V PC module
and<00:00:39.839> it's<00:00:40.229> also<00:00:40.589> below<00:00:41.059> the<00:00:42.059> NEX<00:00:42.659> so<00:00:43.260> these<00:00:44.249> are

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
and it's also below the NEX so these are

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.009 
and it's also below the NEX so these are
actually<00:00:44.819> independently<00:00:45.359> controlled<00:00:45.809> on<00:00:45.989> the

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:46.019 
actually independently controlled on the

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:46.610 
actually independently controlled on the
radio

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
radio

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.939 
radio
using<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.249> 14sg<00:00:47.760> we<00:00:48.120> can<00:00:48.289> set<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.440> Fleur<00:00:49.679> to

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:49.949 
using the 14sg we can set the Fleur to

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:52.879 
using the 14sg we can set the Fleur to
the<00:00:50.039> left<00:00:50.249> slider<00:00:50.989> and<00:00:51.989> we<00:00:52.379> can<00:00:52.530> something

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:52.889 
the left slider and we can something

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:56.360 
the left slider and we can something
next<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.309> right<00:00:53.489> slider<00:00:53.819> and<00:00:55.249> what<00:00:56.249> we

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
next to the right slider and what we

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.189 
next to the right slider and what we
pretty<00:00:56.549> much<00:00:56.639> can<00:00:56.940> do<00:00:57.149> is<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:57.839> has<00:00:57.989> got<00:00:58.049> a

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
pretty much can do is this has got a

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.840 
pretty much can do is this has got a
seven<00:00:58.530> point<00:00:58.649> five<00:00:58.859> millimeter<00:00:59.280> lens<00:00:59.549> for

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
seven point five millimeter lens for

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.360 
seven point five millimeter lens for
thermal<00:01:00.209> imaging<00:01:00.629> it's<00:01:01.620> got<00:01:01.739> about<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.949> sixty

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
thermal imaging it's got about a sixty

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.759 
thermal imaging it's got about a sixty
eight<00:01:02.489> degree<00:01:02.819> field<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.569> view<00:01:03.629> so<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.589> works

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
eight degree field of view so it works

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.990 
eight degree field of view so it works
great<00:01:04.890> for<00:01:05.100> fpv<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:07.010> it's<00:01:08.010> just<00:01:08.220> mainly<00:01:08.640> used

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
great for fpv and it's just mainly used

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.750 
great for fpv and it's just mainly used
for<00:01:09.299> search-and-rescue<00:01:09.870> or<00:01:10.680> if<00:01:11.490> you're

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
for search-and-rescue or if you're

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.930 
for search-and-rescue or if you're
trying<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.840> watch<00:01:12.990> wildlife<00:01:13.350> or<00:01:14.010> doing

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
trying to watch wildlife or doing

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.360 
trying to watch wildlife or doing
different<00:01:15.450> plant<00:01:15.690> studies<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.410> now<00:01:17.040> we<00:01:17.100> can

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.370 
different plant studies and now we can

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.930 
different plant studies and now we can
put<00:01:17.550> these<00:01:17.700> on<00:01:17.940> the<00:01:18.120> matrix<00:01:18.630> II<00:01:18.900> platform<00:01:19.940> and

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
put these on the matrix II platform and

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.610 
put these on the matrix II platform and
this<00:01:21.210> has<00:01:21.360> got<00:01:21.510> the<00:01:21.600> extended<00:01:21.960> legs<00:01:22.230> on<00:01:22.470> it

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.620 
this has got the extended legs on it

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.210 
this has got the extended legs on it
that<00:01:22.800> fits<00:01:23.070> nicely<00:01:23.580> under<00:01:24.000> there<00:01:24.800> and<00:01:25.800> we're

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
that fits nicely under there and we're

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.620 
that fits nicely under there and we're
gonna<00:01:26.310> show<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.550> some<00:01:26.760> footage<00:01:26.910> now<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:27.480> enjoy

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
gonna show you some footage now so enjoy

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.390 
gonna show you some footage now so enjoy
