00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
about the Snapdragon 800 this is the CPU

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:08.299 
about the Snapdragon 800 this is the CPU
you're<00:00:07.529> going<00:00:07.649> to<00:00:07.710> want<00:00:07.830> in<00:00:07.919> all<00:00:08.099> of<00:00:08.189> your

you're going to want in all of your
phones<00:00:08.550> it's<00:00:08.940> a<00:00:09.030> successor<00:00:09.630> to<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:09.809> s4<00:00:10.590> pro

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
phones it's a successor to the s4 pro

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.980 
phones it's a successor to the s4 pro
why<00:00:11.280> they<00:00:11.490> didn't<00:00:11.759> call<00:00:11.849> it<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.059> s4<00:00:12.360> pro<00:00:12.570> 2<00:00:12.840> or

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
why they didn't call it the s4 pro 2 or

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.360 
why they didn't call it the s4 pro 2 or
something<00:00:13.349> I<00:00:13.530> don't<00:00:13.740> know<00:00:13.980> it's<00:00:14.130> a<00:00:14.160> little

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
something I don't know it's a little

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.770 
something I don't know it's a little
confusing<00:00:14.490> with<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:14.849> 800<00:00:15.269> we're<00:00:15.509> going<00:00:15.690> to

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
confusing with the 800 we're going to

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.540 
confusing with the 800 we're going to
take<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:15.929> look<00:00:16.170> at<00:00:16.320> some<00:00:16.560> reference<00:00:17.250> hardware

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
take a look at some reference hardware

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:26.300 
take a look at some reference hardware
to<00:00:17.640> see<00:00:17.789> how<00:00:17.970> it<00:00:18.119> performs<00:00:24.980> ok<00:00:25.980> so<00:00:26.039> what<00:00:26.220> we

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
to see how it performs ok so what we

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.800 
to see how it performs ok so what we
have<00:00:26.430> here<00:00:26.580> some<00:00:26.760> reference<00:00:27.150> hardware<00:00:27.599> we've

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
have here some reference hardware we've

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.050 
have here some reference hardware we've
got<00:00:27.960> asphalt<00:00:28.500> 7<00:00:28.680> which<00:00:28.980> one<00:00:29.160> most<00:00:29.429> Android

1080 just as a frame of reference let's

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.780 
1080 just as a frame of reference let's
take<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.379> look

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.840 

pretty<00:00:43.450> smooth<00:00:43.870> as<00:00:44.080> butter<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:45.550> definitely

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
pretty smooth as butter it definitely

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.610 
pretty smooth as butter it definitely
was<00:00:46.090> to<00:00:46.210> notice<00:00:46.510> a<00:00:46.630> small<00:00:46.840> time<00:00:47.110> experience

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
was to notice a small time experience

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.410 
was to notice a small time experience
that<00:00:47.740> I've<00:00:47.830> ever<00:00:48.010> seen<00:00:48.250> on<00:00:48.640> an<00:00:48.850> android<00:00:49.390> phone

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
that I've ever seen on an android phone

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.890 
that I've ever seen on an android phone
or<00:00:49.960> tablet<00:00:50.880> maybe<00:00:51.880> even<00:00:52.120> as<00:00:52.360> good<00:00:52.510> as<00:00:52.630> it<00:00:52.750> is<00:00:52.780> on

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 
or tablet maybe even as good as it is on

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.900 
or tablet maybe even as good as it is on
iOS<00:00:53.610> dare<00:00:54.610> I<00:00:54.670> say<00:00:55.050> so

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:57.910 
iOS dare I say so

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.300 
iOS dare I say so
textures<00:00:58.660> a<00:00:58.780> good<00:00:58.960> frame<00:00:59.260> rate<00:00:59.440> is<00:00:59.650> quite<00:00:59.920> good

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:00.310 
textures a good frame rate is quite good

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.580 
textures a good frame rate is quite good
so<00:01:00.610> let's<00:01:01.210> stop<00:01:01.570> this<00:01:01.810> real<00:01:02.110> quick<00:01:02.380> and

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
so let's stop this real quick and

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:03.780 
so let's stop this real quick and
actually<00:01:03.070> just<00:01:03.250> bounce<00:01:03.460> around<00:01:03.670> the

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:03.790 
actually just bounce around the

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.610 
actually just bounce around the
operating<00:01:04.180> system<00:01:04.449> quickly<00:01:04.690> again<00:01:05.350> this<00:01:05.500> is

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:05.620 
operating system quickly again this is

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:06.660 
operating system quickly again this is
reference<00:01:05.950> hardware<00:01:06.250> there's<00:01:06.430> nothing

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
reference hardware there's nothing

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.550 
reference hardware there's nothing
really<00:01:06.790> on<00:01:06.940> here<00:01:07.420> just<00:01:08.020> just<00:01:08.200> to<00:01:08.320> give<00:01:08.440> you<00:01:08.500> a

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
really on here just just to give you a

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.770 
really on here just just to give you a
sense<00:01:08.800> of<00:01:08.920> the<00:01:08.979> speed<00:01:09.280> and<00:01:09.400> fluidity<00:01:09.750> with<00:01:10.750> a

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
sense of the speed and fluidity with a

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.020 
sense of the speed and fluidity with a
really<00:01:11.170> fibrous<00:01:11.380> screen<00:01:11.860> is<00:01:12.430> just<00:01:12.640> running<00:01:12.820> on

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
really fibrous screen is just running on

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.090 
really fibrous screen is just running on
a<00:01:13.090> jelly<00:01:13.780> bean<00:01:13.930> to<00:01:14.110> keep<00:01:14.260> it<00:01:14.380> snappy<00:01:14.590> keep<00:01:14.979> it

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
a jelly bean to keep it snappy keep it

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.070 
a jelly bean to keep it snappy keep it
good<00:01:15.220> and<00:01:15.280> again<00:01:16.240> it's<00:01:16.450> really<00:01:16.630> difficult<00:01:16.810> to

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
good and again it's really difficult to

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:25.160 
good and again it's really difficult to
tell

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.260 

in<00:01:26.170> your<00:01:26.320> next<00:01:26.470> devices<00:01:27.100> and<00:01:27.340> we<00:01:28.030> can't<00:01:28.210> wait

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
in your next devices and we can't wait

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.510 
in your next devices and we can't wait
to<00:01:28.360> see<00:01:28.480> phones<00:01:29.440> and<00:01:29.590> tablets<00:01:29.890> with<00:01:30.010> the<00:01:30.100> 800

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
to see phones and tablets with the 800

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.820 
to see phones and tablets with the 800
so<00:01:31.390> what<00:01:31.510> we<00:01:31.600> have<00:01:31.690> here<00:01:31.720> is<00:01:32.020> an<00:01:32.110> environment

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
so what we have here is an environment

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.680 
so what we have here is an environment
that<00:01:32.950> qualcomm<00:01:33.730> need<00:01:33.940> to<00:01:34.120> really<00:01:34.390> showcase

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
that qualcomm need to really showcase

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.590 
that qualcomm need to really showcase
the<00:01:35.110> power<00:01:35.350> of<00:01:35.950> the<00:01:36.010> Snapdragon<00:01:36.730> 800<00:01:37.210> so<00:01:37.390> what

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
the power of the Snapdragon 800 so what

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.080 
the power of the Snapdragon 800 so what
we<00:01:37.720> have<00:01:37.900> years<00:01:38.170> and<00:01:38.380> really<00:01:38.680> has<00:01:39.550> reflected

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
we have years and really has reflected

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.800 
we have years and really has reflected
certain<00:01:40.390> water

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
certain water

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:53.590 
certain water
smooth<00:01:48.159> texture<00:01:49.159> is<00:01:49.220> great<00:01:49.549> like<00:01:52.299> walk<00:01:53.299> on<00:01:53.450> me

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
smooth texture is great like walk on me

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.079 
smooth texture is great like walk on me
this<00:01:53.720> eternity
