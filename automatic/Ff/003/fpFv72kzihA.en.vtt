00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:02.418
 Part 2: Storm. 

00:00:04.786 --> 00:00:09.032
 20,000 years ago, the world was writhing in the grip of the last ice age. 

00:00:10.184 --> 00:00:12.683
 Global temperature for thousands of years 

00:00:12.684 --> 00:00:15.183
 average 8 from today 

00:00:15.184 --> 00:00:17.689
 Celsius degree took a lower level. 

00:00:18.658 --> 00:00:21.157
 One mile thick glaciers 

00:00:21.158 --> 00:00:24.998
 It covered most of North America, Europe and Asia. 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.859
 Areas outside of ice-covered areas 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.526
 it was so dry that it was hard to live around here. 

00:00:34.018 --> 00:00:39.007
 Long-lived areas have become irreplaceable. 

00:00:39.984 --> 00:00:42.483
 But despite all these difficulties 

00:00:42.484 --> 00:00:44.983
 a part of people like northern Siberia 

00:00:44.984 --> 00:00:47.483
 even in remote and tough areas 

00:00:47.484 --> 00:00:49.656
 they found ways to survive. 

00:00:50.757 --> 00:00:54.296
 However, between the groups of human walls, the ice age 

00:00:54.955 --> 00:00:56.912
 it was also building bridges. 

00:00:58.013 --> 00:01:01.780
 So large that the water had been freezing 

00:01:02.237 --> 00:01:03.802
 sea ​​levels dropped 

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:07.792
 and part of the land between Alaska and Siberia. 

00:01:09.739 --> 00:01:13.943
 A few people living in Siberia knew to use this natural bridge ... 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.777
 And first to Alaska, then to the south. 

00:01:19.265 --> 00:01:21.744
 It spread to other parts of North America. 

00:01:22.817 --> 00:01:25.678
 Maybe they followed the flocks of migrating animals. 

00:01:26.701 --> 00:01:31.391
 Maybe they've traveled on small boats along the Great Ocean coast. 

00:01:31.963 --> 00:01:34.101
 Maybe they did both. 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.889
 Whichever way they came 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.067
 these people formed the ancestors of today's Native Americans. 

00:01:43.608 --> 00:01:48.751
 People from a small corner of Africa in a short time 

00:01:49.236 --> 00:01:52.219
 It was located on all continents except Antarctica. 

00:01:53.921 --> 00:02:02.128
 The languages ​​they use in their new territory have begun to differentiate over time and form the pioneers of the languages ​​we speak today. 

00:02:03.698 --> 00:02:08.364
 Some communities are unlikely to survive in the ice age. 

00:02:10.002 --> 00:02:16.890
 The groups that managed to survive the ice age survived an isolated life from other groups. 

00:02:17.788 --> 00:02:25.736
 These groups, which are distributed all over the world, have separated from each other verbally, culturally and genetically. 

00:02:26.992 --> 00:02:29.438
 These cultural innovations 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:31.570
 several of these groups 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.858
 more dramatically expand 

00:02:36.513 --> 00:02:37.952
 How could it have impacted?
