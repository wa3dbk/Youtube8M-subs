power<00:00:50.610> rail<00:00:51.230> three<00:00:52.230> power<00:00:52.470> rails<00:00:53.420> and<00:00:54.420> you're

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
power rail three power rails and you're

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.360 
power rail three power rails and you're
gonna<00:00:54.720> want<00:00:55.019> to<00:00:55.489> block<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:58.160> make<00:00:59.160> sure

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
gonna want to block a that make sure

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.160 
gonna want to block a that make sure
that<00:00:59.400> works

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
that works

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.130 
that works
alright<00:01:01.170> so<00:01:01.350> that's<00:01:01.530> starting<00:01:01.920> for<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:03.140> just

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
alright so that's starting for it just

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.030 
alright so that's starting for it just
extend<00:01:04.440> one<00:01:04.949> on<00:01:05.640> each<00:01:05.820> side<00:01:06.650> hold<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.800> small

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
extend one on each side hold a small

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.580

wall put a button
and<00:01:12.860> a<00:01:13.729> block<00:01:14.360> behind<00:01:15.579> and<00:01:16.579> then<00:01:17.149> we're<00:01:17.479> and

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
and a block behind and then we're and

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.760 
and a block behind and then we're and
get<00:01:18.140> somewhere<00:01:19.390> so<00:01:20.390> then<00:01:20.600> for<00:01:20.869> this<00:01:21.049> you're

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:36.289 
and put a power drill rail on top like

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:39.320 
and put a power drill rail on top like
so

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.200

all right and then you want to take
redstone<00:01:42.870> and<00:01:43.700> make<00:01:44.700> an<00:01:44.850> RS<00:01:45.210> nor<00:01:45.570> latch<00:01:45.630> if<00:01:46.470> you

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
redstone and make an RS nor latch if you

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:47.800 
redstone and make an RS nor latch if you
don't<00:01:46.830> know<00:01:46.890> what<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.070> is

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.150 

all<00:02:17.510> righty-roo<00:02:18.700> alright<00:02:19.930> so<00:02:20.930> then<00:02:21.140> put<00:02:21.950> a

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
all righty-roo alright so then put a

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.580 
all righty-roo alright so then put a
block<00:02:22.520> there<00:02:23.770> block<00:02:24.770> there

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
block there block there

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.480 
block there block there
since<00:02:27.220> you<00:02:27.310> saw<00:02:27.459> our<00:02:27.850> buttons<00:02:28.150> are<00:02:28.330> you<00:02:29.110> wanna

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
since you saw our buttons are you wanna

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:36.650 
since you saw our buttons are you wanna
put<00:02:30.490> that<00:02:30.670> up<00:02:30.819> then<00:02:32.550> all<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:33.819> way<00:02:33.910> around

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.500 

and<00:02:37.490> you<00:02:38.490> might<00:02:38.700> want<00:02:38.910> to<00:02:38.970> use<00:02:39.120> a<00:02:39.150> repeater

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
and you might want to use a repeater

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.140 
and you might want to use a repeater
here<00:02:40.070> just<00:02:41.070> just<00:02:41.460> be<00:02:41.670> safe

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
here just just be safe

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.230 
here just just be safe
so<00:02:42.300> it<00:02:42.390> doesn't<00:02:42.540> run<00:02:42.810> out<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:44.700> same<00:02:44.940> on<00:02:45.090> this

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
so it doesn't run out the same on this

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:54.180 
so it doesn't run out the same on this
side<00:02:46.670> take<00:02:47.670> care<00:02:47.940> to<00:02:48.180> minecarts<00:02:49.490> chests<00:02:50.490> and

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:01.580 

let's<00:02:54.970> do<00:02:55.210> that<00:02:56.610> it's<00:02:57.610> down<00:02:58.590> it's<00:02:59.590> temporarily

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
let's do that it's down it's temporarily

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:12.080 
let's do that it's down it's temporarily
and<00:03:02.590> let's<00:03:02.799> see<00:03:03.040> if<00:03:03.069> it<00:03:03.250> works

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.570
