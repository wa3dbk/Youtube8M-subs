the animated line if you ask me I still

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.269 
the animated line if you ask me I still
think<00:00:21.270> that<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.840> blazing<00:00:22.260> lockdown<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:23.039> still

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
think that the blazing lockdown is still

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.710 
think that the blazing lockdown is still
the<00:00:23.460> best<00:00:23.930> among<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.140> lot<00:00:25.320> of<00:00:25.949> lock<00:00:26.189> downs<00:00:26.720> and

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
the best among the lot of lock downs and

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.900 
the best among the lot of lock downs and
then<00:00:27.990> in<00:00:28.109> alt<00:00:28.320> mode<00:00:28.560> you<00:00:29.160> can<00:00:29.189> see<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:29.789> the

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
then in alt mode you can see that the

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.229 
then in alt mode you can see that the
gold<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.660> black<00:00:30.900> really<00:00:31.740> do<00:00:32.430> justice<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:32.969> this

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239

figure<00:00:47.910> what's<00:00:48.690> nice<00:00:48.899> about<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.230> is<00:00:49.469> they<00:00:49.649> just

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
figure what's nice about it is they just

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.160 
figure what's nice about it is they just
repaint<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.969> original<00:00:51.420> figure<00:00:51.750> where<00:00:51.960> the

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
repaint the original figure where the

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.029 
repaint the original figure where the
old<00:00:52.920> paint<00:00:53.250> used<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.760> be<00:00:53.910> they<00:00:54.570> really<00:00:55.039> changed

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
old paint used to be they really changed

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.229 
old paint used to be they really changed
the<00:00:56.309> whole<00:00:56.460> deck<00:00:57.390> or<00:00:57.629> for<00:00:57.989> this<00:00:58.170> figure<00:00:58.940> and<00:00:59.940> I

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
the whole deck or for this figure and I

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.009 
the whole deck or for this figure and I
think<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.960> think<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:01.859> that's<00:01:02.190> now<00:01:03.120> as<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:03.960> said

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
think I think that that's now as I said

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.980 
think I think that that's now as I said
before<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.739> thought<00:01:05.100> repaints<00:01:05.970> our<00:01:06.090> laziness

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
before I thought repaints our laziness

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.810 
before I thought repaints our laziness
on<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.290> part<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.530> Hauser<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:07.920> think<00:01:08.280> this<00:01:08.430> this

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
on the part of Hauser I think this this

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.179 
on the part of Hauser I think this this
has<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.360> lot<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:09.869> thought<00:01:10.200> put<00:01:10.229> into<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.680> when

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
has a lot of thought put into it when

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.010 
has a lot of thought put into it when
they<00:01:11.280> did<00:01:11.460> this<00:01:11.549> repaint<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.390> only<00:01:12.600> downside

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
they did this repaint the only downside

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.359 
they did this repaint the only downside
that<00:01:13.049> this<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.530> cannot<00:01:13.830> fold<00:01:14.100> the

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
that this is you cannot fold the

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.580 
that this is you cannot fold the
chainsaw<00:01:14.909> not<00:01:15.630> like<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.049> blur<00:01:16.290> figure<00:01:18.590> the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
chainsaw not like the blur figure the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.460 
chainsaw not like the blur figure the
only<00:01:19.650> way<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.420> get<00:01:21.420> rid<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.689> this<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:22.049> by

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
only way to get rid of this is by

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.109 
only way to get rid of this is by
literally<00:01:22.770> getting<00:01:23.040> rid<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.549> by

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
literally getting rid of it by

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.039 
literally getting rid of it by
unplugging<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.290> like<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.299> but<00:01:27.299> it's<00:01:27.479> it's<00:01:27.869> a

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
unplugging it like that but it's it's a

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.340 
unplugging it like that but it's it's a
pain<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.500> put<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:28.829> back<00:01:29.040> on<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.900> as<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.170> can

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
pain to put it back on and as you can

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:41.240 
pain to put it back on and as you can
see<00:01:32.600> very<00:01:33.600> difficult

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:49.080 

okay<00:01:46.890> it's<00:01:47.890> still<00:01:48.070> very<00:01:48.220> nice<00:01:48.520> even<00:01:48.880> with<00:01:49.000> the

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
okay it's still very nice even with the

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.150 
okay it's still very nice even with the
chainsaw<00:01:49.360> I<00:01:49.720> mean<00:01:49.930> I<00:01:50.020> I'd<00:01:50.410> like<00:01:50.590> to<00:01:50.710> keep<00:01:50.860> it<00:01:51.010> on

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.160 
chainsaw I mean I I'd like to keep it on

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.040 
chainsaw I mean I I'd like to keep it on

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
if I do display this in autumn owed the

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.260 
if I do display this in autumn owed the
chain<00:01:53.260> so<00:01:53.410> it's<00:01:53.530> got<00:01:53.650> me<00:01:53.830> on<00:01:54.000> stuff<00:01:55.000> locked

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
chain so it's got me on stuff locked

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.970 
chain so it's got me on stuff locked
down<00:01:55.450> on<00:01:55.600> the<00:01:55.720> other<00:01:55.870> hand<00:01:56.080> it's<00:01:56.500> still<00:01:56.710> a<00:01:56.740> very

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:56.980 
down on the other hand it's still a very

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.630 
down on the other hand it's still a very
good<00:01:57.220> figure<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:59.560> reason<00:01:59.890> I<00:01:59.950> like<00:02:00.160> it<00:02:00.190> is<00:02:00.370> not

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
good figure the reason I like it is not

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.850 
good figure the reason I like it is not
it's<00:02:00.880> not<00:02:01.120> entirely<00:02:01.510> transparent<00:02:01.990> a<00:02:02.470> lot<00:02:02.710> of

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
it's not entirely transparent a lot of

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.800 
it's not entirely transparent a lot of
the<00:02:02.980> plastic<00:02:03.460> on<00:02:03.580> it<00:02:03.640> a<00:02:03.940> lot<00:02:04.060> of<00:02:04.210> the<00:02:04.300> parts<00:02:04.510> are

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
the plastic on it a lot of the parts are

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.120 
the plastic on it a lot of the parts are
are<00:02:05.500> are<00:02:05.560> gray<00:02:06.280> or<00:02:06.640> opaque<00:02:07.830> you<00:02:08.830> get<00:02:08.979> the

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
are are gray or opaque you get the

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.940 
are are gray or opaque you get the

combination<00:02:17.560> for<00:02:18.210> this<00:02:19.210> figure<00:02:19.390> it<00:02:20.020> looks<00:02:20.230> as

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
combination for this figure it looks as

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.760 
combination for this figure it looks as
though<00:02:20.380> he's<00:02:20.650> just<00:02:20.890> decloaking<00:02:21.730> or<00:02:22.770> entering
