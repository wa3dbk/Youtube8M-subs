00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
it's kind of complicated at first but

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.870 
it's kind of complicated at first but
once<00:00:09.240> you<00:00:09.389> get<00:00:09.540> used<00:00:09.809> to<00:00:09.929> it<00:00:10.019> it<00:00:10.730> won't<00:00:11.730> be<00:00:11.849> that

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
once you get used to it it won't be that

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:19.070 
once you get used to it it won't be that
complicated<00:00:15.109> well<00:00:16.880> the<00:00:17.880> left-hand<00:00:18.449> part<00:00:18.779> is

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
complicated well the left-hand part is

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:26.260 
complicated well the left-hand part is
just<00:00:21.350> first<00:00:22.350> it's<00:00:23.160> just<00:00:23.640> a

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.270 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:32.290 

and<00:00:26.510> so<00:00:27.410> you<00:00:27.500> do<00:00:27.650> a<00:00:27.800> two<00:00:28.610> times<00:00:29.740> and<00:00:30.740> then<00:00:31.300> shift

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
and so you do a two times and then shift

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.770 
and so you do a two times and then shift
up<00:00:32.599> to<00:00:33.850> D<00:00:34.850> flat

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:54.440 

and<00:00:39.780> then<00:00:39.900> just<00:00:40.110> go<00:00:40.380> up<00:00:41.990> 12<00:00:42.990> d<00:00:53.150> and<00:00:54.150> then<00:00:54.360> you

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.450 
and then just go up 12 d and then you

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:05.850 
and then just go up 12 d and then you
just<00:00:54.660> go<00:00:54.870> up

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:13.080 

he<00:01:06.640> down<00:01:06.850> to<00:01:07.060> the<00:01:07.210> beat<00:01:07.800> so<00:01:09.930> now<00:01:11.670> now<00:01:12.670> I'd<00:01:12.850> let

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
he down to the beat so now now I'd let

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.260 
he down to the beat so now now I'd let
you<00:01:13.270> know<00:01:13.390> that<00:01:13.660> on<00:01:13.930> to<00:01:14.530> the<00:01:14.940> right-hand<00:01:15.940> part

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
you know that on to the right-hand part

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:29.630 
you know that on to the right-hand part
and<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:18.340> is<00:01:20.190> first<00:01:21.190> I<00:01:23.700> it's<00:01:24.700> just<00:01:24.970> see<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:27.280> a

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
and it is first I it's just see and a

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.020 
and it is first I it's just see and a
cap<00:01:30.640> told<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:32.140> have<00:01:32.290> to<00:01:32.500> do<00:01:32.650> a<00:01:32.860> the<00:01:33.250> whole<00:01:33.550> time

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
cap told you have to do a the whole time

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:47.820 
cap told you have to do a the whole time
and<00:01:34.570> so<00:01:35.170> it's<00:01:35.729> c<00:01:37.530> c<00:01:38.530> sharp<00:01:39.450> see<00:01:45.330> see<00:01:46.330> see<00:01:46.830> sharp

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
and so it's c c sharp see see see sharp

00:01:47.830 --> 00:02:00.330 
and so it's c c sharp see see see sharp
see<00:01:50.759> see<00:01:51.759> see<00:01:52.210> sharks<00:01:53.140> eat<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:56.350> then<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:59.380> so

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
see see see sharks eat and then and so

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:07.410 
see see see sharks eat and then and so
you<00:02:00.399> go<00:02:04.259> until<00:02:05.259> you<00:02:05.560> hope<00:02:06.009> do<00:02:06.580> one<00:02:06.940> so<00:02:07.240> you<00:02:07.300> can

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
you go until you hope do one so you can

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:16.640 
you go until you hope do one so you can
that<00:02:07.840> three<00:02:08.110> times<00:02:11.070> then<00:02:13.290> you<00:02:14.290> do<00:02:14.500> be

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
that three times then you do be

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:40.710 
that three times then you do be
and<00:02:17.040> then<00:02:17.299> C<00:02:18.299> sharp<00:02:20.329> and<00:02:21.329> so<00:02:21.900> altogether<00:02:22.890> it

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:49.240 

you

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.740 

then<00:02:50.250> when<00:02:50.430> you<00:02:50.520> get<00:02:50.640> better<00:02:50.880> at<00:02:51.090> it<00:02:51.120> you<00:02:51.450> do<00:02:51.720> it

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
then when you get better at it you do it

00:02:51.750 --> 00:03:02.759 
then when you get better at it you do it
a<00:02:51.900> little<00:02:52.080> faster

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:02.769 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:07.089 

and<00:03:03.769> now<00:03:04.000> through<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:05.090> middle<00:03:05.390> bridge<00:03:06.099> which

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
and now through the middle bridge which

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:13.690 
and now through the middle bridge which
is<00:03:07.310> pretty<00:03:07.519> easy<00:03:07.819> you<00:03:08.239> just<00:03:08.989> do<00:03:09.879> so<00:03:10.879> she<00:03:10.939> do<00:03:12.700> you

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
is pretty easy you just do so she do you

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:33.569 
is pretty easy you just do so she do you
