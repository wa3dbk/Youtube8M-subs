00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.609
 personal state of life power line 

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:14.019
 Through the centuries humanity was building with what it found 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:17.529
 reach of the hand for the young brown matilde there 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:22.839
 over the centuries the construction was moving towards a style that uses 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:24.970
 almost mechanically already denounced 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:25.940
 iron 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.829
 cement and concrete 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:32.909
 however a low percentage of humanity is returning towards a 

00:00:32.909 --> 00:00:37.860
 construction style using natural materials as in the beginning 

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:43.449
 looking in this way to lower the environmental impact in line with a new 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:48.360
 way of life in which the care of the environment is paramount 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.810
 what we are doing is traditional architecture as a measure 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:55.400
 nothing 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.400
 this 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:02.550
 modern as dame we call him we do not know well yet 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.970
 what is happening with this construction in the health of the people 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.180
 we have some data like for example 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.600
 the garbage quarry that is generated in the world 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.580
 we also have the energy expenditure data that is generated for 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.180
 produce certain houses 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.440
 and with construction 13 the stone earth construction of 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.200
 wood 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.770
 this we have a great impact 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.580
 ecological west is what is built with what you have percent in the 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.090
 surroundings of from your house of your future home not 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.859
 the second most important factor after the burning of 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.970
 of fossil remains of love of del petrolí all that in the industry of the 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:40.980
 cement 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.980
 and although today still in Argentina you can still see 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.780
 as something 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.150
 it's something weird something jipi 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.930
 on the planet in the world 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:52.850
 this 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.180
 it's a trend that is left to assume a lot of strength is 40 years ago 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.330
 least 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.819
 the countries that we call percent 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:04.149
 of the first world assumes that France Canada United States 

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:08.299
 retakes the tradition of building with land 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:11.479
 begins to grow again 

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:15.119
 because you can take the constructions of the past and put all the 

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:18.430
 technology be green from the architect and sheep engineer 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.499
 when we are going to work with mud with earth 

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:26.809
 the mixtures we replace the cement by clay which is the binder that sticks and 

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:32.519
 the rest are in that is the land that one is used while being in a city and 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.959
 you want to build you can simply buy clay or compare sand if you 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.040
 you are in rural areas you are looking for the land that leaves your surroundings 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.350
 and after some tests you can directly build with it in the 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.990
 Currently there are different techniques here 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:53.670
 to build the houses applying the use of natural materials 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:56.469
 will go for example 

00:02:56.469 --> 00:02:58.129
 this is one 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:59.469
 we have wood 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:01.059
 ibarra 

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:04.049
 on the other side you also have wood and clay 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:05.749
 on the other side of wood 

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:07.869
 here we have the peace couple 

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:12.199
 this has a 3 percent revoke assumes a first one that called it a primer 

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:13.840
 that the one who sealed the bale 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.080
 a second resource a 2 thick plaster the thin third 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.359
 and a painting 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:22.049
 to the lime below we have again the wall bales of grass 

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:27.549
 and above we have a technique that was called Bahrain that normally a 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.549
 technique than the traditional one of the northern Argentine c 

00:03:31.279 --> 00:03:36.029
 back there a lattice of yours grab them let's tell the truth yours 

00:03:36.029 --> 00:03:37.399
 harder than I had 

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:38.750
 I made the whole wall 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.549
 sharp with wires yes 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:44.810
 and then revoke has a very low cost so that they have an idea one 

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:46.729
 family can be a house 

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:50.879
 more than worthy for 10 thousand pesos you can make a square house a house 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:53.659
 rectangular with a house 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:55.580
 as we say what happens 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.779
 the same the terminations because in the straight house that of love that the plasters 

00:04:00.779 --> 00:04:04.359
 the boss to each other and you never find out it's a dirt house 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:06.889
 ou completions pulseadas 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:10.669
 Cuba and people that I directly said to the land and the grass city so that it 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:11.700
 see little longer 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:12.760
 the aesthetic anguish 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.639
 after the same the facilities as water light gas and are conventional no no 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:20.370
 he finds out that he fears some 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.710
 minimum technical precautions percent but 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.999
 they all get inside the 

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:27.809
 there is no weird thing 

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:32.479
 We agree that when you work with soil you work with greater thickness 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:34.710
 that we are usually working 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.710
 suppose that the houses that I do have a thickness is 50 centimeters 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.460
 parents do not 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.229
 then you have a thermal illation that you produce in summer 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:50.509
 a free air conditioner and understand arno any minimum heating 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:54.909
 is inside the house and producing an interesting form that other countries 

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:58.309
 It is not allowed to know how we built here for three days in 

00:04:58.309 --> 00:04:59.189
 thermal no 

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:04.759
 monex - the correct day not only a wall of 40 to 50 centimeters admits 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:10.189
 we would go percent that you do not decide and define is the heat then 

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:11.650
 maintains 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.060
 the ambient relative humidity between 50 and 60 percent 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.059
 year round housing 

00:05:17.059 --> 00:05:20.569
 which is the humidity that the airways need to have 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:25.360
 a state or perfect health are not very interesting from germany there 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.780
 a hospital built with land percent of pathway disease 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.050
 respiratory by this topic for example not 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.569
 ground bath 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:35.469
 It is more hygienic companion tiles 

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:40.079
 gieco just do not have humidity you do not have to drive after a 

00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:42.130
 hot shower you do not have left 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.820
 mediator to the bathroom fogged but quickly the walls absorb smd 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:46.979
 who return it later 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:49.370
 this is noticed that we go do not have humidity there is a 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.830
 Several possibilities to solve what is the intermediate part do not tell you anything 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.349
 what he used a lot because age of an optimal result and almost what 

00:05:59.349 --> 00:06:04.009
 get cheap is the flaxseed oil is not an oil that is painted the wall is 

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:06.719
 paint the clay or paint a paint 

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:09.740
 and it's that waterproof bugs theme 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.889
 the answer is that he does not have bugs 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:15.249
 then instead of raising the quality level of people's lives directly 

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:17.409
 the dover ranch was abolished 

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:18.610
 attacking 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.210
 today you know who does not pass anything with that 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:27.139
 in the north you have houses with wood or material i 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:31.180
 i have all vinchucas let's say nothing and the vinchuca validated tinelli diet 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.660
 where it has fissures does not question finished house 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:37.970
 pintadita with latex was going to have 20 his house so for those who feel like 

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:42.810
 of building this beyond what it is they are encouraged to forget about the subject of what 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:45.530
 that's why there is no you can do a bounce 

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.710
 perfectly neither sofía and no 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:51.520
 paint it and they will not have any difference with any house
