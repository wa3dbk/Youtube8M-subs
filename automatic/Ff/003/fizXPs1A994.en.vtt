00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:08.870
 On the day when you can not drink it without drinking it 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:16.110
 Last February 25th 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:18.439
 While the monk Wakwang went out for a while, the guests who did not invite him 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.439
 I'm here. 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:28.820
 09:47 Buddhist monks Iljin 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:33.920
 I'm a handicapped person in a car rambo . 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:40.670
 The monks who visited Gyung-Am , 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:45.980
 I've been looking for the seventeen kinds of hermits, sharing cars in their fifth generation . 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:48.020
 As well as being the headquarters of Owau 4 , the headquarters of Gyeonggangam, 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.980
 It was included in sour 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:56.150
 Guests who have come out without contact 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:01:01.420
 I put Huca wreaths in the courtyard. 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.420
 I've been putting out an appointment with a strange name . 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:10.550
 He then informed me that the owner of the stomach cancer has changed. 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.550
 He dismissed the Red Monk . 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:22.720
 2 I am. The monk's tenure is still three years away. 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:27.880
 So I asked the 17 monks who came to the hermitage. 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:30.790
 To keep myself enough times per palm party with a sense of cancer was once the acquisition 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.610
 Because 1 gold meets the word, 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:38.329
 We have not called Jean celebration 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:43.610
 This is a typical low- force law. 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:49.570
 17: 1 The conversation from the beginning was impossible. 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:52.780
 I do not give a peaceful way atda does not listen even if he would come up spot 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.840
 I do not think he's going to compete. 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:59.009
 We can not be in May 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.009
 Do not pack anything. 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:10.820
 However, on that day, the monk, 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:15.730
 I crossed the white envelope from the monk . 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.730
 I will not go. 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:27.320
 Would it have jeokgeon monk guessed was in the envelope 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:28.340
 That nanwojun the envelope of the questions to which the monk headquarters in oheosa share of the arm 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.910
 It is 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.910
 For evenly 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.070
 we now 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:46.460
 One touches 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:49.820
 The whole thing is sobbing oheosa Protocol bakkwimyeonseo gotta give it a term 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:53.680
 I'm satisfied with that also happened to fellowship with jajangam 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.680
 It's a funny greeting move. 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:05.410
 Thank you for helping us take over the transfer. I just gave it to the monks. 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:09.280
 We have 0 plants that give birth to us. 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:16.000
 The resilience is still in the shape of a cheap 100,000 years 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:21.120
 Why did the monk go out when he went out of his way? 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.350
 It is therefore not in a small hermitage monks visited let the 17 people appointed by the FIG. 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:33.500
 I'm curious. 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:40.180
 What does this interpretation ah cool flying lead'll be like now, 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:40.180
 Since then my red light monk has the right by unwanted and believers 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:49.520
 I'm very interested in general thinking and I have not been doing anything . 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:55.340
 It's not the same Spirit . 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:58.850
 k3 serious campers, if not life heroine is not what Mr forces 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:01.970
 The believers miss the bandit miner . 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:07.900
 The water brings water to the hermit among the precious mountains. 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.900
 This is because he is a red-light monk 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:15.600
 The scenery of this once peaceful place has changed 180 degrees since that day . 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:23.120
 It's okay to go to the original place. 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:29.360
 I ate something like this. 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:35.320
 It was not only the owner in the hermitage that the guests who came to visit Jigangam that day changed. 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:39.040
 I thought it was time to ride on it Now I was so scared Yes oo 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.040
 It's raw material. 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.890
 I'm friendly. 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:52.610
 If you think only day still tremble Shinto 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:55.910
 That is why the fear that permeated the place to be full of Chaya picked by virtue of the Buddha 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:05:00.050
 What is light 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:04.160
 The answer is that I was in a phone call to myself a while back. 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:06.759
 The monk Wakwang claims to already have many things in the end , 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.759
 It's possible
