shanky a hook like this the hook point

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.320 
shanky a hook like this the hook point
comes<00:01:33.940> out<00:01:34.150> the<00:01:34.810> head<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:36.340> other<00:01:36.460> hook<00:01:36.820> and

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
comes out the head the other hook and

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.000 
comes out the head the other hook and
you're<00:01:37.479> not<00:01:37.659> goes<00:01:38.050> into<00:01:38.080> the<00:01:38.500> tail<00:01:38.710> there

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
you're not goes into the tail there

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.770 
you're not goes into the tail there
which<00:01:39.220> help<00:01:39.520> prevent<00:01:39.820> it<00:01:40.090> slipping<00:01:40.570> them<00:01:40.659> and

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
which help prevent it slipping them and

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:41.730 
which help prevent it slipping them and
that's<00:01:40.900> not<00:01:41.020> really<00:01:41.260> going<00:01:41.380> to<00:01:41.470> move<00:01:41.590> anywhere

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
that's not really going to move anywhere

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.130 
that's not really going to move anywhere
now<00:01:42.070> that's<00:01:42.220> pretty<00:01:42.430> solid<00:01:42.900> and<00:01:43.900> there<00:01:44.049> you

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
now that's pretty solid and there you

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.210 
now that's pretty solid and there you
have<00:01:44.200> I<00:01:44.530> mean<00:01:44.560> that's<00:01:44.770> a<00:01:44.860> brilliant

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
have I mean that's a brilliant

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.820 
have I mean that's a brilliant
presentation<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:47.170> can<00:01:47.290> fish<00:01:47.470> it<00:01:47.590> out<00:01:47.650> with<00:01:47.710> a

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
presentation you can fish it out with a

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.649 
presentation you can fish it out with a
little<00:01:47.890> split<00:01:48.310> shot<00:01:48.520> where<00:01:48.760> that<00:01:49.299> helps<00:01:49.570> it

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
little split shot where that helps it

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.810 
little split shot where that helps it
sink<00:01:49.930> sort<00:01:50.500> of<00:01:50.560> like<00:01:50.710> this<00:01:50.890> which<00:01:51.100> is<00:01:51.280> quite

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
sink sort of like this which is quite

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.000 
sink sort of like this which is quite
often<00:01:51.970> out<00:01:52.240> of<00:01:52.630> problems<00:01:53.020> will<00:01:53.409> move<00:01:53.620> you<00:01:53.890> can

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.010 
often out of problems will move you can

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.730 
often out of problems will move you can
bounce<00:01:54.250> it<00:01:54.369> across<00:01:54.580> the<00:01:54.729> bottom<00:01:54.880> and<00:01:55.710> like<00:01:56.710> I

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
bounce it across the bottom and like I

Weymouth the guys at Weymouth fishing on

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.140 
Weymouth the guys at Weymouth fishing on
the<00:02:52.840> shambles<00:02:53.230> use<00:02:53.890> these<00:02:54.160> all<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:54.940> time

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
the shambles use these all the time

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.500 
the shambles use these all the time
during<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:55.660> summer<00:02:55.810> and<00:02:56.230> autumn<00:02:56.380> for<00:02:57.220> place

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
during the summer and autumn for place

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.680 
during the summer and autumn for place
so<00:02:58.510> you<00:02:58.709> imagine<00:02:59.709> a<00:03:00.040> thread<00:03:00.430> couple<00:03:01.390> of<00:03:01.450> three

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
so you imagine a thread couple of three

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.949 
so you imagine a thread couple of three
ragworm<00:03:02.200> up<00:03:02.380> there<00:03:02.590> up<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.400> hooks<00:03:03.580> node<00:03:03.959> then

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
ragworm up there up the hooks node then

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.320 
ragworm up there up the hooks node then
all<00:03:05.049> you<00:03:05.170> need<00:03:05.200> to<00:03:05.410> do<00:03:05.590> all<00:03:06.489> they<00:03:06.640> do<00:03:06.700> is<00:03:07.120> just

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
all you need to do all they do is just

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.789 
all you need to do all they do is just
literally<00:03:07.569> pass<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:08.110> hook<00:03:08.260> through<00:03:08.530> once

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
literally pass the hook through once

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:10.710 
literally pass the hook through once
like<00:03:09.310> that<00:03:09.340> and<00:03:09.970> then<00:03:10.090> put<00:03:10.239> a<00:03:10.269> load<00:03:10.450> along

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
like that and then put a load along

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.160 
like that and then put a load along
trimming<00:03:11.380> strip<00:03:12.190> of<00:03:12.340> squid<00:03:12.580> and<00:03:12.989> there's<00:03:13.989> your

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
trimming strip of squid and there's your

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.259 
trimming strip of squid and there's your
place<00:03:14.380> by<00:03:14.620> it<00:03:14.680> is<00:03:14.860> absolutely<00:03:15.640> deadly<00:03:15.880> that's

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
place by it is absolutely deadly that's

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.380 
place by it is absolutely deadly that's
what<00:03:17.260> a<00:03:17.290> lot<00:03:17.530> of<00:03:17.560> these<00:03:17.709> five<00:03:18.580> and<00:03:18.819> six<00:03:19.060> or<00:03:19.269> even

what a lot of these five and six or even

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.270 
what a lot of these five and six or even
seven<00:03:19.540> pound<00:03:20.170> place<00:03:20.380> that<00:03:20.739> are<00:03:20.860> being<00:03:21.010> caught

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
down of the mussel beds down at Weymouth

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.949 
down of the mussel beds down at Weymouth
this<00:03:24.190> is<00:03:24.519> one<00:03:25.120> of<00:03:25.150> the<00:03:25.299> reasons<00:03:25.630> why<00:03:25.780> they're

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
this is one of the reasons why they're

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.900 
this is one of the reasons why they're
being<00:03:26.079> cool<00:03:26.459> don't<00:03:27.459> get<00:03:27.549> me<00:03:27.640> wrong<00:03:27.670> you're

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
being cool don't get me wrong you're

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.840 
being cool don't get me wrong you're
still<00:03:28.209> catch<00:03:28.420> place<00:03:28.690> on<00:03:29.019> the<00:03:29.370> traditional<00:03:30.370> rag

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
still catch place on the traditional rag

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.080 
still catch place on the traditional rag
women<00:03:31.239> squid<00:03:31.600> setup<00:03:31.989> but<00:03:32.859> this<00:03:33.070> for<00:03:33.940> some

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
women squid setup but this for some

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.449 
women squid setup but this for some
reason<00:03:34.120> is<00:03:34.690> just<00:03:35.440> adds<00:03:35.620> another<00:03:35.739> dimension

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
reason is just adds another dimension

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:37.740 
reason is just adds another dimension
and<00:03:36.579> it<00:03:36.670> really<00:03:36.850> does<00:03:37.060> increase<00:03:37.239> your<00:03:37.480> catch

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
and it really does increase your catch

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.660 
and it really does increase your catch
rate<00:03:38.049> so<00:03:38.709> if<00:03:38.859> you<00:03:38.980> carry<00:03:39.160> over<00:03:39.220> go<00:03:39.430> for<00:03:39.609> the

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
rate so if you carry over go for the

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.390 
rate so if you carry over go for the
places<00:03:40.090> summer<00:03:40.359> or<00:03:40.600> autumn<00:03:41.400> especially
