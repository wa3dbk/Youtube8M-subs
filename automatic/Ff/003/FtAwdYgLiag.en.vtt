00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.449
 Hi, we often have another cabin 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.510
 throw it fringe waist stretches with 

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:16.580
 much speed before teaching how 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.250
 you can cut a bang without 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.920
 creating big problems in reality is 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:26.530
 much easier than you think yes 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:29.630
 sees the central part this way 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:33.800
 helped you help by resting your hand 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:38.300
 in the person's tape cut the 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.649
 first section you never get up 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.039
 to the last phalanx because otherwise 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:45.710
 you risk to cut yourself then continue 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:47.960
 in this way 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.469
 a mistake that is often made is to continue 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:54.559
 of the two sides and so in reality the two sides 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:57.319
 they should be taken to their own center 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.389
 because these two points must be 

00:00:57.319 --> 00:01:01.940
 longer in this case already were 

00:00:59.389 --> 00:01:06.020
 have been cut enough so that there is 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:13.640
 we will give a little room here is here 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:17.030
 here instead we find more length in it 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.969
 we have our france 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:23.710
 I would add to give more lines to the 

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:28.460
 Truly trimming of banality 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:33.310
 I would take a break I would go to the side 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:36.259
 of the hair at ear level 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.679
 this way and I would just go to 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:42.289
 slip so that we create some 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:45.729
 this scaling we do not have the coast 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:48.649
 same thing here at the height 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:53.149
 of the beginning of the ear we take 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:55.789
 always the section here is a slight one 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:57.859
 very light scaling because if 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:00.560
 let's go deeper 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:03.439
 we will cut more rebels then with two 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:08.409
 moves we created a france that a 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.409
 little scaling in front that does not hurt
