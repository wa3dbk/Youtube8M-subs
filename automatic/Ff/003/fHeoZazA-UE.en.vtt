00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:03.029
 v 

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.810
 christine produces today the idea as soon as there is a little more 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:12.849
 the application recently few 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:16.029
 on the phone can application here 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.909
 so that allows to 

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:21.539
 to do a lot of things in suede even that of playing that's all 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:22.429
 simply 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:26.489
 so here is so to start% you can see it you must you 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:27.919
 identify in section 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:31.509
 a meeting because we say very happy that it was until now a 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:33.510
 current structure to illustrate 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.450
 but he chooses in the conflict 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:36.850
 in any case 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.470
 So here you have to choose your character 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.030
 so for six months I'll take my character 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.900
 I'm a little con that I took a lot of people because the 17 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.130
 why not around said common stressing that features 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.960
 no it's against how how do i want to see you more clearly a conflict 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.370
 all the mail 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.920
 he quotes prospecting it's a cigarette for opinion 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.120
 by a cold sequel you stated that pekin details lived the 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.160
 events 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.390
 indeed 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.530
 in other words, the colors 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.750
 if you have a doubt no matter who is always helpful 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.300
 remember October 31 a little more than you say 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.150
 so we see that twitter harmony and all equipment 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.710
 probably the same 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.220
 in the description 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.220
 points + 34 years old I am the record 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.560
 to guard against it the judge claude parent show because a small mini 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.880
 profit over one year 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.300
 on an outdated niqab 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.350
 in your store that's very very useful 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.380
 your store is for them 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.120
 to pass the convoy of goods 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.020
 since the defeat to clermont shot of the ceni 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.580
 the equipment that I already had on sale me 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.050
 provide 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.800
 to lavaur fleeing rescuers 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.060
 designed in the list of friends have that's where you will be able to 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.720
 dialogue so 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.240
 spoil yourself skeptically there the facts is comparing your friends who 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.240
 compete through the employment pole m 

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:14.449
 Her arrival 

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:18.709
 we will learn if the answering machine 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.750
 waiting for my team mate I'm looking for 

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:27.199
 m 

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:30.199
 we will not see you answering the requests to the young people 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:34.189
 so why want to listen to them 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:38.889
 mood a lot proportion of content and take earlier 

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:42.689
 my coach to kill is to talk so if you want to take someone who 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:45.409
 is not in your friends you do a little bit of susic 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:48.759
 so the name of the character why 

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:52.249
 so here is then divided it's to see the members of segi obviously 

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:53.409
 quite simply 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:55.439
 the person is counted 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:59.479
 we could see 14 centers 46 it's not the number of goals 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:01.929
 it's like my own website 

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:05.269
 fourteen the number of members and 46 and not a maximum 

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:08.369
 holding that I can have 

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:11.339
 and if you are wonderfully like me 

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:14.339
 for example you take any brand 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.429
 w 

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:20.139
 and r I can very well cost them more rights to couples 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:23.139
 we can not swear the hen 6 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.419
 so that's so 

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:31.419
 then there is the encyclopedia so be reassured 

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:35.749
 marseillan that this Guinean people who is talking about a return to disarm 

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:40.209
 you have here all the price all the inks so much to take for example 

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:45.359
 you see everything so it takes three 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:48.359
 a baguette 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:52.409
 I find 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:55.409
 we will come to find here are three levels 

00:03:55.999 --> 00:03:59.400
 all the information on this wand his disappointment of the item 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:01.629
 the effects 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:03.599
 those who love you 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.599
 that's a lot of them saw very handy 

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:10.719
 so then so much following in the 

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:13.719
 the icons we have corporate servers 

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:17.449
 the list of servers which for example but badly 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:19.529
 eyi 

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:24.680
 my side legalize its vast of a very great utility you sad amuse 

00:04:24.679 --> 00:04:26.430
 what we did 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.060
 the ranking so the ranking the muc 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.870
 however, how 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.870
 when you get back your character name 

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:41.550
 it is searched 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:44.620
 so I'm not yet referenced in the drinking leader 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:45.979
 honda 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:49.349
 we tried with my friend the embedded 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:52.349
 the Romans 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.449
 so that's their bars in my friend 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:02.969
 and then why 

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:06.460
 so we'll have access to all 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.419
 we are folded 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:11.319
 it is party research 

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:13.830
 then land art 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.059
 in all about to castigate 199 

00:05:17.059 --> 00:05:20.139
 thousandths bourque here is a lot of rank 2 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.080
 rather nice with or nothing the plutocracy of access why it's 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.289
 happy 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:29.229
 that's why here for the ranking 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:32.229
 so that we owe back on Friday as 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:38.020
 and the price remains the couple we pray that me me I take for whom for what 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.400
 we will see 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.839
 I realize that this app 

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:44.089
 so what to turn the wheel 

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:47.089
 a sport 

00:05:55.369 --> 00:05:56.969
 but here is the 

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:59.909
 chugai slap what brings up there 

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:01.369
 a record there 

00:06:01.369 --> 00:06:04.349
 I won something to prepare 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:07.539
 so I think we did the trick in application 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:11.020
 free to download on the appstore simply 

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:13.569
 so that you could 

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:17.870
 even very very good application that can serve a lack of respect 

00:06:17.869 --> 00:06:18.979
 evening 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:21.199
 to plead king is 

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:24.139
 it was hot for the help times production we are going to visit 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:25.729
 machine and youtube 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:28.360
 for that guys on 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.550
 do you understand youtube content 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.220
 why the character elections production you see here so more 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.110
 coquets free simply 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.110
