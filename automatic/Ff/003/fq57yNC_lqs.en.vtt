Oh

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.110 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.990 

hi<00:00:12.110> I'm<00:00:12.349> Helen<00:00:12.769> Morelle<00:00:12.980> from<00:00:13.280> Vetri<00:00:13.670> thermal

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.000 
hi I'm Helen Morelle from Vetri thermal

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.699 
hi I'm Helen Morelle from Vetri thermal
imaging<00:00:14.360> and<00:00:14.750> we're<00:00:15.110> going<00:00:15.260> to<00:00:15.320> talk<00:00:15.559> about

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:15.709 
imaging and we're going to talk about

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:17.380 
imaging and we're going to talk about
how<00:00:16.010> you<00:00:16.070> can<00:00:16.279> use<00:00:16.460> thermal<00:00:16.849> imaging<00:00:17.180> to<00:00:17.360> look

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
how you can use thermal imaging to look

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.320 
how you can use thermal imaging to look
at<00:00:17.660> leg<00:00:18.140> injuries<00:00:18.730> so<00:00:19.730> I'm<00:00:19.820> with<00:00:19.970> thermal

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330 
at leg injuries so I'm with thermal

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:22.359 
at leg injuries so I'm with thermal
imaging<00:00:20.689> legs<00:00:20.960> we<00:00:21.410> need<00:00:21.560> to<00:00:21.680> capture<00:00:21.950> all

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
imaging legs we need to capture all

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:24.670 
imaging legs we need to capture all
views<00:00:22.789> of<00:00:23.060> all<00:00:23.210> of<00:00:23.390> the<00:00:23.509> major<00:00:23.689> anatomical

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680 
views of all of the major anatomical

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.650 
views of all of the major anatomical
areas<00:00:25.070> of<00:00:25.220> the<00:00:25.310> leg<00:00:25.490> so<00:00:25.759> you<00:00:26.270> look<00:00:26.419> at<00:00:26.570> the

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
areas of the leg so you look at the

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.620 
areas of the leg so you look at the
major<00:00:26.840> joints<00:00:27.559> tendons<00:00:28.489> the<00:00:28.939> ligaments<00:00:29.480> and

the skeleton the bones that are making

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.330 
the skeleton the bones that are making
up<00:00:31.730> the<00:00:31.759> leg<00:00:32.090> we<00:00:33.079> compare<00:00:33.500> the<00:00:33.739> left<00:00:33.950> and<00:00:34.280> the

thermal symmetry we're looking to make

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.119 
thermal symmetry we're looking to make
sure<00:00:38.390> that<00:00:38.870> the<00:00:38.960> same<00:00:39.140> amount<00:00:39.469> of<00:00:39.620> blood<00:00:39.860> is

it isn't if there's more or less than
you'd<00:00:45.920> normally<00:00:45.949> expect<00:00:46.640> to<00:00:46.699> see<00:00:46.999> that<00:00:47.809> can

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
you'd normally expect to see that can

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.669 
you'd normally expect to see that can
indicate<00:00:48.649> an<00:00:48.980> underlying<00:00:49.070> problem<00:00:50.499> so<00:00:51.499> this

00:00:51.669 --> 00:00:51.679 
indicate an underlying problem so this

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:53.500 
indicate an underlying problem so this
thoroughbreds<00:00:52.280> thermal<00:00:52.789> image<00:00:53.030> we<00:00:53.359> can

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
thoroughbreds thermal image we can

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.439 
thoroughbreds thermal image we can
clearly<00:00:53.839> see<00:00:54.199> that<00:00:54.559> he's<00:00:54.859> been<00:00:55.129> pin<00:00:55.489> fired<00:00:55.789> you

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
clearly see that he's been pin fired you

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:57.819 
clearly see that he's been pin fired you
can<00:00:56.600> see<00:00:56.749> the<00:00:56.899> marks<00:00:57.230> that<00:00:57.319> have<00:00:57.409> been<00:00:57.589> left

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829 
can see the marks that have been left

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.399 
can see the marks that have been left
from<00:00:58.039> that<00:00:58.280> procedure<00:00:58.989> thermal<00:00:59.989> imaging<00:01:00.260> is<00:01:00.379> a

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:00.409 
from that procedure thermal imaging is a

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:02.619 
from that procedure thermal imaging is a
really<00:01:00.859> useful<00:01:01.159> tool<00:01:01.429> for<00:01:02.149> monitoring

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
really useful tool for monitoring

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.200 
really useful tool for monitoring
tendons<00:01:03.229> and<00:01:03.409> ligaments<00:01:03.769> and<00:01:04.070> can<00:01:04.820> highlight

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
tendons and ligaments and can highlight

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.270 
tendons and ligaments and can highlight
problems<00:01:05.750> up<00:01:05.900> to<00:01:06.020> two<00:01:06.200> weeks<00:01:06.440> before<00:01:06.860> they

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
problems up to two weeks before they

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.640 
problems up to two weeks before they
become<00:01:07.580> clinically<00:01:08.000> evidence<00:01:08.650> possibly

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
become clinically evidence possibly

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.200 
become clinically evidence possibly
avoiding<00:01:10.100> the<00:01:10.159> need<00:01:10.280> to<00:01:10.340> pin<00:01:10.670> fire<00:01:10.970> in<00:01:11.120> the

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
avoiding the need to pin fire in the

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.200 
avoiding the need to pin fire in the
future<00:01:11.710> so<00:01:12.710> some<00:01:12.890> routine<00:01:13.340> thermal<00:01:13.909> imaging

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:16.399 
of this fillies foreleg actually

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:18.969 
of this fillies foreleg actually
highlighted<00:01:17.000> a<00:01:17.060> really<00:01:17.420> extreme<00:01:17.899> hot<00:01:18.259> spot<00:01:18.649> in

highlighted a really extreme hot spot in
the<00:01:19.610> past<00:01:19.880> and<00:01:20.149> it<00:01:20.930> was<00:01:21.049> immediately<00:01:21.530> referred

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
the past and it was immediately referred

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.010 
the past and it was immediately referred
to<00:01:22.070> the<00:01:22.189> VEX<00:01:22.430> who<00:01:22.850> took<00:01:23.090> some<00:01:23.270> x-rays<00:01:23.659> and<00:01:23.689> that

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
to the VEX who took some x-rays and that

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.260 
to the VEX who took some x-rays and that
she<00:01:24.229> identified<00:01:24.860> a<00:01:24.890> bone<00:01:25.369> cyst<00:01:25.759> at<00:01:25.909> a<00:01:26.000> very

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
she identified a bone cyst at a very

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.420 
she identified a bone cyst at a very
very<00:01:26.539> early<00:01:26.869> stage<00:01:27.200> of<00:01:27.680> development

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
very early stage of development

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.749 
very early stage of development
this<00:01:29.210> meant<00:01:29.479> that<00:01:29.860> pinhole<00:01:30.860> surgery<00:01:31.399> could<00:01:31.670> be

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
this meant that pinhole surgery could be

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.230 
this meant that pinhole surgery could be
undertaken<00:01:32.000> immediately<00:01:32.689> and<00:01:33.259> the<00:01:33.770> prognosis

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
undertaken immediately and the prognosis

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.520 
undertaken immediately and the prognosis
absolutely<00:01:35.240> excellent<00:01:35.509> now<00:01:35.780> no<00:01:36.289> bone

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
grafting was needed and this video just

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.899 
grafting was needed and this video just
has<00:01:39.020> a<00:01:39.049> one<00:01:39.320> centimeter<00:01:39.770> scar<00:01:40.250> to<00:01:40.490> show<00:01:40.700> for
