a<00:00:44.789> week<00:00:45.570> after<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.079> followed<00:00:46.620> up<00:00:46.739> with<00:00:46.770> the

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
a week after that I followed up with the

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.150 
a week after that I followed up with the
clinic<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.020> they<00:00:49.020> check<00:00:49.469> my<00:00:49.500> progesterone

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
clinic and they check my progesterone

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.760 
clinic and they check my progesterone
levels<00:00:50.879> which<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.210> basically<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.840> hormone<00:00:52.530> that

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
levels which is basically a hormone that

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.549 
levels which is basically a hormone that
in<00:00:53.129> your<00:00:53.309> uterus<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:54.449> allows<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.379> egg<00:00:55.530> to

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
in your uterus that allows the egg to

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.580 
in your uterus that allows the egg to
implant<00:00:56.280> in<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.640> uterus<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.360> they<00:00:58.230> said<00:00:58.440> my

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
implant in the uterus and they said my

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.729 
implant in the uterus and they said my
progesterone<00:00:58.980> levels<00:00:59.609> were<00:00:59.789> low<00:01:00.590> so<00:01:01.590> they

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
progesterone levels were low so they

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.750 
progesterone levels were low so they
gave<00:01:01.949> me<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:03.530> vaginal<00:01:04.530> suppository<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.369> use

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
gave me a vaginal suppository to use

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.890 
gave me a vaginal suppository to use
which<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.390> didn't<00:01:06.990> use<00:01:08.150> just<00:01:09.150> because<00:01:09.510> usually

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
which I didn't use just because usually

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.780 
which I didn't use just because usually

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
progesterone levels are regulated by

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.859 
progesterone levels are regulated by
your<00:01:17.100> menstrual<00:01:17.460> cycle<00:01:17.939> so<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.119> already<00:01:18.390> felt

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
your menstrual cycle so I already felt

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.499

like<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:19.439> wasn't<00:01:20.009> pregnant<00:01:20.340> so<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:20.939> didn't<00:01:21.360> want

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
like I wasn't pregnant so I didn't want

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.219

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
to use the suppositories they gave when

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.980 
to use the suppositories they gave when
I<00:01:25.259> researched<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.729> medication<00:01:27.420> there

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
suppository it's just in case the

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.320 
suppository it's just in case the
progesterone<00:03:31.170> level<00:03:31.740> is<00:03:31.830> low<00:03:32.070> which<00:03:32.970> I'm

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.110 
hard-headed I'm not going to do oh and I
think<00:03:36.570> one<00:03:36.810> thing<00:03:36.840> is<00:03:37.340> you<00:03:38.340> have<00:03:38.370> to<00:03:38.790> do<00:03:38.940> your

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
think one thing is you have to do your

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.820 
think one thing is you have to do your
own<00:03:39.180> research<00:03:39.360> just<00:03:40.200> like<00:03:40.380> with<00:03:40.560> anything

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
own research just like with anything

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.850 
own research just like with anything
else<00:03:41.190> yes<00:03:42.150> they<00:03:42.480> are<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:43.020> doctors<00:03:43.470> and<00:03:43.500> they

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
else yes they are the doctors and they

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.700 
else yes they are the doctors and they
are<00:03:44.040> the<00:03:44.460> sort<00:03:45.300> of<00:03:45.390> speed<00:03:45.690> industry<00:03:46.560> experts

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:46.710 
are the sort of speed industry experts

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.070 
are the sort of speed industry experts
but<00:03:47.700> you<00:03:47.850> still<00:03:47.910> really<00:03:48.360> have<00:03:48.630> to<00:03:48.750> do<00:03:48.870> your<00:03:49.020> own

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
but you still really have to do your own

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.560 
but you still really have to do your own
research<00:03:49.230> and<00:03:50.010> you<00:03:50.250> know<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:50.910> bottom<00:03:51.090> line<00:03:51.240> is

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
research and you know the bottom line is

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.750 
research and you know the bottom line is
just<00:03:51.780> your<00:03:52.020> body<00:03:52.230> you<00:03:52.740> have<00:03:52.890> to<00:03:53.040> decide<00:03:53.370> what

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
just your body you have to decide what

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.350

you will won't intake we did research on

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.030 
you will won't intake we did research on
the<00:03:57.480> suppositories<00:03:58.140> and<00:03:58.170> we<00:03:58.440> just<00:03:58.650> you<00:03:58.980> know

the suppositories and we just you know

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.730 
the suppositories and we just you know
felt<00:03:59.340> like<00:03:59.610> we<00:04:00.540> decided<00:04:01.080> not<00:04:01.230> to<00:04:01.290> do<00:04:01.590> them

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:01.740 
felt like we decided not to do them
