00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.129
 hello good today how usual are we here 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.259
 in a new video and we're here in the 

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:09.960
 challenges because we are the challenges 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.300
 because I'm going to show you how to put them in 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.760
 english on playstation 4 how to get in 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.580
 English to show up down there 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.619
 the restrictions that requirements of 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.020
 victories are what is the name of the 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.210
 challenge that reward is because here 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.670
 that reward is I will go here 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.980
 play and concrete to play against whom 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.949
 I'm going to play and how much am I going to play 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.239
 Well, what do you want, how can you do it? 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.460
 so that it comes out in English because in 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.800
 Spanish is impossible because as you can see in 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.879
 Spanish some things are on and 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.190
 They are evil and you notice they are wrong so 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.679
 what are we going to do in this video 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.809
 I will explain how you can put it in 

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:50.399
 English and also in the annotations of 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.940
 this video and in the description I'll go 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:57.089
 adding in several days they will be adding 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.739
 all the challenges separately I 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:00.779
 translating the in Spanish because there will be 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.729
 many people who can not understand them or 

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:05.330
 that just in case someday he tells you in the 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:07.580
 challenge east of lr 2 k 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.190
 what requirements do you have? 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.470
 video of that requirement and that 's it and it's already 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.660
 you pass it if he sees it and it's already I think 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.860
 which is a good way to know 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.270
 because many times you ask me what 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.800
 requirement has this challenge what 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.080
 requirements has this other and many 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.060
 Sometimes I forget what a requirement this is 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.610
 or what requirement was it to get the 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.950
 wilkins then with those videos already 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.960
 are there as a reminder and I pass the 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.420
 video and you see what requirement is in that 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.760
 at that time so if you want 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.320
 put it in English before there was a way 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.440
 that was to go to options in the game 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.930
 options change the language and put it in 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.670
 English and it already worked but now although 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.590
 put it in another language do not put in 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.070
 English keeps showing up this way in 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.650
 black 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.260
 then if you have playstation 4 on xbox 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.060
 I do not know if changing the language is still 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.490
 working if it continues to work then 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.800
 follow it like that but change the language as 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.780
 we do here from the console and it's how 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.920
 it will work that we have to do for 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:07.270
 playstation button irnos 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:10.810
 to the adjustments and we go down to where we 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:14.380
 appear language here in language we change 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.300
 the system language to english from usa 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.350
 we say yes, it has to be closed 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.900
 the application 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.030
 and once the application is closed 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.450
 you will see that he is going to change the nba 2k 15 by 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:29.720
 complete because once you are going to enter 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:32.180
 is going to show you the information there 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.920
 the news that that never happens when 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.020
 we have the game in Spanish we never 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.910
 warns of what is new that has been 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.550
 added icons appear images 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.730
 but you do not see what is being the 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.470
 news we see there some shoes 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.900
 from time to time we see that they have added 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.810
 some challenge we see that there is a new 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.210
 video of 2 khatibi but you never see 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.090
 you never see what's new 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.920
 etcetera and if we put it in English with 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.020
 the console now we have to do it with 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.030
 the console yes or yes that is something that does not 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.920
 I understand that before we change the language 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.620
 of the game and there are things that continue 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.710
 staying in the main but good 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.740
 are those 2k failures that the truth as 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.200
 you see 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:17.010
 here we enter and they already inform us of things 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.510
 the new ruby ruby sounds that already 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:23.319
 they are not available but they were the 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:25.680
 sounds like the challenge there we have it 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:28.700
 right now is this in 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:33.109
 in Spanish so let's put it 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.109
 language options 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.099
 As you can see, it has made us crazy. 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.410
 game in English but it has been put in 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:41.239
 Spanish shall make adjustments to the system will 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.090
 we give that and as you see has put in 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:47.250
 English let's get caught but 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:50.790
 pilla-pilla we go here to my team 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:55.010
 and we're going to see that the challenges now do 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:57.300
 that appear with the rewards that are 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.720
 come on here it's aliens 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:03.390
 and as you can see they appear with the name 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:07.460
 rewards and restrictions 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:11.220
 all have their restrictions and this 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:15.030
 it's a wonder because we can finally 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.380
 see what each one is and play without 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.600
 no problem because there are some that 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:22.110
 I already tell you that in Spanish they are wrong 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:25.520
 translated that puts some things and 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:28.350
 they really are others so I'm telling you 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.990
 I will upload the videos of each 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.520
 challenge if someone asks us or 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.500
 you ask me for a 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.910
 challenge I pass the video saying then 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.560
 This 2k reward 12,000 meters and only 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.300
 you can have you have to have 8 of those 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.370
 celtics without any player of the lakers 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.250
 the rest the ones that you want then there 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:50.160
 we would have a video the same for this 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.380
 what reward and what and such because 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.330
 each as every week they add one 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.720
 again I can not do this same video 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.670
 every week then with this way 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.680
 we have them all so you know 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.949
 save this video in favorites because 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.810
 I will add those in annotations and in the 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:09.000
 first I will add them in hidden for 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:09.509
 that suddenly not a lot of 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.490
 videos 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:14.039
 the same day and it keeps releasing 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:16.889
 surely the weekend on Saturday 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:19.050
 On Sunday, I'll release each video in 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:22.830
 public but being not hidden and being 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:24.870
 in the annotations in the description what 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:29.160
 you can see in any way 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:31.350
 so give favorites to this video and 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.660
 put it there to save or save 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.759
 markers and so you will have it by hand 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.530
 whenever you want to see some challenge and 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:39.510
 if any challenge is not in that moment 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.520
 when it comes out can you ask me 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.289
 twitter I'll let you know if the video is 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.060
 going up or when I'm going to upload it and 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:46.710
 others and I will tell you the restrictions by 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.449
 as always when you ask me so 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.370
