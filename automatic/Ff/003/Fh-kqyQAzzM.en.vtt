the whole way I've been playing lately I
usually<00:00:20.670> speed<00:00:21.029> up<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.240> gameplay<00:00:21.600> to<00:00:21.660> help

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
the same speed just in case somebody

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.019 
the same speed just in case somebody
actually<00:00:25.369> uses<00:00:26.369> us<00:00:26.550> or<00:00:26.789> whatever<00:00:27.740> so<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:29.609> want

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
to get to this point because i

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.569 
to get to this point because i
accidentally<00:00:33.960> stumbled<00:00:34.710> on<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.130> way<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.370> get

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
accidentally stumbled on a way to get

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.869 
accidentally stumbled on a way to get
into<00:00:35.820> his<00:00:35.940> room<00:00:36.180> by<00:00:37.020> blinking<00:00:37.620> into<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:38.430> very

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
into his room by blinking into a very

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.310 
into his room by blinking into a very
small<00:00:39.000> crawl<00:00:39.600> space

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.250 

not<00:00:44.950> sure<00:00:45.070> if<00:00:45.130> I<00:00:45.220> ever<00:00:45.450> stop<00:00:46.450> failing<00:00:46.780> at<00:00:47.200> this

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
not sure if I ever stop failing at this

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.760 
not sure if I ever stop failing at this
I<00:00:47.850> might<00:00:48.850> show<00:00:49.059> you

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.740 

right<00:00:52.770> there<00:00:53.040> um<00:00:53.310> you<00:00:54.060> can<00:00:54.240> blink<00:00:54.390> in<00:00:54.570> there

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
right there um you can blink in there

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.180 
right there um you can blink in there
and<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.080> probably<00:00:55.320> wouldn't<00:00:55.740> have<00:00:56.010> worked

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
and that probably wouldn't have worked

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.470 
and that probably wouldn't have worked
any<00:00:56.490> other<00:00:56.730> time<00:00:57.230> but<00:00:58.230> now<00:00:58.970> so<00:00:59.970> you<00:01:00.030> made<00:01:00.330> it

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
any other time but now so you made it

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.640 
any other time but now so you made it
into<00:01:00.870> sockos<00:01:01.820> house<00:01:03.290> remember<00:01:04.290> with<00:01:04.440> some

just let out a mutated version of the

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.670 
just let out a mutated version of the
play<00:03:30.310> but<00:03:30.610> whatever<00:03:31.320> hopefully<00:03:32.320> she'll<00:03:32.530> just

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
play but whatever hopefully she'll just

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.450 
play but whatever hopefully she'll just
go<00:03:33.100> in<00:03:33.250> her<00:03:33.370> little<00:03:33.550> corner<00:03:34.000> and<00:03:34.210> die<00:03:34.840> there<00:03:35.460> so

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:36.460 
go in her little corner and die there so

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.370 
go in her little corner and die there so
I'll<00:03:36.580> just<00:03:36.610> hide<00:03:36.910> in<00:03:37.030> a<00:03:37.090> corner<00:03:37.270> and<00:03:37.570> leave<00:03:37.780> but

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
I'll just hide in a corner and leave but

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.230 
I'll just hide in a corner and leave but
I<00:03:38.620> mean<00:03:38.890> nobody<00:03:39.010> saw<00:03:39.280> me<00:03:39.310> right<00:03:39.640> so<00:03:39.880> nobody

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
I mean nobody saw me right so nobody

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:47.550 
I mean nobody saw me right so nobody
knows<00:03:40.420> it's<00:03:40.750> me<00:03:45.150> and<00:03:46.150> finally<00:03:46.690> you<00:03:47.020> would<00:03:47.320> just

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
knows it's me and finally you would just

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.740 
knows it's me and finally you would just
have<00:03:47.710> to<00:03:48.100> get<00:03:48.190> him<00:03:48.340> back<00:03:48.370> to<00:03:49.000> søren<00:03:49.360> during<00:03:49.630> the

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
have to get him back to søren during the

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.770 
have to get him back to søren during the
boat<00:03:49.930> I<00:03:50.380> guess<00:03:50.800> he<00:03:50.950> doesn't<00:03:51.130> wake<00:03:51.640> up<00:03:51.820> and<00:03:52.660> my

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
boat I guess he doesn't wake up and my

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.060 
boat I guess he doesn't wake up and my
mind<00:03:53.020> probably<00:03:53.410> don't<00:03:53.560> have<00:03:53.650> to<00:03:53.830> worry<00:03:53.980> about

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
mind probably don't have to worry about

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.450 
mind probably don't have to worry about
that<00:03:54.360> I'm<00:03:55.360> back<00:03:55.870> actually<00:03:56.500> it<00:03:56.680> syndrome<00:03:57.100> as

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:57.460 
that I'm back actually it syndrome as

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:02.100 
that I'm back actually it syndrome as
hard<00:03:57.850> as<00:03:57.940> it<00:03:58.000> sounds<00:03:58.360> either<00:04:00.360> because<00:04:01.360> you<00:04:01.870> can

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
hard as it sounds either because you can

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:05.820 
hard as it sounds either because you can
just<00:04:03.060> pretty<00:04:04.060> much<00:04:04.240> bring<00:04:04.690> across<00:04:05.110> a<00:04:05.230> few<00:04:05.680> of

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
just pretty much bring across a few of

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.160 
just pretty much bring across a few of
those<00:04:05.950> chocolates<00:04:06.450> even<00:04:07.450> while<00:04:07.810> generating

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
those chocolates even while generating

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.690 
those chocolates even while generating
him

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.650 

I<00:04:14.620> wonder<00:04:15.620> if<00:04:15.770> I<00:04:16.040> could<00:04:16.220> have<00:04:16.489> gotten<00:04:16.730> just<00:04:17.389> up

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
I wonder if I could have gotten just up

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.510 
I wonder if I could have gotten just up
here<00:04:17.950> probably<00:04:18.950> not<00:04:20.919> I'd<00:04:21.919> be<00:04:22.070> something<00:04:22.430> to

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
here probably not I'd be something to

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.400 
here probably not I'd be something to
look<00:04:22.550> into<00:04:22.790> that<00:04:24.490> Samuel<00:04:25.490> is<00:04:25.810> located<00:04:26.810> under

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
look into that Samuel is located under

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.830 
look into that Samuel is located under
the<00:04:27.440> bridge<00:04:27.889> where<00:04:28.580> the<00:04:28.610> prisoners<00:04:29.210> were<00:04:29.270> at

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
the bridge where the prisoners were at

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.930 
the bridge where the prisoners were at
that<00:04:30.139> you<00:04:30.350> freed<00:04:30.830> if<00:04:31.040> you've<00:04:31.220> got<00:04:31.690> the<00:04:33.940> Miss

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
that you freed if you've got the Miss
