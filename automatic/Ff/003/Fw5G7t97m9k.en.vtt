00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:09.240
 and then that neighbor beauty ac quick 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:11.370
 teaches you how to let at least 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:16.049
 mine never worked like letting the 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.030
 territory again because we are 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.340
 in the population in the cast 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.230
 cell phone comes to tone comes configured 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.020
 automatic is thus a 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.600
 automatic network configuration 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.440
 if signal 3g has very much 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.009
 weak 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:36.989
 the network will switch to the crazy 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:40.199
 so it's always leave on the 3g 4g and 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.800
 brothers and sisters to 2g training and 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:50.749
 3g 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:50.749
 beauty is that you can not type the number 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:01:08.070
 indicates square square 3282 square 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:21.990
 will open this configuration here faithful 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:23.070
 test here the network types in the second 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:30.109
 option 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:34.079
 on my team already in 2014 genelhu 

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:35.420
 of Brazilian automation processes 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.039
 intentions and engineers were 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:41.909
 updated 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:44.090
 I'll speak it all automatically 2g 3g 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:52.829
 4g 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:54.179
 because my 3g and 4g chip which one 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:02:02.130
 mentions that only four days 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:02:02.700
 selected the 4g is that there is this to there 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.429
 do 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.399
 thanks, thank you if you liked the video 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:11.330
 do not like it, it subscribes to the channel 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.330
