00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:11.980 
the onion cube yeah there you go Matt

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.740 
the onion cube yeah there you go Matt
but<00:00:13.629> basically<00:00:14.629> what<00:00:14.990> it<00:00:15.860> is<00:00:16.160> most<00:00:17.119> likely<00:00:17.390> as

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
but basically what it is most likely as

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.540 
but basically what it is most likely as
they<00:00:17.930> start<00:00:18.530> relay<00:00:18.860> on<00:00:19.039> the<00:00:19.160> side<00:00:19.369> of<00:00:19.400> the

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
they start relay on the side of the

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.630 
they start relay on the side of the
compressor<00:00:20.290> combat<00:00:21.290> like<00:00:21.980> a<00:00:22.010> thing<00:00:22.610> that

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
compressor combat like a thing that

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.460 
compressor combat like a thing that
actually<00:00:23.290> kicks<00:00:24.290> it<00:00:24.470> on<00:00:25.990> we<00:00:26.990> just<00:00:27.020> had<00:00:27.320> that

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
compressor and also has a it's kind of

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.220 
compressor and also has a it's kind of
like<00:03:05.880> a<00:03:05.940> starter<00:03:06.239> motor<00:03:06.390> in<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.630> curve<00:03:06.810> right

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
like a starter motor in the curve right

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.199 
like a starter motor in the curve right
you<00:03:07.709> it<00:03:08.550> also<00:03:08.730> has<00:03:09.090> a<00:03:09.320> thing<00:03:10.320> on<00:03:10.470> it<00:03:10.640> that<00:03:11.640> will

you it also has a thing on it that will
kick<00:03:12.570> the<00:03:12.780> compressor<00:03:13.350> all<00:03:13.530> right<00:03:14.280> there<00:03:14.459> if

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
kick the compressor all right there if

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.820 
kick the compressor all right there if
it<00:03:14.670> gets<00:03:14.880> too<00:03:15.060> hot<00:03:15.300> okay<00:03:15.870> if<00:03:16.320> the<00:03:16.440> compressor

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
it gets too hot okay if the compressor

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.940 
it gets too hot okay if the compressor
off<00:03:17.360> if<00:03:18.360> it<00:03:18.570> notices<00:03:18.690> that<00:03:19.110> the<00:03:19.260> compressor<00:03:19.770> is

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
off if it notices that the compressor is

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.660 
off if it notices that the compressor is
overheating<00:03:20.489> like<00:03:22.130> a<00:03:23.130> little<00:03:23.430> computer

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
overheating like a little computer

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.900 
overheating like a little computer
inspection<00:03:24.770> you<00:03:25.770> can<00:03:25.800> actually<00:03:26.310> see<00:03:26.790> the

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
inspection you can actually see the

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.210 
inspection you can actually see the
stuff<00:03:27.150> breaking<00:03:27.600> out<00:03:27.750> there<00:03:28.110> that's<00:03:28.470> not<00:03:28.680> good

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:46.469 
well I think that the company itself got

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:49.520 
well I think that the company itself got
a<00:03:46.530> problem<00:03:47.040> with<00:03:47.400> their<00:03:48.200> one<00:03:49.200> that<00:03:49.379> they

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
a problem with their one that they

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.589 
a problem with their one that they
design<00:03:52.519> so<00:03:53.519> this<00:03:53.700> is<00:03:53.879> the<00:03:54.000> old<00:03:54.120> one

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
design so this is the old one

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.380 
design so this is the old one
yep<00:03:54.920> and<00:03:55.920> that's<00:03:56.069> the<00:03:56.280> new<00:03:56.400> one<00:03:56.819> there's

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
yep and that's the new one there's
