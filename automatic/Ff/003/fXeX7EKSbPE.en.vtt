00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
do like a lot of packaging these days

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.310 
do like a lot of packaging these days
comes<00:00:54.059> with<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.360> like<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.690> little<00:00:54.899> tear<00:00:55.170> off

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
comes with the like the little tear off

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:03.170 
comes with the like the little tear off
backs<00:00:58.320> on<00:00:58.680> things<00:00:58.980> now<00:01:00.350> still<00:01:01.350> love<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:02.180> just

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
backs on things now still love that just

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.780 
backs on things now still love that just
makes<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.510> lot<00:01:03.690> easier<00:01:03.719> than<00:01:04.229> having<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.790> cut

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
makes a lot easier than having to cut

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:17.179 
makes a lot easier than having to cut
open<00:01:05.970> things<00:01:12.110> bug<00:01:15.590> got<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.619> little<00:01:16.799> piece<00:01:16.979> of

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
open things bug got a little piece of

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.060 
open things bug got a little piece of
tape<00:01:17.430> here<00:01:18.200> holding<00:01:19.200> down<00:01:21.680> what<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:22.710> can<00:01:22.950> only

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
tape here holding down what I can only

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.420 
tape here holding down what I can only
assume<00:01:23.250> is<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.970> key<00:01:24.330> ring<00:01:27.710> if<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.860> focuses

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
assume is the key ring if it focuses

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.690 
assume is the key ring if it focuses
there<00:01:29.640> we<00:01:29.850> go<00:01:30.619> so<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.979> nice<00:01:32.130> thing<00:01:32.159> with<00:01:32.400> this

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
there we go so the nice thing with this

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:43.179 
there we go so the nice thing with this
is<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:34.040> it<00:01:35.040> protects<00:01:36.799> the<00:01:37.799> card<00:01:38.070> slots<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:39.119> I

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:46.490 

have<00:01:44.189> no<00:01:44.460> idea<00:01:44.729> how<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.880> go<00:01:45.030> there<00:01:45.090> we<00:01:45.299> go<00:01:45.500> aha

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
have no idea how to go there we go aha

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.350 
have no idea how to go there we go aha
so<00:01:46.890> that's<00:01:47.040> what<00:01:47.189> that's<00:01:47.369> also<00:01:47.729> useful<00:01:47.909> for<00:01:48.090> is

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
so that's what that's also useful for is

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.450 
so that's what that's also useful for is
to<00:01:48.479> pull<00:01:48.659> out<00:01:48.840> this<00:01:49.680> half<00:01:49.950> but<00:01:50.250> there<00:01:50.369> are

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
to pull out this half but there are

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.630 
to pull out this half but there are
little<00:01:50.670> ridges<00:01:51.090> on<00:01:51.299> both<00:01:51.479> sides<00:01:52.040> wow<00:01:53.040> really

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
little ridges on both sides wow really

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.660 
little ridges on both sides wow really
out<00:01:53.820> of<00:01:53.850> focus<00:01:54.680> there<00:01:55.680> we<00:01:55.770> go<00:01:55.890> this<00:01:56.250> guy<00:01:56.430> gets

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
out of focus there we go this guy gets

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.889 
out of focus there we go this guy gets
got<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:56.909> stay<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.060> little<00:01:57.210> further<00:01:57.450> away<00:01:57.630> there

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
got to stay a little further away there

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.539 
got to stay a little further away there
so<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:59.549> size<00:01:59.759> go<00:02:00.030> in<00:02:00.320> notice<00:02:01.340> you<00:02:02.340> know<00:02:02.399> it's

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
so the size go in notice you know it's

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.580 
so the size go in notice you know it's
just<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.880> really<00:02:03.149> protect<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:06.600> slots<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.350> the

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
just to really protect the slots and the

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.280 
just to really protect the slots and the
the<00:02:08.099> USB<00:02:08.520> 3.0<00:02:10.039> nothing<00:02:11.039> major<00:02:11.280> but

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
the USB 3.0 nothing major but

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.839 
the USB 3.0 nothing major but
you<00:02:13.040> know<00:02:13.159> if<00:02:13.310> you're<00:02:13.430> traveling<00:02:13.969> a<00:02:14.060> lot<00:02:14.209> and

you know if you're traveling a lot and

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.190 
you know if you're traveling a lot and
you<00:02:16.849> know<00:02:16.909> you're<00:02:17.060> tossing<00:02:17.329> this<00:02:17.659> in<00:02:17.900> and<00:02:18.079> out

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
you know you're tossing this in and out

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.369 
you know you're tossing this in and out
of<00:02:18.230> a<00:02:18.680> camera<00:02:19.040> bag<00:02:19.599> stuff<00:02:20.599> like<00:02:20.780> that<00:02:20.810> you<00:02:21.319> know

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
of a camera bag stuff like that you know

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:24.539 
of a camera bag stuff like that you know
just<00:02:21.650> a<00:02:21.680> little<00:02:21.799> extra<00:02:22.099> protection<00:02:22.219> does<00:02:22.760> help

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
just a little extra protection does help

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.119 
just a little extra protection does help
USB<00:02:25.549> 3.0<00:02:25.969> speeds<00:02:26.390> this<00:02:27.290> is<00:02:27.439> about<00:02:27.650> on<00:02:27.890> average

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
USB 3.0 speeds this is about on average

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:30.580 
USB 3.0 speeds this is about on average
with<00:02:28.730> pretty<00:02:29.629> much<00:02:29.720> any<00:02:29.930> other<00:02:30.019> card<00:02:30.379> reader

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
with pretty much any other card reader

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.220 
with pretty much any other card reader
out<00:02:30.769> there<00:02:30.980> right<00:02:31.159> now<00:02:31.189> and<00:02:32.019> the<00:02:33.019> price<00:02:33.200> is

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
out there right now and the price is

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.170 
out there right now and the price is
very<00:02:33.650> comparable<00:02:33.980> to<00:02:34.310> any<00:02:34.519> other<00:02:34.760> card<00:02:35.000> reader

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
very comparable to any other card reader

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.520 
very comparable to any other card reader
out<00:02:35.329> there<00:02:35.510> right<00:02:35.659> now<00:02:35.689> so<00:02:36.650> again<00:02:38.260> it<00:02:39.260> does

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
out there right now so again it does

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:49.020 
out there right now so again it does
have<00:02:40.719> dual<00:02:41.719> slots<00:02:42.049> which<00:02:42.260> some<00:02:42.650> don't<00:02:42.920> but

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.479 

that's<00:02:50.030> about<00:02:50.329> it<00:02:50.859> this<00:02:51.859> is<00:02:51.980> 10<00:02:52.129> for<00:02:52.370> Timmy
