00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
actually fairly effective because it

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.719 
actually fairly effective because it
does<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.439> lot<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.740> damage<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.280> stuns<00:01:35.549> and

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
you hit him but what you got to do is
