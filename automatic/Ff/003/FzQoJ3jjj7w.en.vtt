00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
put on two stocking caps and I just

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.289 
put on two stocking caps and I just
glued<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.070> caps<00:01:20.340> what<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.090> did

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.640 
glued it to the caps what I did
definitely<00:01:21.540> this<00:01:21.840> time<00:01:21.900> instead<00:01:22.290> of<00:01:22.439> gluing

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
definitely this time instead of gluing

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.530 
definitely this time instead of gluing
it<00:01:22.830> instead<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.369> stopping<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:24.000> tracks<00:01:24.270> right

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
it instead of stopping the tracks right

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.510 
it instead of stopping the tracks right
at<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.810> cap<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.259> took<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.950> little<00:01:25.979> bit<00:01:26.280> past

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
at the cap I took it a little bit past

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.880 
at the cap I took it a little bit past
the<00:01:27.240> cap<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:27.900> way<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.170> would<00:01:28.290> stay<00:01:28.530> on<00:01:28.560> my

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
the cap so that way it would stay on my

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.030 
the cap so that way it would stay on my
head<00:01:29.130> um

I<00:01:39.960> got<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.229> idea<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.619> do<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.460> really

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
I got the idea to do that and it really

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.039 
I got the idea to do that and it really
helps<00:01:41.909> everything<00:01:42.119> stay<00:01:42.420> nice<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:42.600> flat<00:01:42.869> and

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
helps everything stay nice and flat and

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.740 
helps everything stay nice and flat and
helps<00:01:43.290> your<00:01:43.380> stocking<00:01:44.250> caps<00:01:44.460> not<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.299> move

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
helps your stocking caps not to move

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.550 
helps your stocking caps not to move

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
another thing I don't like about this

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.860 
another thing I don't like about this
hair<00:02:47.840> is<00:02:48.170> um<00:02:48.590> and<00:02:49.070> the<00:02:49.880> iconic<00:02:50.210> wave<00:02:50.480> was<00:02:50.720> the

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
hair is um and the iconic wave was the

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.320 
hair is um and the iconic wave was the
same<00:02:51.080> way<00:02:51.350> the<00:02:51.950> tracks<00:02:52.250> are<00:02:52.460> extremely<00:02:53.000> thin

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
same way the tracks are extremely thin

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.350 
same way the tracks are extremely thin
if<00:02:53.960> you<00:02:54.140> guys<00:02:54.260> can<00:02:54.560> see<00:02:54.740> that<00:02:54.770> which<00:02:55.490> makes<00:02:55.790> the

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
if you guys can see that which makes the

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.570 
if you guys can see that which makes the
tracks<00:02:56.660> hard<00:02:56.930> to<00:02:57.080> cover<00:02:57.350> especially<00:02:58.100> when<00:02:58.490> you

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
tracks hard to cover especially when you

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.070 
tracks hard to cover especially when you
get<00:02:58.730> up<00:02:58.820> to<00:02:58.850> the<00:02:59.030> crown<00:02:59.210> of<00:02:59.360> your<00:02:59.480> head<00:02:59.510> here

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
get up to the crown of your head here

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.040 
get up to the crown of your head here
it's<00:03:00.650> so<00:03:01.040> hard<00:03:01.430> to<00:03:01.610> cover<00:03:01.850> um<00:03:02.210> they're

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
it's so hard to cover um they're

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.470 
it's so hard to cover um they're
extremely<00:03:03.590> extremely<00:03:03.980> thin<00:03:04.280> so<00:03:04.550> I<00:03:04.730> got<00:03:05.210> three

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
extremely extremely thin so I got three

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.000 
extremely extremely thin so I got three
packs<00:03:05.720> like<00:03:05.930> I<00:03:06.050> said<00:03:06.230> I<00:03:06.290> have<00:03:06.440> two<00:03:06.620> packs<00:03:06.860> of

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
packs like I said I have two packs of

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.970 
packs like I said I have two packs of
the<00:03:07.100> 1b<00:03:07.460> and<00:03:07.700> one<00:03:08.000> pack<00:03:08.270> of<00:03:08.300> the<00:03:08.750> p.m.<00:03:09.080> 4:30<00:03:09.410> and

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
the 1b and one pack of the p.m. 4:30 and

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.140 
the 1b and one pack of the p.m. 4:30 and
I<00:03:10.820> still<00:03:11.390> didn't<00:03:12.050> have<00:03:12.170> enough<00:03:12.410> hair<00:03:12.620> I<00:03:13.150> don't

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
I still didn't have enough hair I don't

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.720 
I still didn't have enough hair I don't
know<00:03:14.360> if<00:03:14.570> the<00:03:14.780> then<00:03:15.140> at<00:03:15.680> the<00:03:15.860> thin<00:03:16.070> tracks<00:03:16.430> have

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
know if the then at the thin tracks have

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.090 
know if the then at the thin tracks have
anything<00:03:17.030> to<00:03:17.180> do<00:03:17.300> with<00:03:17.330> that<00:03:17.480> but<00:03:17.900> I<00:03:18.080> if<00:03:18.740> I<00:03:18.950> were

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
anything to do with that but I if I were

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.430 
anything to do with that but I if I were
to<00:03:19.220> ever<00:03:19.280> use<00:03:19.670> his<00:03:19.850> hair<00:03:20.060> again<00:03:20.240> I<00:03:20.780> would

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
to ever use his hair again I would

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.350 
to ever use his hair again I would
probably<00:03:21.590> buy<00:03:22.070> four<00:03:22.370> packs<00:03:22.610> so<00:03:22.970> that<00:03:23.180> way

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
probably buy four packs so that way

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.240 
probably buy four packs so that way
because<00:03:23.600> the<00:03:23.930> tracks<00:03:24.170> are<00:03:24.380> thin<00:03:24.590> that<00:03:25.070> way

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.190 
way I'm doing it but um I had to take
out<00:05:11.700> a<00:05:11.730> track<00:05:12.000> from<00:05:12.120> the<00:05:12.270> back<00:05:12.480> and<00:05:12.780> use<00:05:12.990> it<00:05:13.140> in

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
out a track from the back and use it in

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.090 
out a track from the back and use it in
the<00:05:13.290> front<00:05:13.470> because<00:05:13.590> I<00:05:13.740> didn't<00:05:13.950> have<00:05:14.070> enough

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
the front because I didn't have enough

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.860 
the front because I didn't have enough
hair<00:05:14.430> because<00:05:15.210> I<00:05:15.300> was<00:05:15.419> trying<00:05:15.570> to<00:05:15.600> make<00:05:15.750> sure

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.720 
hair because I was trying to make sure
my<00:05:16.020> tracks<00:05:16.260> were<00:05:16.500> close<00:05:16.710> together<00:05:16.890> because

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:17.730 
my tracks were close together because

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.040 
my tracks were close together because
they<00:05:17.880> are<00:05:18.060> so<00:05:18.270> thin<00:05:18.480> so<00:05:18.630> I<00:05:18.660> wouldn't<00:05:18.840> have<00:05:18.960> to

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
they are so thin so I wouldn't have to

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.500 
they are so thin so I wouldn't have to
worry<00:05:19.200> about<00:05:19.320> that<00:05:19.530> but<00:05:20.120> not<00:05:21.120> really<00:05:21.210> fill<00:05:21.419> in
