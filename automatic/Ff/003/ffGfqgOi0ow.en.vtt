there<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:04.440> think<00:01:04.589> it's<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.769> question<00:01:04.890> the

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
there I think it's a question the

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.190 
there I think it's a question the
question<00:01:05.610> on<00:01:05.940> the<00:01:05.970> table<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.510> whether<00:01:06.780> send<00:01:07.110> we

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
question on the table is whether send we

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.950 
question on the table is whether send we
can<00:01:07.350> send<00:01:07.650> no<00:01:08.070> matter<00:01:08.659> opportunity<00:01:09.659> or<00:01:09.750> freak

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
can send no matter opportunity or freak

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.660 
can send no matter opportunity or freak
parents<00:01:10.140> or<00:01:10.439> not<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.159> has<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.460> board

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
parents or not so it has the board

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.960
