report there too not necessarily the

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.089 
report there too not necessarily the
gameplay<00:03:04.540> itself<00:03:04.870> though<00:03:05.139> Riptide<00:03:05.620> goes<00:03:05.859> for

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
gameplay itself though Riptide goes for

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.369 
gameplay itself though Riptide goes for
the<00:03:06.220> use<00:03:06.819> anything<00:03:07.209> you<00:03:07.389> can<00:03:07.510> approach<00:03:08.109> when

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:08.379 
the use anything you can approach when

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:10.319 
the use anything you can approach when
it<00:03:08.500> comes<00:03:08.680> to<00:03:08.829> combat<00:03:09.250> you<00:03:09.609> can<00:03:09.730> pick<00:03:09.879> up<00:03:09.909> tons

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
it comes to combat you can pick up tons

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:12.539 
it comes to combat you can pick up tons
of<00:03:10.540> different<00:03:10.810> weapons<00:03:10.989> not<00:03:11.650> only<00:03:11.859> that<00:03:12.069> you

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
of different weapons not only that you

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.580 
of different weapons not only that you
can<00:03:12.579> also<00:03:12.730> upgrade<00:03:13.120> them<00:03:13.569> and<00:03:13.810> even<00:03:13.930> modify

can also upgrade them and even modify

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.069

them<00:03:14.799> so<00:03:15.069> you<00:03:15.760> know<00:03:15.879> the<00:03:16.000> old<00:03:16.180> baseball<00:03:16.510> bats

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
them so you know the old baseball bats

can become a spiked death ball so the

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.550 
can become a spiked death ball so the
core<00:03:24.310> gameplay<00:03:24.639> is<00:03:24.879> really<00:03:25.000> about<00:03:25.560> scavenging
