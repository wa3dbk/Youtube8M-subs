 match tonight against Algeria 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.960
 Malian players are aware that the Greens hope an opponent of 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.600
 size despite their defeat against malawi where I was shot down the cold 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.220
 the Malian selection that drew in front of Angola during the match 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.160
 opening 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.160

 for the Malian selection 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.710
 probably the same selection that played 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.129
