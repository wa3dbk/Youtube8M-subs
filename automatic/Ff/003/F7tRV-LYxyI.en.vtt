hi<00:00:12.030> everyone<00:00:12.420> I<00:00:12.889> bought<00:00:13.889> some<00:00:13.949> conductive

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
hi everyone I bought some conductive

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.029 
hi everyone I bought some conductive
paint<00:00:14.730> recently<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:16.049> I<00:00:16.470> want<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:16.680> play<00:00:16.860> around

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
paint recently and I want to play around

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.250 
paint recently and I want to play around
with<00:00:17.220> it<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.369> see<00:00:17.460> what<00:00:17.640> i<00:00:17.699> could<00:00:17.820> do<00:00:18.260> the

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
with it and see what i could do the

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.490 
with it and see what i could do the
stuff<00:00:19.470> that<00:00:19.500> I<00:00:19.650> used<00:00:20.010> is<00:00:20.940> called<00:00:21.599> behr<00:00:22.199> paint

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
stuff that I used is called behr paint

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.589 
stuff that I used is called behr paint
and<00:00:22.890> it's<00:00:23.250> made<00:00:23.400> by<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.550> company<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:24.300> believe

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:24.599 
and it's made by a company I believe

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:26.509 
and it's made by a company I believe
that<00:00:24.630> spaced<00:00:24.960> out<00:00:25.080> in<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.320> UK<00:00:25.800> called<00:00:26.130> bare

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
that spaced out in the UK called bare

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.929 
that spaced out in the UK called bare
conductive<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:27.419> got<00:00:28.380> my<00:00:28.650> jaw<00:00:29.039> from<00:00:29.400> sparkfun

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
conductive I got my jaw from sparkfun

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.110 
conductive I got my jaw from sparkfun
and<00:00:30.570> 25<00:00:31.439> bucks<00:00:31.710> will<00:00:32.310> give<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.759> 50

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
and 25 bucks will give you a 50

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.950 
and 25 bucks will give you a 50
milliliter<00:00:33.540> jar<00:00:34.190> you<00:00:35.190> can<00:00:35.340> also<00:00:35.460> buy<00:00:35.960> these

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
milliliter jar you can also buy these

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.750 
milliliter jar you can also buy these
little<00:00:37.230> pens<00:00:37.440> too<00:00:37.800> so<00:00:37.980> if<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.160> want<00:00:38.310> to<00:00:38.340> work<00:00:38.640> a

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
little pens too so if you want to work a

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.880 
little pens too so if you want to work a
little<00:00:38.880> bit<00:00:39.030> more<00:00:39.180> precisely<00:00:39.680> this<00:00:40.680> might<00:00:40.860> be

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
little bit more precisely this might be

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.810 
little bit more precisely this might be
the<00:00:41.130> better<00:00:41.280> tool<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.760> be<00:00:41.850> working<00:00:42.180> with<00:00:43.820> now

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
the better tool to be working with now

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.250 
the better tool to be working with now
the<00:00:45.120> first<00:00:45.300> thing<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.630> I<00:00:45.690> noticed<00:00:45.720> about

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
the first thing that I noticed about

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.810 
the first thing that I noticed about
this<00:00:46.440> stuff<00:00:46.680> was<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:48.590> it's<00:00:49.590> really<00:00:50.010> really

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
this stuff was that it's really really

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.910 
this stuff was that it's really really
thick<00:00:51.480> so<00:00:52.170> it's<00:00:52.320> definitely<00:00:52.590> not<00:00:52.710> your

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
thick so it's definitely not your

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.550 
thick so it's definitely not your
regular<00:00:53.100> house<00:00:53.550> paint<00:00:53.910> but<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.990> applies<00:00:55.260> well

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:55.560 
regular house paint but it applies well

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.360 
regular house paint but it applies well
to<00:00:55.920> paper<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.920> acrylic<00:00:58.920> which<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.190> what<00:00:59.340> I

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
to paper and acrylic which is what I

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:07.399 
to paper and acrylic which is what I
ended<00:00:59.430> up<00:00:59.760> doing<00:01:01.550> so<00:01:02.550> what<00:01:03.450> I<00:01:03.480> made<00:01:03.720> here<00:01:05.420> is<00:01:06.420> a

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
ended up doing so what I made here is a

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.539 
ended up doing so what I made here is a
little<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:08.580> touch<00:01:09.060> piano<00:01:09.710> when<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.799> for<00:01:11.070> key<00:01:11.280> set

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
little a touch piano when I for key set

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.730 
little a touch piano when I for key set
up<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.880> around<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.270> region<00:01:12.509> which<00:01:13.469> plays

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
up and around this region which plays

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.469 
up and around this region which plays
different<00:01:14.219> tones<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.759> lights<00:01:14.969> up<00:01:15.119> different

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
different tones and lights up different

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.899 
different tones and lights up different
LEDs<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:16.219> want<00:01:17.219> to<00:01:17.249> take<00:01:17.399> away<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.759> paper

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
LEDs I want to take away the paper

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.899 
LEDs I want to take away the paper
covering<00:01:18.509> we<00:01:18.960> can<00:01:19.140> see<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.649> the<00:01:20.340> capacitive

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
covering we can see the the capacitive

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.969 
covering we can see the the capacitive
pads<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.600> all<00:01:22.049> this<00:01:22.170> stuff<00:01:22.289> is<00:01:22.499> going<00:01:22.710> out<00:01:22.829> to

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
pads and all this stuff is going out to

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.950 
pads and all this stuff is going out to
an<00:01:23.069> arduino<00:01:23.490> pro<00:01:23.729> mini<00:01:23.759> which<00:01:24.329> is<00:01:24.479> using<00:01:24.810> the

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
an arduino pro mini which is using the

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.260 
an arduino pro mini which is using the
CapSense<00:01:25.380> library<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.310> that's<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:26.909> very<00:01:26.939> same

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
CapSense library and that's a very same

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.169 
CapSense library and that's a very same

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
project for halloween over here to see

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.919 
project for halloween over here to see
leds<00:01:33.929> and<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:34.259> goes<00:01:34.439> out<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.859> Arduino<00:01:35.460> as

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:35.929 
leds and that goes out to the Arduino as

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:40.639 
leds and that goes out to the Arduino as
well<00:01:37.310> now<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.299> biggest<00:01:39.869> problem<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.560> I

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
well now the the biggest problem that I

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:42.200 
well now the the biggest problem that I
face<00:01:41.009> when<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.340> was<00:01:41.460> working<00:01:41.579> with<00:01:41.819> this<00:01:41.969> stuff

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
face when I was working with this stuff

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.559 
face when I was working with this stuff
was<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:43.460> if<00:01:44.460> you're<00:01:44.729> going<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:44.969> paint<00:01:45.210> thin

00:01:45.559 --> 00:01:45.569 
was that if you're going to paint thin

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:48.349 
was that if you're going to paint thin
lines<00:01:45.840> you're<00:01:46.590> going<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.159> encounter<00:01:47.359> hi

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:48.359 
lines you're going to encounter hi

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:50.719 
lines you're going to encounter hi
resistances<00:01:49.259> so<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:49.829> want<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.189> paint<00:01:50.399> nice

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
resistances so you want to paint nice

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.029 
resistances so you want to paint nice
thick<00:01:51.179> pads<00:01:51.840> or<00:01:52.289> lines<00:01:53.329> to<00:01:54.329> get<00:01:54.859> to<00:01:55.859> get<00:01:56.009> a

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
thick pads or lines to get to get a

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:58.910 
thick pads or lines to get to get a
reasonable<00:01:56.700> resistance<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.740> started<00:01:58.740> out<00:01:58.829> with

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
reasonable resistance I started out with

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.629 
reasonable resistance I started out with
really<00:01:59.310> thin<00:02:00.920> not<00:02:01.920> we're<00:02:02.069> not<00:02:02.130> really<00:02:02.399> thin

00:02:02.629 --> 00:02:02.639 
really thin not we're not really thin

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:06.739 
really thin not we're not really thin
more<00:02:02.850> reasonably<00:02:03.329> thin<00:02:04.549> lines<00:02:05.549> but<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.299> LEDs

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:06.749 
more reasonably thin lines but the LEDs

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:09.109 
more reasonably thin lines but the LEDs
just<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.469> resistances<00:02:08.039> were<00:02:08.220> so<00:02:08.399> high<00:02:09.090> that

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
just the resistances were so high that

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.230 
just the resistances were so high that
the<00:02:09.569> LEDs<00:02:09.990> were<00:02:10.259> just<00:02:10.470> really<00:02:10.740> dim<00:02:11.130> so<00:02:11.459> I<00:02:11.700> ended

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
the LEDs were just really dim so I ended

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.990 
the LEDs were just really dim so I ended
up<00:02:12.360> painting<00:02:12.630> thicker<00:02:13.110> thicker<00:02:13.709> lines<00:02:14.069> I<00:02:14.400> also

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
up painting thicker thicker lines I also

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.809 
up painting thicker thicker lines I also
extended<00:02:15.480> out<00:02:15.599> the<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:16.080> copper<00:02:16.409> tape<00:02:16.790> so<00:02:17.790> that

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
extended out the the copper tape so that

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.190 
extended out the the copper tape so that
he<00:02:18.450> would<00:02:18.599> get

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
he would get

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.800 
he would get
much<00:02:19.319> voltage<00:02:19.590> drop<00:02:20.150> as<00:02:21.150> well<00:02:21.890> so<00:02:23.390> overall<00:02:24.390> it

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
much voltage drop as well so overall it

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.830 
much voltage drop as well so overall it
was<00:02:25.019> it<00:02:25.920> was<00:02:26.069> really<00:02:26.340> fun<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:26.819> work<00:02:27.420> with<00:02:27.480> us
