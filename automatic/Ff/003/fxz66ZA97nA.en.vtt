00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
I figured that'd be a little bit too

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.459 
I figured that'd be a little bit too
much<00:00:35.579> so<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:36.120> figured<00:00:36.809> I<00:00:36.840> just<00:00:37.020> uploaded<00:00:37.230> like

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
much so I figured I just uploaded like

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.500 
much so I figured I just uploaded like
this<00:00:37.739> talk<00:00:38.280> about<00:00:38.460> each<00:00:38.579> one<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:39.120> give<00:00:39.360> some

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
this talk about each one and give some

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.910 
this talk about each one and give some
tips<00:00:39.660> for<00:00:39.870> each<00:00:39.989> map<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:40.500> I<00:00:40.530> play<00:00:40.739> because

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
tips for each map that I play because

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
tips for each map that I play because
they're<00:00:41.010> all<00:00:41.100> in<00:00:41.190> different<00:00:41.309> maps<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.760> pretty

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
they're all in different maps and pretty

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.400 
they're all in different maps and pretty
sure<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.960> think<00:00:42.989> they're<00:00:43.230> all<00:00:43.320> with

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
sure to and I think they're all with

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.529 
sure to and I think they're all with
different<00:00:43.440> guns<00:00:43.829> too<00:00:44.129> so<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.640> lot<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.000> variety

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
different guns too so a lot of variety

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.270 
different guns too so a lot of variety
so<00:00:45.750> that's<00:00:45.899> pretty<00:00:46.110> good<00:00:46.289> but<00:00:46.800> anyways<00:00:47.100> I

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280

and you need amplify and that's all you
need<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.110> can<00:01:37.259> see<00:01:37.439> now<00:01:38.189> what<00:01:38.939> happens<00:01:39.270> is

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
there ends up being a spawn point back

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.230 
there ends up being a spawn point back
here<00:01:41.250> behind<00:01:41.369> me<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:41.880> see<00:01:42.090> me

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
just consistently check that spawn point

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.289 
just consistently check that spawn point
back<00:01:52.320> there<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:53.310> just<00:01:53.520> sound<00:01:53.759> for<00:01:53.970> anyone

it makes like a little cleaning noise on
the<00:02:00.960> metal<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.680> can<00:02:01.829> hear<00:02:02.040> when<00:02:02.189> they<00:02:02.280> come<00:02:02.430> on

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549

the stairs behind you then obviously you

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.810 
the stairs behind you then obviously you

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
can look up the window and then just

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.670 
can look up the window and then just
consistently<00:02:06.750> keep<00:02:06.960> checking<00:02:07.290> that<00:02:07.409> spawn

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
consistently keep checking that spawn

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.260 
consistently keep checking that spawn

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
this map every time I do this so it's

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.680 
this map every time I do this so it's
pretty<00:02:28.860> consistent<00:02:29.460> and<00:02:29.700> I<00:02:30.210> feel<00:02:30.450> like<00:02:30.480> it's

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
pretty consistent and I feel like it's

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
pretty consistent and I feel like it's
probably<00:02:30.780> one<00:02:31.020> of<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.140> best<00:02:31.290> free<00:02:31.530> for<00:02:31.650> all
