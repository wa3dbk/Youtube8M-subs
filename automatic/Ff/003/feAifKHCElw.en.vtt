00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
mile I think we got like 260 k if we

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.230 
mile I think we got like 260 k if we
include<00:00:22.830> coal<00:00:23.130> Cheney<00:00:23.400> who<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:23.820> on<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.029> menu

and who I have no his price arising a
slight<00:00:26.820> bit<00:00:27.119> so<00:00:27.390> definitely<00:00:28.109> I<00:00:28.199> would<00:00:28.320> suggest

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
slight bit so definitely I would suggest

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.830 
slight bit so definitely I would suggest
investing<00:00:29.519> him<00:00:29.640> if<00:00:29.849> you<00:00:30.000> have<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.330> coins<00:00:30.570> to

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
investing him if you have the coins to

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.630 
investing him if you have the coins to
spare<00:00:31.170> but<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.470> course<00:00:31.710> if<00:00:31.890> you're<00:00:32.099> like<00:00:32.309> 20k

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
spare but of course if you're like 20k

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.280

really<00:00:34.469> wouldnt<00:00:34.710> recommend<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.070> because<00:00:35.160> it

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
really wouldnt recommend that because it

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.299 
really wouldnt recommend that because it
could<00:00:35.550> possibly<00:00:35.910> go<00:00:36.210> wrong<00:00:36.559> but<00:00:37.559> we<00:00:37.710> saw<00:00:38.190> that

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
lot of coins like that it's very very

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.139 
lot of coins like that it's very very
strange<00:01:45.810> but<00:01:46.110> we<00:01:46.590> got<00:01:46.799> we<00:01:46.979> slashed<00:01:47.369> on<00:01:47.490> for<00:01:47.670> 79

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149

k<00:01:48.390> which<00:01:48.570> was<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.750> nice<00:01:48.930> profit<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.590> about<00:01:49.710> or<00:01:50.189> K

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
and a little bit maybe I think that's

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.100 
and a little bit maybe I think that's
what<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:53.210> assuming<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.270> bomb<00:01:54.450> st.<00:01:54.750> Sookie

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:27.589 
literally it wasn't as good as am i as
it<00:04:26.220> should<00:04:26.460> be<00:04:26.669> that<00:04:26.849> I<00:04:26.939> think<00:04:27.180> honestly<00:04:27.360> if

00:04:27.589 --> 00:04:27.599 
it should be that I think honestly if

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:30.499 
it should be that I think honestly if
you've<00:04:27.930> got<00:04:28.080> a<00:04:28.110> CF<00:04:29.099> card<00:04:29.610> convert<00:04:29.969> to<00:04:30.090> strike<00:04:30.479> a

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:30.509 
you've got a CF card convert to strike a

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:32.510 
you've got a CF card convert to strike a
CAD<00:04:30.810> I<00:04:31.020> should<00:04:31.439> go<00:04:31.560> for<00:04:31.710> like<00:04:31.800> 3<00:04:32.069> k<00:04:32.219> mole<00:04:32.400> but

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
CAD I should go for like 3 k mole but

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.100 
CAD I should go for like 3 k mole but
literally<00:04:32.789> this<00:04:32.909> wasn't<00:04:33.300> but<00:04:33.659> we<00:04:33.719> can<00:04:33.960> still

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
literally this wasn't but we can still

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.659 
literally this wasn't but we can still
make<00:04:34.229> about<00:04:34.409> one<00:04:34.620> and<00:04:34.740> a<00:04:34.830> half<00:04:34.860> can<00:04:35.219> make<00:04:35.490> that

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
make about one and a half can make that

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:38.059 
make about one and a half can make that
might<00:04:35.879> be<00:04:35.969> 2k<00:04:36.210> actually<00:04:36.689> I<00:04:36.719> think<00:04:36.919> that<00:04:37.919> maybe

00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:38.069 
might be 2k actually I think that maybe

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:40.070 
might be 2k actually I think that maybe
it'll<00:04:38.280> be<00:04:38.310> less<00:04:38.490> than<00:04:38.610> 2k<00:04:38.789> and<00:04:39.180> that<00:04:39.689> our<00:04:39.810> next

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
it'll be less than 2k and that our next

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.540 
it'll be less than 2k and that our next
might<00:04:40.199> is<00:04:40.349> a<00:04:40.379> 35<00:04:40.800> to<00:04:41.009> walk<00:04:41.189> and<00:04:41.370> we<00:04:41.430> never

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
might is a 35 to walk and we never

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.189 
might is a 35 to walk and we never
usually<00:04:41.789> do<00:04:42.030> 35<00:04:42.419> to<00:04:42.569> buy<00:04:42.750> was<00:04:42.900> literally<00:04:43.110> just

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 
usually do 35 to buy was literally just

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.439 
usually do 35 to buy was literally just
pretty<00:04:43.469> bored<00:04:43.650> so<00:04:43.889> went<00:04:44.340> into<00:04:44.460> 35<00:04:44.669> to<00:04:45.030> market

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:45.449 
pretty bored so went into 35 to market

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:48.110 
pretty bored so went into 35 to market
and<00:04:45.569> we<00:04:45.629> picked<00:04:45.780> up<00:04:45.900> him<00:04:46.050> 45.9<00:04:46.770> k<00:04:47.039> in<00:04:47.280> our<00:04:47.879> wing

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
and we picked up him 45.9 k in our wing

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.450 
and we picked up him 45.9 k in our wing
position<00:04:48.300> not<00:04:48.840> in<00:04:49.110> RM<00:04:49.590> but<00:04:49.979> we<00:04:50.069> saw<00:04:50.219> him<00:04:50.310> off<00:04:50.370> a

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
position not in RM but we saw him off a

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.179 
position not in RM but we saw him off a
7.1<00:04:50.879> k<00:04:51.150> which<00:04:51.330> returns<00:04:51.780> around<00:04:52.229> a<00:04:52.500> little<00:04:53.069> bit

00:04:53.179 --> 00:04:53.189 
7.1 k which returns around a little bit

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:54.860 
7.1 k which returns around a little bit
of<00:04:53.280> sonic<00:04:53.520> a<00:04:53.669> profit<00:04:54.090> maybe<00:04:54.270> not<00:04:54.479> leaving<00:04:54.750> that

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
of sonic a profit maybe not leaving that

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.540 
of sonic a profit maybe not leaving that
much<00:04:55.020> well<00:04:55.409> oxalate<00:04:55.770> didn't<00:04:56.009> sell<00:04:56.190> for<00:04:56.400> that

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
much well oxalate didn't sell for that

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:57.649 
much well oxalate didn't sell for that
price<00:04:56.819> so<00:04:56.969> we're<00:04:57.060> gonna<00:04:57.180> put<00:04:57.240> him<00:04:57.389> up<00:04:57.509> for<00:04:57.539> a

00:04:57.649 --> 00:04:57.659 
price so we're gonna put him up for a

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:59.899 
price so we're gonna put him up for a
little<00:04:57.780> bit<00:04:57.930> less<00:04:58.110> 2.8<00:04:58.889> k<00:04:59.099> and<00:04:59.310> hopefully<00:04:59.729> he

00:04:59.899 --> 00:04:59.909 
little bit less 2.8 k and hopefully he

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:01.219 
little bit less 2.8 k and hopefully he
will<00:05:00.060> say<00:05:00.330> in<00:05:00.389> the<00:05:00.479> next<00:05:00.569> byte<00:05:00.840> is<00:05:00.990> in<00:05:01.139> the

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
will say in the next byte is in the

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:16.159 
the last time we bought marker Royce he
