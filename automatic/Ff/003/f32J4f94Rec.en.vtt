is<00:03:02.959> fairly<00:03:03.380> early<00:03:03.530> on<00:03:03.800> it's<00:03:04.069> probably<00:03:04.130> like

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
is fairly early on it's probably like

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:05.650 
is fairly early on it's probably like
one<00:03:04.640> of<00:03:04.700> the<00:03:04.760> first<00:03:04.940> missions<00:03:05.269> in<00:03:05.390> the<00:03:05.420> game

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
one of the first missions in the game

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.050 
one of the first missions in the game
this<00:03:06.050> is<00:03:06.260> in<00:03:06.380> fact<00:03:06.410> the<00:03:06.739> first<00:03:07.010> mission<00:03:07.430> yes

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
this is in fact the first mission yes

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.620 
this is in fact the first mission yes
actually<00:03:08.480> it<00:03:08.540> is<00:03:08.690> um<00:03:09.069> so<00:03:10.269> moving<00:03:11.269> around<00:03:11.450> is

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
actually it is um so moving around is

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.569 
actually it is um so moving around is
very<00:03:11.810> similar<00:03:12.019> to<00:03:12.140> an<00:03:12.410> isometric<00:03:12.920> RPG<00:03:13.040> game

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
very similar to an isometric RPG game

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:15.160 
very similar to an isometric RPG game

of that that old school style but with
modern<00:04:23.780> function<00:04:24.789> as<00:04:25.789> we<00:04:26.000> look<00:04:26.120> at<00:04:26.210> combat

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
modern function as we look at combat

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.810 
modern function as we look at combat
here<00:04:26.750> is<00:04:26.840> a<00:04:26.870> perfect<00:04:27.320> example<00:04:27.410> Hendrick<00:04:27.979> yeah

here is a perfect example Hendrick yeah

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.460 
here is a perfect example Hendrick yeah
and<00:04:29.090> so<00:04:29.360> this<00:04:29.449> is<00:04:29.509> the<00:04:29.690> combat<00:04:30.050> system<00:04:30.199> it's

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
and so this is the combat system it's

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.980 
and so this is the combat system it's
very<00:04:30.620> turn-based<00:04:31.280> heavy<00:04:31.639> and<00:04:32.509> it's<00:04:32.630> very<00:04:32.780> nice

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
very turn-based heavy and it's very nice

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.590 
very turn-based heavy and it's very nice
and<00:04:33.259> I<00:04:33.560> grew<00:04:34.160> up<00:04:34.190> on<00:04:34.340> a<00:04:34.370> game<00:04:34.550> like<00:04:34.669> this<00:04:34.729> ball

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
and I grew up on a game like this ball

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.260 
and I grew up on a game like this ball
up<00:04:35.780> so<00:04:36.080> seeing<00:04:36.889> turn<00:04:37.550> based<00:04:37.729> games<00:04:37.970> come<00:04:38.240> back

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
up so seeing turn based games come back

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.210 
up so seeing turn based games come back
in<00:04:38.660> a<00:04:38.870> bit<00:04:39.020> of<00:04:39.050> resurgence<00:04:39.590> with<00:04:39.770> me<00:04:40.039> more

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
in a bit of resurgence with me more

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.050 
in a bit of resurgence with me more
recent<00:04:40.580> XCOM<00:04:41.330> games<00:04:41.660> and<00:04:42.490> that's<00:04:43.490> just<00:04:43.729> great

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
recent XCOM games and that's just great

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.230 
recent XCOM games and that's just great
now<00:04:45.050> the<00:04:45.080> one<00:04:45.349> thing<00:04:45.530> I<00:04:45.650> will<00:04:45.710> say<00:04:45.830> and<00:04:46.789> this<00:04:47.090> is

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
now the one thing I will say and this is

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.749 
now the one thing I will say and this is
like<00:04:47.389> my<00:04:47.509> only<00:04:47.660> biggest<00:04:48.380> gripe<00:04:49.039> with<00:04:49.370> the<00:04:49.580> game

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:49.759 
like my only biggest gripe with the game

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:52.990 
like my only biggest gripe with the game
is<00:04:50.199> a<00:04:51.199> lot<00:04:51.500> of<00:04:51.740> the<00:04:51.860> art<00:04:52.039> assets<00:04:52.430> seem<00:04:52.759> to<00:04:52.910> be

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
is a lot of the art assets seem to be

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.659 
is a lot of the art assets seem to be
reused<00:04:53.479> a<00:04:53.690> lot<00:04:54.020> but<00:04:54.650> I<00:04:54.710> do<00:04:54.830> attribute<00:04:55.310> that<00:04:55.520> to

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:55.669 
reused a lot but I do attribute that to

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:57.430 
reused a lot but I do attribute that to
more<00:04:55.970> of<00:04:56.120> it<00:04:56.240> being<00:04:56.419> an<00:04:56.599> indie<00:04:56.930> game<00:04:56.990> rather

points<00:06:00.169> and<00:06:00.349> so<00:06:01.220> began<00:06:01.460> again<00:06:01.880> it's<00:06:02.060> becoming

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:02.449 
points and so began again it's becoming

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:04.570 
points and so began again it's becoming
a<00:06:02.690> very<00:06:02.840> tactical<00:06:03.470> game<00:06:03.620> in<00:06:03.800> terms<00:06:04.070> of<00:06:04.250> combat

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580 
a very tactical game in terms of combat

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.300 
a very tactical game in terms of combat
and<00:06:04.970> fighting<00:06:05.599> against<00:06:05.840> the<00:06:05.990> AI<00:06:06.139> I<00:06:06.680> will<00:06:07.130> say

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
and fighting against the AI I will say

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.129 
and fighting against the AI I will say
one<00:06:07.340> of<00:06:07.610> the<00:06:07.669> things<00:06:07.909> in<00:06:08.180> the<00:06:08.389> game<00:06:08.570> that<00:06:08.900> I

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:09.139 
one of the things in the game that I

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:13.260 
one of the things in the game that I
both<00:06:09.979> love<00:06:10.370> and<00:06:10.550> hate<00:06:10.639> is<00:06:11.570> that<00:06:12.139> it<00:06:12.440> and

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270 
both love and hate is that it and

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.490 
both love and hate is that it and
perhaps<00:06:14.270> this<00:06:14.539> is<00:06:14.690> a<00:06:14.720> function<00:06:15.139> of<00:06:15.199> it<00:06:15.349> being

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:15.500 
perhaps this is a function of it being

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.620 
perhaps this is a function of it being
still<00:06:16.009> in<00:06:16.220> in<00:06:16.430> beta<00:06:16.669> and<00:06:16.820> not<00:06:17.030> you<00:06:17.210> know<00:06:17.240> full

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.170 
added to this game and still to be
iterated<00:06:21.229> on<00:06:21.320> is<00:06:21.590> that<00:06:22.279> it's<00:06:22.460> it's<00:06:22.760> a<00:06:22.909> game

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:23.180 
iterated on is that it's it's a game

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.550 
iterated on is that it's it's a game
which<00:06:23.570> I<00:06:24.760> found<00:06:25.760> to<00:06:26.060> be

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 
which I found to be

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.730 
which I found to be
refreshingly<00:06:27.550> challenging<00:06:28.540> but<00:06:29.139> also<00:06:29.350> in

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:29.740 
refreshingly challenging but also in

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.560 
refreshingly challenging but also in
some<00:06:30.040> senses<00:06:30.430> opaque<00:06:30.850> there's<00:06:31.330> a<00:06:31.389> lot<00:06:31.419> of

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:31.570 
some senses opaque there's a lot of

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.540 
some senses opaque there's a lot of
stuff<00:06:31.810> that<00:06:31.930> just<00:06:31.960> you<00:06:32.710> just<00:06:32.919> sort<00:06:33.070> of<00:06:33.160> dive<00:06:33.370> in

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:33.550 
stuff that just you just sort of dive in

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:35.280 
stuff that just you just sort of dive in
and<00:06:33.669> figure<00:06:33.880> out<00:06:34.000> as<00:06:34.240> you're<00:06:34.419> playing<00:06:34.540> and<00:06:34.900> I

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:35.290 
and figure out as you're playing and I

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:37.800 
and figure out as you're playing and I
love<00:06:35.530> that<00:06:35.710> a<00:06:35.740> lot<00:06:35.830> of<00:06:36.100> the<00:06:36.160> time<00:06:36.450> but<00:06:37.450> there

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:37.810 
love that a lot of the time but there

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.390 
love that a lot of the time but there
are<00:06:37.930> a<00:06:37.990> few<00:06:38.110> things<00:06:38.560> that<00:06:38.710> could<00:06:38.860> be<00:06:38.950> explained

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:39.400 
are a few things that could be explained

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.430 
are a few things that could be explained
a<00:06:39.520> little<00:06:39.820> bit<00:06:40.150> more<00:06:40.389> in<00:06:40.630> certain<00:06:41.050> areas<00:06:41.139> and

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440 
a little bit more in certain areas and

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.140 
a little bit more in certain areas and
I'm<00:06:41.560> frankly<00:06:42.370> struggling<00:06:42.730> to<00:06:42.820> come<00:06:42.880> up<00:06:42.940> with<00:06:43.090> a

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.150 
I'm frankly struggling to come up with a

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:46.170 
I'm frankly struggling to come up with a
specific<00:06:43.330> example<00:06:43.570> right<00:06:44.020> now<00:06:44.050> but<00:06:44.950> it's<00:06:45.880> just

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:46.180 
specific example right now but it's just

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.690 
specific example right now but it's just
sort<00:06:46.389> of<00:06:46.419> a<00:06:46.620> no<00:06:47.620> explaining<00:06:48.190> the<00:06:48.340> interface

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:48.700 
sort of a no explaining the interface

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:49.830 
sort of a no explaining the interface
and<00:06:48.880> things<00:06:49.060> like<00:06:49.150> that<00:06:49.210> a<00:06:49.389> little<00:06:49.540> bit<00:06:49.690> more

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:49.840 
and things like that a little bit more

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.470 
and things like that a little bit more
because<00:06:50.020> we're<00:06:50.740> not<00:06:51.010> used<00:06:51.340> to<00:06:51.460> having<00:06:51.700> this

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:52.480 
because we're not used to having this

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.870 
because we're not used to having this
full-featured<00:06:52.990> and<00:06:53.320> interface<00:06:53.650> in<00:06:54.370> older

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:54.880 
full-featured and interface in older

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.159 
full-featured and interface in older
games<00:06:55.120> of<00:06:55.330> this<00:06:55.450> type<00:06:55.510> because<00:06:56.050> the

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:56.169 
games of this type because the

00:06:56.169 --> 00:06:57.420 
games of this type because the
technology<00:06:56.320> couldn't<00:06:56.830> support<00:06:57.100> it<00:06:57.220> at<00:06:57.340> the

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:57.430 
technology couldn't support it at the

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.490 
technology couldn't support it at the
time<00:06:57.610> and<00:06:57.850> so<00:06:58.540> there<00:06:58.690> was<00:06:58.810> no<00:06:58.960> need<00:06:58.990> to<00:06:59.139> explain

00:06:59.490 --> 00:06:59.500 
time and so there was no need to explain

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.230 
time and so there was no need to explain
all<00:06:59.590> the<00:06:59.770> interface<00:07:00.100> back<00:07:00.340> then<00:07:00.550> but<00:07:00.850> maybe

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:01.240 
all the interface back then but maybe

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.420 
all the interface back then but maybe
there<00:07:01.450> is<00:07:01.570> no<00:07:01.770> but<00:07:02.770> yeah<00:07:02.889> that<00:07:03.070> was<00:07:03.220> our

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:03.430
