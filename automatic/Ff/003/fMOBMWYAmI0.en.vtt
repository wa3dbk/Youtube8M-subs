I've<00:02:21.710> just<00:02:21.920> started<00:02:22.130> the<00:02:22.370> fire<00:02:22.610> and<00:02:23.000> you<00:02:23.420> can

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
I've just started the fire and you can

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.420 
I've just started the fire and you can
see<00:02:23.720> that<00:02:23.870> it's<00:02:23.990> quite<00:02:24.200> a<00:02:24.230> strong<00:02:24.530> fire<00:02:24.860> and

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
see that it's quite a strong fire and

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.980 
see that it's quite a strong fire and
I'm<00:02:26.300> just<00:02:26.540> going<00:02:26.720> to<00:02:26.810> put<00:02:26.960> that<00:02:27.140> down<00:02:27.400> to<00:02:28.400> a

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
I'm just going to put that down to a

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.310 
I'm just going to put that down to a
slightly<00:02:29.990> larger<00:02:30.320> than<00:02:30.650> small<00:02:31.310> flame<00:02:32.260> okay<00:02:33.260> so

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
slightly larger than small flame okay so

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.140 
slightly larger than small flame okay so
not<00:02:33.590> quite<00:02:33.740> the<00:02:33.950> smallest<00:02:34.250> it<00:02:34.490> can<00:02:34.640> go<00:02:34.820> but

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
not quite the smallest it can go but

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.900 
not quite the smallest it can go but
fairly<00:02:35.390> small<00:02:35.810> now<00:02:36.800> we're<00:02:37.490> going<00:02:37.610> to<00:02:37.670> put<00:02:37.820> the

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
fairly small now we're going to put the

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.880 
fairly small now we're going to put the
pot<00:02:38.090> on<00:02:38.240> top<00:02:38.410> and<00:02:39.410> we're<00:02:39.500> going<00:02:39.620> to<00:02:39.680> put<00:02:39.860> just

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
pot on top and we're going to put just

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.830 
pot on top and we're going to put just
enough<00:02:41.050> chestnut<00:02:43.090> so<00:02:44.090> they<00:02:44.209> can<00:02:44.390> sit<00:02:44.630> at<00:02:44.780> the

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
enough chestnut so they can sit at the

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.320 
enough chestnut so they can sit at the
bottom<00:02:45.110> of<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.230> pan<00:02:45.760> the<00:02:46.760> reason<00:02:47.090> why<00:02:47.209> I'm

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
bottom of the pan the reason why I'm

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.449 
bottom of the pan the reason why I'm
using<00:02:47.360> a<00:02:47.720> small<00:02:48.110> flame<00:02:48.500> is<00:02:48.770> because<00:02:49.190> if<00:02:49.370> you

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
using a small flame is because if you

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.640 
using a small flame is because if you
use<00:02:49.580> a<00:02:49.610> high<00:02:50.390> flame<00:02:50.690> you're<00:02:51.200> just<00:02:51.380> going<00:02:51.500> to<00:02:51.530> be

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
use a high flame you're just going to be

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.560 
use a high flame you're just going to be
cooking<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.100> outside<00:02:52.550> and<00:02:52.820> you<00:02:53.239> won't<00:02:53.420> give

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
cooking the outside and you won't give

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.930 
cooking the outside and you won't give
it<00:02:53.660> enough<00:02:53.840> time<00:02:53.870> to<00:02:54.410> cook<00:02:54.650> into<00:02:55.100> steam<00:02:55.459> inside

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
it enough time to cook into steam inside

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.030 
it enough time to cook into steam inside
so<00:02:56.239> we're<00:02:56.390> steaming<00:02:56.840> and<00:02:56.959> roasting<00:02:57.620> the

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
so we're steaming and roasting the

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.390 
so we're steaming and roasting the
chestnuts<00:02:58.550> at<00:02:58.700> the<00:02:58.790> same<00:02:59.030> time<00:02:59.890> now<00:03:00.890> chestnuts

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
chestnuts at the same time now chestnuts

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.330 
chestnuts at the same time now chestnuts
are<00:03:01.610> a<00:03:01.670> starchy<00:03:02.510> not<00:03:03.050> so<00:03:03.650> they<00:03:03.770> contain<00:03:04.100> lots

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
are a starchy not so they contain lots

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.330 
are a starchy not so they contain lots
of<00:03:04.459> carbohydrates<00:03:05.170> that<00:03:06.170> contains<00:03:06.530> quite<00:03:07.310> a

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
of carbohydrates that contains quite a

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.240 
of carbohydrates that contains quite a
bit<00:03:07.489> of<00:03:07.580> protein<00:03:07.970> as<00:03:08.150> well<00:03:08.360> and<00:03:08.630> some<00:03:09.290> fat<00:03:09.620> but

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
bit of protein as well and some fat but

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.010 
bit of protein as well and some fat but
the<00:03:10.370> fat<00:03:10.550> is<00:03:10.700> actually<00:03:10.850> a<00:03:11.120> good<00:03:11.450> fat<00:03:11.690> and<00:03:11.930> it's

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
the fat is actually a good fat and it's

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.750 
the fat is actually a good fat and it's
been<00:03:12.170> shown<00:03:12.440> to<00:03:12.620> decrease<00:03:12.800> cholesterol<00:03:13.220> as

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
been shown to decrease cholesterol as

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.240 
been shown to decrease cholesterol as
well<00:03:14.050> so<00:03:15.050> we're<00:03:15.230> going<00:03:15.260> to<00:03:15.410> leave<00:03:15.650> this<00:03:15.860> on<00:03:16.100> the

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
well so we're going to leave this on the

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.000 
well so we're going to leave this on the
fire<00:03:16.459> and<00:03:16.730> give<00:03:16.910> it<00:03:17.000> a<00:03:17.090> turn<00:03:17.330> every<00:03:17.780> say<00:03:18.380> four

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
fire and give it a turn every say four

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.490 
fire and give it a turn every say four
or<00:03:19.040> five<00:03:19.190> minutes<00:03:19.760> and<00:03:20.180> I<00:03:20.810> think<00:03:21.080> the<00:03:21.170> total

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
or five minutes and I think the total

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.500 
or five minutes and I think the total
time<00:03:21.709> will<00:03:21.920> be<00:03:22.040> about<00:03:22.250> 20<00:03:22.700> minutes<00:03:23.000> to<00:03:23.299> 30

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
time will be about 20 minutes to 30

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.330 
time will be about 20 minutes to 30
minutes<00:03:23.600> to<00:03:24.019> cook<00:03:24.200> them<00:03:24.440> but<00:03:24.920> I'll<00:03:25.040> time<00:03:25.310> it

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
minutes to cook them but I'll time it

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.670 
minutes to cook them but I'll time it
and<00:03:25.700> let's<00:03:25.910> see<00:03:26.060> how<00:03:26.209> we<00:03:26.269> go<00:03:29.500> okay<00:03:30.500> they've

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
and let's see how we go okay they've

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.270 
and let's see how we go okay they've
been<00:03:31.040> going<00:03:31.310> for<00:03:31.489> about<00:03:32.500> 15<00:03:33.500> minutes<00:03:33.769> now<00:03:33.830> you

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
been going for about 15 minutes now you

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.720 
been going for about 15 minutes now you
can<00:03:34.940> see<00:03:35.209> the<00:03:35.660> outside<00:03:36.140> of<00:03:36.500> the<00:03:37.130> skin<00:03:37.370> is

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
can see the outside of the skin is

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.330 
can see the outside of the skin is
starting<00:03:38.150> to<00:03:38.330> turn<00:03:38.630> like<00:03:39.019> a<00:03:39.080> golden<00:03:39.620> brown<00:03:39.980> and

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
starting to turn like a golden brown and

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.090 
starting to turn like a golden brown and
a<00:03:40.400> little<00:03:40.910> bit<00:03:41.180> black<00:03:41.769> they're<00:03:42.769> going<00:03:42.920> to<00:03:42.980> go<00:03:43.070> a

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
a little bit black they're going to go a

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.530 
a little bit black they're going to go a
lot<00:03:43.310> blacker<00:03:43.640> by<00:03:43.910> the<00:03:43.970> time<00:03:44.209> they're<00:03:44.420> finished

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
lot blacker by the time they're finished

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.350 
lot blacker by the time they're finished
roasting<00:03:45.220> you'll<00:03:46.220> also<00:03:46.400> notice<00:03:46.790> that<00:03:46.970> they

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
roasting you'll also notice that they

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.259 
roasting you'll also notice that they
start<00:03:47.690> to<00:03:47.810> split<00:03:48.170> open<00:03:48.260> as<00:03:48.620> well<00:03:48.890> and<00:03:49.340> that's

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
start to split open as well and that's

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:51.759 
start to split open as well and that's
perfectly<00:03:50.690> fine<00:03:50.959> it's<00:03:51.230> just<00:03:51.290> a<00:03:51.530> steam

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
perfectly fine it's just a steam

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.370 
perfectly fine it's just a steam
escaping<00:03:52.220> as<00:03:52.489> they<00:03:52.700> cook<00:03:52.940> thoroughly<00:03:53.840> inside

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
escaping as they cook thoroughly inside

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.410
