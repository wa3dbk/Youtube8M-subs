today we are doing a quick review of the

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.960 
today we are doing a quick review of the
RPM<00:00:15.120> fitness<00:00:15.599> speed<00:00:15.960> rope<00:00:16.230> 2.0<00:00:16.859> now<00:00:17.550> I've<00:00:17.820> been

RPM fitness speed rope 2.0 now I've been

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.330 
RPM fitness speed rope 2.0 now I've been
seeing<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.449> lot<00:00:18.810> of<00:00:18.869> high-profile<00:00:19.800> athletes

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
seeing a lot of high-profile athletes

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.929 
seeing a lot of high-profile athletes
using<00:00:20.820> this<00:00:21.210> jump<00:00:21.930> rope<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.320> actually<00:00:23.100> it<00:00:23.880> has

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
using this jump rope and actually it has

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.060 
using this jump rope and actually it has
a<00:00:24.090> four<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.660> half<00:00:24.689> star<00:00:25.019> rating<00:00:25.050> on<00:00:25.619> Amazon

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
so I was kind of wondering what's the

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.570 
so I was kind of wondering what's the
deal<00:00:27.750> with<00:00:27.990> this<00:00:28.140> guy<00:00:28.380> so<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.010> picked<00:00:29.250> one<00:00:29.429> up

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
deal with this guy so I picked one up

some of you are probably saying hey Jeff
it's<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.489> jump<00:00:35.760> rope<00:00:35.910> how<00:00:36.719> much<00:00:36.960> can<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:37.230> talk

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
it's a jump rope how much can you talk

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.930 
it's a jump rope how much can you talk
about<00:00:37.620> with<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.950> jump<00:00:38.160> rope<00:00:38.219> well<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:38.760> turns

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
about with the jump rope well it turns

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.270 
about with the jump rope well it turns
out<00:00:39.149> not<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.719> lot<00:00:39.840> but<00:00:40.260> there<00:00:40.379> are<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.559> few<00:00:41.070> things

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
out not a lot but there are a few things

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.310 
out not a lot but there are a few things
that<00:00:41.610> I<00:00:41.790> do<00:00:41.940> want<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.480> highlight<00:00:42.629> number<00:00:43.079> one

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
that I do want to highlight number one

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.889 
that I do want to highlight number one
the<00:00:43.890> handle<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.550> incredibly<00:00:45.539> lightweight

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
the handle is incredibly lightweight

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.720 
the handle is incredibly lightweight
it's<00:00:46.260> actually<00:00:46.559> hollow<00:00:46.860> so<00:00:47.489> when<00:00:47.640> you're

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
it's actually hollow so when you're

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.430 
it's actually hollow so when you're
doing<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.059> lot<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.239> double<00:00:48.660> unders<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.170> triple

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
doing a lot of double unders and triple

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.250 
doing a lot of double unders and triple
unders<00:00:49.710> or<00:00:49.920> whatever<00:00:50.250> your<00:00:51.059> forearms<00:00:51.840> aren't

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
unders or whatever your forearms aren't

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.799 
unders or whatever your forearms aren't
getting<00:00:52.590> fatigued<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:54.210> really<00:00:54.510> like<00:00:54.660> the

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
getting fatigued and I really like the

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:55.970 
getting fatigued and I really like the
fact<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.110> it's<00:00:55.289> lightweight<00:00:55.620> there<00:00:55.829> are<00:00:55.949> a

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
fact that it's lightweight there are a

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.529 
fact that it's lightweight there are a
bunch<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.340> jump<00:00:56.579> ropes<00:00:56.850> out<00:00:56.969> there<00:00:57.210> where<00:00:57.449> it's

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
bunch of jump ropes out there where it's

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.619 
bunch of jump ropes out there where it's
like<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.690> chore<00:00:58.140> just<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.739> rotate<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.820> the

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
like a chore just to rotate that and the

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.510 
like a chore just to rotate that and the
handle<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.079> very<00:01:01.440> very<00:01:01.680> heavy<00:01:01.829> not<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.309> case

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
handle is very very heavy not the case

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.750 
handle is very very heavy not the case
with<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.719> speed<00:01:04.110> rope<00:01:04.290> 2.0<00:01:04.739> also<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.489> has

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
with the speed rope 2.0 also it has

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.850 
with the speed rope 2.0 also it has
neuro-link<00:01:06.390> on<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.540> outside<00:01:06.869> so<00:01:07.140> it's<00:01:07.619> really

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
neuro-link on the outside so it's really

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.469 
neuro-link on the outside so it's really
grippy<00:01:08.310> it's<00:01:08.460> not<00:01:08.640> going<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.880> slide<00:01:09.240> out<00:01:09.450> of

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
grippy it's not going to slide out of

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.050 
grippy it's not going to slide out of
your<00:01:09.630> hands<00:01:10.110> definitely<00:01:10.710> like<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.400> then

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
your hands definitely like that and then

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.149 
your hands definitely like that and then
the<00:01:12.330> locking<00:01:12.900> mechanism<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.650> really<00:01:13.979> really

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
the locking mechanism is really really

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.789 
the locking mechanism is really really
great<00:01:14.490> so<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.390> cable<00:01:15.750> slides<00:01:16.049> through<00:01:16.380> here

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
great so the cable slides through here

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.499 
great so the cable slides through here
and<00:01:16.920> then<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.430> connects<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.970> little<00:01:18.270> ball

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
and then it connects to the little ball

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.330 
and then it connects to the little ball
that<00:01:18.720> rotates<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.409> then<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:19.860> can<00:01:20.009> clip<00:01:20.250> it

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
that rotates and then you can clip it

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.859 
that rotates and then you can clip it
off<00:01:20.460> at<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.700> end<00:01:20.729> so<00:01:21.030> there's<00:01:21.210> no<00:01:21.360> excess

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
off at the end so there's no excess

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.289 
off at the end so there's no excess
cable<00:01:22.350> that's<00:01:22.590> sitting<00:01:23.369> there<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.820> cut<00:01:24.060> you

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
cable that's sitting there to cut you

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.760 
cable that's sitting there to cut you
and<00:01:24.540> whip<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:24.990> that<00:01:25.110> sort<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.409> stuff<00:01:25.590> I

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
and whip you and that sort of stuff I

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.440 
and whip you and that sort of stuff I
like<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.340> fact<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.939> can<00:01:27.060> be<00:01:27.090> hidden

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
like the fact that it can be hidden

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.200 
like the fact that it can be hidden
inside<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:28.619> handle<00:01:29.009> here<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.460> then<00:01:30.030> also

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
inside the handle here and then also

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.719 
inside the handle here and then also
related<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.530> rotates<00:01:32.040> really<00:01:32.490> really

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
related to that it rotates really really

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:33.230 
related to that it rotates really really
fast

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
fast

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.719 
fast
this<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.780> quick<00:01:34.200> jump<00:01:34.470> rope<00:01:34.950> hence<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.549> name

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
this is a quick jump rope hence the name

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.870 
this is a quick jump rope hence the name
rpm<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:36.960> I've<00:01:37.560> been<00:01:37.680> very<00:01:37.979> very<00:01:38.220> happy<00:01:38.700> with

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
rpm and I've been very very happy with

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:39.050 
rpm and I've been very very happy with
it

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
it

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.910 
it
definitely<00:01:39.930> one<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.350> best<00:01:40.500> feed<00:01:40.710> ropes

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
definitely one of the best feed ropes

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.410 
definitely one of the best feed ropes
I've<00:01:41.100> tested<00:01:41.460> out<00:01:41.549> one<00:01:41.790> word<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.180> warning

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
I've tested out one word of warning

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.499 
I've tested out one word of warning
though<00:01:42.840> if<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.860> get<00:01:44.040> this<00:01:44.189> guy<00:01:44.369> go<00:01:45.210> with<00:01:45.360> the

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
though if you get this guy go with the

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.539 
though if you get this guy go with the
coated<00:01:45.990> cable<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.560> went<00:01:46.950> with<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.159> uncoated

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
coated cable I went with the uncoated

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.100 
coated cable I went with the uncoated
cable<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.180> do<00:01:48.240> think<00:01:48.570> it's<00:01:48.659> going<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.840> fray

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
cable and I do think it's going to fray

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.800 
cable and I do think it's going to fray
quicker<00:01:49.500> still<00:01:50.369> though<00:01:50.579> make<00:01:51.240> sure<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.630> use

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
quicker still though make sure you use

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.510 
quicker still though make sure you use
it<00:01:51.960> inside<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.649> you're<00:01:52.740> not<00:01:52.890> using<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.340> like

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
it inside and you're not using it like

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.789 
it inside and you're not using it like
on<00:01:53.700> asphalt<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.390> on<00:01:54.600> rough<00:01:54.899> surfaces<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:55.590> will

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
on asphalt and on rough surfaces it will

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.789 
on asphalt and on rough surfaces it will
fray<00:01:56.240> like<00:01:57.240> pretty<00:01:57.810> much<00:01:57.869> immediately<00:01:58.439> so

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
fray like pretty much immediately so

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.920 
fray like pretty much immediately so
definitely<00:01:59.310> use<00:01:59.549> this<00:01:59.700> inside<00:02:00.479> your<00:02:00.659> gym
