00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
it's in their stability category so it

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.800 
it's in their stability category so it

didn't<00:00:27.990> realize<00:00:28.170> that<00:00:28.560> Newton's<00:00:28.949> always<00:00:29.189> been

minimalist<00:00:31.769> thing<00:00:31.920> started<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.579> what<00:00:33.540> they

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
minimalist thing started and what they

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.270 
minimalist thing started and what they
said<00:00:33.870> is<00:00:34.050> sometimes<00:00:34.440> they<00:00:34.620> had<00:00:34.739> had<00:00:34.920> rubber

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
said is sometimes they had had rubber

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.010 
said is sometimes they had had rubber
that<00:00:35.460> came<00:00:35.670> up<00:00:35.700> over<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.210> side<00:00:36.420> wall<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:36.840> it

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
that came up over the side wall so it

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.049 
that came up over the side wall so it
was<00:00:37.290> misleading<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.670> looked<00:00:38.969> a

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
was misleading that it it looked a

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.900 
was misleading that it it looked a
little<00:00:39.239> more<00:00:39.540> substantial<00:00:40.500> four<00:00:41.489> millimeter

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910

kicking<00:00:47.160> colors<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:48.379> you<00:00:49.379> can<00:00:49.530> see<00:00:49.559> how

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
kicking colors is you can see how

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.279 
kicking colors is you can see how
aerated<00:00:50.760> they've<00:00:51.210> lightened<00:00:51.480> this<00:00:51.780> up<00:00:52.050> or

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
aerated they've lightened this up or

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.459 
aerated they've lightened this up or
even<00:00:52.469> more<00:00:53.250> in<00:00:54.210> some<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:55.020> their<00:00:55.140> training

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
even more in some of their training

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.950 
even more in some of their training
shoes<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.190> it's<00:00:56.640> just<00:00:56.850> not<00:00:57.480> only<00:00:57.780> does<00:00:57.930> it

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
shoes and it's just not only does it

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.349 
shoes and it's just not only does it
make<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.230> totally<00:00:58.949> lightweight<00:00:59.190> shoe<00:00:59.640> but<00:01:00.180> it's

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
make a totally lightweight shoe but it's

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.349 
make a totally lightweight shoe but it's
a<00:01:00.510> nice<00:01:00.989> going<00:01:01.500> shoe<00:01:01.710> for<00:01:02.039> basically<00:01:02.760> three

seasons may be cold in the winter if
you're<00:01:06.510> someplace<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:07.080> gets<00:01:07.229> pretty<00:01:07.350> cold<00:01:07.619> but

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
you're someplace it gets pretty cold but

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.740 
you're someplace it gets pretty cold but
right<00:01:08.040> now<00:01:08.220> starting<00:01:09.060> in<00:01:09.119> February<00:01:09.540> and

leading into spring and summer it's

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.469 
leading into spring and summer it's
going<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.400> be<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.520> really<00:01:11.700> good<00:01:11.880> training<00:01:12.180> shoe

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
going to be a really good training shoe

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.380 
going to be a really good training shoe
they<00:01:13.260> always<00:01:13.500> have<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:14.340> lever<00:01:14.580> system<00:01:14.850> on<00:01:15.240> the

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
they always have the lever system on the

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.039 
they always have the lever system on the

forefoot of the soup helping you learn

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.560 
forefoot of the soup helping you learn
how<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.409> be<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.680> more<00:01:19.979> efficient<00:01:20.460> runner<00:01:20.970> it's<00:01:21.420> a

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
how to be a more efficient runner it's a

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.410 
how to be a more efficient runner it's a
size<00:01:21.810> 10<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.470> others<00:01:23.159> on<00:01:23.490> their<00:01:23.850> site<00:01:24.180> they'll

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
size 10 and others on their site they'll

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.520 
size 10 and others on their site they'll
tell<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.900> lot<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.049> times<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.409> would

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
tell you that a lot of times you would

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.649 
tell you that a lot of times you would
go<00:01:25.680> up<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:26.040> half<00:01:26.220> I'm<00:01:26.729> always<00:01:27.030> between<00:01:27.420> nine<00:01:27.630> and

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
go up a half I'm always between nine and

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.510 
go up a half I'm always between nine and
a<00:01:27.810> half<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.110> 10<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:28.500> 10<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:28.770> great<00:01:29.040> for<00:01:29.280> me<00:01:29.430> to

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
a half and 10 so 10 is great for me to

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.100 
a half and 10 so 10 is great for me to
chain<00:01:29.759> in<00:01:29.909> but<00:01:30.360> i<00:01:30.390> think<00:01:30.689> i<00:01:30.810> could<00:01:30.869> actually

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
chain in but i think i could actually

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.749 
chain in but i think i could actually
chain<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.530> nine<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.070> half<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.430> be<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.579> little

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
chain a nine and a half and be a little

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.670 
chain a nine and a half and be a little
more<00:01:32.880> form-fitting<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:34.259> know<00:01:34.380> kind<00:01:34.619> of

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
more form-fitting so you know kind of

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.899 
more form-fitting so you know kind of
make<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:35.009> decision<00:01:35.310> on<00:01:35.579> your<00:01:35.640> own<00:01:35.790> I

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
make that decision on your own I

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.179 
make that decision on your own I
wouldn't<00:01:36.390> say<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.570> they<00:01:36.869> run<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.439> half<00:01:37.920> size

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
wouldn't say that they run a half size

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.880 
wouldn't say that they run a half size
they<00:01:38.729> might<00:01:38.909> run<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.180> quarter<00:01:39.630> size<00:01:39.810> big<00:01:40.170> for<00:01:40.770> me

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
they might run a quarter size big for me

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.249 
they might run a quarter size big for me
so<00:01:41.130> I'm<00:01:41.400> kind<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:41.759> in<00:01:42.000> between<00:01:42.180> there<00:01:42.659> there's

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
so I'm kind of in between there there's

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.780 
so I'm kind of in between there there's
so<00:01:43.470> much<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.799> tell<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.009> about<00:01:44.189> Newton's<00:01:44.670> that

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
so much to tell you about Newton's that

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.010 
so much to tell you about Newton's that

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
from Hilda toe boots for it when you go

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.460 
from Hilda toe boots for it when you go
to<00:02:10.009> toe<00:02:10.280> off<00:02:10.490> then<00:02:10.759> you<00:02:11.330> hop<00:02:11.660> back<00:02:11.900> on<00:02:12.260> these

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
to toe off then you hop back on these

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.460 
to toe off then you hop back on these
and<00:02:12.740> you<00:02:12.830> get<00:02:12.980> a<00:02:13.010> reaction<00:02:13.430> a<00:02:13.670> lot<00:02:13.700> of

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
and you get a reaction a lot of

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.620 
and you get a reaction a lot of
responsiveness<00:02:15.470> to<00:02:15.860> it<00:02:16.010> and<00:02:16.160> so<00:02:16.700> it's<00:02:17.209> a<00:02:17.360> quick

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
responsiveness to it and so it's a quick

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.540 
responsiveness to it and so it's a quick

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
lot of cushion because they're actually

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.320 
lot of cushion because they're actually

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
absorbing shock in these lugs and then

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:31.610 
absorbing shock in these lugs and then
returning<00:02:23.750> that
