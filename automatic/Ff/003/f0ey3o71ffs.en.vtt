00:00:10.479 --> 00:00:13.769
 as another innovation today, there is a lot 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:16.769
 around the program 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:21.569
 stunden OK and indeed I have a user proposed topics Fashion 

00:00:21.569 --> 00:00:23.599
 TV Hochdorf the camera 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:26.729
 then I have the title that everyone can do 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.469
 and you have nothing so if z there it is here 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.560
 yes so serve him strongly in the descriptions and must give 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.620
 I do not have the topic 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.860
 VOX objects OK 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.210
 Everything can be like that 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.580
 Watson and years ago for the first time now he has the hallway around 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.740
 you can stop there percent 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.930
 Kerner possible attitude change so he reminds the 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.070
 Version article costs then of course also Katie and so on 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.560
 Change yourself with Photoshop or something 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.850
 Amanda tended to pack up for the goal 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.590
 and I can not have that "free and fair sion" any easier 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.920
 Write the left side for a long time and if you can do it all the time you can 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.980
 out 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.450
 and Settings percent and Bonns training more at the moment 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.380
 and you can set it here 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.800
 the 11th 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.820
 after Kleist the rounds 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.230
 should disappear if, for example 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.250
 under Settings here 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.720
 wants to move the whole down 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.720
 because then if the taskbar Darreh from 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.060
 that was wrong 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.490
 then it looks a bit 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.580
 stupid 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.420
 so 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.820
 Kammann 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.260
 the taskbar disappear and then you have one too 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.820
 Percent of these 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.220
 I give them life 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.069
 Of course you can do it the way I did 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.969
 I'm not doing it right now 

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:11.829
 you leave that 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:14.389
 almost lighter and packs the whole thing 

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:17.059
 up 

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:18.259
 around 

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:21.259
 and usually 

00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:24.779
 is it that way 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.400
 so that usually does not go away so Stay Fire 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.379
 Water should be with the mouse so Langenbrinck came very from the top and 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.939
 Normally that's just set so that it's just the whole 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:40.900
 Time is here and it looks like it just like me 

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:44.279
 you learn that it was worth it 

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:47.279
 on the loupe and then so old 

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:52.349
 and then when i go about it geo and when i do not go with it anymore 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:53.909
 mine often liked 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:56.909
 around land and really another attitude and the 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.569
 yes, although supposedly so 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:03.999
 and here we are also interested 

00:03:03.999 --> 00:03:06.529
 No, for example 

00:03:06.529 --> 00:03:08.759
 Rome is in it 

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:11.759
 Oh nonsense such only the changed Thuringia 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.209
 we have to leave it that way though 

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:22.059
 You can change the animal 

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:23.269
 well there 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.419
 that is, for example, appears here or you can, of course, too 

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:30.479
 to make appear right 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:34.109
 or as I said 

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:38.179
 Soil animals wait below 

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:41.179
 Doro at the moment my taskbar is 11 o'clock opening 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:45.349
 I have my degree 

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:49.109
 that 's how they are 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:52.929
 playfully I am now at what you as a member 

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:56.549
 with this option this will also do anything with this program 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.959
 Yes and 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.099
 mm we have some options here 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:04.559
 Year you can do that 

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:07.679
 Anderson was centered all year 

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:11.679
 But this is what should happen when you move the mouse over it 

00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:13.029
 with the austro-pop 

00:04:13.029 --> 00:04:14.159
 around 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:18.689
 you can set it so that you are going to grow up to Dr 

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:22.539
 Size as it happens at the beginning of a long ship in 60 so then 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:26.029
 not firstly but with the standard size at 128 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.830
 and at the European Championships 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.199
 at the beginning size of their own company did not go over it 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:35.479
 now we can also leave us crude at 64 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:38.949
 or send all inserts, of course, there are also larger windows 

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:40.509
 make blind 

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:42.009
 around 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:43.900
 or shrink for 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.900
 after one for him 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.379
 Most of them were extra blind Christmas 

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:54.379
 m always not alone Corner 

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:57.900
 Here, transparency could be set 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.590
 is constant 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.590
 transparent but I'll leave it that way 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.449
 was here 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:08.520
 but a nice choice, namely the borders 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.099
 Dirk Brandt 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:13.659
 you can just click through it 

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:16.659
 we are so front yard 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.880
 it does not look bad but that does not work out that bad either 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.389
 always like that 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:25.150
 m the workers to the effects 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.800
 no effects do not happen if you also see it for that 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.870
 becomes 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.050
 Program to buy up the 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.029
 Yes 

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:36.409
 could also try everything 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:38.259
 light up 

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:39.669
 it wobbles 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:42.669
 b 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:45.099
 Performer Jenaer years 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:48.419
 something with car tires 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:51.419
 Pauli is always the photo is pronounced 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:56.479
 despite or so 

00:05:58.349 --> 00:05:59.909
 he had on 

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:01.749
 supposedly to let that 

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:05.330
 yes the other so more effects that I wanted to show you 

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:11.979
 and yes not 5 percent not bad the book on and the further deadline 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:15.289
 for example, your program can move in there as well as in the middle 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:15.809
 move 

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:18.710
 Of course you can take off and 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.610
 min ufffff 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.360
 then they are gone again 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.699
 around him 

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:27.089
 and I hope 

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:29.969
 Eurostat should like quickly if not then 

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:33.909
 Frattini directive criticism and Monika mental pay 

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:35.860
 if such has dropped then 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.889
 It writes the thought come positive percent 

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:40.529
 positive criticism 

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:43.229
 cut it off 

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:46.110
 I'm off again so whether 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.650
 Today drive on the road to the abyss than last 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:06.659
 it is like it is
