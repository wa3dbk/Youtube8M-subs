00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.370
 even mess this video though 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.050

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.630

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:21.390
 you to see the contents 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:24.019
 then I removed the first envelope 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.140
 as you can see and I got a little 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:29.279
 scrunched 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:36.630
 unfortunately I will have to throw the box but 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:41.550
 shoes are these shoes are 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:43.620
 these I want you in surgery 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.780
 here my granddaughter likes them 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:53.399
 making and task meanwhile greets you 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:55.379
 we are in with the cousin finally me 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.559
 I found these shoes I was 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.559
 waiting for 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.320
 and now we will try to see how 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.270
 will go the first time I order 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.000
 actually online shoes so I don't know 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.030
 like how they can stand me and if the numbers 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.930
 they wander well therefore a 39 le is ordered 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.640
 we will try and see for a moment 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.990
 here we are then you saw the shoes 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.960
 that came to me from China 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.720
 I can take photos with the complete fit 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.060
 the shoes that matched this 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.420
 This is very light here 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.420
 summer 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.490
 and meanwhile on the lips or the number is 306 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.510
 padel line type but the new line 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:49.150
 to the soul of pupa and on the nails instead 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:51.330
 I used this effect and enamel 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.330
 gel 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:02:01.420
 I hope we can see well and 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:04.390
 this is the number 39 poppi red after that 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:09.000
 applied to ruin it 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:13.950
 the doc ot of the gel look 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.950
 sip ruin it because unfortunately this 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.940
 this top coat is actually ruining me 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.650
 every kind of saint I try every time 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.950
 I call the types of enamels to see 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.560
 if maybe it can work better with a 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.180
 type rather than that with another is 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.400
 instead the effect that I keep is always the same 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:34.480
 that is, I applied the enamel 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.880
 last night is how you can see if already 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.000
 chipped and this is absolutely wrong 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.700
 also good because I want to tell you not 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.280
 they still did nothing to be able 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.750
 ruining the nail polish I did n't hold my hands 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.900
 we go there to put the water I did not 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.510
 nothing special so i want 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.269
 say how this touch ruins this 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.260
 of enamels a hallucinating thing 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:59.410
 however speaking instead of this 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.510
 enamel here this enamel I must say that it is 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:05.440
 beautiful I really like the color 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.180
 because from a really shiny effect yes 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.980
 spreads very smoothly because it has a 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.370
 big brush now I'm also looking for 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:17.350
 let you see it 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:19.030
 here it is, and it is crying and thick and it lies down 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.040
 really very well it would be enough 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.930
 but a past I prefer terni 2 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.670
 because the glaze with two passes me 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.350
 like it a lot more because it wasn't the 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.170
 smaller more covering an effect more 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.420
 brilliant so I prefer anyway 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.580
 apply two coats and then if you want 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.290
 spoil the whole used top course 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.760
 coat otherwise leave it out why 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.760
 actually the enamel was already so good 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.310
 me trying to protect him e 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.200
 however to leave the gel effect ho 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.680
 wanted to use that because or that 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.420
 of the kiko however sincerely I do not me 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.959
 I feel good for nothing, I don't like it 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:56.920
 absolutely it really is really from 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:59.950
 throw it away because I'm sorry to throw it away 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.930
 because in any case he does n't like to taste i 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.880
 products even if I paid very little 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.769
 so even if I throw it I mean 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.079
 never mind, however, it is money spent 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:10.150
 and honestly it would be like taking 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:11.500
 anyway money and throw them away 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.709
 directly in the trash of the 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.660
 garbage and this in my opinion does not go 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:19.209
 well anyway 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:22.780
 in this video I didn't want to tell you about 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:26.230
 all this within this video was for 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.660

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.520

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:45.280
 together then the winner flare snow 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.450
 it was flared no you won the mascara 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.240
