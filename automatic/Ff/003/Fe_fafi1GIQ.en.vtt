00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.620 
directly from this experience that I
decided<00:03:05.590> to<00:03:07.020> write<00:03:08.020> that<00:03:08.260> manual<00:03:08.800> and<00:03:09.070> to<00:03:09.630> try

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
decided to write that manual and to try

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.620 
decided to write that manual and to try
and<00:03:10.980> multiply<00:03:12.270> what

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.470 

what<00:03:16.290> other<00:03:16.590> people<00:03:16.980> have<00:03:17.130> done<00:03:17.340> in<00:03:17.910> order<00:03:18.150> to

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
what other people have done in order to

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.800 
what other people have done in order to
give<00:03:19.200> others<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.650> template<00:03:20.340> for<00:03:20.690> doing<00:03:21.690> that

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
give others the template for doing that

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.080 
give others the template for doing that
so<00:03:21.990> let's<00:03:22.140> take<00:03:22.260> a<00:03:22.290> walk<00:03:22.530> or<00:03:22.830> a<00:03:22.890> drive<00:03:22.980> down<00:03:23.550> 76
