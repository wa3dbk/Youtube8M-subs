00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:04.910 
technics is a here that we've
experimented<00:00:03.030> with<00:00:03.480> a<00:00:03.540> bit<00:00:03.840> before<00:00:04.200> we<00:00:04.380> played

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
experimented with a bit before we played

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.710 
experimented with a bit before we played
it<00:00:05.069> than<00:00:05.250> inscribes<00:00:05.879> and<00:00:06.180> we<00:00:06.240> also<00:00:06.359> try<00:00:06.600> that

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
it than inscribes and we also try that

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.560 
it than inscribes and we also try that
once<00:00:06.870> in<00:00:07.080> DC<00:00:07.410> but<00:00:08.309> back<00:00:08.940> then<00:00:08.970> we<00:00:09.210> just<00:00:09.389> played

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
once in DC but back then we just played

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.780 
once in DC but back then we just played
it<00:00:09.660> as<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:09.780> single<00:00:10.110> offer<00:00:10.400> but<00:00:11.400> then<00:00:11.519> recently

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
it as a single offer but then recently

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.820 
it as a single offer but then recently
if<00:00:11.969> we<00:00:12.269> found<00:00:12.480> out<00:00:12.570> that<00:00:12.599> if<00:00:13.170> you<00:00:13.320> put<00:00:13.469> one<00:00:13.679> here

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
if we found out that if you put one here

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.129 
if we found out that if you put one here
with<00:00:14.070> techies<00:00:14.460> you're<00:00:15.150> doing<00:00:15.480> enough<00:00:15.750> it's

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
with techies you're doing enough it's

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.340 
with techies you're doing enough it's
very<00:00:16.320> strong<00:00:16.529> so<00:00:17.220> say<00:00:18.000> so<00:00:18.060> up<00:00:18.390> like<00:00:18.660> three

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
very strong so say so up like three

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.560 
very strong so say so up like three
games<00:00:19.529> in<00:00:19.680> our<00:00:19.770> group<00:00:19.949> we<00:00:20.279> just<00:00:20.490> wanted<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.789> do

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
games in our group we just wanted to do

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.509 
games in our group we just wanted to do
try<00:00:21.779> it<00:00:21.840> out<00:00:21.960> because<00:00:22.560> we<00:00:22.830> had<00:00:22.949> some<00:00:23.130> you<00:00:23.460> know

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
try it out because we had some you know

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.140 
try it out because we had some you know
we<00:00:23.699> had<00:00:23.850> some<00:00:24.380> time<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.410> experiment<00:00:25.800> I<00:00:26.460> think

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
we had some time to experiment I think

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.330 
we had some time to experiment I think
it's<00:00:27.300> mostly<00:00:28.019> because<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.680> lot<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:28.920> western

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
it's mostly because a lot of western

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.550 
it's mostly because a lot of western
teens<00:00:29.550> are<00:00:29.699> more<00:00:29.880> individualized<00:00:30.660> compared

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
teens are more individualized compared

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.229 
teens are more individualized compared
to<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.769> Chinese<00:00:32.070> seems<00:00:32.279> Chinese<00:00:33.030> teams

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
to the Chinese seems Chinese teams

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.830 
to the Chinese seems Chinese teams
usually<00:00:33.739> do<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.770> lot<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.040> things<00:00:35.190> together<00:00:35.430> and

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
usually do a lot of things together and

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.590 
usually do a lot of things together and
most<00:00:36.840> of<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.079> thoughts<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:38.390> can't<00:00:39.390> say

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
most of the thoughts and I can't say

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.810 
most of the thoughts and I can't say
this<00:00:39.750> like<00:00:40.350> I'm<00:00:40.530> sure<00:00:40.770> of<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:41.010> but<00:00:41.250> from<00:00:41.670> what

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
this like I'm sure of it but from what

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.819 
this like I'm sure of it but from what
we<00:00:42.239> see<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.809> like<00:00:43.410> most<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.710> their

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
we see is that like most of their

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:44.930 
we see is that like most of their
thoughts<00:00:44.010> about<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.340> game<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.640> kind<00:00:44.879> of

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
thoughts about the game is kind of

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.190 
thoughts about the game is kind of
similar<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.510> team<00:00:45.690> they're<00:00:45.870> playing<00:00:45.899> with

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
similar to the team they're playing with

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.100 
similar to the team they're playing with
like<00:00:47.010> all<00:00:47.309> 50<00:00:47.700> g<00:00:48.090> LG<00:00:48.329> G<00:00:48.570> players<00:00:48.809> one<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.020> the

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
like all 50 g LG G players one of the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.139 
like all 50 g LG G players one of the
same<00:00:49.410> thing<00:00:49.620> well<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.430> secret<00:00:50.760> we<00:00:50.850> might<00:00:51.030> have

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
same thing well and secret we might have

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.270 
same thing well and secret we might have
like<00:00:51.329> different<00:00:51.629> ideas<00:00:52.020> between<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.440> five<00:00:53.250> of

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
like different ideas between the five of

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.689 
like different ideas between the five of
us<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:54.180> I<00:00:54.210> think<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:55.079> just<00:00:55.309> kind<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.370> makes<00:00:56.579> it

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
us so I think that just kind of makes it

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.119 
us so I think that just kind of makes it
so<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:56.850> we're<00:00:57.149> able<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.930> adapt<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.010> new

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
so that we're able to adapt to the new

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.650 
so that we're able to adapt to the new
metals<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.550> said<00:00:59.730> and<00:00:59.910> try<00:01:00.030> more<00:01:00.180> strategies

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
metals you said and try more strategies

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.689 
metals you said and try more strategies
which<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.020> kind<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.350> what<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.309> need<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.579> do

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
which is kind of what you need to do

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.700 
which is kind of what you need to do
when<00:01:02.789> there's<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.030> new<00:01:03.180> patch<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.629> think<00:01:03.840> as<00:01:04.650> you

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
when there's a new patch I think as you

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.460 
when there's a new patch I think as you
said<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.010> think<00:01:05.309> it's<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:06.020> mean<00:01:07.020> we<00:01:07.140> can't<00:01:07.170> say

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
said I think it's I mean we can't say

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.789 
said I think it's I mean we can't say
should<00:01:07.650> say<00:01:08.040> for<00:01:08.220> sure<00:01:08.250> but<00:01:08.369> i<00:01:08.610> think<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:09.030> the

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
should say for sure but i think the the

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.109 
should say for sure but i think the the
three<00:01:10.799> strongest<00:01:11.250> teams<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.700> going<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.909> be<00:01:11.970> as

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
three strongest teams is going to be as

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.929 
three strongest teams is going to be as
you<00:01:12.240> said<00:01:12.390> VG<00:01:12.689> EG<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.170> US<00:01:13.290> but<00:01:13.500> then<00:01:14.250> also<00:01:14.490> you

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
you said VG EG in US but then also you

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.080 
you said VG EG in US but then also you
have<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.710> keep<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:16.920> mind<00:01:16.950> seems<00:01:17.490> like<00:01:17.700> c9

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
have to keep in mind seems like c9

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.270 
have to keep in mind seems like c9
empire<00:01:18.840> from<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.290> Western<00:01:19.590> teams<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.950> then<00:01:20.070> a

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
empire from the Western teams and then a

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.550 
empire from the Western teams and then a
lot<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.820> Chinese<00:01:21.150> teams<00:01:21.390> what<00:01:21.990> they<00:01:22.140> might

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
lot of Chinese teams what they might

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.020 
lot of Chinese teams what they might
have<00:01:22.680> not<00:01:22.830> adapted<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.490> patch<00:01:23.640> right<00:01:23.970> now

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
have not adapted to the patch right now

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.020 
have not adapted to the patch right now
they<00:01:25.020> can<00:01:25.200> still<00:01:25.409> be<00:01:25.530> like<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.520> serious<00:01:26.909> issue

they<00:01:38.040> weren't<00:01:38.220> looking<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:38.579> good<00:01:38.729> but<00:01:39.030> then

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
they weren't looking that good but then

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.670 
they weren't looking that good but then
they<00:01:39.540> figured<00:01:39.810> out<00:01:39.930> what<00:01:40.079> they<00:01:40.200> want<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.409> do<00:01:40.560> in

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
they figured out what they want to do in

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.330 
they figured out what they want to do in
the<00:01:40.740> game<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.070> they<00:01:41.700> just<00:01:41.850> beat<00:01:42.030> everyone<00:01:42.329> so

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
the game and they just beat everyone so

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.710 
the game and they just beat everyone so
you<00:01:44.340> have<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.579> keep<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:44.939> mind<00:01:45.149> but<00:01:45.570> even

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
you have to keep that in mind but even

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.510 
you have to keep that in mind but even
though<00:01:45.869> like<00:01:46.229> on<00:01:46.380> paper<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.920> would<00:01:47.130> say<00:01:47.310> those

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
though like on paper I would say those

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.120 
though like on paper I would say those
three<00:01:47.970> teams<00:01:48.350> that<00:01:49.350> we<00:01:49.470> said<00:01:49.619> before<00:01:49.740> other

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
three teams that we said before other

three teams that we said before other
favorites<00:01:50.460> i<00:01:50.909> would<00:01:51.360> probably<00:01:52.020> say<00:01:52.200> EG<00:01:52.560> i

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
favorites i would probably say EG i

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.609 
favorites i would probably say EG i
think<00:01:53.610> what<00:01:54.540> they<00:01:54.689> might<00:01:54.869> not<00:01:55.020> be<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.439> best

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
think what they might not be the best

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.709 
think what they might not be the best
team<00:01:55.740> there<00:01:55.979> i<00:01:56.100> think<00:01:56.430> we<00:01:56.610> have<00:01:56.790> one<00:01:57.509> every

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
team there i think we have one every

like the dew strongest Chinese team
right<00:02:20.260> now<00:02:20.320> without<00:02:20.890> doubt<00:02:21.070> and<00:02:21.460> on<00:02:22.210> a<00:02:22.300> good

day<00:02:22.600> they're<00:02:22.810> going<00:02:22.900> to<00:02:22.990> be<00:02:23.080> any<00:02:23.290> Western<00:02:23.650> team

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
day they're going to be any Western team

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.960 
day they're going to be any Western team
as<00:02:23.920> well<00:02:24.210> but<00:02:25.210> of<00:02:25.480> course<00:02:26.400> like<00:02:27.400> we<00:02:27.550> believe<00:02:27.880> in

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
as well but of course like we believe in

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.960 
as well but of course like we believe in
ourselves<00:02:28.060> as<00:02:28.450> well<00:02:28.630> and<00:02:29.400> from<00:02:30.400> how<00:02:30.580> we<00:02:30.640> see<00:02:30.940> it

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
ourselves as well and from how we see it

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.070 
ourselves as well and from how we see it
I<00:02:31.240> think<00:02:31.570> we<00:02:32.170> see<00:02:32.350> EG<00:02:32.710> is<00:02:32.860> the<00:02:33.450> it's<00:02:34.450> not<00:02:34.630> better

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
I think we see EG is the it's not better

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.050 
I think we see EG is the it's not better
opponent<00:02:35.710> more<00:02:36.040> difficult<00:02:36.460> to<00:02:36.490> play<00:02:36.700> against

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
opponent more difficult to play against

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.330 
opponent more difficult to play against
and<00:02:37.960> that's<00:02:38.140> pretty<00:02:38.260> much<00:02:38.380> it<00:02:38.470> like<00:02:38.920> if<00:02:39.100> vici

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
and that's pretty much it like if vici

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.370 
and that's pretty much it like if vici
needy<00:02:39.730> play<00:02:39.940> chaturvedi<00:02:40.420> might<00:02:40.690> win<00:02:40.870> like

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
needy play chaturvedi might win like

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.500 
needy play chaturvedi might win like
really<00:02:41.560> easily<00:02:41.860> but<00:02:42.400> for<00:02:42.610> us<00:02:42.730> playing<00:02:43.090> AG<00:02:43.450> is

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
really easily but for us playing AG is

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.720 
really easily but for us playing AG is
more<00:02:43.780> difficult<00:02:43.870> i<00:02:44.320> think<00:02:44.530> i<00:02:44.740> think<00:02:45.340> in<00:02:45.580> this

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
more difficult i think i think in this

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.210 
more difficult i think i think in this
patch<00:02:45.940> a<00:02:46.510> lot<00:02:46.959> of<00:02:47.110> a<00:02:47.470> lot<00:02:47.650> of<00:02:47.709> the<00:02:47.800> games<00:02:47.980> are

which is why you see here it's like

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.400 
which is why you see here it's like

bounty<00:03:06.370> hunter<00:03:06.640> and<00:03:06.790> it's<00:03:07.780> going<00:03:07.900> to<00:03:07.959> mess

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
bounty hunter and it's going to mess

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.250 
bounty hunter and it's going to mess
with<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:08.380> Chen<00:03:08.880> because<00:03:09.880> in<00:03:10.120> theory<00:03:10.780> all<00:03:11.080> you

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
with the Chen because in theory all you

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.780 
with the Chen because in theory all you
want<00:03:11.470> to<00:03:11.530> do<00:03:11.620> is<00:03:11.800> win<00:03:11.980> your<00:03:12.130> loins<00:03:12.370> and<00:03:12.580> then

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
want to do is win your loins and then

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.330 
want to do is win your loins and then
get<00:03:13.540> like<00:03:13.690> a<00:03:13.720> mech<00:03:13.989> pushed<00:03:14.500> hours<00:03:14.830> because<00:03:15.070> you

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
get like a mech pushed hours because you

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.500 
get like a mech pushed hours because you
want<00:03:15.550> to<00:03:15.580> learn<00:03:15.730> your<00:03:15.880> face<00:03:16.030> it's<00:03:16.239> going<00:03:16.360> to<00:03:16.420> be

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
want to learn your face it's going to be

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.080 
want to learn your face it's going to be
easier<00:03:16.570> to<00:03:16.720> Tina<00:03:16.989> fight<00:03:17.200> so<00:03:17.890> I<00:03:17.920> think<00:03:18.160> pretty

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
easier to Tina fight so I think pretty

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.430 
easier to Tina fight so I think pretty
much<00:03:19.180> what<00:03:19.540> it<00:03:19.570> all<00:03:19.720> comes<00:03:19.750> down<00:03:20.019> to<00:03:20.230> is

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
much what it all comes down to is

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.930 
much what it all comes down to is
learning<00:03:20.590> right<00:03:20.890> now<00:03:20.950> so<00:03:21.400> heroes<00:03:21.730> that<00:03:21.910> are

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
learning right now so heroes that are

most<00:03:24.220> we're<00:03:24.760> still<00:03:24.970> figuring<00:03:25.420> out<00:03:25.630> where

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
most we're still figuring out where

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.050 
most we're still figuring out where
we're<00:03:26.019> going<00:03:26.170> to<00:03:26.230> go<00:03:26.260> for<00:03:26.560> forty<00:03:27.489> fi<00:03:27.700> boot<00:03:27.880> camp

we're going to go for forty fi boot camp

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.850 
we're going to go for forty fi boot camp
it's<00:03:28.840> going<00:03:29.049> to<00:03:29.080> be<00:03:29.170> after<00:03:29.470> years<00:03:29.680> of

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
it's going to be after years of

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.220 
it's going to be after years of
Frankfurt<00:03:30.250> sometime<00:03:30.700> maybe<00:03:31.420> like<00:03:31.690> a<00:03:32.019> week

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
Frankfurt sometime maybe like a week

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.220 
Frankfurt sometime maybe like a week
after<00:03:32.760> to<00:03:33.760> get<00:03:33.910> some<00:03:34.060> break<00:03:34.209> before<00:03:34.510> we<00:03:34.780> start

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
after to get some break before we start

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.820 
after to get some break before we start
fully<00:03:35.440> prepared<00:03:35.799> for<00:03:35.830> Tia<00:03:36.150> I<00:03:37.150> think<00:03:37.750> it<00:03:38.560> looks

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
fully prepared for Tia I think it looks

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.020 
fully prepared for Tia I think it looks
like<00:03:39.100> we're<00:03:39.430> probably<00:03:39.610> going<00:03:39.790> to<00:03:39.850> go<00:03:39.970> to

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
like we're probably going to go to

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.180 
like we're probably going to go to
America<00:03:40.630> to<00:03:40.780> the<00:03:41.170> west<00:03:41.320> coast<00:03:41.500> because<00:03:41.950> we

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
America to the west coast because we

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.770 
America to the west coast because we
know<00:03:42.310> a<00:03:42.340> lot<00:03:42.610> of<00:03:42.670> the<00:03:43.239> good<00:03:43.390> teams<00:03:43.600> are

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
know a lot of the good teams are

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.509 
know a lot of the good teams are
commander<00:03:44.110> and<00:03:44.290> then<00:03:45.040> I'm<00:03:45.130> going<00:03:45.250> to<00:03:45.340> be<00:03:45.459> able

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
commander and then I'm going to be able

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.520 
commander and then I'm going to be able
to<00:03:45.700> practice<00:03:46.000> with<00:03:46.150> eg<00:03:46.810> for<00:03:47.019> example<00:03:47.350> because

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
to practice with eg for example because

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.710 
to practice with eg for example because
they're<00:03:47.709> staying<00:03:47.950> as<00:03:48.010> well<00:03:48.190> and<00:03:48.370> then<00:03:49.150> I<00:03:49.420> think

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
they're staying as well and then I think

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.289 
they're staying as well and then I think
c9<00:03:50.560> is<00:03:50.680> coming<00:03:51.040> maybe<00:03:51.250> Empire<00:03:51.700> so<00:03:52.180> there's

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
c9 is coming maybe Empire so there's

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:53.580 
c9 is coming maybe Empire so there's
going<00:03:52.420> to<00:03:52.480> be<00:03:52.510> some<00:03:52.780> Western<00:03:53.110> teams<00:03:53.290> going<00:03:53.470> to

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
going to be some Western teams going to

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.979 
going to be some Western teams going to
to<00:03:54.459> the<00:03:54.549> west<00:03:54.730> coast<00:03:54.880> in<00:03:55.060> America<00:03:55.420> but<00:03:55.630> we

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 
to the west coast in America but we

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.050 
to the west coast in America but we
still<00:03:56.200> have<00:03:56.350> to<00:03:56.440> figure<00:03:56.590> out<00:03:56.799> exactly<00:03:57.190> you

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
still have to figure out exactly you

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.509 
still have to figure out exactly you
know<00:03:58.150> what<00:03:58.330> place<00:03:58.600> and<00:03:58.810> one<00:03:58.930> yeah<00:03:59.560> it's<00:04:00.310> hard

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
know what place and one yeah it's hard

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.940 
know what place and one yeah it's hard
to<00:04:00.640> say<00:04:00.790> what's<00:04:01.030> like<00:04:01.209> your<00:04:01.560> your<00:04:02.560> main<00:04:02.709> focus

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
to say what's like your your main focus

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.199 
to say what's like your your main focus
in<00:04:03.340> preparing<00:04:03.760> for<00:04:03.790> tis<00:04:05.519> you<00:04:06.519> know<00:04:06.640> it<00:04:06.790> all

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
in preparing for tis you know it all

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.690 
in preparing for tis you know it all
comes<00:04:07.420> down<00:04:07.480> to<00:04:07.600> team<00:04:08.230> to<00:04:08.350> team<00:04:08.500> for<00:04:09.400> example

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
comes down to team to team for example

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.340 
comes down to team to team for example
something<00:04:09.880> might<00:04:10.239> feel<00:04:10.780> like<00:04:10.900> they<00:04:11.049> need<00:04:11.200> to

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
something might feel like they need to

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.560 
something might feel like they need to
come<00:04:11.500> up<00:04:11.530> with<00:04:11.650> a<00:04:11.980> ton<00:04:12.400> of<00:04:12.430> strategies<00:04:12.970> 20<00:04:13.540> a

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
come up with a ton of strategies 20 a

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.560 
come up with a ton of strategies 20 a
while<00:04:14.410> for<00:04:14.769> example<00:04:15.280> the<00:04:15.790> team<00:04:16.000> like<00:04:16.120> Alliance

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
while for example the team like Alliance

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.319 
while for example the team like Alliance
the<00:04:16.660> ti3<00:04:16.900> just<00:04:17.680> wants<00:04:17.890> to<00:04:18.090> improve<00:04:19.090> what

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
the ti3 just wants to improve what

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:20.760 
the ti3 just wants to improve what
they're<00:04:19.479> doing<00:04:19.660> they<00:04:19.959> just<00:04:20.169> want<00:04:20.350> to<00:04:20.440> get

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:20.770 
they're doing they just want to get

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:22.560 
they're doing they just want to get
better<00:04:20.919> as<00:04:21.190> foot<00:04:21.400> pushing<00:04:21.729> and<00:04:22.300> that's<00:04:22.450> pretty

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
better as foot pushing and that's pretty

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:23.909 
better as foot pushing and that's pretty
much<00:04:22.660> how<00:04:22.840> they<00:04:22.960> want<00:04:23.110> AI<00:04:23.229> with<00:04:23.440> one<00:04:23.590> strategy

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
much how they want AI with one strategy

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:25.590 
much how they want AI with one strategy

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
so

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.540 
so

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.940 
just don't think it's funny anymore and
two<00:05:15.970> if<00:05:16.210> if<00:05:17.080> I<00:05:17.170> feel<00:05:17.350> like<00:05:17.440> I'm<00:05:17.620> not<00:05:17.650> good

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:17.950 
two if if I feel like I'm not good

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.540 
two if if I feel like I'm not good
enough<00:05:17.980> to<00:05:18.370> compete<00:05:19.350> so<00:05:20.350> if<00:05:20.680> either<00:05:20.860> those<00:05:21.160> two

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
enough to compete so if either those two

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.280 
enough to compete so if either those two
things<00:05:21.730> happen<00:05:22.120> I'm<00:05:22.330> going<00:05:22.480> to<00:05:22.540> stop<00:05:22.690> becoming

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.290 
things happen I'm going to stop becoming

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.500 
things happen I'm going to stop becoming
a<00:05:23.620> pro<00:05:24.220> player<00:05:24.250> but<00:05:24.910> it's<00:05:25.030> kind<00:05:25.210> of<00:05:25.240> hard<00:05:25.480> to

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
a pro player but it's kind of hard to

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.510 
a pro player but it's kind of hard to
the<00:05:25.630> same<00:05:25.750> time<00:05:26.020> because<00:05:26.290> those<00:05:26.530> things<00:05:26.740> you

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
the same time because those things you

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.810 
the same time because those things you
can't<00:05:27.730> really<00:05:27.910> predict<00:05:28.620> and<00:05:29.620> as<00:05:29.950> for<00:05:30.160> after<00:05:30.460> I

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
can't really predict and as for after I

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.720 
can't really predict and as for after I
probably<00:05:31.860> want<00:05:32.860> to<00:05:32.950> go<00:05:33.070> into<00:05:33.190> some<00:05:33.430> higher

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:33.730 
probably want to go into some higher

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.260 
probably want to go into some higher
education<00:05:34.440> but<00:05:35.440> as<00:05:36.370> a<00:05:36.430> witch<00:05:36.790> i'm<00:05:37.030> not<00:05:37.180> really

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
education but as a witch i'm not really

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.270 
education but as a witch i'm not really
sure<00:05:37.390> probably<00:05:37.750> something<00:05:38.410> in<00:05:38.500> the<00:05:38.560> science

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
sure probably something in the science

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.940 
sure probably something in the science
department<00:05:39.370> but<00:05:40.120> i'm<00:05:40.870> not<00:05:41.080> really<00:05:41.350> sure<00:05:41.440> what

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:41.950
