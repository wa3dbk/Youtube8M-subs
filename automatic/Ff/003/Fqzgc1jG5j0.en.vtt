that<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:39.230> screen<00:02:39.530> that<00:02:39.710> I've<00:02:39.830> got<00:02:40.010> is<00:02:40.190> still

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
that the screen that I've got is still

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
give me a little bit more wind

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.080 
give me a little bit more wind
deflection<00:02:48.770> or<00:02:49.040> you<00:02:49.490> know<00:02:49.580> in<00:02:49.640> high<00:02:49.820> speed

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
deflection or you know in high speed

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.560 
deflection or you know in high speed
because<00:02:51.460> that's<00:02:52.460> a<00:02:52.640> that's<00:02:52.910> a<00:02:53.060> major<00:02:53.210> cause<00:02:53.540> of

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
because that's a that's a major cause of

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.590 
because that's a that's a major cause of
fatigue<00:02:53.960> in<00:02:54.730> our<00:02:55.730> long<00:02:55.940> journeys<00:02:56.330> when<00:02:56.480> you've

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
fatigue in our long journeys when you've

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.070 
fatigue in our long journeys when you've

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
got high speed wind hitting you just

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.390 
got high speed wind hitting you just
buffers<00:03:00.590> and<00:03:00.920> you<00:03:01.190> know<00:03:01.280> hits<00:03:01.520> you<00:03:01.730> and<00:03:03.400> it

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
buffers and you know hits you and it

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.440 
buffers and you know hits you and it
just<00:03:04.550> just<00:03:04.730> makes<00:03:04.940> me<00:03:05.030> feel<00:03:05.180> a<00:03:05.210> little<00:03:05.300> bit

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
just just makes me feel a little bit

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.690 
just just makes me feel a little bit
uncomfortable<00:03:05.600> but<00:03:06.230> in<00:03:06.680> fairness<00:03:07.040> to<00:03:07.190> her<00:03:07.460> you

uncomfortable but in fairness to her you

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.760 
uncomfortable but in fairness to her you

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
know on long journeys she doesn't

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.610 
know on long journeys she doesn't
complain<00:03:10.040> doesn't<00:03:10.670> complain<00:03:10.910> at<00:03:11.150> all<00:03:11.480> I<00:03:13.030> paid

two thousand pounds for her which in

two thousand pounds for her which in
hindsight<00:03:19.970> is<00:03:20.390> probably<00:03:20.690> a<00:03:20.750> little<00:03:20.870> bit<00:03:21.050> too

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
hindsight is probably a little bit too

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.660 
hindsight is probably a little bit too
much<00:03:21.940> given<00:03:22.940> the<00:03:23.120> mileage<00:03:23.510> and<00:03:23.720> given<00:03:24.670> the

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.290 
grand is is probably a little bit too
much<00:03:40.430> but<00:03:41.830> you<00:03:42.830> know<00:03:42.890> if<00:03:43.220> something<00:03:43.880> is<00:03:44.030> worth

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
much but you know if something is worth

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.320 
much but you know if something is worth
paying<00:03:45.220> high<00:03:46.220> high<00:03:46.580> amounts<00:03:46.850> of<00:03:46.970> money<00:03:47.090> for

paying high high amounts of money for

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.150 
paying high high amounts of money for
then<00:03:49.090> you<00:03:50.090> know<00:03:50.180> I<00:03:50.209> don't<00:03:50.390> I<00:03:50.840> don't<00:03:50.989> see<00:03:51.470> the

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
then you know I don't I don't see the

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.500 
then you know I don't I don't see the
problem<00:03:52.310> as<00:03:52.610> long<00:03:52.640> as<00:03:52.910> there's<00:03:53.120> justification

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
problem as long as there's justification

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.310 
problem as long as there's justification
for<00:03:54.080> it<00:03:54.260> and<00:03:55.270> you<00:03:56.270> know<00:03:56.390> the<00:03:56.510> bike<00:03:56.720> itself<00:03:57.080> is

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
for it and you know the bike itself is

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.760 
for it and you know the bike itself is
definitely<00:03:57.830> that<00:03:58.040> so<00:03:59.140> I'm<00:04:00.140> very<00:04:00.320> pleased<00:04:00.620> with

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
definitely that so I'm very pleased with

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:05.320 
definitely that so I'm very pleased with
her<00:04:00.920> and<00:04:01.100> I<00:04:02.950> have<00:04:03.950> been<00:04:04.160> -<00:04:04.459> you<00:04:04.910> know<00:04:05.000> -

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
her and I have been - you know -

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.370 
her and I have been - you know -
inferring<00:04:05.930> the<00:04:06.110> idea<00:04:06.530> of<00:04:06.709> changing<00:04:07.700> her<00:04:08.380> next

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
inferring the idea of changing her next

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.479 
inferring the idea of changing her next
year<00:04:09.440> when<00:04:09.890> my<00:04:10.010> restriction<00:04:10.459> ends<00:04:11.830> -<00:04:12.830> maybe<00:04:13.370> a

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
year when my restriction ends - maybe a

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.759 
year when my restriction ends - maybe a
supermoto<00:04:13.989> probably<00:04:15.040> you<00:04:16.040> know<00:04:16.130> DRS<00:04:16.519> Ned<00:04:16.700> 400

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
supermoto probably you know DRS Ned 400

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.880 
supermoto probably you know DRS Ned 400
very<00:04:18.769> very<00:04:18.980> interested<00:04:19.340> in<00:04:19.400> one<00:04:19.549> of<00:04:19.640> those<00:04:20.890> but

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
very very interested in one of those but

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:23.830 
very very interested in one of those but
we'll<00:04:22.430> see<00:04:22.669> we'll<00:04:23.210> see<00:04:23.240> we<00:04:23.450> definitely<00:04:23.750> get

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
we'll see we'll see we definitely get

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.029 
we'll see we'll see we definitely get
the<00:04:23.900> restriction<00:04:24.289> either<00:04:24.410> way<00:04:24.560> I've<00:04:24.680> only<00:04:24.800> got

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:25.039 
the restriction either way I've only got

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:28.249 
the restriction either way I've only got
till<00:04:25.880> July

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:28.259 
till July

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:30.620 
till July
and<00:04:28.650> then<00:04:28.860> my<00:04:29.009> insurance<00:04:29.699> on<00:04:29.910> this<00:04:30.210> one<00:04:30.389> runs

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
and then my insurance on this one runs

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.159 
and then my insurance on this one runs
out<00:04:30.810> in<00:04:31.319> August<00:04:32.060> so<00:04:33.060> we'll<00:04:33.389> we'll<00:04:33.810> see<00:04:34.050> what

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
out in August so we'll we'll see what

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:37.490 
out in August so we'll we'll see what

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
know 70 very very happily indeed so I

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.749 
know 70 very very happily indeed so I
suppose<00:05:38.550> it's<00:05:38.820> just<00:05:38.880> a<00:05:39.060> case<00:05:39.240> of<00:05:40.639> revving<00:05:41.639> the

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:41.759 
suppose it's just a case of revving the

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:46.040 
suppose it's just a case of revving the
bollocks<00:05:42.090> off<00:05:42.240> of<00:05:42.389> it<00:05:42.509> really<00:05:44.960> take<00:05:45.960> the

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
bollocks off of it really take the

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.240 
bollocks off of it really take the
microphone<00:05:46.380> out<00:05:46.650> for<00:05:46.830> you<00:05:46.919> so<00:05:47.009> you<00:05:47.070> got<00:05:47.219> a

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
microphone out for you so you got a

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.419 
microphone out for you so you got a
better<00:05:47.610> idea<00:05:47.759> of<00:05:47.969> how<00:05:48.090> she<00:05:48.150> sounds
