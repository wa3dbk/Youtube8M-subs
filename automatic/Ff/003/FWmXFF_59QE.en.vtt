00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:36.780
 intersection of that piola and the tracks 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.670
 Here you can find meters

 helicopter to have aerial images 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.090
 of this impressive tragedy and there it is 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:09.750
 see the train and on the tracks 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:13.040
 the firefighters that are working is 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:17.220
 the area completely fenced and in the distance 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.510
 all the deployment of police officers and 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.100
 nurses who are trying to 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.570
 help the victims that still 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.570
 they are in training 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.550
 ah 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.110
 a day after the trouble they are 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.969
 working if you know if they are injured 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.039
 still without the formation of less there is no 

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:40.909
 more injured how many trips have been made 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:44.859
 you since that 2 arrived 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.859
 with how many injured doing 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.840
 also what they first took with 

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:53.689
 other phones with multiple injuries to 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.090
 as we approach the place where 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:59.240
 it's just the impact of these two 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.700
 trains we see more more ambulances lend 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.459
 attention to get an idea of the 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.709
 magnitude of the operative 

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:10.250
 we are walking we are about 100 

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:13.099
 meters of the crash and this street that runs 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.920
 parallel to the tracks is totally 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:18.200
 crowded ambulances ambulances 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.900
 they came from all over the 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.870
 conurbation 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.049
 the municipalities that are closest to 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.640
 here and also came up from the 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:32.299
 city ​​with the air is present 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:35.049
 staff of the same who is working 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:35.049
 also in the area 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.049
 now if we are at the exact point 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:45.689
 where the accident occurred is this 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:49.170
 one of the formations and there what they see 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:53.189
 in images is the place of impact 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:56.370
 we see a lot of police personnel from 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:59.280
 gendarmerie fire brigade and of course 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.280
 doctors and there in the distance you can see 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.830
 how was it 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:07.439
 practically made an accordion the train 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:12.659
 or the training that has two floors and the 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:16.049
 place of impact is impressive 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:19.920
 blow that these two trains were given and 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:23.370
 as they were, it 's like it's a 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.980
 accordion is the whole train the 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:29.599
 Most of the wagons are like yours 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.599
 one on top of the other 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:38.180
 Now we're just a few meters from 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:42.590
 place of the collision what we can see 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:46.130
 is a lot iron twisted the image of 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:49.070
 one train mounted on another and what 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:54.710
 We previously mentioned this species 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:57.740
 of accordion that was formed by all 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:02.870
 wagons that were 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:05.650
 touching one behind the other and we see 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:10.220
 a lot of police personnel that is 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:13.700
 working there is federal police 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:17.359
 above the formation 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:20.810
 they enter firefighters to one 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:23.300
 of the wagons is a lot of people 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.639
 very much the attention that is lived in 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.830
 this area instead of the fact but that already 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:30.080
 is also central and there I will look in 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:33.530
 the screen and I look for all that 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:36.020
 we move and get ready Navarre and 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:39.039
 avenue rivadavia meters from where 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.210
 the collision happened a tent was installed 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:43.660
 that you have now in the image 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:47.380
 a tent to attend 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:51.790
