makers bench underneath as well but like

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:40.789 
makers bench underneath as well but like
I<00:03:38.949> said<00:03:39.010> you<00:03:39.220> can't<00:03:39.370> place<00:03:39.549> anything<00:03:39.790> above<00:03:40.150> it

I said you can't place anything above it

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.210 
I said you can't place anything above it
other<00:03:41.799> than<00:03:42.760> water<00:03:43.540> or<00:03:43.870> lava<00:03:44.199> water<00:03:44.829> you<00:03:45.040> can

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
other than water or lava water you can

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.789 
other than water or lava water you can
still<00:03:45.430> see<00:03:45.579> the<00:03:45.609> chest<00:03:45.970> which<00:03:46.900> isn't<00:03:47.260> quite<00:03:47.500> as

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.430 
still see the chest which isn't quite as
cool<00:03:48.040> but<00:03:48.489> I<00:03:48.790> guess<00:03:49.389> if<00:03:49.569> you<00:03:49.720> want<00:03:50.229> to<00:03:50.319> put

signs and have a waterfall in front of
your<00:03:52.930> chest<00:03:53.199> that's<00:03:53.530> cool<00:03:53.799> too<00:03:54.120> so<00:03:55.120> and<00:03:56.109> then

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
your chest that's cool too so and then

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.129 
your chest that's cool too so and then
you<00:03:57.040> need<00:03:57.310> to<00:03:57.849> make<00:03:58.659> an<00:03:58.810> opening<00:03:59.290> and<00:04:01.139> place

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:02.139 
you need to make an opening and place

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:04.199 
you need to make an opening and place
half<00:04:02.799> blocks<00:04:03.129> right<00:04:03.310> here<00:04:03.519> so<00:04:03.729> that<00:04:03.909> when<00:04:04.090> the

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
half blocks right here so that when the

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.719 
half blocks right here so that when the
lava<00:04:04.419> flows<00:04:04.750> over<00:04:05.019> it<00:04:05.859> gets<00:04:06.069> stopped<00:04:06.400> by<00:04:06.669> the

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:06.729 
lava flows over it gets stopped by the

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:08.849 
lava flows over it gets stopped by the
half<00:04:06.940> blocks<00:04:07.209> otherwise<00:04:08.049> you're<00:04:08.349> kind<00:04:08.799> of

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859 
half blocks otherwise you're kind of

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:11.490 
half blocks otherwise you're kind of
screwed<00:04:09.150> and<00:04:10.150> then<00:04:10.750> you<00:04:10.900> just<00:04:11.079> place<00:04:11.349> your

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
screwed and then you just place your

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.110 
screwed and then you just place your
lava<00:04:11.680> top

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.670 

and<00:04:15.239> then<00:04:15.900> it<00:04:16.019> flows<00:04:16.320> over<00:04:16.560> and<00:04:18.290> the<00:04:19.290> wallet

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
and then it flows over and the wallet

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.909 
and then it flows over and the wallet
you<00:04:20.100> can<00:04:20.400> cover<00:04:21.090> up<00:04:21.269> the<00:04:21.570> flow<00:04:22.470> right<00:04:22.710> there

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
you can cover up the flow right there

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.250 
you can cover up the flow right there
and<00:04:23.100> then<00:04:23.190> you've<00:04:23.310> got<00:04:23.460> a<00:04:23.490> little<00:04:23.790> I<00:04:24.260> guess
