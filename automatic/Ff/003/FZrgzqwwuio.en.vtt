00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.060 
yeah as you can see it's only going up
to<00:01:45.810> level<00:01:45.930> 30<00:01:46.200> it's<00:01:46.470> not<00:01:46.619> going<00:01:46.770> anything

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
to level 30 it's not going anything

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.490 
to level 30 it's not going anything
higher<00:01:47.540> which<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:48.659> one<00:01:48.810> of<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.930> updates<00:01:49.320> for

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
higher which is one of the updates for

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.560 
higher which is one of the updates for
1.3<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.159> with<00:01:50.369> what<00:01:50.759> these<00:01:50.880> bookshelves<00:01:51.119> in

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
1.3 and with what these bookshelves in

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.060 
1.3 and with what these bookshelves in
one<00:01:51.750> point<00:01:51.990> two<00:01:52.079> point<00:01:52.259> five<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.740> would<00:01:52.920> go

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
one point two point five it would go

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.700 
one point two point five it would go
higher<00:01:53.310> than<00:01:53.340> 30<00:01:53.880> so<00:01:54.509> uh<00:01:54.540> I<00:01:54.960> guess<00:01:55.380> there's

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
higher than 30 so uh I guess there's

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.109 
higher than 30 so uh I guess there's
your<00:01:55.829> proof<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.490> yeah<00:01:56.610> just<00:01:56.790> go<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:56.939> mod
