00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.940
 hi friends today for dessert let's do 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:18.180
 a great panacotta of strawberries and 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.750
 chocolate I tell you the ingredients here 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:25.259
 we have half a kilo of strawberries 200 grams 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.830
 of cream or milk cream as you 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:33.330
 llama in South America 150 grams of 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:36.600
 black chocolate 100 grams of sugar and 6 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:40.230
 gelatin leaves is from these sheets of 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.729
 gelatin 6 we are going to use with these 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.909
 ingredients we are going to make our 

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:47.449
 great panacotta of strawberries and 

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:47.449
 chocolate 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.940
 first of all we are going to crush the 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.420
 strawberries that as you can see here we already have them 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.390
 cut and here we have put in water 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.370
 four of the six sheets of gelatin 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.360
 as you can see and we have them soft in water 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.460
 cool 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:10.290
 we have put on and you see and we have them 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.750
 ready to take this is the first step 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.870
 here we have the strawberries that we have 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.090
 well crushed and we have cast them then 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.830
 to avoid some piece that can be 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.220
 get fatter 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.130
 now let's add the sugar we have already 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.590
 put to the fire and we are going to add the 4 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.600
 gelatin sheets that we already have 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.820
 soft 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.820
 we drain them from the water 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.630
 we put them in the but -ha now let's 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.880
 mix this will hopefully upload a 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.850
 little fire we do not want it to boil or 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.260
 much less just to warm up 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.420
 and that the gelatin dissolves 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.990
 as soon as it's warmed up and we see that 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:59.149
 the gelatin has dissolved 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.149
 we will put the mixture in the mold 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.910
 here as you see we are going to use a mold of 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.220
 silicone 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.200
 and we have thrown all the mixture of 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.410
 crushed strawberries and now one step 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.570
 important is to put in the refrigerator 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.270
 about two hours we will have to calculate 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.370
 because this has to curdle more or less 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.090
 minimum about two hours 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.090
 we are going to 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:35.500
 we have put the cream to heat now 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.500
 let's add the chocolate 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.050
 and two sheets of gelatine 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.590
 let's drain well 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:50.569
 in the water and we are going to add the fire 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.930
 we already have it on 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:56.269
 very strong fire we will leave a 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.609
 soft fire because it has to melt 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.560
 very good all the chocolate and both 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:03.830
 gelatin sheets 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.470
 we will slowly stirring until 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.920
 everything is dissolved and everything is 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.920
 report 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.580
 we already have everything well fused and now 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.860
 we will remove it from the fire and we will 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.520
 let it temper a little before 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.520
 cast the world 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.859
 we have already put the chocolate on the 

00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:32.680
 another mix of strawberries that had already 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:34.599
 perfectly set and now comes another 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.489
 important step that is to leave it again 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.799
 in the cold but this time we're going to 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:41.560
 leave more time a minimum of 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:43.840
 four hours or the best how are we going to 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.359
 do us leaving all night in 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.790
 the refrigerator overnight and tomorrow 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:50.939
 we have unmold and we will see how 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.939
 comes out 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:59.620
 good friends and here we have our 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:02.819
 panna cotta of strawberries and chocolate does not 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.080
 you will say that it does not look fabulous 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:07.450
 I hope you liked it and that the 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.150
 do at home because it really is 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:13.489
 delicious 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.489
 and until the next video goodbye
