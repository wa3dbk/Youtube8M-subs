modifying various things we put this

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.710 
modifying various things we put this
other<00:01:44.340> set<00:01:44.549> of<00:01:44.579> carbs<00:01:44.909> on<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.329> then<00:01:45.450> we<00:01:45.540> ended

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
other set of carbs on and then we ended

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.050 
other set of carbs on and then we ended
up<00:01:45.840> putting<00:01:46.049> on<00:01:46.229> this<00:01:46.409> oil<00:01:46.649> cooler<00:01:47.070> which

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
up putting on this oil cooler which

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.359 
up putting on this oil cooler which
helps<00:01:48.299> out<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.450> lot<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.930> definitely<00:01:49.220> cools<00:01:50.220> the

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
helps out a lot it definitely cools the

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.210 
helps out a lot it definitely cools the
bike<00:01:50.520> down<00:01:50.729> nicely<00:01:51.649> there's<00:01:52.649> all<00:01:52.770> kinds<00:01:53.100> of

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
bike down nicely there's all kinds of

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.359 
bike down nicely there's all kinds of
other<00:01:53.700> things<00:01:53.880> we<00:01:54.329> did<00:01:54.479> here<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:55.290> vapor<00:01:56.009> gage

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
other things we did here a vapor gage

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.830 
other things we did here a vapor gage
the<00:01:57.090> trail<00:01:57.479> tech<00:01:57.659> vapor<00:01:57.899> gage<00:01:59.540> we<00:02:00.540> wanted<00:02:00.780> the

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
the trail tech vapor gage we wanted the

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.660 
the trail tech vapor gage we wanted the
wheels<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.200> be<00:02:01.290> lighter<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:01.619> obviously<00:02:02.310> we<00:02:02.460> did

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
wheels to be lighter so obviously we did

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.929 
wheels to be lighter so obviously we did
the<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.270> old<00:02:03.390> Sun<00:02:03.920> aluminum<00:02:04.920> rims<00:02:05.159> stainless

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
basically you know rebuilt upgraded

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.860 
basically you know rebuilt upgraded
wheel<00:02:18.510> package<00:02:18.749> front<00:02:19.349> and<00:02:19.469> rear<00:02:20.150> and<00:02:21.150> then<00:02:21.719> we

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
wheel package front and rear and then we

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.229 
wheel package front and rear and then we
kept<00:02:22.739> with<00:02:22.889> the<00:02:22.920> stock<00:02:23.249> oil<00:02:23.459> tank<00:02:23.849> but<00:02:24.150> we

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
kept with the stock oil tank but we

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.020 
kept with the stock oil tank but we
moved<00:02:24.420> it<00:02:24.659> backward<00:02:25.109> and<00:02:26.069> set<00:02:26.489> more<00:02:26.760> into<00:02:26.939> the

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
moved it backward and set more into the

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.429 
moved it backward and set more into the
frame<00:02:27.299> so<00:02:27.569> you<00:02:27.719> wouldn't<00:02:27.930> be<00:02:27.989> touching<00:02:28.319> your

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
you know we went through and polished

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.440 
you know we went through and polished
all<00:02:44.879> the<00:02:44.969> case<00:02:45.209> covers<00:02:45.829> sourced<00:02:46.829> various<00:02:47.459> you

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
all the case covers sourced various you

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.520 
all the case covers sourced various you
know<00:02:48.480> new<00:02:49.469> parts<00:02:49.909> tappets<00:02:50.909> and<00:02:51.180> car<00:02:51.780> boots<00:02:52.109> and

know new parts tappets and car boots and

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.530 
know new parts tappets and car boots and
all<00:02:52.769> the<00:02:53.639> motor<00:02:53.819> parts<00:02:54.150> are<00:02:54.239> pretty<00:02:54.419> much

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
all the motor parts are pretty much

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.110 
all the motor parts are pretty much
sourced<00:02:54.900> by<00:02:55.019> him<00:02:55.519> you<00:02:56.519> know<00:02:56.609> he<00:02:56.699> went<00:02:56.849> into<00:02:57.000> the

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
sourced by him you know he went into the

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.740 
sourced by him you know he went into the
transmission<00:02:57.569> crosscut<00:02:58.379> gears<00:02:59.239> and<00:03:00.239> then<00:03:00.510> you

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
transmission crosscut gears and then you

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.939 
transmission crosscut gears and then you
know<00:03:00.840> even<00:03:01.109> went<00:03:01.290> as<00:03:01.409> far<00:03:01.439> as<00:03:01.799> designing<00:03:02.459> a

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:03.949 
know even went as far as designing a

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:06.770 
know even went as far as designing a
motor<00:03:04.949> mount<00:03:05.159> package<00:03:05.430> so<00:03:06.299> I<00:03:06.329> think<00:03:06.629> these<00:03:06.719> are

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
motor mount package so I think these are

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.509 
motor mount package so I think these are
like<00:03:07.049> almost<00:03:07.230> a<00:03:07.439> hundred<00:03:07.709> times<00:03:07.919> stronger

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
like almost a hundred times stronger

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.360 
like almost a hundred times stronger
than<00:03:08.699> the<00:03:08.969> steel<00:03:09.299> stock<00:03:10.099> package<00:03:11.099> and<00:03:11.250> these

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
than the steel stock package and these

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.159 
than the steel stock package and these
are<00:03:11.519> actually<00:03:11.909> I<00:03:11.939> think<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.449> second<00:03:12.900> version

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:13.169 
are actually I think the second version

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:15.319 
are actually I think the second version
first<00:03:13.709> version<00:03:14.040> is<00:03:14.159> pretty<00:03:14.370> rough<00:03:14.549> this<00:03:15.239> is

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
first version is pretty rough this is

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.420 
first version is pretty rough this is
the<00:03:15.480> second<00:03:15.900> version<00:03:16.049> um<00:03:16.469> and<00:03:17.099> we're<00:03:17.310> thinking

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
the second version um and we're thinking

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.449 
the second version um and we're thinking
about<00:03:17.639> getting<00:03:18.269> these<00:03:18.509> into<00:03:18.689> production<00:03:19.049> and

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
about getting these into production and

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.300 
about getting these into production and
you<00:03:20.459> know<00:03:20.549> making<00:03:21.120> multiples<00:03:21.659> of<00:03:21.810> them<00:03:22.310> you

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
you know making multiples of them you

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.530 
you know making multiples of them you
know<00:03:23.400> what<00:03:23.519> the<00:03:23.609> braking<00:03:24.000> is<00:03:24.120> pretty<00:03:24.359> much

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
know what the braking is pretty much

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.170 
know what the braking is pretty much
stock<00:03:24.959> but<00:03:25.439> uh<00:03:25.489> you<00:03:26.489> know<00:03:26.579> updated<00:03:27.030> master

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
stock but uh you know updated master

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.240 
stock but uh you know updated master
cylinder<00:03:27.810> I<00:03:28.019> believe<00:03:28.680> that's<00:03:28.799> off<00:03:29.009> like<00:03:29.220> a

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
cylinder I believe that's off like a

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.530 
cylinder I believe that's off like a
jigs<00:03:29.669> or<00:03:29.819> CBR<00:03:30.689> I<00:03:30.930> can't<00:03:31.199> remember<00:03:31.379> exactly

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
jigs or CBR I can't remember exactly

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.099 
jigs or CBR I can't remember exactly
work<00:03:33.540> shocks<00:03:33.959> just<00:03:34.669> like<00:03:35.669> the<00:03:35.849> thorne<00:03:36.120> highly

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
work shocks just like the thorne highly

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:39.890 
work shocks just like the thorne highly
adjustable<00:03:37.970> great<00:03:38.970> suspension<00:03:39.299> package<00:03:39.599> you

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
adjustable great suspension package you

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.149 
adjustable great suspension package you
could<00:03:39.989> do<00:03:40.169> you<00:03:40.349> can<00:03:40.470> adjust<00:03:40.739> it<00:03:40.859> pretty<00:03:41.009> much

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:41.159 
could do you can adjust it pretty much

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:43.729 
could do you can adjust it pretty much
however<00:03:41.400> for<00:03:42.030> whatever<00:03:42.209> riding<00:03:42.750> and<00:03:43.439> you<00:03:43.470> said
