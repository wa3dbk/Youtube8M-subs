00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:12.570
 we now look at our losing test is the 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:15.690
 samsung galaxy note 10.1 for software 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.470
 which accompanies the version here 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.560
 we are 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:23.910
 is android option 4.1.1 or is it 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:27.029
 money in me and to which samsung 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.300
 added its touch touch interface 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.430
 as you can see here the lock allow 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.670
 treadmill four applications that can 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.879
 pull directly when you slide your finger 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.679
 to top in these applications being that 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.620
 to simply unlock the tablet 

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:46.829
 just do it like this 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.280
 here we have one of the main awards 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.589
 can easily customize with 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.870
 widgets and application shortcuts for this 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:57.809
 the traditional Andrade technician is enough 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:02.370
 load extension and choose the 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:06.380
 option we want to be and applications 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:09.990
 test from the top being that it is 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.030
 divided between pepsi and widgets what 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.890
 we have a list of hits that we can 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.660
 add to the main screens of the 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.090
 android 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:23.490
 up here we have six children you 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.500
 have seen this option 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.150
 we have the applications that describe the 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.060
 unless they were not included as 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.310
 this will be when your purchase is 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.350
 here we also have a menu of options 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.630
 that allows us to go directly to your 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:41.220
 history search and install applications 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:44.160
 directly from here 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.740
 is down here almost permanently 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.780
 only visible sessions when 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.910
 example we are overwhelmed with the video 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.670
 per minute says consider the functions 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.390
 the system, such as going back to 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.840
 back 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.420
 ro ac considers the link between the 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.320
 applications that the feeling used 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:07.470
 because in this case this option that there 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.500
 that shocks me from the tablet 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.689
 here is a gorge we have access too 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.890
 there is a list of frequent applications 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:17.450
 that we can penalize 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.700
 and that gives us a way because so 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.209
 allowing me as a citizen to have 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.340
 directly access to 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.010
 the applications we use most here 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.590
 More than we are here, said Potter, then 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.959
 it's always system notifications 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.660
 wanting to have access to these 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.910
 notifications as well as settings 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.090
 fast we can define as per 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:44.810
 example to enable or disable a chery 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:48.590
 also the energy-saving mode 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:51.320
 mobile data with wifi gps or dots 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.870
 are in practice is because here has 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.300
 access to functions that really 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.290
 we use more often brings other 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.910
 Definitions 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:05.239
 just go here and we have all the 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.800
 settings of the tablet you've 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.220
 three legs example 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:13.400
 the accounts we have set up so 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:16.700
 like the whole array of options that 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:21.350
 we can configure on our tablet as 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:24.200
 can see the interface is very fluid and 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.480
 here is one more thing that does not 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.190
 is small in the background because it is also a 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.070
 news that samsung included in the 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:36.980
 galaxy note tab 10.1 which is the last 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:38.750
 that we allow you to 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.940
 applications actually working 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.430
 same time is not only alter 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.560
 between them as is customary in 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.440
 mobile operating systems 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.350
 coming here this application is 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:56.870
 here on the left and how 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:59.959
 example we can release a video that is 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.299
 is an employee as we continue to read 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.049
 for example in this case and the revolution 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:07.130
 digital 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:11.260
 the video works at the same time the team 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.260
 for example of primacy 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.550
 the whole more videos of the event itself 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:21.200
 degrees here because in brazil it stayed 

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:25.240
 any child who is using follow up 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.240
 Or can we have facebook here? 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:31.490
 care also very different to have 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:34.190
 access when you did not come in 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:38.540
 coffee in the case of the videos is very much 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:42.200
 practical and all this as you can see from 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:45.580
 very smoothly and without any 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:48.680
 type of choke 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:51.040
 with regard to the production system and 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.720
 interface for now is everything 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:56.750
 we will also analyze other we have 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.760
 status as internet and multimedia games 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.730
 the same with the camera in the 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:04.930
 other videos of this test is remake of 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.930
 January on our website 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.600
 day and until now
