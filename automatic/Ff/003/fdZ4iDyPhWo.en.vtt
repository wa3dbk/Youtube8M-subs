00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
been turning for a lot longer than I

lot of toys that I don't have in my shop
so<00:00:11.340> I<00:00:11.370> figured<00:00:11.790> I'd<00:00:11.910> give<00:00:12.450> him<00:00:12.540> a<00:00:12.660> chance<00:00:12.900> at

so I figured I'd give him a chance at
stardom<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.670> let<00:00:15.000> him<00:00:15.150> show<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.420> few<00:00:15.719> of<00:00:15.870> his

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
stardom and let him show a few of his

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.730 
stardom and let him show a few of his
sharpener<00:00:16.920> techniques<00:00:18.020> good<00:00:19.020> show<00:00:19.260> good<00:00:19.680> show

I've been using it ever since it came
out<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.149> don't<00:00:33.420> think<00:00:33.600> anybody's<00:00:34.140> improved<00:00:34.530> on

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.100 

and<00:00:45.180> that's<00:00:45.660> about<00:00:45.900> how<00:00:46.260> long<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:47.240> pass<00:00:48.240> back

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
and that's about how long a pass back

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.500 
and that's about how long a pass back
and<00:00:49.530> I'm<00:00:49.770> done<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.490> I'm<00:00:50.610> ready<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:51.030> go<00:00:51.150> back<00:00:51.300> to

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:55.560 
the lake again I'm a woodturner not a

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.120 
the lake again I'm a woodturner not a
sharpener<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.810> what<00:00:57.810> we'll<00:00:57.990> do<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.530> we<00:00:58.800> start

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.130 
sharpener so what we'll do is we start

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.329 
sharpener so what we'll do is we start
by<00:00:59.400> setting<00:00:59.730> the<00:01:00.060> extension<00:01:00.660> beyond<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.290> tool

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:10.850 

1.75<00:01:05.339> inches<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.180> turn<00:01:07.110> this<00:01:07.380> on<00:01:07.940> and<00:01:09.590> I'll<00:01:10.590> show

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
1.75 inches I turn this on and I'll show

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.710 
1.75 inches I turn this on and I'll show
you<00:01:10.920> how<00:01:11.160> long<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.520> takes<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.880> put<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.120> tool<00:01:12.390> back

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
you how long it takes to put a tool back

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:26.700 
you how long it takes to put a tool back
right

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.770 

I'm<00:01:27.010> now<00:01:27.250> going<00:01:27.490> to<00:01:27.580> grind<00:01:27.790> the<00:01:27.970> ball<00:01:28.210> balance

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
I'm now going to grind the ball balance

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.270 
I'm now going to grind the ball balance
using<00:01:29.020> the<00:01:29.500> very<00:01:29.890> right<00:01:30.280> one<00:01:31.140> from<00:01:32.140> one<00:01:32.710> way<00:01:32.920> I

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
using the very right one from one way I

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.210 
using the very right one from one way I
start<00:01:33.880> by<00:01:34.120> setting<00:01:34.450> a<00:01:35.910> an<00:01:36.910> inch<00:01:37.420> and<00:01:37.660> a<00:01:37.720> quarter

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
start by setting a an inch and a quarter

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.720 
start by setting a an inch and a quarter
beyond<00:01:39.970> the<00:01:40.360> tool<00:01:40.720> then<00:01:41.380> I<00:01:41.560> move<00:01:41.830> the<00:01:42.750> bar<00:01:43.750> out

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:44.730 
beyond the tool then I move the bar out

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.010 
beyond the tool then I move the bar out
to<00:01:45.730> the<00:01:45.910> 60<00:01:46.420> degree<00:01:46.450> mark

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:02:03.560 

and<00:01:49.259> they<00:01:49.350> were<00:01:49.500> ready<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.740> cry

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.130 

and<00:02:04.570> that<00:02:04.780> tool<00:02:05.820> needed<00:02:06.820> sharpening<00:02:07.600> and<00:02:07.900> it

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
and that tool needed sharpening and it

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.320 
and that tool needed sharpening and it
is<00:02:08.290> now<00:02:08.530> sharp<00:02:08.890> and<00:02:09.250> that's<00:02:09.400> all<00:02:09.610> it<00:02:09.790> takes<00:02:10.030> is

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
is now sharp and that's all it takes is

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.990 
is now sharp and that's all it takes is
a<00:02:10.360> couple<00:02:10.840> of<00:02:10.960> rounds<00:02:11.110> back<00:02:11.590> and<00:02:11.830> forth<00:02:12.070> and<00:02:12.850> we

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
a couple of rounds back and forth and we

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.490 
a couple of rounds back and forth and we
have<00:02:13.150> a<00:02:13.180> tool<00:02:13.450> with<00:02:13.660> sharp<00:02:13.990> when<00:02:14.200> I<00:02:14.290> can<00:02:14.410> go

I'm not a sharpener I'm a woodturner
I'll<00:02:18.580> now<00:02:18.880> convert<00:02:19.330> this<00:02:19.480> grinder<00:02:20.020> from<00:02:20.170> 45

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
I'll now convert this grinder from 45

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.740 
I'll now convert this grinder from 45
degrees<00:02:21.310> spindle<00:02:21.880> guards<00:02:22.270> to<00:02:22.600> a<00:02:23.310> 60-degree

that's for 60-degree bowl gouge to do
the<00:02:56.110> spindle<00:02:56.620> gouge<00:02:56.800> I<00:02:57.160> take<00:02:57.430> it<00:02:57.610> out<00:02:57.760> and<00:02:57.940> go

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
the spindle gouge I take it out and go

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.670 
the spindle gouge I take it out and go
on<00:02:58.360> in<00:03:00.270> the<00:03:01.270> same<00:03:01.690> amount<00:03:02.110> of<00:03:02.260> extension

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
on in the same amount of extension

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:20.309 
on in the same amount of extension
beyond<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.370> tool

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.250 

now<00:03:21.319> we<00:03:21.380> have<00:03:21.680> a<00:03:21.709> spindle<00:03:22.580> gouge<00:03:22.900> and<00:03:23.900> I<00:03:24.020> like

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
now we have a spindle gouge and I like

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.400 
now we have a spindle gouge and I like
to<00:03:24.440> describe<00:03:24.620> that<00:03:25.160> scary<00:03:25.760> sharp<00:03:26.180> so<00:03:27.020> you<00:03:27.110> see

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
to describe that scary sharp so you see

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.740 
to describe that scary sharp so you see
I<00:03:27.440> use<00:03:27.890> the<00:03:28.190> same<00:03:30.640> extension<00:03:31.640> beyond<00:03:32.240> the<00:03:32.510> tool

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
I use the same extension beyond the tool

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.660 
I use the same extension beyond the tool
and<00:03:33.850> have<00:03:34.850> stops<00:03:35.480> that<00:03:36.200> caused<00:03:36.500> me<00:03:36.800> to<00:03:36.830> have<00:03:36.980> to

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
and have stops that caused me to have to

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.440 
and have stops that caused me to have to
use<00:03:37.940> things<00:03:38.330> and<00:03:38.750> make<00:03:38.930> them<00:03:39.170> repeatable

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
use things and make them repeatable

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.710 
use things and make them repeatable
reason<00:03:41.450> it<00:03:41.630> has<00:03:41.900> to<00:03:42.230> be<00:03:42.459> repeatable<00:03:43.459> is<00:03:43.850> that

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
reason it has to be repeatable is that

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.220 
reason it has to be repeatable is that
tool<00:03:45.050> steel<00:03:45.500> is<00:03:45.770> expensive<00:03:46.520> and<00:03:46.940> if<00:03:47.690> you<00:03:47.840> fall

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
tool steel is expensive and if you fall

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.270 
tool steel is expensive and if you fall
right<00:03:48.980> back<00:03:49.010> into<00:03:49.580> the<00:03:49.880> same<00:03:50.150> bevel<00:03:50.900> each<00:03:51.739> time

right back into the same bevel each time

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:59.089 
right back into the same bevel each time
you're<00:03:53.239> using<00:03:53.269> up<00:03:53.930> less<00:03:54.230> tool<00:03:54.709> steel

I'm<00:03:59.909> now<00:04:00.209> going<00:04:00.540> to<00:04:00.829> grind<00:04:01.829> a<00:04:02.959> spindle

I'll<00:05:37.560> show<00:05:38.069> you<00:05:38.129> how<00:05:38.370> I<00:05:38.400> set<00:05:38.849> the<00:05:39.539> bevel<00:05:39.900> angles

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:40.289 
I'll show you how I set the bevel angles

that's<00:06:04.889> really<00:06:05.219> good<00:06:05.610> about<00:06:05.639> that<00:06:06.210> is<00:06:06.479> that<00:06:07.189> it

00:06:08.179 --> 00:06:08.189 
that's really good about that is that it

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:12.730 
that's really good about that is that it
works

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:25.650 
way that would work is I would go back

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:34.010 
way that would work is I would go back
down<00:06:26.039> again<00:06:32.000> I'll<00:06:33.000> have<00:06:33.300> to<00:06:33.479> back<00:06:33.719> out<00:06:33.960> a

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020 
down again I'll have to back out a

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:43.430 
down again I'll have to back out a
little<00:06:34.229> here

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.100 

flat<00:06:44.040> on<00:06:44.070> there<00:06:44.610> and<00:06:44.880> these<00:06:45.330> two<00:06:45.390> points

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.110 
flat on there and these two points

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.530 
flat on there and these two points
touching<00:06:46.590> the<00:06:46.710> wheel<00:06:47.120> tightened<00:06:48.120> it<00:06:48.180> up<00:06:48.300> and

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:48.540 
touching the wheel tightened it up and

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.200 
touching the wheel tightened it up and
I've<00:06:48.630> said<00:06:48.930> it<00:06:48.960> 60<00:06:49.500> degrees<00:06:49.890> and<00:06:50.880> it's<00:06:51.090> a

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:51.210 
I've said it 60 degrees and it's a

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.410 
I've said it 60 degrees and it's a
repeatable<00:06:51.870> angle<00:06:52.410> time<00:06:52.710> after<00:06:53.160> time<00:06:53.420> what

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:54.420 
repeatable angle time after time what

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:58.160 
repeatable angle time after time what
I've<00:06:54.540> done<00:06:54.810> in<00:06:55.140> order<00:06:55.320> to<00:06:55.500> do<00:06:55.920> this<00:06:56.690> to<00:06:57.690> make

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:58.170 
I've done in order to do this to make

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.340 
I've done in order to do this to make
these<00:06:58.500> I<00:06:58.830> start<00:06:59.340> up<00:06:59.520> like<00:06:59.820> if<00:07:00.780> I<00:07:00.930> wanted<00:07:01.230> a

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:01.350 
these I start up like if I wanted a

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:04.760 
these I start up like if I wanted a
60-degree<00:07:02.190> one<00:07:02.400> I'd<00:07:02.580> come<00:07:02.880> and<00:07:03.350> draw<00:07:04.350> an<00:07:04.530> arc

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:04.770 
60-degree one I'd come and draw an arc

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:05.360 
60-degree one I'd come and draw an arc
there

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:05.370 
there

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:08.750 
there
cut<00:07:05.610> it<00:07:05.730> out<00:07:05.850> on<00:07:06.090> the<00:07:06.210> bandsaw<00:07:06.720> and<00:07:07.550> after<00:07:08.550> that

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:08.760 
cut it out on the bandsaw and after that

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:12.440 
cut it out on the bandsaw and after that
then<00:07:09.060> I<00:07:09.380> relieve<00:07:10.380> it<00:07:10.590> in<00:07:10.740> here<00:07:11.130> so<00:07:11.490> that<00:07:11.790> will

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:12.450 
then I relieve it in here so that will

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:16.730 
then I relieve it in here so that will
compensate<00:07:13.020> for<00:07:13.940> wheel<00:07:14.940> wear<00:07:15.530> that's<00:07:16.530> how<00:07:16.710> I

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:16.740 
compensate for wheel wear that's how I

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.820 
compensate for wheel wear that's how I
get<00:07:16.920> repeatability<00:07:17.730> on<00:07:18.240> an<00:07:18.540> adjustable<00:07:19.440> tool

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:19.830 
get repeatability on an adjustable tool

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.160 
get repeatability on an adjustable tool
wrist
