like<00:02:52.170> if<00:02:52.260> you're<00:02:52.380> having<00:02:52.530> a<00:02:52.650> classroom<00:02:52.950> and

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
like if you're having a classroom and

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.380 
like if you're having a classroom and
you<00:02:53.310> want<00:02:53.459> to<00:02:53.519> show<00:02:53.640> some<00:02:53.880> of<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:54.030> switches

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
you want to show some of the switches

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.729 
you want to show some of the switches
and<00:02:54.420> our<00:02:54.570> adversaries<00:02:55.110> have<00:02:55.170> actually<00:02:55.530> used

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
and our adversaries have actually used

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.800 
and our adversaries have actually used
this<00:02:56.310> is<00:02:56.519> a<00:02:56.549> good<00:02:56.760> way<00:02:56.880> to<00:02:56.940> do<00:02:57.120> it<00:02:57.150> just<00:02:57.450> so

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
this is a good way to do it just so

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.090 
this is a good way to do it just so
people<00:02:57.989> can<00:02:58.110> really<00:02:58.380> put<00:02:58.620> their<00:02:58.739> hands<00:02:58.950> on

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
people can really put their hands on

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.140 
people can really put their hands on
something<00:02:59.370> that<00:02:59.489> works<00:02:59.760> they're<00:03:00.000> all

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
something that works they're all

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.910 
something that works they're all
actually<00:03:00.510> in<00:03:01.200> circuit<00:03:01.620> they're<00:03:01.769> all

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
actually in circuit they're all

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.500 
actually in circuit they're all
functional<00:03:02.459> at<00:03:02.519> this<00:03:02.670> time<00:03:02.910> like<00:03:03.180> if<00:03:03.299> you<00:03:03.360> take

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
functional at this time like if you take

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:04.910 
functional at this time like if you take
that<00:03:03.660> an<00:03:03.870> upper<00:03:04.079> left-hand<00:03:04.410> corner<00:03:04.799> of<00:03:04.829> the

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
that an upper left-hand corner of the

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.009 
that an upper left-hand corner of the
clothespin<00:03:05.310> device<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:06.359> just<00:03:06.420> grab<00:03:06.870> that

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
clothespin device and just grab that

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.780 
clothespin device and just grab that
metal<00:03:07.320> ring<00:03:07.470> and<00:03:07.500> pull<00:03:07.739> it<00:03:07.859> out<00:03:07.950> like<00:03:08.640> if<00:03:08.730> you

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
metal ring and pull it out like if you

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.430 
metal ring and pull it out like if you
had<00:03:08.880> a<00:03:08.910> tripwire<00:03:09.209> tie<00:03:09.600> to<00:03:09.660> that<00:03:12.230> that<00:03:13.230> just

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
had a tripwire tie to that that just

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.199 
had a tripwire tie to that that just
signifies<00:03:13.829> that<00:03:14.010> you<00:03:14.400> know<00:03:14.609> an<00:03:14.700> explosive

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
signifies that you know an explosive

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.940 
signifies that you know an explosive
would<00:03:15.329> actually<00:03:15.690> detonate<00:03:16.049> it<00:03:16.140> at<00:03:16.590> that<00:03:16.739> time

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
would actually detonate it at that time

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.710 
would actually detonate it at that time
you<00:03:17.489> know<00:03:17.609> aside<00:03:17.970> from<00:03:18.150> this<00:03:18.329> but<00:03:18.480> a<00:03:18.510> lot<00:03:18.600> of

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
you know aside from this but a lot of

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.420 
you know aside from this but a lot of
parts<00:03:18.959> that<00:03:19.019> are<00:03:19.200> used<00:03:19.440> in<00:03:19.739> the<00:03:20.070> making<00:03:20.220> of

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
parts that are used in the making of

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.949 
parts that are used in the making of
