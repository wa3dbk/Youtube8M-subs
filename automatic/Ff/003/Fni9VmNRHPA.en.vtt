now<00:00:07.740> we're<00:00:07.890> going<00:00:08.040> to<00:00:08.130> show<00:00:08.370> you<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:08.670> process

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
now we're going to show you the process

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.759 
now we're going to show you the process
of<00:00:09.210> folding<00:00:09.660> and<00:00:09.780> unfolding<00:00:09.840> the<00:00:10.380> bike<00:00:10.530> the

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
of folding and unfolding the bike the

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.379 
of folding and unfolding the bike the
most<00:00:10.950> fundamental<00:00:11.550> part<00:00:11.849> of<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.150> product

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
most fundamental part of the product

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.060 
most fundamental part of the product
we're<00:00:12.750> going<00:00:12.780> to<00:00:13.049> start<00:00:13.320> with<00:00:13.440> a<00:00:13.469> folded<00:00:13.860> bike

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
we're going to start with a folded bike

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.890 
we're going to start with a folded bike
and<00:00:14.400> we<00:00:14.700> will<00:00:14.820> unfold<00:00:15.240> it<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:15.599> show<00:00:15.719> you<00:00:15.750> how

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
and we will unfold it and show you how

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.990 
and we will unfold it and show you how
to<00:00:16.020> unfold<00:00:16.680> it<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:16.949> rider<00:00:17.220> ball<00:00:17.430> state<00:00:17.730> and

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
to unfold it to a rider ball state and

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.580 
to unfold it to a rider ball state and
then<00:00:18.390> we'll<00:00:18.510> take<00:00:18.690> it<00:00:18.840> back<00:00:19.020> down<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.500> the

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
then we'll take it back down to the

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.710 
then we'll take it back down to the
folded<00:00:19.920> package<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:21.029> then<00:00:21.119> finally<00:00:21.570> we'll

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
folded package and then finally we'll

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.359 
folded package and then finally we'll
talk<00:00:21.930> through<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.260> few<00:00:22.320> issues<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.980> folding

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
talk through a few issues the folding

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.640 
talk through a few issues the folding
and<00:00:23.460> why<00:00:23.609> it's<00:00:23.789> done<00:00:23.970> in<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.269> way<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:24.900> is<00:00:25.019> to

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
and why it's done in the way it is to

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.529 
and why it's done in the way it is to
avoid<00:00:25.890> any<00:00:26.039> problems<00:00:26.550> so<00:00:26.939> we'll<00:00:27.269> start<00:00:27.480> off

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
avoid any problems so we'll start off

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.669 
avoid any problems so we'll start off
with<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.810> folded<00:00:28.109> bike<00:00:30.080> so<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.199> first<00:00:31.439> stage

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
with the folded bike so the first stage

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.670 
with the folded bike so the first stage
is<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.130> unclip<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.640> folded<00:00:32.969> pedal<00:00:33.380> then<00:00:34.380> raise

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
is to unclip the folded pedal then raise

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.200 
is to unclip the folded pedal then raise
the<00:00:35.010> saddle<00:00:35.340> up<00:00:36.920> this<00:00:37.920> point<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.340> handlebar

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
the saddle up this point the handlebar

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.959 
the saddle up this point the handlebar
support<00:00:39.570> needs<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.840> be<00:00:39.930> raised<00:00:40.230> up<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:40.530> you

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
support needs to be raised up so you

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:44.150 
support needs to be raised up so you
swing<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.120> round<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.750> then<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.860> need<00:00:44.010> to

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
swing that round and then you need to

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.760 
swing that round and then you need to
tighten<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.329> catch<00:00:45.690> on<00:00:46.140> down<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.500> on<00:00:46.649> the

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
tighten the catch on down that on the

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.180 
tighten the catch on down that on the
hinge<00:00:47.149> and<00:00:48.149> then<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.420> lift<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:49.050> bike<00:00:49.200> and

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
hinge and then you lift the bike and

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.529 
hinge and then you lift the bike and
rotate<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.670> front<00:00:50.820> wheel<00:00:51.030> around<00:00:51.360> that

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
rotate the front wheel around that

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.369 
rotate the front wheel around that
allows<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.170> front<00:00:52.620> wheel<00:00:52.770> hook<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:54.110> clear<00:00:55.110> the

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
allows the front wheel hook to clear the

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.220 
allows the front wheel hook to clear the
frame<00:00:55.739> there<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.539> tighten<00:00:57.539> up<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.780> main

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
frame there and tighten up the main

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.380 
frame there and tighten up the main
frame<00:00:58.530> hinge<00:00:58.859> at<00:00:59.550> this<00:00:59.699> point<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.090> can<00:01:00.359> then

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
frame hinge at this point you can then

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.869 
frame hinge at this point you can then
just<00:01:00.809> swing<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.590> back<00:01:01.739> wheel<00:01:01.949> out<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.460> it's

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
just swing the back wheel out and it's

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.060 
just swing the back wheel out and it's
been<00:01:03.000> held<00:01:03.270> in<00:01:03.420> place<00:01:03.570> by<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.470> rear<00:01:04.769> frame

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
been held in place by the rear frame

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.859 
been held in place by the rear frame
clip<00:01:05.369> now<00:01:05.909> this<00:01:06.030> is<00:01:06.150> a<00:01:06.180> feature<00:01:06.420> that's<00:01:06.720> been

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
clip now this is a feature that's been

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.170 
clip now this is a feature that's been
on<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.110> bikes<00:01:07.290> for<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.530> couple<00:01:07.799> years<00:01:08.010> now<00:01:08.180> if

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
on the bikes for a couple years now if

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.640 
on the bikes for a couple years now if
you<00:01:09.330> have<00:01:09.450> an<00:01:09.540> older<00:01:09.840> Brompton<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.409> can

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
you have an older Brompton you can

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.560 
you have an older Brompton you can
retrofit<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.490> rear<00:01:11.640> frame<00:01:11.850> clip<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:12.450> if

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
retrofit the rear frame clip so if

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.060 
retrofit the rear frame clip so if
you've<00:01:12.720> got<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.840> bike<00:01:13.049> without<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.830> can

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
you've got a bike without that you can

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.950 
you've got a bike without that you can
add<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.369> on<00:01:14.490> but<00:01:15.060> all<00:01:15.210> current<00:01:15.600> production

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
add it on but all current production

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.080 
add it on but all current production
bikes<00:01:16.110> come<00:01:16.380> with<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.680> fitted<00:01:17.100> so<00:01:17.759> at<00:01:17.939> this

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
bikes come with that fitted so at this

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.640 
bikes come with that fitted so at this
point<00:01:18.360> we<00:01:18.570> now<00:01:18.689> have<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:18.900> bike<00:01:19.140> that's<00:01:19.350> ready<00:01:19.560> to

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
point we now have a bike that's ready to

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.550 
point we now have a bike that's ready to
ride<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.450> now<00:01:21.450> we<00:01:21.509> can<00:01:21.780> look<00:01:21.930> at<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.110> process

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
ride and now we can look at the process

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.280 
ride and now we can look at the process
of<00:01:22.740> folding<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.159> bike<00:01:23.369> again<00:01:23.549> so<00:01:24.299> we<00:01:25.020> start

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
of folding the bike again so we start

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.840 
of folding the bike again so we start
off<00:01:25.320> by<00:01:25.530> releasing<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.009> rear<00:01:26.159> frame<00:01:26.369> clip<00:01:26.640> and

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
off by releasing the rear frame clip and

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.510 
off by releasing the rear frame clip and
parking<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.840> back<00:01:28.020> wheel<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.530> this<00:01:29.040> state<00:01:29.340> we

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
parking the back wheel and this state we

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.060 
parking the back wheel and this state we
call<00:01:29.759> this<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.060> parked<00:01:30.479> position<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.200> then

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
call this the parked position and then

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.870 
call this the parked position and then
from<00:01:32.310> there<00:01:32.549> we<00:01:33.240> can<00:01:33.479> undo<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.640> main<00:01:35.640> frame

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
from there we can undo the main frame

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.819 
from there we can undo the main frame
hinge<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.509> swing<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.170> way<00:01:37.290> around<00:01:37.590> again

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
hinge and swing the way around again

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.679 
hinge and swing the way around again
lifting<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.670> allow<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.880> hook<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.540> go

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
lifting that to allow the hook to go

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.740 
lifting that to allow the hook to go
over<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.079> chainstay

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
over the chainstay

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.859 
over the chainstay
now<00:01:42.750> we're<00:01:42.930> undoing<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.530> handlebar<00:01:44.869> support

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
now we're undoing the handlebar support

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.380 
now we're undoing the handlebar support
hinge<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:47.100> swings<00:01:47.430> into<00:01:47.640> its<00:01:47.880> clip<00:01:48.149> and

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
hinge and that swings into its clip and

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.730 
hinge and that swings into its clip and
then<00:01:49.070> lower<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.250> saddle<00:01:51.170> and<00:01:52.170> pull<00:01:52.530> the

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
then lower the saddle and pull the

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.730 
then lower the saddle and pull the
folding<00:01:53.340> pedal<00:01:53.640> up<00:01:53.759> and<00:01:54.439> put<00:01:55.439> that<00:01:55.560> into

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
folding pedal up and put that into

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.999 
folding pedal up and put that into
position<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.490> there's<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.090> bike<00:01:57.240> ready<00:01:58.009> for

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
position and there's the bike ready for

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.920 
position and there's the bike ready for
storage<00:01:59.310> or<00:01:59.759> what-have-you<00:02:00.240> it's<00:02:00.719> fully

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
storage or what-have-you it's fully

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.700 
storage or what-have-you it's fully
folded<00:02:01.350> state<00:02:02.600> at<00:02:03.600> this<00:02:03.780> point<00:02:03.899> we'll<00:02:04.259> talk

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
folded state at this point we'll talk

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.929 
folded state at this point we'll talk
about<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:04.979> couple<00:02:05.189> of<00:02:05.340> issues<00:02:05.460> with<00:02:05.700> the

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
about a couple of issues with the

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.490 
about a couple of issues with the
folding<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.479> reason<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:06.990> it's<00:02:07.110> done<00:02:07.259> in<00:02:07.409> the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
folding the reason that it's done in the

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.460 
folding the reason that it's done in the
order<00:02:07.740> that<00:02:07.860> is<00:02:08.099> is<00:02:08.660> for<00:02:09.660> basically

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
order that is is for basically

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.650 
order that is is for basically
ease-of-use<00:02:10.760> the<00:02:11.760> rear<00:02:11.940> frame<00:02:12.150> is<00:02:12.330> held<00:02:12.540> in

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
ease-of-use the rear frame is held in

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.910 
ease-of-use the rear frame is held in
place<00:02:12.750> by<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:13.080> seat<00:02:13.319> post<00:02:13.500> there

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
place by the seat post there

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.790 
place by the seat post there
for<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.459> seatpost<00:02:14.700> is<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.599> be<00:02:16.050> first<00:02:16.380> and<00:02:16.709> the

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
for the seatpost is the be first and the

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.760 
for the seatpost is the be first and the
last<00:02:17.010> thing<00:02:17.370> to<00:02:18.209> be<00:02:18.239> folded<00:02:18.959> or<00:02:19.050> unfolded<00:02:19.560> so

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
last thing to be folded or unfolded so

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.610 
last thing to be folded or unfolded so
if<00:02:20.010> we<00:02:20.370> now<00:02:20.489> take<00:02:20.550> the<00:02:20.819> seat<00:02:21.120> post<00:02:21.330> up<00:02:22.260> and

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
if we now take the seat post up and

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.860 
if we now take the seat post up and
extend<00:02:23.010> it<00:02:23.190> you'll<00:02:23.340> see<00:02:23.580> that<00:02:23.610> it's<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:24.690> bike

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
extend it you'll see that it's the bike

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.180 
extend it you'll see that it's the bike
is<00:02:25.020> no<00:02:25.140> longer<00:02:25.349> held<00:02:25.530> together<00:02:25.709> so<00:02:26.040> if<00:02:26.099> you

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
is no longer held together so if you

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.920 
is no longer held together so if you
pick<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.550> bike<00:02:26.700> up<00:02:26.910> it<00:02:27.150> will<00:02:27.300> simply<00:02:27.690> fall

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
pick the bike up it will simply fall

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.229 
pick the bike up it will simply fall
apart<00:02:28.260> so<00:02:28.410> that's<00:02:28.560> why<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:29.430> seat<00:02:29.670> post<00:02:29.849> is<00:02:30.090> the

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
apart so that's why the seat post is the

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.330 
apart so that's why the seat post is the
first<00:02:30.480> thing<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:30.810> be<00:02:30.840> unfolded<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.709> last

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
first thing to be unfolded and the last

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.550 
first thing to be unfolded and the last
thing<00:02:32.550> to<00:02:32.670> be<00:02:32.760> folded<00:02:33.120> up<00:02:33.239> so<00:02:33.569> once<00:02:34.410> we<00:02:34.530> put

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
thing to be folded up so once we put

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.710 
thing to be folded up so once we put
that<00:02:34.800> back<00:02:34.950> down<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.850> whole<00:02:36.060> thing<00:02:36.330> is<00:02:36.480> held

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
that back down the whole thing is held

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:43.460 
that back down the whole thing is held
together<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:41.540> if<00:02:42.540> we<00:02:42.660> take<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:42.930> bike<00:02:43.080> back<00:02:43.290> to

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
together and if we take the bike back to

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.759 
together and if we take the bike back to
an<00:02:43.769> unfolded<00:02:44.370> state<00:02:44.519> you<00:02:45.060> can<00:02:45.239> see<00:02:45.450> why<00:02:45.840> the

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
an unfolded state you can see why the

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.020 
an unfolded state you can see why the
handlebar<00:02:47.489> catch<00:02:47.760> needs<00:02:48.209> to<00:02:48.420> be<00:02:48.569> folded

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
handlebar catch needs to be folded

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:57.020 
handlebar catch needs to be folded
secondly<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:55.290> handlebar<00:02:55.680> support<00:02:56.040> needs<00:02:56.940> to

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
secondly the handlebar support needs to

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.479 
secondly the handlebar support needs to
be<00:02:57.090> folded<00:02:57.420> after<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:58.019> main<00:02:58.200> frame<00:02:58.440> hinge<00:02:58.739> if

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
be folded after the main frame hinge if

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.000 
be folded after the main frame hinge if
at<00:02:59.760> this<00:02:59.880> point<00:03:00.000> you<00:03:00.390> try<00:03:00.750> and<00:03:01.140> fold<00:03:01.530> the

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
at this point you try and fold the

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.380 
at this point you try and fold the
handlebar<00:03:02.430> support<00:03:02.760> down<00:03:02.910> you'll<00:03:03.150> see<00:03:03.360> that

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
handlebar support down you'll see that

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.590 
handlebar support down you'll see that
the<00:03:03.630> cables<00:03:03.870> will<00:03:04.290> become<00:03:05.100> very<00:03:05.280> taut<00:03:05.670> and<00:03:05.970> it

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
the cables will become very taut and it

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.410 
the cables will become very taut and it
will<00:03:06.780> put<00:03:07.019> undue<00:03:07.920> stress<00:03:08.220> on<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.519> cables<00:03:08.910> you

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
will put undue stress on the cables you

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.940 
will put undue stress on the cables you
see<00:03:09.630> there<00:03:09.780> that<00:03:09.930> you<00:03:10.019> can't<00:03:10.319> fold<00:03:10.590> it<00:03:10.769> down

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
see there that you can't fold it down

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.650 
see there that you can't fold it down
properly<00:03:11.220> you<00:03:11.489> have<00:03:11.519> to<00:03:11.790> twist<00:03:11.940> it<00:03:12.239> and<00:03:12.510> do

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
properly you have to twist it and do

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.960 
properly you have to twist it and do
that<00:03:12.870> and<00:03:13.080> so<00:03:13.260> that's<00:03:13.950> not<00:03:14.220> an<00:03:14.340> ideal<00:03:14.430> way<00:03:14.940> of

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
that and so that's not an ideal way of

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.360 
that and so that's not an ideal way of
doing<00:03:15.120> it<00:03:15.680> whereas<00:03:16.680> if<00:03:16.709> we<00:03:16.860> do<00:03:17.010> it<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:17.160> correct

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
doing it whereas if we do it the correct

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.060 
doing it whereas if we do it the correct
way<00:03:17.580> by<00:03:18.079> folding<00:03:19.079> the<00:03:19.260> main<00:03:19.920> frame<00:03:20.190> first<00:03:22.070> you

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
way by folding the main frame first you

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.240 
way by folding the main frame first you
see<00:03:23.310> that<00:03:23.489> it<00:03:23.609> shortens<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.840> distance<00:03:25.250> from

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
see that it shortens the distance from

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.640 
see that it shortens the distance from
the<00:03:26.340> wheel<00:03:26.750> to<00:03:27.750> the<00:03:27.780> rear<00:03:28.019> of<00:03:28.049> the<00:03:28.170> bike<00:03:28.380> and

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
the wheel to the rear of the bike and

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.699 
the wheel to the rear of the bike and
allows<00:03:28.890> the<00:03:29.070> cables<00:03:30.200> more<00:03:31.200> room<00:03:31.410> to<00:03:31.440> maneuver

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
allows the cables more room to maneuver

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.550 
allows the cables more room to maneuver
and<00:03:32.190> it<00:03:32.700> can<00:03:32.850> be<00:03:32.970> drops<00:03:33.420> successfully<00:03:34.380> there

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
and it can be drops successfully there

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.640 
and it can be drops successfully there
so<00:03:34.799> that's<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.190> reason<00:03:35.340> we<00:03:35.549> do<00:03:35.700> that<00:03:36.500> so<00:03:37.500> it's

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
so that's the reason we do that so it's

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.020 
so that's the reason we do that so it's
extremely<00:03:37.890> important<00:03:38.519> to<00:03:38.609> follow<00:03:38.820> the

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
extremely important to follow the

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.430 
extremely important to follow the
correct<00:03:39.239> procedure<00:03:39.660> for<00:03:39.959> folding<00:03:40.290> and

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
correct procedure for folding and

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.710 
correct procedure for folding and
unfolding<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.950> bike<00:03:41.130> in<00:03:41.370> order<00:03:41.519> to<00:03:42.329> avoid<00:03:42.540> any

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
unfolding the bike in order to avoid any

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.539 
unfolding the bike in order to avoid any
problems<00:03:43.230> and<00:03:43.530> to<00:03:43.739> be<00:03:43.859> able<00:03:43.950> to<00:03:44.100> do<00:03:44.190> it<00:03:44.310> quickly

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
problems and to be able to do it quickly

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.600 
problems and to be able to do it quickly
and<00:03:44.910> easily
