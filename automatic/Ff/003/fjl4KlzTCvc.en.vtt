00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
on to high and I'm going to beat this

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.380 
on to high and I'm going to beat this
for<00:00:49.200> just<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.649> minute<00:00:49.829> or<00:00:50.010> two<00:00:50.039> at<00:00:50.969> this<00:00:51.120> point

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
for just a minute or two at this point

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.600 
for just a minute or two at this point
the<00:00:51.510> icing<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:52.230> kind<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.559> like<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.710> sticky<00:00:53.309> gluey

minutes<00:01:04.729> after<00:01:05.729> three<00:01:06.150> minutes<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.659> what

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
minutes after three minutes this is what

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.170 
minutes after three minutes this is what
the<00:01:07.020> consistency<00:01:07.650> should<00:01:07.680> look<00:01:08.010> like<00:01:08.220> if<00:01:09.119> you
