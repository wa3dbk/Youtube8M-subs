00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.920
 a video tutorial on how to perform the 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.020
 special moves in code advance 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.570
 wars hurts like you can read it even in 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.369
 title that is referring of course to the new 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.730
 call of duty coming out now in November 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.560
 of 2014 and the first thing you go 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.960
 Watching this video is yes I am 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.000
 playing koff ducci you do not 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.460
 You will find so many decod videos here in the 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.710
 my channel this is the people's duty is the fact 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.320
 that the last cuts were not 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.870
 My pleasure, but I do like yes, it 's call. 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.879
 of duty I'm obviously bringing a video 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.129
 which occurs in which he overcame speaking 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.910
 Because I liked the game, I'm enjoying it. 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.190
 to play 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.649
 It would matter the game to the point of wanting 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.149
 record a video tutorial for you guys 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.710
 of course I could talk much more 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.690
 things about this game because it has 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.730
 enough thing to talk about it has 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.079
 a lot of people making videos about him more 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.550
 I did not find any videos on 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.619
 Portuguese speaking about the 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.090
 special moves that loves 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.270
 main characteristics of this new 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.369
 code is that it is the movements that are 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.830
 allowed through the exoskeleton of 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.740
 every soldier carries on his back, right? 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.750
 in a special vest then this video 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.210
 will be a tutorial on this right until the 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.310
 people you are looking for are videos 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.380
 to know how to move about. 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.930
 and do not find so I decided to do it here 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.450
 for you because to dominate this 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.390
 new code you need to know how to use 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.479
 the special moves and at least you 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.460
 You need to master it, they're all for you. 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.200
 able to play because in ever better 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.520
 so the people who are going to get well in 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.320
 dress code holidays are the 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.420
 people who can master this 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.520
 movement that makes the big difference that 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.430
 is the great feature of this game 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.220
 I'm playing on the pc but the structure is going 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.200
 serve for any platform then 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.119
 starting here our tutorial you have is 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.159
 the normal movements of any 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.750
 shoes you can walk back side 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:05.759
 I threw myself down to run and jump 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.700
 usually without requiring that everyone with 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.039
 the movements are special and of course 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.260
 I came here to explain the same 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.160
 movements would be the movements of the 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.530
 that squirrel 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.240
 so first you have a bush of 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.460
 anp also known as 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.800
 double jump that when you jump 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.690
 usually and with the 2nd jump you 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.210
 can give a bigger boost in the air 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.040
 So you hit the jump button. 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.740
 twice it will give a good boost 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.280
 High getting yesterday, everything much higher. 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:37.230
 what a common leap you have too 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.990
 a right booth you can perform 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.850
 dodge sideways or backwards 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.620
 you press the jog button and 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.680
 dresch on your doll to one side 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.600
 he will perform this movement, I will not 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.730
 I know if it works on consoles but on pc 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.220
 Can you give him a double tepee? 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.470
 until you do fighting games that you 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.900
 two directional signs and your 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.880
 doll performs the fastest movement 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.040
 Where are you heading to? 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.900
 in case if you think twice as well 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.670
 he quickly goes to the left and you 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.350
 fast two times fast and it will 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.420
 to the right and got tight 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.880
 twice as much fast it goes back 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.340
 you can not go to both for today 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.010
 front but this can easily be 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:19.170
 You only need to press the 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:22.560
 puerile button to run forward and 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:25.050
 Can you give a dodge forward? 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.350
 then combining the two techniques you 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.780
 has bulls 10 that would basically be the 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.120
 bojan was registered with bulldog 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.190
 so you can give the new hujm anp says 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.470
 that goes to the sides forward or 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.630
 back and to do that is just 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.910
 perform both movements is based on 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.190
 in the movements you give a bust of anp 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.050
 when you're in the air you give a dowry 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.310
 to either side he goes 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:51.870
 run the bulls must china is 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.700
 ducking in the air after a 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.070
 move that I think is one of the coolest 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.560
 of the game is that it is the bo xilai guinÃ© that 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:01.320
 When you come running and you think 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.020
 few meters forward is driven 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:06.930
 for your skeleton so you give this 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.000
 career and drags forward and gives 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.360
 a faster boost so you 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.850
 can cross to the other side of the 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.950
 map with some agility is more 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.169
 quickly and to do this you need 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.750
 be running and when it's right 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:24.330
 You press the crouch button, do not throw the 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.260
 thinking that it will give to this slide 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.100
 front right 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.290
 and last and my favorite is bo 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.420
 lenny that is the movement that is where the 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.910
 movement of these special movements 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.550
 that he can deal damage is then when 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:41.210
 you are performing a motion in the 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:44.750
 air you press the crouch button in the air 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.550
 and it gives a downward push is and with the 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.770
 speed of this impulse coming to 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.050
 low he can do damage in area 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.580
 even if you can get the 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.730
 head of a person 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.920
 You can kill the person so it's unique. 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.650
 special movement that can damage and 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.690
 kill your enemies including the 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.730
 scammer can be used for you to quit 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.770
 fast air is because it 's not good you 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.780
 jumping gets very exposed then 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.030
 when you see that you are very exposed 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.430
 flying up there you squeeze the bucks 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:16.550
 take it and faster to the ground and 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.380
 do not get too much outdoors and exposed 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.150
 for everyone to shoot you 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.160
 the charging time for you 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.620
 repeat the same movement animals or 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.780
 at least two seconds you do not need 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.090
 necessarily wait two seconds 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.800
 to do all this movement you can 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.140
 combat all the movements that I 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.940
 I spoke and do everything at once, right? 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:37.550
 So what I like to do is cross 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.380
 the map quickly for example is 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.210
 first ever the bulls slide he goes 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.800
 give that career on the ground 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:47.570
 it was drawn bloom 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:50.060
 quickly I give jamp of the ingested 1.1 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:52.040
 Leave it alone, he'll get a 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:55.130
 slightly higher forward and then the 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:57.260
 corn to the ground and close to the bulls slam 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.720
 so I can do all the 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:03.500
 movements in the single as without needing 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.970
 load the time of each of each 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.100
 look no 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:09.020
 What you need to know is also that 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:11.090
 not only dominate the movements that you 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.100
 will be an expert in the game you too 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.710
 need to know that this is the movement 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.420
 they make noise and consequently 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.880
 end carry on the map nÃ© 

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:22.430
 Only you can fool this too. 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:25.340
 putting some pecs in there is a 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:27.230
 pact called andrÃ© supresso that will 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.760
 initiate its developments and 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:31.220
 consequently will make you 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:34.310
 did not appear on the map of the mini map 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:36.740
 when you use these movements, right? 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:38.780
 there is also another very useful pec for 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.230
 combine with the movements that are called 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.570
 the hat that 

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:45.120
 is very useful to match the race 

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:47.790
 and also with bulls slide, because with 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:50.250
 he can shoot while running and 

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:53.040
 also when you slide is when you 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:54.810
 gives the boot slide nÃ© then until a pr can 

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.660
 be considered after a pec 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:58.560
 power is because he is special 

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.000
 too much 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.980
 So people, I hope it's called. 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.370
 learned that the secret of the code of 

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:07.260
 party hurts are you controlling them 

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:10.920
 movements in this you finish jesus 

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:13.650
 movements with a certain skill is quite capable 

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:16.080
 You're a great player. 

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:18.150
 In this game I hope you have 

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.490
 liked this tutorial if you have 

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:21.600
 liked grip on pocket full to say 

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:23.430
