00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
they break the all the features because

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.420 
they break the all the features because
of<00:02:10.009> how<00:02:10.129> things<00:02:10.399> have<00:02:10.610> changed

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
in commands and the coding and stuff

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.740 
in commands and the coding and stuff
like<00:02:13.739> that<00:02:14.189> so<00:02:14.400> after<00:02:14.670> teasing<00:02:14.909> us<00:02:15.299> for<00:02:15.569> so

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750

posted the image of the front of a
command<00:02:27.269> block<00:02:27.450> so<00:02:27.810> this<00:02:27.989> was<00:02:28.200> the

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
command block so this was the

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.649

based world a lot of people have used

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.599 
based world a lot of people have used
wool<00:03:23.940> for<00:03:24.510> example<00:03:24.989> they've<00:03:25.230> used<00:03:25.590> red<00:03:25.980> yellow

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
wool for example they've used red yellow

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:27.140 
wool for example they've used red yellow
and<00:03:26.639> blue

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
and blue

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.330 
and blue
they'll<00:03:27.750> have<00:03:27.989> lines<00:03:28.290> and<00:03:28.620> lines<00:03:28.829> of<00:03:29.159> these

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
they'll have lines and lines of these

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.890 
they'll have lines and lines of these
specific<00:03:29.849> colors<00:03:30.209> and<00:03:30.419> then<00:03:30.569> I'll<00:03:30.690> have

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
specific colors and then I'll have

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.720 
specific colors and then I'll have
command<00:03:31.290> blocks<00:03:31.500> from<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:31.799> neat<00:03:31.949> bit<00:03:32.190> with

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
command blocks from the neat bit with

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.180 
command blocks from the neat bit with
different<00:03:32.760> type<00:03:33.480> of<00:03:33.690> variations<00:03:34.349> and<00:03:34.590> changes

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
different type of variations and changes

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.069 
different type of variations and changes
now<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:35.819> fact<00:03:36.150> that<00:03:36.269> you<00:03:36.419> can<00:03:36.599> have<00:03:36.780> color

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
now the fact that you can have color

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.990 
now the fact that you can have color
command<00:03:37.500> blocks<00:03:37.799> means<00:03:38.250> that<00:03:38.459> people<00:03:38.819> will

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
command blocks means that people will

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.270 
command blocks means that people will
then<00:03:39.299> realize<00:03:39.870> where<00:03:40.620> they<00:03:40.739> put<00:03:40.949> a<00:03:40.979> specific

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
then realize where they put a specific

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.129 
then realize where they put a specific
command<00:03:42.000> and<00:03:42.239> I'm<00:03:42.299> guessing<00:03:42.750> this<00:03:42.870> is<00:03:43.019> how

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:43.139 
command and I'm guessing this is how

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:43.909 
command and I'm guessing this is how
it's<00:03:43.349> gonna<00:03:43.530> work

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:43.919 
it's gonna work

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:46.309 
it's gonna work
the<00:03:44.489> only<00:03:44.819> confusion<00:03:45.269> I<00:03:45.449> have<00:03:45.659> with<00:03:45.870> this<00:03:46.049> is

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
the only confusion I have with this is

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.379 
the only confusion I have with this is
that<00:03:46.650> if<00:03:46.769> you<00:03:46.889> look<00:03:47.129> closely<00:03:47.430> at<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:47.909> blocks

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
that if you look closely at the blocks

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.300 
that if you look closely at the blocks
it<00:03:48.540> looks<00:03:48.750> like<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:49.019> command<00:03:49.379> block<00:03:49.590> is<00:03:49.799> on

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
it looks like the command block is on

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.180 
it looks like the command block is on
stone<00:03:51.209> or<00:03:51.510> inside<00:03:51.959> stone<00:03:52.349> so<00:03:52.680> I<00:03:52.709> really<00:03:53.010> don't

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
stone or inside stone so I really don't

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.229 
stone or inside stone so I really don't
know<00:03:53.310> what<00:03:53.489> they're<00:03:53.609> gonna<00:03:53.669> be<00:03:53.879> doing<00:03:54.150> with

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
know what they're gonna be doing with

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.479 
know what they're gonna be doing with
that<00:03:54.359> overall<00:03:54.930> now<00:03:55.470> I<00:03:55.500> got<00:03:55.829> super<00:03:56.220> curious

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
that overall now I got super curious

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.300 
that overall now I got super curious
with<00:03:56.909> the<00:03:56.940> images<00:03:57.540> he<00:03:57.750> was<00:03:57.989> posting<00:03:58.620> so<00:03:59.220> I'm

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
with the images he was posting so I'm

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.649 
with the images he was posting so I'm
gonna<00:03:59.430> did<00:03:59.669> a<00:03:59.699> little<00:03:59.819> bit<00:03:59.940> of<00:04:00.030> research<00:04:00.359> to

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:00.659 
gonna did a little bit of research to

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:02.659 
gonna did a little bit of research to
see<00:04:00.810> if<00:04:00.900> I<00:04:01.019> could<00:04:01.199> find<00:04:01.379> anything<00:04:01.829> based<00:04:02.430> a

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:02.669 
see if I could find anything based a

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:04.399 
see if I could find anything based a
colored<00:04:03.000> command<00:04:03.449> block<00:04:03.690> and<00:04:03.959> I<00:04:04.109> believe

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:04.409 
colored command block and I believe

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:06.649 
colored command block and I believe
there<00:04:04.680> was<00:04:04.739> a<00:04:04.799> few<00:04:05.129> mods<00:04:05.340> out<00:04:05.609> there<00:04:05.909> and<00:04:06.150> here

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:06.659 
there was a few mods out there and here

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:09.229 
there was a few mods out there and here

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
is a specific image I did find all the

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.270 
is a specific image I did find all the
colored<00:04:09.599> command<00:04:10.049> blocks<00:04:10.319> people<00:04:10.709> have<00:04:11.040> used

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
colored command blocks people have used

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.430

them<00:04:11.430> in<00:04:11.549> the<00:04:11.699> past<00:04:11.729> to<00:04:12.540> recognize<00:04:13.019> where<00:04:13.349> they

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
them in the past to recognize where they

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.800 
them in the past to recognize where they
place<00:04:13.709> specific<00:04:14.310> commands<00:04:14.849> and<00:04:15.060> again<00:04:15.359> I'm
