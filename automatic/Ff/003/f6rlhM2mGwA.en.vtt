 like you, I already told you a little while ago 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.380
 and this means that combined time 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.420
 we will turn off our device 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.519
 we should turn it back on through the 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.189
 computer then connect it computer and 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.859
 use the application of the 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.779
 dev team anyway guys let's get started 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.969
 immediately with the video so you do not see that 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.380
 my iphone 4 because this video 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.649
 available only for those who 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:41.399
 have a iphone 4 3gs or otherwise a 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.559
 device with an a4 processor then 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.940

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.500
 so now let me show you a moment 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.730
 now let's go connect it to the computer 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.399
 like I did 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.399
 you can see connected to the computer and 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.379
 put it in dfu mode than in a 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.570
 previous video trip illustrated how 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.260
 so let's keep 3,000 for 3 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.670
 seconds the power button 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.369
 sorry for 3 seconds after switching on 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.430
 then for ten both texts and finally 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:18.409
 for 15 only the key was then 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.409
 let's start 3 2 1 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.689
 now i'm putting my device 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.250
 mode dfu mode the computer already 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:38.179
 recognized then we move now 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.069
 on mac 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:42.200
 that's it done now we'll just have to 

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:44.630
 click on the extras version of 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:50.750

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:54.829
 p3 we click on select ips ips is known 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:58.039

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:59.439
 downloadable ios 6.0 firmware 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:02.179
 obviously on the internet 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.799
 obviously in a very simple way 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:06.739
 we open and says it has been recognized 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:09.039
 click on ok click on beck e 

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:11.060
 now we click on jaibreak now it is 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:14.120
 obviously is preparing the jailbreak 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.989
 really very simple 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.280
 click on next and now of course is 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:27.950
 also performing gebras on the nel 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:34.810
 device remind you of a jailbreak 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:34.810
 tethered for different 6.1 released yesterday 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:42.889
 now we are members also see what is 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:51.560
 see on my iphone 4 because now 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:53.359
 is doing the usual procedures and 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.609
 however once it is finished 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:57.590
 this procedure will not be immediate 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:59.420
 silvia but we will have to make another 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.010
 procedure really really a lot 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.630
 simple 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:06.349
 here as you must see I mean on the mac is 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:08.000
 this warning appeared, telling us 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.319
 precisely that the type jailbreak 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.230
 tethered and then turn it back on every time 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:14.389
 we will have to click on extras and click on 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.870
 just boot so still enough 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:22.040
 simple now we have come to this 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:25.099
 point where there is the usual anas of note 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.290
 from scratch and it's ending 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:29.480
 let's say the first part of the gip break 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.760
 because now I will show you 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.500
 what we must do 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.569
 simply to make a species 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.330
 of this procedure only 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.190
 clicking on extras 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.870
 then just boot the procedure that 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.740
 we should do whenever we want 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.120
 turn our device back on 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.820
 as you can now see you are going to 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.850
 turn the device back on but now 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.800
 you will notice that cydia will not be there 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.500
 in fact now we will have to do that 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.240
 just boot procedure that every qual 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.430
 time we would like to re-light ours 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.110
 device we will have to do then 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:06.880
 now let's go immediately to unlock the 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:09.880
 our iphone 4 or 3gs or ipod anyway 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.820
 fourth generation touch and how it should 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.410
 so seeing cydia will not be there now 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.090
 we should do just that 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.390
 just boot process 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:36.340
 so let 's put the tar device 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:42.990
 dfu mode 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 10 9 8 7 6 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:45.460
 5 4 3 2 1 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.190
 ok guys now it's been recognized 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.160
 on my mac it is known for the second one 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.900
 time I should go dino fu extras 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:56.430
 select and services again 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:59.080
 this file here the ios firmware if you are 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.270
 here he says he was recognized as 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.640
 first we carry out this and then we will click 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.440
 on just boot right now now 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.980
 it's helping the process more or less 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:11.590
 may seem similar to the one before 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:13.930
 for the most part it is so now 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.200
 you're just doing a reboot 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.370
 that whenever I repeat it you must 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:22.030
 turn on the device because you have it 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.490
 off or various stuff you will have to make 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.419
 this procedure 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.729
 however don't worry because 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:30.880
 Sunday should come out algebre counter 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:32.950
 and yet for those who are now 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:36.070
 plotting of you wanted to have a 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:37.290
 jailbreak on your device can 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:41.229
 use this method 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:43.840
 so now let's move the man up on 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:46.150
 iphone to see if it is installed 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:49.479
 the iphone is on again now 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.680
 let's see if siga will be there now as it should 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:55.060
 see it freeze 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:58.570
 on my iphone with 6.1 here 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:01.570
 we select what I am and put it 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:07.900
 in step with the symbol 22 because I up 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:11.740
 to yesterday the tethered jailbreak of ios 6.0 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:16.180
 it seems to me you are obviously the symbol 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:18.669
 that is, the two new features still as notification 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:21.430
 since yesterday from the day before yesterday I do not remember 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:24.130
 as as you can see now cydia is 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:26.229
 installed on my device now 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:28.539
 I'll show you why it's not a trick 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:30.280
 it's nothing like that 

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:33.669
 we mark on general updates 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:35.560
 software as you can see on us 6.1 the 

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:37.240
 2 alger motorcycle software so guys 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:42.160
 this is a very simple method for 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:45.729
 having ios 6 and 6.1 with the jailbreak is 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:49.240
 I also want to say that for every repetition 

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:51.490
 that's for when he tells you to select the 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.120
 file you see the ship's firmware 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.389
 ios 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.380
 6 because now I've tried and 6.0.1 mi 

00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:58.889
 it seems that it is not yet compatible 

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:01.510
 with that version of redsnow then 

00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:04.270
 select I ios firmware tried 

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:05.710
