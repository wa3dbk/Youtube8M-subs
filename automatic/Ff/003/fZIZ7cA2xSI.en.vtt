00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.670
 you're here hello everyone I'm 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.349
 for already three and well I'm here with the 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.690
 third episode the road to background 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.790
 as you already know a series that consists of 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.270
 explain step by step how to make a 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.670
 background and well those in the previous 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.020
 chapters we do it and we say this from 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.359
 here what you see huarte in the end 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.920
 guards the composition and well today 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.539
 let's put a few effects for 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.650
 the sides so there is a little more 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:34.559
 full and nothing in the next chapter already 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.420
 we will do color correction I am going to see 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.670
 see what I do good I have taken here 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.590
 a few things that the first ones 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.340
 caught that I'm going to put everything first 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.680
 let's put this right as you see the 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.850
 The ball is green and as I told you, it 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.340
 do has to be all the background 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.160
 the same color because because if it does not occupy 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.160
 takes up a lot of space well so 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.020
 what I'm going to do is put a filter 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.260
 of photography 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.730
 and we are going to take the green color and the 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.980
 the density will put one hundred percent 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.440
 and this what it does is that it becomes 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.030
 all the all this green there all this 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.980
 would create colors becomes green 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.720
 and binary we can drag it good 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.210
 we combine the layers first of all by 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.590
 If you have not seen it first, everything is going to 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:22.430
 delete this from here that is advertising and 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.720
 well I'm going to place it under the 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.720
 background I'm going to put 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.329
 I put it under the letters forgiveness and 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.490
 for example I'm going to put what I'm going to do 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:45.110
 smaller with control of 6 that 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:49.780
 can rotate and everything 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.780
 for example I'm going to make it something 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.060
 I'm going to erase this 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.820
 if a little bit and on the other side I'm going to do 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.920
 the same 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:06.150
 we duplicate layer we rotate it 180 degrees 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.390
 so for example 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.910
 but why do not I stay I'm going to do 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:14.030
 something like that 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.040
 a little more for inside is worth more or 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.260
 less well this layer and now we can 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.170
 we can remove it from here now 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.150
 let's take this is how you see 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.750
 if we put image adjustments tone 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.540
 saturation 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.850
 we can change the color to make it 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.610
 a green like that more or less 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.950
 we take 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.180
 selection tool and let's take 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.360
 this piece of here that is what we 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.360
 interest 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.739
 I close this and it does not interest me and the 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:45.230
 same overexposure layer option 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:48.519
 linear so that no black does not look and 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.519
 let's put it for example 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.000
 we can put 2 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.280
 one here 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:05.750
 the opacity went down a little bit if 70 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.320
 is fine and then I put another 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.320
 turned 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.970
 here father 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.400
 we would have this and now we are going to take 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.650
 broken glass 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.349
 how well I'm going to drag it and this 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.720
 I will put above the text because 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:25.629
 you will see that afterwards there will be an effect 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.130
 very handsome with the color correction with the 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:31.550
 crystal is like this 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.130
 I'll put for example like this a little and 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.550
 on the other side 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:37.310
 I also turn it a hundred 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.440
 two 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:43.020
 and I put it more or less to my liking 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.840
 and I'm going to put this crystal also that 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.800
 is in another type if you do not know where 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.800
 find crystal 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:55.930
 well 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:57.820
 there is in the boss x crack pack if I do not 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.860
 I 'm wrong that he's a Spanish boss but if 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:03.130
 I 'm not wrong I plan to make another 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.480
 gpx for something do not worry and nothing and 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.030
 finally I'm going to put these bubbles 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.380
 that also look great and also what 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.080
 I will put above the text I will 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.600
 put reserve linear exhibition what 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.950
 I put like that more or less 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.459
 and we are going to erase 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.000
 the 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:23.000
 both so that it does not look bad 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
 perfect 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.449
 once this is done we are going to make a 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.819
 effect that looks great we're going to go 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:34.390
 to the last layer on top of all 

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:36.700
 without counting the module that is here 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:39.420
 and we're going to create a new layer and what 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.420
 I will do is 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:46.639
 make a line here with the pen 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:50.150
 here and here for example and I'm going to 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:52.069
 good to finish the line like this and we do 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.020
 do right click selection do 

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:57.210
 selection now we take the brush 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:01.080
 we do 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:05.509
 not so big, it's worth it and we choose the 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.509
 white color and click here 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:13.290
 in this brush that is the one that is 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:16.110
 so the edge does not end like this on the side 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:19.500
 I'm going to put investing selection you have 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.320
 than doing it on this side and we're going to 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:25.280
 give him 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:30.050
 the brush here we press control and we 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:32.389
 come on let's not press him 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.430
 the control enzyme that is the biggest 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:36.800
 to capitalize and click at the end 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.509
 you see if there is a line like this now 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.940
 we can draw the selection was going to be 

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:41.740
 this way 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:45.090
 I'm not going to make it a little bigger because 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.090
 they have finished quite well 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:50.320
 so for example 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.930
 and I 'm going to lower the opacity 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.240
 so it's like a line that the 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:58.840
 truth is that it is very good if not 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.700
 you know how to do it also there are there 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:05.710
 good textures images that make it 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:07.090
 just this and well for today I think that 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.550
 we have all the effects the only thing that 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:14.190
 let's do is catch another light 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:16.930
 another flash than those we used yesterday and 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:19.509
 I did it yesterday but 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:23.490
 the pixel episode 1 I think it's yes 

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:23.490
 We were going to put one on each side 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:32.060
 well more or less so for that to the with 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.560
 the sides if you do not know what to put in the 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:36.440
 sides we could also put by 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:39.729
 example and I use to put also 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.729
 a lot of stars 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:45.120
 with little in low light that are these 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:48.169
 here 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:53.639
 we put them down everything 

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:55.620
 the last layer and we take the color 

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:59.960
 thus removing the color or if not 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:59.960
 we can put a little green tone like that 

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:08.370
 I'm going to get all the color 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:11.150
 and we put it in linear overexposure and 

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:13.470
 we lower the opacity 

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:17.160
 so there's a bit of 

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:19.590
 of lights for the background is worth 

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.420
 nothing this has been all in the following 

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:23.070
 episode you will see how all this of the 

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.630
 bubbles and that's going to look great with 

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:27.360
 the correct color in which is the only thing that 

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:29.250
 is and nothing I hope you liked 

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:32.990
 to give him here in favorites and we 

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:32.990
 we see in the next goodbye
