of this subject if your battery

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.140 
of this subject if your battery
terminals<00:01:22.350> are<00:01:22.439> dirty<00:01:22.610> use<00:01:23.610> some<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.090> this

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
terminals are dirty use some of this

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.160 
terminals are dirty use some of this
stuff<00:01:24.619> works<00:01:25.619> miracles<00:01:26.630> I'm<00:01:27.630> not<00:01:27.960> really

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
stuff works miracles I'm not really

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.569 
stuff works miracles I'm not really
going<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.470> spray<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:29.040> on<00:01:29.220> there<00:01:29.430> because

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
going to spray to this on there because

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.539 
going to spray to this on there because
mine<00:01:30.030> aren't<00:01:30.210> dirty<00:01:30.770> but<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.890> foams<00:01:32.130> up<00:01:32.400> and

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
mine aren't dirty but it foams up and

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.840 
mine aren't dirty but it foams up and
turns<00:01:32.729> nice<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.000> yellow<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:34.320> turns<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.979> turns

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
turns nice and yellow it turns a turns

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.609 
turns nice and yellow it turns a turns
yellow<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.600> yellow<00:01:36.630> foam<00:01:37.110> will<00:01:37.320> actually

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
yellow the yellow foam will actually

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.010 
yellow the yellow foam will actually
turn<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:38.040> pink<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.640> when<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.479> contacts<00:01:39.900> the

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
turn to pink and when it contacts the

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.490 
turn to pink and when it contacts the
acid<00:01:40.500> but<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:41.250> know<00:01:41.369> what<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.880> hey<00:01:42.350> and<00:01:43.350> we're

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
acid but you know what the hey and we're

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.630 
acid but you know what the hey and we're
going<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.710> use<00:01:43.860> some<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.100> this<00:01:44.250> battery

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
going to use some of this battery

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.450 
going to use some of this battery
terminal<00:01:45.030> protector<00:01:45.540> prevents<00:01:46.200> corrosion

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
terminal protector prevents corrosion

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.190 
terminal protector prevents corrosion
and<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.729> does<00:01:47.909> prolongs<00:01:48.659> battery<00:01:49.020> life

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
and it does prolongs battery life

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.810 
and it does prolongs battery life
because<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.829> actually<00:01:49.979> keeps<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.399> connection

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
because it actually keeps the connection

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.460 
because it actually keeps the connection
and<00:01:50.909> keeps<00:01:51.060> from<00:01:51.240> your<00:01:51.869> alternator<00:01:52.200> from

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
and keeps from your alternator from

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.719 
and keeps from your alternator from
doing<00:01:52.649> crazy<00:01:52.829> stuff<00:01:53.009> over<00:01:53.369> charging<00:01:53.670> a

doing crazy stuff over charging a

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.789 
doing crazy stuff over charging a
battery<00:01:53.759> so<00:01:54.210> pick<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.720> up<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.899> camp<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.350> know

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
battery so pick you up a camp I know

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.620
