00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 straight phones are totally boring or 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.960
 anyway not heads phones produce lg 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.139
 meanwhile brings the second 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.670
 generation of flex out and we 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:19.020
 of course we have to look now 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:20.939
 more precisely the ltt 62 is like the name 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.600
 already says the second variant or the 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.640
 second generation of the born 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.640
 smartphones from home lg the first 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.470
 generation had such a small one there 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.989
 problems with the hardware not only that 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.820
 is a rest hd display had it was 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.399
 also a bit bigger with 6 inches 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.010
 It had the camera that was 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.890
 based on one from lg 3 take over 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.960
 He does not have any work done by ltc 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.110
 optical image stabilizer from these 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.739
 learned all the mistakes and sent us 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.280
 now here and that deep was two ins 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.059
 run 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.680
 it is only 55 inches tall and even 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.420
 Just like I said hold with one 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.300
 full hd display then in hand too 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.770
 equipped and what else to say 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.960
 it may be the 810 ticks in here mhz 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.939
 qualcomm snapdragon will be here unfortunately 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.930
 not allowed here a benchmark on it 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.880
 to run 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.049
 but one has already said yes 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.790
 American side, we have 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.810
 tested this is not a final 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.850
 sample it is also an engineering 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.320
 sample therefore will also be one 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.880
 a little bit screwed on until just that 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.680
 stop completely then always our running 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.150
 pattern our test pattern we expect 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.710
 that actually one week after 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.970
 the mbc and then you will of course 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.680
 detailed test report about it 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.200
 Report how powerful that I am 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.500
 soon is otherwise the cornerstones of 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.060
 there is a flex 24 in it 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.189
 3 10 megapixel camera with one 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.409
 optical image stabilizer just like you 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.950
 in the house from the g3 in the woods knows 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:50.159
 laser autofocus dual led and natural 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.860
 meanwhile lg signature feature 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.780
 actually the riaa teams the central 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.040
 others from button and the volume level 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.350
 then you go rock 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.960
 placed below then has here as well 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.310
 Rear speakers still grill and if 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.620
 you wonder why they are all in the 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.330
 piano lacquer is that is a self 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.490
 healing coating that is meanwhile the 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.430
 second generation of e-voting 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.900
 it heals itself 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.730
 minimal scratches become very much 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.070
 faster then disappear in the forest and 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.820
 again makes almost the same optics 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.080
 come back 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.300
 Of course it has the disadvantage that it 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.590
 once very fingerprint magnetic 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.360
 don and yes what can you say 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.280
 of course, not too aware now 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.320
 with a key or knife just 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.459
 go and then on it pixeln and 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.250
 then describe on the left 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.050
 for this is not schutting content 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.580
 thought it should really only everyday 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.090
 then damage more or less the 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.580
 content healing to a display I have 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.680
 said front camera is also still in it 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.209
 we blend a water content for one 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.290
 resolution remain just did because I 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.620
 currently not free from the head 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.420
 and of course also here the 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.700
 Infrared sensor here, too 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.500
 is installed on the software side of course 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.019
 android lollipop with it and there are 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.560
 yes still a few nice features of lg 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.600
 built-in 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.190
 You do not really want to go sometimes 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.970
 do not turn on the phone completely 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.160
 you have one here 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.780
 if it was a short time to go through the 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.310
 To look at the time then you can do that 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.930
 through a slight down 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.570
 you have to be slower 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.760
 go down then you can short the times 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.500
 time considering what day it is 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.420
 and how to receive network 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.040
 otherwise, of course, still good and so 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.090
 and so on, everything else 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.570
 available 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.010
 So that's the ltg flexit 2 that was 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.290
 our first impression of our first 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:35.230
 hands and more we can do you right now 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.360
 From this device will not show it will turn off 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.640
 march will be available and in march if we 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.230
 also our test device get then 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.050
 we can tell you in detail how 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:47.440
 is powerful and how much 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.900
 yes, i'll say it's educational 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.690
 endures that's synonymous in the name in it 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.459
 You can get up to 100 kilos actually 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.670
 we will naturally be on it 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:59.140
 try in our test and for what 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.720
 who will find this test of course 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.520
 of course on our website 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.010
 buffed.de people in our social 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.650
 networks such as facebook 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.880
 google + and twitter my name already we 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.370
 See you soon again 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:19.630
 from the mbc on the youtube channel 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:20.859
 Selling 2015 and I expect it for you 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.200
 place and reports live 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.000
 everywhere current gadgets tablets like 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.500
 apples smartphones the companies here 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.600
 So, just have a look at ours 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.250
 topic on powers and otherwise 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.810
 Of course you can find here in this 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.560
 channel all current videos we for 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.560
 collect you here
