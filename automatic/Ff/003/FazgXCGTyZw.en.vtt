00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.050 
episode of the spotlights now today I

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.380 
episode of the spotlights now today I
figured<00:00:18.260> I'd<00:00:18.590> look<00:00:18.710> at<00:00:18.800> a<00:00:18.830> mod<00:00:19.039> pack<00:00:19.310> which<00:00:19.820> is

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
figured I'd look at a mod pack which is

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.210 
figured I'd look at a mod pack which is
something<00:00:20.570> I<00:00:20.750> don't<00:00:20.810> do<00:00:21.080> that<00:00:21.500> much<00:00:21.680> of<00:00:21.890> and<00:00:22.190> I

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
something I don't do that much of and I

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.250 
something I don't do that much of and I
figured<00:00:22.550> rather<00:00:23.449> than<00:00:23.600> just<00:00:23.779> showing<00:00:23.810> ships

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:24.260 
figured rather than just showing ships

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.170 
figured rather than just showing ships
off<00:00:24.500> constantly<00:00:24.859> constantly<00:00:25.340> constantly<00:00:25.609> and

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
off constantly constantly constantly and

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.519 
off constantly constantly constantly and
throwing<00:00:26.480> them<00:00:26.600> out<00:00:26.720> and<00:00:26.779> at<00:00:27.019> the<00:00:27.050> moment<00:00:27.410> the

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529 
throwing them out and at the moment the

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:28.990 
throwing them out and at the moment the
workshop<00:00:27.949> isn't<00:00:28.189> very<00:00:28.340> good<00:00:28.400> for<00:00:28.580> ships<00:00:28.880> at

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
workshop isn't very good for ships at

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.080 
workshop isn't very good for ships at
the<00:00:29.029> moment<00:00:30.369> what<00:00:31.369> I'm<00:00:31.490> gonna<00:00:31.699> do<00:00:31.939> is<00:00:32.059> just

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
the moment what I'm gonna do is just

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.729 
the moment what I'm gonna do is just
show<00:00:32.390> off<00:00:32.509> a<00:00:32.599> few<00:00:32.809> the<00:00:32.989> mods<00:00:33.199> that<00:00:33.319> are<00:00:33.469> being

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
show off a few the mods that are being

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.329 
show off a few the mods that are being
created<00:00:34.249> for<00:00:34.460> the<00:00:34.519> game<00:00:34.760> and<00:00:35.229> one<00:00:36.229> of<00:00:36.350> those<00:00:36.559> in

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:37.339 
created for the game and one of those in

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:39.250 
created for the game and one of those in
particular<00:00:37.550> what<00:00:38.210> I'm<00:00:38.329> looking<00:00:38.629> at<00:00:38.719> is<00:00:38.870> a<00:00:39.109> bit

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
particular what I'm looking at is a bit

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.049 
particular what I'm looking at is a bit
like<00:00:39.350> the<00:00:39.379> azimuth<00:00:39.829> mod<00:00:40.069> pack<00:00:40.280> was<00:00:40.519> like<00:00:40.879> a

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
like the azimuth mod pack was like a

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:43.360 
like the azimuth mod pack was like a
whole<00:00:41.690> heap<00:00:42.109> ton<00:00:42.350> of<00:00:42.379> blocks<00:00:42.739> added<00:00:43.159> to<00:00:43.249> the

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
whole heap ton of blocks added to the

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.340 
whole heap ton of blocks added to the
game<00:00:43.549> and<00:00:43.789> they<00:00:44.359> have<00:00:44.690> specific<00:00:44.929> functions

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
game and they have specific functions

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.889 
game and they have specific functions
based<00:00:46.010> on<00:00:46.219> you<00:00:46.999> know<00:00:47.030> what<00:00:47.389> they<00:00:47.629> look<00:00:47.870> like

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
based on you know what they look like

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:49.509 
based on you know what they look like
and<00:00:48.229> everything<00:00:48.589> so<00:00:48.799> what<00:00:49.280> I'm<00:00:49.399> actually

00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:49.519 
and everything so what I'm actually

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:51.399 
and everything so what I'm actually
looking<00:00:49.670> at<00:00:49.940> is<00:00:50.059> the<00:00:50.179> shadow<00:00:50.479> flux<00:00:50.870> used

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:51.409 
looking at is the shadow flux used

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:54.279 
looking at is the shadow flux used
mining<00:00:52.010> equipment<00:00:52.249> mod<00:00:52.639> pack<00:00:52.879> and<00:00:53.269> adds<00:00:53.899> all

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289

then<00:01:56.659> we've<00:01:56.899> got<00:01:57.109> the<00:01:57.289> actual<00:01:57.409> wheel<00:01:57.889> or<00:01:58.639> the

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
then we've got the actual wheel or the

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.910 
then we've got the actual wheel or the
wheel<00:01:58.880> sections<00:01:59.359> we<00:01:59.569> have<00:01:59.719> this<00:01:59.899> one<00:02:00.139> which<00:02:00.859> is

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
wheel sections we have this one which is

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.789 
wheel sections we have this one which is
just<00:02:01.189> your<00:02:01.819> bog-standard<00:02:01.999> tire<00:02:02.719> we'd<00:02:03.560> like

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
just your bog-standard tire we'd like

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.889 
just your bog-standard tire we'd like
him<00:02:04.039> weed<00:02:04.429> grips<00:02:04.729> on<00:02:04.880> it<00:02:04.999> for<00:02:05.240> moving<00:02:05.659> through

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
him weed grips on it for moving through

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.160 
him weed grips on it for moving through
dirt<00:02:06.189> and<00:02:07.189> then<00:02:07.310> we<00:02:07.369> have<00:02:07.520> tracks<00:02:07.850> which<00:02:08.270> do

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
dirt and then we have tracks which do

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.440 
dirt and then we have tracks which do
look<00:02:09.379> really<00:02:09.769> really<00:02:10.399> awesome<00:02:10.519> and<00:02:11.269> the<00:02:11.360> way

look really really awesome and the way

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.940 
look really really awesome and the way
these<00:02:11.599> work<00:02:11.810> is<00:02:12.019> you<00:02:12.170> can<00:02:12.319> place<00:02:12.470> tracks<00:02:12.769> on

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
these work is you can place tracks on

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.270 
these work is you can place tracks on
tracks<00:02:13.220> like<00:02:13.519> I've<00:02:13.670> done<00:02:13.819> here

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
tracks like I've done here

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.920 
tracks like I've done here
and<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:15.420> actual<00:02:15.960> graphic<00:02:16.320> sort<00:02:17.040> of<00:02:17.130> weirdly

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
and the actual graphic sort of weirdly

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.810 
and the actual graphic sort of weirdly
blitzer<00:02:18.960> a<00:02:19.080> little<00:02:19.320> bit<00:02:19.470> but<00:02:20.280> then<00:02:20.520> what<00:02:20.700> these

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
blitzer a little bit but then what these

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.160 
blitzer a little bit but then what these
do<00:02:21.060> is<00:02:21.090> you<00:02:21.240> can<00:02:21.360> play<00:02:21.480> some<00:02:21.660> side<00:02:21.840> by<00:02:21.960> side

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
do is you can play some side by side

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.950 
do is you can play some side by side
they're<00:02:22.410> based<00:02:22.560> on<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:22.890> tires<00:02:23.390> so<00:02:24.390> you<00:02:24.840> can

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
they're based on the tires so you can

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.540 
they're based on the tires so you can
place<00:02:25.170> them<00:02:25.380> all<00:02:25.470> together<00:02:25.650> link<00:02:26.070> them<00:02:26.220> up<00:02:26.370> and

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
place them all together link them up and

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.010 
place them all together link them up and
then<00:02:26.700> it<00:02:26.820> makes<00:02:27.000> them<00:02:27.270> look<00:02:27.420> like<00:02:27.630> you<00:02:27.900> know

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
then it makes them look like you know

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.010 
then it makes them look like you know
really<00:02:28.350> nice<00:02:28.530> I'm<00:02:28.920> gonna<00:02:29.310> sure<00:02:29.430> if<00:02:29.520> they<00:02:29.640> turn

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
really nice I'm gonna sure if they turn

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.540 
really nice I'm gonna sure if they turn
but<00:02:31.020> they<00:02:31.470> look<00:02:31.620> really<00:02:31.770> cool<00:02:31.980> either<00:02:32.190> way<00:02:32.430> so

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
but they look really cool either way so

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.949 
but they look really cool either way so
you<00:02:32.760> can<00:02:32.880> put<00:02:33.030> like<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.180> really<00:02:33.480> cool<00:02:33.600> mining

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
you can put like a really cool mining

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.210 
you can put like a really cool mining
ship<00:02:34.200> now

one<00:02:45.600> here<00:02:45.900> which<00:02:46.560> actually<00:02:46.830> gets<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:47.070> bit<00:02:47.220> laggy

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
one here which actually gets a bit laggy

the creators the game but you know they

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.770 
the creators the game but you know they
don't<00:03:34.320> add<00:03:34.620> too<00:03:34.799> much<00:03:34.860> and<00:03:35.330> what<00:03:36.330> creators<00:03:36.690> can

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
don't add too much and what creators can

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.960 
don't add too much and what creators can
do<00:03:36.900> anyway<00:03:37.290> so<00:03:37.430> they're<00:03:38.430> here<00:03:38.640> and<00:03:38.760> I<00:03:38.790> look

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
do anyway so they're here and I look

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.000 
do anyway so they're here and I look
really<00:03:39.180> really<00:03:39.390> nice<00:03:39.510> now<00:03:40.290> we<00:03:40.350> do<00:03:40.590> have<00:03:40.799> things

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
really really nice now we do have things

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.520 
really really nice now we do have things
like<00:03:41.250> this<00:03:41.430> which<00:03:41.670> is<00:03:41.910> a<00:03:41.940> boar<00:03:42.540> makes<00:03:43.350> the

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
like this which is a boar makes the

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.900 
like this which is a boar makes the
small<00:03:43.920> boar<00:03:44.190> I<00:03:44.430> believe<00:03:45.799> where<00:03:46.799> is<00:03:46.920> it<00:03:47.070> yes<00:03:47.760> we

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
small boar I believe where is it yes we

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.630 
small boar I believe where is it yes we
got<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.180> SF<00:03:48.930> tunnel<00:03:49.260> board<00:03:49.440> drill<00:03:49.829> and<00:03:50.489> then

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
got the SF tunnel board drill and then

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.120 
got the SF tunnel board drill and then
we've<00:03:50.730> got<00:03:50.850> the<00:03:51.000> SF<00:03:51.360> tunnel<00:03:51.720> borer<00:03:51.989> and<00:03:52.260> this

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
we've got the SF tunnel borer and this

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.819 
we've got the SF tunnel borer and this
is<00:03:53.310> the<00:03:53.459> tunnel<00:03:53.640> bore<00:03:53.940> and<00:03:54.239> it's<00:03:54.470> friggin<00:03:55.470> huge

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
is the tunnel bore and it's friggin huge

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.880 
is the tunnel bore and it's friggin huge
and<00:03:56.630> I'm<00:03:57.630> still<00:03:57.930> unsure<00:03:58.049> how<00:03:58.320> it<00:03:58.380> works<00:03:58.560> but<00:03:58.799> it

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
and I'm still unsure how it works but it

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.530 
and I'm still unsure how it works but it
comes<00:03:59.040> in<00:03:59.190> two<00:03:59.370> parts<00:04:00.140> so<00:04:01.140> I<00:04:01.880> think<00:04:02.880> it<00:04:03.360> works

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
comes in two parts so I think it works

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.140 
comes in two parts so I think it works
like<00:04:03.750> a<00:04:03.780> rotor<00:04:04.110> but

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
like a rotor but

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.600 
like a rotor but
I'm<00:04:06.629> not<00:04:06.840> sure<00:04:07.140> let's<00:04:08.010> just<00:04:08.220> try<00:04:08.400> and<00:04:08.459> figure

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
I'm not sure let's just try and figure

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.860 
I'm not sure let's just try and figure
this<00:04:08.790> out<00:04:09.290> so<00:04:10.290> can<00:04:10.650> i<00:04:10.680> play<00:04:10.709> something<00:04:11.870> inside

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
this out so can i play something inside

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.229 
this out so can i play something inside
of<00:04:13.049> it<00:04:13.170> maybe<00:04:14.269> no<00:04:15.269> I<00:04:16.160> can't<00:04:17.160> go<00:04:17.280> inside<00:04:17.400> either

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
of it maybe no I can't go inside either

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:19.759 
of it maybe no I can't go inside either
just<00:04:18.840> really<00:04:18.959> they<00:04:19.139> want<00:04:19.290> to<00:04:19.380> try<00:04:19.530> and<00:04:19.620> figure

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
just really they want to try and figure

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.740 
just really they want to try and figure
out<00:04:19.979> sort<00:04:20.579> of<00:04:20.669> what<00:04:21.000> you<00:04:21.180> actually<00:04:21.329> do<00:04:21.630> with

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
out sort of what you actually do with

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.230 
out sort of what you actually do with
this<00:04:22.220> get<00:04:23.220> it<00:04:23.370> going<00:04:23.639> but<00:04:23.790> it<00:04:23.910> kind<00:04:24.150> of<00:04:24.180> just

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
this get it going but it kind of just

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.909 
this get it going but it kind of just
sits<00:04:24.510> there<00:04:24.660> at<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:25.080> moment<00:04:25.229> and<00:04:25.650> I'm<00:04:25.770> unsure

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
sits there at the moment and I'm unsure

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:29.240 
sits there at the moment and I'm unsure
how<00:04:26.490> that<00:04:26.760> would<00:04:26.880> work<00:04:27.080> but<00:04:28.080> either<00:04:28.979> way<00:04:29.160> it

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
how that would work but either way it

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.980 
how that would work but either way it
looks<00:04:29.280> cool<00:04:29.669> and<00:04:29.850> again<00:04:30.389> it<00:04:30.479> just<00:04:30.660> come<00:04:30.780> in<00:04:30.870> two

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
looks cool and again it just come in two

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.439 
looks cool and again it just come in two
parts<00:04:31.370> you<00:04:32.370> got<00:04:32.520> the<00:04:32.610> bottom<00:04:32.850> section<00:04:33.000> here<00:04:33.360> in

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
parts you got the bottom section here in

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:34.909 
parts you got the bottom section here in
the<00:04:33.540> top<00:04:33.750> section<00:04:33.960> which<00:04:34.290> is<00:04:34.410> quite<00:04:34.620> hard<00:04:34.830> to

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
the top section which is quite hard to

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:36.110 
the top section which is quite hard to
believe<00:04:35.340> but<00:04:35.550> there<00:04:35.669> you<00:04:35.760> go

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
believe but there you go

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.290 
believe but there you go
so<00:04:36.810> I<00:04:36.840> think<00:04:37.050> yeah<00:04:37.740> so<00:04:37.770> I<00:04:38.100> think<00:04:38.520> is<00:04:38.729> like<00:04:39.150> that

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
so I think yeah so I think is like that

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.629 
so I think yeah so I think is like that
top<00:04:39.510> off<00:04:39.690> is<00:04:39.870> important<00:04:40.350> for<00:04:40.530> something<00:04:40.710> and<00:04:41.520> I

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
top off is important for something and I

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:44.150 
top off is important for something and I
think<00:04:41.729> it<00:04:42.030> does<00:04:42.150> work<00:04:42.180> like<00:04:42.510> a<00:04:42.539> rotor<00:04:43.130> or<00:04:44.130> a

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
think it does work like a rotor or a

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.420 
think it does work like a rotor or a
drill<00:04:44.490> I<00:04:44.639> don't<00:04:44.910> know<00:04:45.169> so<00:04:46.169> we'll<00:04:47.039> get<00:04:47.160> rid<00:04:47.280> of

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
drill I don't know so we'll get rid of

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.279 
drill I don't know so we'll get rid of
that<00:04:47.520> for<00:04:47.699> now<00:04:47.850> just<00:04:48.210> throw<00:04:48.840> it<00:04:48.960> out<00:04:49.050> the<00:04:49.139> way

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:49.289 
that for now just throw it out the way

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.430 
that for now just throw it out the way
nice<00:04:50.100> new<00:04:50.310> one<00:04:50.400> down

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
nice new one down

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.730 
nice new one down
yeah<00:04:52.440> oh<00:04:52.760> sweet<00:04:53.760> Jesus<00:04:54.120> so<00:04:55.020> those<00:04:55.440> are<00:04:55.590> those

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
yeah oh sweet Jesus so those are those

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.159 
yeah oh sweet Jesus so those are those
then<00:04:56.550> with<00:04:56.729> these<00:04:56.940> blocks<00:04:57.479> here<00:04:57.810> we<00:04:58.050> actually

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
then with these blocks here we actually

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:03.770 
then with these blocks here we actually
have<00:04:59.240> conveyors<00:05:00.240> this<00:05:00.510> is<00:05:00.660> a<00:05:00.949> drop<00:05:01.949> I<00:05:02.780> believe

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
have conveyors this is a drop I believe

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.360 
have conveyors this is a drop I believe
you've<00:05:04.199> got<00:05:04.410> a<00:05:04.440> collector<00:05:04.860> here<00:05:05.039> so<00:05:05.190> that's

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
you've got a collector here so that's

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.070 
you've got a collector here so that's
space<00:05:05.699> key<00:05:05.940> it's<00:05:06.210> like<00:05:06.330> a<00:05:06.360> hopper<00:05:06.630> looking

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
space key it's like a hopper looking

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.990 
space key it's like a hopper looking
thing<00:05:07.289> you'll<00:05:07.979> collect<00:05:08.250> all<00:05:08.490> the<00:05:08.580> parts<00:05:08.880> at

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
thing you'll collect all the parts at

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.600 
thing you'll collect all the parts at
four<00:05:09.180> yeah<00:05:09.300> it<00:05:09.360> looks<00:05:09.510> really<00:05:09.780> really<00:05:10.050> nice

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
four yeah it looks really really nice

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.490 
four yeah it looks really really nice
you've<00:05:11.610> got<00:05:11.760> some<00:05:11.940> conveyors<00:05:12.419> here<00:05:12.690> I<00:05:13.050> believe

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
you've got some conveyors here I believe

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.570 
you've got some conveyors here I believe
these<00:05:13.740> are<00:05:14.510> conveyors<00:05:15.979> yes<00:05:16.979> we've<00:05:17.160> got<00:05:17.280> again

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
these are conveyors yes we've got again

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.629 
these are conveyors yes we've got again
belt<00:05:17.910> end<00:05:18.240> belt<00:05:18.660> start<00:05:19.370> and<00:05:20.370> then<00:05:20.460> you<00:05:20.520> got<00:05:20.610> a

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 
belt end belt start and then you got a

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:24.140 
belt end belt start and then you got a
45-degree<00:05:21.570> angle<00:05:21.599> one<00:05:22.310> which<00:05:23.310> is<00:05:23.580> designed<00:05:23.940> to

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
45-degree angle one which is designed to

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.930 
45-degree angle one which is designed to
hook<00:05:24.630> up<00:05:24.840> I<00:05:25.110> believe<00:05:25.560> somewhere<00:05:26.039> and<00:05:26.310> then

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
hook up I believe somewhere and then

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.300 
hook up I believe somewhere and then
they<00:05:27.210> actually<00:05:27.539> need<00:05:27.720> these<00:05:28.080> to<00:05:28.440> work<00:05:28.620> these

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
they actually need these to work these

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.360 
they actually need these to work these
are<00:05:29.370> these<00:05:29.880> belt<00:05:30.180> drives<00:05:30.510> to<00:05:31.349> work<00:05:31.560> going<00:05:32.130> up<00:05:32.280> a

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
are these belt drives to work going up a

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.040 
are these belt drives to work going up a
45<00:05:32.820> degree<00:05:32.940> angle<00:05:33.120> which<00:05:33.450> is<00:05:33.539> kind<00:05:33.780> of<00:05:33.840> cool

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
45 degree angle which is kind of cool

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.650 
45 degree angle which is kind of cool
and<00:05:34.860> we<00:05:34.949> do<00:05:35.070> have<00:05:35.280> these<00:05:35.639> box<00:05:35.970> here<00:05:36.180> which<00:05:36.419> are

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
and we do have these box here which are

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.120 
and we do have these box here which are
just<00:05:37.669> like<00:05:38.669> a<00:05:38.960> giant<00:05:39.960> separators<00:05:40.800> sort<00:05:41.070> of

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
just like a giant separators sort of

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:42.710 
just like a giant separators sort of
things<00:05:41.250> and<00:05:41.400> easy<00:05:41.550> extend<00:05:42.000> out<00:05:42.180> this<00:05:42.389> drill

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 
things and easy extend out this drill

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:46.779 
things and easy extend out this drill
head<00:05:42.930> which<00:05:43.919> does<00:05:44.280> I<00:05:44.550> believe<00:05:44.610> spin<00:05:45.449> so<00:05:45.960> if<00:05:46.050> we

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:46.789 
head which does I believe spin so if we

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:52.439 
head which does I believe spin so if we
okay<00:05:47.789> on

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:52.449 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:54.300 

I<00:05:52.479> believe<00:05:53.169> it<00:05:53.289> works<00:05:53.469> what<00:05:53.800> I<00:05:53.830> do<00:05:53.979> is<00:05:54.099> get

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
I believe it works what I do is get

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.330 
I believe it works what I do is get
popped<00:05:54.610> bet<00:05:54.879> place<00:05:55.210> it<00:05:55.419> down

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
popped bet place it down

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:00.679 
popped bet place it down
jump<00:05:57.340> in<00:05:57.610> so<00:05:58.120> it<00:05:58.240> does<00:05:58.530> and<00:05:59.530> weapons<00:06:00.280> and<00:06:00.400> tools

00:06:00.679 --> 00:06:00.689 
jump in so it does and weapons and tools

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:05.399 
jump in so it does and weapons and tools
and<00:06:01.689> turn<00:06:01.960> that<00:06:02.080> on<00:06:03.360> but<00:06:04.360> of<00:06:04.509> course<00:06:04.719> we<00:06:04.960> has<00:06:05.139> no

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:05.409 
and turn that on but of course we has no

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:07.439 
and turn that on but of course we has no
power<00:06:05.710> so<00:06:06.639> that<00:06:06.909> would<00:06:07.000> be<00:06:07.120> good<00:06:07.210> if<00:06:07.360> I<00:06:07.419> have

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:07.449 
power so that would be good if I have

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:10.770 
power so that would be good if I have
power<00:06:07.810> it<00:06:08.050> wouldn't<00:06:08.379> it<00:06:09.000> there<00:06:10.000> you<00:06:10.060> go<00:06:10.210> that's

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:10.780 
power it wouldn't it there you go that's

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:11.909 
power it wouldn't it there you go that's
what<00:06:10.930> it<00:06:11.020> looks<00:06:11.139> like<00:06:11.229> spinning

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:11.919 
what it looks like spinning

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:15.600 
what it looks like spinning
she's<00:06:12.729> quite<00:06:12.939> not<00:06:13.300> Wow<00:06:13.949> very<00:06:14.949> entrancing

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:15.610 
she's quite not Wow very entrancing

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:17.100 
she's quite not Wow very entrancing
actually<00:06:16.060> and<00:06:16.330> that<00:06:16.629> would<00:06:16.719> probably<00:06:16.870> be<00:06:17.020> a

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
actually and that would probably be a

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.619 
actually and that would probably be a
very<00:06:17.319> effective<00:06:17.500> drill<00:06:17.919> as<00:06:18.099> well<00:06:18.280> I<00:06:18.629> could

00:06:19.619 --> 00:06:19.629 
very effective drill as well I could

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:22.050 
very effective drill as well I could
just<00:06:19.840> picture<00:06:20.110> those<00:06:20.439> sort<00:06:20.830> of<00:06:21.060> munching

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060 
just picture those sort of munching

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.969 
just picture those sort of munching
through<00:06:22.330> the<00:06:22.479> earth<00:06:22.740> you<00:06:23.740> know<00:06:23.800> like

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:23.979 
through the earth you know like

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:25.559 
through the earth you know like
adjoining<00:06:24.280> snared<00:06:24.699> armed<00:06:24.849> with<00:06:25.120> conveyors

00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:25.569 
adjoining snared armed with conveyors

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:27.420 
adjoining snared armed with conveyors
moving<00:06:25.960> everything<00:06:26.590> along<00:06:26.919> we<00:06:27.129> were<00:06:27.250> really

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:27.430 
moving everything along we were really

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:28.740 
moving everything along we were really
really<00:06:27.610> cool<00:06:27.789> to<00:06:27.939> build<00:06:28.060> some<00:06:28.270> really<00:06:28.479> nice

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:28.750 
really cool to build some really nice

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.290 
really cool to build some really nice
ships<00:06:29.259> in<00:06:29.439> it<00:06:29.560> but<00:06:30.340> I'm<00:06:30.490> just<00:06:30.669> here<00:06:30.849> to<00:06:31.000> show<00:06:31.029> it

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:31.300 
ships in it but I'm just here to show it

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.469 
ships in it but I'm just here to show it
off<00:06:31.449> so<00:06:32.289> that<00:06:33.250> is<00:06:33.430> a<00:06:33.460> lot<00:06:33.879> of<00:06:33.939> the<00:06:34.000> block<00:06:34.270> so

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:34.479 
off so that is a lot of the block so

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:35.879 
off so that is a lot of the block so
I'll<00:06:34.539> show<00:06:34.779> you<00:06:34.840> where<00:06:35.020> it<00:06:35.139> is<00:06:35.229> in<00:06:35.349> here<00:06:35.590> it's

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:35.889 
I'll show you where it is in here it's

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:37.800 
I'll show you where it is in here it's
called<00:06:36.069> the<00:06:36.189> SF<00:06:36.400> mining<00:06:36.789> mod<00:06:37.330> pack<00:06:37.569> whatever

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:37.810 
called the SF mining mod pack whatever

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.920 
called the SF mining mod pack whatever
and<00:06:38.529> these<00:06:38.650> are<00:06:38.800> all<00:06:38.860> the<00:06:38.949> blocks<00:06:39.129> should<00:06:39.310> get

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:39.930 
and these are all the blocks should get

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.110 
and these are all the blocks should get
again<00:06:40.930> this<00:06:41.050> is<00:06:41.229> the<00:06:41.379> belt<00:06:41.770> motor<00:06:42.069> so<00:06:42.879> that<00:06:42.909> is

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 
again this is the belt motor so that is

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.550 
again this is the belt motor so that is
got<00:06:43.419> it<00:06:43.569> that's<00:06:43.750> got<00:06:43.840> to<00:06:43.960> hook<00:06:44.020> up<00:06:44.169> to<00:06:44.199> anything

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.560 
got it that's got to hook up to anything

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.159 
got it that's got to hook up to anything
with<00:06:44.800> a<00:06:44.860> 45<00:06:45.250> degree<00:06:45.370> angle<00:06:45.550> on<00:06:45.969> and<00:06:46.210> there<00:06:47.139> is

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:47.169 
with a 45 degree angle on and there is

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:49.589 
with a 45 degree angle on and there is
this<00:06:48.039> one<00:06:48.250> as<00:06:48.370> well<00:06:48.580> which<00:06:48.849> is<00:06:48.879> the<00:06:49.210> belt<00:06:49.389> and

00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:49.599 
this one as well which is the belt and

00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:52.290 
this one as well which is the belt and
I'm<00:06:50.409> not<00:06:50.620> sure<00:06:50.830> what<00:06:51.159> what<00:06:51.550> the<00:06:51.669> difference<00:06:52.060> is

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:52.300 
I'm not sure what what the difference is

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.499 
I'm not sure what what the difference is
with<00:06:53.229> what<00:06:53.379> these<00:06:53.560> do<00:06:53.889> but<00:06:54.279> I<00:06:54.580> believe<00:06:55.330> they're

00:06:55.499 --> 00:06:55.509 
with what these do but I believe they're

00:06:55.509 --> 00:06:59.969 
with what these do but I believe they're
necessary<00:06:56.110> so<00:06:56.819> use<00:06:57.819> them<00:06:58.029> and<00:06:58.319> I<00:06:59.319> think<00:06:59.770> I<00:06:59.830> can

00:06:59.969 --> 00:06:59.979 
necessary so use them and I think I can

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:02.550 
necessary so use them and I think I can
go<00:07:00.099> on<00:07:00.159> top<00:07:00.490> on<00:07:00.789> it<00:07:00.969> yeah<00:07:01.930> there<00:07:02.110> you<00:07:02.169> go

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:02.560 
go on top on it yeah there you go

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.709 
go on top on it yeah there you go
so<00:07:03.009> you<00:07:03.069> can<00:07:03.219> like<00:07:03.370> build<00:07:03.669> them<00:07:03.879> up<00:07:04.000> in<00:07:04.240> in<00:07:04.539> like

00:07:04.709 --> 00:07:04.719 
so you can like build them up in in like

00:07:04.719 --> 00:07:07.499 
so you can like build them up in in like
nice<00:07:05.349> sections<00:07:05.919> so<00:07:06.550> that<00:07:06.580> has<00:07:06.969> been<00:07:07.180> the

00:07:07.499 --> 00:07:07.509 
nice sections so that has been the

00:07:07.509 --> 00:07:10.110 
nice sections so that has been the
shadow<00:07:07.990> hooks<00:07:08.289> huge<00:07:08.860> mining<00:07:09.279> equipment<00:07:09.520> mod<00:07:09.879> I

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:10.120 
shadow hooks huge mining equipment mod I

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.939 
shadow hooks huge mining equipment mod I
really<00:07:10.750> like<00:07:10.870> the<00:07:11.020> look<00:07:11.169> of<00:07:11.319> it<00:07:11.440> and<00:07:11.589> it's<00:07:11.919> very

00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:11.949 
really like the look of it and it's very

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:14.070 
really like the look of it and it's very
different<00:07:12.279> it's<00:07:12.610> unlike<00:07:13.509> making<00:07:13.870> military

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.080 
different it's unlike making military

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.899 
different it's unlike making military
things<00:07:14.469> like<00:07:14.620> weapons<00:07:14.800> and<00:07:15.219> stuff<00:07:15.430> like<00:07:15.669> most

00:07:15.899 --> 00:07:15.909 
things like weapons and stuff like most

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:18.149 
things like weapons and stuff like most
most<00:07:16.330> of<00:07:16.449> the<00:07:16.539> mod<00:07:16.719> creators<00:07:17.080> do<00:07:17.289> he's

00:07:18.149 --> 00:07:18.159 
most of the mod creators do he's

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:19.950 
most of the mod creators do he's
actually<00:07:18.310> made<00:07:18.639> something<00:07:18.909> very<00:07:19.719> specific

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:19.960 
actually made something very specific

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.230 
actually made something very specific
for<00:07:20.440> a<00:07:20.469> very<00:07:20.710> kind<00:07:20.979> of<00:07:21.009> specific<00:07:21.129> you<00:07:21.819> know<00:07:21.879> set

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240 
for a very kind of specific you know set
