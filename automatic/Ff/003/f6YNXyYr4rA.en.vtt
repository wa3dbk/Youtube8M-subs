00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
you're braiding so this is why I call it

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.990 
you're braiding so this is why I call it
the<00:02:09.819> team<00:02:10.030> message<00:02:10.860> now<00:02:11.860> you<00:02:11.920> can<00:02:12.550> start<00:02:12.819> off

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
the team message now you can start off

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.460 
the team message now you can start off
as<00:02:13.209> a<00:02:13.239> twist<00:02:13.600> but<00:02:13.720> I<00:02:13.780> don't<00:02:13.989> like<00:02:14.080> to<00:02:14.170> do<00:02:14.319> that

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
as a twist but I don't like to do that

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.960 
as a twist but I don't like to do that
because<00:02:14.680> it<00:02:15.040> can<00:02:15.130> break<00:02:15.340> off<00:02:15.489> your<00:02:15.730> hair

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
because it can break off your hair

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.729 
because it can break off your hair
especially<00:02:16.300> if<00:02:16.810> you're<00:02:16.959> doing<00:02:17.050> long<00:02:17.410> to<00:02:17.650> us

especially if you're doing long to us

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.110 
especially if you're doing long to us
because<00:02:18.040> all<00:02:18.190> it's<00:02:18.340> doing<00:02:18.400> is<00:02:18.700> it's<00:02:18.940> going<00:02:19.060> to

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
because all it's doing is it's going to

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.699 
because all it's doing is it's going to
keep<00:02:19.239> wrapping<00:02:19.480> itself<00:02:20.020> when<00:02:20.410> you<00:02:20.530> have<00:02:20.680> a

able to twist our hair within the twist

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.250 
able to twist our hair within the twist
so<00:02:42.340> what<00:02:42.459> I<00:02:42.489> mean<00:02:42.700> by<00:02:42.940> that<00:02:42.970> is<00:02:43.690> that<00:02:43.750> you're

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
so what I mean by that is that you're

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.930 
so what I mean by that is that you're
kind<00:02:44.530> of<00:02:44.620> rolling<00:02:44.860> it<00:02:45.130> while<00:02:45.310> you're<00:02:45.430> twisting

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
kind of rolling it while you're twisting

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.370 
kind of rolling it while you're twisting
and<00:02:46.150> it's<00:02:46.269> gonna<00:02:46.450> cause<00:02:46.720> it<00:02:46.900> to<00:02:47.019> stick<00:02:47.319> a

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
and it's gonna cause it to stick a

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.290 
and it's gonna cause it to stick a
little<00:02:47.590> bit<00:02:47.769> more<00:02:48.010> so<00:02:48.519> that<00:02:48.610> your<00:02:48.760> twist<00:02:49.150> can

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
little bit more so that your twist can

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.970 
little bit more so that your twist can
be<00:02:49.390> actually<00:02:49.569> tighter<00:02:50.140> because<00:02:50.620> once<00:02:50.830> you're

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
be actually tighter because once you're

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.560 
be actually tighter because once you're
done<00:02:51.100> twisting<00:02:51.519> is<00:02:51.610> one<00:02:51.760> hour<00:02:51.910> level<00:02:52.390> a<00:02:52.420> little
