00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
something and even use it the

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.830 
something and even use it the
sensitivity<00:03:08.050> is<00:03:08.110> way<00:03:08.410> better<00:03:09.180> than<00:03:10.180> what<00:03:10.810> it

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
sensitivity is way better than what it

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.790 
sensitivity is way better than what it
has<00:03:11.080> ever<00:03:11.350> been

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.680 
you know Apple what have they done I
mean

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
mean

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.190 
mean
I<00:04:21.720> have<00:04:22.019> I<00:04:23.030> have<00:04:24.030> this<00:04:24.180> new<00:04:24.450> I<00:04:24.480> was<00:04:24.720> able<00:04:24.900> to

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
I have I have this new I was able to

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.320 
I have I have this new I was able to
look<00:04:25.530> exactly<00:04:25.710> the<00:04:26.040> same<00:04:26.100> as<00:04:26.610> earlier

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
look exactly the same as earlier

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.470 
look exactly the same as earlier
versions<00:04:27.810> and<00:04:28.710> this<00:04:28.980> one<00:04:29.190> is<00:04:29.310> only<00:04:29.520> mainly

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
versions and this one is only mainly

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.650 
versions and this one is only mainly
it's<00:04:30.840> it's<00:04:31.170> an<00:04:31.380> update<00:04:31.740> for<00:04:32.010> people<00:04:32.580> that<00:04:33.510> will

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
it's it's an update for people that will

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.920 
it's it's an update for people that will
buy<00:04:33.840> the<00:04:33.900> Apple<00:04:34.260> watch<00:04:34.880> so<00:04:35.880> I<00:04:36.330> guess<00:04:36.720> that's

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
buy the Apple watch so I guess that's

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.100 
buy the Apple watch so I guess that's
great<00:04:37.320> in<00:04:37.650> that<00:04:38.280> little<00:04:38.610> way<00:04:38.760> but<00:04:39.060> you<00:04:39.930> know<00:04:40.080> I

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
great in that little way but you know I

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.230 
great in that little way but you know I
think<00:04:40.350> that<00:04:40.590> Apple<00:04:41.040> you<00:04:41.640> know<00:04:41.760> they<00:04:41.940> need<00:04:42.120> to

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
think that Apple you know they need to

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.360 
think that Apple you know they need to
make<00:04:42.390> something<00:04:42.690> exciting<00:04:43.650> again<00:04:45.740> it<00:04:46.740> kind<00:04:47.190> of

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
make something exciting again it kind of

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.310 
make something exciting again it kind of
I'm<00:04:47.820> always<00:04:48.060> going<00:04:48.270> to<00:04:48.330> go<00:04:48.480> to<00:04:48.540> cool<00:04:48.900> device

also comes with touch or not touch ID
but<00:05:27.210> the<00:05:27.240> fingerprint<00:05:27.720> sensor<00:05:27.840> that<00:05:28.140> you<00:05:28.260> do

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
but the fingerprint sensor that you do

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.520 
but the fingerprint sensor that you do
get<00:05:28.590> in<00:05:29.160> the<00:05:29.640> note<00:05:30.000> 4<00:05:30.480> let's<00:05:30.840> go<00:05:31.110> and<00:05:31.380> check

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
get in the note 4 let's go and check

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.409 
get in the note 4 let's go and check
that<00:05:31.560> of<00:05:31.860> course<00:05:32.040> here<00:05:32.400> touch<00:05:32.640> ID<00:05:32.940> which<00:05:33.270> is

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 
that of course here touch ID which is

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:35.450 
that of course here touch ID which is
probably<00:05:33.720> a<00:05:33.810> little<00:05:34.020> bit<00:05:34.260> sharper<00:05:34.770> than<00:05:34.890> then

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
probably a little bit sharper than then

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.900 
probably a little bit sharper than then
overall<00:05:35.970> and<00:05:36.390> then<00:05:36.720> on<00:05:37.050> the<00:05:37.560> you<00:05:38.220> note<00:05:38.400> 4<00:05:38.760> and

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
overall and then on the you note 4 and

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:46.320 
overall and then on the you note 4 and
the<00:05:39.000> note<00:05:39.180> edge

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.890 

I<00:05:47.370> actually<00:05:48.370> do<00:05:48.729> the<00:05:49.120> other<00:05:49.270> with<00:05:49.509> your<00:05:49.599> finger

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900 
I actually do the other with your finger

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.629 
I actually do the other with your finger
scanner<00:05:50.199> and<00:05:50.590> of<00:05:50.800> course<00:05:51.039> then<00:05:51.250> we<00:05:51.280> do<00:05:51.490> have

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:51.639 
scanner and of course then we do have

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:59.390 
scanner and of course then we do have
the<00:05:51.789> same<00:05:52.000> kind<00:05:52.419> of<00:05:52.449> feature<00:05:53.250> inside<00:05:54.250> of<00:05:54.759> the

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.059 

there<00:06:00.400> we<00:06:00.580> go<00:06:00.729> touch<00:06:01.090> ID<00:06:01.800> same<00:06:02.800> kind<00:06:02.979> of

00:06:03.059 --> 00:06:03.069 
there we go touch ID same kind of

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:06.809 
there we go touch ID same kind of
feature<00:06:03.250> inside<00:06:03.849> of<00:06:04.150> the<00:06:04.599> the<00:06:05.139> iPhone<00:06:05.500> so<00:06:06.400> it

00:06:06.809 --> 00:06:06.819 
feature inside of the the iPhone so it

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:08.159 
feature inside of the the iPhone so it
works<00:06:07.030> a<00:06:07.180> little<00:06:07.300> bit<00:06:07.509> different<00:06:07.930> of<00:06:08.139> course

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:08.169 
works a little bit different of course

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:11.670 
works a little bit different of course
on<00:06:08.710> on<00:06:09.190> both<00:06:09.490> these<00:06:09.729> two<00:06:10.000> devices<00:06:10.270> but<00:06:10.780> the

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
on on both these two devices but the

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.040 
on on both these two devices but the
general<00:06:12.099> the<00:06:12.460> overall<00:06:12.789> idea<00:06:13.180> is<00:06:13.479> you<00:06:13.930> know

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.050 
general the overall idea is you know

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.550 
general the overall idea is you know
it's<00:06:14.289> about<00:06:14.470> the<00:06:14.860> same<00:06:15.099> and<00:06:16.139> then<00:06:17.139> we<00:06:17.169> also<00:06:17.379> do

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560 
it's about the same and then we also do

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.719 
it's about the same and then we also do
have<00:06:17.740> this<00:06:17.830> other<00:06:18.039> thing<00:06:18.159> that's<00:06:18.580> a<00:06:18.669> little

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:18.729 
have this other thing that's a little

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:21.439 
have this other thing that's a little
bit<00:06:19.030> boring<00:06:19.680> also<00:06:20.680> die<00:06:20.800> phones<00:06:21.069> is<00:06:21.310> that

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:21.449 
bit boring also die phones is that

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:24.119 
bit boring also die phones is that
you're<00:06:22.449> very<00:06:22.479> locked<00:06:23.139> down<00:06:23.409> like<00:06:23.740> when<00:06:23.949> I

00:06:24.119 --> 00:06:24.129 
you're very locked down like when I

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:26.490 
you're very locked down like when I
connect<00:06:24.490> my<00:06:24.780> Android<00:06:25.780> device<00:06:25.810> here<00:06:26.199> my<00:06:26.319> note
