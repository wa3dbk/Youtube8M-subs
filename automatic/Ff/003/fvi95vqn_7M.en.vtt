roller we sell these at cutting edge
stencils<00:01:47.200> they<00:01:47.470> work<00:01:47.619> great<00:01:47.890> for<00:01:48.160> projects

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
stencils they work great for projects

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.029 
stencils they work great for projects
like<00:01:48.729> this<00:01:49.060> where<00:01:49.330> you<00:01:49.420> have<00:01:49.599> a<00:01:50.110> big<00:01:50.860> enough

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039 
like this where you have a big enough

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:53.490 
like this where you have a big enough
area<00:01:51.220> to<00:01:51.429> roll<00:01:51.819> stuff<00:01:52.810> small<00:01:53.110> enough<00:01:53.349> where

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
area to roll stuff small enough where

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.690 
area to roll stuff small enough where
you<00:01:53.590> really<00:01:53.830> need<00:01:53.860> to<00:01:54.039> get<00:01:54.160> in<00:01:54.280> with<00:01:54.369> a<00:01:54.459> brush

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
you really need to get in with a brush

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.609 
you really need to get in with a brush
it's<00:01:55.300> not<00:01:55.390> that<00:01:55.569> detailed<00:01:55.810> these<00:01:56.500> are

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
it's not that detailed these are

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.449 
it's not that detailed these are
dynamite<00:01:57.069> so<00:01:57.520> what<00:01:57.700> we'll<00:01:57.819> do<00:01:58.000> is<00:01:58.500> we'll<00:01:59.500> load

00:02:00.449 --> 00:02:00.459 
dynamite so what we'll do is we'll load

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:02.490 
dynamite so what we'll do is we'll load
our<00:02:00.819> roller<00:02:01.300> and<00:02:01.660> again<00:02:02.170> this<00:02:02.319> is<00:02:02.440> very

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
our roller and again this is very

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.719 
our roller and again this is very
important<00:02:03.190> evenly<00:02:03.580> roll<00:02:04.000> load<00:02:04.450> your<00:02:04.840> roller

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
important evenly roll load your roller

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.979 
important evenly roll load your roller
we'll<00:02:06.729> just<00:02:06.910> run<00:02:07.060> it<00:02:07.179> through<00:02:07.300> the<00:02:07.450> paint<00:02:07.690> nice

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:07.989 
we'll just run it through the paint nice

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:09.960 
we'll just run it through the paint nice
and<00:02:08.200> even

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
and even

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.090 
and even
get<00:02:10.970> it<00:02:11.090> equally<00:02:11.630> distributed<00:02:12.350> on<00:02:12.530> the

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
get it equally distributed on the

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.310 
get it equally distributed on the
surface<00:02:13.970> of<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:16.430> roller<00:02:16.670> and<00:02:17.150> now<00:02:17.780> what<00:02:18.170> we'll

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
surface of the roller and now what we'll

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.980 
surface of the roller and now what we'll
do<00:02:18.560> is<00:02:18.830> we'll<00:02:19.400> offload<00:02:19.910> it<00:02:20.210> onto<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:20.780> paper

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
do is we'll offload it onto the paper

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.870 
do is we'll offload it onto the paper
towels<00:02:21.380> so<00:02:21.770> you<00:02:22.010> come<00:02:22.280> down<00:02:22.310> to<00:02:22.580> your<00:02:22.670> paper

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
towels so you come down to your paper

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.900 
towels so you come down to your paper
towels<00:02:23.210> and<00:02:23.570> just<00:02:24.140> one<00:02:24.350> or<00:02:24.500> two<00:02:24.560> passes<00:02:24.910> you

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
towels and just one or two passes you

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.510 
towels and just one or two passes you
can<00:02:26.060> see<00:02:26.270> how<00:02:26.420> it<00:02:26.570> offloads<00:02:27.050> it<00:02:27.520> with

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
can see how it offloads it with

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.120 
can see how it offloads it with
different<00:02:29.410> consistency<00:02:30.410> so<00:02:30.680> it<00:02:30.830> gets<00:02:31.070> a

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
different consistency so it gets a

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.650 
different consistency so it gets a
little<00:02:31.310> heavier<00:02:31.550> in<00:02:31.610> some<00:02:31.880> areas<00:02:32.240> so<00:02:32.360> as<00:02:32.390> we

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
little heavier in some areas so as we

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.230 
little heavier in some areas so as we
offload<00:02:33.050> this<00:02:33.230> it<00:02:33.440> evens<00:02:33.830> out<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.670> load<00:02:34.940> on

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
offload this it evens out the load on

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.120 
offload this it evens out the load on
the<00:02:35.300> roller<00:02:35.660> now<00:02:36.290> we<00:02:36.380> have<00:02:36.500> an<00:02:36.590> even<00:02:36.830> load<00:02:36.980> on

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
the roller now we have an even load on

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.620 
the roller now we have an even load on
the<00:02:37.220> roller<00:02:37.400> we're<00:02:37.970> going<00:02:38.090> to<00:02:38.150> come<00:02:38.300> up<00:02:38.330> and
