00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 that your mens floor game is a fun one 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.100
 young people watch this new video 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.049
 go to the shop by a mine and go today 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.620
 I do some muscle work for you Mike 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.620
 the intro 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.440
 well start i was in a lot i hope you 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.120
 also a blue for a long time 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.470
 inside out when you leave this series fat 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.000
 find and then I try to do it often 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.619
 this looks a bit like a dangerous one 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.939
 throw would I think the signs with 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.960
 can break but it doesn't matter because 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.580
 i slept number taking is like it 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.359
 evolutionary point of view it is just like with 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.070
 concerned 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.359
 all in all pretty good at the 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.429
 job went well with me in the piece 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.929
 some more difficult all the time have one 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.399
 checkpoint it says code where you 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.660
 says ok well i am curious service 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.590
 henny it's just a big troll we go 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.670
 the time made but we will 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.050
 the van will make the sense 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.489
 no it is serious to me because I take it 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.780
 that really should be here I hope 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.040
 this one that looks a bit better than the last one 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.690
 namely, it did not return last time 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.489
 I managed to do a speed run 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.140
 pick up food and hope to be there 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.489
 these episode changes 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.110
 finally bring a speed run into it 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.640
 you should try as soon as possible 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.480
 to get from point a to point b without any 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.800
 issues 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.550
 yes you know I see or have the opinion 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.100
 if I didn't cause any problems 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.770
 so I'm going to try to get as soon as possible 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.570
 to get from point a to point b and me 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.230
 hope i get this and i get it 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.760
 very nice 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.899
 I called through this yes I just have to via 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.460
 walk Rotterdam I'll just will 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.320
 probably you have serious none 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.100
 idea that is kees smits so hot this one 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.330
 folder 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.830
 for the rest I actually wanted to leave 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.970
 going to add there is no idea which 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.200
 side must i just follow me there 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.880
 ladders in the ladder they will like me 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.110
 drive to happiness of which it is not like 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.490
 seriously block it to that 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.290
 do not allow me to go to these countries 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.130
 OK then one for Charlie really 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.720
 another whole 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.130
 happened I might wait oh 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.170
 thinks already know probably just should 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.220
 so that's probably because whole junk yes 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.930
 I thought so what will it usually do 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.909
 service for all these villains and idea 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.770
 This circle is the very good taste of 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.720
 Secret Roads Russell Jobs last year 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.979
 stood there is picky in your choice of 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.850
 choose the throw away link 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.229
 between the middle and between the 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.610
 right side, but secretly it was normal 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.600
 behind you and the was actually the 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.619
 easiest way so on the one or 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.060
 other way you should make sure 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.619
 that you are always on your guard 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.060
 when you put in this service stuff up 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.200
 you can use this server quite often for the 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.790
 being fooled I am in everyone 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.020
 case now yannick also all lava and 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.979
 I can go to shit and servers 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.049
 down it is wrong I'm actually taking 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.430
 to not see well then what 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.590
 steel plate is very likely something 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.759
 on that sign of go up or something I have none 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.750
 idea what could stand for very 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.189
 probably who you should try 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.810
 just get the course shared 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.070
 way down and above instead 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.360
 Look, I'm going to name members' music 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.549
 soften no okay that 's apparently 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.930
 not how thick is the grant after that 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.849
 hard to come would say 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.200
 first I have to do this so this job is 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.250
 to do that is nice and then i have to go through 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.510
 this then that 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.220
 we get that right back to troll 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.720
 piece say but you do not via 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.700
 serve that must go and you must be coarse through 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.210
 this to this just go the whole way 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.320
 idea 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.820
 ok we are upstairs and so we have to 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.980
 now then quickly and precisely must go to 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.660
 the right on the net just got here and 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.310
 if good i can put this on you okay pretty 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.990
 so i'm gonna see a zipper checkpoint 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.310
 not very promising from all that portion 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.630
 PC go down and out at once 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.530
 through the lava you go i have t and that 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.370
 pretty hard going to be la go 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.370
 try okay 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.690
 shit i had a channels fuck i think so 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.800
 I oh what I just know even though you hear yes 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.450
 I already know you must first just 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.680
 wait until he comes up and 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.850
 then you have to stop over there 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.070
 I think because I mainly saw and 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:53.350
 sit around a block 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.350
 no pussy this is really hard you 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.440
 oh no this is really hard because they are so 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.030
 you can say that they are close together 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.170
 but that by turbo you go well 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.220
 one too far 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:06.830
 so you really have to be at the right time 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:09.530
 you have to speak on that is now oh oh now 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.670
 no really hard oh my god this is going 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.050
 really long guys i can 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.850
 you really assure all this go around 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:20.120
 piece where we really just still 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:22.400
 a fucking your stuck because 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.660
 first how can i get hit 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.100
 by the let you know which one clearly 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.820
 jump over it 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:33.710
 like what to fuck ok he is coming up now 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:35.330
 and who and who and this must always be 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.350
 want to skip another block and 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.180
 both fast fast fast 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.180
 then we go wrong again ok let's go 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:48.230
 now now now 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.030
 no I wish I could not go through that corner 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.320
 after that to the right that is 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.910
 However, no not found every time 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.410
 I can ruin this now I am the one 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.770
 in the early 80s we each spawn exactly on 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.770
 the last moment 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:06.240
 haha pins it is generous press oja and 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.010
 your nail atoms must have traveled to 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.570
 come here to lesbo checkpoint 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.680
 I think you this is what jour des 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.240
 patience two can just go a bit 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.470
 walk to the every one sees someone block to it 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.150
 block must go because generally 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.260
 of course it's a bit of google's 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.850
 of papers let alone again 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.650
 chelsea you walk a little show 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.750
 patience and kind of open-world feeling 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.160
 gives it so say look don't go 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.230
 that air conditioner left 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.430
 Make a left and look you can 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.060
 Well apparently you have to go this way 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.620
 on the expectations ok and you must 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.640
 so through these disadvantages we don't have a body 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.950
 go go boys, I really do not know 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.120
 others then actually haha okay 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.020
 guys i don't know where i am now as 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.490
 very likely we must go 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.750
 try looking to get as high as possible 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.730
 it goes well guys it goes like this 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.810
 often you well ok the white has to 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.640
 doing this together is really a piece 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.870
 where you want quiet now happy wants 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.220
 usually pieces are not easy that 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.720
 go right though it's only when you 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.190
 say it wants to do quickly this is 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.080
 a read or not year is a door I can 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.980
 more who can do many others i have there 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.330
 fancy the maze 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.650
 no it is apparently not possible and do it 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.480
 it dolf much i have no other 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.530
 apparently ok you can take a look 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.360
 move here 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.100
 yes can drop then oh well now it has to 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.750
 read trick on the high character as 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.980
 really the one that totally can not stand 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.660
 the stupid generation involved 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.220
 I think we are already okay late 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.510
 multiple floors go away with you 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.920
 by about i ever asked for 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:12.270
 mazes no i asked for muscle back 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.740
 not for the deaf to fucking 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.300
 puzzling and by being simply 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.920
 two biggest nightmares in life 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.870
 I would wake up at night I would have 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.670
 the swedoro do have puzzles and pad then 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.960
 four times a night so maya has to be everywhere 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.000
 a first time front is a kind 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.830
 from my minecraft maze speedrun 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.120
 deflowered in that you are going to think 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.200
 what I mean on one side I think too 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.250
 a not that you mean i mean 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.580
 but comes to the idea when it comes to 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.780
 the idea 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.220
 this is really a very annoying goal 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.600
 way through all that's here you know already 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.740
 I really had a single big pot with me 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.360
 the can of course not because my head 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.410
 broken good for there are so many 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.790
 gangjes you really get to be one 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.280
 paranormal of paranormal activity 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:43.320
 fucking minecraft version tersia floor 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.520
 shit i've got this through the race 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.930
 just not really going anywhere 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.760
 this just leads me a really cool way 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.830
 from he you stupid enough to get through
