halogens<00:00:03.810> standing<00:00:04.319> lamp<00:00:04.470> that<00:00:04.890> I<00:00:05.370> think<00:00:05.700> I

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
halogens standing lamp that I think I

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.780 
halogens standing lamp that I think I
showed<00:00:05.970> you<00:00:06.089> before<00:00:06.379> so<00:00:07.379> simply<00:00:08.309> plugs<00:00:08.580> in

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
showed you before so simply plugs in

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.789 
showed you before so simply plugs in
here<00:00:09.710> cable<00:00:10.710> to<00:00:10.920> a<00:00:10.950> dimmer<00:00:11.309> unit<00:00:11.719> to<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:13.230> lamp

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
here cable to a dimmer unit to the lamp

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.550 
here cable to a dimmer unit to the lamp
and<00:00:14.099> at<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.309> top<00:00:14.549> there<00:00:14.820> is<00:00:14.910> a<00:00:15.030> linear<00:00:15.560> halogen

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
and at the top there is a linear halogen

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.689 
and at the top there is a linear halogen
lamp<00:00:16.800> there<00:00:17.609> so<00:00:17.910> it's<00:00:18.029> 230<00:00:18.779> watts<00:00:19.699> produced

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
lamp there so it's 230 watts produced

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.759 
lamp there so it's 230 watts produced
about<00:00:20.939> 5,000<00:00:21.779> lumens<00:00:22.140> of<00:00:22.260> light<00:00:22.320> well<00:00:22.680> I'm

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
about 5,000 lumens of light well I'm

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.990 
about 5,000 lumens of light well I'm
going<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.039> show<00:00:23.220> you<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:24.769> 5-minute<00:00:25.769> mod<00:00:26.430> that

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
going to show you a 5-minute mod that

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.820 
going to show you a 5-minute mod that
you<00:00:27.090> can<00:00:27.269> do<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:27.869> will<00:00:27.990> increase<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.650> light

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
you can do that will increase the light

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.730 
you can do that will increase the light
output<00:00:29.099> by<00:00:29.429> nearly<00:00:29.609> 20%<00:00:30.060> perhaps<00:00:30.779> nearly<00:00:31.349> near

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
output by nearly 20% perhaps nearly near

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.319 
output by nearly 20% perhaps nearly near
a<00:00:31.769> 40%<00:00:32.640> while<00:00:33.630> simultaneously<00:00:35.210> reducing<00:00:36.210> the

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
a 40% while simultaneously reducing the

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.209 
a 40% while simultaneously reducing the
energy<00:00:36.630> consumption<00:00:37.020> by<00:00:37.829> 75%<00:00:39.140> so<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.950> all

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
energy consumption by 75% so it all

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.310 
energy consumption by 75% so it all
comes<00:00:41.460> down<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.910> new<00:00:42.300> lighting<00:00:42.690> technology<00:00:43.170> so

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
comes down to new lighting technology so

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.209 
comes down to new lighting technology so
what<00:00:43.410> I'm<00:00:43.469> gonna<00:00:43.590> do<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.770> I'm<00:00:43.860> going<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.010> swap

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to swap

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.580 
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to swap
out<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.520> light<00:00:44.670> bulb<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.379> for<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.410> more

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
out the light bulb and for a more

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.770 
out the light bulb and for a more
efficient<00:00:46.980> one<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:48.120> lamp<00:00:48.300> I'm<00:00:48.450> going<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.690> be

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
efficient one the lamp I'm going to be

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.310 
efficient one the lamp I'm going to be
using<00:00:48.960> it's<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.910> double-ended<00:00:50.910> 70<00:00:51.870> watt<00:00:52.050> metal

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
using it's a double-ended 70 watt metal

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.160 
using it's a double-ended 70 watt metal
halide<00:00:52.590> lamp<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:54.030> it's<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.239> 118<00:00:54.870> millimeters

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
halide lamp so it's a 118 millimeters

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.889 
halide lamp so it's a 118 millimeters
long<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.949> takes<00:00:56.160> an<00:00:56.340> R<00:00:56.520> 7<00:00:56.820> s<00:00:57.149> fitting<00:00:57.719> which

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
long and it takes an R 7 s fitting which

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.900 
long and it takes an R 7 s fitting which
is<00:00:58.050> exactly<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.710> same<00:00:58.890> as<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.730> linear

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
is exactly the same as the linear

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.400 
is exactly the same as the linear
halogen<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:00.510> we<00:01:00.600> can<00:01:00.780> actually<00:01:00.899> just<00:01:01.079> swap<00:01:01.289> it

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
halogen so we can actually just swap it

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.500 
halogen so we can actually just swap it
out<00:01:01.530> it's<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.010> little<00:01:02.250> bit<00:01:02.370> wider<00:01:02.550> but<00:01:03.180> there<00:01:03.359> is

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
out it's a little bit wider but there is

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.420 
out it's a little bit wider but there is
actually<00:01:03.719> enough<00:01:04.260> clearance<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.250> light

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
actually enough clearance in the light

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.000 
actually enough clearance in the light

sort<00:02:05.030> of<00:02:05.120> nipple<00:02:05.480> here<00:02:05.750> on<00:02:05.960> the<00:02:06.080> lamp<00:02:06.290> I'm

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
sort of nipple here on the lamp I'm

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.550 
sort of nipple here on the lamp I'm
going<00:02:07.400> to<00:02:07.460> put<00:02:07.640> this<00:02:07.760> down<00:02:08.380> because<00:02:09.380> I'm<00:02:09.440> not

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
going to put this down because I'm not

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:35.880 
going to put this down because I'm not
sure<00:02:09.800> if<00:02:10.130> it'll<00:02:10.369> clear<00:02:10.760> the<00:02:11.030> glass<00:02:11.540> cover<00:02:12.190> so

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.740 

deal<00:02:36.890> with<00:02:37.070> the<00:02:37.250> dimmer<00:02:37.580> so<00:02:38.030> it's<00:02:38.420> just<00:02:38.570> matter

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
deal with the dimmer so it's just matter

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.360 
deal with the dimmer so it's just matter
of<00:02:38.870> unscrewing<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:39.410> dimmer<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:39.890> removing

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
of unscrewing the dimmer and removing

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.760 
of unscrewing the dimmer and removing
the<00:02:40.459> wires<00:02:43.600> they<00:02:44.600> see<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:44.990> dimmer<00:02:45.170> circuits

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
the wires they see the dimmer circuits

labeled slots simply push down push the
wire<00:03:14.180> in<00:03:16.360> so<00:03:17.360> now<00:03:17.450> I<00:03:17.480> just<00:03:17.570> do<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:17.989> same<00:03:18.170> thing

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
wire in so now I just do the same thing

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.970 
wire in so now I just do the same thing
for<00:03:18.860> the<00:03:19.540> main<00:03:20.540> supply<00:03:20.959> which<00:03:21.350> goes<00:03:21.560> in<00:03:21.769> like

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
for the main supply which goes in like

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.870 
for the main supply which goes in like
that<00:03:22.209> there<00:03:23.209> we<00:03:23.330> push<00:03:23.570> down<00:03:23.810> and<00:03:24.110> push<00:03:24.350> in

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
that there we push down and push in

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.150 
that there we push down and push in
that's<00:03:25.880> the<00:03:26.150> lamp<00:03:26.840> wire<00:03:27.080> and<00:03:27.410> the<00:03:27.709> mains<00:03:27.920> wire

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
that's the lamp wire and the mains wire

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.070 
that's the lamp wire and the mains wire
now<00:03:28.370> connected<00:03:28.850> to<00:03:28.880> these<00:03:29.090> screw<00:03:29.450> terminals

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 
now connected to these screw terminals

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.979 
now connected to these screw terminals
close<00:03:30.290> the<00:03:30.440> flap<00:03:30.650> and<00:03:31.480> we<00:03:32.480> just<00:03:32.630> plug<00:03:32.810> it<00:03:32.900> in

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
close the flap and we just plug it in

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:40.240 
close the flap and we just plug it in
and<00:03:33.050> see<00:03:33.530> what<00:03:33.620> happens

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.430 

there<00:03:40.760> we<00:03:40.850> go<00:03:41.770> lighting<00:03:42.770> up<00:03:43.900> so<00:03:44.900> there<00:03:45.200> we<00:03:45.290> have

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
there we go lighting up so there we have

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.730 
there we go lighting up so there we have
it

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:45.740 
it

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.830 
it
the<00:03:45.890> final<00:03:46.280> item<00:03:47.680> 6000<00:03:48.680> lumen<00:03:49.010> light<00:03:49.840> 470

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
the final item 6000 lumen light 470

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.770 
the final item 6000 lumen light 470
watts<00:03:51.050> of<00:03:51.320> power<00:03:51.590> a<00:03:51.980> bit<00:03:52.760> of<00:03:53.000> a<00:03:53.060> reduction<00:03:53.540> from

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
watts of power a bit of a reduction from

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.740 
watts of power a bit of a reduction from
230<00:03:54.740> and<00:03:55.340> it's<00:03:55.640> a<00:03:55.730> pretty<00:03:55.910> nice<00:03:56.090> light<00:03:56.480> it's

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
230 and it's a pretty nice light it's

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.730 
230 and it's a pretty nice light it's
very<00:03:56.990> white<00:03:57.260> this<00:03:57.770> is<00:03:57.950> actually<00:03:58.250> a<00:03:58.310> 4000<00:03:59.090> K<00:03:59.740> hid

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:00.740 
very white this is actually a 4000 K hid

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.650 
very white this is actually a 4000 K hid
lamp<00:04:01.070> so<00:04:01.430> it's<00:04:01.550> slightly<00:04:01.820> whiter<00:04:02.209> than<00:04:02.510> your

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
lamp so it's slightly whiter than your

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.800 
lamp so it's slightly whiter than your
normal<00:04:02.780> halogen<00:04:03.440> but<00:04:04.190> it's<00:04:04.730> still<00:04:04.970> reasonable

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
normal halogen but it's still reasonable

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.850 
normal halogen but it's still reasonable
it's<00:04:05.930> not<00:04:06.080> blue<00:04:06.380> like<00:04:06.740> those<00:04:07.160> cheap<00:04:08.860> HID

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
it's not blue like those cheap HID

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.240 
it's not blue like those cheap HID
lights<00:04:10.190> that<00:04:10.340> you<00:04:10.400> get<00:04:10.580> in<00:04:10.790> cars<00:04:11.510> and<00:04:11.900> stuff<00:04:12.250> so

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
lights that you get in cars and stuff so

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.449 
lights that you get in cars and stuff so
this<00:04:13.400> is<00:04:13.520> pretty<00:04:13.700> nice<00:04:14.380> and<00:04:15.380> the<00:04:16.100> only<00:04:16.220> problem

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
this is pretty nice and the only problem

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:17.979 
this is pretty nice and the only problem
is<00:04:16.609> it<00:04:16.730> takes<00:04:16.910> a<00:04:17.000> little<00:04:17.090> time<00:04:17.209> to<00:04:17.359> warm<00:04:17.660> up<00:04:17.810> it

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
is it takes a little time to warm up it

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.479 
is it takes a little time to warm up it
takes<00:04:18.200> about<00:04:18.320> a<00:04:18.440> minute<00:04:18.680> to<00:04:18.859> come<00:04:19.160> up<00:04:19.250> to<00:04:19.370> full

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
takes about a minute to come up to full

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.520 
takes about a minute to come up to full
brightness<00:04:19.669> so<00:04:20.180> it's<00:04:20.299> in<00:04:20.480> that<00:04:21.200> way<00:04:21.320> it's<00:04:21.470> a

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
brightness so it's in that way it's a

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.280 
brightness so it's in that way it's a
bit<00:04:21.680> like<00:04:21.859> your<00:04:22.450> compact<00:04:23.450> fluorescent<00:04:23.930> bulbs

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
bit like your compact fluorescent bulbs

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:25.900 
bit like your compact fluorescent bulbs
it<00:04:24.410> has<00:04:24.500> a<00:04:24.530> warm<00:04:24.830> up<00:04:24.950> time<00:04:25.160> but<00:04:25.340> the<00:04:25.460> warm<00:04:25.669> up<00:04:25.790> is

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
it has a warm up time but the warm up is

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.390 
it has a warm up time but the warm up is
a<00:04:25.970> bit<00:04:26.120> more<00:04:26.270> pronounced<00:04:27.100> and<00:04:28.100> the<00:04:28.280> other

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
a bit more pronounced and the other

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.430 
a bit more pronounced and the other
problem<00:04:28.790> is<00:04:28.910> is<00:04:29.150> which<00:04:29.690> is<00:04:29.810> actually<00:04:29.930> really

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
problem is is which is actually really

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.470 
problem is is which is actually really
annoying<00:04:30.710> so<00:04:31.280> you<00:04:31.340> have<00:04:31.669> to<00:04:31.790> be<00:04:31.880> very<00:04:32.060> careful

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
annoying so you have to be very careful

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.420 
annoying so you have to be very careful
where<00:04:32.630> you<00:04:32.750> choose<00:04:32.990> to<00:04:33.050> put<00:04:33.169> this<00:04:33.470> light<00:04:33.740> is

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
where you choose to put this light is

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.020 
where you choose to put this light is
that<00:04:34.640> if<00:04:34.850> you<00:04:35.000> unplug<00:04:35.150> it<00:04:35.980> like<00:04:36.980> so<00:04:37.280> and<00:04:37.580> then

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
that if you unplug it like so and then

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.180 
that if you unplug it like so and then
plug<00:04:38.750> it<00:04:38.840> back<00:04:38.900> in<00:04:39.169> again<00:04:39.290> the<00:04:39.740> light<00:04:39.919> does<00:04:40.160> not

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
plug it back in again the light does not

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.750 
plug it back in again the light does not
come<00:04:40.400> back<00:04:40.880> on<00:04:41.500> if<00:04:42.500> we<00:04:42.650> look<00:04:42.800> at<00:04:42.890> it<00:04:43.010> it<00:04:43.730> is

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
come back on if we look at it it is

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.210 
come back on if we look at it it is
completely<00:04:44.570> extinguished<00:04:45.140> and<00:04:45.440> that<00:04:46.100> is

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
completely extinguished and that is

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.920 
completely extinguished and that is
because<00:04:46.669> the<00:04:47.240> lamp<00:04:47.479> is<00:04:47.660> not<00:04:47.900> able<00:04:48.140> to<00:04:48.350> start<00:04:48.830> up

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
because the lamp is not able to start up

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.170 
because the lamp is not able to start up
while<00:04:50.930> the<00:04:51.470> lamp<00:04:51.950> is<00:04:52.160> hot<00:04:52.370> so<00:04:52.729> it<00:04:52.850> needs<00:04:53.060> about

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
while the lamp is hot so it needs about

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.210 
while the lamp is hot so it needs about
two<00:04:53.600> or<00:04:53.690> three<00:04:53.720> minutes<00:04:54.229> of<00:04:54.380> cooldown<00:04:54.830> time

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
two or three minutes of cooldown time

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.090 
two or three minutes of cooldown time
before<00:04:56.060> it<00:04:56.210> will<00:04:56.330> restart<00:04:56.780> and<00:04:57.200> then<00:04:57.979> of

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
before it will restart and then of

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.530 
before it will restart and then of
course<00:04:58.130> once<00:04:58.550> it's<00:04:58.729> cooled<00:04:59.000> down<00:04:59.180> and<00:04:59.419> it's

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
course once it's cooled down and it's

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.390 
course once it's cooled down and it's
restarted<00:05:00.169> it<00:05:00.260> needs<00:05:00.470> another<00:05:00.590> minute<00:05:00.890> or<00:05:01.160> so

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
restarted it needs another minute or so

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.500 
restarted it needs another minute or so
to<00:05:02.060> come<00:05:02.240> up<00:05:02.390> to<00:05:02.510> full<00:05:02.540> power<00:05:02.919> but<00:05:04.240> it<00:05:05.240> cuts

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
to come up to full power but it cuts

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.040 
to come up to full power but it cuts
your<00:05:05.630> energy<00:05:05.720> consumption<00:05:06.640> by<00:05:07.640> 75%<00:05:08.270> and<00:05:08.870> it's

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
your energy consumption by 75% and it's

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.150 
your energy consumption by 75% and it's
pretty<00:05:09.530> nice<00:05:09.740> light<00:05:10.100> so<00:05:10.970> in<00:05:11.780> some<00:05:12.080> cases<00:05:12.320> this

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
pretty nice light so in some cases this

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.479 
pretty nice light so in some cases this
might<00:05:13.400> well<00:05:13.640> be<00:05:13.820> a<00:05:13.850> useful<00:05:14.330> model
