00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.010 

in<00:01:54.200> 2004<00:01:55.160> the<00:01:55.850> smoke<00:01:56.120> was<00:01:56.300> rebuilt<00:01:56.810> and

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
in 2004 the smoke was rebuilt and

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.350 
in 2004 the smoke was rebuilt and
resurfaced<00:01:57.740> what<00:01:58.460> we've<00:01:58.610> had<00:01:58.730> before<00:01:59.120> was<00:01:59.330> a

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
resurfaced what we've had before was a

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.880 
resurfaced what we've had before was a
slope<00:01:59.660> that<00:01:59.840> wasn't<00:02:00.110> really<00:02:00.230> fit<00:02:00.530> for<00:02:00.740> purpose

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
slope that wasn't really fit for purpose

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.620 
slope that wasn't really fit for purpose
in<00:02:01.190> the<00:02:01.310> sense<00:02:01.340> that<00:02:01.610> it<00:02:01.790> was<00:02:01.850> far<00:02:02.090> too<00:02:02.150> steep

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
in the sense that it was far too steep

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.410 
in the sense that it was far too steep
for<00:02:02.660> teaching<00:02:03.140> beginners<00:02:03.820> and<00:02:04.820> the<00:02:05.030> surface

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
for teaching beginners and the surface

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.510 
for teaching beginners and the surface
on<00:02:05.600> it<00:02:05.720> was<00:02:05.870> the<00:02:06.020> old<00:02:06.170> push<00:02:06.950> cross<00:02:07.190> type

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
on it was the old push cross type

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.279 
on it was the old push cross type
matching<00:02:07.970> that<00:02:08.060> was<00:02:08.209> very<00:02:08.390> very<00:02:08.690> difficult<00:02:08.990> if

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
matching that was very very difficult if

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.020 
matching that was very very difficult if
you<00:02:09.380> fell<00:02:09.590> down<00:02:09.830> on<00:02:10.009> it<00:02:10.130> very<00:02:10.490> very<00:02:10.670> hard

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
you fell down on it very very hard

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.280 
you fell down on it very very hard
indeed<00:02:11.380> so<00:02:12.700> we<00:02:13.700> went<00:02:13.910> to<00:02:14.000> impact<00:02:14.720> leisure<00:02:14.959> and

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
indeed so we went to impact leisure and

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.380 
indeed so we went to impact leisure and
they<00:02:15.440> did<00:02:15.650> a<00:02:15.680> design<00:02:15.950> and<00:02:16.520> build<00:02:16.760> job<00:02:17.060> for<00:02:17.360> us

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
they did a design and build job for us

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.300 
they did a design and build job for us
so<00:02:18.080> the<00:02:18.170> whole<00:02:18.320> slope<00:02:18.709> that<00:02:18.860> you<00:02:18.920> can<00:02:19.160> see

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
so the whole slope that you can see

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.790 
so the whole slope that you can see
behind<00:02:19.520> you<00:02:19.850> was<00:02:20.030> repro<00:02:20.510> filed<00:02:20.810> so<00:02:21.620> if<00:02:21.680> you

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
behind you was repro filed so if you

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.620 
behind you was repro filed so if you
look<00:02:21.950> over<00:02:22.310> on<00:02:22.370> on<00:02:22.700> one<00:02:23.000> side<00:02:23.300> it's<00:02:23.510> a

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
look over on on one side it's a

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.470 
look over on on one side it's a
consistent<00:02:24.250> consistent<00:02:25.250> gradient<00:02:25.730> for<00:02:26.000> the

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
consistent consistent gradient for the

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.110 
consistent consistent gradient for the
beginners<00:02:27.290> all<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.560> way<00:02:27.709> down<00:02:28.010> and<00:02:28.610> it<00:02:29.030> was

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
beginners all the way down and it was

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.380 
beginners all the way down and it was
resurfaced<00:02:30.010> and<00:02:31.010> enlarged<00:02:31.790> a<00:02:31.910> bit<00:02:32.060> as<00:02:32.180> well

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
resurfaced and enlarged a bit as well

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.520 
resurfaced and enlarged a bit as well
and<00:02:32.660> covered<00:02:33.020> with<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:33.260> play<00:02:33.410> grass<00:02:33.680> surface

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
and covered with the play grass surface

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.380 
and covered with the play grass surface
at<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.950> time<00:02:37.190> we<00:02:37.520> didn't<00:02:37.790> know<00:02:37.880> how<00:02:38.060> well<00:02:38.270> it

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
at the time we didn't know how well it

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.960 
at the time we didn't know how well it
would<00:02:38.510> last<00:02:38.750> however<00:02:39.680> we've<00:02:40.370> now<00:02:40.400> had<00:02:40.670> it<00:02:40.790> down

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
would last however we've now had it down

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.760 
would last however we've now had it down
for<00:02:41.209> six<00:02:41.390> years<00:02:41.660> and<00:02:41.840> we<00:02:41.989> can't<00:02:42.260> really<00:02:42.440> see

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
for six years and we can't really see

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.220 
for six years and we can't really see
much<00:02:43.459> wear<00:02:43.760> on<00:02:43.910> it<00:02:44.030> at<00:02:44.180> all<00:02:44.360> if<00:02:44.570> there<00:02:44.810> is<00:02:44.930> wear

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
much wear on it at all if there is wear

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.920 
much wear on it at all if there is wear
then<00:02:45.830> it's<00:02:45.980> just<00:02:46.160> a<00:02:46.250> very<00:02:46.459> very<00:02:47.300> general<00:02:47.690> wear

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
then it's just a very very general wear

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.470 
then it's just a very very general wear
but<00:02:48.320> we<00:02:48.470> would<00:02:48.650> have<00:02:48.739> expected<00:02:49.300> with<00:02:50.300> what

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
but we would have expected with what

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.150 
but we would have expected with what
we've<00:02:50.630> had<00:02:50.810> before<00:02:51.200> that<00:02:51.230> by<00:02:51.590> now<00:02:51.830> we'd<00:02:52.130> have

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
we've had before that by now we'd have

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.590 
we've had before that by now we'd have
had<00:02:52.370> to<00:02:52.400> change<00:02:52.489> some<00:02:53.060> some<00:02:53.420> of<00:02:53.540> the

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
had to change some some of the

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.840 
had to change some some of the
individual<00:02:54.080> mats<00:02:54.459> or<00:02:55.459> just<00:02:55.700> with<00:02:55.820> just

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
individual mats or just with just

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:01.120 
individual mats or just with just
motorized<00:02:56.630> repair<00:02:57.080> work<00:02:59.590> these<00:03:00.590> days<00:03:00.650> we've

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
motorized repair work these days we've

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.610 
motorized repair work these days we've
got<00:03:01.340> a<00:03:01.640> large<00:03:02.269> number<00:03:02.390> of<00:03:02.690> members<00:03:02.900> is<00:03:03.230> between

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
got a large number of members is between

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.229 
got a large number of members is between
about<00:03:03.860> a<00:03:03.890> thousand<00:03:04.430> and<00:03:04.549> twelve<00:03:04.730> hundred<00:03:05.000> it

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
about a thousand and twelve hundred it

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.720 
about a thousand and twelve hundred it
varies<00:03:06.110> before<00:03:06.799> we<00:03:06.920> had<00:03:07.040> the<00:03:07.160> work<00:03:07.340> done<00:03:07.580> it

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
varies before we had the work done it

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.810 
varies before we had the work done it
was<00:03:07.820> about<00:03:08.030> 350<00:03:08.750> to<00:03:09.049> 400<00:03:09.680> so<00:03:10.250> having<00:03:10.430> the<00:03:10.670> new

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
was about 350 to 400 so having the new

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.930 
was about 350 to 400 so having the new
slope<00:03:11.209> and<00:03:11.480> we've<00:03:12.110> got<00:03:12.260> a<00:03:12.290> good<00:03:12.470> reputation

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
slope and we've got a good reputation

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.580 
slope and we've got a good reputation
it's<00:03:13.940> very<00:03:14.180> good<00:03:14.480> I<00:03:14.600> mean<00:03:14.810> in<00:03:14.900> winter<00:03:15.230> we<00:03:15.380> run

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
it's very good I mean in winter we run

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.949 
it's very good I mean in winter we run
at<00:03:15.739> capacity<00:03:16.040> with<00:03:16.549> lessons<00:03:16.910> was<00:03:17.600> being<00:03:17.840> a

at capacity with lessons was being a

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.890 
at capacity with lessons was being a
voluntary<00:03:18.560> Club<00:03:18.940> we're<00:03:19.940> only<00:03:20.090> open<00:03:20.180> 20<00:03:20.720> hours

voluntary Club we're only open 20 hours
a<00:03:21.080> week<00:03:21.110> and<00:03:22.100> all<00:03:22.340> all<00:03:22.580> the<00:03:22.700> lessons<00:03:23.060> are<00:03:23.180> full

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
a week and all all the lessons are full

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:31.259 
a week and all all the lessons are full
and<00:03:25.000> people<00:03:26.000> enjoy<00:03:26.239> skiing<00:03:26.540> on<00:03:26.780> it

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.729 

one<00:03:32.269> of<00:03:32.360> the<00:03:32.420> things<00:03:32.629> about<00:03:32.780> this<00:03:33.080> surface<00:03:33.530> is

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
one of the things about this surface is

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.559 
one of the things about this surface is
it<00:03:34.010> encourages<00:03:34.640> people<00:03:34.670> to<00:03:35.000> use<00:03:35.209> correct

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:35.569 
it encourages people to use correct

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.699 
it encourages people to use correct
technique<00:03:36.250> if<00:03:37.840> some<00:03:38.840> people<00:03:38.989> will<00:03:39.290> come<00:03:39.470> along

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
technique if some people will come along

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.289 
technique if some people will come along
and<00:03:39.950> they<00:03:40.129> can<00:03:40.280> get<00:03:40.430> away<00:03:40.519> with<00:03:40.670> twitching

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
and they can get away with twitching

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.539 
and they can get away with twitching
their<00:03:41.420> bodies<00:03:41.750> and<00:03:41.900> switching<00:03:42.260> their<00:03:42.409> skis<00:03:42.680> on

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
their bodies and switching their skis on

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:45.399 
their bodies and switching their skis on
snow<00:03:43.909> and<00:03:43.940> think<00:03:44.360> they<00:03:44.450> don't<00:03:44.659> parallel<00:03:45.110> turns

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:45.409 
snow and think they don't parallel turns

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:47.830 
snow and think they don't parallel turns
this<00:03:45.920> surface<00:03:46.640> is<00:03:46.790> really<00:03:47.180> very<00:03:47.390> good<00:03:47.599> for

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
this surface is really very good for

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.569 
this surface is really very good for
encouraging<00:03:48.319> good<00:03:48.500> technique<00:03:48.950> and<00:03:49.430> that's

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
encouraging good technique and that's

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:52.300 
encouraging good technique and that's
what<00:03:49.730> we<00:03:49.849> try<00:03:50.030> to<00:03:50.060> do<00:03:50.360> here<00:03:50.390> so<00:03:51.379> we<00:03:52.010> like<00:03:52.190> to

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
what we try to do here so we like to

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.649 
what we try to do here so we like to
think<00:03:52.549> that<00:03:52.610> people<00:03:53.000> have<00:03:53.090> learned<00:03:53.209> a<00:03:53.420> kid's

00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:53.659 
think that people have learned a kid's

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:56.020 
think that people have learned a kid's
Grove<00:03:53.900> I've<00:03:54.799> been<00:03:55.010> taught<00:03:55.340> the<00:03:55.489> correct

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
Grove I've been taught the correct

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.839 
Grove I've been taught the correct
technique<00:03:56.480> and<00:03:57.069> that's<00:03:58.069> good<00:03:58.610> with<00:03:58.760> this

00:03:58.839 --> 00:03:58.849 
technique and that's good with this

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:00.789 
technique and that's good with this
circuit<00:03:59.299> we're<00:03:59.870> really<00:04:00.140> very<00:04:00.409> pleased<00:04:00.680> with

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
circuit we're really very pleased with

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.250 
circuit we're really very pleased with
it<00:04:00.920> I<00:04:01.310> think<00:04:02.209> one<00:04:02.450> other<00:04:02.599> thing<00:04:02.870> that<00:04:02.900> that's

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
it I think one other thing that that's

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.920 
it I think one other thing that that's
that's<00:04:03.799> worked<00:04:04.160> well<00:04:04.400> is<00:04:04.579> that<00:04:04.940> the<00:04:05.090> slope<00:04:05.690> was

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
that's worked well is that the slope was

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.580 
that's worked well is that the slope was
laid<00:04:06.170> correctly<00:04:06.739> in<00:04:06.890> other<00:04:07.040> words<00:04:08.530> there's<00:04:09.530> a

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
laid correctly in other words there's a

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.979 
laid correctly in other words there's a
proper<00:04:10.129> stone<00:04:10.400> base<00:04:10.730> with<00:04:11.090> a<00:04:11.120> wooden<00:04:11.450> grid<00:04:11.690> and

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
proper stone base with a wooden grid and

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.810 
proper stone base with a wooden grid and
it's<00:04:12.470> got<00:04:12.680> the<00:04:12.859> cushioned<00:04:13.760> under<00:04:14.030> under<00:04:14.870> shock

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:15.820 
it's got the cushioned under under shock

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.129 
it's got the cushioned under under shock
material<00:04:16.820> that<00:04:16.970> sits<00:04:17.180> underneath<00:04:17.449> the<00:04:17.720> carpet

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
material that sits underneath the carpet

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:19.990 
material that sits underneath the carpet
and<00:04:18.260> the<00:04:18.350> cup<00:04:18.560> the<00:04:18.859> combination<00:04:19.459> really<00:04:19.699> of

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
and the cup the combination really of

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.400 
and the cup the combination really of
the<00:04:20.180> carpet<00:04:20.660> and<00:04:20.810> the<00:04:22.300> underlay<00:04:23.300> makes<00:04:24.229> the

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
the carpet and the underlay makes the

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.260 
the carpet and the underlay makes the
surface<00:04:24.620> extremely<00:04:25.370> forgiving<00:04:25.789> that<00:04:25.910> people

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
surface extremely forgiving that people

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.870 
surface extremely forgiving that people
fall<00:04:26.510> over<00:04:26.870> and<00:04:27.139> of<00:04:27.830> course<00:04:28.039> people<00:04:28.400> do<00:04:28.580> fall

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
fall over and of course people do fall

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.020 
fall over and of course people do fall
over<00:04:29.240> when<00:04:29.780> they're<00:04:29.960> skiing<00:04:30.199> every<00:04:30.500> so<00:04:30.680> often

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
over when they're skiing every so often

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.570 
over when they're skiing every so often
some<00:04:32.030> other<00:04:32.180> surfaces<00:04:32.800> if<00:04:33.800> you<00:04:33.949> fall<00:04:34.160> over<00:04:34.190> you

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
some other surfaces if you fall over you

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:40.540 
some other surfaces if you fall over you
can<00:04:34.760> get<00:04:34.940> quite<00:04:35.150> badly<00:04:35.419> hurt<00:04:38.080> finally<00:04:39.080> we<00:04:40.070> keep

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
can get quite badly hurt finally we keep

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.000 
can get quite badly hurt finally we keep
it<00:04:40.729> lubricated<00:04:41.000> as<00:04:41.510> well<00:04:41.720> if<00:04:42.590> it's<00:04:42.770> raining

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
it lubricated as well if it's raining

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.400 
it lubricated as well if it's raining
obviously<00:04:43.550> it<00:04:43.880> runs<00:04:44.389> nicely<00:04:44.930> but<00:04:45.080> when<00:04:45.260> it's

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
obviously it runs nicely but when it's

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.650 
obviously it runs nicely but when it's
drive<00:04:45.710> we<00:04:45.979> need<00:04:46.010> to<00:04:46.280> lubricate<00:04:46.760> it<00:04:47.120> and<00:04:47.330> we've

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
drive we need to lubricate it and we've

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.839 
drive we need to lubricate it and we've
got<00:04:47.840> a<00:04:47.870> proper<00:04:48.260> proper<00:04:48.860> full<00:04:49.070> misting<00:04:49.490> system

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:49.849 
got a proper proper full misting system

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:52.240 
got a proper proper full misting system
that<00:04:50.000> was<00:04:50.150> installed<00:04:50.330> as<00:04:50.780> well<00:04:50.930> and<00:04:51.889> it's<00:04:52.130> all

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
that was installed as well and it's all

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.420 
that was installed as well and it's all
been<00:04:52.430> worth<00:04:52.639> the<00:04:52.669> money<00:04:53.800> after<00:04:54.800> after<00:04:55.220> six

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
been worth the money after after six

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.320 
been worth the money after after six
years<00:04:55.690> you<00:04:56.690> can<00:04:56.870> see<00:04:57.050> it<00:04:57.139> running<00:04:57.500> now<00:04:57.530> and

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
years you can see it running now and

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.339 
years you can see it running now and
we've<00:04:59.330> got<00:04:59.449> no<00:04:59.599> problems<00:04:59.960> with<00:04:59.990> it<00:05:00.199> we're

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:00.349 
we've got no problems with it we're

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:01.810 
we've got no problems with it we're
still<00:05:00.500> not<00:05:00.710> quite<00:05:00.860> sure<00:05:00.979> when<00:05:01.370> we'll<00:05:01.550> need<00:05:01.669> to

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
still not quite sure when we'll need to

00:05:01.820 --> 00:06:47.270 
still not quite sure when we'll need to
remove

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:07:02.070 

you
