this technique to play the Blues in G so
with<00:00:18.460> our<00:00:18.610> right<00:00:18.849> hand<00:00:19.079> we're<00:00:20.079> going<00:00:20.200> to<00:00:20.259> be

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:20.349 
with our right hand we're going to be

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:23.070 
with our right hand we're going to be
out<00:00:20.380> loaning<00:00:20.950> the<00:00:21.250> tritones<00:00:22.060> of<00:00:22.300> the<00:00:22.630> g<00:00:22.840> chord

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:23.080 
out loaning the tritones of the g chord

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.769 
out loaning the tritones of the g chord
so<00:00:23.680> when<00:00:23.800> we're<00:00:23.920> playing<00:00:24.130> a<00:00:24.279> G<00:00:24.599> we're<00:00:25.599> going<00:00:25.630> to

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:25.779 
so when we're playing a G we're going to

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:28.980 
so when we're playing a G we're going to
be<00:00:25.840> playing<00:00:26.109> the<00:00:26.740> 7th<00:00:27.310> of<00:00:27.640> this<00:00:27.789> F<00:00:28.000> and<00:00:28.630> the

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:28.990 
be playing the 7th of this F and the

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.900 
be playing the 7th of this F and the
third<00:00:29.289> which<00:00:29.769> is<00:00:29.859> the<00:00:29.920> B<00:00:32.100> right<00:00:33.100> now<00:00:33.400> initially

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
third which is the B right now initially

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:34.950 
third which is the B right now initially
I<00:00:33.940> think<00:00:34.059> what<00:00:34.330> we're<00:00:34.480> gonna<00:00:34.600> do<00:00:34.690> is<00:00:34.809> we're

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
I think what we're gonna do is we're

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.990 
I think what we're gonna do is we're
gonna<00:00:35.019> do<00:00:35.290> a<00:00:35.320> walking<00:00:35.680> left<00:00:36.129> hand<00:00:36.430> which<00:00:36.970> is

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
gonna do a walking left hand which is

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.450 
gonna do a walking left hand which is
the<00:00:37.210> root<00:00:37.360> third<00:00:37.600> fifth<00:00:37.629> well<00:00:38.589> just<00:00:38.830> playing<00:00:39.129> a

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
the root third fifth well just playing a

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:49.289 
the root third fifth well just playing a
static<00:00:40.420> right<00:00:40.570> hand<00:00:45.210> right<00:00:46.210> now<00:00:48.239> when<00:00:49.239> we

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:49.299 
static right hand right now when we

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:52.799 
static right hand right now when we
switch<00:00:49.540> to<00:00:50.040> the<00:00:51.040> C<00:00:51.309> chord<00:00:51.670> all<00:00:52.239> we<00:00:52.449> have<00:00:52.540> to<00:00:52.659> do

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
switch to the C chord all we have to do

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:55.500 
switch to the C chord all we have to do
is<00:00:52.960> move<00:00:53.229> our<00:00:53.500> right<00:00:54.190> hand<00:00:54.460> down<00:00:54.760> half<00:00:55.089> a<00:00:55.180> fret

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
is move our right hand down half a fret

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.490 
is move our right hand down half a fret
so<00:00:56.350> we'll<00:00:56.530> be<00:00:56.710> the<00:00:56.830> 3rd<00:00:57.129> of<00:00:57.339> the<00:00:57.400> 7th<00:00:57.850> of<00:00:58.809> the<00:00:59.170> C

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
so we'll be the 3rd of the 7th of the C

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.220 
so we'll be the 3rd of the 7th of the C
chord
