get myself hydrated it has it's very

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:36.160 
get myself hydrated it has it's very
very<00:01:33.920> good<00:01:33.979> it's<00:01:34.700> not<00:01:34.940> sweet<00:01:35.330> at<00:01:35.570> all<00:01:35.690> but<00:01:35.990> it

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
very good it's not sweet at all but it

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.810 
very good it's not sweet at all but it
then<00:01:36.470> in<00:01:36.740> the<00:01:36.860> same<00:01:37.070> sense<00:01:37.310> it<00:01:37.520> has<00:01:37.610> like<00:01:37.789> a

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
then in the same sense it has like a

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.649 
then in the same sense it has like a
natural<00:01:38.360> sweetness<00:01:38.780> to<00:01:38.990> it<00:01:39.020> from<00:01:39.649> the<00:01:39.830> carrot

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
natural sweetness to it from the carrot

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.080 
natural sweetness to it from the carrot
definitely<00:01:41.659> I<00:01:41.690> think<00:01:42.460> the<00:01:43.460> cucumber's

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
definitely I think the cucumber's

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.650 
definitely I think the cucumber's
overpowers<00:01:44.929> the<00:01:45.860> carrots<00:01:46.610> but<00:01:47.090> you<00:01:47.209> can<00:01:47.390> taste

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
overpowers the carrots but you can taste

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.540 
overpowers the carrots but you can taste
a<00:01:47.899> little<00:01:48.140> bit<00:01:48.380> of<00:01:48.500> sweetness<00:01:48.890> of<00:01:49.099> the<00:01:49.190> carrots

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
a little bit of sweetness of the carrots

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.339 
a little bit of sweetness of the carrots
and<00:01:49.729> also<00:01:50.179> the<00:01:50.420> coulomb<00:01:50.750> but<00:01:50.899> I<00:01:50.929> think<00:01:51.140> it's<00:01:51.259> a

00:01:51.339 --> 00:01:51.349 
and also the coulomb but I think it's a

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:53.020 
and also the coulomb but I think it's a
component<00:01:51.830> that<00:01:51.890> makes<00:01:52.099> it<00:01:52.250> very<00:01:52.369> hydrating

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
component that makes it very hydrating

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.969 
component that makes it very hydrating
and<00:01:53.179> I<00:01:53.450> like<00:01:53.660> it<00:01:53.840> so<00:01:54.050> much<00:01:56.679> definitely<00:01:57.679> gets

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
and I like it so much definitely gets

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.070 
and I like it so much definitely gets
