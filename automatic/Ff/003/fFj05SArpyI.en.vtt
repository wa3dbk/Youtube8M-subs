it's<00:01:33.729> been<00:01:33.880> challenging<00:01:34.149> that<00:01:34.569> I've<00:01:34.719> learned

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:34.929 
it's been challenging that I've learned

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:36.809 
it's been challenging that I've learned
a<00:01:35.049> lot<00:01:35.079> for<00:01:35.709> every<00:01:36.069> student<00:01:36.369> there's<00:01:36.759> a

00:01:36.809 --> 00:01:36.819 
a lot for every student there's a

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:38.849 
a lot for every student there's a
slightly<00:01:37.539> different<00:01:37.959> reason<00:01:38.499> that<00:01:38.649> they're

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:38.859 
slightly different reason that they're

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:41.699 
slightly different reason that they're
pursuing<00:01:39.579> an<00:01:39.880> online<00:01:40.329> degree<00:01:40.569> many<00:01:41.409> of<00:01:41.590> them

00:01:41.699 --> 00:01:41.709 
pursuing an online degree many of them

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:43.769 
pursuing an online degree many of them
it<00:01:41.919> is<00:01:42.069> convenience<00:01:42.759> many<00:01:43.240> of<00:01:43.389> them<00:01:43.509> simply

00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:43.779 
it is convenience many of them simply

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:46.440 
it is convenience many of them simply
can't<00:01:44.229> come<00:01:44.560> to<00:01:44.770> the<00:01:44.859> college<00:01:45.219> campus<00:01:45.729> and<00:01:45.939> so

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
can't come to the college campus and so

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.809 
can't come to the college campus and so
we<00:01:46.719> offer<00:01:46.959> these<00:01:47.289> degrees<00:01:47.590> with<00:01:48.369> the<00:01:48.520> same
