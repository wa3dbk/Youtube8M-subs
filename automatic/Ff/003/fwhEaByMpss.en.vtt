00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:14.750 
also good but not as expansive of a
sound<00:02:13.290> but<00:02:13.560> obviously<00:02:13.830> with<00:02:14.010> six<00:02:14.220> drivers<00:02:14.459> is

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
sound but obviously with six drivers is

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.910 
sound but obviously with six drivers is
just<00:02:14.970> going<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.150> be<00:02:15.269> a<00:02:15.480> little<00:02:16.049> richer<00:02:16.500> overall

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920
