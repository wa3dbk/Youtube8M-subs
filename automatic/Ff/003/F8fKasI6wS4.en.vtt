have for us Michael
the<00:00:43.260> Raspberry<00:00:43.710> Pi<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:44.070> course<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.640> course

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
the Raspberry Pi of course of course

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.670 
the Raspberry Pi of course of course
because<00:00:45.510> that's<00:00:45.690> all<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:45.989> talk<00:00:46.230> about<00:00:46.260> on<00:00:46.530> this

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
because that's all I talk about on this

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.260 
because that's all I talk about on this
show<00:00:46.739> you're<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.160> go-to<00:00:47.399> guy<00:00:47.550> yes<00:00:48.059> the

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
show you're a go-to guy yes the

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.940 
show you're a go-to guy yes the
Raspberry<00:00:48.629> Pi<00:00:48.660> but<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.469> really<00:00:49.739> great

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
Raspberry Pi but it is really great

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.220 
Raspberry Pi but it is really great
because<00:00:50.219> it's<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.579> low<00:00:50.879> powered<00:00:51.270> computer<00:00:51.870> that

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
because it's a low powered computer that

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.930 
because it's a low powered computer that
it<00:00:52.440> really<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:53.070> computer<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.820> only

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
it really is a computer and it only

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.910 
it really is a computer and it only
costs<00:00:54.300> 35<00:00:54.719> bucks<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.350> are<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.500> saying<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:55.800> we

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
costs 35 bucks so are you saying that we

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.110 
costs 35 bucks so are you saying that we
could<00:00:56.039> use<00:00:56.190> this<00:00:56.340> as<00:00:56.520> like<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.670> Google<00:00:57.030> Cloud

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
could use this as like a Google Cloud

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.420 
could use this as like a Google Cloud
Print<00:00:57.239> server<00:00:57.719> yes<00:00:58.199> so<00:00:58.530> it's<00:00:58.800> exactly<00:00:59.219> what

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
Print server yes so it's exactly what

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.040 
Print server yes so it's exactly what
Kyle<00:00:59.820> was<00:01:00.090> thinking<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.600> he<00:01:00.719> would<00:01:00.780> have<00:01:00.930> to

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
Kyle was thinking that he would have to

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.200 
Kyle was thinking that he would have to
have<00:01:01.140> an<00:01:01.260> always-on<00:01:01.710> computer<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.579> do<00:01:02.730> Google

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
have an always-on computer to do Google

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.000 
have an always-on computer to do Google
Cloud<00:01:03.510> Print<00:01:03.539> but<00:01:04.260> this<00:01:04.439> computer<00:01:04.619> just

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
Cloud Print but this computer just

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.219 
Cloud Print but this computer just
happens<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.339> be<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.790> Raspberry<00:01:06.330> Pi<00:01:06.390> nice<00:01:06.900> all

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
happens to be a Raspberry Pi nice all

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.539 
happens to be a Raspberry Pi nice all
right<00:01:07.290> so<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:07.860> Kyle<00:01:08.040> was<00:01:08.189> on<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.369> right<00:01:08.520> track

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
right so so Kyle was on the right track

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.280 
right so so Kyle was on the right track
with<00:01:09.060> having<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.420> coup<00:01:09.659> with<00:01:10.020> having<00:01:10.200> an

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
with having a coup with having an

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.719 
with having a coup with having an
always-on<00:01:10.619> computer<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.340> he<00:01:11.400> just<00:01:11.549> needs

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
always-on computer and he just needs

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.700 
always-on computer and he just needs
something<00:01:12.030> that's<00:01:12.060> low<00:01:12.420> powered<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.170> you

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
something that's low powered and you

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.080 
something that's low powered and you
know<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:14.280> can<00:01:14.400> even<00:01:14.490> take<00:01:14.700> that<00:01:14.820> with<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.000> on

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
know you can even take that with you on

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.940 
know you can even take that with you on
the<00:01:15.180> go<00:01:15.259> yeah<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.320> could<00:01:16.560> yes<00:01:17.750> but<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:19.020> the

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
the go yeah you could yes but this the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.620 
the go yeah you could yes but this the
setup<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.460> we're<00:01:20.549> going<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.700> do<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:21.180> actually

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
setup that we're going to do is actually

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.840 
setup that we're going to do is actually
you<00:01:22.560> have<00:01:22.740> this<00:01:22.920> hooked<00:01:23.310> into<00:01:23.549> your<00:01:23.670> network

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
you have this hooked into your network

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.520 
you have this hooked into your network
so<00:01:24.180> it's<00:01:24.299> always<00:01:24.570> on<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.170> way<00:01:25.259> Google

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
so it's always on and the way Google

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.740 
so it's always on and the way Google
Cloud<00:01:25.920> Print<00:01:25.950> works<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:26.909> once<00:01:27.600> you're

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
Cloud Print works is that once you're

printing<00:01:46.770> working<00:01:47.130> on<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.490> Raspberry<00:01:47.909> Pi

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
printing working on a Raspberry Pi

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.270 
printing working on a Raspberry Pi
because<00:01:48.590> when<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.619> was<00:01:49.770> going<00:01:49.979> through<00:01:50.130> this

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
because when I was going through this

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.920 
because when I was going through this
that<00:01:50.579> was<00:01:50.670> actually<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.240> most<00:01:51.390> difficult

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
that was actually the most difficult

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.539 
that was actually the most difficult
step<00:01:52.170> was<00:01:52.409> just<00:01:52.680> getting<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.159> printer

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
step was just getting the printer

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.940 
step was just getting the printer
working<00:01:54.540> which<00:01:54.960> has<00:01:55.229> nothing<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.649> do<00:01:55.740> with<00:01:55.829> the

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
working which has nothing to do with the

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.670 
working which has nothing to do with the
Raspberry<00:01:56.280> Pi<00:01:56.340> it's<00:01:56.670> just<00:01:57.229> Linux<00:01:58.229> is<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.409> little

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
Raspberry Pi it's just Linux is a little

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.789 
Raspberry Pi it's just Linux is a little
bit<00:01:58.799> harder<00:01:59.100> than<00:01:59.310> Oh<00:01:59.579> gotcha<00:02:00.180> yeah<00:02:00.780> okay<00:02:01.170> but

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
bit harder than Oh gotcha yeah okay but

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.249 
bit harder than Oh gotcha yeah okay but
so<00:02:02.100> check<00:02:02.790> out<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.030> how-to<00:02:03.450> geek<00:02:03.659> article<00:02:04.110> on

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
so check out the how-to geek article on

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.660 
so check out the how-to geek article on
how<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.469> do<00:02:04.619> that<00:02:04.770> basically<00:02:05.369> all<00:02:05.520> you're

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
how to do that basically all you're

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.600 
how to do that basically all you're
doing<00:02:05.909> is<00:02:06.030> installing<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.960> Cup's<00:02:07.610> printer

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
doing is installing the Cup's printer

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.919 
doing is installing the Cup's printer
package<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.300> then

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
package and then

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.839 
package and then
from<00:02:10.170> there<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:10.590> go<00:02:10.920> into<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.459> admin

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
from there you go into the admin

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.819 
from there you go into the admin
settings<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.599> then<00:02:12.780> add<00:02:13.079> the<00:02:13.349> printer<00:02:13.650> from

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:13.829 
settings and then add the printer from

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:16.039 
settings and then add the printer from
there<00:02:14.010> so<00:02:14.549> in<00:02:14.670> our<00:02:14.790> office<00:02:15.180> all<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.780> network

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
there so in our office all the network

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.670 
there so in our office all the network
printers<00:02:16.469> just<00:02:16.890> automatically<00:02:17.609> showed<00:02:18.209> up<00:02:18.680> so

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
printers just automatically showed up so

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.929 
printers just automatically showed up so
that<00:02:20.010> it<00:02:20.129> gives<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.459> option<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:20.849> then

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:20.939 
that it gives you the option and then

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:23.209 
that it gives you the option and then
you<00:02:21.030> just<00:02:21.239> add<00:02:21.390> them<00:02:21.629> from<00:02:21.840> there<00:02:22.140> and<00:02:23.040> then

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:23.219 
you just add them from there and then

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:25.240 
you just add them from there and then
like<00:02:23.340> select<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:23.819> right<00:02:23.939> driver<00:02:24.329> from<00:02:24.719> there

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
like select the right driver from there

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.649 
like select the right driver from there
so<00:02:26.250> once<00:02:26.489> those<00:02:26.790> are<00:02:26.849> set<00:02:26.969> up<00:02:27.209> and<00:02:27.359> once<00:02:27.540> you

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659 
so once those are set up and once you

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:30.170 
so once those are set up and once you
can<00:02:27.810> actually<00:02:28.139> print<00:02:28.439> to<00:02:28.799> the<00:02:29.489> printers<00:02:30.150> that

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
can actually print to the printers that

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.640 
can actually print to the printers that
you're<00:02:30.389> trying<00:02:30.569> to<00:02:30.659> do<00:02:30.810> then<00:02:31.290> you<00:02:31.439> want<00:02:31.590> to

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
you're trying to do then you want to

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.160 
you're trying to do then you want to
install<00:02:31.950> chromium<00:02:32.519> and<00:02:32.700> chromium<00:02:33.629> is<00:02:33.930> just

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
install chromium and chromium is just

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.379 
install chromium and chromium is just
like<00:02:34.349> the<00:02:34.620> open-source<00:02:35.189> version<00:02:35.310> of<00:02:35.760> coral

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:36.389 
like the open-source version of coral

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:39.500 
like the open-source version of coral
yeah<00:02:36.629> and<00:02:37.409> there's<00:02:37.909> already<00:02:38.909> built<00:02:39.120> package

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
yeah and there's already built package

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.300 
yeah and there's already built package
for<00:02:39.719> the<00:02:39.840> raspberry<00:02:40.200> pi<00:02:40.409> so<00:02:40.769> the<00:02:40.950> way<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:41.099> get

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
for the raspberry pi so the way you get

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.479 
for the raspberry pi so the way you get
that<00:02:41.489> is<00:02:41.700> you<00:02:41.730> do<00:02:41.939> sudo<00:02:42.540> apt-get<00:02:43.260> install

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
that is you do sudo apt-get install

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.500 
that is you do sudo apt-get install
chromium<00:02:44.489> and<00:02:44.700> then<00:02:44.909> that<00:02:45.030> downloads<00:02:45.419> the

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
chromium and then that downloads the

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.420 
chromium and then that downloads the
package<00:02:45.900> oh<00:02:46.049> downloaded<00:02:46.620> set<00:02:46.859> it<00:02:46.950> all<00:02:47.010> up<00:02:47.040> and

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
package oh downloaded set it all up and

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.190 
package oh downloaded set it all up and
then<00:02:47.730> from<00:02:48.000> there<00:02:48.209> you<00:02:48.359> want<00:02:48.389> to<00:02:48.629> open<00:02:49.109> up

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
then from there you want to open up

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.190 
then from there you want to open up
chromium<00:02:49.709> go<00:02:50.489> to<00:02:50.549> settings<00:02:51.239> advanced

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
chromium go to settings advanced

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
the printers that are already set up on

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.860 
the printers that are already set up on
your<00:03:04.590> Raspberry<00:03:05.069> Pi<00:03:05.099> and<00:03:05.489> then<00:03:06.000> add<00:03:06.239> that<00:03:06.569> to

your Raspberry Pi and then add that to

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.289 
your Raspberry Pi and then add that to
the<00:03:07.469> Google<00:03:07.769> Cloud<00:03:07.980> Print<00:03:08.010> service<00:03:08.819> I<00:03:09.030> don't

can use your phone tablet anywhere in
the<00:03:14.609> world<00:03:14.790> to<00:03:15.180> print<00:03:15.659> to<00:03:15.750> it<00:03:15.780> that<00:03:16.049> it'll<00:03:16.290> just

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
the world to print to it that it'll just

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.500 
the world to print to it that it'll just
automatically<00:03:17.069> show<00:03:17.340> up<00:03:17.489> as<00:03:17.669> an<00:03:17.940> option<00:03:18.329> right

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
automatically show up as an option right

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.349 
automatically show up as an option right
so<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.650> only<00:03:19.859> downside<00:03:20.609> to<00:03:20.639> this<00:03:20.849> is<00:03:21.060> not

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
so the only downside to this is not

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.990 
so the only downside to this is not
everything<00:03:21.870> can<00:03:22.349> print<00:03:23.069> to<00:03:23.159> Google<00:03:23.819> Cloud

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
everything can print to Google Cloud

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.899 
everything can print to Google Cloud
Print<00:03:24.030> like<00:03:24.750> so<00:03:25.470> you<00:03:25.560> have<00:03:25.769> to<00:03:25.949> use<00:03:26.159> we<00:03:26.760> did<00:03:26.879> a

daily tip on how to set it up for a
Windows<00:03:29.040> is<00:03:29.430> you<00:03:29.639> can<00:03:29.819> use<00:03:29.970> it<00:03:30.120> everywhere<00:03:30.599> but

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
Windows is you can use it everywhere but

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.379 
Windows is you can use it everywhere but
for<00:03:31.650> other<00:03:32.280> operating<00:03:32.669> systems<00:03:33.090> you<00:03:33.239> usually

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389 
for other operating systems you usually

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:35.539 
for other operating systems you usually
have<00:03:33.720> to<00:03:33.840> use<00:03:33.989> Chrome<00:03:34.439> so<00:03:34.949> prints<00:03:35.250> with<00:03:35.370> that

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
have to use Chrome so prints with that

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.909 
have to use Chrome so prints with that
or<00:03:35.939> like<00:03:36.449> on<00:03:36.599> Android<00:03:36.959> or<00:03:37.199> iOS<00:03:37.349> there<00:03:37.859> are

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:37.919 
or like on Android or iOS there are

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:40.189 
or like on Android or iOS there are
specific<00:03:38.400> apps<00:03:38.819> that<00:03:39.329> can<00:03:39.569> use<00:03:39.750> it<00:03:39.930> but

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:40.199 
specific apps that can use it but

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:41.539 
specific apps that can use it but
there's<00:03:40.409> a<00:03:40.470> whole<00:03:40.650> list<00:03:40.859> google<00:03:41.220> has<00:03:41.340> a<00:03:41.370> whole

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
there's a whole list google has a whole

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.149 
there's a whole list google has a whole
list<00:03:41.729> on<00:03:41.970> what<00:03:42.540> is<00:03:42.750> actually<00:03:43.139> compatible<00:03:43.680> yeah

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 
list on what is actually compatible yeah

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:45.170 
list on what is actually compatible yeah
I've<00:03:44.280> been<00:03:44.400> able<00:03:44.489> to<00:03:44.609> use<00:03:44.729> it<00:03:44.849> for<00:03:44.939> my<00:03:45.030> iPhone

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
I've been able to use it for my iPhone

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.740 
I've been able to use it for my iPhone
pretty<00:03:46.079> regularly<00:03:46.530> and<00:03:46.919> it<00:03:47.189> works<00:03:47.340> fine<00:03:47.759> and

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
pretty regularly and it works fine and

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.240 
pretty regularly and it works fine and
I'm<00:03:48.870> assuming<00:03:49.109> Android<00:03:49.680> is<00:03:49.799> just<00:03:49.979> this<00:03:50.069> easy

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
I'm assuming Android is just this easy

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.849 
I'm assuming Android is just this easy
yes<00:03:50.819> like<00:03:51.030> since<00:03:51.269> baked<00:03:51.479> right<00:03:51.689> in<00:03:51.870> but<00:03:52.739> it

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
yes like since baked right in but it
