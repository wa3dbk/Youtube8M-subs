that are really specific to so maybe
problem<00:00:23.210> areas<00:00:23.570> in<00:00:23.600> our<00:00:23.779> darkness<00:00:24.140> we<00:00:24.410> do<00:00:24.560> I

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
problem areas in our darkness we do I

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.439 
problem areas in our darkness we do I
could<00:00:24.949> ask<00:00:25.189> all<00:00:25.609> the<00:00:25.730> time<00:00:25.760> it's<00:00:26.210> like<00:00:26.300> you

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:26.449

know<00:00:26.570> I<00:00:26.720> have<00:00:26.990> this<00:00:27.170> area<00:00:27.470> that<00:00:27.740> I<00:00:27.769> don't<00:00:28.130> know

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
know I have this area that I don't know

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.669 
know I have this area that I don't know
what<00:00:28.490> will<00:00:29.090> grow<00:00:29.210> in<00:00:29.449> so<00:00:29.779> figured<00:00:30.380> it's<00:00:30.500> kind

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679 
what will grow in so figured it's kind

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:31.960 
what will grow in so figured it's kind
of<00:00:30.710> a<00:00:30.769> good<00:00:30.890> time<00:00:31.099> to<00:00:31.250> show<00:00:31.279> some<00:00:31.789> of<00:00:31.880> those

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
of a good time to show some of those

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.060 
of a good time to show some of those
different<00:00:32.330> harder<00:00:32.570> areas<00:00:32.960> to<00:00:33.110> do<00:00:33.260> and<00:00:33.560> what

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070

grows in the shade so I picked out some
sampling<00:01:06.740> of<00:01:06.830> plants<00:01:07.160> that<00:01:07.250> we<00:01:07.310> can<00:01:07.460> do<00:01:07.580> for

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.120 
sampling of plants that we can do for

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.610 
sampling of plants that we can do for
that<00:01:08.240> area<00:01:08.420> also<00:01:08.600> right<00:01:08.990> well<00:01:09.200> maybe<00:01:09.320> you<00:01:09.470> can

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
walls and experimented with them there

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.230 
walls and experimented with them there
and<00:05:39.920> they've<00:05:40.040> done<00:05:40.220> very<00:05:40.250> well<00:05:40.730> in<00:05:40.880> that<00:05:41.030> also
