absorb<00:00:34.079> up<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.820> let<00:00:35.820> me<00:00:35.940> know<00:00:37.130> so<00:00:38.130> 30<00:00:38.610> minutes

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
absorb up and let me know so 30 minutes

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.170 
absorb up and let me know so 30 minutes
here<00:00:39.360> we<00:00:39.450> go<00:00:42.380> obviously<00:00:43.380> the<00:00:43.470> key<00:00:43.650> is<00:00:43.740> floats

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
here we go obviously the key is floats

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:56.210 
here we go obviously the key is floats
so<00:00:45.180> we<00:00:45.600> will<00:00:45.780> wear<00:00:46.170> down<00:00:46.200> in<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.620> class<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:55.220> 938

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.220 
so we will wear down in the class I 938

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.460 
so we will wear down in the class I 938
so<00:00:57.000> we'll<00:00:57.210> come<00:00:57.360> back<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.780> approximately<00:00:58.380> it

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:58.470 
so we'll come back and approximately it

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.710

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.170 
it hasn't popped it hasn't come up this
surface<00:01:25.340> other<00:01:26.340> than<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:26.940> haven't

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
surface other than that I haven't

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.219 
surface other than that I haven't
noticed<00:01:27.630> anything<00:01:27.900> would<00:01:28.080> have<00:01:28.200> been

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
noticed anything would have been

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.930 
noticed anything would have been
checking<00:01:28.740> on<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:30.509> time<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:31.790> take<00:01:32.790> the

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
checking on it and so time to take the

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.440 
checking on it and so time to take the
TA<00:01:33.150> site<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.720> see<00:01:34.080> how<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.500> furred<00:01:36.590> floats

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
TA site and see how it is furred floats

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.779 
TA site and see how it is furred floats
that's<00:01:39.450> certainly<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.869> good<00:01:39.990> thing<00:01:43.369> and<00:01:44.369> what<00:01:44.759> I

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
that's certainly a good thing and what I

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.999 
that's certainly a good thing and what I
will<00:01:45.000> do<00:01:45.119> now<00:01:45.149> is<00:01:46.520> I'll<00:01:47.520> just<00:01:47.700> dry<00:01:47.910> it<00:01:47.940> off<00:01:48.149> and

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
will do now is I'll just dry it off and
