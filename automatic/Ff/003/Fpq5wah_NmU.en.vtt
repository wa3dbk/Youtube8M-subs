00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.950
 and so guys hello everyone with you wrong with 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.950
 the slopes of street demage and now we will consider 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:15.470
 tank speed 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:20.220
 stb-1 new japanese are level 10 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:25.699
 compare it with the leopard first for now 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.699
 moment this is just the first test here and 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.880
 Now we will see how leopard 1 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:39.750
 faster 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:42.540
 stb 1 graphics in the game now 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:48.390
 great but when recording video she 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:51.300
 podlagivaet because the game no not drag 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:56.010
 On maximal press as she because 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:58.829
 not stabilized now who will you 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.739
 watch you help me bayonet yes yes yes 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:06.390
 hello tankers with you 40 thousand 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:09.630
 meet here and pack your butts 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.510
 this barn can we get up now 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.080
 like i said here and so you 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:19.549
 let's go and start I don't want to go ahead 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:25.189
 let's speed up this process a little bit 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:28.590
 let's see here we got up so here 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:31.200
 slightly but higher yes only higher yes 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.909
 under the dimensions more so 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:39.150
 get up quietly get up all right asses to 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:42.840
 it's all got up and that means one-two-three 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:50.189
 press w do not press p because it will 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:54.890
 for a long time then change one or two times and when we 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.890
 click w 1 2 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:04.660
 as you see at the beginning and if 1 were very 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.480
 accelerates quickly and even takes a leopard 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:10.179
 1 in revolutions here the leopard lost 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:14.020
 a little revolutions in a collision 162 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.610
 but this significant one 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.280
 small workers from the hill 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.290
 gave him a huge overclocking and look 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:27.880
 what a furious speed he rushes and 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:31.690
 overtaking us here next I want to show 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:34.680
 you one more moment we will move out with 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.600
 slides and how we will rise under it 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:42.280
 here again, the same jerk I take 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:45.160
 speed but descent from the hill gives the leopard 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:49.209
 much greater advantage and he 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:53.980
 rushing forward once a second me and me 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:03:02.680
 about 23 meters now we turn around 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:06.630
 and do the same from this side here 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.630
 now we will do this thing 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:27.040
 here lagano leopard to server 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:30.610
 a little more syllables here or a greenhouse 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:34.050
 does stb-1 uphill but no longer 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.050
 as much as we see 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:43.680
 one more thing we checked here 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:47.040
 how strong is the stb-1 tower 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:51.500
 and how can I tank corners 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:55.380
 Vertical pickup is wonderful but 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:58.130
 furious but we get through here 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:06.300
 see us 1819 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:09.780
 now our come out i'm just i'm just here 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.820
 listen to this mod is not used to mod 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.780
 here and here the river network he was lucky 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.780
 try to punch me 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:22.260
 its exact gun and that we do not pret 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:26.280
 Yes, we do not sing as it was given in 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:30.960
 tower me punch target passed without 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.580
 damage I am an attempt at a lady he shoots me in 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.710
 flap 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:37.830
 here and give break through triplex duron 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.690
 a lot and here it is as big as it is 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.990
 that we have a good tower try me in 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:45.900
 the tower does not punch in 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:48.600
 not in the commander but just a bank here 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:56.190
 see and how he does not flash us 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:58.740
 yourself and you pray to you even in the turret here 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.380
 she's not breaking here this one more 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:06.350
 Now he will pass on us and he will not lead 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:11.030
 he punches us in the tower so much 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.030
 here in this huge commander's hatch 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:21.110
 that's all about the stb-1 review at speed on 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:21.860
 strength tower is over all thanks 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.910
 who watched 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.910
 good luck on the battlefield
