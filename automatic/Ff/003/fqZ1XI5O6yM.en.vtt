00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 for years everyone has been 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.629
 invaded by junk food being 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.400
 instant soups the most sought after 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.790
 and consumed for the convenience of having 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.740
 a complete meal in quotation marks 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.630
 quickly brands and 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.510
 maruchan became synonymous with 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.880
 instant soup actually all are 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.670
 same and it does not matter the brand they are all 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.800
 bad for your health and I'll tell you why 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:28.080
 the instant soups are the worst thing that 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.910
 you can eat and it's that these are 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.120
 full of chemical dyes 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.280
 flavors too much salt in the extreme and 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.340
 an additive that is a real poison the 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.860
 feared monosodium glutamate if you do not know 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.930
 what is monosodium glutamate get ready 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.780
 so you can hear what this poison is 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.910
 and it's nothing more and nothing less than a 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.100
 additive used to give more flavor to 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.410
 industrialized foods like 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.500
 chicken broths in cubes sauces 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.109
 fried tomato cubes and soups 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.910
 snapshots in the 60s it 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.309
 popularized a brand seasoning 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.890
 ajinomoto that was used as salt in all 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.540
 the food was removed from the market 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.790
 upon discovering that it was high 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.330
 carcinogen was monosodium glutamate 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.250
 pure then the industrial what 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.200
 they started using combined with others 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.230
 additives to season food 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.150
 industrialized but what is it that 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:24.330
 happens to your body when you ingest it 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.550
 crap is simple in restaurants 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.500
 of Chinese or Japanese food discovered 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.900
 that some clients started to suffer 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.000
 various disorders that affected them 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.490
 health and that was known as the syndrome 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.590
 of the Chinese restaurant and that consisted of 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.200
 headaches irritation in the eyes 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.380
 blurred vision tachycardia sweating 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.229
 excessive itching widespread diarrhea and 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.840
 asthma among other symptoms studies 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.390
 doctors found that the gms had a 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.950
 toxic effect on nerve cells and 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.050
 that favored obesity and 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.420
 sterility and in some cases 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.180
 found that glutamate favored 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.250
 the appearance of cancer cells is 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.310
 say the innocent soups maruchan 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.500
 can cause asthma and cancer that 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.660
 assuming the soups were heated 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.730
 in the stove removing the ones from their containers 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.260
 plastics and placing them in pots or 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.810
 metal or clay pans 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.390
 but the worst was later discovered at 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.250
 warm how you almost always do 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.349
 soup in its polyethylene container and in 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.930
 microwave oven plastic 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:27.780
 loose container dioxins or toxins 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.060
 that cause cancer the industry 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.459

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.500
