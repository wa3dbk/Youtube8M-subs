00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.440

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.210
 I had here you have me again 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:12.400
 doing is a video directly from 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:14.410
 my channel twice 66 on youtube 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.160
 and that helped all my subscribers 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:21.220
 the same without odors also because you do not 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:24.250
 I say subscribe to my good channel the 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:28.210
 today's video is going to address the issue is how 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.279
 we can change in windows 8 good how 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.559
 we can play our music 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.379
 with the classic windows player 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:37.150
 mean since when you're in windows 8 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.850
 by default he will send you to this 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.800
 application that is music that is I want 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.020
 an application with Xbox Live you 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.750
 went bankrupt around 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.730
 how can you see if you are from 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.910
 The missing their player 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:55.090
 windows media here is the way how 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:58.680
 do it or fix it is 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.680
 because no conflict there 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:05.449
 and we go to our music 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.430
 and as you can see it has a very icon 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.360
 different from windows media of 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.160
 player how to do right click 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.230
 properties we are going to change if 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.950
 we only put the player 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.950
 windows media 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.100
 and how they automatically see everyone already 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:26.210
 change and it's going to be reproduced by 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.120
 of funk and windows media 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:34.270
 be the producer of windows 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.270
 let's run with discount 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.799
 is 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.189
 let's close this 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.240
 how can you see 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:58.030
 you already play it from my player 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:02.530
 of windows average normal the classic 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:05.350
 all the times then it is not to say a 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.270
 austral video very short very basic yes 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.119
 you write take is more exclusively for 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.410
 those people who are barely 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.290
 getting a little bit into what is in 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:17.430
 those in operating systems or what if 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.430
 he gave you his first computer 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.770
 since this can do it is the same 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.740
 can do in windows vista windows 7 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.580
 xp 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.080
 and here then there are several conflicts and 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.800
 when you install a player that does not 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.890
 be this one 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:39.630
 how to do whatever it takes to make it the 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:43.150
 default producer for 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:48.150
