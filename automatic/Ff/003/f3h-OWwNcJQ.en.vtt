00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.170
 to be met clock I had scheduled 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.089
 I enjoyed coming here and it made us 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.690
 enjoy us the afternoon I think 

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:13.580
 the biggest laughter in these years the 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.369
 we share thanks to the follies to the 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:20.180
 subtleties to that football game that 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:22.640
 I imagined that we never played the good ones and 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.130
 for tributes obviously and everything for him 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.900

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.369
 have a bad day or at least we 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.869

 he always smiled he always went up 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.109
 I think the best way to 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.149
 remember it since there were a lot of 

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:37.489
 people who remembered him during all this 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.079
