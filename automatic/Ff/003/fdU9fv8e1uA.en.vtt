theme so for example when they're a dolt
dog<00:02:10.009> if<00:02:10.160> you<00:02:10.220> create<00:02:10.550> an<00:02:10.670> adult<00:02:10.970> dog<00:02:11.209> you<00:02:11.630> can

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
dog if you create an adult dog you can

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.840

aggressive<00:02:16.190> or<00:02:17.020> lazy<00:02:18.020> or<00:02:18.610> piggish<00:02:19.610> so<00:02:19.940> they

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
aggressive or lazy or piggish so they

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.120

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
choice the same way you do when you

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:41.150 
choice the same way you do when you
create<00:03:36.139> a<00:03:36.170> human<00:03:36.319> suit

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.150 

the<00:03:41.400> Kinect<00:03:41.940> is<00:03:42.300> a<00:03:42.630> fantastic<00:03:43.380> new<00:03:43.860> feature

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
the Kinect is a fantastic new feature

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.490 
the Kinect is a fantastic new feature
which<00:03:44.520> allows<00:03:44.550> you<00:03:45.090> to<00:03:45.330> navigate<00:03:45.540> using<00:03:46.200> your

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
which allows you to navigate using your

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.000 
which allows you to navigate using your
voice<00:03:46.710> and<00:03:47.100> so<00:03:47.760> you<00:03:48.390> can<00:03:48.540> use<00:03:48.780> it<00:03:48.810> to<00:03:49.170> call<00:03:49.800> up

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
voice and so you can use it to call up

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.280 
voice and so you can use it to call up
social<00:03:50.400> interactions<00:03:51.030> that<00:03:51.300> you<00:03:51.420> cue<00:03:51.660> up<00:03:51.690> you

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
social interactions that you cue up you

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.990 
social interactions that you cue up you
can<00:03:52.410> also<00:03:52.530> use<00:03:52.680> it<00:03:52.890> to<00:03:52.920> switch<00:03:53.220> between<00:03:53.370> Sims

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
can also use it to switch between Sims

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.050 
can also use it to switch between Sims
and<00:03:54.360> so<00:03:54.990> it<00:03:55.170> frees<00:03:55.920> you<00:03:56.130> up<00:03:56.190> to<00:03:56.550> not<00:03:56.700> have<00:03:56.910> to

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
and so it frees you up to not have to

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.450 
and so it frees you up to not have to
spend<00:03:57.150> so<00:03:57.420> much<00:03:57.570> time<00:03:57.830> navigating<00:03:58.830> through

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460 
spend so much time navigating through

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:04.430 
spend so much time navigating through
the<00:03:59.520> UI

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440
