spending<00:01:15.000> entire<00:01:15.630> summers<00:01:16.230> you<00:01:16.830> know<00:01:16.980> playing

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
spending entire summers you know playing

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.590 
spending entire summers you know playing
over<00:01:18.290> you<00:01:19.290> know<00:01:19.410> something<00:01:19.800> like<00:01:23.600> something

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
over you know something like something

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.490 
over you know something like something
like<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:26.360> recorded<00:01:27.360> on<00:01:27.480> my<00:01:27.630> Panasonic

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
like that and recorded on my Panasonic

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.760 
like that and recorded on my Panasonic
tape<00:01:28.740> deck<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.940> I<00:01:30.450> played<00:01:30.780> look<00:01:31.260> at<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.440> clock

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
tape deck and I played look at the clock

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.320 
tape deck and I played look at the clock
because<00:01:31.800> it<00:01:32.190> always<00:01:32.340> seemed<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.730> you<00:01:33.210> know<00:01:33.300> I

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
because it always seemed that you know I

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.760 
because it always seemed that you know I
think<00:01:33.450> oh<00:01:33.720> well<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:33.960> played<00:01:34.230> rhythm<00:01:34.440> long

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
think oh well I played rhythm long

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.830 
think oh well I played rhythm long
enough<00:01:35.070> but<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:36.180> know<00:01:36.300> it's<00:01:36.450> only<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.690> couple

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
enough but you know it's only a couple

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.360 
enough but you know it's only a couple
minutes<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:37.350> I'd<00:01:37.500> make<00:01:37.680> sure<00:01:37.830> there<00:01:38.010> were<00:01:38.100> five

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 
minutes so I'd make sure there were five

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.570 
minutes so I'd make sure there were five
minutes<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.530> and<00:01:40.530> that's<00:01:40.770> how<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.130> learned<00:01:41.460> how

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
minutes and and that's how I learned how

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.680 
minutes and and that's how I learned how
to<00:01:41.640> improvise<00:01:42.120> I've<00:01:42.690> used<00:01:43.110> certain<00:01:44.100> looping

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
to improvise I've used certain looping

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.310 
to improvise I've used certain looping
gizmos<00:01:45.740> at<00:01:46.740> home<00:01:47.130> if<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:48.450> want<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.900> learn<00:01:49.020> how<00:01:49.290> to

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
gizmos at home if I want to learn how to

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.650 
gizmos at home if I want to learn how to
play<00:01:49.619> over<00:01:50.010> Stella<00:01:50.670> by<00:01:50.850> starlight<00:01:50.880> or

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:51.660 
play over Stella by starlight or

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.800 
play over Stella by starlight or
whatever<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.400> loop<00:01:53.400> it<00:01:53.610> when<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.119> give<00:01:54.450> lessons

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
whatever I loop it when I give lessons

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
whatever I loop it when I give lessons
and<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.880> person<00:01:57.140> tells<00:01:58.140> me<00:01:58.410> they<00:01:58.560> don't<00:01:58.710> know

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
and a person tells me they don't know

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.980 
and a person tells me they don't know
how<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.070> improvise<00:01:59.460> or<00:02:00.000> they've<00:02:00.479> been<00:02:00.509> playing

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
how to improvise or they've been playing

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.280 
how to improvise or they've been playing
guitar<00:02:01.110> for<00:02:01.350> 15<00:02:02.340> years<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:02.910> they<00:02:03.720> they<00:02:04.170> don't

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
guitar for 15 years that they they don't

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.080 
guitar for 15 years that they they don't
know<00:02:04.440> how<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.590> really<00:02:04.800> play<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.400> if<00:02:05.700> they<00:02:05.880> know

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
know how to really play and if they know

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:13.910 
know how to really play and if they know
this<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:11.540> always<00:02:12.540> say<00:02:12.900> well<00:02:13.140> you<00:02:13.410> you<00:02:13.680> know

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
this I always say well you you know

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.160 
this I always say well you you know
enough<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.730> be<00:02:14.850> a<00:02:15.030> great<00:02:15.360> artist<00:02:15.570> I<00:02:15.959> mean

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
enough to be a great artist I mean

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.070 
enough to be a great artist I mean
Albert<00:02:16.709> King<00:02:17.010> probably<00:02:17.340> used<00:02:17.700> a<00:02:18.269> third<00:02:18.870> of

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
Albert King probably used a third of

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:26.570 
Albert King probably used a third of
that<00:02:19.110> but<00:02:19.680> if<00:02:19.830> something's<00:02:20.370> going<00:02:25.370> all<00:02:26.370> the

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
that but if something's going all the

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.750 
that but if something's going all the
sudden<00:02:27.030> this<00:02:27.989> is<00:02:28.769> going<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.070> be<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.220> multitude

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
sudden this is going to be a multitude

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.490 
sudden this is going to be a multitude
of<00:02:31.670> decisions<00:02:32.670> and<00:02:32.940> options<00:02:33.209> of<00:02:33.750> touch<00:02:34.110> and

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
of decisions and options of touch and

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.520 
of decisions and options of touch and
repetition<00:02:35.280> etc<00:02:35.850> etc<00:02:35.910> so<00:02:36.390> I<00:02:36.600> think<00:02:36.870> it's<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.350> way

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
repetition etc etc so I think it's a way

00:02:37.530 --> 00:03:13.149 
repetition etc etc so I think it's a way
to<00:02:37.590> for<00:02:38.220> people<00:02:38.519> to<00:02:38.670> learn

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:13.159 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:15.530 

and<00:03:14.159> then<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.549> other<00:03:14.700> reason<00:03:15.090> was<00:03:15.209> you<00:03:15.390> asked

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
and then the other reason was you asked

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.050 
and then the other reason was you asked
me<00:03:15.780> to<00:03:16.230> do<00:03:16.379> a<00:03:16.409> loop<00:03:16.709> and<00:03:17.010> I<00:03:17.220> found<00:03:17.819> that<00:03:18.000> a

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
me to do a loop and I found that a

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.600 
me to do a loop and I found that a
challenge<00:03:18.420> and<00:03:19.019> of<00:03:19.470> course<00:03:19.769> I'm<00:03:20.010> happy<00:03:20.220> to<00:03:20.459> get

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
challenge and of course I'm happy to get

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.430 
challenge and of course I'm happy to get
my<00:03:20.730> music<00:03:20.790> out<00:03:21.269> there<00:03:21.330> you<00:03:21.870> know<00:03:22.019> and<00:03:22.290> have

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
my music out there you know and have

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.559 
my music out there you know and have
people<00:03:22.769> hear<00:03:23.010> my<00:03:23.190> music<00:03:23.670> hopefully<00:03:24.150> be

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
people hear my music hopefully be

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.890 
people hear my music hopefully be
inspired<00:03:25.049> by<00:03:25.379> it<00:03:25.409> then<00:03:26.370> maybe<00:03:26.849> maybe<00:03:27.269> go<00:03:27.780> out

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
inspired by it then maybe maybe go out

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.350 
inspired by it then maybe maybe go out
and<00:03:28.019> buy<00:03:28.140> it<00:03:28.200> well<00:03:28.980> one<00:03:29.280> of<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:29.519> things<00:03:29.819> that

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.039 

sounded<00:03:33.360> appealing<00:03:33.959> is<00:03:34.110> this<00:03:34.290> isn't<00:03:34.700> like<00:03:36.049> you

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
sounded appealing is this isn't like you

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.470 
sounded appealing is this isn't like you
know<00:03:37.200> like<00:03:37.379> a<00:03:37.409> karaoke<00:03:37.799> track<00:03:38.579> and<00:03:38.849> we've<00:03:39.209> got
