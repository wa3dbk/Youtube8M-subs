00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
necessarily get that when you're just

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.259 
necessarily get that when you're just
looking<00:00:21.090> at<00:00:21.300> at<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.170> painting<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:23.519> I<00:00:24.000> think

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
looking at at the painting and I think

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.419 
looking at at the painting and I think
also<00:00:26.660> you<00:00:27.660> know<00:00:27.779> he<00:00:27.990> it's<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.769> it's<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.160> little

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
also you know he it's a it's a little

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.790 
also you know he it's a it's a little
bit<00:00:29.609> of<00:00:29.929> it's<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:31.080> little<00:00:31.289> bit<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.529> struggle

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
bit of it's a little bit of a struggle

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.930 
bit of it's a little bit of a struggle
for<00:00:31.949> him<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.309> sort<00:00:32.489> of<00:00:32.610> come<00:00:32.790> up<00:00:32.910> with

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
for him to sort of come up with

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.240 
for him to sort of come up with
completely<00:00:33.420> new<00:00:33.660> ideas<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:34.530> think<00:00:34.590> his<00:00:34.829> ideas

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
completely new ideas I think his ideas

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.270 
completely new ideas I think his ideas
are<00:00:35.460> sort<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.790> always<00:00:35.969> in<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.690> similar<00:00:37.170> vein<00:00:37.469> you

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
are sort of always in a similar vein you

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.670 
are sort of always in a similar vein you
know<00:00:38.370> but<00:00:38.550> he's<00:00:38.910> always<00:00:39.120> at<00:00:39.390> an<00:00:40.110> issue<00:00:40.260> in<00:00:40.559> the

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
know but he's always at an issue in the

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.650 
know but he's always at an issue in the
u.s.<00:00:41.010> with<00:00:41.250> really<00:00:41.520> sort<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.879> categorizing

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
u.s. with really sort of categorizing

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.610 
u.s. with really sort of categorizing
his<00:00:43.079> art<00:00:43.550> or<00:00:44.550> comparing<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.450> other<00:00:45.620> you

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
his art or comparing it to other you

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.410 
his art or comparing it to other you
know<00:00:46.739> hard<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.190> doesn't<00:00:47.579> necessarily<00:00:48.059> fit<00:00:48.239> in

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
know hard it doesn't necessarily fit in

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.350 
know hard it doesn't necessarily fit in
a<00:00:48.739> genre<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.219> it's<00:00:50.489> sort<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.820> cross<00:00:51.090> between

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
a genre and it's sort of a cross between

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.310 
a genre and it's sort of a cross between
a<00:00:51.600> lot<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.379> lot<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.219> artistic<00:00:53.699> styles<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.809> he

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
a lot of a lot of artistic styles and he

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.080 
a lot of a lot of artistic styles and he
said<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.530> hard<00:00:55.770> time<00:00:55.980> selling<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.520> think<00:00:56.730> because

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
said a hard time selling I think because

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.660 
said a hard time selling I think because
of<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.390> in<00:00:57.660> Japan<00:00:58.410> I<00:00:58.440> mean<00:00:58.859> he<00:00:58.949> has<00:00:59.100> sort<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.489> he

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
of it in Japan I mean he has sort of he

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.790 
of it in Japan I mean he has sort of he
has<00:00:59.760> pieces<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.449> museums<00:01:01.230> all<00:01:01.500> over<00:01:01.530> the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
has pieces and museums all over the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.070 
has pieces and museums all over the
country<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:03.120> his<00:01:03.420> earlier<00:01:03.840> work

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
country and so his earlier work

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.120 
country and so his earlier work
obviously<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:05.510> more<00:01:06.510> prized<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.470> he<00:01:07.950> was<00:01:08.100> a

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
obviously is more prized and he was a

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.490 
obviously is more prized and he was a
member<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.760> this<00:01:09.060> really<00:01:09.360> prominent<00:01:09.780> post-war
