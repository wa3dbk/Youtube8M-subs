going to have a white border in the
layout<00:01:59.030> when<00:02:00.030> we<00:02:00.240> get<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.540> that<00:02:00.689> layout<00:02:01.369> page

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
layout when we get to that layout page

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.200 
layout when we get to that layout page
it<00:02:03.240> would<00:02:03.390> include<00:02:03.780> anything<00:02:05.090> it<00:02:06.090> would

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
include the document area as well so you

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.300
