so<00:03:07.880> the<00:03:08.030> must<00:03:08.270> most<00:03:08.660> successful<00:03:09.350> species<00:03:09.650> are

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
so the must most successful species are

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.660 
so the must most successful species are
those<00:03:11.000> that<00:03:11.350> mutate<00:03:12.350> very<00:03:12.710> quickly<00:03:13.070> like

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
those that mutate very quickly like

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.590 
those that mutate very quickly like
bacteria<00:03:14.510> or<00:03:15.230> those<00:03:15.740> that<00:03:16.040> have<00:03:16.100> a<00:03:16.600> fixed

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
bacteria or those that have a fixed

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.370 
bacteria or those that have a fixed
ecological<00:03:18.470> niche<00:03:19.040> like<00:03:19.510> beetles<00:03:20.510> they<00:03:21.320> do

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
ecological niche like beetles they do

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.970 
ecological niche like beetles they do
very<00:03:21.920> well<00:03:22.160> no<00:03:22.580> matter<00:03:22.790> what<00:03:23.120> happens<00:03:23.930> and<00:03:24.260> as

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
very well no matter what happens and as

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.850 
very well no matter what happens and as
you<00:03:25.160> move<00:03:25.430> up<00:03:25.460> the<00:03:25.700> scale<00:03:26.270> of<00:03:26.630> what<00:03:27.470> we<00:03:27.620> call

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
you move up the scale of what we call

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.750 
you move up the scale of what we call
intelligence<00:03:28.480> the<00:03:29.480> survival<00:03:30.140> becomes<00:03:30.760> much

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
intelligence the survival becomes much

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.490 
intelligence the survival becomes much
more<00:03:32.290> hazardous<00:03:33.340> among<00:03:34.340> mammals<00:03:35.410> there<00:03:36.410> are

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
more hazardous among mammals there are

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.480 
more hazardous among mammals there are
actually<00:03:36.800> very<00:03:37.010> few<00:03:37.100> of<00:03:37.520> them<00:03:37.840> and<00:03:39.430> there<00:03:40.430> are

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
actually very few of them and there are

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.160 
actually very few of them and there are
a<00:03:40.550> lot<00:03:40.640> of<00:03:40.670> cows<00:03:41.090> but<00:03:41.570> that's<00:03:41.780> only<00:03:41.959> because

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
a lot of cows but that's only because

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.770 
a lot of cows but that's only because
humans<00:03:42.740> domesticate<00:03:43.430> them<00:03:43.670> just<00:03:44.450> as<00:03:44.600> there

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
humans domesticate them just as there

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.300 
humans domesticate them just as there
are<00:03:44.810> a<00:03:44.870> lot<00:03:44.959> of<00:03:45.080> chickens<00:03:45.530> for<00:03:45.860> the<00:03:46.100> same

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
are a lot of chickens for the same

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.260 
are a lot of chickens for the same
reason<00:03:46.730> but<00:03:47.950> survival<00:03:48.950> on<00:03:49.070> their<00:03:49.190> own<00:03:49.370> is<00:03:49.700> that

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
reason but survival on their own is that

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.210 
reason but survival on their own is that
they<00:03:50.390> don't<00:03:50.570> do<00:03:50.750> very<00:03:50.780> well<00:03:51.080> when<00:03:51.950> you<00:03:52.010> get<00:03:52.160> to

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
they don't do very well when you get to

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:58.180 
they don't do very well when you get to
primates<00:03:52.910> there<00:03:53.540> are<00:03:53.660> very<00:03:53.959> few<00:03:55.780> humans<00:03:57.190> have

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
primates there are very few humans have

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.330 
primates there are very few humans have
been<00:03:58.459> very<00:03:58.940> sparsely<00:03:59.750> have<00:04:00.470> been<00:04:00.650> very<00:04:00.890> sparse

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
been very sparsely have been very sparse

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.880 
been very sparsely have been very sparse
throughout<00:04:01.760> the<00:04:01.970> world<00:04:02.150> until<00:04:02.630> very<00:04:03.350> recently

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
throughout the world until very recently

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.120 
throughout the world until very recently
so<00:04:04.010> reasons<00:04:04.820> that<00:04:05.350> doesn't<00:04:06.350> mean<00:04:06.530> anything<00:04:06.980> in

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
so reasons that doesn't mean anything in

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.780 
so reasons that doesn't mean anything in
evolutionary<00:04:07.910> terms<00:04:08.890> he<00:04:09.890> also<00:04:10.070> pointed<00:04:10.640> out

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
evolutionary terms he also pointed out

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.530 
evolutionary terms he also pointed out
that<00:04:11.120> the<00:04:11.420> average<00:04:12.640> life

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
that the average life

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.660 
that the average life
expectancy<00:04:16.540> for<00:04:16.810> a<00:04:16.840> species<00:04:17.140> is<00:04:17.640> roughly<00:04:18.640> a

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:18.670 
expectancy for a species is roughly a

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.990 
expectancy for a species is roughly a
hundred<00:04:18.880> thousand<00:04:19.540> years<00:04:20.160> rather<00:04:21.160> ominously

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
hundred thousand years rather ominously

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.020 
hundred thousand years rather ominously
that's<00:04:22.390> about<00:04:22.780> how<00:04:23.050> long<00:04:23.380> it's<00:04:23.680> been<00:04:23.800> that

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
that's about how long it's been that

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.660 
that's about how long it's been that
Homo<00:04:25.030> sapiens<00:04:25.510> has<00:04:25.750> been<00:04:25.990> on<00:04:26.140> earth<00:04:26.520> so<00:04:27.520> his

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670 
Homo sapiens has been on earth so his

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.260 
Homo sapiens has been on earth so his
conclusion<00:04:28.300> is<00:04:28.510> that<00:04:30.090> intelligence<00:04:31.090> is

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
conclusion is that intelligence is

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.650 
conclusion is that intelligence is
basically<00:04:31.780> a<00:04:31.930> lethal<00:04:32.440> mutation<00:04:33.120> as<00:04:34.120> you<00:04:34.450> move

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
basically a lethal mutation as you move

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.530 
basically a lethal mutation as you move
up<00:04:34.870> to<00:04:35.140> greater<00:04:35.650> intelligence<00:04:36.330> there's<00:04:37.330> more

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
up to greater intelligence there's more

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.680 
up to greater intelligence there's more
and<00:04:37.630> more<00:04:37.920> self-destruction<00:04:38.920> and<00:04:39.490> it<00:04:40.120> you

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
and more self-destruction and it you

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.750 
and more self-destruction and it you
could<00:04:40.900> this<00:04:41.640> extraterrestrial<00:04:42.640> observer

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
could this extraterrestrial observer

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.300 
could this extraterrestrial observer
might<00:04:43.480> argue<00:04:44.110> that<00:04:44.140> we're<00:04:44.530> trying<00:04:44.800> to<00:04:45.040> prove

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
might argue that we're trying to prove

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.290 
might argue that we're trying to prove
that<00:04:45.780> Maier<00:04:46.780> was<00:04:46.810> correct<00:04:48.090> certainly<00:04:49.090> what<00:04:49.270> it

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
that Maier was correct certainly what it

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.810 
that Maier was correct certainly what it
looks<00:04:49.570> like
