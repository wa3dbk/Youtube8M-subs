I<00:01:13.580> start<00:01:14.580> by<00:01:14.640> filleting<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.689> chicken

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
I start by filleting the chicken

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.580 
I start by filleting the chicken
horizontally<00:01:17.240> then<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.330> place<00:01:18.600> each<00:01:18.810> breast<00:01:19.320> of

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
horizontally then I place each breast of

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.740 
horizontally then I place each breast of
chicken<00:01:19.850> between<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.880> folded<00:01:21.390> sheet<00:01:21.630> of

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
chicken between a folded sheet of

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.160 
chicken between a folded sheet of
parchment<00:01:21.990> paper<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.799> pound<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.670> thin<00:01:24.170> this

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
parchment paper and pound it thin this

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.360 
parchment paper and pound it thin this
makes<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.560> chicken<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:26.130> much<00:01:26.159> more<00:01:26.580> tender

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.780

two<00:01:33.970> pieces<00:01:34.530> they're<00:01:35.530> easier<00:01:35.920> to<00:01:36.040> cook<00:01:36.220> this

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
more reasonable salt and pepper each

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.840 
more reasonable salt and pepper each
side<00:01:47.380> of<00:01:47.560> the<00:01:47.650> chicken
