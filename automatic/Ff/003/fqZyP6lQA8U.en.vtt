00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
hi welcome you show me the curry calm

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.010 
hi welcome you show me the curry calm
I'm<00:00:20.100> hit'll<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.580> beluga<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.449> today<00:00:21.900> we're

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
I'm hit'll a beluga and today we're

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.080 
I'm hit'll a beluga and today we're
talking<00:00:22.109> about<00:00:22.350> simple<00:00:22.890> syrups<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.490> their

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
talking about simple syrups and their

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.230 
talking about simple syrups and their
uses<00:00:24.390> now<00:00:25.380> we<00:00:26.010> hear<00:00:26.279> about<00:00:26.310> simple<00:00:26.730> syrups<00:00:27.060> all

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
uses now we hear about simple syrups all

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.570 
uses now we hear about simple syrups all
the<00:00:27.689> time<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.650> was<00:00:28.890> always<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.250> different

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
the time and it was always a different

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.519 
the time and it was always a different
ratio<00:00:29.760> of<00:00:30.210> water<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.570> sugar<00:00:30.960> for<00:00:31.140> all<00:00:31.230> of<00:00:31.380> these

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
ratio of water to sugar for all of these

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.350 
ratio of water to sugar for all of these
so<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.430> gets<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.640> little<00:00:32.730> confusing<00:00:32.910> at<00:00:33.300> times

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
so it gets a little confusing at times

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.600 
so it gets a little confusing at times
but<00:00:34.230> hopefully<00:00:34.680> we'll<00:00:34.829> clear<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.280> up<00:00:35.399> for

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
but hopefully we'll clear that up for

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.299 
but hopefully we'll clear that up for
you<00:00:35.670> today<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:37.050> first<00:00:37.200> kind<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.680> simple

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
you today so the first kind of simple

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.459 
you today so the first kind of simple
syrup<00:00:38.370> we're<00:00:38.820> going<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.030> do<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:39.930> basic

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
syrup we're going to do is a basic

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.790 
syrup we're going to do is a basic
simple<00:00:40.710> syrup<00:00:41.129> now<00:00:41.489> this<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:42.000> great<00:00:42.390> for

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
simple syrup now this is great for

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.040 
simple syrup now this is great for
drinks<00:00:43.800> cocktails<00:00:44.480> anything<00:00:45.480> that's<00:00:45.899> going

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
drinks cocktails anything that's going

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.020 
drinks cocktails anything that's going
to<00:00:46.110> be<00:00:46.200> sort<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.440> cold<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.489> know<00:00:47.610> has<00:00:47.820> ice

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
to be sort of cold that you know has ice

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.580 
to be sort of cold that you know has ice
in<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:49.020> don't<00:00:49.140> want<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.320> sit<00:00:49.410> there

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
in it and you don't want to sit there

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.650 
in it and you don't want to sit there
and<00:00:49.710> mix<00:00:49.950> sugar<00:00:50.070> inside<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:51.390> other<00:00:51.480> thing

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
and mix sugar inside and the other thing

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.029 
and mix sugar inside and the other thing
is<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.780> don't<00:00:51.899> want<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.170> water<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.530> down<00:00:52.649> too

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
is you don't want to water it down too

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.950 
is you don't want to water it down too
much<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.910> proportion<00:00:54.390> for<00:00:54.570> this<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.840> going

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
much so the proportion for this is going

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.799 
much so the proportion for this is going
to<00:00:55.050> be<00:00:55.140> one<00:00:55.320> part<00:00:55.590> sugar<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:56.160> one<00:00:56.340> part<00:00:56.610> water

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
to be one part sugar to one part water

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.319 
to be one part sugar to one part water
that's<00:00:57.809> pretty<00:00:57.989> simple<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.550> can<00:00:59.760> use<00:00:59.910> make

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
that's pretty simple so you can use make

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.260 
that's pretty simple so you can use make
any<00:01:00.600> amount<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.170> want<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:02.190> we're<00:01:02.609> just<00:01:02.640> making

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
any amount you want so we're just making

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.090 
any amount you want so we're just making
a<00:01:03.480> little<00:01:03.629> bit<00:01:03.840> so<00:01:04.080> equal<00:01:04.439> amounts<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:04.949> water

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
a little bit so equal amounts of water

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.390 
a little bit so equal amounts of water
and<00:01:05.489> sugar<00:01:06.200> mix<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.380> two<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:08.100> we're<00:01:08.220> going<00:01:08.310> to

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
and sugar mix the two so we're going to

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.950 
and sugar mix the two so we're going to
take<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.760> stove<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.180> cook<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:09.750> down<00:01:09.810> a

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
take it to the stove and cook it down a

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.410 
take it to the stove and cook it down a
little<00:01:10.229> bit<00:01:10.700> so<00:01:11.700> basically<00:01:11.970> we<00:01:12.150> have<00:01:12.270> our

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
little bit so basically we have our

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.240 
little bit so basically we have our
stove<00:01:12.630> on<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.840> medium<00:01:13.020> heat<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.710> what<00:01:14.130> we're

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
stove on a medium heat and what we're

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.560 
stove on a medium heat and what we're
going<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.430> do<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.640> let<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.880> water<00:01:15.090> come<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.540> a

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
going to do is let the water come to a

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.539 
going to do is let the water come to a
boil<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.049> once<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.680> comes<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.009> boil<00:01:17.220> we're

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
boil and once it comes to a boil we're

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.130 
boil and once it comes to a boil we're
going<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.759> make<00:01:17.880> sure<00:01:17.939> all<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.750> sugar<00:01:19.020> is

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
going to make sure all the sugar is

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.140 
going to make sure all the sugar is
completely<00:01:19.290> dissolved<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.490> as<00:01:20.610> soon<00:01:20.850> as<00:01:21.030> it

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
completely dissolved and as soon as it

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.760 
completely dissolved and as soon as it
gets<00:01:21.299> completely<00:01:21.450> dissolved<00:01:22.110> which<00:01:22.619> should

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
gets completely dissolved which should

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.160 
gets completely dissolved which should
only<00:01:22.830> take<00:01:23.100> about<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.729> minute<00:01:24.060> or<00:01:24.330> two<00:01:24.390> we're

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
only take about a minute or two we're

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.870 
only take about a minute or two we're
going<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.320> switch<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.680> off<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.159> take<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.790> off

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
going to switch it off and take it off

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.620 
going to switch it off and take it off
the<00:01:27.000> stove<00:01:27.500> actually<00:01:28.500> took<00:01:28.860> this<00:01:29.100> in<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.369> minute

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
the stove actually took this in a minute

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.960 
the stove actually took this in a minute
you<00:01:30.630> can<00:01:30.780> see<00:01:30.960> all<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.200> sugar<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.650> gone

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
you can see all the sugar is gone

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.200 
you can see all the sugar is gone
everything<00:01:32.970> is<00:01:33.060> mounted<00:01:33.979> perfect<00:01:35.030> then<00:01:36.030> turn

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
everything is mounted perfect then turn

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.710 
everything is mounted perfect then turn
off<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.450> stove<00:01:36.630> now<00:01:38.119> so<00:01:39.119> we<00:01:39.240> mentioned<00:01:39.600> there

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
off the stove now so we mentioned there

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.840 
off the stove now so we mentioned there
are<00:01:39.750> different<00:01:40.079> types<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.439> simple<00:01:41.400> syrup<00:01:41.430> and

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
are different types of simple syrup and

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.310 
are different types of simple syrup and
while<00:01:42.000> this<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.360> cooling<00:01:42.720> down<00:01:42.750> let's<00:01:43.170> talk

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
while this is cooling down let's talk

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.319 
while this is cooling down let's talk
about<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.680> others<00:01:43.950> because<00:01:44.579> one<00:01:44.939> is<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.180> one

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
about the others because one is the one

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.090 
about the others because one is the one
that<00:01:45.540> we<00:01:45.899> did<00:01:46.229> over<00:01:46.350> here

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
that we did over here

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.670 
that we did over here
what<00:01:47.610> what<00:01:48.000> it's<00:01:48.150> used<00:01:48.330> for<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:49.170> second<00:01:49.500> type

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
what what it's used for the second type

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.280 
what what it's used for the second type
is<00:01:49.830> that<00:01:50.100> we<00:01:50.820> use<00:01:51.000> two<00:01:51.360> parts<00:01:51.689> water<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.020> one

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
is that we use two parts water and one

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.370 
is that we use two parts water and one
part<00:01:52.530> sugar<00:01:52.590> now<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.670> is<00:01:53.850> used<00:01:54.210> for<00:01:54.930> things

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
part sugar now that is used for things
