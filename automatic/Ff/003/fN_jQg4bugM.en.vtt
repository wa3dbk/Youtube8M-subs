that's okay you can do it the more
complex<00:01:51.200> way<00:01:51.470> which<00:01:51.950> is<00:01:52.070> a<00:01:52.100> little<00:01:52.190> bit<00:01:52.430> more

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
complex way which is a little bit more

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.980 
complex way which is a little bit more
work<00:01:52.820> but<00:01:52.850> works<00:01:53.180> the<00:01:53.270> same<00:01:53.420> way<00:01:53.659> what<00:01:53.930> you

that lines already open but what you
essentially<00:02:21.320> what<00:02:21.440> you<00:02:21.500> want<00:02:21.650> to<00:02:21.740> do<00:02:21.890> it<00:02:22.880> might

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
essentially what you want to do it might

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.190 
essentially what you want to do it might
yours<00:02:23.240> might<00:02:23.450> look<00:02:23.570> a<00:02:23.660> little<00:02:23.690> different<00:02:24.140> from

yours might look a little different from

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.980 
yours might look a little different from
mine<00:02:24.440> but<00:02:24.770> it<00:02:25.040> will<00:02:25.190> ultimately<00:02:25.550> end<00:02:26.510> up

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
mine but it will ultimately end up

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.620 
mine but it will ultimately end up
looking<00:02:27.350> somewhat<00:02:27.800> like<00:02:27.980> this<00:02:28.450> and<00:02:29.450> what<00:02:29.600> you

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
looking somewhat like this and what you

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.060 
looking somewhat like this and what you
want<00:02:29.840> to<00:02:29.900> do<00:02:30.050> since<00:02:30.260> it's<00:02:30.440> open<00:02:30.770> you<00:02:30.860> want<00:02:30.950> to

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
want to do since it's open you want to

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.950 
want to do since it's open you want to
go<00:02:31.130> to<00:02:31.190> file<00:02:31.520> open<00:02:32.060> and<00:02:32.420> then<00:02:32.630> you<00:02:32.720> want<00:02:32.900> to

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.260 
go to file open and then you want to
figure<00:02:33.260> out<00:02:33.440> where<00:02:33.770> you<00:02:34.010> put<00:02:34.370> my<00:02:34.640> ass<00:02:34.850> gray

then patch it with pokémon ash gray same

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.090 
then patch it with pokémon ash gray same
thing<00:03:08.390> really<00:03:08.720> it's<00:03:08.960> exactly<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:09.590> same<00:03:09.770> way

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
thing really it's exactly the same way

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.220 
thing really it's exactly the same way
your<00:03:10.670> vba<00:03:11.060> might<00:03:11.420> look<00:03:11.570> different<00:03:11.780> from<00:03:12.020> mine

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
your vba might look different from mine

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.320 
your vba might look different from mine
but<00:03:12.260> that's<00:03:12.560> because<00:03:12.800> I'm<00:03:12.920> using<00:03:13.100> a<00:03:13.220> Mac<00:03:13.460> and
