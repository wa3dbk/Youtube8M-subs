check<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:45.899> chamber<00:00:46.260> because<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.500> need<00:00:46.739> to

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
check the chamber because you need to

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.650 
check the chamber because you need to
get<00:00:47.100> into<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.430> habit<00:00:47.640> if<00:00:48.300> you're<00:00:48.510> new<00:00:48.629> to

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660

guns<00:00:48.930> but<00:00:49.230> one<00:00:49.379> quick<00:00:49.590> way<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:50.579> trigger

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
guns but one quick way is that trigger

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.540 
guns but one quick way is that trigger
right<00:00:51.090> there<00:00:51.329> if<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.110> trigger<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.800> back<00:00:53.070> this

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
right there if that trigger is back this

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.630 
right there if that trigger is back this
gun<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:53.969> not<00:00:54.000> cocked<00:00:54.949> which<00:00:55.949> if<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.280> gun<00:00:56.430> isn't

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
gun is not cocked which if the gun isn't

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.160 
gun is not cocked which if the gun isn't
cocked<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.420> means<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.780> couldn't<00:00:58.079> have

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
cocked it means it couldn't have

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.869 
cocked it means it couldn't have
chambered<00:00:58.559> around<00:00:58.859> now<00:00:59.370> some<00:00:59.579> people<00:00:59.699> have

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
chambered around now some people have

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.220 
chambered around now some people have
argued<00:01:00.090> with<00:01:00.359> me<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.660> said<00:01:00.809> but<00:01:00.930> what<00:01:01.050> if<00:01:01.140> you

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
argued with me and said but what if you

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.810 
argued with me and said but what if you
put<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.530> gun<00:01:01.710> back<00:01:01.890> together<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.460> slid<00:01:02.789> a

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
put the gun back together and you slid a

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.350 
put the gun back together and you slid a
bullet<00:01:03.210> into<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.260> barrel<00:01:04.830> in<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.489> chamber

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
bullet into the barrel in the chamber

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.330 
bullet into the barrel in the chamber
and<00:01:06.479> slip<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.350> barrel<00:01:07.650> back<00:01:07.770> on<00:01:08.010> there<00:01:08.189> and

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
and slip the barrel back on there and

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.830 
and slip the barrel back on there and
slap<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.729> slide<00:01:08.939> back<00:01:09.150> on<00:01:09.360> here<00:01:09.540> now<00:01:09.689> there

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
slap the slide back on here now there

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.510 
slap the slide back on here now there
would<00:01:09.930> be<00:01:09.960> around<00:01:10.200> our<00:01:10.350> chamber<00:01:10.650> well<00:01:11.159> even<00:01:11.430> if

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
would be around our chamber well even if

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.640 
would be around our chamber well even if
there<00:01:11.700> was<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.540> gun<00:01:12.689> isn't<00:01:12.930> cocked<00:01:13.290> and

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
there was the gun isn't cocked and

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.170 
there was the gun isn't cocked and
couldn't<00:01:13.920> fire<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.549> when<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.760> pulled<00:01:15.030> the

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
couldn't fire it and when you pulled the

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.820 
couldn't fire it and when you pulled the
slide<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.659> fire<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.170> gun<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.500> would<00:01:16.560> eject

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
slide to fire the gun it would eject

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.679 
slide to fire the gun it would eject
around<00:01:17.220> now<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:17.729> haven't<00:01:18.090> tried<00:01:18.330> putting

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
around now I haven't tried putting

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:19.969 
around now I haven't tried putting
around<00:01:19.049> in<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.380> seeing<00:01:19.590> if<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.770> could

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
around in and seeing if you could

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.590 
around in and seeing if you could
actually<00:01:20.189> put<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.640> back<00:01:20.850> together<00:01:21.030> in<00:01:21.450> that

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
actually put it back together in that

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.109 
actually put it back together in that
way<00:01:21.659> but<00:01:22.439> either<00:01:22.560> way<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:23.490> wouldn't<00:01:23.909> work

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
way but either way it wouldn't work

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.190 
way but either way it wouldn't work
because<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.570> would<00:01:24.689> eject<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.170> round

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
because you would eject the round

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.039 
because you would eject the round
putting<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.979> slide<00:01:26.189> back<00:01:26.490> onto<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.210> gun<00:01:27.390> so

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
putting the slide back onto the gun so

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.100 
putting the slide back onto the gun so
there<00:01:28.470> would<00:01:28.650> not<00:01:28.890> be<00:01:29.310> around<00:01:29.640> in<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.659> chamber

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
there would not be around in the chamber

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.090 
there would not be around in the chamber
but<00:01:31.590> anyway<00:01:31.979> just<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:33.119> quick<00:01:33.299> tip<00:01:33.860> like<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:34.950> said

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
but anyway just a quick tip like I said

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.740 
but anyway just a quick tip like I said

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
all swapped out now like I said it being

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:04.880 
all swapped out now like I said it being
the<00:03:03.090> years<00:03:03.360> it<00:03:03.510> had<00:03:03.690> on<00:03:03.870> it<00:03:04.019> and<00:03:04.230> being

the years it had on it and being

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.180 
the years it had on it and being
original<00:03:05.430> parts<00:03:05.760> I<00:03:05.970> had<00:03:06.900> no<00:03:07.260> issue<00:03:07.530> with<00:03:07.709> it<00:03:08.010> I

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
original parts I had no issue with it I

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.610 
original parts I had no issue with it I
just<00:03:08.579> did<00:03:08.760> it<00:03:08.879> myself<00:03:09.060> so<00:03:09.599> I<00:03:09.629> can<00:03:09.900> get<00:03:10.079> plenty

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
just did it myself so I can get plenty

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.650 
just did it myself so I can get plenty
in<00:03:10.739> more<00:03:10.890> years<00:03:11.220> without<00:03:11.430> worrying<00:03:11.790> it<00:03:12.030> really

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
in more years without worrying it really

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.330 
in more years without worrying it really
and<00:03:12.810> truthfully<00:03:12.989> it<00:03:13.410> was<00:03:13.560> probably<00:03:14.010> a<00:03:14.099> waste

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
and truthfully it was probably a waste

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.759 
and truthfully it was probably a waste
of<00:03:14.549> money<00:03:14.640> because<00:03:14.910> these<00:03:15.239> Glocks<00:03:15.599> they<00:03:16.440> just

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
of money because these Glocks they just

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.860 
of money because these Glocks they just
seem<00:03:16.980> to<00:03:17.010> go<00:03:17.310> and<00:03:17.609> go<00:03:17.730> and<00:03:17.760> go<00:03:18.120> and<00:03:18.150> go<00:03:18.510> and<00:03:18.540> not

seem to go and go and go and go and not

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.660 
seem to go and go and go and go and not

I<00:03:22.859> didn't<00:03:23.100> swap<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.430> barrel<00:03:23.700> out<00:03:23.790> or<00:03:24.000> anything

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
I didn't swap the barrel out or anything

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.150 
I didn't swap the barrel out or anything
and<00:03:24.450> I<00:03:24.540> could<00:03:24.690> sit<00:03:24.870> there<00:03:24.900> and<00:03:25.170> run<00:03:25.769> groups

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160

like crazy with this thing a lot of

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:29.780 
like crazy with this thing a lot of
people<00:03:28.319> say<00:03:28.500> all<00:03:28.650> ten<00:03:28.859> millimeters<00:03:29.340> too<00:03:29.579> much

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
be surprised at how well this gun can

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.680 
be surprised at how well this gun can
handle<00:03:34.889> that<00:03:35.069> recoil<00:03:35.519> even<00:03:36.209> being<00:03:36.359> an<00:03:36.540> old

gen 4 style recoil spring which
everybody<00:03:40.950> says<00:03:41.160> though<00:03:41.310> that's<00:03:41.579> how<00:03:41.730> their

taming the recoil I'm telling you right

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.220 
taming the recoil I'm telling you right
now<00:03:44.220> it<00:03:44.639> is<00:03:44.790> not<00:03:45.180> what<00:03:45.359> you<00:03:45.480> think<00:03:45.660> it<00:03:45.810> is<00:03:45.989> and

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
now it is not what you think it is and

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.050 
now it is not what you think it is and
this<00:03:46.739> gun<00:03:46.980> is<00:03:47.220> a<00:03:47.459> great<00:03:48.030> shooting<00:03:48.389> gun<00:03:50.060> but

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
this gun is a great shooting gun but

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.580 
this gun is a great shooting gun but
this<00:03:51.389> is<00:03:51.510> my<00:03:51.660> one<00:03:51.810> of<00:03:51.870> my<00:03:51.930> failings<00:03:52.139> hit<00:03:52.470> my

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
this is my one of my failings hit my

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.140 
this is my one of my failings hit my
favorite<00:03:53.010> home<00:03:53.310> defense<00:03:53.730> weapon

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
favorite home defense weapon

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:00.400 
favorite home defense weapon
as<00:03:54.900> you<00:03:55.019> can<00:03:55.139> see<00:03:56.269> Glock<00:03:57.269> 20<00:03:57.720> 10<00:03:58.470> millimeter

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
as you can see Glock 20 10 millimeter

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.199 
as you can see Glock 20 10 millimeter
just<00:04:01.410> because<00:04:01.769> it's<00:04:01.980> a<00:04:02.040> nice<00:04:02.220> big<00:04:02.609> full-sized

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
just because it's a nice big full-sized

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.030 
just because it's a nice big full-sized
gun<00:04:03.510> the<00:04:04.019> only<00:04:04.230> thing<00:04:04.380> I<00:04:04.440> probably<00:04:04.590> don't<00:04:04.829> like

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
gun the only thing I probably don't like

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.400 
gun the only thing I probably don't like
is<00:04:05.280> it<00:04:05.400> being<00:04:05.579> an<00:04:05.669> early<00:04:05.790> model<00:04:06.150> I<00:04:06.389> can't<00:04:07.169> put

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
is it being an early model I can't put

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.900 
is it being an early model I can't put
the<00:04:07.530> white<00:04:07.799> or<00:04:07.950> anything<00:04:08.099> like<00:04:08.430> that

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
the white or anything like that

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.780 
the white or anything like that
so<00:04:09.650> now<00:04:10.650> I<00:04:10.680> have<00:04:10.859> some<00:04:11.040> other<00:04:11.190> models<00:04:11.579> that<00:04:11.639> I

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
so now I have some other models that I

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.370 
so now I have some other models that I
could<00:04:12.030> and<00:04:12.299> I<00:04:12.329> haven't<00:04:12.630> done<00:04:12.780> yet<00:04:13.049> so<00:04:13.260> I'm

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
could and I haven't done yet so I'm

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.020 
could and I haven't done yet so I'm
probably<00:04:13.680> need<00:04:13.769> to<00:04:13.859> do<00:04:14.010> that<00:04:14.220> they're<00:04:14.430> not<00:04:14.549> 20s

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
probably need to do that they're not 20s

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.300 
probably need to do that they're not 20s
but<00:04:15.829> other<00:04:16.829> Glocks<00:04:17.190> so<00:04:18.289> but<00:04:19.289> like<00:04:19.470> I<00:04:19.500> said<00:04:19.769> this
