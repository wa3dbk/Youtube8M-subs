00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.610
 maintaining today is of course about you 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.800

 it looks very good so I go there 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.349

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:24.949
 we do offer ma well who do you see 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.050
 quite a few novus and 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.699
 different type of stickers 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.739
 first of all you want to know of course 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:31.939
 which types almost live grandma 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:33.590
 Well first of all we have the 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:34.970
 for coal stabbing that they sticker that 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.610
 is printed on their thin white 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.860
 foil and that done it just how it did 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.590
 good to show this stick is real 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.600
 made of very thin material and he can do so 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.610
 this can be pasted over a globe of a monkey 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.510
 be because it actually forms all 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.430
 on lace 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.570
 for that you see one meant you have one 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.120
 convex to 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.040
 then order the full color sticker and 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.900
 you can shape that around yourself completely 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.329
 very nice nice effect 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.070
 very easy to apply 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.470
 you to a flat harbor view for yes me 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.449
 actually want to have an analogue on it or 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.040
 the old ones are logical they take nicely then 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.050
 we have the chrome stickers for that 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.420
 a big stitches where i meet this one 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.790
 side that are a bit thicker 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.840
 they are also printed on a chrome 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.880
 foil 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.170
 well we also see the green foil that 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.659
 completely reflects 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.310
 the logo is printed on it afterwards 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.729
 we provide the sticker on the bottom 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.440
 of the strong adhesive film and because the 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.880
 sticker then extra good he can prepare you 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.530
 often hard or find something nicer 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.299
 market area then this is i 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.240
 very good for because they really go 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.650
 do not finish after this foil there is real this 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.049
 pack very well when moving there 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.150
 maybe longer than 5 minutes here 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.070
 on'd like you would the appearance of 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.619
 this really makes me go very well 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.890
 strong straight in the foil that goes own 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.780
 at the bottom of the large foil and 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.600
 then you see the gramophone provided 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.100
 u more of a transparent laminate and 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.290
 we do that because of course you like 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.670
 wants to drive through the car wash and 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.030
 that the sticker doesn't just finish 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.310
 falls 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.010
 well that is of course very nice because then 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.230
 You can also see for yourself that is thicker 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.470
 stays put and is good 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:09.550
 it's well here we actually in the 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.330
 transparent laminate that goes there 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.770
 across 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.990
 nation goes over it becomes it 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.120
 most beautiful crystal clear you can get the logo whatever 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:19.840
 you ordered has definitely seen well 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.010
 do this one 4 here we see big afterwards 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.690
 examples of 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.880
 you order in your own size we have 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.650
 already from 3 centimeters to one hundred 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.090
 twenty five centimeters 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.250
 order your own size 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.420
 actually delivered in the middle 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.730
 we always do a nice one 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.770
 square the we with your own 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.470
 mate so that you know exactly it 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.330
 also true but you say i refuse one 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.850
 have a sticker that is actually the cell 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.550
 if the logo is nice and thick, you can 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.400
 nowadays also deliver the 3d Sneek 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.440
 of course extra luxury for us too 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.750
 some more work because these stickers 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.020
 we then provide an epoxy resin layer 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.690
 we actually do that on the going 24 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.500
 hour to dry and then they can go to you 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.570
 be sent 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.030
 they don't have an example of that 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.130
 you can actually see how thick it is 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.920
 is being he is about two and half 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.470
 hour mm thick but can only be stuck 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.660
 are on a plane after 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.150
 because the sticker is not flexible it 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.950
 will be something flexible but not flexible 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.320
 enough for a bulb 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.220
 so very important you have just after 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.260
 no problem 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.280
 but do not put this on a sphere and 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.680
 taping off 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.510
 because they are not meant for that 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.250
 if you go to your own logo we have that 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.310
 He tells me that seems to me absolutely going 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.910
 to put their own logo on my wheel hub 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.550
 to stick 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.080
 then it is also possible you can send an email 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.660
 send to questions the choke but if 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.530
 punt nl and you want more of our will to
