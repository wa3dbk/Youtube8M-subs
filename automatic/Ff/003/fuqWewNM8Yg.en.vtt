playing<00:00:41.339> at<00:00:41.430> 1080p<00:00:41.670> my<00:00:42.510> monitor<00:00:42.960> is

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
playing at 1080p my monitor is

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.590 
playing at 1080p my monitor is
overclocked<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.920> complete<00:00:44.550> 1440p<00:00:45.180> able<00:00:45.449> to

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
overclocked I complete 1440p able to

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.299 
overclocked I complete 1440p able to
keep<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.780> at<00:00:45.899> 1080p<00:00:46.140> because<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.040> lot<00:00:47.220> of<00:00:47.250> people

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
keep it at 1080p because a lot of people

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.639 
keep it at 1080p because a lot of people
have<00:00:47.610> 1080p<00:00:48.059> monitors<00:00:48.479> so<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.199> was<00:00:49.409> like<00:00:49.500> okay

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
have 1080p monitors so I was like okay

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.770 
have 1080p monitors so I was like okay
and<00:00:50.190> it's<00:00:50.699> going<00:00:50.790> to<00:00:50.879> look<00:00:50.969> flickr<00:00:51.359> a<00:00:51.539> little

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.680 
and it's going to look flickr a little
bit<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.620> know<00:00:53.179> get<00:00:54.179> a<00:00:54.210> set<00:00:54.480> accept

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
bit and you know get a set accept

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.520 
bit and you know get a set accept
changes<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:56.000> right<00:00:57.000> there<00:00:57.300> on<00:00:57.510> your<00:00:57.539> top<00:00:57.960> left

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
changes and right there on your top left

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.099 
changes and right there on your top left
hand<00:00:58.800> corner<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.879> can<00:01:00.030> see<00:01:00.089> that<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.660> bunch<00:01:00.989> of

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
hand corner you can see that a bunch of

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.979 
hand corner you can see that a bunch of
stuff<00:01:01.320> in<00:01:01.469> green<00:01:01.769> test<00:01:02.670> information

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
stuff in green test information

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.800 
stuff in green test information
currently<00:01:03.989> i'm<00:01:04.110> getting<00:01:04.379> 94<00:01:04.739> first<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:05.070> second

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810

10<00:01:06.810> millisecond<00:01:07.380> response<00:01:07.440> time<00:01:07.979> i<00:01:08.399> believe

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
10 millisecond response time i believe

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.560 
10 millisecond response time i believe
that<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:10.130> keep<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.310> temperature<00:01:11.759> 60<00:01:12.090> celsius

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
that is keep the temperature 60 celsius

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.790 
that is keep the temperature 60 celsius
a<00:01:12.750> seventy<00:01:13.470> percent<00:01:13.590> usage<00:01:13.920> at<00:01:14.789> 1.2<00:01:15.330> volts

that I found out lately you know people

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.319 
that I found out lately you know people
only<00:01:43.619> being<00:01:43.799> able<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:44.040> use<00:01:44.100> 3.5<00:01:44.790> gigs<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.210> the

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
only being able to use 3.5 gigs of the

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.840 
only being able to use 3.5 gigs of the
memory<00:01:45.630> which<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:46.619> really<00:01:46.979> fast<00:01:47.280> memory<00:01:47.520> and

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
memory which is really fast memory and

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.300 
memory which is really fast memory and
then<00:01:48.000> like<00:01:48.180> there's<00:01:48.390> another<00:01:48.630> partition<00:01:49.310> 500

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
then like there's another partition 500

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.270 
then like there's another partition 500

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.770 
cause issues and games job performance
and<00:01:56.159> like<00:01:56.729> stuttering<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.360> stuff<00:01:57.600> like<00:01:57.719> that

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
and I notice my car does not want to go

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.279 
and I notice my car does not want to go
over<00:02:00.780> 3.5<00:02:01.500> gigs<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.070> I'm<00:02:02.130> pissed<00:02:02.600> but<00:02:03.600> I'm

over 3.5 gigs and I'm pissed but I'm
gonna<00:02:04.439> save<00:02:04.619> that<00:02:04.649> for<00:02:04.890> another<00:02:04.920> video<00:02:06.649> so<00:02:07.649> now

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
gonna save that for another video so now

gonna save that for another video so now
let's<00:02:07.920> go<00:02:08.009> ahead<00:02:08.130> load<00:02:08.280> up<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.459> game<00:02:08.700> and

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
let's go ahead load up the game and

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.520 
let's go ahead load up the game and
check<00:02:09.149> out<00:02:09.269> the<00:02:09.390> performers<00:02:09.959> that<00:02:09.989> we<00:02:10.170> get<00:02:10.380> it

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
check out the performers that we get it

say fluctuates all over the place 42

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.140 
say fluctuates all over the place 42
first<00:04:41.069> a<00:04:41.159> second<00:04:41.430> right<00:04:41.490> now<00:04:41.639> you<00:04:41.699> can<00:04:41.879> see<00:04:42.000> the

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
first a second right now you can see the

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.839 
first a second right now you can see the
top<00:04:42.360> corner<00:04:42.690> also<00:04:43.229> it<00:04:43.409> is<00:04:43.620> yellow<00:04:43.830> that's<00:04:44.729> the

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:44.849 
top corner also it is yellow that's the

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:49.219 
top corner also it is yellow that's the
frame<00:04:45.060> rate<00:04:45.270> also<00:04:46.819> everything<00:04:47.819> is<00:04:47.940> equal<00:04:48.300> so

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:49.229 
frame rate also everything is equal so

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:51.200 
frame rate also everything is equal so
that<00:04:49.349> that's<00:04:49.440> basically<00:04:49.800> the<00:04:49.889> strap<00:04:50.280> 4150<00:04:51.150> a

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
that that's basically the strap 4150 a

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:56.059 
that that's basically the strap 4150 a
second<00:04:51.539> I<00:04:51.599> was<00:04:51.720> expecting<00:04:52.139> a<00:04:52.500> fluid<00:04:53.340> 60fps<00:04:55.069> GPU

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:56.069 
second I was expecting a fluid 60fps GPU

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:57.980 
second I was expecting a fluid 60fps GPU
is<00:04:56.099> a<00:04:56.220> thirty-six<00:04:56.909> percent<00:04:57.060> utilization

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
is a thirty-six percent utilization

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.140 
is a thirty-six percent utilization
that's<00:04:58.560> kind<00:04:59.159> of<00:04:59.220> bad<00:04:59.490> I<00:04:59.699> don't<00:04:59.849> know<00:04:59.940> what's

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
that's kind of bad I don't know what's

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.809 
that's kind of bad I don't know what's
bald<00:05:00.419> like<00:05:00.539> in<00:05:00.690> the<00:05:00.750> game<00:05:00.979> however<00:05:01.979> I<00:05:02.370> did<00:05:02.789> find

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:02.819 
bald like in the game however I did find

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:05.420 
bald like in the game however I did find
something<00:05:03.300> I<00:05:03.750> used<00:05:04.380> my<00:05:04.530> phone<00:05:04.800> to<00:05:04.830> monitor<00:05:05.280> the

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
something I used my phone to monitor the

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.210 
something I used my phone to monitor the
cpu<00:05:06.060> utilization<00:05:06.300> and<00:05:07.020> I<00:05:07.440> found<00:05:07.650> that<00:05:07.830> one

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
cpu utilization and I found that one

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.980 
cpu utilization and I found that one
core<00:05:08.639> is<00:05:08.909> at<00:05:09.060> a<00:05:09.090> hundred<00:05:09.330> percent<00:05:09.509> and<00:05:09.930> the

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
core is at a hundred percent and the

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.999 
core is at a hundred percent and the
rest<00:05:10.169> of<00:05:10.259> the<00:05:10.349> cars<00:05:10.590> are<00:05:11.219> actually<00:05:11.550> between<00:05:11.759> a

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:13.009 
rest of the cars are actually between a

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:16.430 
rest of the cars are actually between a
40<00:05:14.009> in<00:05:14.310> like<00:05:14.520> seventy<00:05:15.000> percent<00:05:15.379> fluctuating<00:05:16.379> I

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
40 in like seventy percent fluctuating I

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.920 
40 in like seventy percent fluctuating I
took<00:05:16.500> a<00:05:16.620> snapshot<00:05:16.949> you<00:05:17.340> guys<00:05:17.490> to<00:05:17.639> see<00:05:17.879> it<00:05:18.000> or<00:05:18.870> I

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
guys how it actually operates but this

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.950 
guys how it actually operates but this
is<00:05:28.979> basically<00:05:29.130> is<00:05:29.460> going<00:05:29.699> on<00:05:29.759> so<00:05:30.449> I<00:05:30.659> don't<00:05:30.870> know

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
is basically is going on so I don't know

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.850 
is basically is going on so I don't know
what<00:05:31.319> it's<00:05:31.440> like<00:05:31.469> on<00:05:31.590> the<00:05:31.710> ps4<00:05:31.979> I'm<00:05:33.800> going<00:05:34.800> to

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
what it's like on the ps4 I'm going to

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.589 
what it's like on the ps4 I'm going to
look<00:05:34.949> at<00:05:35.039> a<00:05:35.069> video<00:05:35.219> if<00:05:35.580> I<00:05:35.669> would<00:05:35.789> guess<00:05:35.909> 60<00:05:36.150> FPS

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:36.599 
look at a video if I would guess 60 FPS

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:39.499 
look at a video if I would guess 60 FPS
no<00:05:36.810> issues<00:05:37.639> unfortunately<00:05:38.639> pc<00:05:39.029> has<00:05:39.180> a<00:05:39.210> bunch

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:39.509 
no issues unfortunately pc has a bunch

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:43.339 
no issues unfortunately pc has a bunch
of<00:05:39.690> considerations<00:05:40.560> and<00:05:40.860> stuff<00:05:41.099> so<00:05:42.029> i<00:05:42.630> guess

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:43.349 
of considerations and stuff so i guess

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:45.800 
of considerations and stuff so i guess
maybe<00:05:43.710> that<00:05:44.039> shouldn't<00:05:44.669> be<00:05:44.729> an<00:05:44.819> issue<00:05:44.940> but<00:05:45.449> it

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
maybe that shouldn't be an issue but it

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.200 
maybe that shouldn't be an issue but it
currently<00:05:46.710> is<00:05:46.770> because<00:05:47.190> i'm<00:05:47.310> getting<00:05:47.430> 37

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:48.210
