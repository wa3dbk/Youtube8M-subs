00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:06.859
 hello I'm mini cork 210's it's a new 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:09.380
 video video in this case we are going to 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:12.860
 present a game available for 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.390
 cell phones with touch screen and also 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.160
 that have buttons but more recommendable 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:18.769
 for mate tactics because if you have 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.849
 a better experience there are many things 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:24.390
 to highlight the game that I love 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:27.300
 so 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.279
 let's go see a mini gameplay 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.930
 while we talk about details and the 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:36.079
 rating that I give to the game ok 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.070
 so 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:43.730
 the sun immediately shows 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:46.579
 about the sun on the screen and we're going 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:51.610
 the screens that has type of matter 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:59.030
 of 240 x 400 pesos mb 166% 88 a 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:01:03.580
 176 x 220 921 droits 240 x 320 to 1020 and 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.580
 of 35 of 2 x 4 and 6 2 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.530
 that's very good final 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.630
 variety in the graphics we are going to give 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.570
 two of three the graphics because I think 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.700
 that could have been better but it happens 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.960
 unnoticed what is best designed 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.870
 you immediately notice that it is the 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.000
 vehicle 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.550
 that there is not a great variety of 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.010
 vehicles but it's fine 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:33.210
 the jewel where seven we see that it is for him 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:37.830
 here raising and like when you put it together 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.500
 it's fine but ahead of 2.43 and 2.43 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.200
 skeletal 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.600
 being from a single town that went with 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.410
 the world for the state sorry and a 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.060
 once liquidated turn 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.399
 quite 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.390
 financial as boring because I 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:57.770
 gave back 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.479
 and in originality 0.5 at a time 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.439
 it's a racing game but the original 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:05.539
 with all this is that it has the seriousness 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.549
 we talk about the vehicle not traveling 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:11.420
 in a flat territory as it happens to me 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:15.160
 even games of ea in music you want 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:19.350
 something extra we will give you 0 points 71 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.350
 music is one for the menu and one for 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:27.370
 for what the gay game then the 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:30.939
 Total note that we give is 8.3 out of 10 of 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:34.560
 well of total score and it's not bad and 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:37.220
 it's very good the game is amazing 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.220
 once 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.000
 as we see the classification in the 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:50.350
 liquidated our game in this case 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:56.970
 rating drive see this game 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:56.970
 was done by 7 have expired and 13 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.540
 classifications that is good is not what 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.040
 optimal but it is very well designed in 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.460
 comparison to many other games and 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.720
 also the versions of 36 and 55 and 3 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.840
 hours 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.480
 he has a great variety of 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:19.660
 screens or scenarios and three 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.730
 vehicles that could have been more and 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.040
 also include a way in which 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.290
 is traveling alone by pressing me 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.040
 although for that to be in the mode 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.730
 multiplayer 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.760
 it's very good 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:36.710
 and as I want to emphasize that this game 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.350
 you do not go through a flat stage 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.650
 Y 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.540
 I simply loved it because there 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.640
 comes the movement of vehicle is very 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.940
 they have well recreated what gives something 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.370
 Realistic thing that is not seen in the air 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.909
 of the racing game 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.909
 13 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:03.410
 very good the game 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.840
 and also for example in games like 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.250
 then as the need for speed the run no 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.290
 has action but well this is what 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.610
 we give today and I hope you like the 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.049
 link is under the description and we 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.049
 we see goodbye
