00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
then this is your the local side

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.920 
then this is your the local side
so<00:02:14.070> this<00:02:14.220> is<00:02:14.400> your<00:02:14.700> computer<00:02:14.970> this<00:02:15.540> is<00:02:15.780> your

so this is your computer this is your

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.960 
so this is your computer this is your
server<00:02:16.170> so<00:02:17.160> now<00:02:17.540> for<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.630> sake<00:02:18.840> of<00:02:18.870> this<00:02:19.110> video

you want to go download something and

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.810 
you want to go download something and
mine<00:02:24.060> I<00:02:24.510> have<00:02:24.960> I<00:02:25.290> have<00:02:25.950> I<00:02:26.160> make<00:02:26.460> a<00:02:26.490> little

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
mine I have I have I make a little

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.940 
mine I have I have I make a little
folder<00:02:27.150> right<00:02:27.330> here<00:02:27.680> simulating<00:02:28.680> an<00:02:28.770> add-on

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
folder right here simulating an add-on

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.680 
folder right here simulating an add-on
so<00:02:29.430> once<00:02:29.610> you<00:02:29.700> download<00:02:29.820> an<00:02:30.210> add-on<00:02:32.690> who's

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
so once you download an add-on who's

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.230 
so once you download an add-on who's
gonna<00:02:33.840> make<00:02:34.260> this<00:02:34.410> little<00:02:34.680> folder<00:02:34.860> new<00:02:35.670> text

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
gonna make this little folder new text

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.720 
gonna make this little folder new text
documents<00:02:36.870> just<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:38.100> don't<00:02:38.190> have<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.460> do<00:02:38.580> this

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
documents just you don't have to do this

your add-on into server add-ons see
right<00:03:11.489> here<00:03:11.610> you<00:03:11.730> see<00:03:11.940> add-on<00:03:12.300> simulation

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
right here you see add-on simulation

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.810 
right here you see add-on simulation
that's<00:03:13.110> what<00:03:13.230> I<00:03:13.290> named<00:03:13.500> it<00:03:13.650> now<00:03:14.310> close<00:03:14.550> out<00:03:14.730> of

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
that's what I named it now close out of

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.960 
that's what I named it now close out of
that<00:03:14.970> you<00:03:15.900> want<00:03:16.110> FileZilla<00:03:16.800> open<00:03:17.310> again<00:03:17.610> open

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
that you want FileZilla open again open

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.650 
that you want FileZilla open again open
again<00:03:18.209> then<00:03:19.140> you<00:03:19.290> want<00:03:19.440> to<00:03:19.940> find<00:03:20.940> wherever<00:03:21.450> you

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
again then you want to find wherever you

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.840 
again then you want to find wherever you
put<00:03:22.170> that<00:03:22.350> your<00:03:23.090> should<00:03:24.090> be<00:03:24.269> in<00:03:24.480> C<00:03:24.930> Drive<00:03:25.850> where

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
put that your should be in C Drive where

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.820 
put that your should be in C Drive where
C<00:03:27.209> drive<00:03:27.510> up<00:03:27.750> here<00:03:27.780> C<00:03:28.590> Drive<00:03:30.019> server<00:03:31.019> add-ons

C drive up here C Drive server add-ons

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.210 
C drive up here C Drive server add-ons
right<00:03:32.250> here<00:03:32.489> and<00:03:32.760> then<00:03:33.720> you'd<00:03:34.500> see<00:03:34.799> add-on

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
right here and then you'd see add-on

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.860 
right here and then you'd see add-on
simulation<00:03:35.880> well<00:03:36.120> this<00:03:36.239> is<00:03:36.390> where<00:03:36.540> I<00:03:36.570> have

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
simulation well this is where I have

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.949 
simulation well this is where I have
here<00:03:37.140> you<00:03:37.620> should<00:03:37.799> see<00:03:37.980> your<00:03:38.160> ad<00:03:38.400> on<00:03:38.580> and<00:03:38.959> now

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
here you should see your ad on and now

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.130 
here you should see your ad on and now
you<00:03:40.019> want<00:03:40.350> to<00:03:41.150> press<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.269> little<00:03:42.480> plus<00:03:42.690> on

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
you want to press the little plus on

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.840 
you want to press the little plus on
that<00:03:43.500> box<00:03:44.150> Garry's<00:03:45.150> Mod<00:03:45.180> o<00:03:46.519> open<00:03:47.519> that<00:03:47.670> up

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
that box Garry's Mod o open that up

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.180 
that box Garry's Mod o open that up
there<00:03:48.450> you<00:03:48.510> go<00:03:48.660> and<00:03:48.900> then<00:03:49.049> add-ons<00:03:49.500> just<00:03:49.830> left

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
there you go and then add-ons just left

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.370 
there you go and then add-ons just left
click<00:03:50.459> that<00:03:50.640> once<00:03:50.940> and<00:03:51.239> now<00:03:51.780> you<00:03:51.840> should<00:03:52.200> see

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
click that once and now you should see

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.280 
click that once and now you should see
your<00:03:52.560> servers<00:03:53.010> add-ons<00:03:53.519> and<00:03:53.959> then<00:03:54.959> you<00:03:55.080> just

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
your servers add-ons and then you just

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.060 
your servers add-ons and then you just
move<00:03:55.500> your<00:03:55.799> add-on<00:03:56.459> from<00:03:57.120> here<00:03:57.680> over<00:03:58.680> to<00:03:58.860> there

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
move your add-on from here over to there

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.420 
move your add-on from here over to there
so<00:03:59.330> now<00:04:00.440> once<00:04:01.440> that<00:04:01.530> gets<00:04:01.830> done<00:04:02.040> it<00:04:02.220> is<00:04:02.400> done

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
so now once that gets done it is done

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.780 
so now once that gets done it is done
now<00:04:03.260> that<00:04:04.260> just<00:04:04.470> uploaded<00:04:05.070> and<00:04:05.250> you<00:04:05.459> can<00:04:05.610> see

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
now that just uploaded and you can see

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.449 
now that just uploaded and you can see
add-on<00:04:06.299> simulation<00:04:06.989> right<00:04:07.140> there<00:04:07.410> so<00:04:07.890> then

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
add-on simulation right there so then

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.340 
add-on simulation right there so then
that's<00:04:08.670> that's<00:04:09.299> the<00:04:09.510> add-on<00:04:09.810> for<00:04:09.989> your<00:04:10.140> server

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
that's that's the add-on for your server

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.880 
that's that's the add-on for your server
and<00:04:10.620> now<00:04:11.489> what<00:04:11.820> you<00:04:11.940> want<00:04:12.120> to<00:04:12.150> do<00:04:12.329> is<00:04:12.540> just<00:04:13.350> go

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
and now what you want to do is just go

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.550 
and now what you want to do is just go
restart<00:04:14.880> your<00:04:15.000> server<00:04:15.180> and<00:04:15.570> then<00:04:16.169> it<00:04:16.200> should

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
restart your server and then it should

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.920 
restart your server and then it should
be<00:04:16.680> on<00:04:16.799> there<00:04:17.060> thank<00:04:18.060> you<00:04:18.180> for<00:04:18.329> watching<00:04:18.660> and
