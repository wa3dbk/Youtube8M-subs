00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:13.280
 well then we are talking about the 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:17.330
 rosaries or take note something important in 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:20.539
 medicine is when we call cranial 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:23.630
 it means that it's going to the big one and 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:27.410
 when it is caudal because they are part 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:31.760
 farther if you dig a flow for example 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:36.050
 common in dogs its tail 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.850
 are the caudal vertebrae then yes 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.210
 come cranial 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:44.179
 roll down 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.800
 and then the wings have come 

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:52.750
 all 46 by 8 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:56.070
 99 domestic birds 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:01:04.550
 we have 2 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:04.550
 2 thoracic air and cervical sacs 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:15.790
 2 all and all mothers 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:17.110
 two abdominal and inter clavicular of 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.490
 same 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:25.150
 2 refills two basic cranial two 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:28.300
 tails and the two abdominals and caudal 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:31.570
 one inter movie depending on the 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:36.640
 kind of the b depending on the equipment and 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:40.060
 because it is not the same as I have 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.610
 Well, I 'm not a canary to have a 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.330
 ostrich once they have less harassment to 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:49.250
 them that has lost the ability to 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:53.210
 fly alone 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.330
 and then let's review we had 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.620
 remember marinas 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:01.090
 were nostrils would be drivers to the 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.240
 that have been of all tubes 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.490
 simple to heat the exhaled air 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.240
 later we would have in the part 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.230
 higher 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:13.780
 that palate the palatal cleft now 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.570
 we understand that this sense will 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.210
 allows to pass with higher speed of 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.250
 exhaled air 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:27.160
 we had a trachea so it's the 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:30.210
 duct that goes from the larynx to 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.740
 the lungs is made of rings 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:36.490
 cartilaginous coated by small 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:41.140
 muscle fibers other things 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:43.870
 they allowed them to stop producing mucus and 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:47.470
 they served us so that the foot if it had 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:50.140
 that rigidity allows you to keep your eyesight 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:56.650
 maintain the airway 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:03:00.100
 and he also part of some body 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.770
 strange in that dust stones and as a 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:06.510
 times children the case of humans 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:09.700
 sedesa millions of screws and this 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.780
 feature has reached them here 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.780
 but how 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:21.470
 we are not going to delve so much into this 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:24.390
 lung anatomy start it but 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.480
 we have bronchi later if 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:30.810
 let's say inside turn it goes 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:33.870
 digesting is the primary ones themselves 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:39.120
 own the secondary ones here comes the 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:41.930
 most interesting part of the lung 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.810
 in the case of the other mammals 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:48.260
 surely they have seen it in primary 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:52.769
 with a mammogram we can read it 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:55.810
 in us together humans and there 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.460
 an exchange not 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:01.400
 say 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:05.110
 a lung we have oxygen 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.110
 when we breathe that oxygen 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.500
 it would 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:16.930
 carbon dioxide forests that or 

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:19.509
 any of the then it is said that 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:23.729
 in us the exchange that is point 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:29.580
 one comes out carbon dioxide and enter 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:31.889
 oxygen this by pressures in the 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.439
 inspiron 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:38.360
 I have to proceed in the lung , the 

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:41.330
 carbon dioxide and enters the 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:44.479
 also in mammals if not all 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:47.110
 they saw from all this bronchi the 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:47.110
 primary 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:53.710
 after we'd give the world where 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:57.270
 we would have the pulmonary employer 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:05:00.169
 in lung dueling would become 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:06.469
 arterial vessels 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:09.529
 and glasses of us without that structure 

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:11.220
 minimum of the lung because I explain them 

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:15.430
 this 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:18.260
 during this visit to this little one like 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.360
 it's something called 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:23.350
 then we said that the exchange 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.350
 Thank you 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:30.569
 in this mess because of this pressure from the 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:34.009
 expiration 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:34.009
 we have a glass here 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.600
 to the single day 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.530
 and a 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:46.340
 He passed 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:48.249
 - means that the bacteria is 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:51.410
 involved 

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:56.390
 the painful step that is 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:56.390
 remember if good 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.650
 in the case of birds 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.490
 one 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:20.010
 the coffers do not have pulmonary alveoli 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:20.010
 they own one they call walking is 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:27.259
 seeing this gender structure 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:30.409
 quite up above are not images at 

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:33.580
 lack of this tree imagine that the 

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:33.580
 lung vessels 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.099
 if I was born 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:40.490
 and this comes as with small 

00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:40.490
 perforations 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.850
 I do not know if I know 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:55.890
 inspires we had already said that it went from 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:58.290
 Monaco and extend to the bone in the 

00:06:55.890 --> 00:07:00.849
 moment that the bedex saves when he 

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:03.180
 I'm exhaling 

00:07:00.849 --> 00:07:05.449
 here is 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:08.409
 he stays as a child 

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:08.409
 and the signs 

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:18.830
 yes 

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:20.800
 I do not know if he did not feel the oxygen of his 

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:23.800
 part has taken off with these little 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.800
 coverages 

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:34.129
 then in this other part is also 

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:38.750
 releasing the 0-2 but it will not be for a 

00:07:34.129 --> 00:07:40.539
 pressure actually and apparatus 

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:43.539
 respiratory to give them in both 

00:07:40.539 --> 00:07:43.539
 deficient 

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:48.980
 but that's how the breath goes
