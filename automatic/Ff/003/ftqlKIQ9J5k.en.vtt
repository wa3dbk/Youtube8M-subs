to my abs with in almost 100 domination
points<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.210> fail<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.450> get<00:00:42.780> one<00:00:43.559> in<00:00:43.860> a

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
points and I fail to get one in a

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.310 
points and I fail to get one in a
hundred<00:00:44.280> domination<00:00:44.910> point<00:00:45.149> so<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.360> got<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.780> 100

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
hundred domination point so I got to 100

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.380 
hundred domination point so I got to 100
domination<00:00:46.860> points<00:00:47.129> but<00:00:47.280> failed<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.640> get<00:00:47.789> one

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
domination points but failed to get one

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.389 
domination points but failed to get one
and<00:00:48.750> that's<00:00:49.469> mainly<00:00:49.680> because<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:50.190> was<00:00:50.280> only

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
and that's mainly because it was only

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.119 
and that's mainly because it was only
four<00:00:50.760> people<00:00:51.180> um<00:00:51.449> in<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.050> game<00:00:52.410> for<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:52.949> first

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
four people um in the game for the first

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.100 
four people um in the game for the first
100<00:00:53.399> points<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.030> game<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.020> know

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
100 points of the game and you know

100 points of the game and you know
killing<00:00:55.649> four<00:00:55.949> people<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.550> not<00:00:57.390> fun<00:00:57.690> that's

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
killing four people is not fun that's

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.099
