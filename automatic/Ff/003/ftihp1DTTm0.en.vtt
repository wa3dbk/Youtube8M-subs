 I say it is a very special letter 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.660

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.450
 Because I'm scared 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.250
 that you are afraid 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:13.150

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.050
 [Laughs] 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.850
 what's wrong 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.260
 is that I can not stop thinking about the face 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.680
