00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
I think you still do it but I sensually

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.660 
I think you still do it but I sensually
gives<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:54.960> unlimited<00:00:55.170> prestige<00:00:55.649> tokens<00:00:56.460> and

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
they started banning for it but first of

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.910 
they started banning for it but first of
all<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.390> whole<00:01:00.420> reason<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:00.930> did<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.379> what<00:01:01.890> I

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
all the whole reason I did it is what I

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.039 
all the whole reason I did it is what I
can<00:01:02.190> get<00:01:02.340> some<00:01:02.550> shotgun<00:01:03.090> gameplays<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.570> I
