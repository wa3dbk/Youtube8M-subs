today i am going to be showing you guys
how<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:33.000> reduce<00:00:33.360> recoil<00:00:34.219> vertical<00:00:35.219> recoil

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
how to reduce recoil vertical recoil

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.819 
how to reduce recoil vertical recoil
with<00:00:35.820> guns<00:00:36.059> such<00:00:36.360> as<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.840> mp7<00:00:38.840> so<00:00:39.840> all<00:00:40.379> i<00:00:40.440> have

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
with guns such as the mp7 so all i have

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.220 
with guns such as the mp7 so all i have
in<00:00:40.950> my<00:00:41.070> class<00:00:41.399> as<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:41.879> can<00:00:42.059> see<00:00:42.270> here<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.690> the

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
in my class as you can see here is the

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.290 
in my class as you can see here is the
extended<00:00:43.559> clip<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.219> everything<00:00:45.120> else

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
extended clip and everything else

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.440 
extended clip and everything else
doesn't<00:00:45.510> really<00:00:45.750> matter<00:00:46.070> just<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.280> mp7<00:00:47.550> so

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
doesn't really matter just the mp7 so

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.729 
doesn't really matter just the mp7 so
what<00:00:48.750> i'm<00:00:48.809> going<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:48.960> show<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.170> guys<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:51.739> how

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
what i'm going to show you guys is how

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.689 
what i'm going to show you guys is how
to<00:00:52.800> reduce<00:00:53.219> recoil<00:00:53.610> without<00:00:54.570> using<00:00:54.989> for<00:00:55.410> grip

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
to reduce recoil without using for grip

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:58.189 
to reduce recoil without using for grip
so<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:56.760> don't<00:00:57.059> have<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.300> waste<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.660> extra

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
so you don't have to waste the extra

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:25.899 
so you don't have to waste the extra
create<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.590> class<00:00:58.859> token<00:00:59.300> on<00:01:00.300> it

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:49.419 

come<00:01:26.909> on<00:01:27.060> load<00:01:39.740> again<00:01:41.299> free<00:01:42.299> for<00:01:42.600> all<00:01:47.479> faithful

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:49.429

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:54.800 
come on load again free for all faithful
one<00:01:50.429> free<00:01:51.950> I<00:01:52.950> guess<00:01:53.819> I<00:01:53.970> Akashi<00:01:54.329> all<00:01:54.539> sort<00:01:54.780> of

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
one free I guess I Akashi all sort of

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.419 
one free I guess I Akashi all sort of
the<00:01:54.959> map<00:01:55.140> that'd<00:01:55.470> be<00:01:55.500> good<00:01:55.829> so<00:01:56.099> I'm<00:01:56.189> just<00:01:56.310> going

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:56.429 
the map that'd be good so I'm just going

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:59.870 
the map that'd be good so I'm just going
to<00:01:56.489> kill<00:01:56.670> myself<00:01:56.849> in<00:01:58.310> that<00:01:59.310> can<00:01:59.549> already<00:01:59.670> walk

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
to kill myself in that can already walk

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:07.359 
to kill myself in that can already walk
anyways<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:04.880> thought<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:05.909> put<00:02:06.119> on<00:02:06.209> the<00:02:06.299> time

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
anyways I thought I put on the time

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.400 
anyways I thought I put on the time
maybe<00:02:08.369> didn't<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.789> guess<00:02:09.420> we're<00:02:09.599> going<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.840> test

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
maybe didn't I guess we're going to test

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.110 
maybe didn't I guess we're going to test
it<00:02:11.150> so<00:02:12.410> if<00:02:13.410> you're<00:02:13.739> gonna<00:02:13.890> just<00:02:14.160> shoot<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.790> mp7

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
it so if you're gonna just shoot the mp7

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.339 
it so if you're gonna just shoot the mp7
normally<00:02:15.810> this<00:02:16.079> is<00:02:16.140> a<00:02:16.319> lovely

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.890 

notice<00:02:21.349> how<00:02:21.409> that<00:02:21.439> goes<00:02:21.680> upwards<00:02:22.189> now<00:02:23.090> like

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
notice how that goes upwards now like

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.289 
notice how that goes upwards now like
vertically<00:02:24.769> upwards<00:02:25.129> now<00:02:25.730> if<00:02:25.909> you<00:02:26.060> use<00:02:26.180> the

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
vertically upwards now if you use the

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.210 
vertically upwards now if you use the
right<00:02:26.450> thumbstick<00:02:26.840> of<00:02:27.290> your<00:02:27.500> controller<00:02:27.920> and

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
right thumbstick of your controller and

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.340 
right thumbstick of your controller and
push<00:02:28.790> it<00:02:28.939> down<00:02:29.060> while<00:02:29.299> you're<00:02:29.480> shooting

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.090 

and<00:02:35.330> that<00:02:36.330> is<00:02:36.570> really<00:02:37.230> good<00:02:37.380> compared<00:02:37.830> to<00:02:37.920> that

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
and that is really good compared to that

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.690 
and that is really good compared to that
that<00:02:38.610> range<00:02:39.000> from<00:02:39.180> here<00:02:39.690> to<00:02:40.230> there<00:02:40.590> well<00:02:41.430> that

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
that range from here to there well that

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.600 
that range from here to there well that
is<00:02:41.940> only<00:02:42.150> them<00:02:42.650> so<00:02:43.650> in<00:02:43.800> my<00:02:43.950> opinion<00:02:44.010> that<00:02:44.310> is

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
is only them so in my opinion that is

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.700 
is only them so in my opinion that is
awesome<00:02:45.080> so<00:02:46.080> now<00:02:46.200> i'm<00:02:46.320> going<00:02:46.380> to<00:02:46.530> show<00:02:46.680> you
