sand<00:01:29.899> it'd<00:01:30.890> be<00:01:31.130> hard<00:01:31.430> not<00:01:31.580> to<00:01:31.820> go<00:01:31.970> with<00:01:32.119> Barcia

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
sand it'd be hard not to go with Barcia

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.870 
sand it'd be hard not to go with Barcia
and<00:01:32.869> on<00:01:33.680> top<00:01:33.890> of<00:01:33.920> that<00:01:34.100> Barcia<00:01:34.490> is<00:01:34.550> a<00:01:34.610> great

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
and on top of that Barcia is a great

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.109 
and on top of that Barcia is a great
starter<00:01:35.390> and<00:01:35.570> I<00:01:36.440> do<00:01:36.710> think<00:01:37.130> that<00:01:37.220> Baggett<00:01:37.790> will

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
starter and I do think that Baggett will

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:39.850 
starter and I do think that Baggett will
struggle<00:01:38.479> at<00:01:38.750> the<00:01:38.869> nation's<00:01:39.290> being<00:01:39.649> on<00:01:39.830> a

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
struggle at the nation's being on a

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.219 
struggle at the nation's being on a
smaller<00:01:40.340> bike<00:01:40.670> and<00:01:40.940> trying<00:01:41.750> to<00:01:41.869> come<00:01:42.080> to

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
smaller bike and trying to come to

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.650 
smaller bike and trying to come to
traffic<00:01:42.830> with<00:01:43.460> Barcia<00:01:44.090> I<00:01:44.179> think<00:01:44.420> you<00:01:44.509> could

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
traffic with Barcia I think you could

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.930 
traffic with Barcia I think you could
see<00:01:44.810> him<00:01:44.990> get<00:01:45.200> a<00:01:45.229> better<00:01:45.440> start<00:01:45.830> even<00:01:46.729> on<00:01:46.850> the

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
see him get a better start even on the

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.870 
see him get a better start even on the
250<00:01:47.450> and<00:01:47.690> do<00:01:48.170> a<00:01:48.200> lot<00:01:48.380> better<00:01:48.590> so<00:01:48.860> you<00:01:49.759> know

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
250 and do a lot better so you know

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.400 
250 and do a lot better so you know
right<00:01:50.119> now<00:01:50.270> Baggett<00:01:50.720> seems<00:01:50.960> to<00:01:51.050> be<00:01:51.140> the<00:01:51.259> guy<00:01:51.380> to

time<00:02:30.950> I<00:02:30.980> ride<00:02:31.280> a<00:02:31.310> two-stroke<00:02:31.790> still<00:02:32.120> this<00:02:32.270> day

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
time I ride a two-stroke still this day

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.059 
time I ride a two-stroke still this day
I<00:02:32.540> feel<00:02:32.660> like<00:02:32.870> I<00:02:33.050> can<00:02:33.140> go<00:02:33.230> faster<00:02:33.680> on<00:02:33.709> it<00:02:33.950> it's

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
I feel like I can go faster on it it's

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.089 
I feel like I can go faster on it it's
just<00:02:34.130> not<00:02:34.280> faster<00:02:34.819> on<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:35.000> clock<00:02:35.240> but<00:02:36.080> um<00:02:36.260> you

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
just not faster on the clock but um you

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:39.130 
just not faster on the clock but um you
know<00:02:37.130> I<00:02:37.250> love<00:02:37.640> two<00:02:37.970> strokes<00:02:38.330> I<00:02:38.569> definitely

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
know I love two strokes I definitely

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.690 
know I love two strokes I definitely
think<00:02:39.349> that<00:02:39.500> this<00:02:39.950> floor<00:02:40.160> would<00:02:40.280> be<00:02:40.340> a<00:02:40.459> lot

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
think that this floor would be a lot

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.610 
think that this floor would be a lot
funner<00:02:40.940> if<00:02:41.120> it<00:02:41.240> was<00:02:41.330> two<00:02:41.510> strokes<00:02:41.840> a<00:02:42.020> lot<00:02:42.170> less

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
funner if it was two strokes a lot less

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.040 
funner if it was two strokes a lot less
expensive<00:02:43.250> so<00:02:43.819> I'd<00:02:43.970> say<00:02:44.270> there's<00:02:44.870> nothing

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
expensive so I'd say there's nothing

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.400 
expensive so I'd say there's nothing
like<00:02:45.230> a<00:02:45.380> good<00:02:45.590> clean<00:02:45.800> running<00:02:46.130> to

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
like a good clean running to

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.540 
like a good clean running to

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
we are nothing but a bike not even a

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.260 
we are nothing but a bike not even a
bike<00:03:05.200> link<00:03:05.470> apart<00:03:05.770> just<00:03:05.950> wire-to-wire<00:03:06.730> and<00:03:07.240> I

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
bike link apart just wire-to-wire and I

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.570 
bike link apart just wire-to-wire and I
ended<00:03:07.390> up<00:03:07.510> finishing<00:03:07.780> I<00:03:08.320> only<00:03:08.830> I<00:03:08.920> think<00:03:09.130> I

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
ended up finishing I only I think I

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.400 
ended up finishing I only I think I
don't<00:03:10.390> know<00:03:10.450> they<00:03:10.570> couldn't<00:03:10.870> even<00:03:10.930> tell<00:03:11.170> who

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
don't know they couldn't even tell who

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.050 
don't know they couldn't even tell who
won<00:03:11.650> until<00:03:11.890> they<00:03:12.100> looked<00:03:12.310> at<00:03:12.430> the<00:03:12.520> score<00:03:12.820> sheet

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
won until they looked at the score sheet

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.730 
won until they looked at the score sheet
how<00:03:13.180> close<00:03:13.420> it<00:03:13.600> was<00:03:13.630> at<00:03:13.870> the<00:03:13.930> finish<00:03:14.080> but<00:03:14.410> I

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
how close it was at the finish but I

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.740 
how close it was at the finish but I
mean<00:03:15.070> I<00:03:15.130> could<00:03:15.310> have<00:03:15.370> swore<00:03:15.910> sometimes<00:03:16.480> I

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
mean I could have swore sometimes I

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.750 
mean I could have swore sometimes I
