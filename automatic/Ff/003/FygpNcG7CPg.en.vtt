 the cable 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.290
 the Brazilian dairy farming faces a transitional period the attacker 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.910
 with the change in the legislation on the quality of dairy products 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.670
 much more demanding 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.430
 these determinant changes every milk producer must be aware of the 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.549
 quality parameters adopted 

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:06.220
 knowing the control mechanisms 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.260
 in this video course you will know in detail the new requirements regarding 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.280
 refrigerated raw milk and all relevant new 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.500
 will understand all the tests done in the milk collection and then inside the 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.590
 dairy products 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.800
 will know in depth how the contaminations occur and how it is done 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.180
 standard counting and plaques and the somatic cell count 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.420
 relationship with the day to day on the farm that the influence on the chain 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.600
 production of dairy products 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.780

 milk cattle 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.500
 over time man has managed to create an animal capable of producing a 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.240
 quantity of milk much higher than the needs of its 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.719
 the milk that in addition to giving birth has a high nutritional value for the human being 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.679
 several foods are digested by the vacancy that uses part of the nutrients 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.810
 obtained for the fulfillment of their needs and part for the production 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.029
 of milk 

00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:20.699
 through the fema maria that carry the blood to the mammary gland a great 

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:25.389
 amount of energy transported from the blow also from the liver 

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:30.579
 the food ingested passes through the intestines so they are absorbed and 

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:35.329
 transported to the udder when you time mineral proteins in 30 minutes 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:39.609
 the water left doubt is also taken to the mammary gland 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:45.370
 as part of the body's body fat and will turn into fat in the 

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:46.339
 milk 

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:50.779
 the digestion of a number of nutrients ends in the liver from which the 

00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:51.630
 glucose 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.630
 and the mammary gland will be transformed into more than 12 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:03:00.009
 all these nutrients in a fantastic way are blended during the 

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:03.009
 synthesis of milk inside the mammary gland 

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:08.669
 the milk that in the healthy animals has high standard while it is stored 

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:09.529
 in the udder 

00:03:09.529 --> 00:03:13.699
 but that will deteriorate sabbath is interpreted by mastitis pathogens 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:17.819
 if there is presence of chemical residues in your body 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.129
 and if milking is not carried out in good hygiene conditions by committing the 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.909
