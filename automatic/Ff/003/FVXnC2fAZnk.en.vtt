00:00:10.529 --> 00:00:13.529
 tonight a night at the museum 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:18.509
 representing almost 2% 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:19.939
 that's all 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.069
 so in fact of two first pieces to spread this ex-palace account it's 

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:24.759
 so a piece where I speak 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:26.550
 as a rule of respect for women 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.179
 five other people affected 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:31.019
 more in rap it is not often seen it happens so that already me 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.949
 I really wanted so that since pleasant to put it in images 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:36.750
 martin 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.750
 France 3 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.990
 he will be accompanied by six months 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.440
 the second set the oriental 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.660
 and his clique 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.500
 the fight was shot to slow to hide 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.760
 this one is more for the festive side and also to participate with my 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.760
 friend but also will not shoot with me on this piece there 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.170
 honestly, no 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.200
 3rd living room that is important to me but also 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.240
 something that is natural to me 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.160
 but we always go good ducks and hens stairwell there is actually 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.940
 I did not understand I did not want to say that 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.280
 I do not look like that so I'm completely equal to myself 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.410
 and yes oath that is close to my heart because few people want to 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.790
 to share and that people do not amalgamate what europe is the icon 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.130
 codified and I would also like people to understand that in rap we 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.110
 also speaks of beautiful things we are family man we have a lot of 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.860
 feelings 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.359
 but it will still follow 

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:09.359
 obama asked m 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.909
 we must have children 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:15.569
 library 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.799
 libreville 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.799
 in 18 months 

00:02:44.529 --> 00:02:46.790

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.169
 yes I came to tell you that we can drink water 

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:52.009
 the tournament will be held in marrakech was close to me it's me who 

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:53.070
 wrote the synopsis 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.060
 so I planned to do the test is not right left at oussouye 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.640
 godmother who was hoping to put all this after the ol I wanted to make a wink 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.660
 to perpignan because it's important because for the body we 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.700
 put the team is called the Eastern and Eastern c &amp; a also because we do 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.860
 part of the eastern Pyrenees so I wanted to wink 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.470
 acea m of course moment and historical monument it was necessary that this 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.850
 in front of the castillet and the shooting of the castillet also was very 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.810
 well done and it went well there are women who are very small 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.930
 to join to see them elsewhere in the clip the afp so thanks to them 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.150
 have become a duo super positive with oneself that we are turned in africa or 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.799
 France was so great 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.799
 and if you want to see the agenda 

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:39.259
 Why 

00:03:41.779 --> 00:03:44.779
 wrongly 

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:55.369
 dominique dord 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.860
 one of the particularities 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.860
 live stage groups 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.949
 lafleur guy yes it's something I want to continue to land and get 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:36.449
 was 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:39.039
 and that's something I will not let go 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:42.619
 although before the configuration of the microphones didier I liked a lot but there 

00:04:42.619 --> 00:04:45.509
 now with the instruments it's completely off the vibrator at 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:48.849
 it's something it's exceptional but it's us what we 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:52.460
 is trying to break through to defend the album so the arcade minutes the cable to 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.879
 through the father stage of stage performances because 

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:59.919
 everything is completely different people who come to see us live I 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:03.490
 I would never have thought his little beast like that I did not hear that 

00:05:03.489 --> 00:05:06.400
 actually on the album except the messages that itself 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.580
 so we continue or in live acoustic training that's for sure 

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:11.080
 I believe in myself
