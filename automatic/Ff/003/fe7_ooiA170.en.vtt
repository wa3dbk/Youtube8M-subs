00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
then a few years ago I got my first 3d

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.389 
then a few years ago I got my first 3d
mouse<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.750> was<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.960> space<00:00:55.320> navigator<00:00:55.890> from<00:00:56.129> 3d

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399

connection<00:00:56.879> for<00:00:57.539> such<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.690> simple<00:00:58.109> tool<00:00:58.559> it

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
connection for such a simple tool it

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.709 
connection for such a simple tool it
made<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:58.920> huge<00:00:59.399> difference<00:00:59.640> in<00:00:59.940> my<00:01:00.090> workflow

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
made a huge difference in my workflow

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.869 
made a huge difference in my workflow
I<00:01:00.750> was<00:01:01.109> working<00:01:01.440> faster<00:01:02.070> spending<00:01:02.520> more<00:01:02.670> time

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
I was working faster spending more time

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.329 
I was working faster spending more time
actually<00:01:03.539> modeling<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.229> less<00:01:04.650> time<00:01:04.949> fighting

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
actually modeling and less time fighting

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.429 
actually modeling and less time fighting
the<00:01:05.640> software<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.750> was<00:01:06.869> actually<00:01:07.020> more

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
the software and I was actually more

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.020 
the software and I was actually more
comfortable<00:01:08.010> at<00:01:08.100> my<00:01:08.189> desk<00:01:08.490> because<00:01:08.760> the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
comfortable at my desk because the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.149 
comfortable at my desk because the
workload<00:01:09.510> was<00:01:09.540> being<00:01:10.140> shared<00:01:10.439> between<00:01:10.740> my<00:01:11.100> two

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
workload was being shared between my two

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.060 
workload was being shared between my two
hands<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.970> as<00:01:12.780> strange<00:01:13.320> as<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:13.590> sounds<00:01:13.650> I

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
hands and as strange as this sounds I

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.609 
hands and as strange as this sounds I
felt<00:01:14.610> more<00:01:14.820> connected<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.600> my<00:01:15.689> models<00:01:16.200> not

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
felt more connected to my models not

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.350 
felt more connected to my models not
only<00:01:16.680> did<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.100> have<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.340> feeling<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:17.850> physically

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
only did I have a feeling of physically

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.600 
only did I have a feeling of physically
interacting<00:01:19.020> with<00:01:19.170> my<00:01:19.290> virtual<00:01:19.710> objects<00:01:20.159> but

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
interacting with my virtual objects but

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.789 
interacting with my virtual objects but
the<00:01:20.729> movement<00:01:21.299> being<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:21.689> natural<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.380> smooth

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
the movement being so natural and smooth

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.100 
the movement being so natural and smooth
not<00:01:23.100> sharp<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.939> jerky<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.720> makes<00:01:24.930> working

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
not sharp and jerky it makes working

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.800 
not sharp and jerky it makes working
with<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.350> model<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:26.130> much<00:01:26.340> more<00:01:26.580> immersive<00:01:26.880> so

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
with a model so much more immersive so

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.060 
with a model so much more immersive so
let's<00:01:27.990> say<00:01:28.110> you're<00:01:28.290> ready<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.590> get<00:01:28.680> your<00:01:28.740> first
