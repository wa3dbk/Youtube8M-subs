00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:07.299
 hello I'm from elsewhere magazine 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:23.480
 hi to all i'm with reminder for 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:25.039
 tell you about battlefield four mornings 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.829
 yarn 4 one of the big fat 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.439
 sensations of 7.3 2013 behind us there 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:31.369
 there are 75 64 people who are in the process of 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.649
 play multi player 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.300
 alas the commander mode we will you 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.400
 to speak first of what we have seen is the 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.530
 solo we first saw a big mission 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.390
 solo so that's going on in one in a 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.250
 aircraft carrier trains are in the process of 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.390
 what did you think of me? 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.590
 I found that unlike the 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.500
 first assignment shown us 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.630
 a few months ago we come back on 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.740
 something a little over a year of 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.510
 more interesting because there is some 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.070
 physics we send planes that 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.360
 was crumbling all that yeah that's it 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.410
 can shoot plane holds for 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.420
 to make them collapse on friends 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.790
 exactly is actually here it's done 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.140
 that we reuse dice reuses a 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.689
 again his engine so 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.159
 smart for to give 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:10.200
 new keys to interactions 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.630
 with the decor it's exactly 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.039
 we can also give 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.450
 orders to his teams to his team of 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:16.710
 rudimentary order go by there go 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.659
 so here to a dimension a little 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.399
 strategic who is technically nice 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.020
 it's really dazzling even at night 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:23.670
 even in a level that normally 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.229
 night levels is not doing very well and 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.520
 after had a whole phase on a 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.170
 boat that was good it was not the 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.159
 stage on rail at the call of duty because 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.959
 we control is really the boat 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.969
 but really what was the sensation 

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:36.179
 of 7.3 this is the multiplayer of 

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:38.609
 battlefield 4 it turns it's super beautiful 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:40.500
 we have seen a map that is huge 

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:41.939
 it's an entire city is there as said 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.560
 raphael it's all destructible 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.289
 then more than a whole city life 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.219
 it is rather an entire neighborhood but the 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:49.379
 more interesting is that there is a 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:51.299
 building that collapses in the end when 

00:01:49.379 --> 00:01:52.679
 one of the parkings of the teams to win 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.500
 it's not a script 1 it's really 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:56.700
 howey to face valence because that's 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.849
 a bombing was provoked by the 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.319
 others yes if you want we'll see but from 

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:03.209
 Anyway it's still super bowl 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:04.739
 64 players at the same time someone map a 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:06.179
 mac is gigantic with tons of 

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:07.940
 possibilities so yes battlefield us 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:09.629
 has already got used to that but there 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.619
 technically speaking it's fine at 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.780
 above what we saw in particular 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.920
 at title yes quite and what is 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.849
 still interesting with this engine 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.799
 physical is really going on 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:18.299
 super things on the screen for example one 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:20.069
 can shoot on pillars for them for 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.209
 collapse a tank in the basement 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.859
 and I think there are plenty of others 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.150
 interactions to discover me there are 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:26.180
 also this side we can find ourselves in 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.260
 a plane jump in parachute 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.209
 arrived on an enemy zone pull from 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.519
 high finally there are battlefields or 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.470
 Huawei battlefield in the big candy 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.120
 battlefield and novelty this is the 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.769
 return of the commander mode wiimote 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.319
 commander who allows one of the players of 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.159
 each team ii 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.420
 direct operations and have 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:45.980
 the kills finally not to help 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.810
 additional skills and in particular 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.400
 bombed if needed once he has 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.659
 that they who reached seven animals and 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.989
 that so many enemies have been 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:53.120
 you are 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.680
 it allows him to swing bombs 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.060
 directly on the city and therefore 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.840
 give orders to his teams to say 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.549
 there's more going in this direction 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.049
 be careful there is a squad of 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.790
 things like that it's really not bad 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.379
 and another things too 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.540
 interesting about battlefield 4 that's 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:07.250
 the use of the tablet for this 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.900
 Commander mode for Commander mode 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.980
 and so it's also a big 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.930
 announcements of the e3 we put that on 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.150
 assassin's creed we saw it on watchdog 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.620
 we saw that on this young crime so 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.319
 it's still one of the news 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.329
 trends with the kop all the time the 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.379
 28 or the time that this is what is 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:26.359
 so here's a brief battlefield four years 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:27.919
 a very serious postulant in the title 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:30.469
 of the e3 2013 

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:32.659
 there is an incredible tail to play 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:35.769
 a lot of people talk about it very very 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:35.769
 big sensation to more 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.190
 no
