today I'm gonna show you how to draw
heart<00:00:08.970> designs<00:00:09.330> today<00:00:10.260> we'll<00:00:10.500> be<00:00:10.769> drawing

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
heart designs today we'll be drawing

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.459 
heart designs today we'll be drawing
with<00:00:11.219> soft<00:00:11.580> compressed<00:00:12.210> charcoal<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:13.139> reason

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
with soft compressed charcoal the reason

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.740 
with soft compressed charcoal the reason
I<00:00:13.679> like<00:00:13.889> this<00:00:14.009> material<00:00:14.219> so<00:00:14.700> much<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:15.480> that<00:00:15.660> it

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
I like this material so much is that it

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.960 
I like this material so much is that it
gives<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.990> smooth<00:00:16.289> bold<00:00:16.710> line<00:00:17.039> and<00:00:17.850> you<00:00:17.940> can

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
gives a smooth bold line and you can

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.550 
gives a smooth bold line and you can
modulate<00:00:18.270> it<00:00:18.600> very<00:00:18.779> easily<00:00:18.990> with<00:00:19.289> pressure

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
modulate it very easily with pressure

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.650 
modulate it very easily with pressure
and<00:00:20.520> any<00:00:20.699> marks<00:00:21.029> that<00:00:21.119> you're<00:00:21.240> unhappy<00:00:21.480> with

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
and any marks that you're unhappy with

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.450 
and any marks that you're unhappy with
can<00:00:21.990> be<00:00:22.020> erased<00:00:22.410> simply<00:00:22.859> using<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.189> kneaded

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
can be erased simply using a kneaded

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.429 
can be erased simply using a kneaded
eraser<00:00:23.519> which<00:00:24.300> is<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.539> best<00:00:24.720> eraser<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.260> use

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
eraser which is the best eraser to use

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.759 
eraser which is the best eraser to use
for<00:00:26.220> compressed<00:00:26.580> charcoal<00:00:27.199> now<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.230> heart<00:00:28.590> is

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
for compressed charcoal now a heart is

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.500 
for compressed charcoal now a heart is
really<00:00:28.980> best<00:00:29.369> understood<00:00:29.820> breaking<00:00:30.269> it<00:00:30.359> down

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
really best understood breaking it down

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.600 
really best understood breaking it down
into<00:00:30.570> its<00:00:30.960> two<00:00:31.170> most<00:00:31.380> simple<00:00:31.769> forms<00:00:32.099> so<00:00:32.520> we'll

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
into its two most simple forms so we'll

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.170 
into its two most simple forms so we'll
draw<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.850> line<00:00:33.120> down<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.360> middle<00:00:33.480> of<00:00:33.809> it

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
draw a line down the middle of it

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.310 
draw a line down the middle of it
separating<00:00:36.180> those<00:00:36.329> forms<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:36.809> there's<00:00:36.989> two

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
separating those forms and there's two

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.970 
separating those forms and there's two
very<00:00:37.680> basic<00:00:37.890> lines<00:00:39.469> there<00:00:40.469> will<00:00:40.559> be<00:00:40.590> an<00:00:40.739> arch

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
very basic lines there will be an arch

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.940 
very basic lines there will be an arch
and<00:00:41.219> then<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.239> arch<00:00:42.450> just<00:00:42.809> comes<00:00:43.379> right<00:00:43.739> back

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
and then the arch just comes right back

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.959 
and then the arch just comes right back
down<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.219> center<00:00:45.110> on<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.320> other<00:00:46.469> side<00:00:46.739> try<00:00:47.700> as

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
down the center on the other side try as

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.639 
down the center on the other side try as
well<00:00:48.360> as<00:00:48.510> possible<00:00:48.930> if<00:00:49.050> just<00:00:49.200> imagine<00:00:49.530> you're

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
well as possible if just imagine you're

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.110 
well as possible if just imagine you're
a<00:00:49.680> mirror<00:00:50.039> making<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.460> same<00:00:50.670> lines<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.059> just

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
a mirror making the same lines you just

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.549 
a mirror making the same lines you just
did<00:00:51.390> in<00:00:51.480> Reverse<00:00:52.760> arch<00:00:54.050> back<00:00:55.050> down<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
did in Reverse arch back down to the

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.790 
did in Reverse arch back down to the
middle<00:00:56.690> now<00:00:57.690> if<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:57.870> was<00:00:57.989> successful<00:00:58.530> you

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
middle now if that was successful you

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.410 
middle now if that was successful you
can<00:00:58.949> measure<00:00:59.100> with<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.370> ruler<00:00:59.460> weirdest

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
can measure with a ruler weirdest

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.560 
can measure with a ruler weirdest
utensil<00:01:00.930> see<00:01:01.920> if<00:01:02.070> those<00:01:02.219> were<00:01:02.430> really<00:01:02.760> as<00:01:02.940> even

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
utensil see if those were really as even

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.590 
utensil see if those were really as even
as<00:01:03.690> you'd<00:01:03.809> hoped<00:01:04.019> for<00:01:04.369> I'm<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.430> little<00:01:05.760> off<00:01:05.909> but

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
as you'd hoped for I'm a little off but

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.789 
as you'd hoped for I'm a little off but
I<00:01:06.659> think<00:01:06.900> for<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.140> purposes<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.619> illustration

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
I think for the purposes of illustration

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.820 
I think for the purposes of illustration
fine<00:01:08.960> so<00:01:09.960> now<00:01:10.080> I'm<00:01:10.350> going<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.650> demonstrate

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
fine so now I'm going to demonstrate

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.039 
fine so now I'm going to demonstrate
some<00:01:11.189> design<00:01:11.790> work<00:01:11.820> on<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.510> basic<00:01:12.840> heart

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
some design work on the basic heart

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.050 
some design work on the basic heart
shape<00:01:13.700> again<00:01:14.700> starting<00:01:15.119> from<00:01:15.150> your<00:01:15.390> top<00:01:15.630> point

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
shape again starting from your top point

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:26.260 
shape again starting from your top point
an<00:01:18.060> arch<00:01:18.390> down<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.619> bottom<00:01:20.180> and<00:01:21.180> arch<00:01:22.640> down<00:01:23.640> to

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.819 

now<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.330> most<00:01:27.570> common<00:01:27.990> method<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.530> making

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
now the most common method of making

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.950 
now the most common method of making
design<00:01:29.250> out<00:01:29.400> of<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.579> heart<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:30.509> repeating

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
design out of a heart is repeating

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:41.990 
design out of a heart is repeating
patterns<00:01:31.640> make<00:01:32.640> another<00:01:32.880> heart

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.270 

make<00:01:43.000> another<00:01:43.210> one<00:01:43.360> this<00:01:43.600> time<00:01:44.040> let's<00:01:45.040> try<00:01:45.250> a

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
make another one this time let's try a

00:01:45.280 --> 00:02:00.830 
make another one this time let's try a
wavy<00:01:45.490> line<00:01:45.610> see<00:01:46.000> what<00:01:46.090> happens

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.090 

now<00:02:01.840> you<00:02:01.899> can<00:02:02.110> continue<00:02:02.409> these<00:02:02.649> patterns

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
now you can continue these patterns

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.069 
now you can continue these patterns
until<00:02:04.090> you<00:02:04.180> get<00:02:04.329> something<00:02:04.750> that<00:02:04.930> you're

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
until you get something that you're

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:07.709 
until you get something that you're
impressed<00:02:05.409> with<00:02:05.969> you<00:02:06.969> can<00:02:07.119> even<00:02:07.240> add<00:02:07.420> shading

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:07.719 
impressed with you can even add shading

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:14.580 
impressed with you can even add shading
here's<00:02:08.379> what<00:02:08.500> I<00:02:08.560> drew<00:02:08.739> earlier<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:14.170> that<00:02:14.200> is

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
here's what I drew earlier and that is

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.970 
here's what I drew earlier and that is
how<00:02:14.950> to<00:02:15.010> draw<00:02:15.190> our<00:02:15.640> design
