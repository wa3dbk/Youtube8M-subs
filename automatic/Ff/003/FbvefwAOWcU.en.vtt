00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
the discord one or maybe they just

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.750 
the discord one or maybe they just
didn't<00:01:03.449> show<00:01:03.480> it<00:01:03.690> but<00:01:04.019> as<00:01:05.010> far<00:01:05.220> as<00:01:05.280> i<00:01:05.580> know<00:01:05.640> i

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
didn't show it but as far as i know i

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.300

episode<00:01:12.830> but<00:01:13.830> who<00:01:14.159> knows<00:01:14.400> maybe<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.270> seeing

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
episode but who knows maybe it is seeing

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.600 
episode but who knows maybe it is seeing
how<00:01:15.960> they<00:01:16.110> might<00:01:16.290> not<00:01:16.500> want<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.680> give<00:01:16.830> her<00:01:17.280> I

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
how they might not want to give her I

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.520 
how they might not want to give her I
don't<00:01:17.850> know<00:01:17.909> like<00:01:17.970> three<00:01:18.570> at<00:01:18.930> focusing

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
don't know like three at focusing

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.260 
don't know like three at focusing
episodes<00:01:20.360> because<00:01:21.360> she<00:01:21.600> had<00:01:21.720> further<00:01:21.990> bad<00:01:22.290> and

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
episodes because she had further bad and

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.490 
episodes because she had further bad and
she<00:01:24.270> had<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:25.110> pony<00:01:25.350> tunes<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.990> she<00:01:27.990> has<00:01:28.259> this
