00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:14.350
 hello compadre is here we are once 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.470
 more thanks for all the support is 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:20.259
 receiving lots and lots of the 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.849
 Spanish forums I channel 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:24.759
 receiving many questions and we are going to 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:26.320
 start answering questions coming from 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:30.070
 here we have a gun we are going to 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.800
 disarm it the question says with what eye 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.920
 I have to shoot as I know what my 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:39.460
 dominant eye that is very easy to know 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:43.180
 look at people assembling this gun look 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.900
 here we have the sights of back and of 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.430
 in front 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:50.410
 in front of you saw then how do I know that 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.030
 eye I have to use to shoot myself 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.280
 I have a left dominant eye 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.290
 then look what they should do 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.079
 you are with both eyes open 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:02.340
 point to an objective the objective is 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:05.770
 the camera and then I'm going to point you 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:08.860
 with both eyes open I'm 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:12.310
 aligning the camera with the look 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.230
 in front the back look now what 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.440
 what they have to do is close one eye 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:21.190
 the right eye looks at it and in the camera 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.300
 follow exactly one in a line 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.680
 vertical 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.770
 if I close my left eye 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.940
 it looks totally misaligned I have it 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.910
 to adjust like that then if you see 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:37.400
 when I open the other two eyes another 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:40.729
 time then I have to line up another 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:45.130
 So, then, then, Chihuahua, we see how 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:47.770
 is itching then as you see 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.480
 I did not forget what he is getting 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.300
 then again 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:57.260
 with two open eyes they line up 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:02:00.440
 you look with the camera you saw it now 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:03.320
 close or open the right eye or the 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:07.030
 left with the eye that you see that 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:10.280
 the line continues vertical that his eye 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.510
 dominant if you have to correct 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.719
 the 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:19.030
 look that is not the dominant eye then 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:22.870
 that 's the way you know 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.510
 as what your dominant eye to 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.310
 know with what eyes they should shoot 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.760
 revolvers or pistols 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:35.800
 semiautomatic for rifles you 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.720
 they can use the non- dominant eye because 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.180
 because one with the rifle is like that 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.060
 so I have a dominant eye 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:48.720
 left but as the right eye is 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.720
 closest to me from me 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:56.720
 from my cheek then it's made to me 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:00.530
 easier to shoot with the right eye 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:03.890
 then many people shoot with the 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.500
 eye does not dominate the rifles unless 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:10.190
 want to use it 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:13.070
 the rifle in on the left side but I 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.410
 As I am right, I like to support myself 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.210
 in the on the right side but also what 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.210
 they can do but then they must use 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:23.060
 the hand I do not dominate to tighten 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:25.010
 the trigger sometimes that I do not like 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.590
 that does not follow me with the right does not 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.890
 I can paste my left mixes with the 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.290
 shotguns you must shoot with 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.210
 both eyes open let's make some 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.430
 Shotgun videos for you to see 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.940
 Well then I'm going there we'll see each other 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.940
 he goodbye 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:48.449
