00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
there's two at the front which will

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.490 
there's two at the front which will
intake<00:01:09.850> the<00:01:10.000> year<00:01:10.210> so<00:01:10.810> you're<00:01:10.990> going<00:01:11.170> to<00:01:11.289> get

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
intake the year so you're going to get

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.880 
intake the year so you're going to get
great<00:01:12.160> circulation<00:01:13.149> of<00:01:13.509> air<00:01:13.869> inside<00:01:14.619> this

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
great circulation of air inside this

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.340 
great circulation of air inside this
case<00:01:15.160> at<00:01:15.940> the<00:01:16.060> back<00:01:16.240> of<00:01:16.270> the<00:01:16.450> case<00:01:16.720> at<00:01:16.990> the<00:01:17.140> very

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
case at the back of the case at the very

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.050 
case at the back of the case at the very
top<00:01:17.619> is<00:01:17.679> where<00:01:18.070> you<00:01:18.220> install<00:01:18.610> the<00:01:18.820> power

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
top is where you install the power

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.240 
top is where you install the power
supply<00:01:19.360> and<00:01:19.780> they<00:01:20.050> have<00:01:20.229> included<00:01:20.710> a<00:01:20.830> couple

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
supply and they have included a couple

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.460 
supply and they have included a couple
of<00:01:21.399> different<00:01:21.759> brackets<00:01:22.000> now<00:01:22.659> how<00:01:22.900> this<00:01:23.170> works

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
of different brackets now how this works

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.789 
of different brackets now how this works
is<00:01:23.710> like<00:01:24.189> so<00:01:24.490> you<00:01:24.729> take<00:01:25.240> this<00:01:25.750> bracket<00:01:26.500> you

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
is like so you take this bracket you

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:29.219 
is like so you take this bracket you
attach<00:01:27.189> it<00:01:27.220> to<00:01:27.580> the<00:01:27.850> power<00:01:28.030> supply<00:01:28.330> then<00:01:29.080> you

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
attach it to the power supply then you

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.050 
attach it to the power supply then you
take<00:01:29.439> the<00:01:29.500> bracket<00:01:29.950> which<00:01:30.490> is<00:01:30.640> attached<00:01:30.909> to

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
take the bracket which is attached to

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.789 
take the bracket which is attached to
the<00:01:31.180> power<00:01:31.360> supply<00:01:31.540> bring<00:01:32.229> it<00:01:32.350> back<00:01:32.530> to<00:01:32.710> the

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
the power supply bring it back to the

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:35.010 
the power supply bring it back to the
case<00:01:33.009> and<00:01:33.189> just<00:01:33.700> screw<00:01:34.150> it<00:01:34.299> in<00:01:34.390> it<00:01:34.630> just<00:01:34.869> makes

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
case and just screw it in it just makes

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.499 
case and just screw it in it just makes
it<00:01:35.200> a<00:01:35.259> little<00:01:35.560> simpler<00:01:35.950> to<00:01:36.189> do<00:01:36.340> that<00:01:36.579> way<00:01:36.759> also

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
it a little simpler to do that way also

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:38.969 
it a little simpler to do that way also
you<00:01:37.570> will<00:01:37.780> notice<00:01:37.990> on<00:01:38.259> the<00:01:38.320> back<00:01:38.530> of<00:01:38.710> the<00:01:38.770> case
