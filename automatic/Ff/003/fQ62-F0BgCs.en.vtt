thought<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.090> peaked<00:01:54.420> four<00:01:54.929> or<00:01:55.020> five<00:01:55.200> years<00:01:55.560> ago

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
but in the last couple of years I've

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.219 
but in the last couple of years I've
seen<00:02:01.130> that<00:02:02.130> tenfold<00:02:02.429> increase<00:02:03.090> at<00:02:03.329> least<00:02:03.779> I

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229
