00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
making sure all your pieces are 90

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.560 
making sure all your pieces are 90
degrees<00:02:22.260> to<00:02:22.620> each<00:02:22.650> other<00:02:23.150> if<00:02:24.150> it's<00:02:24.360> off<00:02:24.540> a

degrees to each other if it's off a
little<00:02:24.840> bit<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.920> things<00:02:26.250> that<00:02:26.490> are<00:02:26.610> going<00:02:26.730> to

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
little bit the things that are going to

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.640 
little bit the things that are going to
end<00:02:27.270> up<00:02:27.360> falling<00:02:27.570> out<00:02:27.810> of<00:02:27.840> place<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.440> more

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
end up falling out of place and the more

end up falling out of place and the more
you<00:02:28.740> get<00:02:28.890> out<00:02:28.950> of<00:02:29.190> out<00:02:29.490> of<00:02:30.470> alignment<00:02:31.470> the

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
you get out of out of alignment the

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.590 
you get out of out of alignment the
worse<00:02:32.520> it's<00:02:33.240> gonna<00:02:33.480> be<00:02:33.750> for<00:02:34.020> you<00:02:35.030> of<00:02:36.030> course

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
we want to put a bin right there

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:36.130 
we want to put a bin right there

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.229 

all<00:03:50.620> right<00:03:50.739> all<00:03:50.950> the<00:03:51.069> steel<00:03:51.340> most<00:03:52.060> of<00:03:52.150> the

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
all right all the steel most of the

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:57.420 
all right all the steel most of the
bodywork<00:03:55.470> pieces<00:03:56.470> that<00:03:56.620> I<00:03:56.680> bought<00:03:56.920> was<00:03:57.220> all

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
bodywork pieces that I bought was all

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.880 
bodywork pieces that I bought was all
from<00:03:57.760> Home<00:03:58.000> Depot<00:03:58.200> this<00:03:59.200> is<00:03:59.380> just<00:03:59.650> regular

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
from Home Depot this is just regular

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:06.449 
from Home Depot this is just regular
sheet<00:04:00.430> steel<00:04:03.959> what<00:04:04.959> is<00:04:05.110> this<00:04:05.290> this<00:04:05.470> is<00:04:05.680> a<00:04:05.709> 24<00:04:06.310> by

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
sheet steel what is this this is a 24 by

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.190 
sheet steel what is this this is a 24 by
24<00:04:06.519> inch<00:04:07.360> sheet<00:04:08.170> and<00:04:08.860> I<00:04:09.040> think<00:04:09.340> it's<00:04:09.550> like

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
24 inch sheet and I think it's like

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:17.060 
24 inch sheet and I think it's like
thicknesses<00:04:12.900> product<00:04:14.220> 1/32<00:04:15.220> or<00:04:15.489> maybe<00:04:16.120> 1/16

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
thicknesses product 1/32 or maybe 1/16

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.780 
thicknesses product 1/32 or maybe 1/16
doesn't<00:04:18.070> need<00:04:18.190> be<00:04:18.310> too<00:04:18.810> too<00:04:19.810> thick<00:04:20.579> it's<00:04:21.579> just

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
doesn't need be too too thick it's just

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:29.040 
doesn't need be too too thick it's just
for<00:04:22.000> bodywork<00:04:22.510> so<00:04:26.850> this<00:04:27.850> material<00:04:28.150> here<00:04:28.510> is<00:04:28.660> a

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
for bodywork so this material here is a

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.320 
for bodywork so this material here is a
gutter<00:04:29.440> material<00:04:29.979> you<00:04:30.430> may<00:04:30.580> recognize<00:04:31.060> it<00:04:31.240> on

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
gutter material you may recognize it on

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:37.379 
gutter material you may recognize it on
the<00:04:31.479> dozer<00:04:31.690> for<00:04:32.169> the<00:04:32.830> grille<00:04:33.070> here<00:04:35.460> I<00:04:36.460> bought<00:04:37.330> a

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389

1824 inches you're gonna need a quite a

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:52.920 
1824 inches you're gonna need a quite a
few<00:04:51.160> of<00:04:51.280> these<00:04:51.430> I<00:04:51.790> can't<00:04:52.180> tell<00:04:52.479> you<00:04:52.600> how<00:04:52.750> many

where I built it was piece by piece I
went<00:05:02.350> and<00:05:02.410> bought<00:05:02.620> it<00:05:02.830> as<00:05:03.010> I<00:05:03.490> needed<00:05:03.880> it<00:05:04.030> so<00:05:04.840> I'd

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
went and bought it as I needed it so I'd

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.659 
went and bought it as I needed it so I'd

get a couple sticks here couple sticks

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:16.299 
get a couple sticks here couple sticks
there<00:05:06.880> to<00:05:07.090> build<00:05:07.330> it

00:05:16.299 --> 00:05:16.309 

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:20.229 

I<00:05:16.339> also<00:05:17.029> bought<00:05:17.329> some<00:05:17.799> loli<00:05:18.799> I<00:05:19.099> guess<00:05:20.029> you'd

I also bought some loli I guess you'd

00:05:20.239 --> 00:05:24.969 
I also bought some loli I guess you'd
call<00:05:20.299> it<00:05:20.509> an<00:05:20.719> l-shape<00:05:21.349> 90-degree<00:05:23.319> and<00:05:24.319> this

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:24.979 
call it an l-shape 90-degree and this

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:28.529 
call it an l-shape 90-degree and this
comes<00:05:25.219> in<00:05:26.589> different<00:05:27.589> lengths<00:05:28.009> as<00:05:28.219> well

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:28.539 
comes in different lengths as well

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:30.909 
comes in different lengths as well
Shh<00:05:29.539> you're<00:05:29.989> gonna<00:05:30.079> cut<00:05:30.319> a<00:05:30.349> bunch<00:05:30.439> of<00:05:30.769> these

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 
Shh you're gonna cut a bunch of these

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:33.249 
Shh you're gonna cut a bunch of these
little<00:05:31.369> pieces<00:05:31.639> here<00:05:32.059> this<00:05:32.239> is<00:05:32.419> how<00:05:32.689> I<00:05:32.719> attach

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:33.259 
little pieces here this is how I attach

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:38.289 
little pieces here this is how I attach
my<00:05:33.499> track<00:05:33.799> to<00:05:34.839> to<00:05:35.839> the<00:05:35.959> track<00:05:36.259> pads<00:05:36.559> and<00:05:37.489> these

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:38.299 
my track to to the track pads and these

00:05:38.299 --> 00:05:43.539 
my track to to the track pads and these
pieces<00:05:38.539> here<00:05:38.929> this<00:05:39.589> was<00:05:39.769> flat<00:05:40.069> bar<00:05:40.339> and<00:05:42.549> it

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:43.549 
pieces here this was flat bar and it

00:05:43.549 --> 00:05:46.149 
pieces here this was flat bar and it
came<00:05:43.759> in<00:05:44.169> different<00:05:45.169> various<00:05:45.679> links<00:05:45.919> as<00:05:46.129> well

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:46.159 
came in different various links as well

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:48.399 
came in different various links as well
it's<00:05:46.969> a<00:05:47.029> little<00:05:47.149> bit<00:05:47.329> thicker<00:05:47.569> I<00:05:47.899> think<00:05:48.259> it's

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:48.409 
it's a little bit thicker I think it's

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:51.519 
it's a little bit thicker I think it's
probably<00:05:48.649> you<00:05:49.489> know<00:05:50.169> what<00:05:51.169> was<00:05:51.289> that<00:05:51.439> about

00:05:51.519 --> 00:05:51.529 
probably you know what was that about

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:52.749 
probably you know what was that about
eighth<00:05:51.829> inch<00:05:52.099> thick

eighth inch thick

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:58.359 
eighth inch thick
it's<00:05:53.059> about<00:05:53.799> inch<00:05:54.799> and<00:05:55.099> a<00:05:55.189> quarter<00:05:55.610> I<00:05:57.369> think

00:05:58.359 --> 00:05:58.369 
it's about inch and a quarter I think

00:05:58.369 --> 00:05:59.799 
it's about inch and a quarter I think
yeah<00:05:58.579> about<00:05:58.789> an<00:05:58.969> inch<00:05:59.089> and<00:05:59.239> a<00:05:59.269> quarter<00:05:59.479> wide

00:05:59.799 --> 00:05:59.809 
yeah about an inch and a quarter wide

00:05:59.809 --> 00:06:03.489 
yeah about an inch and a quarter wide
the<00:06:00.439> actual<00:06:00.829> pad<00:06:01.399> itself<00:06:01.819> is<00:06:02.209> one<00:06:02.989> inch<00:06:03.199> and

00:06:03.489 --> 00:06:03.499 
the actual pad itself is one inch and

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:07.449 
the actual pad itself is one inch and
the<00:06:04.429> upper<00:06:04.759> portion<00:06:06.219> there's<00:06:07.219> about<00:06:07.399> a

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:07.459 
the upper portion there's about a

00:06:07.459 --> 00:06:15.309 
the upper portion there's about a
quarter<00:06:07.789> inch<00:06:13.419> one<00:06:14.419> of<00:06:14.479> the<00:06:14.569> other<00:06:14.719> most

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:15.319 
quarter inch one of the other most

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:17.349

important<00:06:15.799> things<00:06:15.979> when<00:06:16.129> you<00:06:16.249> do<00:06:16.369> this<00:06:16.549> is<00:06:16.789> to

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:17.359 
important things when you do this is to

00:06:17.359 --> 00:06:20.579 
important things when you do this is to
have<00:06:17.599> something<00:06:18.529> to<00:06:18.679> reference<00:06:18.889> off<00:06:19.309> of<00:06:19.609> I

00:06:20.579 --> 00:06:20.589 
have something to reference off of I

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:23.199 
have something to reference off of I
shouldn't<00:06:21.589> buy<00:06:21.709> one<00:06:22.309> of<00:06:22.339> these<00:06:22.519> just<00:06:22.849> as<00:06:23.179> a

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:23.209 
shouldn't buy one of these just as a

00:06:23.209 --> 00:06:25.899 
shouldn't buy one of these just as a
plastic<00:06:23.749> this<00:06:23.959> it's<00:06:24.679> cheaper<00:06:25.159> the<00:06:25.519> rubber

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:25.909 
plastic this it's cheaper the rubber

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:27.729 
plastic this it's cheaper the rubber
tracks<00:06:26.239> already<00:06:26.509> melted<00:06:26.959> off<00:06:27.079> the<00:06:27.289> damn<00:06:27.439> thing

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:27.739 
tracks already melted off the damn thing

00:06:27.739 --> 00:06:31.839 
tracks already melted off the damn thing
but<00:06:29.319> basically<00:06:30.319> you<00:06:31.039> know<00:06:31.129> you<00:06:31.189> look<00:06:31.489> at<00:06:31.669> that

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:31.849 
but basically you know you look at that

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:35.379 
but basically you know you look at that
and<00:06:32.089> try<00:06:32.360> to<00:06:32.389> figure<00:06:32.689> it<00:06:33.019> out<00:06:33.249> okay<00:06:34.249> how<00:06:34.489> how<00:06:35.329> do

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:35.389 
and try to figure it out okay how how do

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:39.100 
and try to figure it out okay how how do
I<00:06:35.539> want<00:06:35.809> mine<00:06:35.989> to<00:06:36.079> look<00:06:36.289> so<00:06:37.959> you<00:06:38.959> know<00:06:39.049> you

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:43.269 
I want mine to look so you know you
could<00:06:39.409> reference<00:06:40.369> pieces<00:06:41.439> so<00:06:42.439> a<00:06:42.499> couple<00:06:42.799> hours

00:06:43.269 --> 00:06:43.279 
could reference pieces so a couple hours

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:49.299 
could reference pieces so a couple hours
later<00:06:43.459> I<00:06:43.879> got<00:06:44.239> it<00:06:44.389> all<00:06:44.509> broke<00:06:44.779> down<00:06:46.209> and<00:06:48.309> talk

00:06:49.299 --> 00:06:49.309 
later I got it all broke down and talk

00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:52.569 
later I got it all broke down and talk
