your<00:00:10.710> team<00:00:10.920> oh<00:00:11.300> very<00:00:12.300> young<00:00:13.040> but<00:00:14.040> I<00:00:14.099> think<00:00:14.250> we

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
your team oh very young but I think we

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.279 
your team oh very young but I think we
have<00:00:14.340> a<00:00:14.460> lot<00:00:14.580> of<00:00:14.610> talent<00:00:15.030> that<00:00:15.260> hasn't<00:00:16.260> been

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
have a lot of talent that hasn't been

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.840 
have a lot of talent that hasn't been
proven<00:00:16.529> yet<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.890> Big<00:00:17.039> Ten<00:00:17.220> I<00:00:17.400> think<00:00:17.580> we<00:00:17.640> use<00:00:17.760> it

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
proven yet the Big Ten I think we use it

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.109 
proven yet the Big Ten I think we use it
to<00:00:17.880> our<00:00:18.000> advantage<00:00:18.060> I<00:00:18.449> think<00:00:19.340> we<00:00:20.340> often<00:00:20.820> sigh

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
to our advantage I think we often sigh

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.810 
to our advantage I think we often sigh
think<00:00:21.300> I'd<00:00:21.390> be<00:00:21.510> used<00:00:22.070> effectively<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.580> sense

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
think I'd be used effectively the sense

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.910 
think I'd be used effectively the sense
that<00:00:23.880> you<00:00:24.029> will<00:00:24.300> have<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.449> lot<00:00:24.689> of<00:00:24.800> three<00:00:25.800> or

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
that you will have a lot of three or

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.130 
that you will have a lot of three or
four<00:00:26.099> maybe<00:00:26.369> double-digit<00:00:27.119> scorers<00:00:27.359> I<00:00:27.599> think

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
four maybe double-digit scorers I think

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.439 
four maybe double-digit scorers I think
we<00:00:28.199> can<00:00:28.320> really<00:00:28.410> just<00:00:28.590> showed<00:00:28.800> you<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.039> points

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449
