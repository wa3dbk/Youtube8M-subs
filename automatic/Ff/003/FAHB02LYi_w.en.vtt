00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
off it's going to be comfortable and

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.060 
off it's going to be comfortable and
once<00:02:03.960> it's<00:02:04.140> big<00:02:04.320> enough<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.560> get<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.860> next

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
once it's big enough to get the next

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.850 
once it's big enough to get the next
size<00:02:05.280> up<00:02:05.310> you<00:02:05.909> have<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.210> go<00:02:06.450> get<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:07.170> next<00:02:07.740> size

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
size up you have to go get the next size

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.910 
size up you have to go get the next size
plugs<00:02:08.250> because<00:02:09.000> if<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.209> don't<00:02:09.390> then<00:02:10.140> no<00:02:10.470> fall

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
plugs because if you don't then no fall

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.080 
plugs because if you don't then no fall
out<00:02:11.069> of<00:02:11.099> your<00:02:11.250> ear<00:02:11.430> when<00:02:11.550> you're<00:02:11.670> sleeping

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
out of your ear when you're sleeping

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.300 
out of your ear when you're sleeping
because<00:02:12.629> there's<00:02:12.900> so<00:02:13.020> much<00:02:13.110> space

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
because there's so much space

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.309 
because there's so much space
it's<00:02:15.310> gonna<00:02:15.489> pull<00:02:15.700> it<00:02:15.879> and<00:02:16.629> that's<00:02:16.989> not<00:02:17.080> good

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
it's gonna pull it and that's not good

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:18.780 
it's gonna pull it and that's not good
because<00:02:17.620> it<00:02:17.860> falls<00:02:18.069> out<00:02:18.310> then<00:02:18.580> it<00:02:18.670> could

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
because it falls out then it could

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.100 
because it falls out then it could
downsize<00:02:19.000> and<00:02:19.599> that<00:02:19.690> takes<00:02:20.019> a<00:02:21.060> lot<00:02:22.060> of<00:02:22.390> pulling

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
downsize and that takes a lot of pulling

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.270 
downsize and that takes a lot of pulling
on<00:02:23.260> your<00:02:23.379> ears<00:02:23.650> away<00:02:24.599> it<00:02:25.599> just<00:02:25.810> makes<00:02:26.049> all<00:02:26.920> that

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
on your ears away it just makes all that

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.360 
on your ears away it just makes all that
work<00:02:27.430> they<00:02:27.459> just<00:02:27.610> did<00:02:28.349> go<00:02:29.349> down<00:02:29.379> the<00:02:29.620> drain<00:02:29.830> so

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
work they just did go down the drain so

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.170 
work they just did go down the drain so
you<00:02:30.459> don't<00:02:30.610> want<00:02:30.730> to<00:02:30.790> do<00:02:30.849> that

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
you don't want to do that

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.259 
you don't want to do that
that<00:02:31.720> looks<00:02:32.260> suck<00:02:32.470> um<00:02:33.250> so<00:02:34.060> then<00:02:34.180> you

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
that looks suck um so then you
