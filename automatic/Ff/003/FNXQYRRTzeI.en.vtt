00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:17.870
 in this lesson we will figure out how to do 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.870
 overlapping with 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.200
 geometric forms are simple therefore we 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:28.040
 first you need to figure out how 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.720
 what model we did well in kerch from 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.060
 collections we have already seen that our pendulum 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.450
 consists of 3 parts to give them draw 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:39.309
 for this, I took a pencil in the window 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:42.650
 viewport and now clicked the plus sign in 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.540
 the pencil menu and now I got 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.010
 here is a cell that says 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.220
 because I can draw already in the window 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:53.110
 so choosing a pencil and let's say there 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.110
 any color many are now green 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:58.880
 let 's see our making 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.770
 consist of three parts the first part 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.309
 will take impulse and all the rest 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.880
 parts will already be moving in 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.250
 overlap 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:10.790
 was the first part of our this will be the club 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.920
 yes and then there will be our cylinder we break 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.630
 make a ball to feel the joint and 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:19.869
 attach another one to it 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.340
 copy another joint to 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.440
 see how it works on all these 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.899
 interactions among themselves we will 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.550
 move our main part to the right and 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.840
 return left with stop and 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:35.630
 let's see how our pendulum works 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:39.740
 reeling in sequence 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:42.860
 one after another draw the complete pattern i 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.369
 now I will not we just see it already 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.920
 in the animation how it works because in 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:50.090
 May you can do it all the more technically. 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.740
 we don't have to draw every 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:56.420
 layout insert key in each frame 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:58.850
 so i close the menu first i will erase 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:03.520
 we rather just close and delete this 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.520
 I do not need a key now, let's 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:11.470
 make geometric forms of which 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.849
 we will create our pendulum is a cube 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:18.470
 which we will now stretch a little 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:19.800
 that form which we need I will 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.100
 use 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.650
 r key that is, turn on the scale 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:28.560
 translate w raise 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.990
 push us to show the desired part 1 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.540
 height enable 5 to display 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.900
 it is better 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:39.590
 geometry and create further cylinder 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.710
 the cylinder I'm in the window 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.060
 the right impetus to change his radius deal 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.360
 a little bit smaller because we don’t 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.970
 need so thick so thick barrel 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.370
 raising very much higher let's get it 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.210
 let's do a little bit longer 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.310
 such a radius can be done more 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.320
 you can hammer hands for example to put 0 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.370
 3 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:08.370
 so internally let's put 02 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.010
 fine . I already have 4 bandages 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.350
 and what is most interesting we need 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.820
 shift here our pivot for which we 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:19.920
 move and twist our pendulum in 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.720
 top to pendulum 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.430
 it was possible to download from the root part alone 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.080
 from central for this i click 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:31.530
 enter button and you see my 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:33.410
 manipulator turned into such a different 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.790
 manipulator which is already without arrows 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:39.300
 i need to move it up but 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.670
 see if I will do it with my hands 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.860
 moving it by the stripes I can't 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.970
 exactly get exactly the most 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:50.390
 center so i press a button in and 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:54.209
 middle mouse button 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.550
 like dreams plus points of vertices 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.860
 which is on the surface 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:01.080
 geometry as i got drunk to the center i 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.350
 I can already press the enter button again and you 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.730
 see that my 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:10.290
 the manipulator is now exactly there 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:12.220
 where I need further I do the recess 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:18.830
 of my 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:21.890
 manipulator in the inside of the cube in order 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:22.400
 just to visually have to 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:26.170
 to myself 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:31.130
 there will be such a complex form that 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:33.050
 is a pendulum further to 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:36.200
 I need to do the second part 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.850
 press the button in control-d and copy 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:42.710
 the diameter that I already did 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:45.950
 then I press w and shift my my second 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:48.260
 mighty who appeared in my second 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.300
 cylinder who appeared inside first 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:55.670
 cylinder also click in 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:57.920
 from no it to the center you can even push 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.140
 button 4 to see transparency 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.670
 geometry 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:05.720
 pressing the ps button on drink it to the very 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:07.700
 the center of the first cylinder and so here I have 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.470
 It turned out already here T-shirts which we 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.840
 drew started but we need more 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:15.020
 put here reconciliation 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:18.410
 and to see the joints it is more 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:23.000
 clearly shows us how the curve works 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:26.210
 and so i created a sphere using the r button 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.580
 or scale just and and reduce and make 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.060
 same button keying 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.919
 at 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:36.520
 and the center of the sphere I have with on the pizza to the center 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:40.580
 joint, I also duplicate his control-d 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:42.890
 if its to the very bottom of the joint 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.830
 see from all sides press the button 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:48.220
 5 and here we see we can even lower and 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:52.340
 step to do a little bit more tambov 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:54.470
 see it a little bit smaller here with us 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.600
 roughly speaking there are already forms that we 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:59.060
 can watch 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.860
 but she see still not working we need 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.140
 connect all the parts together to 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:06.169
 they worked in succession with us 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:08.910
 as if a direct relationship and where on 1 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:12.390
 part depends on the other therefore 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:15.960
 before their fellow guy network 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:17.340
 that is, we will make the legs first 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.260
 five prize transformation 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.240
 reset all values ​​you see now u 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.650
 we are all zero by 100 scale only 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.860
 the only ones left are this 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:28.610
 ok now we allocate our part 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:31.110
 which we want hi parenti 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:33.690
 parent part we give parent 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:37.590
 part we press the button n and we observe that 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:39.720
 now we have when moving the top 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:44.610
 parts move and the second part 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:47.100
 dependently and also we are made with a ball with 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:48.480
 bottom but already grateful and or 

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:51.720
 to the ball or to the upper cylinder without 

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:57.690
 the difference let's see the ball like 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:07:00.420
 us works so works 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:03.180
 ok now the last part is pushing 

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:05.670
 n all our pendulum is ready we can 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:08.010
 move pro coals do it with him 

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:14.060
 the animation died ping in all 

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:14.060
 directions and we are happy
