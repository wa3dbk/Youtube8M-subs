can build that you could just put

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.530 
can build that you could just put
somewhere<00:00:38.250> even<00:00:38.430> if<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.700> just<00:00:38.879> wanna<00:00:39.030> have<00:00:39.510> a

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
slab there yeah that's where like a dude

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.290 
slab there yeah that's where like a dude
will<00:00:45.750> be<00:00:45.870> standing<00:00:46.110> there<00:00:46.469> gonna<00:00:47.010> do<00:00:47.129> this

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
will be standing there gonna do this

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.319 
will be standing there gonna do this
l-shape<00:00:48.350> sort<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.469> design<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.370> it's<00:00:51.180> gonna<00:00:51.270> be

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
l-shape sort of design and it's gonna be

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.880 
l-shape sort of design and it's gonna be
the<00:00:51.449> green<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.050> then<00:00:52.410> you're<00:00:52.530> gonna<00:00:52.590> do<00:00:52.770> this

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
the green and then you're gonna do this

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.400 
the green and then you're gonna do this
back<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.309> forth<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:54.059> know<00:00:54.090> pattern<00:00:54.780> with<00:00:55.379> the

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
back and forth you know pattern with the

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.740 
back and forth you know pattern with the
red<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.309> black<00:00:56.460> wool<00:00:56.730> which<00:00:57.420> are<00:00:57.539> gonna<00:00:57.629> be

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
red and black wool which are gonna be

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.180 
red and black wool which are gonna be
like<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.989> tiles<00:00:58.440> whatever<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:58.829> want<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.039> say

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
like the tiles whatever you want to say

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.590 
like the tiles whatever you want to say
and<00:00:59.340> then<00:00:59.789> you're<00:01:00.090> gonna<00:01:00.180> make<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.420> wheel

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
and then you're gonna make the wheel

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.020 
and then you're gonna make the wheel
using<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.260> rails<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.460> it's<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.699> pretty<00:01:02.850> simple

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
using a rails and it's a pretty simple

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.640 
using a rails and it's a pretty simple
build<00:01:03.359> on<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.629> so<00:01:03.719> it's<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.930> very<00:01:03.960> simple<00:01:04.350> build

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
build on it so it's a very simple build

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.719 
build on it so it's a very simple build
I<00:01:04.739> don't<00:01:04.860> really<00:01:05.010> call<00:01:05.280> in<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.400> whole<00:01:05.549> lot<00:01:05.700> of

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
I don't really call in a whole lot of

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.609 
I don't really call in a whole lot of
detail<00:01:06.060> then<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:06.600> guess<00:01:06.750> how<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:06.930> do<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.200> but

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
detail then I guess how to do it but

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.380 
detail then I guess how to do it but
overall<00:01:07.950> it's<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.220> very<00:01:08.250> cool<00:01:08.580> build<00:01:08.909> like<00:01:09.240> I

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
overall it's a very cool build like I

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.670 
overall it's a very cool build like I
said<00:01:09.600> like<00:01:09.630> if<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:09.960> want<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.200> put<00:01:10.350> this<00:01:10.470> like

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
said like if you want to put this like

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.260 
said like if you want to put this like
say<00:01:10.799> if<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:10.920> had<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.070> house<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.580> get<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.030> pool

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
say if you had a house and get a pool

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.700 
say if you had a house and get a pool
table<00:01:12.330> or<00:01:12.720> like<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:12.930> guess<00:01:13.080> like<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.260> game<00:01:13.470> room

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
table or like I guess like a game room

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.109 
table or like I guess like a game room
you<00:01:13.799> could<00:01:13.920> put<00:01:14.070> this<00:01:14.189> in<00:01:14.430> there<00:01:14.549> or<00:01:14.850> if<00:01:15.060> you

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
you could put this in there or if you

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.640 
you could put this in there or if you

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
like this in there you know overall it's

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.990 
like this in there you know overall it's
cool<00:01:18.240> it's<00:01:18.420> simple<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:18.900> uh<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.229> like<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.799> very

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
simple I'm actually working on our let

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.880 
simple I'm actually working on our let
table<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:24.960> could<00:01:25.170> actually<00:01:25.290> play<00:01:25.710> as<00:01:25.860> a

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
table that you could actually play as a

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.039 
table that you could actually play as a
game<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.939> hopefully<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.330> guys<00:01:27.420> could<00:01:27.689> end<00:01:27.930> up

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
game so hopefully you guys could end up

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.020 
game so hopefully you guys could end up
seeing<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.409> in<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.590> future<00:01:28.710> but<00:01:29.579> uh<00:01:29.640> yeah<00:01:30.000> I

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030

seeing that in the future but uh yeah I
think<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.780> for<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.960> video<00:01:31.049> though<00:01:31.290> I

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
think that is it for the video though I

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.780 
think that is it for the video though I
hope<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.650> guys<00:01:31.799> did<00:01:32.040> like<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.220> because<00:01:32.549> I
