00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.950 
devastating in this game and it's oh
right<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.520> haven't<00:01:47.880> found<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.240> gun<00:01:48.420> in<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:48.659> game

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
right I haven't found a gun in this game

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.679 
right I haven't found a gun in this game
that<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.439> can<00:01:49.710> say<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.220> absolute<00:01:50.790> literal<00:01:51.270> Trish

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
that I can say is absolute literal Trish

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.319 
that I can say is absolute literal Trish
now<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.290> reason<00:01:52.560> why<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:52.920> stress<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.579> word<00:01:53.610> gun

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
now the reason why I stress the word gun

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.990 
now the reason why I stress the word gun
is<00:01:54.600> because<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.799> Baba<00:01:56.040> deer<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.490> not<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.700> gun

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
is because the Baba deer is not a gun

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.780 
is because the Baba deer is not a gun
it's<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.659> slingshot<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:58.860> shoots<00:01:59.250> like<00:01:59.610> the

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
it's a slingshot and it shoots like the

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.520 
it's a slingshot and it shoots like the
shittiest<00:02:00.270> ammo<00:02:00.630> you've<00:02:00.810> ever<00:02:00.990> seen<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.290> don't

the<00:03:11.670> desperado<00:03:12.299> a<00:03:12.599> lot<00:03:13.110> of<00:03:13.260> people<00:03:13.530> have<00:03:13.620> a

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
the desperado a lot of people have a

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.890 
the desperado a lot of people have a
problem<00:03:13.920> with<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.310> desperado<00:03:14.940> I<00:03:15.239> won't<00:03:15.660> seem

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
problem with the desperado I won't seem

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.479

to<00:03:16.019> have<00:03:16.170> a<00:03:16.200> problem<00:03:16.440> with<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.739> desperado<00:03:17.220> I

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
to have a problem with the desperado I

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.370 
to have a problem with the desperado I
actually<00:03:17.790> think<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.389> hit<00:03:18.540> detection<00:03:18.660> on<00:03:19.170> the

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
actually think the hit detection on the

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.410 
actually think the hit detection on the
desperado<00:03:19.950> is<00:03:20.160> a<00:03:20.220> little<00:03:20.790> bit<00:03:20.910> better<00:03:21.090> the

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
desperado is a little bit better the

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.330 
desperado is a little bit better the
fire<00:03:21.690> rate<00:03:22.049> makes<00:03:22.380> up<00:03:22.620> for<00:03:22.829> the<00:03:22.859> fact<00:03:22.950> that

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
fire rate makes up for the fact that

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.280 
fire rate makes up for the fact that
it's<00:03:23.700> just<00:03:23.790> a<00:03:24.060> little<00:03:24.359> bit<00:03:24.690> weaker<00:03:25.109> than<00:03:25.260> a

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
it's just a little bit weaker than a

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.229 
it's just a little bit weaker than a
gatekeeper<00:03:26.010> and<00:03:26.130> that<00:03:26.609> could<00:03:26.760> be<00:03:26.790> negated

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
gatekeeper and that could be negated

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.300 
gatekeeper and that could be negated
with<00:03:27.540> a<00:03:27.569> perk<00:03:27.930> called<00:03:28.350> a<00:03:28.470> marksman<00:03:29.069> if<00:03:29.220> you

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310
