00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
going to be taking a look at the magma

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.570 
going to be taking a look at the magma
crucible<00:00:11.910> from<00:00:12.090> thermal<00:00:12.420> expansion<00:00:13.580> the

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
crucible from thermal expansion the

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.919 
crucible from thermal expansion the
interface<00:00:14.969> of<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.179> magma<00:00:15.389> crucible<00:00:15.839> is

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
interface of the magma crucible is

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:16.609 
interface of the magma crucible is
rather<00:00:16.049> simple

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
rather simple

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.910 
rather simple
over<00:00:17.160> here<00:00:17.400> is<00:00:17.550> your<00:00:17.730> energy<00:00:18.090> storage<00:00:18.420> bar

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920

this is the progress of the item that's

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.750 
this is the progress of the item that's
getting<00:00:24.269> melted<00:00:24.660> down<00:00:24.840> into<00:00:25.500> liquid<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.130> then

here is your internal storage it holds

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.550 
here is your internal storage it holds
10<00:00:28.980> buckets<00:00:29.929> since<00:00:30.929> this<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.230> thermal

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
10 buckets since this is a thermal

10 buckets since this is a thermal
expansion<00:00:32.040> machine<00:00:32.399> it's<00:00:32.759> got<00:00:32.940> an<00:00:33.030> easily

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
expansion machine it's got an easily

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.959 
expansion machine it's got an easily
configurable<00:00:33.960> configuration<00:00:34.920> so<00:00:35.399> automating

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
configurable configuration so automating

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.850 
configurable configuration so automating
this<00:00:36.090> machine<00:00:36.420> is<00:00:36.540> rather<00:00:36.719> simple<00:00:37.079> if<00:00:37.559> we<00:00:37.620> go

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
this machine is rather simple if we go

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.319 
this machine is rather simple if we go
ahead<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.070> take<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.280> look<00:00:38.460> at<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.640> recipe<00:00:39.000> it

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
ahead and take a look at the recipe it

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.540 
ahead and take a look at the recipe it
is<00:00:40.079> 2<00:00:40.350> copper<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:41.239> redstone<00:00:42.239> reception<00:00:42.899> coil<00:00:43.140> a

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
is 2 copper a redstone reception coil a

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.240 
is 2 copper a redstone reception coil a
machine<00:00:44.550> frame<00:00:44.850> 2<00:00:45.809> nether<00:00:46.110> brick<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.649> a

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
machine frame 2 nether brick and a

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.790 
machine frame 2 nether brick and a
bucket<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.850> that's<00:00:48.450> for<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.870> magma<00:00:49.260> crucible

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
bucket and that's for the magma crucible

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.709 
bucket and that's for the magma crucible
powering<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.850> magma<00:00:51.120> crucible<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.570> rather

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
powering the magma crucible is rather

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.410 
powering the magma crucible is rather
easy<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.199> takes<00:00:52.500> MJ<00:00:52.829> power<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.760> for<00:00:53.969> example<00:00:54.329> I

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
easy it takes MJ power so for example I

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.869 
easy it takes MJ power so for example I
just<00:00:54.449> have<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:55.050> hybrid<00:00:55.469> solar<00:00:55.829> panel<00:00:56.190> with<00:00:56.730> an

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
just have a hybrid solar panel with an

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.400 
just have a hybrid solar panel with an
electrical<00:00:57.329> engine<00:00:57.629> going<00:00:57.960> into<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.230> magma

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
electrical engine going into the magma

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.830 
electrical engine going into the magma
crucible<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.190> now<00:00:59.730> this<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.059> rather<00:01:00.210> slow<00:01:00.570> the

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
crucible and now this is rather slow the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.689 
crucible and now this is rather slow the
magma<00:01:01.170> crucible<00:01:01.649> can<00:01:01.829> take<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.010> lot<00:01:02.309> more<00:01:02.489> power

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
magma crucible can take a lot more power

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.939 
magma crucible can take a lot more power
than<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:02.910> thing's<00:01:03.239> putting<00:01:03.480> out<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:04.650> if<00:01:04.830> we

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
than that thing's putting out so if we

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.920 
than that thing's putting out so if we
come<00:01:05.100> over<00:01:05.129> here<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:06.210> can<00:01:06.360> see<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:06.689> have<00:01:06.900> a

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
come over here you can see that I have a

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.810 
come over here you can see that I have a
magnetic<00:01:07.380> engine<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.040> this<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:08.670> will

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
magnetic engine and this is this will

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.969 
magnetic engine and this is this will
actually<00:01:09.060> with<00:01:09.360> Stane<00:01:09.630> itself<00:01:10.080> so<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.890> it

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
actually with Stane itself so that it

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.500 
actually with Stane itself so that it
will<00:01:11.040> keep<00:01:11.220> supplying<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.760> with<00:01:11.850> lava<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.360> it

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
will keep supplying it with lava and it

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.390 
will keep supplying it with lava and it
will<00:01:12.600> come<00:01:12.750> around<00:01:12.990> come<00:01:13.680> back<00:01:13.740> up<00:01:14.010> here<00:01:14.250> and

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
will come around come back up here and

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.609 
will come around come back up here and
empower<00:01:14.820> this<00:01:15.060> geothermal<00:01:15.420> generator<00:01:15.750> which

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
empower this geothermal generator which

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.370 
empower this geothermal generator which
is<00:01:16.680> powering<00:01:17.220> this<00:01:17.340> mfsu<00:01:18.170> automating<00:01:19.170> the

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
is powering this mfsu automating the

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.510 
is powering this mfsu automating the
magma<00:01:19.710> crucible<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.159> rather<00:01:20.280> easy

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
magma crucible is rather easy

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.219 
magma crucible is rather easy
considering<00:01:21.240> its<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.450> thermal<00:01:21.780> expansion

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
considering its a thermal expansion

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.960 
considering its a thermal expansion
machine<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.770> we<00:01:23.220> can<00:01:23.369> adjust<00:01:23.490> where

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
machine and we can adjust where

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.660 
machine and we can adjust where
everything<00:01:24.450> goes<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:25.500> with<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.310> default

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
everything goes so with the default

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.249 
everything goes so with the default
configuration<00:01:27.420> you're<00:01:27.810> going<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:27.990> throw<00:01:28.170> your

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
configuration you're going to throw your

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.289 
configuration you're going to throw your
input<00:01:28.619> over<00:01:28.829> here<00:01:29.070> for<00:01:29.790> example<00:01:30.090> we're<00:01:30.180> going

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
input over here for example we're going

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.030 
input over here for example we're going
to<00:01:30.360> throw<00:01:30.509> another<00:01:30.689> rack<00:01:30.990> in<00:01:31.170> there<00:01:31.320> it's

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
to throw another rack in there it's

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.319 
to throw another rack in there it's
going<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.280> come<00:01:32.400> over<00:01:32.490> here<00:01:32.700> into<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.119> blue

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
going to come over here into the blue

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.819 
going to come over here into the blue
slot<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.869> it's<00:01:34.020> going<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.170> start<00:01:34.409> melting<00:01:34.770> it

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
slot and it's going to start melting it

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.429 
slot and it's going to start melting it
down<00:01:35.000> you<00:01:36.000> can<00:01:36.150> see<00:01:36.299> that<00:01:36.450> our<00:01:36.540> internal<00:01:36.930> power

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
down you can see that our internal power

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.710 
down you can see that our internal power
storage<00:01:37.950> is<00:01:38.100> full<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.579> just<00:01:39.390> have<00:01:39.509> some

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
storage is full I just have some

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.260 
storage is full I just have some
magmatic<00:01:40.020> engines<00:01:40.500> down<00:01:40.710> there<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.310> that's

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
magmatic engines down there and that's

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.700 
magmatic engines down there and that's
powering<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.079> then<00:01:43.229> we<00:01:43.320> can<00:01:43.470> see<00:01:43.590> the
