00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.029
 perhaps it was not the crisis of the 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.680
 juventus after the bewildering defeat 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.320
 from naples and with a brilliant finish 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.210
 replies against the Lazio a game that 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.950
 saw especially in the second half i 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.139
 bianconeri play smart 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.210
 give each other a hand in the 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.580
 difficult moments run across the board 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.510
 and counter the Lazio that was not 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.240
 certainly watching 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.490
 if in the Latium camp he gave himself 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.220
 a lot to do putting in trouble 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.539
 morini also king cecconi and nanni have 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.830
 worked well 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.390
 on the opposite side after having 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.920
 underlined the good collective proof 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.930
 of midfield and defense 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.540
 a particular note for Juventus 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.059
 altafini and bettega while causio nei 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.750
 Second 45 minutes was perhaps the 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.750
 best in the field 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.430
 the correct battle is immediately lively 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:57.140
 echo chinaglia advancing and pulling resumes 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.140

 32nd narrow bettega between three 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.110
 opponents try the wilson shoot 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:11.100
 replies the ball back to cuccureddu that 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.100
 centers the crossing of the poles 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.940
 at the 45th report lazio chinaglia serves 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.800
 nanni and runs to stand out surprisingly 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.630
 morini then on the cross of the median 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.930
 collects right very well by beating

 jo 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.810

 on the thrust of this goal the bianconeri 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:42.090
 find inspiration and momentum hair causio

 full 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.410
 and it is precisely on the spectacular vice of

 cause that a golden opportunity is created 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.630
 for longobucco the wrong conclusion 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.100
 but the goal is only postponed to

 seventeenth on the hair throwing 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.760
 Altafini goes on the right and centers off

 of bettega old-fashioned and juve 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.680
