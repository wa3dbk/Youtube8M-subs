glitch<00:01:29.470> to<00:01:29.709> do<00:01:29.860> and<00:01:30.130> I<00:01:30.459> did<00:01:30.520> upload<00:01:30.910> and<00:01:31.179> money

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
glitch to do and I did upload and money

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.120 
glitch to do and I did upload and money
glitch<00:01:31.599> a<00:01:31.690> couple<00:01:31.959> of<00:01:32.050> days<00:01:32.200> ago<00:01:32.380> you<00:01:32.860> only<00:01:32.979> get

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
glitch a couple of days ago you only get

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.070 
glitch a couple of days ago you only get
around<00:01:33.369> 1k<00:01:33.880> but<00:01:34.119> this<00:01:34.300> is<00:01:34.420> a<00:01:34.450> lot<00:01:34.720> better<00:01:34.869> I

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
around 1k but this is a lot better I

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.690 
around 1k but this is a lot better I
highly<00:01:35.440> suggest<00:01:35.619> you<00:01:35.830> do<00:01:36.009> this<00:01:36.220> because<00:01:36.399> it

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
highly suggest you do this because it

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.729 
highly suggest you do this because it
will<00:01:36.849> most<00:01:37.090> likely<00:01:37.360> to<00:01:37.630> get<00:01:37.750> patched<00:01:38.080> in<00:01:38.590> the

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:38.739 
will most likely to get patched in the

00:01:38.739 --> 00:01:40.499 
will most likely to get patched in the
