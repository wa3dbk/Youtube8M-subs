00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:16.209
 today from the Berlin fair we have 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.380
 approached the lenovo stand and how 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.630
 after checking is one of the 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.099
 more cheerful outdoor stands but not 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.500
 we come here to hang out we come to 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:25.570
 show you one of the best terminals 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.390
 of the graphic company of this case 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.070
 we talk about lenovo lives x2 is a 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.070
 terminal as you can check has a 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.600
 very nice design 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.760
 It is worth highlighting the first thing that is 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.170
 first phone that has a system of 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.090
 tapas we could call it has 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.989
 different ranges of colors besides 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:46.560
 different types is worth the body is 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:49.410
 made of aluminum 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.870
 lagarde notes that is that it has a good 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.300
 touch that is a terminal award and is a 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.490
 terminal that comes by specifications 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.960
 how can you check this phone 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.780
 works with a mediatek processor 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.070
 in this case it is the 6,595 model that 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.710
 it's nothing more and nothing less than 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.270
 oxidizing dawn of power and this is 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.550
 we add the 2 gigas of ram people in the 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.700
 phone we will see that the truth works 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:14.010
 like silk the internal memory is 32 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.770
 gigas although in principle I can not 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.240
 confirm but you could not expand another 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.010
 detail to keep in mind on your screen 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.750
 5 inch with full hd resolution 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.610
 here as we are outdoors and the 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.320
 front is a pretty bad day and 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.290
 well it looks very clear but the truth is 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.690
 that the excellent screen finally 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.310
 let's show the system version 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.310
 operative in this case 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.920
 in this case I feel sorry for the cure 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.990
 little bit more have already done as the axis 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.230
 between two manufacturers that has presented 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.690
 this model with version 4.4 painted 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:50.780
 anyway, you use your own 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:53.030
 interface muvisa rate highlight your camera 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.790
 and is that he again lives Egypt has 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.920
 a 3 - megapixel camera with flash 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.270
 led and makes some really good photos 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.470
 now let's do in the center to 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.420
 that you see 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.910
 you have to keep in mind that the terminal 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.990
 that we are driving are prototypes 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.490
 then it has some flaws 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.050
 sometimes it gets a little stuck 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.980
 obviously there is our version 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:16.180
 final we make a photo of capture 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.180
 very fast has automatic mode 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.830
 the hdr etcetera let's access here not 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:27.430
 was 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.430
 up here 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.000
 ok we have the photo you will see that the 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.830
 resolution 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.810
 it's pretty good they have not wanted 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.670
 confirm see this type of devices 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.670
 often use sound sensors by 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.360
 what quality is more than patents 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.360
 finally highlight 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.650
 its 5 megapixel front camera the 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.420
 Asian manufacturers have realized 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.940
 such is fashionable 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.650
 that is the end close half calls 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.989
 are beginning to give more megapixels to 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.610
 the front camera and finally highlight 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.470
 your battery that is one of the things that 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.239
 least we liked it more than anything because 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.660
 has a 2300 milliamp battery 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:10.050
 in my opinion a little bit fair even though we 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.700
 confirm and say that the processor is 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.390
 very well optimized and that's why 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.850
 can save 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.680
 and now I would play it on this good thing 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:21.700
 all forms today because they are 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:24.459
 confirmed from x2 will come out of this 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.860
 Asian and you'll get a bit of luck 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.510
 Southeast Europe has not been able to 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.370
 confirm if the rumors reach Spain 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.870
 They point out that if what we do know is that 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.250
 will have a very attractive price like 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.250
 are usually all the fruits of lenovo 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.930
 that will be between 250 and 300 euros in 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.520
 my case and Spain and look is a phone 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.080
 powerful and inexpensive that you know 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.070
 internet always me way to 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.070
 get acquainted
