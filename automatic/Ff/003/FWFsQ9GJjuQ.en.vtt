label<00:05:02.750> ear<00:05:03.580> inside<00:05:04.580> and<00:05:05.050> it<00:05:06.050> was<00:05:06.290> priced<00:05:06.680> at

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
label ear inside and it was priced at

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.970 
label ear inside and it was priced at
$10<00:05:08.150> which<00:05:08.360> I<00:05:08.450> can't<00:05:08.690> believe<00:05:08.960> it<00:05:09.140> was<00:05:09.290> $10<00:05:09.770> and

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
$10 which I can't believe it was $10 and

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.980 
$10 which I can't believe it was $10 and
then<00:05:10.100> because<00:05:10.310> it<00:05:10.370> was<00:05:10.400> half<00:05:10.610> off<00:05:10.700> was<00:05:10.880> only<00:05:11.090> $5

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
then because it was half off was only $5

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.840 
then because it was half off was only $5
so<00:05:12.740> I<00:05:12.800> thought<00:05:12.980> this<00:05:13.100> would<00:05:13.220> be<00:05:13.340> a<00:05:13.370> perfect
