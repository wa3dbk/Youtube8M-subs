bowl and make sure that everything is
mixed<00:02:01.350> in<00:02:01.620> it's<00:02:02.310> much<00:02:02.850> more<00:02:03.120> thoroughly<00:02:03.390> could

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
mixed in it's much more thoroughly could

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.750 
mixed in it's much more thoroughly could
ever<00:02:03.870> be<00:02:04.020> by<00:02:04.170> mixing<00:02:04.470> by<00:02:04.740> home<00:02:04.950> yeah<00:02:05.400> it's

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
ever be by mixing by home yeah it's

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.820 
ever be by mixing by home yeah it's
almost<00:02:05.940> as<00:02:06.270> if<00:02:06.420> it's<00:02:06.690> sort<00:02:06.930> of<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.440> know<00:02:07.560> some

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
almost as if it's sort of you know some

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.740 
almost as if it's sort of you know some
mixers<00:02:08.190> just<00:02:08.460> do<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.729> center<00:02:09.210> and<00:02:09.510> you<00:02:09.600> get

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
mixers just do the center and you get

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.990 
mixers just do the center and you get
lots<00:02:10.020> of<00:02:10.140> bits<00:02:10.380> left<00:02:10.590> around<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.040> outside<00:02:11.520> but

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
lots of bits left around the outside but

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.340 
lots of bits left around the outside but
actually<00:02:12.390> I<00:02:12.450> have<00:02:12.630> to<00:02:12.780> say<00:02:12.960> it's<00:02:13.140> a<00:02:13.200> lot

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
actually I have to say it's a lot

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.250 
actually I have to say it's a lot
quieter<00:02:13.620> quieter<00:02:14.130> than<00:02:14.460> I<00:02:14.580> thought<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:15.660> also

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
quieter quieter than I thought and also

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.380 
quieter quieter than I thought and also
I'm<00:02:16.560> really<00:02:16.590> impressed<00:02:17.310> that<00:02:17.520> it's<00:02:17.760> got<00:02:18.090> it's

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
I'm really impressed that it's got it's

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.500 
I'm really impressed that it's got it's
not<00:02:18.570> moving<00:02:19.050> at<00:02:19.170> all<00:02:19.350> on<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.950> surface<00:02:20.760> because

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
not moving at all on the surface because

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.090 
not moving at all on the surface because
you've<00:02:21.690> got<00:02:21.960> I<00:02:21.990> don't<00:02:22.170> know<00:02:22.350> if<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:22.620> can<00:02:22.830> see

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
you've got I don't know if you can see

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.980 
you've got I don't know if you can see
this<00:02:23.280> if<00:02:23.460> I<00:02:23.580> just<00:02:23.820> move<00:02:24.030> these<00:02:24.270> ingredients

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
this if I just move these ingredients

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.360 
this if I just move these ingredients
out<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.260> way<00:02:25.350> that<00:02:25.380> we've<00:02:25.680> got<00:02:25.890> you've<00:02:26.340> got

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
out the way that we've got you've got

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.670 
out the way that we've got you've got
four<00:02:26.880> suctions<00:02:27.600> feet<00:02:27.930> underneath<00:02:28.440> so<00:02:28.620> it

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
four suctions feet underneath so it

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.320 
four suctions feet underneath so it
really<00:02:28.920> does<00:02:29.130> hold<00:02:29.400> it<00:02:29.580> onto<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:29.940> surface

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
really does hold it onto the surface

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.570 
really does hold it onto the surface
brilliantly<00:02:30.960> as<00:02:31.710> it's<00:02:31.920> work<00:02:32.100> and<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:32.430> can
