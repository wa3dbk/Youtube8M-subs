00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.759
 and here is commenting and good today 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:09.060
 I will explain how to solve a 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.610
 problem of adobe photoshop cs 6 in 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:15.960
 windows 8 and good the only thing that you have 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:18.090
 what to do is go to your photoshop and the 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.390
 problem is that for example I want 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.330
 write a text and here I write you see and 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.230
 every letter I write turns red and 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.660
 for example when I have just written 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:33.270
 and I'm control t for example to move 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.190
 and you move it more or less blindly because 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.850
 it stays black and things like that 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.210
 so 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:46.000
 to solve this problem well I'm going 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.140
 to remove this that afterwards is going to be a 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.510
 youtube thing 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.629
 the only thing you have to do is good 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:55.390
 let's remove this is true let's what 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:58.540
 The only thing you have to do is open the 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.729
 photoshop again road takes me a lot 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.699
 already at last with this new computer is going to 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:07.960
 he had to shoot good and you have to go to 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:12.009
 edition to preferences and here you have to 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:14.200
 go to performance performance in this 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.630
 same page 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.700
 you have to go to this settings box 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.909
 of the graphics processor and settings 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.800
 advanced here put in drawing mode and 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.810
 a world will appear by default 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.119
 Advanced generally in windows 8 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.720
 new then you will have to put a 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.640
 basic you give ok ok and now for 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.340
 example I go to my desk I have 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:42.320
 here the picture and I'm here 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:47.159
 good that all this and now when I go to 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:49.979
 put the mega construction text 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:54.229
 nothing happens as you can see is a 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:59.009
 failure of configuration of discharge of 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:01.109
 adobe in windows 8 is not cost nothing 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.969
 fix it simply is to do this 

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:05.850
 small this little nonsense that you 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:08.819
 explains today or now so I do not expect anything 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.440
 that you liked it and nothing to like 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.190
 subscribe and until next time 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.190
 goodbye
