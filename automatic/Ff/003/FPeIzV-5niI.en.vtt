more scale details on this so let's have

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.550 
more scale details on this so let's have
a<00:00:21.689> look<00:00:21.869> in<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.109> box<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.560> see<00:00:22.710> what<00:00:22.859> we've<00:00:23.010> got

the<00:01:09.060> servos<00:01:09.930> already<00:01:10.229> installed<00:01:10.619> looks<00:01:10.890> like

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
the servos already installed looks like

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.800 
the servos already installed looks like
you<00:01:11.040> have<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.220> do<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.580> put<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.060> control<00:01:12.510> horns

really good as well normally when you
get<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.860> foam<00:01:20.100> model<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.970> can<00:01:21.119> kind<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.299> feel

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
get a foam model you can kind of feel

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.090 
get a foam model you can kind of feel
how<00:01:21.659> rough<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:22.020> is<00:01:22.080> on<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.320> top<00:01:22.560> they've

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
how rough it is on the top they've

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.340 
how rough it is on the top they've
actually<00:01:23.360> put<00:01:24.360> some<00:01:24.509> kind<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:24.750> finish<00:01:25.049> over

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
actually put some kind of finish over

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.679 
actually put some kind of finish over
there<00:01:25.530> zone<00:01:25.710> so<00:01:26.070> it's<00:01:26.220> very<00:01:26.369> smooth<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.180> if

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
there zone so it's very smooth and if

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:28.880 
there zone so it's very smooth and if

you're looking from a distance you can't
see<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.189> foam<00:01:29.840> from<00:01:30.840> Pat<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.140> minute<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:31.860> it's<00:01:31.979> a

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
see the foam from Pat a minute so it's a

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.620 
see the foam from Pat a minute so it's a
really<00:01:32.220> nice<00:01:32.460> looking<00:01:32.700> model<00:01:32.820> really<00:01:33.390> really

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
really nice looking model really really

really nice looking model really really
great<00:01:33.810> scale<00:01:34.140> details<00:01:34.619> on<00:01:34.829> this<00:01:35.180> so<00:01:36.180> that's

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
great scale details on this so that's

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:44.730 
great scale details on this so that's
the<00:01:36.659> wing<00:01:38.750> comes<00:01:39.750> with<00:01:39.990> two<00:01:40.229> of<00:01:40.380> those

wire here that's for hooking up the
scale<00:01:51.560> strobe<00:01:51.950> light<00:01:52.130> on<00:01:52.250> the<00:01:52.370> tail<00:01:52.550> now

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
scale strobe light on the tail now

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.550 
scale strobe light on the tail now
that's<00:01:53.270> all<00:01:53.450> ETL<00:01:53.810> hints<00:01:54.140> so<00:01:54.260> everything's

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
that's all ETL hints so everything's

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.110 
that's all ETL hints so everything's
hinged<00:01:54.890> in<00:01:54.980> place<00:01:55.220> all<00:01:55.460> you<00:01:55.520> have<00:01:55.640> to<00:01:55.700> do<00:01:55.850> is

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
hinged in place all you have to do is

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.710 
hinged in place all you have to do is
glue<00:01:56.930> it<00:01:57.050> down<00:01:57.230> again<00:01:57.650> control<00:01:58.220> horns<00:01:58.550> and

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
glue it down again control horns and

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:05.110 
glue it down again control horns and
control<00:01:59.720> rods<00:02:03.580> horizontal<00:02:04.580> stabilizer<00:02:04.970> is

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
control rods horizontal stabilizer is

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.270 
control rods horizontal stabilizer is
really<00:02:05.390> good<00:02:05.600> -<00:02:05.810> same<00:02:06.200> thing<00:02:06.560> and<00:02:06.830> you<00:02:07.130> can<00:02:07.190> see

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
really good - same thing and you can see

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.700 
really good - same thing and you can see
the<00:02:07.520> scale<00:02:07.820> corrugation<00:02:08.600> on<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.900> on<00:02:09.590> the

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
the scale corrugation on the on the

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.640 
the scale corrugation on the on the
control<00:02:10.040> surfaces<00:02:10.520> and<00:02:10.960> in<00:02:11.960> between<00:02:12.080> the<00:02:12.380> two

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
control surfaces and in between the two

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.790 
control surfaces and in between the two
halves<00:02:13.100> it's<00:02:13.430> got<00:02:13.760> a<00:02:13.930> plastic<00:02:14.930> control<00:02:15.560> so<00:02:15.770> you

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
halves it's got a plastic control so you

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.340 
halves it's got a plastic control so you
know<00:02:15.980> you're<00:02:16.130> not<00:02:16.220> going<00:02:16.340> to<00:02:16.400> get<00:02:16.550> any<00:02:16.670> split

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
know you're not going to get any split

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.740 
know you're not going to get any split

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.510 
so just came apart a nice solid scale
propeller<00:03:54.320> this<00:03:54.530> is<00:03:54.620> a<00:03:54.650> three-bladed<00:03:55.190> and

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:55.520 
propeller this is a three-bladed and

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.810 
propeller this is a three-bladed and
it's<00:03:55.850> an<00:03:56.000> 11<00:03:56.720> by<00:03:57.140> 9<00:03:57.590> prop<00:03:57.950> really<00:03:58.520> saw<00:03:58.670> it

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
it's an 11 by 9 prop really saw it

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.250 
it's an 11 by 9 prop really saw it
looking<00:03:59.690> and<00:04:00.070> sort<00:04:01.070> of<00:04:01.130> a<00:04:01.190> scale<00:04:02.020> outline<00:04:03.020> to

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
looking and sort of a scale outline to

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.870 
looking and sort of a scale outline to
it<00:04:03.380> it's<00:04:03.560> so<00:04:04.010> it's<00:04:04.190> gonna<00:04:04.310> look<00:04:04.370> really<00:04:04.640> good

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
it it's so it's gonna look really good

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.010 
it it's so it's gonna look really good
and<00:04:05.150> with<00:04:06.050> that<00:04:06.290> comes<00:04:06.980> a<00:04:07.250> scale<00:04:08.060> spinner<00:04:08.630> and

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.020 
and with that comes a scale spinner and

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.510 
and with that comes a scale spinner and
this<00:04:09.170> is<00:04:09.290> really<00:04:09.500> nice<00:04:09.620> it's<00:04:09.830> not<00:04:09.950> just<00:04:10.130> a<00:04:10.250> like

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:10.520 
this is really nice it's not just a like

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.680 
this is really nice it's not just a like
the<00:04:10.610> foam<00:04:10.790> spinner<00:04:11.060> that<00:04:11.240> sticks<00:04:11.480> on<00:04:11.600> the

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
the foam spinner that sticks on the

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.510 
the foam spinner that sticks on the
outside<00:04:11.960> of<00:04:12.080> a<00:04:12.110> plastic<00:04:12.470> one<00:04:12.590> this<00:04:13.340> actually

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:13.520 
outside of a plastic one this actually

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.630 
outside of a plastic one this actually
looks<00:04:13.790> pretty<00:04:13.940> good<00:04:14.120> and<00:04:14.390> pretty<00:04:15.459> solid<00:04:16.459> and

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
looks pretty good and pretty solid and

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.970 
looks pretty good and pretty solid and
should<00:04:17.000> stay<00:04:17.239> on<00:04:17.270> and<00:04:17.900> still<00:04:18.500> look<00:04:18.739> really

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980 
should stay on and still look really

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.710 
should stay on and still look really
sharp<00:04:19.130> I<00:04:19.310> like<00:04:19.459> silver<00:04:19.670> spinners<00:04:20.120> say<00:04:20.360> they

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
sharp I like silver spinners say they

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.330 
sharp I like silver spinners say they
look<00:04:20.870> really<00:04:21.049> nice<00:04:21.170> when<00:04:21.470> they're<00:04:21.620> turning

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.210 

this<00:04:25.340> little<00:04:25.640> bag<00:04:26.000> of<00:04:26.210> goodies<00:04:26.450> here<00:04:26.780> or<00:04:27.220> are

this little bag of goodies here or are
some<00:04:28.400> of<00:04:28.430> the<00:04:28.580> scale<00:04:28.880> details<00:04:29.300> on<00:04:29.480> it<00:04:29.600> and

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
some of the scale details on it and

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.390 
some of the scale details on it and
you'll<00:04:30.260> see<00:04:30.350> when<00:04:30.740> you<00:04:30.830> look<00:04:30.980> on<00:04:31.070> the<00:04:31.190> next

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
you'll see when you look on the next

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.470 
you'll see when you look on the next
video<00:04:31.610> the<00:04:31.700> flight<00:04:31.880> video<00:04:32.030> I'll<00:04:32.240> show<00:04:32.450> you

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
video the flight video I'll show you

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.430 
video the flight video I'll show you
what<00:04:32.630> it<00:04:32.810> looks<00:04:32.960> like<00:04:33.050> when<00:04:33.230> it's<00:04:33.320> together

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
what it looks like when it's together

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.530 
what it looks like when it's together
but<00:04:33.770> there's<00:04:33.920> some<00:04:34.070> antennas<00:04:35.000> that<00:04:35.150> stick<00:04:35.390> on

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
but there's some antennas that stick on

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.610 
but there's some antennas that stick on
the<00:04:35.660> top<00:04:36.880> about<00:04:37.880> your<00:04:38.000> fairings<00:04:38.540> for<00:04:38.960> the<00:04:39.230> the

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
the top about your fairings for the the

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.810 
the top about your fairings for the the
struts<00:04:40.000> and<00:04:41.000> a<00:04:41.750> couple<00:04:41.960> other<00:04:42.400> scale<00:04:43.400> antenna

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
struts and a couple other scale antenna

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.640 
struts and a couple other scale antenna
looking<00:04:44.180> doodads<00:04:44.510> in<00:04:44.720> there<00:04:44.870> and<00:04:45.380> I'll<00:04:45.620> just

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
looking doodads in there and I'll just

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.640 
looking doodads in there and I'll just
plonk<00:04:46.550> on<00:04:46.730> and<00:04:47.030> and<00:04:47.300> make<00:04:47.840> it<00:04:47.870> look<00:04:48.140> like<00:04:48.410> a

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
plonk on and and make it look like a

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.890 
plonk on and and make it look like a
really<00:04:48.950> sharp<00:04:49.850> scale<00:04:50.270> airplanes<00:04:52.780> which<00:04:53.780> just

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
really sharp scale airplanes which just

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.830 
really sharp scale airplanes which just
comes<00:04:54.020> with<00:04:54.170> a<00:04:54.350> whole<00:04:54.530> lot<00:04:54.890> of<00:04:55.450> control<00:04:56.450> harms

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
comes with a whole lot of control harms

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.150 
comes with a whole lot of control harms
and<00:04:57.080> connections<00:04:57.650> you<00:04:58.040> need<00:04:59.830> more<00:05:00.830> of<00:05:00.980> those

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
and connections you need more of those

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.320 
and connections you need more of those
some<00:05:01.670> tools<00:05:03.100> some<00:05:04.100> velcro<00:05:04.670> and<00:05:04.880> some<00:05:05.060> bolts

some tools some velcro and some bolts

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.890 
some tools some velcro and some bolts
for<00:05:05.480> the<00:05:05.570> wing<00:05:05.840> and<00:05:06.080> etc<00:05:06.500> on<00:05:07.720> there's<00:05:08.720> the

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
for the wing and etc on there's the

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.510 
for the wing and etc on there's the
struts<00:05:09.200> these<00:05:09.650> are<00:05:09.740> actually<00:05:09.950> pretty<00:05:10.070> pretty

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
struts these are actually pretty pretty

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.010 
struts these are actually pretty pretty
solid<00:05:10.850> that's<00:05:10.970> gonna<00:05:11.090> be<00:05:11.270> tensional<00:05:11.780> in<00:05:11.900> these

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
solid that's gonna be tensional in these

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.980 
solid that's gonna be tensional in these
but<00:05:12.230> they're<00:05:13.060> they<00:05:14.060> should<00:05:14.210> hold<00:05:14.330> the<00:05:14.540> the

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
but they're they should hold the the

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.390 
but they're they should hold the the
wing<00:05:15.170> together<00:05:15.500> and<00:05:15.680> make<00:05:15.800> it<00:05:15.920> to<00:05:16.040> a<00:05:16.070> really

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
wing together and make it to a really

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.300 
wing together and make it to a really
solid<00:05:16.670> shape<00:05:17.530> comes<00:05:18.530> with<00:05:18.680> tools<00:05:18.950> we've<00:05:19.160> got<00:05:19.280> a

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
solid shape comes with tools we've got a

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.580 
solid shape comes with tools we've got a
screwdriver<00:05:19.520> and<00:05:20.060> some<00:05:20.270> zip<00:05:20.480> ties<00:05:20.540> for<00:05:21.140> for

Cessna 206 the languor was a little bit

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.890 
Cessna 206 the languor was a little bit
on<00:05:33.710> the<00:05:33.830> flimsy<00:05:34.160> side<00:05:34.370> these<00:05:35.240> ones<00:05:35.510> here<00:05:35.690> seem

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
on the flimsy side these ones here seem

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.600 
on the flimsy side these ones here seem
very<00:05:36.080> solid<00:05:36.470> and<00:05:36.620> they're<00:05:36.950> very<00:05:37.130> scale

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
very solid and they're very scale

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.850 
very solid and they're very scale
looking<00:05:38.000> as<00:05:38.210> I<00:05:38.510> will<00:05:38.660> show<00:05:38.690> you

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
so they just slide in place in the

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.270 
so they just slide in place in the
fuselage<00:05:43.380> as<00:05:43.590> you<00:05:43.650> can<00:05:43.740> see<00:05:43.890> it's<00:05:44.010> got<00:05:44.130> this

the<00:06:46.770> power<00:06:46.980> tomorrow<00:06:47.700> this<00:06:47.820> model<00:06:48.150> it's<00:06:48.360> a

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 
the power tomorrow this model it's a

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.950 
the power tomorrow this model it's a
2,200<00:06:49.800> milliamp<00:06:50.400> hour<00:06:50.670> 3-cell<00:06:51.330> battery<00:06:51.360> and

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960 
2,200 milliamp hour 3-cell battery and

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.530 
2,200 milliamp hour 3-cell battery and
25<00:06:52.710> C<00:06:53.040> so<00:06:53.280> there's<00:06:53.580> some<00:06:53.700> good<00:06:53.850> solar<00:06:54.060> power<00:06:54.330> in

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:54.540 
25 C so there's some good solar power in

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.080 
25 C so there's some good solar power in
this<00:06:54.690> the<00:06:55.350> the<00:06:55.770> original<00:06:56.070> one<00:06:56.190> was<00:06:56.220> a<00:06:56.370> two<00:06:56.790> cell

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:57.090 
this the the original one was a two cell

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.500 
this the the original one was a two cell
late<00:06:57.510> hundred<00:06:57.810> million<00:06:58.110> power<00:06:58.290> 1100<00:06:59.510> this

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:00.510 
late hundred million power 1100 this

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:01.880 
late hundred million power 1100 this
gonna<00:07:00.720> have<00:07:00.810> a<00:07:00.840> lot<00:07:01.020> more<00:07:01.050> more<00:07:01.530> ability<00:07:01.860> I

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:01.890 
gonna have a lot more more ability I

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:03.140 
gonna have a lot more more ability I
think<00:07:02.130> there's<00:07:02.250> more<00:07:02.370> scale<00:07:02.610> detail<00:07:02.970> on<00:07:03.120> it

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:03.150 
think there's more scale detail on it

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:04.640 
think there's more scale detail on it
it's<00:07:03.360> a<00:07:03.420> little<00:07:03.570> bit<00:07:03.720> bigger<00:07:03.990> so<00:07:04.440> it's<00:07:04.560> going

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:04.650 
it's a little bit bigger so it's going

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.320 
it's a little bit bigger so it's going
to<00:07:04.740> require<00:07:04.920> more<00:07:05.100> power<00:07:05.280> this<00:07:05.970> size<00:07:06.210> of

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:06.330 
to require more power this size of

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:09.860 
to require more power this size of
battery<00:07:06.630> is<00:07:06.750> is<00:07:07.230> quite<00:07:07.560> common<00:07:08.400> and<00:07:08.700> it's<00:07:09.510> so

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:09.870
