Park in there mixing with the new stuff
this<00:01:26.580> here<00:01:26.909> would<00:01:27.180> have<00:01:27.270> been<00:01:27.330> part<00:01:27.720> of<00:01:27.810> the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
this here would have been part of the

this here would have been part of the
original<00:01:28.049> park<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:28.890> guess<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.460> fountain

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
original park and I guess the fountain
