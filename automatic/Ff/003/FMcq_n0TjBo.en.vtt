that<00:01:14.369> go<00:01:14.580> invisible<00:01:14.820> here<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.890> i<00:01:16.890> don't<00:01:17.220> think

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
that go invisible here and i don't think

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.890 
that go invisible here and i don't think
they<00:01:17.400> can<00:01:17.520> see<00:01:17.729> me<00:01:17.850> so<00:01:18.060> now<00:01:18.150> we<00:01:18.210> go<00:01:18.420> here<00:01:18.780> and

just go right behind people and tap on

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.660 
just go right behind people and tap on
blocks<00:01:22.049> i<00:01:22.200> think<00:01:22.380> there<00:01:22.530> we<00:01:22.650> go<00:01:22.799> oh<00:01:23.009> gosh<00:01:23.280> okay

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.760 
blocks i think there we go oh gosh okay
um<00:01:24.200> and<00:01:25.200> whatever<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.500> need<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.650> use<00:01:25.740> the

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
um and whatever you need to use the

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.140 
um and whatever you need to use the
pickaxe<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.280> don't<00:01:26.400> think<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:26.729> just<00:01:27.000> keep

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
pickaxe I don't think so just keep

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.520 
pickaxe I don't think so just keep
getting<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.509> invisible<00:01:27.869> thing<00:01:28.080> here's<00:01:28.380> my

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
getting the invisible thing here's my

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.050 
getting the invisible thing here's my
kind<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.829> my<00:01:29.100> strategy<00:01:29.490> for<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.909> keep

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
kind of my strategy for is you keep

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.910 
kind of my strategy for is you keep
going<00:01:30.270> invisible<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:31.020> going<00:01:31.350> behind<00:01:31.470> people

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
going invisible and going behind people
