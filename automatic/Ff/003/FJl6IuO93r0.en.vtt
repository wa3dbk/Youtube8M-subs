too late and what you're going to do is

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.620 
too late and what you're going to do is
learn<00:00:31.410> how<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.710> jump<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.399> way<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.850> keep<00:00:33.480> the

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
learn how to jump the way and keep the

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.810 
learn how to jump the way and keep the
line<00:00:33.840> tight<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.770> way<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:34.980> do<00:00:35.219> this<00:00:35.399> is

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
line tight and the way to do this is

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.700 
line tight and the way to do this is
when<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.180> rise<00:00:36.390> up<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.719> way<00:00:36.870> push<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.469> board

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
when you rise up the way push the board

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.350 
when you rise up the way push the board
in<00:00:37.829> front<00:00:38.040> of<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.489> load<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.000> tail<00:00:39.210> the

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
in front of it and load the tail the

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.880 
in front of it and load the tail the
board<00:00:39.570> up<00:00:39.719> weight<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.320> tail<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.710> board

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
board up weight the tail of the board

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.369 
board up weight the tail of the board
and<00:00:41.460> what<00:00:41.610> that's<00:00:41.820> going<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.090> do<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.570> load<00:00:43.110> your

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
and what that's going to do is load your

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.930 
and what that's going to do is load your
line<00:00:43.590> up<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.100> when<00:00:44.219> you're<00:00:44.370> in<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.789> air

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
line up so that when you're in the air

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.580 
line up so that when you're in the air
the<00:00:45.390> handle<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:45.870> actually<00:00:46.140> going<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.320> be<00:00:46.410> going

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
the handle is actually going to be going

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.110 
the handle is actually going to be going
away<00:00:46.680> from<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:47.039> because<00:00:47.219> you're<00:00:47.700> stopping

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
away from you because you're stopping

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.430 
away from you because you're stopping
your<00:00:48.210> body<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.690> boat's<00:00:48.930> traveling

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
your body and the boat's traveling

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.740 
your body and the boat's traveling
forward<00:00:49.800> so<00:00:50.190> you're<00:00:50.309> loading<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.850> line<00:00:51.059> up<00:00:51.239> so

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
forward so you're loading the line up so

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.150 
forward so you're loading the line up so
then<00:00:51.899> all<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.170> have<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.440> do<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.739> once<00:00:53.010> you're

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
then all you have to do is once you're

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.189 
then all you have to do is once you're
at<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.370> peak<00:00:53.579> your<00:00:53.879> trick<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.539> you<00:00:54.719> rise<00:00:54.930> up

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
at the peak your trick and you rise up

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.660 
at the peak your trick and you rise up
and<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.379> have<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.559> peak<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.829> your<00:00:55.920> trick<00:00:56.160> just

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
and you have the peak of your trick just

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.090 
and you have the peak of your trick just
pull<00:00:57.090> on<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.420> rope<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.840> that's<00:00:58.410> gonna<00:00:58.770> ignite

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
pull on the rope and that's gonna ignite

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.099 
pull on the rope and that's gonna ignite
the<00:00:59.280> front<00:00:59.520> flip<00:00:59.730> landing<00:01:00.570> this<00:01:00.780> trick<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.079> a

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
the front flip landing this trick is a

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.750 
the front flip landing this trick is a
little<00:01:01.379> tricky<00:01:01.620> if<00:01:01.980> you've<00:01:02.160> ever<00:01:02.309> done<00:01:02.489> one<00:01:02.670> on

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
little tricky if you've ever done one on

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.310 
little tricky if you've ever done one on
a<00:01:02.789> trampoline<00:01:03.210> you'll<00:01:03.600> realize<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:03.989> you

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
a trampoline you'll realize that you

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.750 
a trampoline you'll realize that you
won't<00:01:04.500> be<00:01:04.619> able<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.860> spot<00:01:05.040> your<00:01:05.280> landing<00:01:05.309> into

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
won't be able to spot your landing into

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.789 
won't be able to spot your landing into
the<00:01:05.939> last<00:01:06.180> split<00:01:06.510> second<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.380> when<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.560> do<00:01:07.710> it

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
the last split second so when you do it

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:08.330 
the last split second so when you do it
on<00:01:07.920> water

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
on water

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.520 
on water
be<00:01:08.970> ready<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.240> anticipate<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.960> landing<00:01:10.320> it's

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
be ready to anticipate the landing it's

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.080 
be ready to anticipate the landing it's
gonna<00:01:10.710> be<00:01:10.890> tricky<00:01:11.100> it's<00:01:11.369> gonna<00:01:11.520> be<00:01:11.670> late<00:01:11.850> but

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
gonna be tricky it's gonna be late but

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.760 
gonna be tricky it's gonna be late but
just<00:01:12.270> be<00:01:12.420> ready<00:01:12.600> for<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:12.960> use<00:01:13.260> your<00:01:13.439> knees<00:01:13.590> and

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
just be ready for it use your knees and

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.289 
just be ready for it use your knees and
you<00:01:13.860> should<00:01:14.040> be<00:01:14.159> fine

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.270 

the<00:01:18.780> second<00:01:19.140> one<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.320> want<00:01:19.469> to<00:01:19.530> try<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:20.070> the

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
the second one you want to try is the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.249 
the second one you want to try is the
cartwheel<00:01:20.579> front<00:01:21.000> flip<00:01:21.210> most<00:01:21.689> people<00:01:22.020> do<00:01:22.140> it

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
cartwheel front flip most people do it

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.109 
cartwheel front flip most people do it
this<00:01:22.380> way<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:23.159> way<00:01:23.310> you're<00:01:23.460> gonna<00:01:23.609> do<00:01:23.789> it<00:01:23.969> is

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
this way the way you're gonna do it is

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.209 
this way the way you're gonna do it is
you<00:01:24.270> want<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.509> get<00:01:24.630> wide<00:01:25.049> on<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.289> boat<00:01:25.530> coming

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:26.219 
you want to get wide on the boat coming

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:27.620 
you want to get wide on the boat coming
with<00:01:26.340> more<00:01:26.549> speed<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:27.030> speed<00:01:27.179> is<00:01:27.450> what's

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
with more speed the speed is what's

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.569 
with more speed the speed is what's
going<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.899> allow<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.710> finish<00:01:29.100> your<00:01:29.369> front
