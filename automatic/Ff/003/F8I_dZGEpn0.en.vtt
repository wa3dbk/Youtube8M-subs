I<00:01:15.840> was<00:01:16.049> gonna<00:01:16.170> raise<00:01:16.439> every<00:01:16.770> button<00:01:17.009> because<00:01:17.580> I

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
I was gonna raise every button because I

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.120

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.780 
I just think I'm better post-flop and I
didn't<00:01:25.619> want<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.830> get<00:01:25.920> into<00:01:26.070> too<00:01:26.189> many<00:01:26.310> preflop

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.290 
and I just thought that I could outplay
him<00:02:06.880> and<00:02:07.720> I<00:02:07.900> didn't<00:02:08.229> want<00:02:08.380> to<00:02:08.470> risk<00:02:09.030> 24<00:02:10.030> million

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
him and I didn't want to risk 24 million

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.850 
him and I didn't want to risk 24 million
or<00:02:10.539> whatever<00:02:10.630> it<00:02:10.929> was<00:02:11.080> at<00:02:11.230> that<00:02:11.260> point<00:02:11.410> I<00:02:11.830> just

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
or whatever it was at that point I just

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.920 
or whatever it was at that point I just
wanted<00:02:12.280> to<00:02:12.489> keep<00:02:12.880> the<00:02:13.090> chips<00:02:13.330> and<00:02:13.569> just<00:02:13.720> keep

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
wanted to keep the chips and just keep

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.050 
wanted to keep the chips and just keep
it<00:02:14.080> small<00:02:14.550> makes<00:02:15.550> sense

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
it small makes sense

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.479 
it small makes sense
so<00:02:16.239> now<00:02:16.420> eight<00:02:17.230> point<00:02:17.590> three<00:02:17.800> million<00:02:18.099> dollars

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489
