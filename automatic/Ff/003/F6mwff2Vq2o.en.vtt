00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
way that it won't like be like these two

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.289 
way that it won't like be like these two

I<00:02:45.980> had<00:02:46.459> accidentally<00:02:47.030> broke<00:02:47.209> my<00:02:47.330> ipod<00:02:47.480> that<00:02:47.930> I

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
I had accidentally broke my ipod that I

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:49.660 
I had accidentally broke my ipod that I
had<00:02:48.170> encrypted<00:02:48.680> it<00:02:48.769> so<00:02:48.890> it<00:02:49.010> permanently<00:02:49.459> say

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
had encrypted it so it permanently say

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
had encrypted it so it permanently say
ages<00:02:50.000> itouch<00:02:50.330> instead<00:02:50.630> of<00:02:50.720> slide<00:02:50.870> unlock<00:02:52.209> so<00:02:53.209> I

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
ages itouch instead of slide unlock so I

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.410 
ages itouch instead of slide unlock so I
was<00:02:54.170> freaking<00:02:54.860> out<00:02:54.950> and<00:02:55.130> I<00:02:55.310> just<00:02:55.489> realized<00:02:56.000> I

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
was freaking out and I just realized I

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.479 
was freaking out and I just realized I
could<00:02:57.290> have<00:02:57.380> done<00:02:57.500> the<00:02:57.650> create<00:02:57.920> is<00:02:58.010> new<00:02:58.220> which

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
could have done the create is new which

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.000 
could have done the create is new which
I<00:02:58.790> put<00:02:59.510> 2+2<00:02:59.720> together<00:03:00.110> and<00:03:00.500> figured<00:03:00.709> out<00:03:00.829> it

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
I put 2+2 together and figured out it

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.280 
I put 2+2 together and figured out it
would<00:03:01.099> erase<00:03:01.400> all<00:03:01.640> the<00:03:01.730> other<00:03:01.849> data<00:03:02.060> so<00:03:02.569> that's

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
would erase all the other data so that's

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.370 
would erase all the other data so that's
what<00:03:03.470> you<00:03:03.500> have<00:03:03.709> to<00:03:03.739> do<00:03:03.980> in<00:03:04.250> order<00:03:04.610> to<00:03:04.819> properly

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
what you have to do in order to properly

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.150 
what you have to do in order to properly
unjailbreak<00:03:06.380> with<00:03:07.040> no<00:03:07.430> problems<00:03:08.030> whatsoever
