00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 winter is now well underway 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.170
 it's the right time to sow his 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.170
 annual flowers 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:13.320
 we are going to sow its annual flowers to 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.389
 inside to heat and especially to the 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.980
 light for that I chose a terrine 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.170
 then a terrine of recovery you 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.630
 know what are these famous terrine that 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.699
 serve to put cadets cakes 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.269
 or other other products 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.949
 food 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.830
 she is not pierced and I'm not going 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.349
 the breakthrough so that we do not change 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.450
 not your shelves two windows by 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.450
 the following for that it will have to drained 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.700
 generously dre with balls 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:46.950
 of clay drain the bottom of the terrine 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:50.250
 a bit like a tank with water reserves on 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.079
 will fill the special soil subject 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.640
 or find it quite easily in the 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.840
 trade 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.870
 the interest of this soil is that it is 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.480
 poor it is filtering is well suited 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.049
 to sowing and milling it is necessary 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:08.119
 fill our terrine the hall is 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:12.119
 enough we will complete over 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:15.900
 and always this same soil so the 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.460
 ja there is no mixing, so 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.890
 do not be afraid in the m it 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.140
 could make it overflow afterwards 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.700
 we will tax a little bit the end of his 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:32.400
 fingers like that especially around the 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:32.610
 gardener and we will legalize until 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.909
 top 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.259
 with a rule now we will break 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:42.630
 this planter this terrine 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:45.060
 slightly slightly from the front we have 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.750
 simply to equalize the potting soil 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.210
 is no more I chose seeds from 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.590
 flowers for balcony so these are 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.450
 flowers that are adapted of course 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.189
 for the balconies you will notice that he 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.810
 was closed iv sorbonne which allows 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.860
 to make it hermetic masters of 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.820
 can reuse it 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:06.630
 as long as we want we will use a drill 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.460
 to properly distribute the seeds read a 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.040
 seeder and it's handy 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.330
 so there are flowers for balcony 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:17.430
 ie on flowers that are 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.960
 suitable for planters so we go 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.490
 spread a few seeds to 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.590
 inside so we can see that he 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.330
 are all kinds of seeds to 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.730
 inside as well see the flowers 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.420
 vine perhaps why not 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:34.530
 petunias flowers pretty easy in 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:37.770
 general rule and we will sow them votes 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.980
 sow the seeds in part then in them 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.840
 dispersing the best possible 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.020
 sowing must be regular who knows 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:50.400
 water harvest menu and this is a rule 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:55.070
 when we sow our seeds we have 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:59.130
 finished the smi we will keep our package 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:04.020
 and we will enjoy this terrine for 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:06.750
 to separate it in two since we have 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:11.400
 widely and we will sow carnations 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:13.050
 gives these young people the particularity of 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.720
 to sprout very quickly it's also good 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.940
 carnations of india to mix why not 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.220
 with the tomatoes in the spring a 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.960
 this year mathy side then there useless 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.390
 to use this month it's the very very 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:28.410
 big seed we spread them over any 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:31.560
 the surface of the terrine 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:35.160
 now we will go and we will especially 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.930
 well packed our semi extremely 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.810
 important the gale is coming 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:45.960
 slightly to equalize but here it goes 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:48.170
 have to apply the seed well to the 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.170
 Earth 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:58.840
 Here is a good time we began 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:04:00.550
 well packed we water then there we go 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.380
 rest a little more was well 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:07.180
 watered the surface when I say we water 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:09.490
 we spray a misunderstanding so we 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.440
 sprays we did not soak our 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:14.080
 terrine there an explanation also since 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.170
 it's a terrine we breakthrough it's a 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.720
 little like a tank with water reserves that 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:21.549
 to avoid also the bar of 2 shoes 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.110
 your two- room dining table 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.720
 on the edge of your window 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.560
 it's the simplest technique and 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.720
 it is easy to do 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:35.140
 once we have watered we will cover 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:37.690
 plastic bins and one practices a 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:40.780
 culture to the tuft and that is to say that 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:43.900
 the moisture will stay inside and 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.880
 the seeds will germinate after going 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.830
 after a short week following 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.420
 species according to the species of seeds 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.060
 once it's going to germinate 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:54.220
 we will open slightly then treat me 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.900
 little hold like that for about 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:59.350
 a week the time that all 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:03.280
 seeds germinate regularly 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:06.520
 week later you withdraw the 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:10.540
 covered all your seeds have managed well 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:12.490
 but start to push well you go 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.990
 leave about one more week and 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.630
 after one week, weeks later 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.890
 still caught your germ to the plants 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.500
 your young plants your young flowers 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:23.169
 annuals and you go get them back and 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.419
 to transplant them one by one in a 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:28.450
 other terrine of course this is our 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:30.430
 semi now is over I you 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:33.780
 really want a very, very, very good 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.780
 sowing of annual flowers
