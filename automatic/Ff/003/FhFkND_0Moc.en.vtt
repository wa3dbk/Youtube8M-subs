00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
hey guys and this is Fatima ring in this

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.280 
hey guys and this is Fatima ring in this
video<00:00:05.339> I'm<00:00:05.700> going<00:00:05.970> to<00:00:06.089> teach<00:00:06.359> you<00:00:06.390> what<00:00:06.930> test

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
video I'm going to teach you what test

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.379 
video I'm going to teach you what test
crop<00:00:07.740> and<00:00:08.389> backcross<00:00:09.420> is<00:00:09.630> well<00:00:11.030> let's<00:00:12.030> start

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
crop and backcross is well let's start

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:23.900 
crop and backcross is well let's start
off<00:00:12.540> by<00:00:12.780> saying<00:00:20.600> okay<00:00:21.600> that's<00:00:22.050> done<00:00:22.519> if<00:00:23.519> you

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
off by saying okay that's done if you

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.839 
off by saying okay that's done if you
were<00:00:24.119> told<00:00:24.390> then<00:00:25.230> first<00:00:26.130> let<00:00:26.340> me<00:00:26.369> tell<00:00:26.670> you

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
were told then first let me tell you

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.080 
were told then first let me tell you
what<00:00:27.119> actually<00:00:27.779> backcross<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.760> that<00:00:29.760> growth

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
what actually backcross is that growth

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.889 
what actually backcross is that growth
means<00:00:30.890> crossing<00:00:31.890> off<00:00:32.279> f1<00:00:32.790> hybrid<00:00:33.239> offsprings

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
means crossing off f1 hybrid offsprings

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.370 
means crossing off f1 hybrid offsprings
with<00:00:34.200> any<00:00:34.440> one<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.160> parent<00:00:35.579> okay<00:00:36.380> okay

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
with any one of the parent okay okay

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.950 
with any one of the parent okay okay
let's<00:00:37.649> see<00:00:37.890> what<00:00:38.100> does<00:00:38.250> this<00:00:38.460> mean<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:39.149> looks

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
let's see what does this mean it looks

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.560 
let's see what does this mean it looks
quite<00:00:40.170> confusing<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.670> must<00:00:41.910> be<00:00:42.030> baffled

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
quite confusing and you must be baffled

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.250 
quite confusing and you must be baffled
but<00:00:43.379> as<00:00:43.800> we<00:00:44.340> will<00:00:44.399> study<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:45.059> plant<00:00:45.539> crossing

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
but as we will study this plant crossing

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.110 
but as we will study this plant crossing
you<00:00:46.559> will<00:00:46.680> get<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.070> know<00:00:47.219> easily<00:00:47.910> what

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
you will get to know easily what

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.779 
you will get to know easily what
actually<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:48.960> is

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
actually it is

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:53.959 
actually it is
suppose<00:00:50.789> we<00:00:51.180> are<00:00:51.210> crossing<00:00:52.020> on<00:00:52.620> this<00:00:53.430> your

as f1 hybrid or f1 generation so they

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.069

remember hetero means different they are

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.070 
remember hetero means different they are
all<00:02:14.500> different<00:02:14.730> but<00:02:15.730> they<00:02:16.180> got<00:02:16.420> a<00:02:16.450> dominant

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
all different but they got a dominant

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.030 
all different but they got a dominant
character<00:02:17.620> of<00:02:17.830> tallness<00:02:18.220> k<00:02:19.060> so<00:02:19.900> capital<00:02:20.739> T

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
character of tallness k so capital T

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.490 
character of tallness k so capital T
small<00:02:21.220> T<00:02:21.430> that's<00:02:22.090> why<00:02:22.420> one<00:02:22.690> is<00:02:22.870> dominant<00:02:23.110> and

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
small T that's why one is dominant and

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.740 
small T that's why one is dominant and
the<00:02:23.650> other<00:02:23.830> is<00:02:24.069> recessive<00:02:24.489> so<00:02:25.209> they<00:02:25.390> are<00:02:25.480> all

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
the other is recessive so they are all

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.850 
the other is recessive so they are all
tall<00:02:26.170> hybrid<00:02:26.739> slash<00:02:27.010> or<00:02:27.370> heterozygous<00:02:27.940> one<00:02:28.860> so

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
tall hybrid slash or heterozygous one so

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.729 
tall hybrid slash or heterozygous one so
we<00:02:30.670> got<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.150> offspring<00:02:31.780> by<00:02:31.989> crossing<00:02:32.290> these

we got the offspring by crossing these

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.570 
we got the offspring by crossing these

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
small T T is dominant so there are two
