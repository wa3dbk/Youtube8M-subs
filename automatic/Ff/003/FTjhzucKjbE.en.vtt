and just keep going and just separating

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.550 
and just keep going and just separating
the<00:02:16.510> hair<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.970> never<00:02:19.510> putting<00:02:20.020> a<00:02:20.110> brush<00:02:20.350> or<00:02:20.500> a

the hair and never putting a brush or a
comb<00:02:20.650> to<00:02:21.100> it<00:02:21.250> so<00:02:21.400> you<00:02:21.460> can<00:02:21.730> see<00:02:21.940> with<00:02:22.150> the

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
comb to it so you can see with the

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.530 
comb to it so you can see with the
amount<00:02:22.600> of<00:02:22.720> hair<00:02:23.050> that<00:02:23.230> this<00:02:23.440> horse<00:02:23.680> has

amount of hair that this horse has

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.480 
amount of hair that this horse has
estimated<00:02:25.540> will<00:02:25.660> take<00:02:25.870> me<00:02:26.050> about<00:02:26.350> at<00:02:27.160> least

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
estimated will take me about at least

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.150 
estimated will take me about at least
half<00:02:28.390> an<00:02:28.570> hour<00:02:28.660> to<00:02:28.930> 45<00:02:29.440> minutes<00:02:29.470> to<00:02:29.980> go<00:02:30.130> through

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
half an hour to 45 minutes to go through

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.720 
half an hour to 45 minutes to go through
the<00:02:30.460> tail<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:30.970> tail<00:02:31.000> like<00:02:31.420> this<00:02:35.400> but<00:02:36.400> this<00:02:36.550> is

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
the tail the tail like this but this is

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.180 
the tail the tail like this but this is
the<00:02:36.760> classic<00:02:37.330> way<00:02:37.480> of<00:02:37.510> doing<00:02:37.990> it<00:02:38.190> there's

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
the classic way of doing it there's

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.420 
the classic way of doing it there's
actually<00:02:39.370> a<00:02:39.640> cavalry<00:02:40.360> guideline<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:42.040> German

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
actually a cavalry guideline the German

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.910 
actually a cavalry guideline the German
cavalry<00:02:42.820> hasn't<00:02:43.300> had<00:02:43.780> a<00:02:43.810> grooming<00:02:44.350> guideline

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
cavalry hasn't had a grooming guideline

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.600 
cavalry hasn't had a grooming guideline
and<00:02:45.280> it<00:02:45.700> specifically<00:02:46.390> said<00:02:46.780> to<00:02:47.440> never<00:02:47.770> put<00:02:48.550> a

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
and it specifically said to never put a

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.370 
and it specifically said to never put a
comb<00:02:49.000> or<00:02:49.330> a<00:02:49.840> brush<00:02:49.930> to<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.710> horse's<00:02:51.310> tail<00:02:52.380> so

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
comb or a brush to the horse's tail so

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.990 
comb or a brush to the horse's tail so
this<00:02:53.560> is<00:02:53.710> how<00:02:53.830> we<00:02:53.890> would<00:02:54.130> go<00:02:54.400> through<00:02:54.730> the

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
this is how we would go through the

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.660 
this is how we would go through the
entire<00:02:55.330> tail<00:02:55.750> see<00:02:56.200> this<00:02:56.470> is<00:02:56.590> all<00:02:56.860> we<00:02:57.040> have<00:02:57.220> done

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
entire tail see this is all we have done

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.270 
entire tail see this is all we have done
so<00:02:57.910> far<00:02:57.940> and<00:02:58.480> this<00:02:59.110> is<00:02:59.200> what<00:02:59.350> we<00:02:59.530> still<00:02:59.830> have<00:03:00.070> to

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
so far and this is what we still have to

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.950 
so far and this is what we still have to
do<00:03:00.460> and<00:03:00.850> it<00:03:01.780> would<00:03:01.930> take<00:03:02.110> us<00:03:02.140> a<00:03:02.290> very<00:03:02.560> long<00:03:02.800> time

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
do and it would take us a very long time

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.920 
do and it would take us a very long time
and<00:03:04.960> since<00:03:05.770> we're<00:03:06.100> in<00:03:06.130> the<00:03:06.550> Year<00:03:06.730> 2015<00:03:07.480> and

time<00:03:11.250> we<00:03:12.250> can<00:03:12.430> use<00:03:12.610> method<00:03:13.210> V<00:03:13.420> which<00:03:13.900> is<00:03:14.140> a

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
time we can use method V which is a

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.800 
time we can use method V which is a
really<00:03:14.740> good<00:03:15.190> quality<00:03:15.520> to<00:03:16.060> tangler<00:03:16.510> and<00:03:16.720> I

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
going to really work this into the tail

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.790 
going to really work this into the tail
I<00:03:59.460> can<00:04:00.090> feel<00:04:00.420> how<00:04:00.660> nice<00:04:00.870> and<00:04:01.140> sleek<00:04:01.410> this<00:04:01.650> is
