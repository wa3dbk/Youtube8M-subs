00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:07.099
 today we are going to make a lemon pie without 

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:10.429
 need to use the oven what we're going 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:13.879
 to need are three and a half cups of 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:17.240
 milk two boxes of instant slurry 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:19.610
 lemon of 3.4 ounces each two boxes of 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.920
 eight ounce cream cheese each one 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.140
 cup of sugar or splenda two 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.020
 teaspoons of fresh lemon juice 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.870
 squeezed one or two paris crusts and 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:33.540
 prepared and with egg to taste 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:36.330
 what we are going to do first is to do the 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.450
 touring so let's pour the milk 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:42.720
 in a bowl the three and a half cups 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:46.940
 and we are going to add the two boxes of 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.940
 for an instant lemon 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:55.050
 we are going to beat it very well until the 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.050
 consistency of this thick 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.410
 and we're going to put it in the fridge 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.400
 Now let's make the mixture with the 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.640
 cream cheese let's put the cream cheese 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:13.369
 in a container we will add the 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.920
 cup of sugar or splenda according to 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.830
 preference of each and we are going to 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.540
 put 2 teaspoons of lemon juice 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.300
 freshly squeezed 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:28.530
 we're going to beat it with the blender 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:31.350
 because it 's premature and we 're going to beat it 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.909
 until all the 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.179
 ingredients 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:39.939
 we are going to pour it very well until it 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:43.740
 mix all the ingredients and even 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:43.740
 that the mixture is smooth 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.560
 i 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.440
 well now we can put together the bread like this 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:56.630
 let's make a layer of the mixture 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.630
 of cream cheese with lemon and sugar 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.790
 let's fill it more or less by the 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.940
 half of the bark 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.820
 and we are going to try to make the layer 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.869
 uniform and let's fill in the rest with 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.869
 the lemon slurry 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.739
 then we will cover it and wash the 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.840
 tapita that brought the bark so that 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.360
 is the one that I'm going to use to cover it and what 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.600
 we will put in the refrigerator for about two 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:34.940
 or three hours or so 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.940
 at 23 o'clock we will take it out 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.090
 and we are going to put all the 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:42.090
 circumferences with him 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:50.100
 and so we have a super lemon pie 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.100
 easy and super delicious
