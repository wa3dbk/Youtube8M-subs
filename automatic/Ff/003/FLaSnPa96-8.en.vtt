 minecraft a launcher for all 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.790
 versions because I was asked by a friend 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.790
 mine a subscriber 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:33.470
 and good let's start 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.430
 I'm going to leave this link with the 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.190
 description 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.720
 and I'll put the description 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.200
 [Music] 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.200
 launcher 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:49.020
 once there is a copy of the link it hits 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.770
 they seek as well as active 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.770
 I took care of 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.150
 you wait 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.150
 because everything 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.110
 why 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.600
 and here they ask you 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.500
 [Music] 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.500
 and save it 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.760
 I will keep it 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.760
 in a folder 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.409
 here 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.430
 [Music] 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.999
 [Music] 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.600
 and they give him there 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.600
 I will show in folders 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.890
 already in the folder 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.539
 and they give you right click 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.539
 [Music] 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.810
 yes 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:21.020
 [Music] 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.510
 good there 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.770
 they should work this very fast too 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.929
 we could 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.929
 [Music] 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.710
 [Music] 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.090
 and now here is the lake 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.090
 Now I 'm going to show you 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.970
 it works and everything 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.250
 and that is going to open 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:05.900
 from all the versions while each 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:10.430
 new version go out 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:12.500
 and the launcher is updated but 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.970
 obviously they have to have ready I have not 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.280
 connected all the time so that it 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:20.500
 go updating little by little 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.500
 well that opens 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:29.180
 well fine as you can see here already what 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.310
 have when it opens 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.900
 you here put your username 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.390
 for example they can put any 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:39.100
 first name 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.100
 for example mine is 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.010
 and with my YouTube account the last 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.780
 all right 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.959
 here is optimal study because it is a 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.959
 time 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.710
 but yes 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:57.930
 why 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.930
 change the configuration of your minecraft 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.239
 but about it matters 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.260
 who puts his version of version 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:19.690
 and look for the version you need 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:21.470
 1.0 for now but do it 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.800
 that I think the greatest 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:28.920
 good 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.920
 [Music] 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:36.930
 as you can see 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:38.789
 how are you seeing here if it works well 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:42.740
 as you can see that they played us, they give 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:42.740
 a player what do I know 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:49.289
 his rival 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:52.129
 to show them 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:52.129
 to load 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.500
 if they hear a kitten meowing is my 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.500
 kitten 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.530
 we wait for him to load 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:10.520
 Oh no 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.520
 Well, I'm going to walk a little 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:16.360
 not so much but a little 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:16.360
 work 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:22.330
 good but as you can see it does not load very well 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.100
 the ground because I'm recording with 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.330
 qantas already 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:29.610
 I'm recording on a notebook 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:32.040
 I think I would not have as much capacity as 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.200
 to support 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.100
 while I'm recording and showing you 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.190
 this 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:40.070
 well as you see it is 100% functional 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.750
 functions and everything 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.790
 you know excuse me if it goes a little 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:48.729
 slow as you can see 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:52.830
 15 fps that 's a potato 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:52.830
 parkour in the trees shit 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:59.029
 but high and see because I'm 

00:05:56.059 --> 00:06:00.709

00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:03.709

00:06:00.709 --> 00:06:06.169
