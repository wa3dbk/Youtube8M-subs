00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
which we're not gonna be using but it's

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.779 
which we're not gonna be using but it's
always<00:00:22.529> good<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.710> have<00:00:22.830> that<00:00:22.980> as<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.160> backup<00:00:23.430> in

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
always good to have that as a backup in

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.790 
always good to have that as a backup in
case<00:00:23.820> your<00:00:24.119> graphics<00:00:24.480> card<00:00:24.689> craps<00:00:24.960> out<00:00:25.170> and

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
case your graphics card craps out and

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.560 
case your graphics card craps out and
you're<00:00:26.039> gonna<00:00:26.130> have<00:00:26.279> some<00:00:26.430> really<00:00:26.640> good

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
you're gonna have some really good

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.330 
you're gonna have some really good
upgrade<00:00:27.990> ability<00:00:28.109> options<00:00:28.680> with<00:00:28.830> this<00:00:28.980> if<00:00:29.160> you

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
upgrade ability options with this if you

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.429 
upgrade ability options with this if you
do<00:00:29.699> find<00:00:29.910> limiting<00:00:30.390> by<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.750> dual-core<00:00:31.050> which

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
do find limiting by the dual-core which

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.139 
do find limiting by the dual-core which
isn't<00:00:31.650> even<00:00:31.859> really<00:00:32.130> that<00:00:32.250> bad<00:00:32.489> most<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.090> the

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
isn't even really that bad most of the

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.310 
isn't even really that bad most of the
latest<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.510> will<00:00:33.660> still<00:00:33.840> recommend<00:00:34.230> a

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
latest I will still recommend a

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.049 
latest I will still recommend a
dual-core<00:00:34.710> that's<00:00:35.280> just<00:00:35.460> really<00:00:35.730> high<00:00:35.880> in

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
dual-core that's just really high in

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.700 
dual-core that's just really high in
games<00:00:36.270> like<00:00:36.390> Metro<00:00:36.780> last<00:00:36.930> light<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.410> whatnot

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
games like Metro last light and whatnot

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.380 
games like Metro last light and whatnot
where<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.309> know<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.430> quad<00:00:38.820> core<00:00:39.030> would<00:00:39.210> be

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
where you know a quad core would be

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.330 
where you know a quad core would be
helpful<00:00:39.719> but<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.200> dual<00:00:40.379> core<00:00:40.620> can<00:00:40.860> still<00:00:41.190> you

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
helpful but a dual core can still you

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.650 
helpful but a dual core can still you
know<00:00:41.430> run<00:00:41.640> games<00:00:41.879> at<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.329> know<00:00:42.420> decent

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
know run games at you know decent

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.299 
know run games at you know decent
resolutions<00:00:43.230> decent<00:00:43.620> settings<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.040> most<00:00:44.190> of

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
resolutions decent settings and most of

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.279 
resolutions decent settings and most of
the<00:00:44.460> performance<00:00:45.149> lies<00:00:45.780> heavily<00:00:46.140> on<00:00:46.230> the

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
the performance lies heavily on the

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.299 
the performance lies heavily on the
graphics<00:00:46.649> card<00:00:46.680> so<00:00:46.860> you're<00:00:47.070> gonna<00:00:47.160> be

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
graphics card so you're gonna be

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.830 
graphics card so you're gonna be
absolutely<00:00:47.399> fine<00:00:47.789> with<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:48.090> dual<00:00:48.300> core<00:00:48.480> for<00:00:48.690> now

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
absolutely fine with a dual core for now

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.630 
absolutely fine with a dual core for now
but<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.530> do<00:00:49.620> have<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.950> option<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.460> upgrade

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
but you do have the option to upgrade

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.689 
but you do have the option to upgrade
down<00:00:51.149> low<00:00:51.270> onto<00:00:51.510> an<00:00:51.600> i5<00:00:51.899> i3<00:00:52.530> i3<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.399> dual<00:00:53.610> core

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
down low onto an i5 i3 i3 is a dual core

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.130 
down low onto an i5 i3 i3 is a dual core
but<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.059> has<00:00:54.149> hyper-threading<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:54.840> it's<00:00:54.960> kind

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
but it has hyper-threading so it's kind

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.170 
but it has hyper-threading so it's kind
of<00:00:55.170> like<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.350> quad<00:00:55.590> core<00:00:55.829> like<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.430> mock<00:00:56.760> quad

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
of like a quad core like a mock quad

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.410 
of like a quad core like a mock quad
core<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.660> say<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:58.559> say<00:00:58.739> um<00:00:59.100> okay<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.030> for<00:01:00.329> the

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
core to say to say um okay so for the

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.450 
core to say to say um okay so for the
motherboard<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:00.870> won<00:01:01.020> with<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.230> MSI<00:01:01.620> 861<00:01:02.190> m

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
motherboard I won with the MSI 861 m

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.759 
motherboard I won with the MSI 861 m
dash<00:01:02.730> P<00:01:02.940> 31<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.750> same<00:01:04.049> mother<00:01:04.229> but<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.439> won<00:01:04.619> with

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
dash P 31 the same mother but I won with

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.609 
dash P 31 the same mother but I won with
my<00:01:05.010> in<00:01:05.309> my<00:01:05.339> $300<00:01:06.270> build<00:01:06.540> um<00:01:06.780> it's<00:01:07.110> only<00:01:07.260> 48

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
my in my $300 build um it's only 48

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.020 
my in my $300 build um it's only 48
dollars<00:01:07.799> that's<00:01:08.100> really<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.430> main<00:01:08.640> reason<00:01:08.670> I

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
dollars that's really the main reason I

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.340 
dollars that's really the main reason I
won<00:01:09.180> for<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.450> doesn't<00:01:09.659> really<00:01:09.810> have<00:01:10.020> any<00:01:10.170> key

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
won for it doesn't really have any key

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.730 
won for it doesn't really have any key
features<00:01:11.030> but<00:01:12.030> it's<00:01:12.240> $48<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.560> does

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
features but it's $48 and it does

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.990 
features but it's $48 and it does
everything<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.250> wanted<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.790> nothing

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
everything you wanted to and nothing

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.570 
everything you wanted to and nothing
really<00:01:15.360> else<00:01:15.740> so<00:01:16.740> you're<00:01:17.100> gonna<00:01:17.220> be<00:01:17.369> able<00:01:17.460> to

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
really else so you're gonna be able to

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.300 
really else so you're gonna be able to
you<00:01:17.939> know<00:01:17.970> do<00:01:18.330> most<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.630> your<00:01:18.720> stuff<00:01:19.049> but<00:01:19.380> if

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
you know do most of your stuff but if

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.620 
you know do most of your stuff but if
you<00:01:20.460> want<00:01:20.640> something<00:01:20.850> better<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.270> can<00:01:21.420> shop

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
you want something better you can shop

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.690 
you want something better you can shop
around<00:01:21.780> but<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.740> really<00:01:22.979> recommend<00:01:23.340> this<00:01:23.400> since

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
around but I really recommend this since

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.370

it's cheap and that's what you really
want<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.479> budget<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.320> build<00:01:28.530> like<00:01:28.740> this

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
want and budget and build like this

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.090 
want and budget and build like this
alright<00:01:29.640> for<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.880> RAM<00:01:30.030> well<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.720> get<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.530> 2

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
alright for the RAM well to get to 2

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.069 
alright for the RAM well to get to 2
gigabytes<00:01:32.280> sticks<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:33.000> g.skill<00:01:33.450> it's<00:01:33.720> for<00:01:33.960> you

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
gigabytes sticks of g.skill it's for you

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.649 
gigabytes sticks of g.skill it's for you
but<00:01:34.290> stolen<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:34.829> runs<00:01:35.070> at<00:01:35.189> 1333<00:01:35.939> speed<00:01:36.210> that's

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
but stolen and runs at 1333 speed that's

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.660 
but stolen and runs at 1333 speed that's
about<00:01:36.840> $35<00:01:37.530> really<00:01:37.770> good<00:01:37.890> deal<00:01:38.100> there<00:01:38.400> since

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
about $35 really good deal there since

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.300 
about $35 really good deal there since
uh<00:01:38.759> 8<00:01:39.119> gigs<00:01:39.420> is<00:01:39.630> around<00:01:39.930> $70<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:41.220> know

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
uh 8 gigs is around $70 so you know

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.370 
uh 8 gigs is around $70 so you know
kinda<00:01:41.670> like<00:01:41.700> proportional<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.509> forty<00:01:43.049> ace<00:01:43.170> is

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
kinda like proportional and forty ace is

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.710 
kinda like proportional and forty ace is
still<00:01:43.560> gonna<00:01:43.680> be<00:01:44.250> fine<00:01:44.790> for<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.270> mean<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.570> lot

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
still gonna be fine for you I mean a lot

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.330 
still gonna be fine for you I mean a lot
of<00:01:45.750> games<00:01:45.960> don't<00:01:46.170> even<00:01:46.350> recommend<00:01:46.619> 8<00:01:46.950> gigs<00:01:47.189> and

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
of games don't even recommend 8 gigs and

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.069 
of games don't even recommend 8 gigs and
this<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.579> mainly<00:01:47.850> gaming<00:01:48.329> centric<00:01:48.689> and<00:01:48.869> not

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
this is mainly gaming centric and not

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.440 
this is mainly gaming centric and not
meant<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:49.979> be<00:01:50.070> used<00:01:50.310> for<00:01:50.430> video<00:01:50.640> editing<00:01:50.909> even

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
meant to be used for video editing even

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.179 
meant to be used for video editing even
if<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:51.659> even<00:01:51.960> though<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.380> can<00:01:52.710> do<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.920> little

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
if you even though you can do a little

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.100 
if you even though you can do a little
bit<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.399> that<00:01:53.490> so<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:54.240> have<00:01:54.329> some<00:01:54.479> options<00:01:54.509> um

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
bit of that so you have some options um

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.260 
bit of that so you have some options um
alright<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.219> for<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.490> past<00:01:56.670> 11<00:01:56.969> with<00:01:57.149> the

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
alright so for the past 11 with the

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.719 
alright so for the past 11 with the
corsair<00:01:57.659> CX<00:01:57.990> 430<00:01:58.469> m<00:01:58.680> now<00:01:59.280> would<00:01:59.430> have<00:01:59.490> just

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
corsair CX 430 m now would have just

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.850 
corsair CX 430 m now would have just
gone<00:01:59.820> with<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.060> regular<00:02:00.390> CX<00:02:00.719> 430<00:02:01.140> but<00:02:01.380> it's

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
gone with the regular CX 430 but it's

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.980 
gone with the regular CX 430 but it's
actually<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.460> 430<00:02:03.000> m<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.420> actually<00:02:03.750> cheaper

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
actually the 430 m is actually cheaper

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.410 
actually the 430 m is actually cheaper
than<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.500> 430<00:02:04.950> what<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.520> 430<00:02:05.909> m<00:02:06.090> is<00:02:06.270> it's

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
than the 430 what the 430 m is it's

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.779 
than the 430 what the 430 m is it's
basically<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:07.439> same<00:02:07.590> thing<00:02:07.649> as<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.069> CX<00:02:08.340> 430

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
basically the same thing as the CX 430

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.760 
basically the same thing as the CX 430
but<00:02:08.970> it's<00:02:09.090> modular<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:09.869> I<00:02:10.050> mean<00:02:10.500> you're

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
but it's modular so I mean you're

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.410 
but it's modular so I mean you're
basically<00:02:10.890> playing<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.580> pain<00:02:11.819> cheaper<00:02:12.209> for<00:02:12.390> a

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
basically playing a pain cheaper for a

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.339 
basically playing a pain cheaper for a
modular<00:02:12.810> power<00:02:12.989> supply

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
modular power supply

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:13.910 
modular power supply
opposed

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
opposed

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.949 
opposed
regular<00:02:14.310> power<00:02:14.520> supply<00:02:14.760> so<00:02:15.000> figured<00:02:15.750> why<00:02:15.900> the

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
regular power supply so figured why the

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.970 
regular power supply so figured why the
hell<00:02:16.170> not<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:18.090> six<00:02:18.540> for<00:02:18.720> 30<00:02:18.930> amis<00:02:19.290> $50<00:02:19.800> and<00:02:19.920> the

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
hell not the six for 30 amis $50 and the

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.160 
hell not the six for 30 amis $50 and the
sets<00:02:20.250> for<00:02:20.430> 30<00:02:20.730> is<00:02:20.849> $50<00:02:21.330> but<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.569> for<00:02:21.750> 30<00:02:21.959> amp

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
sets for 30 is $50 but the for 30 amp

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.040 
sets for 30 is $50 but the for 30 amp
has<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.349> $10<00:02:22.739> million<00:02:22.980> rebate<00:02:23.250> so<00:02:23.930> really<00:02:24.930> is

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
has a $10 million rebate so really is

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.570 
has a $10 million rebate so really is
only<00:02:25.200> $40<00:02:25.770> and<00:02:25.890> this<00:02:26.069> is<00:02:26.130> gonna<00:02:26.220> be<00:02:26.400> able<00:02:26.489> to

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
only $40 and this is gonna be able to

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.220 
only $40 and this is gonna be able to
run<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.880> build<00:02:27.120> no<00:02:27.420> problem<00:02:27.840> I<00:02:27.959> mean<00:02:28.110> the

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
run the build no problem I mean the

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.930 
run the build no problem I mean the
build<00:02:28.410> probably<00:02:28.739> at<00:02:28.860> full<00:02:29.099> load<00:02:29.310> only<00:02:29.670> uses

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
build probably at full load only uses

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.380 
build probably at full load only uses
320<00:02:30.810> 330<00:02:31.319> watts<00:02:31.739> so<00:02:31.950> maybe<00:02:32.670> absolutely<00:02:33.150> fine

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
320 330 watts so maybe absolutely fine

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.270 
320 330 watts so maybe absolutely fine
with<00:02:33.420> a<00:02:33.630> 6-4<00:02:34.080> 30<00:02:34.350> if<00:02:34.830> you<00:02:34.950> want<00:02:35.100> something

with a 6-4 30 if you want something

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.010 
with a 6-4 30 if you want something
better<00:02:35.430> you<00:02:35.640> can<00:02:35.790> get<00:02:35.940> a<00:02:35.970> 6<00:02:36.209> 500<00:02:36.720> but<00:02:36.870> you

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
better you can get a 6 500 but you

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.840 
better you can get a 6 500 but you
really<00:02:37.290> don't<00:02:37.650> need<00:02:37.920> it<00:02:37.980> alright<00:02:38.640> for<00:02:38.670> the

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
gaming you're not gonna be able to run

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.289 
gaming you're not gonna be able to run
every<00:03:07.650> game<00:03:07.890> at<00:03:08.069> you<00:03:08.250> know<00:03:08.340> highest<00:03:08.910> settings

every game at you know highest settings

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.449 
every game at you know highest settings
highest<00:03:09.630> resolution<00:03:09.930> but<00:03:10.650> it<00:03:10.860> is<00:03:11.010> really<00:03:11.220> good

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459

for budget and gaming and its really

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.759 
for budget and gaming and its really
fast

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
fast

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.580 
fast
also<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:14.880> XFX<00:03:15.330> cluing<00:03:15.780> will<00:03:16.230> give<00:03:16.410> you<00:03:16.500> an

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
also the XFX cluing will give you an

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.740 
also the XFX cluing will give you an
option<00:03:16.739> of<00:03:17.340> overclocking<00:03:17.850> so<00:03:18.269> if<00:03:18.329> you<00:03:18.420> do<00:03:18.570> want

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
option of overclocking so if you do want

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.840 
option of overclocking so if you do want
to<00:03:18.810> do<00:03:18.930> that<00:03:19.079> that<00:03:19.799> is<00:03:19.829> an<00:03:20.070> option<00:03:20.220> but<00:03:20.640> you

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
to do that that is an option but you

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.460 
to do that that is an option but you
don't<00:03:21.030> have<00:03:21.180> to<00:03:21.390> and<00:03:21.630> this<00:03:22.019> is<00:03:22.109> gonna<00:03:22.230> be<00:03:22.290> able

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
don't have to and this is gonna be able

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.259 
don't have to and this is gonna be able
to<00:03:22.530> run<00:03:22.680> games<00:03:22.829> really<00:03:23.370> well<00:03:23.609> way<00:03:23.940> better<00:03:24.150> than

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
to run games really well way better than

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.270 
to run games really well way better than
consoles<00:03:24.840> so<00:03:25.079> that's<00:03:25.709> basically<00:03:25.980> what<00:03:26.160> you

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
consoles so that's basically what you

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.099 
consoles so that's basically what you
want<00:03:26.459> to<00:03:26.519> try<00:03:26.609> to<00:03:26.700> do<00:03:26.880> at<00:03:27.180> $400<00:03:27.840> you<00:03:27.900> want<00:03:28.049> to

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
want to try to do at $400 you want to

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:29.360 
want to try to do at $400 you want to
get<00:03:28.200> something<00:03:28.410> that's<00:03:28.530> better<00:03:28.859> than<00:03:29.040> console

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
get something that's better than console

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.490 
get something that's better than console
since<00:03:29.549> it<00:03:29.760> is<00:03:30.030> basically<00:03:30.570> you<00:03:30.959> know<00:03:31.049> just<00:03:31.079> a

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
since it is basically you know just a

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.229 
since it is basically you know just a
little<00:03:31.799> bit<00:03:32.010> more<00:03:32.190> expensive<00:03:32.430> than<00:03:32.730> a<00:03:32.760> console

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
little bit more expensive than a console

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.270 
little bit more expensive than a console
but<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:33.930> case<00:03:34.079> I<00:03:34.290> went<00:03:34.500> with<00:03:34.590> dog<00:03:34.829> shit<00:03:35.130> and

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
but the case I went with dog shit and

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.509 
but the case I went with dog shit and
now<00:03:35.519> it's<00:03:35.790> the<00:03:35.940> apex<00:03:36.359> PC<00:03:36.930> -<00:03:37.320> 3<00:03:37.680> 8<00:03:37.859> 9<00:03:37.890> it's<00:03:38.400> a

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
now it's the apex PC - 3 8 9 it's a

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.580 
now it's the apex PC - 3 8 9 it's a
black<00:03:38.700> steel<00:03:38.940> ATX<00:03:39.359> mid<00:03:39.540> tower<00:03:39.570> case<00:03:39.780> it's<00:03:40.500> an

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
black steel ATX mid tower case it's an

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.620 
black steel ATX mid tower case it's an
absolutely<00:03:41.100> garbage<00:03:41.670> case<00:03:41.910> but<00:03:42.150> I<00:03:42.180> wanted<00:03:42.540> to

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
absolutely garbage case but I wanted to

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:43.819 
absolutely garbage case but I wanted to
go<00:03:42.780> with<00:03:42.930> it<00:03:43.049> so<00:03:43.170> I<00:03:43.200> could<00:03:43.350> put<00:03:43.500> more<00:03:43.650> money

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
go with it so I could put more money

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:46.130 
go with it so I could put more money
into<00:03:44.040> the<00:03:44.190> graphics<00:03:44.609> card<00:03:44.880> if<00:03:45.840> you<00:03:46.019> want

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
into the graphics card if you want

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.509 
into the graphics card if you want
something<00:03:46.380> better<00:03:46.620> and<00:03:46.829> you<00:03:46.890> can<00:03:47.040> spare<00:03:47.220> 20

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
something better and you can spare 20

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.729 
something better and you can spare 20
