00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:11.639 
tight seal by pressure heat and pressure

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:13.699 
tight seal by pressure heat and pressure
that's<00:03:12.000> how<00:03:12.120> these<00:03:12.299> adhesive<00:03:13.230> wraps<00:03:13.439> are

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
that's how these adhesive wraps are

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.830 
that's how these adhesive wraps are
activated<00:03:14.430> this<00:03:14.819> is<00:03:14.939> the<00:03:15.120> best<00:03:15.420> way<00:03:15.599> to<00:03:15.659> get

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
activated this is the best way to get

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.140 
activated this is the best way to get
any<00:03:16.079> little<00:03:16.769> bubbles<00:03:17.310> out<00:03:17.400> on<00:03:17.549> the<00:03:17.639> sides<00:03:17.879> that

you might have anything in the center

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.839 
you might have anything in the center
towards<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.120> cuticle<00:03:21.540> just<00:03:21.720> press

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:22.849 
towards the cuticle just press

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:28.220 
towards the cuticle just press
everything<00:03:24.410> and<00:03:25.579> okay<00:03:26.579> so<00:03:26.639> now<00:03:27.000> she<00:03:27.060> has<00:03:27.690> no

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230

wrinkles no bubbles nothing like that

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.220 
wrinkles no bubbles nothing like that
and<00:03:32.060> she<00:03:33.060> was<00:03:33.150> gonna<00:03:33.239> do<00:03:33.449> the<00:03:33.569> next<00:03:33.720> step<00:03:33.870> which

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
and she was gonna do the next step which

her finger in this plastic bag like I'm
trying<00:03:40.680> to<00:03:40.799> poke<00:03:40.980> through<00:03:41.010> it<00:03:41.400> so<00:03:41.579> it<00:03:41.669> wraps

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
trying to poke through it so it wraps

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:43.490 
trying to poke through it so it wraps
all<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.090> way<00:03:42.209> around<00:03:42.269> fine<00:03:42.810> as<00:03:43.049> you<00:03:43.139> can<00:03:43.290> see

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
all the way around fine as you can see

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.439 
all the way around fine as you can see
it<00:03:43.620> pulls<00:03:43.889> the<00:03:44.280> nail<00:03:44.430> wrap<00:03:44.669> down<00:03:44.970> around<00:03:45.239> her

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
finger and that's going to help seal the

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.860 
finger and that's going to help seal the
nail<00:03:48.959> wrap<00:03:49.229> to<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.620> tip<00:03:49.889> of<00:03:49.919> your<00:03:50.069> finger<00:03:50.870> so

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
after she's heated it you're going to

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.009 
after she's heated it you're going to
see<00:03:55.739> there's<00:03:55.919> a<00:03:56.069> ton<00:03:56.370> of<00:03:56.400> extra<00:03:57.090> hanging<00:03:57.750> over

see there's a ton of extra hanging over

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.330 
see there's a ton of extra hanging over
the<00:03:58.109> nail<00:03:58.319> and<00:03:58.620> that's<00:03:58.799> okay<00:03:59.099> because<00:03:59.159> we're

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
the nail and that's okay because we're

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.550 
the nail and that's okay because we're
going<00:03:59.459> to<00:03:59.519> file<00:03:59.729> that<00:03:59.760> off<00:04:00.120> now<00:04:00.750> the<00:04:00.810> and<00:04:01.500> the

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
going to file that off now the and the

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.890 
going to file that off now the and the
next<00:04:01.829> key<00:04:02.129> is<00:04:02.340> to<00:04:02.609> not<00:04:02.819> touch<00:04:03.329> the<00:04:03.599> tip<00:04:03.750> of<00:04:03.840> your

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
next key is to not touch the tip of your

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.479 
next key is to not touch the tip of your
nail<00:04:04.079> by<00:04:04.229> filing<00:04:04.709> or<00:04:04.829> clipping<00:04:05.129> or<00:04:05.220> anything

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
nail by filing or clipping or anything

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.420 
nail by filing or clipping or anything
until<00:04:05.699> your<00:04:05.790> nails<00:04:05.970> are<00:04:06.090> completely<00:04:07.049> cold<00:04:07.889> so

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
until your nails are completely cold so

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.800 
until your nails are completely cold so
usually<00:04:08.609> I<00:04:08.819> go<00:04:09.030> through<00:04:09.180> this<00:04:09.269> entire<00:04:09.540> process

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
usually I go through this entire process

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.270 
usually I go through this entire process
and<00:04:10.139> then<00:04:10.229> I<00:04:10.319> file<00:04:10.530> at<00:04:10.709> the<00:04:10.739> very<00:04:10.979> end<00:04:11.129> after

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
and then I file at the very end after

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.059 
and then I file at the very end after
all<00:04:11.579> of<00:04:11.879> my<00:04:12.030> nails<00:04:12.239> are<00:04:12.389> done<00:04:12.540> so<00:04:13.229> because<00:04:13.769> this

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
all of my nails are done so because this

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.670 
all of my nails are done so because this
is<00:04:14.190> a<00:04:14.250> video<00:04:14.519> we're<00:04:15.169> gonna<00:04:16.169> not<00:04:16.409> take<00:04:16.530> your

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
is a video we're gonna not take your

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.759 
is a video we're gonna not take your
advice<00:04:17.449> so<00:04:18.449> she's<00:04:18.630> going<00:04:18.840> to<00:04:18.900> file<00:04:19.109> downward

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
advice so she's going to file downward

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.339 
advice so she's going to file downward
at<00:04:20.039> a<00:04:20.099> 90<00:04:20.549> degree<00:04:20.579> angle<00:04:20.849> to<00:04:21.239> get<00:04:21.630> that<00:04:21.779> excess

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
at a 90 degree angle to get that excess

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:25.010 
at a 90 degree angle to get that excess
nail<00:04:22.680> wrap<00:04:22.950> off<00:04:23.300> don't<00:04:24.300> file<00:04:24.510> too<00:04:24.779> hard

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
nail wrap off don't file too hard

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.330 
nail wrap off don't file too hard
because<00:04:25.139> you<00:04:25.349> can<00:04:25.740> rip

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
because you can rip

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.460 
because you can rip
the<00:04:26.460> edges<00:04:26.940> of<00:04:27.150> your<00:04:27.180> nail<00:04:27.780> wrap<00:04:27.990> that<00:04:28.290> can

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
the edges of your nail wrap that can

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.530 
the edges of your nail wrap that can
cause<00:04:28.650> it<00:04:28.800> to<00:04:28.830> lift<00:04:29.130> just<00:04:30.030> add<00:04:30.240> enough

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
cause it to lift just add enough

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.180 
cause it to lift just add enough
pressure<00:04:30.810> so<00:04:31.199> that<00:04:31.320> you're<00:04:31.530> getting<00:04:32.040> it<00:04:32.130> off

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
pressure so that you're getting it off

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.100 
pressure so that you're getting it off
this<00:04:32.310> might<00:04:32.490> take<00:04:32.610> a<00:04:32.669> little<00:04:32.820> bit<00:04:32.940> but<00:04:33.930> have

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
this might take a little bit but have

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.420 
this might take a little bit but have
patience<00:04:34.560> and<00:04:34.740> always<00:04:34.949> make<00:04:35.070> sure<00:04:35.130> it's<00:04:35.340> at<00:04:35.400> a

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
patience and always make sure it's at a

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.219 
patience and always make sure it's at a
90-degree<00:04:36.000> angle<00:04:36.030> and<00:04:36.419> you're<00:04:36.510> pulling<00:04:36.840> down

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229 
90-degree angle and you're pulling down

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:40.129 
90-degree angle and you're pulling down
