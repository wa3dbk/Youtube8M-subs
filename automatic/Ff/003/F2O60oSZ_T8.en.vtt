00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.490
 again we talked about the 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.439
 water retention since heat 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.150
 arrive and that a lot of people 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:20.270
 especially many women have 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.449
 tendency to water retention 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.350
 precisely because of the heat so the 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.260
 advice that I can give you 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.650
 today it is at the water level 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.230
 so do not believe that if you 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.750
 drink can you do less retention 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.320
 of water on the contrary since the little water 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.880
 that you drink is going to be stored since 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.520
 you did not bring enough to your 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.780
 organism so precisely we must drink 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.550
 more for you to eliminate 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.680
 enough so it's very important 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.860
 there are people who drink a lot 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.750
 water and that eliminates very well others 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.180
 who do not drink much and who can 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.469
 well inflated so unless you have 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.840
 obviously a health problem 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.109
 particular you have to pay attention to 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.520
 your water intake but in the case 

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:09.810
 contrary I obviously advise you 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.850
 to drink enough 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.340
 so to see enough enough 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.099
 check that your urine in the day 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.590
 be transparent if they are colored 

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:22.139
 is that they are concentrated and therefore 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.119
 it's that you do not drink enough 

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:26.310
 that I say for a long time to my 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.740
 patients water is very important 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.200
 even when you want to lose weight if 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.299
 you play sports but you drink 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.340
 not if you go on a diet but that 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.359
 you do not drink everything will stay stuck in 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.219
 done in the tissues and you 

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:40.079
 would not eliminate properly so you 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:41.719
 will not have results for the 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.119
 water retention it's the same thing 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:48.539
 the more we drink and the more we eliminate 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.609
 so this first point does I you 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.609
 also spoke at the sport level 

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:58.200
 you have to know that sport, especially 

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:59.590
 walks swimming kind aqua gym or 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.600
 to do lengths 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:06.729
 if it helps to avoid retention 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.069
 of water then walking simply 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.800
 because when we walk we activate the 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:14.920
 pump that binds to below the foot and 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.099
 which promotes venous return so the 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.470
 return of the blood to the heart and so that 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:23.110
 prevents water from actually accumulating 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.540
 down people and so we have the ankles 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.269
 or the feet that makes it so it's for 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.010
 that walking is very important and 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:33.209
 swimming or anything that is activities 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:36.870
 in the water it's also important for a 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:39.970
 osmosis phenomenon that is to say that 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.000
 balou I do not know how 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.670
 explain it in fact it's okay 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.200
 to eliminate the water we have in the body 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.910
 since we are surrounded by water, here I am 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.970
 do not know how to explain it 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:55.750
 but it's a phenomenon of osmosis 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:58.569
 just allow it so for this it would take 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.640
 actually do sports so twice 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.459
 per week and the sessions should 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.769
 it should be 45 minutes 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.900
 so come back to have an effect 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.480
 positive 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:13.720
 then to help you you can 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.180
 also take plants so under 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.849
 form of capsules or put in water 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.639
 of your day then the plants that 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:25.420
 are known precisely to stimulate the 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:26.079
 liver or meyrin and or strengthen the 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.150
 blood vessels 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:30.970
 so they are known to fight 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:34.690
 water retention what are the ash is 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.130
 the piloselle green tea vine red gold 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.989
 tosi funds and dandelion 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.480
 these are really the plants the 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.769
 most known to help you fight 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.209
 against water retention there are some 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:45.069
 maybe others that I do not know 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.579
 so do not hesitate to put in 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.579
 comment 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:50.829
 if you ever know others in 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:53.560
 any case these are well known and 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:56.109
 reputed to help eliminate 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.810
 water and at the level of the vessels 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:00.579
 blood we know how to strengthen them 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.200
 for this week so I find you 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:04.419
 next week I would give you 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.010
 more tips on others 

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:08.110
 foods that you can prioritize 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.890
 to fight against water retention 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.890
 after
