00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 Hello viewers and followers of my 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:08.400
 channel in this video I want to do 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:11.309
 review on my new canon ixus 135 camera 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.340
 so let's start well, let's see 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.640
 someone a gun closer I think so what have u 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:21.710
 we have here well firstly it 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:26.220
 shooting subtracting about rolling to wifi 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:28.529
 the inscription ixus then 16 megapixels 8 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:33.300
 28 millimeters multiple zoom lens 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:37.110
 How much and understand the screen diagonal 6 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:41.780
 8 centimeters for up to 7 so we have here 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:44.579
 there is also told about 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.950
 dangerous boredom hugged image 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.649
 conditionally actually written black 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.800
 so let's open naturally I already 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.590
 opened this box 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:59.820
 because the guy is somewhere on the third day 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.789
 probably so the way I bought and 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.990
 addition here is a card 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:10.710
 think'st for 16 gigabytes i.e. removes 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:16.619
 almost the video we insert I will see also 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:20.280
 How much time will be a review on the case so 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:24.680
 remember it belongs there everywhere 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.680
 computer cable 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:31.970
 will be 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:35.070
 postpone then this bag lay there 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:38.210
 something else I can not remember here we 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:43.799
 quick start guide i could camera 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:47.909
 on disk and printed but not printed 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:51.329
 I will print I think there is nothing here 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:57.299
 and actually summer cottage in the summer I wonder 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:58.619
 I think it's charging cable for 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.400
 connecting detective 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:05.750
 This is itself a branch 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:10.490
 it is desirable to look at it like this 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.920
 It looks like we will postpone for a quick moment. 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:19.370
 we like and actually Santa will show 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:22.310
 in such a convenient baggies and more 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:26.750
 there is a pair of bag for reinforcement 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:31.810
 can so let me pay for it all now 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:35.060
 further and actually see myself so 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:38.480
 that's how it looks stylish design i 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.640
 tell you here you go here from the bottom 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:45.850
 parts and here it is here itself 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:50.030
 the battery itself is here a card slot 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:53.590
 here's the actual battery itself at 680 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:58.070
 milliamps as it happens 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:02.959
 you just insert that now like this 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:05.600
 here you connect the cable here this thing 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.709
 over here this outlet and your own 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.470
 everything is charging 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:15.320
 close everything so let 's see 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:19.220
 the camera itself and the diamond lens is written 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:24.620
 8x zoom inscription canon ixus 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:25.900
 the dumplings gave them the inclusion of rolling and neither 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.820
 wifi 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:32.780
 the button itself for photographing 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:35.060
 this is a little ring zoom speaker under 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.260
 panorama or automatic 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:42.610
 video recording let's see photos of the menu 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:46.640
 macro flash display without a camera 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:49.459
 134 grams and a basin and batteries from a card 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:53.540
 there so on my microphone here 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:54.410
 here is a video recording in moss 30 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:04:00.080
 frames per second 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:04.600
 let's turn off the percent such sound 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.600
 here actually so here 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:16.299
 so here it all looks the most push 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:18.880
 on an empty majulu by the way on if we 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.890
 click here then I'll go for the record 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.710
 video 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:27.640
 food is 12 that is and we can do it ourselves 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:30.790
 shoot and like that now I shoot myself 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:35.460
 you can also zoom 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:39.850
 now click here and so on 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:43.000
 button and perceived film can also 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:49.360
 make the volume pitch away too by pressing 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:51.010
 This button here is the author himself. 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.140
 about pretty good 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.510
 let's show you in the legs and go by 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:05:00.370
 his legs are so removed now but somehow 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:05.350
 strange of course but as was the case so 1 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:06.850
 photo 2 photo continues but 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.830
 than she will not show it now 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.610
 all because it's so clear i think 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:15.360
 we have a timer here 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:19.390
 photo resolution code format 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:22.540
 the actual video quality is 1280 by 720 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:24.760
 It means 720 and removes but as it was on in 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:29.290
 general here and so the camera is very 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:31.650
 good and I will shoot now on him 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:34.810
 all my videos now i'm shooting on 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:40.380
 let's check the tablet cleanly 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:40.380
 flash quality I will turn off the light now 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:46.169
 so here so let's take pictures 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:55.090

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:58.330

00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:00.010
