00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
my cousin for me sort of said the the

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.630 
my cousin for me sort of said the the
career<00:02:46.780> change<00:02:46.990> to<00:02:47.050> PT<00:02:47.530> has<00:02:47.800> thrown<00:02:48.040> in<00:02:48.250> a<00:02:48.430> zone

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
career change to PT has thrown in a zone

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.210 
career change to PT has thrown in a zone
and<00:02:49.450> that's<00:02:49.780> probably<00:02:49.990> make<00:02:50.320> me<00:02:50.560> more

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
and that's probably make me more

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.340 
and that's probably make me more
physique<00:02:51.670> conscious<00:02:52.240> and<00:02:52.810> it's<00:02:52.990> maybe<00:02:53.230> like

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
physique conscious and it's maybe like

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.490 
physique conscious and it's maybe like
perhaps<00:02:54.090> set<00:02:55.090> my<00:02:55.270> goals<00:02:55.510> thrown<00:02:55.870> over<00:02:56.350> away

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
perhaps set my goals thrown over away

every time I think that's probably dead

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.120 
every time I think that's probably dead
