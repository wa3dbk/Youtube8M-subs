00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:18.120 

you

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.130 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.650 

the<00:00:18.580> next<00:00:18.820> trick<00:00:18.940> I'm<00:00:19.060> showing<00:00:19.300> you<00:00:19.360> is

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:19.660 
the next trick I'm showing you is

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.660 
the next trick I'm showing you is
another<00:00:20.110> type<00:00:20.410> of<00:00:20.439> throw<00:00:20.800> which<00:00:21.130> is<00:00:21.160> the<00:00:21.430> brain

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:21.670 
another type of throw which is the brain

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.000 
another type of throw which is the brain
twister<00:00:21.789> throw<00:00:22.300> and<00:00:22.539> like<00:00:23.289> in<00:00:23.439> Singler<00:00:23.770> there

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.010 
twister throw and like in Singler there

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.710 
twister throw and like in Singler there
are<00:00:24.099> two<00:00:24.279> ways<00:00:24.550> to<00:00:24.880> get<00:00:25.210> to<00:00:25.360> the<00:00:25.449> brain<00:00:25.599> twister

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
are two ways to get to the brain twister

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.800 
are two ways to get to the brain twister
mount<00:00:25.960> there's<00:00:26.680> the<00:00:26.830> undermount<00:00:27.250> which<00:00:27.610> is

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
mount there's the undermount which is

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.300 
mount there's the undermount which is
most<00:00:28.810> people<00:00:28.900> would<00:00:29.080> say<00:00:29.169> easier<00:00:29.590> when<00:00:30.160> you're

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310 
most people would say easier when you're

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.280 
most people would say easier when you're
just<00:00:30.430> laying<00:00:30.669> in<00:00:30.849> the<00:00:31.539> string<00:00:31.779> under<00:00:32.110> and

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
just laying in the string under and

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.460 
just laying in the string under and
letting<00:00:32.650> your<00:00:32.739> other<00:00:32.920> hand<00:00:33.160> use<00:00:33.280> motion<00:00:33.670> and

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
letting your other hand use motion and

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.560 
letting your other hand use motion and
the<00:00:35.470> other<00:00:35.620> mount<00:00:36.430> or<00:00:36.940> the<00:00:37.090> other<00:00:37.239> way<00:00:37.420> of

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
the other mount or the other way of

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.780 
the other mount or the other way of
doing<00:00:37.720> it<00:00:37.930> is<00:00:38.410> that<00:00:38.590> over<00:00:38.920> and<00:00:39.220> which<00:00:39.580> you<00:00:39.670> let

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
doing it is that over and which you let

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.780 
doing it is that over and which you let
your<00:00:39.940> left<00:00:40.120> hand<00:00:40.239> do<00:00:40.449> it<00:00:40.600> like<00:00:41.410> that<00:00:41.620> and<00:00:42.100> yeah

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
your left hand do it like that and yeah

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:43.979 
your left hand do it like that and yeah
I<00:00:42.820> probably<00:00:43.059> say<00:00:43.300> that<00:00:43.420> much<00:00:43.540> harder<00:00:43.839> but

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
I probably say that much harder but

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.140 
I probably say that much harder but
they're<00:00:44.110> both<00:00:44.320> the<00:00:45.190> same<00:00:45.220> way<00:00:45.640> to<00:00:45.699> get<00:00:45.970> into

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.150 
they're both the same way to get into

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.689 
they're both the same way to get into
the<00:00:46.300> brain<00:00:46.600> system<00:00:46.960> oust<00:00:47.400> to<00:00:48.400> do<00:00:48.519> that

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
the brain system oust to do that

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:50.729 
the brain system oust to do that
underhand<00:00:49.089> mount<00:00:49.300> what<00:00:49.570> you<00:00:49.690> want<00:00:49.809> to<00:00:49.900> do<00:00:50.019> is

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
underhand mount what you want to do is

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:53.279 
underhand mount what you want to do is
hold<00:00:51.100> your<00:00:51.340> non-throw<00:00:51.610> hand<00:00:51.930> kind<00:00:52.930> of<00:00:53.020> open

00:00:53.279 --> 00:00:53.289 
hold your non-throw hand kind of open

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:54.660 
hold your non-throw hand kind of open
with<00:00:53.590> your<00:00:53.680> palm<00:00:53.890> and<00:00:53.920> you're<00:00:54.219> going<00:00:54.340> to<00:00:54.399> throw

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
with your palm and you're going to throw

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.240 
with your palm and you're going to throw
over<00:00:55.149> it<00:00:55.270> so<00:00:56.079> the<00:00:56.379> yo-yos<00:00:56.620> gonna<00:00:56.770> go<00:00:56.890> this<00:00:57.039> way

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
over it so the yo-yos gonna go this way

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.520 
over it so the yo-yos gonna go this way
so<00:00:57.940> that<00:00:58.090> way<00:00:58.239> the<00:00:58.449> string<00:00:58.660> lands<00:00:59.289> right<00:00:59.500> in

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
so that way the string lands right in

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.290 
so that way the string lands right in
your<00:00:59.710> hand<00:00:59.949> and<00:01:00.460> you're<00:01:00.789> going<00:01:00.879> to<00:01:00.940> bring<00:01:01.120> your

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
your hand and you're going to bring your

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.910 
your hand and you're going to bring your
non-throw<00:01:01.570> man<00:01:01.930> underneath<00:01:02.440> and<00:01:02.710> catch<00:01:02.890> it

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
non-throw man underneath and catch it

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.120 
non-throw man underneath and catch it
when<00:01:03.219> the<00:01:03.309> string<00:01:03.520> comes<00:01:03.730> off<00:01:04.199> like<00:01:05.199> that<00:01:05.410> so

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
when the string comes off like that so

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.639 
when the string comes off like that so
it's<00:01:06.310> kind<00:01:06.490> of<00:01:06.550> a<00:01:06.670> quick<00:01:06.880> motion<00:01:07.410> but<00:01:08.410> binding

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:08.649 
it's kind of a quick motion but binding

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:10.680 
it's kind of a quick motion but binding
the<00:01:08.979> same<00:01:09.160> also<00:01:09.369> you<00:01:09.520> just<00:01:09.820> throw<00:01:10.060> the<00:01:10.420> string

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
the same also you just throw the string

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
the same also you just throw the string
at<00:01:10.930> the<00:01:10.960> yo-yo<00:01:12.539> but<00:01:13.539> yeah<00:01:13.660> so<00:01:13.930> you<00:01:14.259> pretty<00:01:14.590> much

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
at the yo-yo but yeah so you pretty much

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.460 
at the yo-yo but yeah so you pretty much
just<00:01:14.770> throw<00:01:15.130> yo<00:01:15.970> the<00:01:16.479> yo-yo<00:01:16.720> over<00:01:16.869> you<00:01:17.229> got<00:01:17.350> to

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
just throw yo the yo-yo over you got to

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.440 
just throw yo the yo-yo over you got to
make<00:01:17.560> sure<00:01:17.679> it's<00:01:17.860> the<00:01:18.520> string<00:01:18.910> comes<00:01:19.119> out<00:01:19.270> all

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
make sure it's the string comes out all

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.649 
make sure it's the string comes out all
the<00:01:19.600> way<00:01:19.720> or<00:01:20.289> else<00:01:20.440> will<00:01:20.649> snap<00:01:20.860> back<00:01:21.659> kinda

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
the way or else will snap back kinda

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:23.390 
the way or else will snap back kinda
like<00:01:22.780> that

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
like that

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.070 
like that
but<00:01:24.400> yeah<00:01:24.580> so<00:01:25.420> you<00:01:25.509> got<00:01:25.600> to<00:01:25.720> make<00:01:25.810> sure<00:01:25.930> the

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
but yeah so you got to make sure the

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.679 
but yeah so you got to make sure the
strings<00:01:26.350> like<00:01:26.439> rolled<00:01:26.740> up<00:01:26.890> well<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:28.180> you<00:01:28.570> go

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
strings like rolled up well and you go

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:31.109 
strings like rolled up well and you go
straight<00:01:28.960> under<00:01:29.380> with<00:01:29.710> your<00:01:30.130> screw<00:01:30.790> and

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
straight under with your screw and

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.780 
straight under with your screw and
that's<00:01:31.810> that<00:01:32.080> under<00:01:32.500> mouth<00:01:32.680> the<00:01:33.340> over<00:01:33.610> mount

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
that's that under mouth the over mount

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.600 
that's that under mouth the over mount
is<00:01:34.030> definitely<00:01:34.390> harder

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
is definitely harder

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.429 
is definitely harder
you're<00:01:36.610> gonna<00:01:36.700> once<00:01:37.210> you<00:01:37.329> like<00:01:37.509> catch<00:01:37.960> it<00:01:38.200> with

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
you're gonna once you like catch it with

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:40.620 
you're gonna once you like catch it with
your<00:01:38.470> non-throw<00:01:39.460> hand<00:01:39.670> you're<00:01:39.939> gonna<00:01:40.030> go<00:01:40.240> over

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
your non-throw hand you're gonna go over

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:41.910 
your non-throw hand you're gonna go over
the<00:01:40.750> yo-yo<00:01:40.960> right<00:01:40.990> away<00:01:41.320> so<00:01:41.380> you'll<00:01:41.829> be

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
the yo-yo right away so you'll be

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.890 
the yo-yo right away so you'll be
throwing<00:01:42.189> you<00:01:42.369> a<00:01:42.670> will<00:01:42.850> be<00:01:42.939> right<00:01:43.090> here<00:01:43.119> and

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
throwing you a will be right here and

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.060 
throwing you a will be right here and
you'll<00:01:44.110> have<00:01:44.140> the<00:01:44.380> string<00:01:44.680> and<00:01:44.890> you're<00:01:44.979> gonna

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
you'll have the string and you're gonna

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.060 
you'll have the string and you're gonna
go<00:01:45.280> over<00:01:45.640> it<00:01:45.790> so<00:01:46.000> you<00:01:46.030> catch<00:01:46.360> it<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.890> don't

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
go over it so you catch it you don't

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.620 
go over it so you catch it you don't
have<00:01:48.100> to<00:01:48.250> do<00:01:48.340> it<00:01:48.460> quickly<00:01:49.200> like<00:01:50.200> that

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
have to do it quickly like that

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.260 
have to do it quickly like that
but<00:01:52.530> yeah<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.159> that's<00:01:53.700> basically<00:01:54.000> all<00:01:54.119> there

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
but yeah so that's basically all there

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.300 
but yeah so that's basically all there
is<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.439> catch<00:01:55.650> he<00:01:55.950> pretty<00:01:56.100> much<00:01:56.189> is

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
is to it you catch he pretty much is

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.780 
is to it you catch he pretty much is
catch<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.640> string<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.299> loop<00:01:57.930> around<00:01:58.790> like

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
catch the string and loop around like

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.520 
catch the string and loop around like
that<00:01:59.970> and<00:02:00.210> then<00:02:00.540> you're<00:02:00.750> in<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.930> exact<00:02:01.290> same

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
that and then you're in the exact same

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.039 
that and then you're in the exact same
mouth<00:02:01.770> as<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.700> under<00:02:02.970> mouth<00:02:03.119> this<00:02:03.840> is<00:02:03.900> the

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
mouth as the under mouth this is the

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.960 
mouth as the under mouth this is the
under<00:02:04.320> mouth<00:02:04.470> right<00:02:04.830> there<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.700> then<00:02:05.850> this

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
under mouth right there and then this

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.820 
under mouth right there and then this
would<00:02:06.149> have<00:02:06.240> been<00:02:06.330> the<00:02:06.420> over<00:02:06.659> mount<00:02:06.840> foot<00:02:07.080> in

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
would have been the over mount foot in

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.820 
would have been the over mount foot in
the<00:02:08.009> end<00:02:08.190> you're<00:02:08.670> in<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.330> brain<00:02:09.509> system<00:02:09.869> and

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
the end you're in the brain system and

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:20.860 
the end you're in the brain system and
that's<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.160> trick

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870
