00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:29.730
 a friend asked his son to order some 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:30.260
 Tablet from China inexpensive in July 2014 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.110
 of the year 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:39.420
 somewhere like 12 numbers seem to be on track 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:41.730
 I looked at the number right now, I ordered it 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.570
 Bypassed now I do not remember at what price 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.559

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:59.629
 and they used about me 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.629
 more than two months my friend is 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:06.869

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:11.270

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:24.210
 and such a situation older brother came to 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.570
 little brother to visit with children 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:33.180

 from here such a tablet 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:43.170
 naturally they don't know what they have 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.070
 The voltage is different and the whole tablet is covered 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.009
 copper basin 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.700

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.340

00:01:52.340 --> 00:02:06.509
 So focus on waiting for this tablet as 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:15.920

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:57.840
 they asked me to help me repair 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:03:01.040
 This tablet learned in his city 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.750

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:10.280
 determined that the data in this tablet 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.439
 was burnt 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.099

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:26.209
