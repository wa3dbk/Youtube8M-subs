don't<00:03:06.530> know<00:03:06.710> if<00:03:06.800> you<00:03:06.890> guys<00:03:07.010> care<00:03:07.310> about<00:03:07.340> this

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
don't know if you guys care about this

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.250 
don't know if you guys care about this
but<00:03:07.850> a<00:03:07.910> lot<00:03:08.120> of<00:03:08.180> you<00:03:08.300> seemed<00:03:08.540> interested<00:03:09.110> in

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
but a lot of you seemed interested in

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.020 
but a lot of you seemed interested in
how<00:03:09.380> I<00:03:09.410> did<00:03:09.710> Joshua's<00:03:10.280> shoe<00:03:10.490> for<00:03:10.730> what's<00:03:10.910> up

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
how I did Joshua's shoe for what's up

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.510 
how I did Joshua's shoe for what's up
Internet<00:03:11.390> and<00:03:11.600> I<00:03:12.500> showed<00:03:12.740> that<00:03:12.980> in<00:03:13.190> an<00:03:13.340> earlier

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
Internet and I showed that in an earlier

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.450 
Internet and I showed that in an earlier
vlog<00:03:14.240> and<00:03:14.630> I<00:03:14.870> talked<00:03:15.110> about<00:03:15.200> using<00:03:15.770> a<00:03:15.890> grid<00:03:16.190> and

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.460 
vlog and I talked about using a grid and

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.310 
vlog and I talked about using a grid and
that<00:03:16.880> works<00:03:17.030> really<00:03:17.240> great<00:03:17.450> for<00:03:17.570> odd<00:03:17.900> shapes

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
that works really great for odd shapes

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.320 
that works really great for odd shapes
but<00:03:18.530> as<00:03:18.650> you<00:03:18.770> can<00:03:18.860> see<00:03:19.040> with<00:03:19.190> this<00:03:19.400> it's<00:03:20.060> a<00:03:20.180> lot

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
but as you can see with this it's a lot

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.710 
but as you can see with this it's a lot
of<00:03:20.450> circles<00:03:20.930> and<00:03:21.200> rectangles<00:03:21.800> right<00:03:22.370> Jacob

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
of circles and rectangles right Jacob

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.470 
of circles and rectangles right Jacob
yeah<00:03:23.720> so<00:03:24.410> for<00:03:25.280> that<00:03:25.460> type<00:03:25.790> of<00:03:25.820> thing<00:03:26.150> it's<00:03:26.360> a

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
yeah so for that type of thing it's a

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.720 
yeah so for that type of thing it's a
little<00:03:26.720> bit<00:03:26.840> better<00:03:27.230> to<00:03:27.890> just<00:03:28.130> draw<00:03:28.400> it<00:03:28.550> to

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
little bit better to just draw it to

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.710 
little bit better to just draw it to
scale<00:03:28.760> and<00:03:29.300> use<00:03:29.630> this<00:03:29.870> tool<00:03:30.200> right<00:03:30.470> here<00:03:31.720> this

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
scale and use this tool right here this

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.710 
scale and use this tool right here this
is<00:03:33.140> called<00:03:33.470> an<00:03:33.740> architect<00:03:34.430> scale<00:03:34.820> so<00:03:35.150> on<00:03:35.510> this

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
is called an architect scale so on this

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.500 
is called an architect scale so on this
you<00:03:35.840> can<00:03:35.959> see<00:03:36.170> on<00:03:36.410> one<00:03:36.440> side<00:03:36.709> it<00:03:37.220> has<00:03:37.510> regular

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
you can see on one side it has regular

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.850 
you can see on one side it has regular
inches<00:03:39.470> and<00:03:39.800> then<00:03:40.610> each<00:03:40.880> of<00:03:40.940> the<00:03:41.240> other<00:03:41.420> sides

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
inches and then each of the other sides

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.970 
inches and then each of the other sides
has<00:03:42.860> a<00:03:43.310> different<00:03:43.730> scale<00:03:44.120> so<00:03:44.540> for<00:03:45.290> example

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
has a different scale so for example

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.840 
has a different scale so for example
this<00:03:46.430> is<00:03:46.490> the<00:03:46.640> one<00:03:46.790> I<00:03:46.820> used<00:03:47.150> for<00:03:47.390> this<00:03:47.540> it<00:03:47.930> is

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
this is the one I used for this it is

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.420 
this is the one I used for this it is
3/4<00:03:49.850> scaled<00:03:50.330> and<00:03:50.600> that<00:03:50.720> means<00:03:50.930> every<00:03:51.400> 3/4<00:03:52.400> of

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
3/4 scaled and that means every 3/4 of

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.840 
3/4 scaled and that means every 3/4 of
an<00:03:52.760> inch<00:03:53.000> counts<00:03:53.990> as<00:03:54.110> a<00:03:54.170> foot<00:03:54.620> so<00:03:55.310> on<00:03:55.550> this

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
an inch counts as a foot so on this

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.040 
an inch counts as a foot so on this
thing<00:03:56.209> every<00:03:56.900> 3/4<00:03:57.650> of<00:03:57.680> an<00:03:57.950> inch<00:03:58.209> equals<00:03:59.209> one

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050 
thing every 3/4 of an inch equals one

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.140 
thing every 3/4 of an inch equals one
foot<00:04:00.440> so<00:04:00.680> all<00:04:00.800> I<00:04:00.830> had<00:04:01.040> to<00:04:01.070> do<00:04:01.280> is<00:04:01.519> measure<00:04:01.790> each

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
foot so all I had to do is measure each

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.830 
foot so all I had to do is measure each
thing<00:04:02.510> out<00:04:02.750> and<00:04:03.489> figure<00:04:04.489> out<00:04:04.640> okay<00:04:05.060> this<00:04:05.090> here

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
thing out and figure out okay this here

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.320 
thing out and figure out okay this here
is<00:04:06.019> going<00:04:06.470> to<00:04:06.530> be<00:04:06.709> the<00:04:07.430> center<00:04:07.850> of<00:04:07.940> this<00:04:08.060> circle

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
is going to be the center of this circle

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.250 
is going to be the center of this circle
is<00:04:08.750> going<00:04:09.080> to<00:04:09.230> be<00:04:09.320> two<00:04:09.800> feet<00:04:10.220> five<00:04:11.120> inches<00:04:11.260> from

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
is going to be two feet five inches from

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.170 
is going to be two feet five inches from
the<00:04:12.380> edge<00:04:12.530> so<00:04:13.310> I<00:04:13.340> just<00:04:13.550> measured<00:04:13.940> everything

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
the edge so I just measured everything

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.110 
the edge so I just measured everything
and<00:04:14.510> drew<00:04:14.870> all<00:04:14.900> the<00:04:15.350> lines<00:04:15.620> with<00:04:15.920> pencil<00:04:16.370> now

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
and drew all the lines with pencil now

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.880 
and drew all the lines with pencil now
Jacob<00:04:17.540> wanted<00:04:17.959> to<00:04:18.049> know<00:04:18.200> how<00:04:18.440> I<00:04:18.470> made<00:04:18.590> these

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
Jacob wanted to know how I made these

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:24.310 
Jacob wanted to know how I made these
circles<00:04:19.400> and<00:04:20.560> I<00:04:21.560> used<00:04:21.859> this<00:04:22.419> very<00:04:23.419> basic<00:04:24.050> tool

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
circles and I used this very basic tool

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.350 
circles and I used this very basic tool
this<00:04:24.650> is<00:04:24.710> a<00:04:24.980> compass<00:04:25.520> that<00:04:25.550> I<00:04:25.760> made<00:04:25.910> out<00:04:26.120> of<00:04:26.150> a

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
this is a compass that I made out of a

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.510 
this is a compass that I made out of a
piece<00:04:26.600> of<00:04:26.630> cardboard<00:04:27.350> and<00:04:27.500> basically<00:04:28.340> there's

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
piece of cardboard and basically there's

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.330 
piece of cardboard and basically there's
a<00:04:28.580> screw<00:04:28.970> here<00:04:29.300> and<00:04:29.680> then<00:04:30.680> I<00:04:30.770> measured<00:04:31.160> out<00:04:31.310> the

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
a screw here and then I measured out the

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.100 
a screw here and then I measured out the
radius<00:04:31.880> of<00:04:32.030> a<00:04:32.090> circle<00:04:32.120> that's<00:04:32.690> from<00:04:32.960> the

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
radius of a circle that's from the

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.659 
radius of a circle that's from the
center<00:04:33.470> to<00:04:33.650> the<00:04:33.680> edge<00:04:33.890> of<00:04:34.010> the<00:04:34.130> circles<00:04:34.520> or

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
center to the edge of the circles or

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.330 
center to the edge of the circles or
radius<00:04:34.970> so<00:04:35.630> I'd<00:04:35.750> measure<00:04:35.960> that<00:04:36.230> out<00:04:36.290> and<00:04:36.740> I'd

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
radius so I'd measure that out and I'd

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.640 
radius so I'd measure that out and I'd
put<00:04:37.669> a<00:04:37.850> pencil<00:04:38.270> in<00:04:38.570> there<00:04:38.750> and<00:04:38.930> then<00:04:39.380> all<00:04:39.590> I

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
put a pencil in there and then all I

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.860 
put a pencil in there and then all I
have<00:04:39.860> to<00:04:39.950> do<00:04:40.100> is<00:04:40.190> hold<00:04:40.430> this<00:04:40.640> here<00:04:40.970> and<00:04:41.180> turn

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
have to do is hold this here and turn

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.560 
have to do is hold this here and turn
here

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:50.920 

if<00:04:45.570> I<00:04:45.780> go<00:04:45.900> all<00:04:46.050> the<00:04:46.080> way<00:04:46.199> around<00:04:46.880> it<00:04:47.880> makes<00:04:48.150> a

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.050 

circle<00:04:51.930> that's<00:04:52.080> exactly<00:04:52.680> the<00:04:52.830> size<00:04:53.039> that<00:04:54.030> I

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
circle that's exactly the size that I

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.969 
circle that's exactly the size that I
need<00:04:54.180> so<00:04:54.720> if<00:04:54.810> you<00:04:54.900> need<00:04:55.020> to<00:04:55.050> make<00:04:55.199> a<00:04:55.259> big<00:04:55.470> circle

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
need so if you need to make a big circle

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:58.010 
need so if you need to make a big circle
on<00:04:56.100> something<00:04:56.580> all<00:04:56.789> you<00:04:56.910> need<00:04:57.150> is<00:04:57.389> a<00:04:57.419> piece<00:04:57.840> of

on something all you need is a piece of
wood<00:04:58.229> or<00:04:58.470> cardboard<00:04:58.860> that<00:04:59.460> you<00:04:59.520> can<00:04:59.669> punch<00:04:59.940> a

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
wood or cardboard that you can punch a

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.629
