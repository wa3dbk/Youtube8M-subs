banding I think it's from me messing
with<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.650> speeds<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.310> stuff<00:01:11.780> so<00:01:12.780> I'll<00:01:12.870> just

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
with the speeds and stuff so I'll just

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.740 
with the speeds and stuff so I'll just
let<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.290> run<00:01:13.640> at<00:01:14.640> this<00:01:14.880> speed<00:01:15.030> for<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.510> rest<00:01:15.660> of

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
let it run at this speed for the rest of

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:50.700 
let it run at this speed for the rest of
the<00:01:15.869> print<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.580> see<00:01:17.580> how<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.790> comes<00:01:17.940> out
