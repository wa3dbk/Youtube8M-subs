00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
that to mike's wash row I thought that

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.750 
that to mike's wash row I thought that
it<00:00:43.410> was<00:00:43.620> kind<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.950> cheap<00:00:44.160> shot<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.550> he<00:00:44.610> took

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760

it was kind of a cheap shot that he took
a<00:00:44.820> towel<00:00:45.000> Saunders<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.690> thought<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.140> there

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
a towel Saunders I thought that there

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.709 
a towel Saunders I thought that there
wasn't<00:00:46.829> in<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.280> be<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.550> criticism<00:00:47.940> as<00:00:48.629> he

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
wasn't in to be that criticism as he

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.020 
wasn't in to be that criticism as he
compared<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.260> two<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:50.219> so<00:00:50.340> as<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.579> was<00:00:50.610> talking

a time here's the clip right now but

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.800 
a time here's the clip right now but
when<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.070> define<00:01:11.580> al<00:01:12.030> Saunders<00:01:12.600> with<00:01:12.780> a

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
when you define al Saunders with a

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.499 
when you define al Saunders with a
top-four<00:01:13.560> rank<00:01:13.979> off<00:01:14.220> bench<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:14.790> top<00:01:15.000> five<00:01:15.299> in

Manhattan<00:06:25.490> so<00:06:25.610> I<00:06:25.639> think<00:06:25.759> that<00:06:25.940> carries<00:06:26.300> over<00:06:26.419> a

00:06:26.559 --> 00:06:26.569 
Manhattan so I think that carries over a

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:28.990 
Manhattan so I think that carries over a
little<00:06:26.720> bit<00:06:26.900> I<00:06:27.259> felt<00:06:28.130> think<00:06:28.430> a<00:06:28.610> state<00:06:28.849> with

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.000

this<00:06:29.210> game<00:06:29.449> but<00:06:29.599> I<00:06:29.660> think<00:06:29.900> most<00:06:30.139> importantly

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:30.380 
this game but I think most importantly

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.260 
this game but I think most importantly
you<00:06:31.039> look<00:06:31.250> at<00:06:31.370> this<00:06:31.520> game<00:06:31.759> from<00:06:31.940> a<00:06:32.030> k-state

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:57.530 
tomorrow scary exactly right it could be

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.350

00:06:59.350 --> 00:06:59.360 
a classification to keep looking at for

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.850 
a classification to keep looking at for
another<00:06:59.570> how<00:06:59.960> will<00:07:00.110> it<00:07:00.199> taste<00:07:00.229> it<00:07:00.530> to<00:07:00.710> look

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:00.860 
another how will it taste it to look

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.200 
another how will it taste it to look
past<00:07:01.039> Texas<00:07:01.430> I<00:07:01.520> think<00:07:01.729> that's<00:07:01.849> pretty<00:07:02.000> much

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:02.210 
past Texas I think that's pretty much

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:04.749 
past Texas I think that's pretty much
impossible<00:07:02.389> and<00:07:03.169> Texas<00:07:03.530> obviously<00:07:03.979> it<00:07:04.400> ok<00:07:04.639> say

00:07:04.749 --> 00:07:04.759 
impossible and Texas obviously it ok say

00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:05.920 
impossible and Texas obviously it ok say
that<00:07:04.940> their<00:07:05.090> attention<00:07:05.419> because<00:07:05.630> they<00:07:05.750> want

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:05.930 
that their attention because they want

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:07.450 
that their attention because they want
last<00:07:06.110> year<00:07:06.289> so<00:07:06.470> I<00:07:06.650> don't<00:07:06.919> think<00:07:07.130> you're<00:07:07.310> going

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:07.460 
last year so I don't think you're going

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.100 
last year so I don't think you're going
to<00:07:07.520> have<00:07:07.610> both<00:07:07.699> team<00:07:07.940> looking<00:07:08.240> past<00:07:08.449> it<00:07:08.659> I<00:07:08.810> do

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:09.110 
to have both team looking past it I do

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.469 
to have both team looking past it I do
think<00:07:09.650> however<00:07:09.830> that<00:07:10.190> case<00:07:10.849> state<00:07:11.150> from<00:07:11.360> a

00:07:11.469 --> 00:07:11.479 
think however that case state from a

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:13.450 
think however that case state from a
physical<00:07:11.990> standpoint<00:07:12.289> might<00:07:12.800> get<00:07:13.009> beat<00:07:13.220> up<00:07:13.250> a

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:13.460 
physical standpoint might get beat up a

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.680 
physical standpoint might get beat up a
little<00:07:13.639> bit<00:07:13.729> of<00:07:13.789> this<00:07:13.880> game<00:07:14.090> and<00:07:14.240> I<00:07:14.300> wonder<00:07:14.599> how

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:14.690 
little bit of this game and I wonder how

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:16.510 
little bit of this game and I wonder how
that<00:07:14.840> affects<00:07:15.169> next<00:07:15.530> week's<00:07:15.710> game<00:07:15.889> against
