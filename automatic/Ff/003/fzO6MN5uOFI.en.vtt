00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 halli hello people and most beautiful again 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.230
 I wanted to turn on today 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.660
 talking about hair again and that about 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.910
 silicones so on the hair and 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.900
 not on other things 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.150
 I just want to give you a little bit 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.910
 clarify what the customer is like what the 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.420
 make courses and why silicones so bad 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.930
 are and yes there are yes they are high 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.730
 So there are people who can debate 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.619
 completely without silicone and get along well 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.510
 say oh my god silicones are shit 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.800
 and there are people who are interested 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.219
 not really, and for that I have 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.719
 belongs 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.309
 I have always thought that want 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.559
 the land because with their silicone in 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.670
 He is almost in every shampoo in the Hague 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.950
 Why should I coach on it? 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.300
 renounce 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.100
 I've been clever because 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.239
 a subscriber has meant more yes 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:51.870
 you often use disco things for yours 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.840
 hair of it somehow not quite out 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:59.070
 or what he fresh so I have no word 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.170
 for and I figured why then 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.510
 is my what make silicone 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.580
 I want you now 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.340
 tell times in the silicon 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.290
 film world that means educate 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.030
 practically a movie a nice silicone 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.920
 layer on the hair the reason why 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.110
 So silicon.de so in shampoos 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.700
 It is easy to use that 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.409
 that then the hair nice and smooth 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.799
 makes you look that way too 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.900
 are easier by camper and yes why 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.750
 should it be so bad 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.939
 yes the shadow sides of silicone are 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.250
 by being in this movie 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.100
 and most silicones for example 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.570
 that with i could do it well 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.729
 best known silicone and almost stands 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.259
 everywhere at the whole silicone bubbly 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.079
 And that's at least 80 percent 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.899
 or so if gm is then always behind 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:49.740
 nice jogi with the congstar in it yes 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:53.130
 the wild ones watch this movie and are often 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:56.130
 not water soluble that is hydrophobic 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.079
 just those who stay tuned 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.880
 does not mean under not that 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.469
 kidney on the way there 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.869
 whole campus because then she also left 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.280
 If you were on the 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.020
 the customers will give up because if 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.599
 to use bubbly with silicone 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.860
 a new layer is coming and they were 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.489
 Hair somehow does not come at all 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.310
 the fore 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.260
 that's the drawback to point virtually 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.599
 on hair with silicone full true form 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.510
 It is said to obscure the true form 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.130
 is often not quite as nice as that 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.720
 we see here and I would be 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.450
 Let's say that my hair is shining 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.110
 nice to be that but then rather 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.880
 so full of splinters everything dries up 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.739
 possible what is at hearing 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.299
 Actually it can be there 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.760
 of course, it does not have to be that 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.140
 but it is often the same because you are 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.870
 just these damages with it 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.420
 that is, it covers schampus voland 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.599
 on it is indeed the ultimate tips 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.130
 repair then do not repair tips 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.069
 if he's in seconds but 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.599
 just cover up the damage but 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.489
 It's basically I do not think so 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.170
 bad work for me now no 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.980
 reason to switch because somehow 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.650
 silicone free 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.019
 the really bad thing about silicone is 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.510
 if you go to now so if you look at one 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.910
 long time seen for silicones permanently 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.920
 then the hair gets used like that 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.260
 bit the walls hard and found 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.000
 just so wonder is about and so 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.870
 It does not look great either but that 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.790
 I could now not with me 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.010
 notice and I do not know any 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.600
 I know because if I am convinced 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.160
 but then I read that 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.269
 Silicones are also on the 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.680
 put scalp 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.450
 You can do that too because I mean mine 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.889
 If I put the hair and sometimes enough 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.269
 It then her beautiful head on a 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:32.579
 why should not they there too 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.959
 get stuck and they do that and there 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:36.389
 are the consequences then, for example 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:39.030
 then shingles have some 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:40.769
 burn it just observes that 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.410
 she is allergic to this icon 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.970
 have and hair loss and that has me 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.639
 a bit startled hair loss 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.900
 is not that great but i have 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:51.840
 can never realize that 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.190
 I was more than what was the 100 km h should 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.910
 you do not lose and so much was it 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.510
 actually never 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.579
 I still have the 100 00 at 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.769
 rhi made test if I now our the 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:04.650
 customer from cham or 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:07.019
 and yes then I have such a shampoo 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.109
 bought that somehow in dm so 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:11.400
 a little bit fooled around this is this 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:14.040
 aussie aussie I do not know how to do it 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.609
 probably speaking and looks 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.169
 yes there is this lashes long shampoo 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.800
 for long hair care 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:24.300
 see and my hair is pulling 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.759
 probably very after care 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.800
 all that silicone stress I did 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:31.289
 So I tried that in and 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.960
 Although there are no silicones in there but in 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:35.880
 conditions and could do that and in 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.330
 The bubbly did not stand in it 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.889
 The cures of looks are silicones 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.509
 That's why I have it 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:44.550
 I think I had something from then 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:46.050
 garnier where no silicone with relevant 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.759
 being in a conditioner while being flushed 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.580
 actually almost always silicones 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:52.139
 trainers are what should really look like 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:55.530
 By the way, one recognizes at the end com 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:58.470
 or I forgot the other one now 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.150
 I'll write it down to you yes that 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.669
 Result was not great so 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.229
 Of course not because after all 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:06.120
 silicone, it is one you eat it ja 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:07.949
 at least somewhat used to the hair 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.780
 not quite as hulking look 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:11.610
 so always his bubbly the 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.259
 for a perfectly is my I was 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.940
 that depends always on the type 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:16.380
 I'm there for example is the whole 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.960
 time the disco was used and was 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:22.199
 actually happy with it 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.909
 after the aussie treatment are so 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:26.520
 my hair who says there are some then 

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:27.930
 damage emerged and that was not 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.159
 More so beautiful I was fresh at 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.990
 Barber and then I had at once 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:33.300
 anyway everywhere again split my 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.159
 hair when dry and I then 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.900
 always so dry at my hair tips 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:40.289
 were also such a silicone free oil of 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:44.820
 Alverde uses the house 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:45.960
 oelmann de la gare too brittle and short 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.360
 hair and dry scalp 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.979
 the problem with these oils is always 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.969
 that this gets done a bit and 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:52.949
 while pretty fast 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:55.169
 they had am I doing every three 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:56.639
 Days maybe not so often because 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:06:00.479
 my hair color and then simply because 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:01.770
 you do not vettel so fast I have it 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:03.360
 Then once before it gets on the scalp 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.639
 and my hair but after a day 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.139
 already really ready and therefore me 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:09.779
 then still used the tips 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:12.120
 but it is also pretty fast again 

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:13.479
 finished and that's why 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.220
 not so 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:18.650
 I started now again 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.690
 So after the victor and free 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.699
 treatment at least again, so to speak 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:25.699
 my gliss cure my disco flushing 

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:30.530
 So use this to this here 

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:32.180
 activity minute intensive course and 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.800
 I did not know I could handle you like that 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.389
 misses because it smells so good and me 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.919
 So do not shut up , it's just really 

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:38.990
 each even cede was 

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:39.410
 silicones on his hair or would like 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:42.440
 Not 

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:43.759
 I think it was just fine that I did 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.759
 did this test 

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:49.310
 as a balance , I pull there and looks down 

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:51.110
 It really bad and I think so 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:53.539
 I would prefer silicones on it 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:55.039
 I mean sometimes I use it 

00:06:53.539 --> 00:06:56.539
 maybe every month 

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:59.300
 long or easy for a few weeks 

00:06:56.539 --> 00:07:00.740
 no silicones or I have 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.180
 now the ultimate recommendation for the 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:04.820
 People really without silicone 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:07.400
 kinda looking for bubbly or something like that 

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:09.410
 is really a really great shampoo 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.880
 even better than my disc causes and 

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:14.570
 does not cost so much and that of 

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:17.599
 Alverde's intensively building shampoo with 

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:18.560
 amaranth and that is really real 

00:07:17.599 --> 00:07:21.080
 really good 

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.970
 I always use it now 

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:25.099
 always my whiskey stuff and me 

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:27.020
 Have to say this shampoo makes the hair 

00:07:25.099 --> 00:07:28.789
 really great works and the limits of 

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:31.490
 do not train and work that way anymore 

00:07:28.789 --> 00:07:33.260
 So it was broken because of that 

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:35.930
 my tips completely dry so 

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:38.150
 really really I do not know I 

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:39.740
 do not look like a poodle like that 

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:42.289
 It was not that full I say mine 

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:43.759
 she from the dieter bohlen fans because he 

00:07:42.289 --> 00:07:45.139
 earlier times has his mane and 

00:07:43.759 --> 00:07:47.240
 somehow everything too straw to say 

00:07:45.139 --> 00:07:50.150
 that's why it's a bit stupid 

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:51.770
 but the shampoo is good 

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:54.860
 that was it for my silicone 

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:56.210
 So video is decided as I said 

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.080
 for yourself you can do it 

00:07:56.210 --> 00:08:00.789
 try out 

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:04.009
 we can also leave it so yes me 

00:08:00.789 --> 00:08:05.750
 So had my balance has me now 

00:08:04.009 --> 00:08:08.750
 not hundreds probably convinced 

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:10.820
 also just because i have this whole head 

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:12.169
 Skin damage and somehow never will 

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:14.389
 could find out with me 

00:08:12.169 --> 00:08:18.159
 Although it sits as possible and then see 

00:08:14.389 --> 00:08:18.159
 the next time together
