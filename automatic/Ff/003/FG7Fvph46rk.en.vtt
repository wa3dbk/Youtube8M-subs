put your pull it we're going to do this

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:45.820 
put your pull it we're going to do this
down<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.620> end<00:00:37.949> and<00:00:38.129> put<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.280> hole<00:00:38.520> in<00:00:38.670> it

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:45.830 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.070 

all<00:00:46.830> right<00:00:46.949> so<00:00:47.309> we're<00:00:48.300> getting<00:00:48.510> closer

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.080 
all right so we're getting closer

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.729 
all right so we're getting closer
that's<00:00:50.070> obviously<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.120> center<00:00:51.630> the<00:00:52.440> upper

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
that's obviously the center the upper

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.860 
that's obviously the center the upper
end<00:00:53.030> it<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.180> but<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.450> means<00:00:54.600> he's<00:00:54.719> not<00:00:54.809> a

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
end it is but that means he's not a

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:55.819 
end it is but that means he's not a
point<00:00:55.170> on<00:00:55.290> that<00:00:55.410> one

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
point on that one

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.530
