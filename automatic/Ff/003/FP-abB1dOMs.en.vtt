00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:15.049
 hello everyone here presenting 

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:17.119
 let's see here the staff that exercises a 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:21.140
 little bad we are not going to try the 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.939
 skills the passive is the skills 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.289
 that grants a shield that is equal by 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.610
 hundred the maximum life for three 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:31.390
 seconds and has a CD of 18 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:34.050
 I use a bridle and look at my life it gets 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.050
 one shield at a time 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:41.540
 OK 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:43.550
 What you do is load a fist what 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.160
 throw forward 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.379
 and it slows down and I slowed down a 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.340
 little while loading it is lengthening 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.480
 of the rank and if the against subjects the 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:57.250
 crosses that would also be the 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.250
 champions the top how is this 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:08.689
 and remove armor each is from another without 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:11.070
 armor with this one is not the w every three 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:14.610
 blows remove 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:19.410
 removes a maximum damage one year inflicts 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:22.670
 damage equal to maximum life is not 6% 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.670
 plus a percentage of what is 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:31.600
 every three reduces the armor to 12 was 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:36.009
 remove value 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:39.280
 the charge causes the charge here two are loaded 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:41.840
 fists gives two punches left 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.410
 It's been a year since you're paying and 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.860
 to those behind me as we shall see here 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.860
 this pool 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:56.310
 good is going to die the poor 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.310
 to see the bad of absorbing life 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.960
 absorb 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.060
 matellÃ¡n matrices and now let's see the 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.040
 last mark as you mark with objective 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.989
 in champion that chases him from above 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.599
 for so long in working at 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:26.800

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.580
 kill him to kill not bitten 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.590
 we see so many 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.940
 nothing nothing fears 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.340
