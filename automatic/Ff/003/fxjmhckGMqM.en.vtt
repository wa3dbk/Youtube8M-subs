 Authentic World Food states 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.180
 how to cook. 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.660
 KARI Z LILKÅ® 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.740
 Hi there is Bo` on the road and Authentic World Food. 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.480
 We're in the village of Midigama, Sri Lanka. 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.760
 And because in Sri Lanka they make curry from all kinds of vegetables, 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.320
 so eggplant will be no exception. 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.660
 So first cut the eggplant with the fries skin. 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.860
 As is customary in Sri Lanka, we rinse everything off. 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.300
 Then add a few green chillies and red onions. 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.720
 There's a beautiful silence today. So all you can hear is the birds singing in the palm grove. 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.700
 So I did not deliberately put any music in the background to enjoy the peaceful atmosphere with us. 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.240
 Then add the chopped tomatoes. 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.640
 Now we'll prepare all the spices. 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.420
 Let's start with caraway, which is called "duru" in Silany. 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.720
 Then add the ground chili 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.740
 and turmeric. Since "kaha" in Sinhalese means turmeric, so no curry as I guessed. 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.700
 And of course some salt. 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.220
 You should also add curry leaves and pandan leaves if you have them. 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:58.040
 Latta has forgotten to put them there, but without worry, I reminded her, so she'll give them there. 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.220
 I'm becoming a Sri Lankan cuisine specialist :) 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.020
 Mix everything well 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.060
 and the last very important part is homemade coconut milk. 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.260
 It should be about 2/3 of the blend of eggplant. 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.080
 Latta looks terribly strict today, but believe me, she's very nice. 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.360
 We are very lucky today, not only because there is this amazing chill and singing birds, 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.780
 but there is still a wonderful light, the smoke that weaves through the rays of the sun through the chimney. 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.540
 And that's how it always looks a few minutes in the morning, so we're very lucky to be here :) 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.700
 Yeah, and now there are those forgotten curry and pandan leaves. 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.480
 Cook everything tilted for 15-20 minutes. 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.760
 They use dry leaves of coconut palms and dried coconut husks as fuel. 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.840
 And now we see food tasting in Sri Lanka. 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.720
 They just pour a little sauce into their hands and taste it. 

00:03:29.793 --> 00:03:32.093
 So it looks like we're done for today. 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.400
 And as usual, serve with rice and other types of Sri Lankan curry. 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.260
