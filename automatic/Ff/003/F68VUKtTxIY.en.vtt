 how about a fire reduced to ashes 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:24.150
 five homes in San Miguel in one act 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.580
 inexplicable those affected attacked 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.119
 the firefighters that mark went to 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.119
 attend the emergency 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:37.200
 these flames swept away in less than 30 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.020
 minutes and before the astonished look of 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.649
 these settlers with five homes of

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.410

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:59.240
 according to the villagers a short circuit 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.240
 would have caused the sinister 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:06.570
 what would have caused the fire apologize 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:14.580
 a short circuit spark 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:14.580
 in front of the distracted at home 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:27.010
 the people were about five 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:29.650
 children plus or minus four four children and 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.170
 four adults four adults and all that 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:35.590
 lit like four burning houses 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:39.600
 another second-story houses things happen 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.600
 look raising account 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.520
 only one floor is the first the 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.500
 second floor what is consuming 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.619
 personnel of the general fire brigade 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.869
 volunteers from Peru used these 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.869
 stairs when you reach the second floor of 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.850
 your place and in that way control the 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.040
 fire 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.340
 while some neighbors helped with 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.680
 buckets of water and hoses other 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.990
 they inexplicably assaulted journalists 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.020
 and firefighters who came to attend the 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.020
 emergency 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.900
 The truth is that it is unfortunate that the 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.250
 staff come to cover an emergency 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.130
 try to help people and be 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.680
 attacked by people good 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.880
 supposedly not live, we have seen that 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.250
 has not been and how we know the attention 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.580
 we have even voted it because if not 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.380
 were you not it would not be anything concrete 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.910
 because not even being able to 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.410
 open because you come to do your 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.410
 work is not called your partner 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:50.269
 6 units of firefighters and a cistern of 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.879
 water were necessary to turn off the 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:55.750
 fire that fortunately did not leave any 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:55.750
 Wounded person 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.220
 comes a civil tragedy
