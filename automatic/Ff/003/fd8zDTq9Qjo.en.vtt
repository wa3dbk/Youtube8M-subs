00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.460
 account of this in case I already have a 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.460
 account 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.940
 choreas for this one 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.839

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.940
 this was not 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.530
 jump to posey yes it was good this 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.510
 you have seen censored with chrome to the 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.640
 channel bitch of 6000 but I'll let that 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.050
 someone whatever it is worth and 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.480
 good since once you have created 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.100
 the account of this I link it with this 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.830
 that this also you see censored 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.720
 because he does not know the eggs which is good 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.680
 basically 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:30.870
 let's go of his dance pothole 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.210
 to see Jesus 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.730
 h of ballet is a youtube if you do not 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.430
 you know basically the colleges go out 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.560
 it's worth it and it's here the club will get pearls 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.690
 but it's worth it's still working but not 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.970
 they give us nothing so much because you have the 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.950
 high and good level is the first thing that 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.050
 has to do is lower ozaki runs 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.630
 it is worth what he tries to investigate lives 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.490
 then it got one already as 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.530
 I had to start the account exactly 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.510
 now they are initials of aysa and of course this 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.060
 I already did everything 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:04.470
 this is worth here the only thing that you have to 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:07.560
 do is give year to add to play 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:10.020
 Okay, it does not go to front games, it's worth it and 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.600
 it's quite salt you have to have people 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.540
 off you have to be out of 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.240
 gta and once done this is ok let's go 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.760
 to go to the gta san andreas you will see that with 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:24.630
 gta san andreas agency 5 that what there is 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.550
 as you will see here a transmission in 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.620
 the one that I'll go to capture now of 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.360
 according to the law until now because 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.340
 now good so far we're on 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.010
 back if we go back 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.510
 we are in gt5 vale and one we are going to 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.560
 say it 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.120
 how to do how to do those little things like 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.970
 It's like getting into the game that has 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.730
 created his or whoever in my case the 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:52.470
 nexus one of the main ones and we to the 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:55.739
 menu to be valid online to the right x 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:58.530
 activities and also you give isa and be 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.690
 the host of an activity there 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.310
 you have to give is to marked what 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.489
 that we have marked before in the social 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.109
 club there from rockstar oil that already 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.909
 that will come out in my case is in 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:12.150
 racing in any case it is in 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:15.569
 part of death what is worth in my 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.909
 case is rpp pp is that he has created nexus I 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:21.480
 I have another one that is easier to make clear 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:25.440
 taught that it's easier because you do not have 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.420
 what to touch we will receive you because in 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.579
 this test I drive a little faster 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.760
 of the car as faster and good here 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:34.920
 things and web 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.280
 you want the music but to listen 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.280
 music 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:44.110
 you remove traffic so that it does not collide 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:47.850
 with the cars and the time because either 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.850
 the morning and you're done 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.570
 I will confirm and no longer invite anyone 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.820
 are the main what you want to say 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.310
 that you do not have to invite anyone because 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:03.450
 if you invite someone the experience goes to 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:07.040
 be minor and if you are level 5 or less or 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:12.170
 greater than the same you will get what they are 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:15.540
 600 or better if you're level 30 you get a thousand 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:18.209
 depending on the level of agreement that is 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:21.810
 what what is happening will be to 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:25.680
 level 71 3 thousand soles 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:28.650
 then my mouth called me like that and that's it 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.570
 it's late now ready to play do not buy anything 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.070
 no copei nor ammunition and armor or anything 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.650
 because it's not silly 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.900
 I repeat, do not mess with friends because 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.900
 the experience is going to be lower and it is already 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.120
 that ballast that go taking that that not 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.919
 basically no use but it's a 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.080
 foolishness but it is not foolish is it 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:48.990
 how is the turbo it is to take turbo the 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.580
 correct the turbo and a mass and driving 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.380
 here where those usually hit me 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.710
 I lose control of the car and it happens 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.580
 this applies 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:59.099
 yes no button 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.900
 just caught the gta 5 does nothing and 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:03.470
 I was looking for this for a lot and erp 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.729
 final and you're done 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.979
 A lot of people, according to the soil, confuse 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:09.360
 rpp of the only thing in the lp of the game the 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:11.689
 herpes of play in the experience that 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.939
 wins and the rp of the lole is the money that 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:16.469
 can you get it you're worth this is the 

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:19.320
 real money and people can be bought 

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:21.420
 with the stain 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.330
 ten seconds until what you want 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:30.960
 but normally those 30 seconds but 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:33.510
 if this does not happen to you and you give for 600 and 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.000
 we go to level 6 and to it doing it 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.830
 sanchis and it bores you to be and so do not have 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.020
 what to do they put juanje on day 5 and that 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.760
