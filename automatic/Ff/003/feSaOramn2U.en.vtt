actually in the various pieces of

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.179 
actually in the various pieces of

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
information that they actually said they

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.039

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
want to do the multiplayer in mass

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.760 
want to do the multiplayer in mass
effect<00:01:46.439> 2<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.990> actually<00:01:48.990> started<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.290> work<00:01:49.530> on

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
effect 2 and actually started to work on

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.410 
effect 2 and actually started to work on
it<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.130> just<00:01:50.340> figured<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.640> was<00:01:50.790> too<00:01:50.970> much<00:01:51.000> so

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
it and I just figured it was too much so

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.179 
it and I just figured it was too much so
they<00:01:51.570> actually<00:01:51.689> delayed<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.500> for<00:01:52.680> mass<00:01:52.829> effect

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
they actually delayed it for mass effect

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.550 
they actually delayed it for mass effect
3<00:01:53.579> this<00:01:54.119> is<00:01:54.299> actually<00:01:54.630> Quan<00:01:54.899> tree<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.409> what<00:01:55.530> a

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
3 this is actually Quan tree to what a

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.580 
3 this is actually Quan tree to what a
lot<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.799> people<00:01:55.920> fought<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.990> myself<00:01:57.990> included

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
lot of people fought and myself included

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.510 
lot of people fought and myself included
i<00:01:58.710> actually<00:01:59.119> assumed<00:02:00.409> that<00:02:01.409> mass<00:02:01.920> effect<00:02:02.280> 3

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
i actually assumed that mass effect 3

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.679 
i actually assumed that mass effect 3
was<00:02:02.670> just<00:02:02.850> something<00:02:03.119> they<00:02:03.240> were<00:02:03.329> like<00:02:03.479> hey

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
multiplayer aspect of mass effect 3 i'll

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.210 
multiplayer aspect of mass effect 3 i'll
tell<00:02:21.780> you<00:02:21.930> why<00:02:22.880> it's<00:02:23.880> actually<00:02:24.390> a<00:02:24.570> very<00:02:25.220> simple

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
tell you why it's actually a very simple

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.180 
tell you why it's actually a very simple
reason<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:26.820> that's<00:02:27.690> because<00:02:27.870> i<00:02:28.320> don't<00:02:28.680> really

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
reason and that's because i don't really

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.600 
reason and that's because i don't really
like<00:02:29.550> the<00:02:29.820> idea<00:02:29.850> of<00:02:30.330> multiple<00:02:30.780> other<00:02:31.650> people

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
like the idea of multiple other people

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.870 
like the idea of multiple other people
paying<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.990> same<00:02:34.230> storyline<00:02:34.860> I<00:02:35.370> know<00:02:35.490> it's

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
paying the same storyline I know it's

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.480 
paying the same storyline I know it's
obvious<00:02:36.300> that<00:02:36.330> other<00:02:36.600> people<00:02:36.930> do<00:02:37.340> but<00:02:38.340> I<00:02:38.400> like

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
obvious that other people do but I like

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.400 
obvious that other people do but I like
to<00:02:38.670> feel<00:02:38.910> like<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.240> hero<00:02:39.540> of<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.990> story<00:02:40.050> that

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
to feel like the hero of the story that

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.780 
to feel like the hero of the story that
makes<00:02:40.890> sense<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:41.930> just<00:02:42.930> similar<00:02:43.200> too<00:02:43.560> much<00:02:44.490> of

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
makes sense and just similar too much of

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.720 
makes sense and just similar too much of
republic<00:02:45.330> online<00:02:45.540> I<00:02:46.459> couldn't<00:02:47.459> really<00:02:47.550> get

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
republic online I couldn't really get

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.310 
republic online I couldn't really get
into<00:02:48.000> it<00:02:48.030> because<00:02:48.240> I<00:02:48.390> like<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.690> original

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
into it because I like the original

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.949 
into it because I like the original
storyline<00:02:49.740> or<00:02:50.160> say<00:02:50.610> the<00:02:51.120> old<00:02:51.240> republic<00:02:51.420> one

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
and the idea of kind of sharing that

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.010 
and the idea of kind of sharing that
universal<00:02:56.370> everyone<00:02:56.760> else<00:02:56.940> and<00:02:57.180> you<00:02:57.690> know<00:02:57.810> not

kind of like the reason i paid the game

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.770 
kind of like the reason i paid the game
to<00:03:01.890> be<00:03:01.980> kind<00:03:02.190> of<00:03:02.250> thrown<00:03:02.910> into<00:03:02.940> the<00:03:03.330> story<00:03:03.600> that

receiving a trilogy pack at some point
or<00:04:09.780> another<00:04:10.130> anyway<00:04:11.130> he<00:04:11.370> was<00:04:11.489> gone<00:04:11.730> on<00:04:11.880> to<00:04:12.060> say

or another anyway he was gone on to say

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.229 
or another anyway he was gone on to say
that<00:04:12.299> the<00:04:12.570> Wii<00:04:12.750> U<00:04:12.959> console<00:04:13.620> is<00:04:14.030> we<00:04:15.030> really

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
that the Wii U console is we really

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.330 
that the Wii U console is we really
feels<00:04:15.510> really<00:04:15.600> cool<00:04:15.900> and<00:04:16.260> the<00:04:16.769> more<00:04:17.040> mass

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
feels really cool and the more mass

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.050 
feels really cool and the more mass
effect<00:04:17.760> would<00:04:18.510> look<00:04:18.870> great<00:04:19.109> on<00:04:19.260> it<00:04:19.739> so<00:04:20.340> we<00:04:20.940> do

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
effect would look great on it so we do

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.120 
effect would look great on it so we do
have<00:04:21.090> plans<00:04:21.390> for<00:04:21.810> the<00:04:21.900> Wii<00:04:22.049> U<00:04:22.260> but<00:04:22.560> nothing<00:04:22.919> to

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
have plans for the Wii U but nothing to

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.080 
have plans for the Wii U but nothing to
announce<00:04:23.280> at<00:04:23.520> the<00:04:23.700> mo

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
announce at the mo

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.570 
announce at the mo
so<00:04:24.780> it's<00:04:24.930> actually<00:04:25.169> pretty<00:04:25.320> cool<00:04:25.560> it's<00:04:26.460> not

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
so it's actually pretty cool it's not

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.030 
so it's actually pretty cool it's not
really<00:04:26.790> surprised<00:04:27.300> that<00:04:27.560> some<00:04:28.560> of<00:04:28.680> the<00:04:28.770> stuff

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
really surprised that some of the stuff

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.409 
really surprised that some of the stuff
it's<00:04:29.310> not<00:04:29.430> really<00:04:29.669> surprised<00:04:30.030> that<00:04:30.180> for

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
it's not really surprised that for

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:32.060 
it's not really surprised that for
example<00:04:30.480> mass<00:04:30.930> effect<00:04:31.290> 4<00:04:31.380> is<00:04:31.710> going<00:04:31.889> to<00:04:31.949> take

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
example mass effect 4 is going to take

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.280 
example mass effect 4 is going to take
so<00:04:32.250> long<00:04:32.430> to<00:04:32.610> release<00:04:32.780> likely<00:04:33.780> of<00:04:33.870> course<00:04:34.080> it's

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
so long to release likely of course it's

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.409 
so long to release likely of course it's
not<00:04:34.440> going<00:04:34.560> to<00:04:34.710> say<00:04:34.919> on<00:04:35.070> the<00:04:35.160> xbox<00:04:35.520> 360<00:04:35.970> or<00:04:36.120> ps4

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
not going to say on the xbox 360 or ps4

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.540 
not going to say on the xbox 360 or ps4
is<00:04:36.720> so<00:04:37.110> a<00:04:37.199> ps3<00:04:37.560> it's<00:04:37.979> probably<00:04:38.190> going<00:04:38.310> to<00:04:38.370> be<00:04:38.430> on

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
is so a ps3 it's probably going to be on

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.340 
is so a ps3 it's probably going to be on
the<00:04:38.940> ps4<00:04:39.180> or<00:04:39.780> indeed<00:04:40.770> on<00:04:41.180> say<00:04:42.180> the<00:04:42.360> xbox<00:04:42.690> 360

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
the ps4 or indeed on say the xbox 360

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:44.629 
the ps4 or indeed on say the xbox 360
and<00:04:43.440> upwards<00:04:43.830> the<00:04:43.979> next<00:04:44.190> generation<00:04:44.610> of

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
and upwards the next generation of

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:47.450

consoles<00:04:45.199> who<00:04:46.199> knows<00:04:46.410> if<00:04:46.590> is<00:04:46.710> going<00:04:46.919> to<00:04:46.979> end<00:04:47.280> up

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
consoles who knows if is going to end up

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.120 
consoles who knows if is going to end up
being<00:04:47.790> a<00:04:47.850> master<00:04:48.180> fit<00:04:48.419> for<00:04:48.660> vertu<00:04:49.320> on<00:04:49.560> the<00:04:49.979> wii

being a master fit for vertu on the wii

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:51.379 
being a master fit for vertu on the wii
u<00:04:50.340> maybe<00:04:50.669> they're<00:04:50.850> talking<00:04:50.970> about<00:04:51.180> an

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
u maybe they're talking about an

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:53.120 
u maybe they're talking about an
entirely<00:04:51.690> separate<00:04:52.169> project<00:04:52.650> who<00:04:52.860> the<00:04:52.979> heck

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
entirely separate project who the heck

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.790 
entirely separate project who the heck
knows<00:04:53.160> it<00:04:54.150> will<00:04:54.300> also<00:04:54.479> be<00:04:54.840> interesting<00:04:55.440> to<00:04:55.590> see

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
knows it will also be interesting to see

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.469 
knows it will also be interesting to see
just<00:04:56.040> what<00:04:56.310> they<00:04:56.520> do<00:04:56.580> with<00:04:56.940> that<00:04:57.090> level<00:04:57.300> of

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 
just what they do with that level of

00:04:57.479 --> 00:04:59.270 
just what they do with that level of
technology<00:04:57.930> and<00:04:58.350> upward<00:04:58.590> seen<00:04:58.770> at<00:04:58.919> the<00:04:58.950> power

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
technology and upward seen at the power

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.909 
technology and upward seen at the power
of<00:04:59.490> those<00:04:59.639> consoles<00:05:00.270> and<00:05:00.660> of<00:05:01.320> course<00:05:01.590> that

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
of those consoles and of course that

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.820 
of those consoles and of course that
would<00:05:02.400> go<00:05:02.940> on<00:05:02.970> to<00:05:03.270> say<00:05:03.510> with<00:05:03.660> the<00:05:03.810> pc<00:05:04.470> versions

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
would go on to say with the pc versions

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.159 
would go on to say with the pc versions
of<00:05:04.919> the<00:05:05.040> game<00:05:05.070> as<00:05:05.430> well<00:05:05.639> as<00:05:06.600> you<00:05:06.750> guys<00:05:06.870> might

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
of the game as well as you guys might

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:10.010 
of the game as well as you guys might
know<00:05:07.380> it<00:05:07.410> uses<00:05:07.860> Unreal<00:05:08.490> Engine<00:05:08.700> as<00:05:09.180> its<00:05:09.720> core

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
know it uses Unreal Engine as its core

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.659 
know it uses Unreal Engine as its core
so<00:05:10.380> I'll<00:05:10.470> be<00:05:10.620> very<00:05:10.830> interesting<00:05:11.310> how<00:05:11.610> that

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 
so I'll be very interesting how that

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:14.000 
so I'll be very interesting how that

unreal<00:05:14.520> tech<00:05:14.910> demos<00:05:15.419> if<00:05:15.870> those<00:05:16.080> guys<00:05:16.380> are

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
unreal tech demos if those guys are

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.260 
unreal tech demos if those guys are
using<00:05:16.740> that<00:05:17.010> as<00:05:17.220> the<00:05:17.250> base<00:05:17.550> of<00:05:17.729> the<00:05:17.850> system<00:05:18.210> I

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
using that as the base of the system I

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:19.100 
using that as the base of the system I
have<00:05:18.389> a<00:05:18.419> feeling<00:05:18.720> it's<00:05:18.810> going<00:05:18.930> to<00:05:19.020> be<00:05:19.080> very

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
have a feeling it's going to be very

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.469 
have a feeling it's going to be very
impressive<00:05:19.919> to<00:05:20.010> say<00:05:20.160> the<00:05:20.190> least<00:05:20.370> not<00:05:21.300> to

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
impressive to say the least not to

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:23.840 
impressive to say the least not to
mention<00:05:21.660> the<00:05:21.930> fact<00:05:22.139> obviously<00:05:22.830> if<00:05:23.100> it's<00:05:23.639> going

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
mention the fact obviously if it's going

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.279 
mention the fact obviously if it's going
to<00:05:23.910> be<00:05:24.000> on<00:05:24.090> those<00:05:24.210> systems<00:05:24.630> of<00:05:24.810> what<00:05:24.960> so<00:05:25.139> much

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:25.289 
to be on those systems of what so much

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:27.050 
to be on those systems of what so much
more<00:05:25.440> when<00:05:25.680> we<00:05:25.860> play<00:05:26.130> when<00:05:26.370> I<00:05:26.460> don't<00:05:26.699> just<00:05:26.880> mean

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
more when we play when I don't just mean

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.330 
more when we play when I don't just mean
system<00:05:27.990> physical<00:05:28.350> RAM<00:05:28.620> obviously<00:05:29.190> on<00:05:29.310> a

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
to be so much more conversation options

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.260 
to be so much more conversation options
so<00:05:34.020> much<00:05:34.139> better<00:05:34.350> textures<00:05:34.979> are<00:05:35.250> so<00:05:36.060> much<00:05:36.240> more

so much better textures are so much more

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.830 
so much better textures are so much more
cool<00:05:36.720> stuff<00:05:36.900> they<00:05:37.169> doing<00:05:37.590> the<00:05:37.710> galaxy<00:05:38.840> anyway
