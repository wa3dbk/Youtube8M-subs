in which they are going to be installed

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.970

keep<00:00:36.300> in<00:00:36.390> mind<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:36.660> this<00:00:36.899> tool<00:00:37.230> does<00:00:37.260> nothing

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
keep in mind that this tool does nothing

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.220 
keep in mind that this tool does nothing
more<00:00:38.219> than<00:00:38.430> just<00:00:38.730> simply<00:00:39.090> taking<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.989> files

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
more than just simply taking the files

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.110 
more than just simply taking the files
from<00:00:40.500> for<00:00:40.829> example<00:00:41.190> seems<00:00:41.370> like<00:00:41.610> third<00:00:41.910> mode

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
from for example seems like third mode

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.959 
from for example seems like third mode
and<00:00:42.440> putting<00:00:43.440> them<00:00:43.559> into<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.100> jar<00:00:44.399> copying

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
and putting them into the jar copying

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.150 
and putting them into the jar copying
them<00:00:45.090> in<00:00:45.300> just<00:00:45.809> like<00:00:45.960> we<00:00:46.079> do<00:00:46.230> by<00:00:46.379> hand<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.800> then

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
them in just like we do by hand and then

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.590 
them in just like we do by hand and then
takes<00:00:47.430> all<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.700> files<00:00:47.879> from<00:00:48.030> my<00:00:48.210> model<00:00:48.390> and

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
takes all the files from my model and

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.510 
takes all the files from my model and
copies<00:00:48.989> all<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.320> files<00:00:49.530> into<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.980> jar<00:00:50.340> and

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
copies all the files into the jar and

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.189 
copies all the files into the jar and
overriding<00:00:50.940> existing<00:00:51.539> files<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.949> on<00:00:53.100> so

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
overriding existing files and so on so

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:56.510 
overriding existing files and so on so
this<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.379> just<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.770> tool<00:00:55.980> for<00:00:56.160> people<00:00:56.430> who

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
this is just the tool for people who

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.090 
this is just the tool for people who
were<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.879> do<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.090> by<00:00:57.239> hand<00:00:57.449> but<00:00:57.809> too<00:00:58.530> lazy<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.980> do

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
were to do it by hand but too lazy to do

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.099 
were to do it by hand but too lazy to do
it<00:00:59.129> really<00:00:59.579> completely<00:01:00.030> by<00:01:00.270> themselves<00:01:00.420> by

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
it really completely by themselves by

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.039 
it really completely by themselves by
hand<00:01:01.320> if<00:01:02.270> you<00:01:03.270> need<00:01:03.420> something<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:04.019> can

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
hand if you need something that can

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.830 
hand if you need something that can
check<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.710> compatibility<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.790> see<00:01:06.570> if<00:01:06.689> there

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
check the compatibility and see if there

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.289 
check the compatibility and see if there
are<00:01:06.930> problems<00:01:07.110> with<00:01:07.439> in<00:01:07.680> watts<00:01:08.150> then<00:01:09.150> need

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
are problems with in watts then need

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.960 
are problems with in watts then need
some<00:01:09.570> like<00:01:10.049> magic<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:10.979> recommend<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.790> use<00:01:11.939> a

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
some like magic and I recommend to use a

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.929 
some like magic and I recommend to use a
proper<00:01:12.270> launcher<00:01:12.600> for<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.900> or<00:01:13.700> maybe<00:01:14.700> some

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
proper launcher for that or maybe some

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.429 
proper launcher for that or maybe some
kind<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.180> lower<00:01:15.420> which<00:01:15.810> can<00:01:16.080> handle<00:01:16.350> that

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
kind of lower which can handle that

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.980 
kind of lower which can handle that
stuff<00:01:16.710> better<00:01:16.860> this<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.670> not<00:01:18.090> intent<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.840> be<00:01:18.960> a

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
stuff better this is not intent to be a

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.719 
stuff better this is not intent to be a
launch<00:01:19.290> or<00:01:19.560> loader<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:20.040> some<00:01:20.250> kind<00:01:20.490> it's

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
launch or loader of some kind it's

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.330 
launch or loader of some kind it's
really<00:01:21.119> just<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.479> tool<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:22.409> make<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.770> easier<00:01:23.130> to

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
really just a tool to make it easier to

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.859 
really just a tool to make it easier to
change<00:01:24.060> stuff<00:01:24.420> by<00:01:24.750> hand<00:01:25.080> okay<00:01:26.720> also<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:27.780> know

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
change stuff by hand okay also I know

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.569 
change stuff by hand okay also I know
that<00:01:28.110> many<00:01:28.290> people<00:01:28.560> had<00:01:28.650> problems<00:01:28.860> with<00:01:29.310> my

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
that many people had problems with my

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.819 
that many people had problems with my
program<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:31.159> apparently<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.400> can't<00:01:32.820> fix<00:01:33.000> it

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
program and apparently I can't fix it

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:37.670 
program and apparently I can't fix it
sorry<00:01:35.060> but<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.390> included<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:36.960> source<00:01:37.290> code<00:01:37.500> for

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
sorry but I included the source code for

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.980 
sorry but I included the source code for
my<00:01:37.799> program<00:01:38.040> in<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.400> description<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.150> if<00:01:39.479> you

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
my program in the description so if you

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.690 
my program in the description so if you
know<00:01:40.110> what<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.320> change<00:01:40.590> feel<00:01:41.220> free<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.520> just

know what to change feel free to just
take<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.060> source<00:01:42.270> code<00:01:42.420> change<00:01:42.750> for<00:01:42.990> yourself

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
take the source code change for yourself

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.139 
take the source code change for yourself
and<00:01:43.560> if<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:44.250> want<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.490> use<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:44.790> for<00:01:44.820> something
