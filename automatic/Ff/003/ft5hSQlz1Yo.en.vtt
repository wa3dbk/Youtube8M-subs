flash<00:02:16.850> hider<00:02:17.180> I<00:02:17.710> took<00:02:18.710> off<00:02:18.890> his<00:02:19.069> old<00:02:19.310> outer

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
flash hider I took off his old outer

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.200 
flash hider I took off his old outer
barrel<00:02:20.000> and<00:02:20.450> I<00:02:21.410> put<00:02:21.650> on<00:02:21.770> my<00:02:21.890> CS<00:02:22.640> flash<00:02:22.910> hider

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
barrel and I put on my CS flash hider

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.559 
barrel and I put on my CS flash hider
and<00:02:23.540> then<00:02:24.410> I<00:02:24.440> put<00:02:24.710> the<00:02:24.830> sound<00:02:25.069> server<00:02:25.430> that

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
and then I put the sound server that

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.520 
and then I put the sound server that
overall<00:02:26.569> fits<00:02:26.930> really<00:02:27.350> really<00:02:28.070> well<00:02:28.450> and

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
overall fits really really well and

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.390 
overall fits really really well and
really<00:02:30.530> nice<00:02:30.710> look<00:02:30.920> for<00:02:31.070> the<00:02:31.190> gun<00:02:31.340> I<00:02:31.370> think<00:02:31.730> he

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
really nice look for the gun I think he

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.210 
really nice look for the gun I think he

already learning up I think about 20
shots<00:03:59.420> these<00:04:00.420> are<00:04:00.660> standard<00:04:01.230> thirty<00:04:01.440> round

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680
