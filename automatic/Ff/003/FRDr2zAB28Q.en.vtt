00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:08.330
 hello dear friends we are glad you 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.809
 welcome center to our site 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:15.150
 distance events academy of growth 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:18.830
 in this video, I'll show you how 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.449
 prepare properly loading work 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:25.080
 such questions often come in 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:28.230
 it turns out to load work with what it is 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.420
 happens communication happens so participants 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.380
 print out all the quiz assignments and 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.530
 perform and 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.750
 printed out then scan or 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.920
 take pictures and get some 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.079
 here such separate files 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.050
 removing work you can download only one 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.670
 file and arises from with this problem like 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:55.710
 upload 6 files 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:58.320
 there are two ways to boot first is all 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:03.620
 files move the Word document 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.620
 for this we open a lot of document and 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:17.960
 just copy each of our drawing on 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.600
 next leaf 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:29.450
 inserting the sides have 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:32.070
 copy and so on 70 in order 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:36.170
 then we just have to close until 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.170
 was save it 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.340
 assigned job logs 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:56.630
 saves here we have 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:02:02.399
 you can freely upload it to the site 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:07.740
 The second option is to collect all the sheets in 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:09.720
 one can collect all the sheets into one 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:14.120
 folder for this right-click 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:24.150
 create a folder we have a bid which 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:26.330
 immediately renamed work and all sheets 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.489
 we move to this folder 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:33.569
 I know 5 under us just so not 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:39.019
 boot we need this approach 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:39.019
 archive for this add to archive 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.630
 here we already have an archive and now 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.930
 with this archive we add it to 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.690
 scuffle work 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:55.530
 Further, regarding the tasks where necessary 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:58.140
 paint something more often here 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:02.160
 such tasks where you need to paint either 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:04.769
 go through the maze if you have 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.730
 such a task you can print 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:11.280
 just the drawing itself 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:14.150
 paint it cook what's the task 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.570
 Donat and then 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:23.519
 the quiz that you downloaded in the task 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:27.750
 the answer is given here 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:34.260
 the end here is a drawing we have this drawing 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:36.690
 remove and add your scanned 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:44.299
 or photographed drawing also 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:48.359
 copy paste the picture we put 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:53.449
 our work is ready to save changes 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:53.449
 and upload to the site 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:04.260
 there are also such issues related to 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:09.390
 so that I wanted to clarify the moment too 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:17.700
 in order to cut you down 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:20.760
 we must go into the document here with us 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:23.040
 there is a picture scanned 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:26.040
 photographing the whole picture is enough 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.950
 many and add to work are not needed 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:32.030
 megabytes we have an allowable amount 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:34.970
 uploading works to the site effective gabay 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.260
 in order to match the volume 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:41.310
 is necessary 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:44.060
 Here we charge and the drawing itself 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:47.100
 window opened squeeze pictures 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.200
 can all select all drawing 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.650
 documents can only you apply 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.510
 conference at least without drawing 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.890
 we will be if we choose for the Internet 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:03.860
 and screens 96 dpi 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:07.560
 further click all we applied compression 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:14.790
 now close work and save and 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:19.729
 change we can see what volume 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:25.919
 work has decreased to 300 41 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:28.770
 kilobyte this volume is very small and 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:29.880
 the work is fine uploaded to the site than 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.830
 less work 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.830
 samana will be free to load 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:41.850
 similarly we do presentations here at 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.830
 we have a presentation volume which 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:48.510
 exceeds 10 megabytes 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:50.030
 in order for us to open it click 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:54.090
 on drawing 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:58.800
 we have twice opened analogs 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:06:02.400
 begin to laugh and push pictures 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:05.599
 we can only apply or decide 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.790
 all figures at once parameters 

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:08.500
 electra 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:13.320
 on mail here we select the most 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:16.680
 minimum size and click ok yes 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.680
 again 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:37.390
 This is then closed save 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:41.430
 changed and we can see with you that 

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:45.340
 we had a lot of work 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:48.340
 12 megabytes at all that's 5 that's also 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:52.060
 the amount of work we have is fine 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:53.320
 upload to the site thank you very much 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:57.010
