00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 welcome to the new group ex the first of 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.750
 this week is pinocchio of damage 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.099
 to understand this is what he did 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.830
 seagull and the cat the arrow 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.780
 blue what he brought forward 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.089
 traditional animation here in Italy 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.340
 the film is not only Italian but in 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.470
 collaboration with france and belgium 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.480
 I believe that it is also because the study 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.970
 who had he been shut we believe 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.939
 who reopened it for this movie has 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.410
 closed for excessive expenses compared to 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.189
 film earnings 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.170
 that's why I don't know how much of the 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.059
 film has been made in Italy too 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.399
 why belgium and france france 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.190
 above all it is a leader in Europe 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.260
 in traditional animation I don't 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.120
 I would stop and nothing else but dpa at 3 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.920
 minutes of review 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.899
 regarding the realization 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.000
 I found it very beautiful and dreamy 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.440
 scenarios are all pastel shapes 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.309
 some places are very well studied 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.559
 think 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.360
 and the colors make the feelings very i 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.859
 heavens that suddenly become dark 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.090
 and rainy give strong sensations 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.680
 visual 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.719
 some scenes are really very beautiful 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.280
 from the lines like when turquoise appears 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.170
 in the dust under water to help 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.970
 pinocchio pity that there are not 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.010
 pause a little longer in this too 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.170
 film as a souvenir for the gabbianella e 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.150
 the cat inserted a piece with gods 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.009
 most raw traits that played with the 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.229
 transformation of color shapes and 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.180
 the sensations a sort of solo 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.189
 virtuosic even if I have to say not 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.409
 emotionally inserted as well as 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.509
 in the cage in the story is a real one 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.549
 mess is not ugly and but it is a 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.840
 disaster is in pinocchio is more related to 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.710
 it in the original of what it has 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.659
 never seen 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.130
 and this works in favor of the film by 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.290
 against to put some product have 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.729
 course as one of the first ten 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.229
 minutes of film we do not come geppetto 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.119
 young people already said that it gets old 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.040
 already said that pinocchio is great that 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.689
 runs away from home already said that ends in 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.440
 messes at the top even at home alone 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.360
 with a disaster 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.770
 the event that returns home until 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.060
 absolutely wants from school up 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.700
 friends to make happy the father will go 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.820
 definitely in school a little quick 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.110
 in short a real pity since not from 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.910
 time for the viewer to enter 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.640
 harmony with the characters and to grasp 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.400
 the emotionality of the situations started in 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.360
 merchandise track go on changes the 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.250
 situation 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.050
 the songs are of lucio from and are 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.150
 well inserted pleasing and do not weigh 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.560
 also because they almost never exceed 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.290
 minute except for one particular case 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.360
 in the blue house where the song 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.100
 bomb part without warning and with 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.080
 tools out of context and with a 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.490
 displaced audio balance i 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.680
 characters as for the scenarios are 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.150
 very studied following the lines 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.220
 typically illustrative plus 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.170
 animation and animation is not 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.970
 made to love as I thought, except for some 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.340
 ran lived to be evaluated in characters yes 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.170
 they move with a speed is real and it is 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.170
 she cries as well and was quite well done 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.790
 except in a few special cases 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.680
 voice actor was not bad 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.810
 in conclusion I was very happy 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.610
 to see a high quality and push 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.050
 on the artist coming out of Italy 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.489
 however, as already mentioned, one must understand 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.739
 how much has come out of Italy since 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.810
 go gefran usa sin that little care 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.489
 of the strand to the excellent stronchi of much 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.770
 the audience to which it is dedicated 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.600
 the film reducing the band 6 10 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.280
 probably due to a strong desire to 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.090
 stay tied down as much as possible yesterday 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.040
 collodi 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.810
 however I find a lot more versions from 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.489
 an author among sensations sharks 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.680
 emotions and the message that I'm fine 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.959
 rather than dry events that 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.880
 book tells a film without a doubt 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.650
 delivered to the little ones but of most 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.230
 large is interesting perhaps only 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.390
 who wants to draw an interest 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.640
 style and italic criticism 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.890
 novel that gives then unite surrender 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.110
 quality and texture and evaluating it for the 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:32.629
 age group to which the vote is addressed 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:34.430
 this movie and I risked not 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:36.860
 see the film because there was snow and 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.230
 beastly wind practically the snow 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.299
 that is, it came horizontally directly 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:46.659
 open the window and get to the bottom 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:49.370
 the living room or look looks between you 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:53.030
 he would run for the month of August 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.940
 moreover, fortunately, the passes 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:04:00.410
 I went to the cinema with alex 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:02.239
 hot impressions there is no one to 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.340
 you saw it they took us to the 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:05.660
 nephew let me know what you think 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.700
 leaving a comment 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.700
 See you at the next fax
