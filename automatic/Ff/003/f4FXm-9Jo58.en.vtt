together you generally want to attack an
enemy<00:02:32.519> and<00:02:32.910> then<00:02:33.090> use<00:02:33.239> a<00:02:33.269> skill<00:02:33.599> to<00:02:33.750> defend

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.210 
enemy and then use a skill to defend
yourself<00:02:36.410> after<00:02:37.410> you<00:02:37.470> successfully<00:02:38.040> done

that you then attack it again and then

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.410 
that you then attack it again and then
here's<00:02:40.860> another<00:02:41.069> defensive<00:02:41.580> skill<00:02:41.849> and<00:02:42.090> keep
