lines up with the the keyboard

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.119 
lines up with the the keyboard

a<00:02:25.659> little<00:02:25.870> bit<00:02:25.959> of<00:02:26.049> an<00:02:26.139> adjustment<00:02:26.499> if<00:02:26.769> you're

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
a little bit of an adjustment if you're

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.379 
a little bit of an adjustment if you're
you<00:02:27.430> know<00:02:27.519> there's<00:02:27.700> not<00:02:27.790> a<00:02:27.849> whole<00:02:27.909> lot<00:02:28.000> cases

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:28.389 
you know there's not a whole lot cases

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:29.459 
you know there's not a whole lot cases

all-around protection there's nothing on
this<00:02:35.530> screen<00:02:35.769> but<00:02:35.920> if<00:02:36.010> you<00:02:36.129> have<00:02:36.250> this<00:02:36.459> screen

to go and it does have a nice feel to it

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.140 
to go and it does have a nice feel to it
it<00:02:42.579> looks<00:02:42.819> kind<00:02:43.030> of<00:02:43.060> cool<00:02:43.239> too<00:02:44.459> but<00:02:45.459> it's<00:02:45.639> just

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
it looks kind of cool too but it's just

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.909 
it looks kind of cool too but it's just
interesting<00:02:46.750> all<00:02:47.230> around<00:02:47.439> the<00:02:47.560> only<00:02:47.739> thing

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:47.919 
interesting all around the only thing

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:49.170 
interesting all around the only thing
that<00:02:48.069> you<00:02:48.280> know<00:02:48.400> looks<00:02:48.609> kind<00:02:48.760> of<00:02:48.849> odd<00:02:49.000> is<00:02:49.150> the

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
that you know looks kind of odd is the

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.000 
that you know looks kind of odd is the
way<00:02:49.359> the<00:02:49.480> trackpad<00:02:49.719> sits<00:02:50.139> in<00:02:50.290> there<00:02:50.439> so<00:02:50.919> if

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
way the trackpad sits in there so if

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.409 
way the trackpad sits in there so if
you're<00:02:51.189> you<00:02:51.459> know<00:02:51.549> you're<00:02:51.669> super<00:02:51.819> big<00:02:52.150> on<00:02:52.299> the

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
aesthetics of it it's gonna throw off a

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.509 
aesthetics of it it's gonna throw off a
little<00:02:54.760> bit<00:02:54.879> but<00:02:55.180> overall<00:02:56.049> I'm<00:02:57.010> a<00:02:57.099> pretty<00:02:57.340> big
