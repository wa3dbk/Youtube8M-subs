something<00:00:12.170> to<00:00:12.350> build<00:00:12.530> on<00:00:12.710> logs<00:00:13.100> whatever<00:00:13.760> but

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.030 
something to build on logs whatever but

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.840 
something to build on logs whatever but
that<00:00:14.240> won't<00:00:14.510> last<00:00:14.540> forever<00:00:14.900> oh<00:00:15.260> good<00:00:15.800> you<00:00:16.730> know

that won't last forever oh good you know
logs<00:00:17.120> can<00:00:17.360> rot<00:00:17.570> and<00:00:17.750> fall<00:00:17.870> park<00:00:18.140> with<00:00:18.320> it<00:00:18.610> it'll

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:19.610 
logs can rot and fall park with it it'll

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.640 
logs can rot and fall park with it it'll
last<00:00:19.820> a<00:00:20.000> long<00:00:20.090> time<00:00:20.150> right<00:00:20.630> so<00:00:21.380> what<00:00:21.530> you're

last a long time right so what you're
going<00:00:21.740> to<00:00:21.800> want<00:00:21.920> to<00:00:22.010> do<00:00:22.100> to<00:00:22.190> build<00:00:22.310> your<00:00:22.430> brand

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:22.520 
going to want to do to build your brand

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.529 
going to want to do to build your brand
is<00:00:22.789> get<00:00:23.090> dirt<00:00:23.360> and<00:00:24.130> find<00:00:25.130> a<00:00:25.400> good<00:00:25.610> curve<00:00:26.060> to<00:00:26.390> go

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
is get dirt and find a good curve to go

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.230 
is get dirt and find a good curve to go
with<00:00:26.779> like<00:00:27.080> one<00:00:28.039> time<00:00:28.279> I<00:00:28.580> built<00:00:28.880> the<00:00:28.970> dirt<00:00:29.119> ramp

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
with like one time I built the dirt ramp

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.849 
with like one time I built the dirt ramp
he<00:00:29.420> went<00:00:29.600> to<00:00:29.660> a<00:00:29.720> skate<00:00:29.990> park<00:00:30.020> and<00:00:30.470> we<00:00:30.529> measured

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
he went to a skate park and we measured

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.069 
he went to a skate park and we measured
out<00:00:31.239> this<00:00:32.239> is<00:00:32.359> one<00:00:32.509> way<00:00:32.599> you<00:00:32.629> can<00:00:32.780> do<00:00:32.899> it<00:00:32.989> you

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
out this is one way you can do it you

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:34.510 
out this is one way you can do it you
measure<00:00:33.260> out<00:00:33.530> from<00:00:33.770> there<00:00:33.980> to<00:00:34.100> the<00:00:34.220> base<00:00:34.370> of

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
measure out from there to the base of

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.190 
measure out from there to the base of
the<00:00:34.579> jump<00:00:34.820> and<00:00:35.030> then<00:00:35.480> from<00:00:35.780> there<00:00:35.930> the<00:00:36.050> base

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
the jump and then from there the base

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
the jump and then from there the base
there<00:00:36.410> to<00:00:36.470> the<00:00:36.560> base<00:00:36.680> there<00:00:36.890> to<00:00:36.980> the<00:00:37.070> base

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
there to the base there to the base

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.160 
there to the base there to the base
right<00:00:37.730> and<00:00:37.970> you<00:00:38.060> get<00:00:38.210> the<00:00:38.360> UM<00:00:38.480> angle<00:00:38.840> the<00:00:38.930> jump

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
right and you get the UM angle the jump

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.380 
right and you get the UM angle the jump
or<00:00:39.350> you<00:00:39.890> can<00:00:40.010> just<00:00:40.100> kind<00:00:40.340> of<00:00:40.430> build<00:00:40.940> something

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
or you can just kind of build something

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.160 
or you can just kind of build something
ride<00:00:41.870> it<00:00:41.899> change<00:00:42.320> it<00:00:42.530> right<00:00:42.680> it<00:00:43.430> change<00:00:43.670> it<00:00:43.880> and

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
ride it change it right it change it and

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.560 
ride it change it right it change it and
you<00:00:45.170> just<00:00:45.320> scoop<00:00:45.739> up<00:00:46.010> the<00:00:46.070> jump<00:00:46.550> like<00:00:46.790> like

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
you just scoop up the jump like like

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:48.850 
you just scoop up the jump like like
he's<00:00:47.809> doing<00:00:48.050> right<00:00:48.170> now<00:00:48.320> you<00:00:48.380> scoop<00:00:48.710> up<00:00:48.829> the

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
he's doing right now you scoop up the

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.310 
he's doing right now you scoop up the
jump<00:00:49.219> make<00:00:49.910> it<00:00:50.059> nice<00:00:50.239> and<00:00:50.570> smooth<00:00:50.960> and<00:00:51.079> glossy

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
jump make it nice and smooth and glossy

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.680 
jump make it nice and smooth and glossy

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
want to do is I'll pound it down a

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.080 
want to do is I'll pound it down a
little<00:00:56.809> bit<00:00:57.020> when<00:00:57.440> she's<00:00:57.590> going<00:00:57.710> to<00:00:57.770> do<00:00:57.860> now

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
little bit when she's going to do now

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.729 
little bit when she's going to do now

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
glossy look and then something else I

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.440 
glossy look and then something else I
recommend<00:01:10.130> for<00:01:10.340> jumps<00:01:10.670> just<00:01:10.909> so<00:01:11.030> it<00:01:11.119> looks<00:01:11.270> so

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
recommend for jumps just so it looks so

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.359 
recommend for jumps just so it looks so
much<00:01:11.600> cooler<00:01:11.900> like<00:01:12.560> this<00:01:12.740> was<00:01:12.950> just<00:01:13.190> a<00:01:13.250> big

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
much cooler like this was just a big

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:14.620 
much cooler like this was just a big
pile<00:01:13.549> of<00:01:13.580> dirt<00:01:13.729> we're<00:01:14.030> sculpting<00:01:14.270> it<00:01:14.510> right

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
pile of dirt we're sculpting it right

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.350 
pile of dirt we're sculpting it right
now<00:01:14.780> is<00:01:14.960> um<00:01:15.670> this<00:01:16.670> is<00:01:16.820> definitely<00:01:17.119> gonna<00:01:17.210> be

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
now is um this is definitely gonna be

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.510 
now is um this is definitely gonna be
like<00:01:17.540> a<00:01:17.780> lot<00:01:18.260> higher<00:01:18.530> to<00:01:18.950> match<00:01:19.100> other<00:01:19.340> that

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
like a lot higher to match other that

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.140 
like a lot higher to match other that
box<00:01:19.760> that's<00:01:20.689> like<00:01:20.930> back<00:01:21.350> foot<00:01:21.770> so<00:01:22.250> cut<00:01:22.850> it<00:01:22.880> and

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
box that's like back foot so cut it and

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.179 
box that's like back foot so cut it and
make<00:01:23.330> it<00:01:23.360> look<00:01:23.630> like<00:01:24.200> a<00:01:24.260> wall<00:01:24.619> and<00:01:24.830> once<00:01:25.040> it

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
make it look like a wall and once it

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:26.350 
make it look like a wall and once it
gets<00:01:25.310> up<00:01:25.490> there<00:01:25.610> we'll<00:01:25.790> put<00:01:25.909> a<00:01:25.939> picture<00:01:26.150> at<00:01:26.299> the

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
gets up there we'll put a picture at the

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.429 
gets up there we'll put a picture at the
end<00:01:26.479> of<00:01:26.540> this<00:01:26.600> video<00:01:26.750> once<00:01:27.080> we<00:01:27.200> get<00:01:27.290> it

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
end of this video once we get it

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:29.770 
end of this video once we get it
remotely<00:01:28.159> done<00:01:28.430> it's<00:01:28.700> about<00:01:28.880> to<00:01:29.030> be<00:01:29.180> time<00:01:29.630> for

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
remotely done it's about to be time for

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.899 
remotely done it's about to be time for
me<00:01:29.840> to<00:01:29.930> go<00:01:30.020> home<00:01:30.049> so<00:01:30.560> I'm<00:01:31.369> just<00:01:31.549> going<00:01:31.670> to<00:01:31.759> put<00:01:31.820> a

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
me to go home so I'm just going to put a
