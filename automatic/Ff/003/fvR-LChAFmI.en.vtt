00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.020 
challenge I think they'll just cut this
whole<00:04:45.100> section<00:04:45.490> out<00:04:45.670> because<00:04:45.790> they're<00:04:45.910> like<00:04:46.000> I

because<00:04:52.630> I<00:04:52.750> used<00:04:52.900> to<00:04:52.930> be<00:04:53.020> a<00:04:53.050> lot<00:04:53.260> buffer<00:04:53.590> when<00:04:53.710> I

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
because I used to be a lot buffer when I

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.230 
because I used to be a lot buffer when I
used<00:04:53.890> to<00:04:53.950> swim<00:04:54.130> if<00:04:54.280> I<00:04:54.370> do<00:04:54.490> like<00:04:54.670> one<00:04:54.970> hour<00:04:55.120> of

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
definitely think that for check it was

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.860 
definitely think that for check it was
much<00:04:59.620> easier<00:04:59.650> than<00:05:00.490> it<00:05:00.880> was<00:05:01.060> for<00:05:01.390> Chris<00:05:01.630> I<00:05:01.810> mean
