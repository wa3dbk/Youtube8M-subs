00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.150 
again then we get that album artwork
right<00:00:48.420> there<00:00:48.690> we<00:00:48.870> can<00:00:48.989> also<00:00:49.140> pause<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.680> just<00:00:50.039> by

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
right there we can also pause it just by

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.680 
right there we can also pause it just by
tapping<00:00:50.219> on<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:50.940> it's<00:00:51.300> going<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.480> give<00:00:51.600> you

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
tapping on that it's going to give you

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.680 
tapping on that it's going to give you
the<00:00:51.809> pause<00:00:51.989> right<00:00:52.320> there<00:00:53.210> so<00:00:54.210> that's<00:00:54.510> what

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
the pause right there so that's what

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.020 
the pause right there so that's what
classic<00:00:55.079> cut<00:00:55.199> looks<00:00:55.440> like<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:55.890> if<00:00:56.070> we<00:00:56.520> disable

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
classic cut looks like so if we disable

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.700 
classic cut looks like so if we disable
that<00:00:57.360> we<00:00:57.870> don't<00:00:57.930> have<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.170> respring<00:00:58.559> or

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
that we don't have to respring or

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.319 
that we don't have to respring or
anything<00:00:59.010> like<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.250> we<00:00:59.640> can<00:00:59.789> just<00:00:59.940> change<00:01:00.149> it

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
anything like that we can just change it

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.569 
anything like that we can just change it
right<00:01:00.359> over<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.050> modern<00:01:01.410> HUD<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.829> we<00:01:02.430> can

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
right over to the modern HUD and we can

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.460 
right over to the modern HUD and we can
enable<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.090> album<00:01:03.449> artwork<00:01:03.690> as<00:01:03.960> well<00:01:04.170> as<00:01:04.320> the

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
enable the album artwork as well as the

music<00:01:04.619> controls<00:01:05.189> now<00:01:05.369> this<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.729> actually<00:01:05.880> my

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
music controls now this is actually my

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.750 
music controls now this is actually my
preference<00:01:07.350> just<00:01:07.439> because<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.400> can<00:01:08.549> see

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
preference just because you can see

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.490 
preference just because you can see
right<00:01:08.790> up<00:01:09.030> here<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.689> it's<00:01:09.840> actually<00:01:10.229> up<00:01:10.409> in

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
right up here that it's actually up in

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.920 
right up here that it's actually up in
the<00:01:10.560> top<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.760> screen<00:01:11.939> rather<00:01:12.479> than<00:01:12.600> right

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
the top of the screen rather than right

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.719 
the top of the screen rather than right
there<00:01:13.110> in<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.260> middle<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.740> screen<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.549> if

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
there in the middle of the screen so if

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.210 
there in the middle of the screen so if
we<00:01:14.880> turn<00:01:15.479> this<00:01:15.659> up<00:01:15.869> we<00:01:16.080> can<00:01:16.259> obviously<00:01:16.860> pause

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
we turn this up we can obviously pause

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.980 
we turn this up we can obviously pause
it<00:01:18.380> we<00:01:19.380> can<00:01:19.560> play<00:01:19.710> pause<00:01:20.220> just<00:01:20.939> like<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.299> very

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
it we can play pause just like that very

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.570 
it we can play pause just like that very
simple<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.830> can<00:01:22.950> also<00:01:23.070> change<00:01:23.430> the

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
simple you can also change the

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.880 
simple you can also change the
appearance<00:01:24.119> right<00:01:24.450> here<00:01:24.689> for<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.900> modern<00:01:25.560> HUD

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
appearance right here for the modern HUD

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.980 
appearance right here for the modern HUD
so<00:01:26.100> if<00:01:26.189> we<00:01:26.310> tap<00:01:26.520> on<00:01:26.670> this<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:27.270> have<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.479> minimal

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
so if we tap on this you have a minimal

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.780 
so if we tap on this you have a minimal
look<00:01:28.200> which<00:01:28.710> basically<00:01:28.979> just<00:01:29.130> gets<00:01:29.520> rid<00:01:29.759> of

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
look which basically just gets rid of

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.600 
look which basically just gets rid of
the<00:01:30.500> album<00:01:31.500> artwork<00:01:31.740> right<00:01:32.009> there<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.490> can

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
the album artwork right there so you can

that if you have your phone on silent I
like<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.820> bigger<00:01:48.030> one<00:01:48.270> not<00:01:48.810> sure<00:01:48.960> why<00:01:49.200> just<00:01:49.590> do

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
like the bigger one not sure why just do

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.950 
like the bigger one not sure why just do
but<00:01:50.520> down<00:01:50.759> here<00:01:51.090> this<00:01:51.210> is<00:01:51.390> going<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.720> give<00:01:51.840> you

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
but down here this is going to give you

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.600 
but down here this is going to give you
obviously<00:01:52.409> just<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.710> preview<00:01:52.979> of<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.520> can

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
obviously just a preview of it you can

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.700 
obviously just a preview of it you can
also<00:01:53.759> change<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.240> delay<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:55.350> this<00:01:55.530> is

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
also change the delay so this is

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.649 
also change the delay so this is
basically<00:01:55.920> just<00:01:56.250> adjusting<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.270> amount<00:01:57.360> of

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
basically just adjusting the amount of

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.200 
basically just adjusting the amount of
time<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.229> HUD<00:01:58.469> is<00:01:58.680> shown<00:01:59.009> so<00:01:59.640> right<00:01:59.939> now<00:01:59.969> it's

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
time the HUD is shown so right now it's

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.999 
time the HUD is shown so right now it's
at<00:02:00.299> one<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.990> half<00:02:01.020> seconds<00:02:01.649> if<00:02:01.710> we<00:02:01.799> want<00:02:01.950> to

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
at one and a half seconds if we want to

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.319 
at one and a half seconds if we want to
change<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.399> two<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.759> half<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.180> can

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
change it to two and a half and you can

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.940 
change it to two and a half and you can
see<00:02:03.540> it's<00:02:04.110> going<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.290> stay<00:02:04.469> up<00:02:04.500> for<00:02:04.890> another

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
see it's going to stay up for another

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.449 
see it's going to stay up for another
two<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.579> half<00:02:05.759> seconds<00:02:06.799> so<00:02:07.799> that's<00:02:08.220> what

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
two and a half seconds so that's what

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.070 
two and a half seconds so that's what
HUD<00:02:08.700> he<00:02:08.970> does<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.539> it's<00:02:09.629> actually<00:02:09.929> pretty

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
HUD he does and it's actually pretty
