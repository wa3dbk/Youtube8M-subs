00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:10.519
 today I'm going to use this machine to do 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:13.910
 my recipe because if this then this is 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.320
 good if it's a sandwich maker but I'm not going 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.609
 to make sandwiches and what am I going to do 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.609
 now you will see 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:21.749
 I'm going to do 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.260
 I'm going to do 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:43.120
 mini donuts mini flights because it turns out 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:47.190
 which is the machine is 4 and has no plates 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.190
 for sandwiches 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:01:02.090
 waffles and for grill is this idea is 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.110
 for grill 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.110
 and then 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.030
 for waffles 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.790
 and they are interchangeable then 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.810
 I already made a video of the unboxing this 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.590
 machine is mine 4 at least one brand 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.659
 german 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:34.119
 so now what we are going to do is 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.119
 place the plates of the donuts 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:43.430
 and warm it up as you go 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:48.100
 heating while heating is easy 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.100
 put it while it warms up then 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.210
 we will simply prepare the 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.850
 ingredients 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.320
 I already have the recipe in the blog but 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.320
 I wanted to do 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:06.280
 I have already tried all the plants except the 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.280
 d 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.980
 from the grill that good has to go 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.450
 good for forces because it's just heating 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.819
 Y 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:20.709
 and others as very well done and 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:22.300
 waffles and sandwiches and everything very 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:26.830
 all right 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:29.569
 so today I am starting a little bit 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.840
 baking tin 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.519
 today we are going to do 2 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.269
 as a recipe that does not have 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:41.280
 animal ingredients that is going very 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:44.670
 good for vegetarians 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:49.319
 for those who are far away and for people who 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:52.500
 they do not want to take cholesterol because now 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.300
 already plugged it in to warm up and 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.270
 meanwhile let's make the recipe 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.140
 well we need 100 milliliters first 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:03.520
 of 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:05.860
 of vegetable milk or almond milk 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.190
 I do it good and now I eat 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.290
 lake so in the act colors movie maker 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:15.880
 I'll do it if you want 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:18.480
 You can buy or make or make milk 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:22.410
 almonds 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:25.940
 they do not have to be 100 milliliters 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.940
 I'm going to remove a little water 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:34.630
 yes and I already say that you can do it with 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.940
 normal almond milk and then you 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.920
 add a few tablespoons like three of 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:43.320
 chopped belly because what I'm going to 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.320
 use is the almond that is left here 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.340
 the rest will not come almond worth 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.290
 Now the first thing while heating the 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.970
 machine 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.830
 I make milk 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.310
 and it will be made of almonds in sugar 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.310
 you are welcome 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:21.739
 the sun to make for while the 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.739
 ingredients 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.820
 let's give it again 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.820
 and it is already 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.230
 and all this because it's the clean ones 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.230
