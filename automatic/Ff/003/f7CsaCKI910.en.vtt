you want
these<00:00:28.620> strings<00:00:29.010> play<00:00:29.550> open<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.060> few<00:00:30.240> times

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:32.860 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.320 

and<00:00:33.310> it<00:00:33.490> changes<00:00:33.940> to<00:00:34.000> a<00:00:34.150> D<00:00:34.420> minor<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:37.180> way

and it changes to a D minor and the way

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.400 
and it changes to a D minor and the way
you<00:00:37.390> do<00:00:37.690> that<00:00:37.930> is<00:00:38.700> you've<00:00:39.700> got<00:00:39.940> your<00:00:40.270> a<00:00:40.510> minor

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
of the g string and then simply go back

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.160 
of the g string and then simply go back
to<00:01:24.850> the<00:01:24.940> a<00:01:24.970> minor<00:01:25.390> again<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:28.000> lift<00:01:28.750> your

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
to the a minor again so lift your

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.800 
to the a minor again so lift your
fingers<00:01:29.590> up<00:01:29.800> it<00:01:30.009> keep<00:01:30.160> them<00:01:30.250> closed<00:01:30.810> notice

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
fingers up it keep them closed notice

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.389 
fingers up it keep them closed notice
how<00:01:31.960> these<00:01:32.140> two<00:01:32.380> fingers<00:01:32.619> can<00:01:32.950> kind<00:01:33.160> of<00:01:33.220> move

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
how these two fingers can kind of move

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:36.240 
how these two fingers can kind of move
together<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:35.259> can<00:01:35.470> see<00:01:35.680> that<00:01:35.890> they're<00:01:36.220> just

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
together you can see that they're just

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.550 
together you can see that they're just
kind<00:01:36.640> of<00:01:36.729> sliding<00:01:37.180> over<00:01:37.690> there<00:01:37.900> and<00:01:38.170> as<00:01:38.350> you're

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
kind of sliding over there and as you're

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.280 
kind of sliding over there and as you're
doing<00:01:38.680> that<00:01:38.830> this<00:01:39.220> finger<00:01:39.670> is<00:01:40.049> sliding<00:01:41.049> over

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
doing that this finger is sliding over

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.219 
doing that this finger is sliding over
to<00:01:41.440> there<00:01:41.940> so<00:01:42.940> with<00:01:43.120> practice<00:01:43.600> is<00:01:43.840> because<00:01:44.200> of

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
to there so with practice is because of

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.149 
to there so with practice is because of
very<00:01:44.560> smooth<00:01:45.040> and<00:01:45.490> he<00:01:46.180> z<00:01:46.240> maneuver

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.730 

and<00:01:49.399> it<00:01:49.820> a<00:01:50.060> good<00:01:50.359> idea<00:01:50.420> to<00:01:50.749> simply<00:01:51.259> practice

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
and it a good idea to simply practice

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:58.419 
and it a good idea to simply practice
going<00:01:52.549> back<00:01:52.759> and<00:01:52.969> forth<00:01:57.039> then<00:01:58.039> it<00:01:58.219> goes

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
going back and forth then it goes

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:00.099 
going back and forth then it goes
through<00:01:58.729> the<00:01:58.850> E<00:01:58.880> minor<00:01:59.179> chord<00:01:59.390> from<00:01:59.899> the<00:02:00.079> a

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:00.109 
through the E minor chord from the a

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:02.859 
through the E minor chord from the a
minor<00:02:00.500> and<00:02:00.829> this<00:02:00.979> is<00:02:01.130> very<00:02:01.369> simple<00:02:02.179> you<00:02:02.450> simply

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
minor and this is very simple you simply

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.750 
minor and this is very simple you simply
lift<00:02:03.079> these<00:02:03.289> two<00:02:03.500> fingers<00:02:03.950> up

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
lift these two fingers up

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:12.250 
lift these two fingers up
and<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:07.110> place<00:02:07.440> them<00:02:08.900> on<00:02:09.900> the<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:11.070> the<00:02:11.100> D

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
and you place them on the a and the D

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.600 
and you place them on the a and the D
string<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:14.880> lift<00:02:15.060> up<00:02:15.330> your<00:02:15.840> index<00:02:16.170> finger

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
string and you lift up your index finger

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.670 
string and you lift up your index finger
so<00:02:17.610> you'd<00:02:17.880> be<00:02:18.060> going<00:02:18.390> from<00:02:18.570> here

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
so you'd be going from here

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:32.160 
so you'd be going from here
to<00:02:21.680> hear

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:39.100 

as<00:02:33.170> a<00:02:33.320> place<00:02:33.620> in<00:02:33.830> a<00:02:33.920> song<00:02:37.360> it<00:02:38.360> goes<00:02:38.600> from<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.080> a

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
as a place in a song it goes from the a

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:46.780 
as a place in a song it goes from the a
minor<00:02:39.470> to<00:02:39.890> e<00:02:42.910> 7th<00:02:43.910> chord

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.230 

so<00:02:47.790> in<00:02:48.150> that<00:02:48.300> case<00:02:48.600> we<00:02:48.660> go<00:02:49.140> from<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:49.710> minor<00:02:50.240> and

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
so in that case we go from a minor and

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.590 
so in that case we go from a minor and
you<00:02:52.020> would<00:02:52.200> keep<00:02:52.680> your<00:02:53.160> fingers<00:02:53.670> in<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.180> same

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
you would keep your fingers in the same

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.550 
you would keep your fingers in the same
exact<00:02:55.500> formation<00:02:56.190> and<00:02:56.430> simply<00:02:57.000> move<00:02:57.240> them

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
exact formation and simply move them

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.380 
exact formation and simply move them
down<00:02:58.610> the<00:02:59.610> next<00:02:59.850> set<00:03:00.090> of<00:03:00.120> strings<00:03:02.030> so<00:03:03.030> from<00:03:03.300> the

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
down the next set of strings so from the

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.120 
down the next set of strings so from the
a<00:03:03.420> minor<00:03:03.840> to<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:04.560> he<00:03:04.740> cord

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
a minor to the he cord

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.830 
a minor to the he cord
it's<00:03:06.730> just<00:03:06.940> simply<00:03:07.300> moving<00:03:07.570> your<00:03:07.890> fingers

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
it's just simply moving your fingers

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.740 
it's just simply moving your fingers
down<00:03:10.840> to<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.260> next<00:03:11.530> set<00:03:11.680> of<00:03:11.710> strings<00:03:12.130> and<00:03:12.750> to
