00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.680
 actually u3 was mitm so 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.810
 In principle, I would love to do it 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.779
 I do not know exactly when was o 3 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.880
 I'm sure for sure 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.269
 and I do not know exactly where I am then 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.880
 but if I manage somehow helga 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.469
 so if I'm successful, I'm too 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.600
 yet I can not but be 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.040
 promise because i do not get 100 percent 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.629
 knows how it works 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.730
 you sure know with whom weathers 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.199
 I guess I'm in a team this time 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.219
 his 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:48.350
 You can not have the same teams 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.649
 take like last time 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.629
 and yes already advise my comments 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:59.039
 but it should not be too heavy 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:02.609
 People he is one of my best youtube 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:06.019
 this is also coincidental in the 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.019
 Last days another video came 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.600
 asked who is a true three 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.000
 teampartner so the whole is so the 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.280
 gew has announced that it is about 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.450
 one and a half months after the e3 with so 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.970
 a fair that was there o 3 take place 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.710
 So if everything works out, I know 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.090
 not really all participants 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.630
 the ones for the first two stints 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.720
 were 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.550
 this case really come, if so so 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.750
 all come then is the team 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.960
 to which we have already determined the 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:52.350
 i also just i think so 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.510
 lately that could be it 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.130
 Write comments 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.380
 his name consists of two words i 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.850
 Do that for the very stupid people 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.890
 yes i do not tell you the name but 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:07.350
 I make such a small puzzle disabled 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:09.000
 people are the opposite of blue is that 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.979
 first word and the second word 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.450
 the first I do not in real life out on 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.950
 the cash of penny 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.390
 the taste is for all people 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.440
 who know it can be happy and happy 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.000
 the question with whom teams because so and so 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.820
 we can already officially 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.500
 say that we think a few 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.900
 spoon not necessarily again 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.030
 true or or three times in any case 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.459
 because they do not have to 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.170
 maybe not so maybe 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:41.220
 It is all many more banks 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:45.050
 contracts can be just one you can 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.050
 pvp skill but not pay
