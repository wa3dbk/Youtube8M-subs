00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 I know very well want to tell you in this 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.140
 there are minutes left for the most 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.880
 battle of our lives as 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:14.370
 professionals everything is summarized to today or we 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.660
 we consecrate as a team we do not stay 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.789
 where we are judged by played 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:24.470
 centimeter by centimeter until the whistle 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:27.810
 we are at a vital crossroads 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:30.539
 we can stay there and get us out 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.360
 the shit or we can fight for our 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.530
 way back to honor we can 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.140
 get out of this hell are you 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:43.379
 they can do it they are the only owners of 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.950
 your future no one else than you can 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.500
 be a legend of this story 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:52.860
 to recover our honor that of you the 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.670
 of the people you do not know very well the 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.489
 life gives you and takes away that is part of the 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.219
 life but you only assume it when you 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.080
 remove those things that hurt you and you 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.170
 realize that life is only 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.290
 a game of centimeters and so is the 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.200
 football because in any game in the 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.350
 life or in football the margin of error 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.200
 it's very small half passed late to a 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.110
 in advance and you lose half a second very 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.660
 slow very fast and you can not get there 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.300
 all those centimeters that we need 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:30.330
 be there on the court to be in each 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:34.020
 moment of the game in each minute in each 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:36.780
 second in this team we fight for each 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.390
 piece of court in this team we 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.610
 we kill every inch by removing the 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.750
 rival because we know that if we add 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.810
 all those centimeters that's going to be the 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.880
 point difference between winning and losing 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.300
 between living or dying between staying in 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.630
 shadow or retrieve the category is to live 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:00.410
 something else in any fight who is 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:04.110
 willing to die is who wins his place 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:06.600
 and I know that if they are willing to live 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.479
 it's because they're still willing to 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.210
 fight and die on the court for that 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.210
 centimeter that we lack because that is 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:18.590
 what it means to live being willing to 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.590
 die for what one is going 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:26.150
 we have fought a year to recover 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:29.409
 our respect we are a team with 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:32.090
 story that you should not be where it is 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:37.220
 let's return the joy to our people 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:40.159
 to us to our children now now 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.159
 I can not force them to do it alone 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:45.590
 Just look at your classmates 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:48.230
 look them in the eyes and you will see a man 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.290
 willing to run every inch of the 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.849
 court for you look at them they will have a 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.819
 man who is willing to die for 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:59.510
 this team because he knows that you 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:03.109
 they will do the same for him that's a team 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.689
 boys because we beat you now like 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:08.470
 a team we do not get lost in the shadows 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:12.549
 as individuals that is soccer gentlemen 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.549
 that's all it is
