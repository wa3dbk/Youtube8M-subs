been really strong in his past
it's<00:03:21.239> also<00:03:21.389> possible<00:03:21.810> he<00:03:21.900> didn't<00:03:22.049> have<00:03:22.139> a

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:22.169

whole lot of muscle and strength to

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:24.860 
whole lot of muscle and strength to
begin<00:03:23.310> with<00:03:23.430> it's<00:03:23.579> just<00:03:23.669> fat<00:03:24.000> and<00:03:24.269> walking

begin with it's just fat and walking

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.659 
begin with it's just fat and walking
around<00:03:25.019> telling<00:03:25.200> people<00:03:25.380> how<00:03:26.069> strong<00:03:26.400> years

around telling people how strong years

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:28.129 
around telling people how strong years
so<00:03:26.819> they<00:03:27.060> perceive<00:03:27.389> him<00:03:27.510> as<00:03:27.599> being<00:03:27.750> big<00:03:28.019> and

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
well what they'll try to do is not maybe

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.860 
well what they'll try to do is not maybe
the<00:05:08.280> pass<00:05:08.460> himself<00:05:08.729> off<00:05:08.940> as<00:05:09.150> a<00:05:09.389> bodybuilder

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
the pass himself off as a bodybuilder

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.469 
the pass himself off as a bodybuilder
but<00:05:10.409> pass<00:05:10.650> themselves<00:05:10.889> off<00:05:11.159> as<00:05:11.310> power<00:05:11.970> lifters

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
but pass themselves off as power lifters

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.120 
but pass themselves off as power lifters
because<00:05:12.960> power<00:05:13.199> lifters<00:05:13.530> have<00:05:13.680> more<00:05:13.919> of<00:05:13.979> that

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
because power lifters have more of that

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.640 
because power lifters have more of that
look<00:05:14.430> now<00:05:15.060> when<00:05:15.870> they<00:05:15.960> put<00:05:16.169> the<00:05:16.289> weights<00:05:16.440> up

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
look now when they put the weights up

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:17.629 
look now when they put the weights up
that's<00:05:16.830> when<00:05:17.009> you'll<00:05:17.130> know<00:05:17.159> whether<00:05:17.430> they're

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 
that's when you'll know whether they're

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:18.680 
that's when you'll know whether they're
bullshitting<00:05:18.000> or<00:05:18.150> not<00:05:18.240> because<00:05:18.419> if<00:05:18.509> they're<00:05:18.659> a

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
bullshitting or not because if they're a

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.390 
bullshitting or not because if they're a
power<00:05:18.960> lifter<00:05:19.409> they<00:05:19.830> should<00:05:20.009> be<00:05:20.069> putting<00:05:20.280> up

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
power lifter they should be putting up

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.680 
power lifter they should be putting up
some<00:05:20.550> serious<00:05:20.759> freaking<00:05:21.180> weight<00:05:21.360> so<00:05:21.539> they're

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
some serious freaking weight so they're

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.510 
some serious freaking weight so they're
not<00:05:21.840> they're<00:05:22.289> not<00:05:22.319> a<00:05:22.469> bodybuilder<00:05:22.979> for<00:05:23.219> power

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
not they're not a bodybuilder for power

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.149 
not they're not a bodybuilder for power
so<00:05:23.880> I<00:05:23.940> guess<00:05:24.060> it<00:05:24.180> would<00:05:24.270> be<00:05:24.300> tight<00:05:24.569> one<00:05:25.169> wannabe

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:26.159 
so I guess it would be tight one wannabe

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.469 
so I guess it would be tight one wannabe
bodybuilder<00:05:26.580> type<00:05:26.819> to<00:05:27.060> want<00:05:27.330> to<00:05:27.389> be

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 
bodybuilder type to want to be

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:29.749 
bodybuilder type to want to be
bodybuilder<00:05:27.930> in<00:05:28.289> type<00:05:28.560> 2<00:05:29.159> would<00:05:29.340> also<00:05:29.490> be<00:05:29.729> a

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 
bodybuilder in type 2 would also be a

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:33.170 
bodybuilder in type 2 would also be a
type<00:05:30.000> 1<00:05:30.360> type<00:05:30.840> 1<00:05:31.110> wannabe<00:05:31.620> power<00:05:31.889> lifter<00:05:32.250> Jesus

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
type 1 type 1 wannabe power lifter Jesus

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.149 
type 1 type 1 wannabe power lifter Jesus

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:35.159 
is getting confusing them so I hope this

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:36.260 
is getting confusing them so I hope this
kind<00:05:35.430> of<00:05:35.490> clears<00:05:35.669> up<00:05:35.819> some<00:05:35.940> things<00:05:36.030> to<00:05:36.240> you
