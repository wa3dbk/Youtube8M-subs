applied my heat protectant before I

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.030

started the video just to save everybody

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.790 
started the video just to save everybody
some<00:00:44.250> time<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:45.690> want<00:00:46.289> your<00:00:46.440> hair<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.590> look

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
some time so you want your hair to look

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.000 
some time so you want your hair to look
something<00:00:47.190> like<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:48.649> then<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.860> can

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
something like that and then you can

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.670 
something like that and then you can
take<00:00:50.190> like<00:00:50.250> larger<00:00:51.090> chunks<00:00:51.449> later<00:00:51.690> but

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
take like larger chunks later but

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.010 
take like larger chunks later but
basically<00:00:53.460> if<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:54.030> have<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.420> time<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.870> would

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
basically if you have the time it would

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.490 
basically if you have the time it would
be<00:00:55.110> better<00:00:55.289> if<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.530> used<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.219> used<00:00:56.699> smaller

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
be better if you used and used smaller

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.330 
be better if you used and used smaller

that I'm gonna do the same thing on the
other<00:02:21.569> side<00:02:22.640> making<00:02:23.640> sure<00:02:23.819> not<00:02:24.000> to<00:02:24.060> make<00:02:24.299> it

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
other side making sure not to make it

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.229 
other side making sure not to make it
too<00:02:24.510> curly<00:02:25.140> so<00:02:25.799> again<00:02:26.129> this<00:02:26.459> one<00:02:26.700> is<00:02:26.879> kind<00:02:27.150> of

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
too curly so again this one is kind of

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.680 
too curly so again this one is kind of
like<00:02:27.299> to<00:02:27.659> the<00:02:27.780> side<00:02:28.079> and<00:02:29.420> back

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
like to the side and back

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.059 
like to the side and back
I<00:02:30.720> made<00:02:30.930> these<00:02:31.049> just<00:02:31.319> a<00:02:31.440> little<00:02:31.470> bit<00:02:31.799> higher

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
I made these just a little bit higher

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.500 
I made these just a little bit higher
than<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.489> other<00:02:32.640> side<00:02:32.909> just<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.239> kind<00:02:33.450> of

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
than the other side just to kind of

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.680 
than the other side just to kind of
demonstrate<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:34.230> this<00:02:34.470> would<00:02:34.709> be<00:02:34.829> even<00:02:34.980> more

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
demonstrate and this would be even more

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.660 
demonstrate and this would be even more
beautiful<00:02:36.690> if<00:02:36.840> you<00:02:36.870> have<00:02:37.140> like<00:02:37.409> short<00:02:37.950> bangs
