feels like it was a little bit of a
rehash<00:05:26.000> the<00:05:26.419> whole<00:05:26.599> Casey<00:05:26.870> Jones<00:05:27.260> not<00:05:27.530> keeping

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
up with the Ninja Turtles felt very

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.430 
up with the Ninja Turtles felt very
minused<00:05:29.479> of<00:05:29.690> an<00:05:29.780> episode<00:05:30.020> that<00:05:30.169> was<00:05:30.320> shown

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
minused of an episode that was shown

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.900 
minused of an episode that was shown
earlier<00:05:30.620> this<00:05:30.919> season<00:05:31.250> where<00:05:31.370> April<00:05:31.639> O'Neil

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
earlier this season where April O'Neil

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.129 
earlier this season where April O'Neil
was<00:05:32.090> feeling<00:05:32.419> she<00:05:32.570> couldn't<00:05:32.840> keep<00:05:32.930> up<00:05:33.110> with

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:33.139 
was feeling she couldn't keep up with

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:34.600 
was feeling she couldn't keep up with
Ninja<00:05:33.440> Turtles<00:05:33.770> and<00:05:33.919> Raphael<00:05:34.310> and<00:05:34.370> Casey

Ninja Turtles and Raphael and Casey

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.040 
Ninja Turtles and Raphael and Casey
Jones<00:05:34.910> fighting<00:05:35.450> with<00:05:35.539> each<00:05:35.570> other

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
Jones fighting with each other

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.629 
Jones fighting with each other
felt<00:05:36.289> very<00:05:36.349> reminiscent<00:05:36.770> of<00:05:36.979> how<00:05:37.130> Raphael

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:37.639 
felt very reminiscent of how Raphael

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:39.190 
felt very reminiscent of how Raphael
used<00:05:37.820> to<00:05:37.880> fight<00:05:38.060> with<00:05:38.210> Leonardo<00:05:38.750> and<00:05:38.960> I<00:05:39.020> think

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
used to fight with Leonardo and I think

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.960 
used to fight with Leonardo and I think
the<00:05:39.260> reason<00:05:39.560> why<00:05:39.710> I<00:05:39.740> had<00:05:40.160> that<00:05:40.190> nitpick<00:05:40.729> about

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970 
the reason why I had that nitpick about

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:42.969 
the reason why I had that nitpick about
it<00:05:41.120> it's<00:05:41.270> because<00:05:41.690> the<00:05:41.960> actual<00:05:42.530> cool<00:05:42.830> thing

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:42.979 
it it's because the actual cool thing

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:44.379 
it it's because the actual cool thing
about<00:05:43.070> this<00:05:43.250> episode<00:05:43.520> was<00:05:43.820> slash<00:05:44.120> and

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:44.389 
about this episode was slash and

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:46.089 
about this episode was slash and
newtralizer<00:05:44.419> being<00:05:45.139> together<00:05:45.260> and<00:05:45.710> I<00:05:45.889> felt

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:46.099 
newtralizer being together and I felt

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:47.770 
newtralizer being together and I felt
like<00:05:46.190> we<00:05:46.310> didn't<00:05:46.520> really<00:05:46.699> get<00:05:47.090> too<00:05:47.330> much<00:05:47.539> into

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
like we didn't really get too much into

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.330 
like we didn't really get too much into
that<00:05:47.990> we<00:05:48.110> get<00:05:48.229> a<00:05:48.260> backstory<00:05:48.830> of<00:05:49.070> how<00:05:49.190> they

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.340 
that we get a backstory of how they

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:50.890 
that we get a backstory of how they
actually<00:05:49.490> met<00:05:49.940> I<00:05:50.120> would<00:05:50.240> love<00:05:50.539> to<00:05:50.630> see<00:05:50.780> this
