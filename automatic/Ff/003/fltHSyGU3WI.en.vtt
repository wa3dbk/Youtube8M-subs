00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
other non Apple device with it and it'll

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.620 
other non Apple device with it and it'll
work<00:00:34.309> so<00:00:35.309> you<00:00:35.370> can<00:00:35.760> see<00:00:35.910> they've<00:00:36.090> designed<00:00:36.420> it

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
work so you can see they've designed it

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.500 
work so you can see they've designed it
to<00:00:36.660> look<00:00:37.020> like<00:00:37.850> 1970s<00:00:39.590> retro<00:00:40.670> guitar<00:00:41.670> stack<00:00:42.120> or

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
to look like 1970s retro guitar stack or

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.990 
to look like 1970s retro guitar stack or
amplifier<00:00:43.079> stack<00:00:43.440> if<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.100> put<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.309> ruler<00:00:44.579> on<00:00:44.730> it

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
amplifier stack if you put a ruler on it

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.270 
amplifier stack if you put a ruler on it
it's<00:00:45.239> 16<00:00:45.840> inches<00:00:45.960> wide<00:00:46.440> so<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:46.920> get<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.070> rough

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
it's 16 inches wide so you get a rough

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.740 
it's 16 inches wide so you get a rough
idea<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.670> how<00:00:47.789> big<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.539> if<00:00:48.629> you're

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
idea of how big it is so if you're

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.000 
idea of how big it is so if you're
wondering<00:00:49.050> how<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.289> sounds<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:49.770> think<00:00:49.950> it

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
wondering how it sounds I think it

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.690 
wondering how it sounds I think it
sounds<00:00:50.250> really<00:00:50.309> great

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
I'm really really happy with it the base

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.369 
I'm really really happy with it the base
is<00:00:53.070> great<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:54.090> treble<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.539> also<00:00:55.170> really

buttons that are on it here separate

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.260 
buttons that are on it here separate
from<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.159> knobs<00:01:50.369> you've<00:01:50.640> got<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.790> pause<00:01:51.000> play

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
from the knobs you've got a pause play

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.700 
from the knobs you've got a pause play
button<00:01:51.600> you've<00:01:51.750> got<00:01:51.869> an<00:01:51.930> input<00:01:52.079> button<00:01:52.530> and

couldn't<00:02:33.310> hear<00:02:33.430> it<00:02:33.489> all<00:02:33.670> over<00:02:33.849> the<00:02:33.939> house<00:02:34.090> when

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:34.329 
couldn't hear it all over the house when

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:35.729 
couldn't hear it all over the house when
I<00:02:34.360> wanted<00:02:34.540> to<00:02:34.599> play<00:02:34.810> music<00:02:35.200> and<00:02:35.349> be<00:02:35.440> walking

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
I wanted to play music and be walking

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:36.990 
I wanted to play music and be walking
around<00:02:35.829> the<00:02:36.010> house<00:02:36.159> and<00:02:36.400> look<00:02:36.519> this<00:02:36.640> thing<00:02:36.879> I

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
around the house and look this thing I

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.850 
around the house and look this thing I
can<00:02:37.150> hear<00:02:37.299> it<00:02:37.390> everywhere<00:02:37.690> it's<00:02:38.620> not<00:02:38.680> the

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
can hear it everywhere it's not the

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:39.990 
can hear it everywhere it's not the
loudest<00:02:39.010> thing<00:02:39.310> in<00:02:39.489> the<00:02:39.549> world<00:02:39.700> but<00:02:39.849> it's

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
loudest thing in the world but it's

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.069 
loudest thing in the world but it's
really<00:02:40.329> really<00:02:40.629> good

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
really really good

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:42.960 
really really good
so<00:02:41.260> I<00:02:41.290> highly<00:02:41.739> recommended<00:02:42.370> that's<00:02:42.819> the

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
so I highly recommended that's the

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.470 
so I highly recommended that's the
Skullcandy<00:02:43.599> vandal
