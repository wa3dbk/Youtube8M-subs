first<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.510> all<00:00:47.180> extract<00:00:48.180> some<00:00:48.420> features<00:00:48.960> and

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
first of all extract some features and

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.180 
first of all extract some features and
done<00:00:50.160> it<00:00:50.579> compares<00:00:51.360> those<00:00:51.719> features<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:53.070> the

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
ones in the database I taste a program

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.349 
ones in the database I taste a program
on<00:00:57.000> iphone<00:00:57.780> poor<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:59.180> extracting<00:01:00.180> two

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
on iphone poor and it extracting two

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.050 
on iphone poor and it extracting two
features<00:01:00.870> takes<00:01:02.030> about<00:01:03.030> 40<00:01:03.600> seconds<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.320> in

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.060 
features takes about 40 seconds and in

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:11.929 
features takes about 40 seconds and in
one<00:01:06.060> second<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.780> can<00:01:08.420> compare<00:01:09.710> 15<00:01:10.710> images<00:01:11.250> so

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
one second it can compare 15 images so

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.550 
one second it can compare 15 images so
let's<00:01:12.420> say<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:12.659> in<00:01:13.439> your<00:01:13.680> database<00:01:14.450> you<00:01:15.450> have

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
let's say you in your database you have

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.710 
let's say you in your database you have
10<00:01:16.560> different<00:01:16.710> locations<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.700> for<00:01:18.090> every

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
10 different locations and for every

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.499 
10 different locations and for every
location<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.409> have<00:01:19.710> 10<00:01:20.700> different<00:01:20.850> images

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
location you have 10 different images

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.719 
location you have 10 different images
and<00:01:21.689> it<00:01:21.780> takes<00:01:22.049> about<00:01:22.170> 50<00:01:22.710> seconds<00:01:23.189> to

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
and it takes about 50 seconds to

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.510 
and it takes about 50 seconds to
recognize<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.720> location<00:01:24.869> at<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.070> beauty<00:01:26.340> of

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
recognize the location at the beauty of

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.240 
recognize the location at the beauty of
application<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.470> do<00:01:28.680> not<00:01:28.950> need

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
application is that you do not need

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.660 
application is that you do not need
internet<00:01:29.850> connection<00:01:30.680> as<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:31.979> see<00:01:32.189> now<00:01:32.220> it

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
internet connection as you see now it

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.429 
internet connection as you see now it
recognize<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.390> building<00:01:33.780> its<00:01:33.990> flamming

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
recognize the building its flamming

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.330 
recognize the building its flamming
building<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.130> first<00:01:35.490> entrance<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:36.780> can

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
building to first entrance and you can

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.600 
building to first entrance and you can
then<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.640> can<00:01:38.670> locate<00:01:39.240> yourself<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:40.610> see

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
then you can locate yourself and see

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.420 
then you can locate yourself and see
where<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:41.939> are<00:01:42.210> on<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.750> map<00:01:42.979> let's<00:01:43.979> take

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
where you are on the map let's take

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.280 
where you are on the map let's take
another<00:01:44.670> picture<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:47.000> let's<00:01:48.229> move<00:01:49.229> forward

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
another picture and let's move forward

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.069 
another picture and let's move forward
and<00:01:51.320> let's<00:01:52.320> go<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.159> next<00:01:53.369> location<00:01:54.079> yes

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
and let's go to the next location yes

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.370 
and let's go to the next location yes
fountain<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:56.040> way<00:01:56.909> pretty<00:01:57.210> very<00:01:57.810> cool<00:01:58.079> place

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
fountain I way pretty very cool place

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.700 
fountain I way pretty very cool place
let's<00:01:59.009> take<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.969> picture<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.630> phantom<00:02:01.439> and

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
let's take the picture of phantom and

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.730 
let's take the picture of phantom and
see<00:02:02.219> if<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.790> program<00:02:03.210> is<00:02:03.479> going<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:04.619> recognize

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
see if the program is going to recognize

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.669 
see if the program is going to recognize
it<00:02:06.890> okay

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
it okay

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:14.770 
it okay
take<00:02:09.679> it<00:02:10.009> and<00:02:11.080> use<00:02:12.080> it<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:13.730> beauty<00:02:14.060> of<00:02:14.120> program

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
take it and use it the beauty of program

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.260 
take it and use it the beauty of program
is<00:02:15.080> that<00:02:15.140> it<00:02:15.560> does<00:02:15.980> not<00:02:16.040> mean<00:02:16.670> internet

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
is that it does not mean internet

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.650 
is that it does not mean internet
connection<00:02:18.200> to<00:02:18.830> recognize<00:02:19.400> recognize<00:02:20.330> the

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
connection to recognize recognize the

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.890 
connection to recognize recognize the
locations<00:02:21.550> you<00:02:22.550> can<00:02:22.580> actually<00:02:23.000> use<00:02:23.420> this

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
locations you can actually use this

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.290 
locations you can actually use this
approach<00:02:24.680> you<00:02:25.040> can<00:02:25.190> apply<00:02:25.459> this<00:02:25.580> approach<00:02:26.060> to

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
approach you can apply this approach to

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.460 
approach you can apply this approach to
every<00:02:26.900> place<00:02:27.200> let's<00:02:28.190> say<00:02:28.430> you<00:02:28.489> are<00:02:29.060> in

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
every place let's say you are in

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.530 
every place let's say you are in
historical<00:02:30.470> place<00:02:30.739> and<00:02:31.190> you're<00:02:31.790> in<00:02:32.090> front<00:02:32.390> of
