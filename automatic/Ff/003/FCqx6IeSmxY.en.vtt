00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:16.199
 when starting av drawing with autocad 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.220
 we must define the characteristics of the 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.970
 drawing 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:24.090
 that is, we must define the unity of 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.099
 measure accuracy 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.949
 after which the limits of the must be defined 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.590
 drawing ie the size of the sheet of 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.600
 work in this case 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.899
 we will use a format worksheet 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:41.520
 a3 that in centimeters to 43 centimeters of 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:43.140
 base and 20.7 in height after which in 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.850
 drawing layouts we can 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:50.850
 define the garbage of our one ep 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:53.910
 and of the grid we can activate it 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.670
 snap to the grid snap and yes 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.629
 involves how a magnet attracts us 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.860
 cursor only on points that 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.119
 intersect the intentional grid meta for 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.479
 view the criticism one needs to do 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.100
 zoom extension but see in this case 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.320
 the truth too big 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.890
 have more precise references not 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.759
 is taken to thicker away if 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.670
 let's change the idea of ​​measurement and move on to mm 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.299
 and we want todt resentment a sheet of 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.119
 work format a3 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:37.409
 obviously you have to type base of the 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:40.020
 leaf 430 mm comma 379 we modify 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.490
 also drawing settings ie 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:47.250
 we modify the snap garbage 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:49.619
 this time we will adopt square with one 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.510
 spacing of a millimeter while for 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.190
 the grid spacing of 10 meters 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:58.000
 how to say if this time the grid 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:01.420
 obviously the size is much thicker 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.010
 drawing spacing is 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.810
 that of the grid will be made 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.070
 based on the type of design you want 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.869
 to achieve 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.450
 It is obvious that if trap is a drawing of 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:17.080
 precision should be adopted 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.180
 Basic community mm is of sign e 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.150
 small size will adopt a 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.680
 small sheet and vice versa 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:29.410
 how much element to define when yes 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:32.500
 the layer starts with the drawing of the layers 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.180
 it is nothing but the analog of a sheet 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.600
 of glossy paper on which we go to 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.690
 draw students we can associate a 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:44.380
 particular color is a name that 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.180
 we can make it active by risottino this 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:50.730
 that he entered to mark later 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.730
 will be operated on those
