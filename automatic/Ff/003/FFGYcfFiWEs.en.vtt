00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:41.800
 sata and we find ourselves today to 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.530

 and yes it is possible 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.850

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.210
 that this is done on android 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.559
 exclusively it is possible on apple 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:04.210
 I know people who did it on 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:06.640
 apple and so you need 12 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:10.119
 logical devices that shunned the wii 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.910
 did you serve more to a small 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.500
 information 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.680
 gg I said sorry in 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.660

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.340
 that record on this phone 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.460

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:31.330
 register and samassa stops recording 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.729
 my month so down to the side of the less 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.170
