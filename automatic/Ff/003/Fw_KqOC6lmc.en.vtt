00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.350
 Today I'll show you how he does that 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.690
 switch port version 3.1 from pacmag 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.430
 properly installed and it applies to 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.170
 first click on the downloadlink 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.630
 The description and dark 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.190
 It's a wheel again, so it's a wheel again 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.220
 come is a pact year is best 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:04.489
 also with indra the file pulls on the 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:07.310
 disco then makes the right click on it 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:10.310
 and pack in switch port 3 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.490
 underlined a slate should now one 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.780
 a little longer that he is so short 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.700
 was still in the seconds but now 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.759
 it does not matter how you get the new one 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.440
 if he came to that, then you do 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.240
 a right-click is the files here 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.990
 made a right click on with sport 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:29.300
 v3 starts a bit longer with us 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.970
 then click on as administrator 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.259
 Run gives her draufkommt here see 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.040
 her the window sill 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:39.979
 then click on file search you come to 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.759
 then you choose switch port v3 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.460
 dll point out then you do also open 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:49.369
 the folder could close again 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.350
 like that and then what three girls like 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.789
 I want to try that out now 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.970
 marcus meyn server and show you this 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:56.660
 then so on the edge of town server sets you 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.390
 somewhere 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.819
 then you go back to that 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.550
 windowsill mac also goes to window 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:05.929
 Select inject 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.020
 then he stands that is three seconds that 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:11.240
 3 seconds have you been up there 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.790
 your girl two windows and threw 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.100
 so then comes the 800 following 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.880
 window suite ntc possibly in 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.940
 background do you get okay is b2 that 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.620
 right window that's something 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.020
 another looks like google chrome 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.310
 long then a falters comes then 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.020
 here the new window at and 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.060
 is likely to come then 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.560
 which the language to hold the side 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.099
 but you do not understand me 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:40.700
 ok so that also select there is synonymous 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:44.959
 sweet spot you see this window like that 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.880
 klop once is inventory this zloty that 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:51.080
 dish is that she would be 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:54.340
 j2 the motto that will be four walls the 4th 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.340
 and the word 5 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.510
 Then you click back on your windows 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:06.530
 You see, poison sword wants that 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:09.290
 Switch with 10 11 ks or 20 dsps like that 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.890
 thank you by mitchell wanted only times 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.660
 To attack them by 20 then we would 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.160
 now on strong resistance losglück 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.520
 Not quite me will show something 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:23.540
 sometimes go very fast and then 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:26.450
 you see 15 bonuses successful with slot 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.750
 1 quotes I have now 23 average 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:32.240
 you can also hurt at advanced 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.730
 You can boni so to speak 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:40.060
 either or see through either 20 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:42.080
 or 4 if I click start now 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.530
 just had to wait briefly 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:49.670
 if now synonymous instead of clique then would 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:53.210
 either either 20 dss or four 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.530
 fks get there now is 26 dss but 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.560
 it would work now if I did 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:00.530
 now here in the cut fks in make 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.910
 So you see eight fks here now 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.390
 So worked out I can show that 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:08.090
 it also goes with higher values ​​here 22 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.450
 fps I try to record everything 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.820
 I do everything on the server c fund 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.600
 forms the ok for a few days so 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.440
 done wrong 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.549
 then you can ask at several places here 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.980
 you can the apartment first 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:25.880
 if you're that down there 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:28.730
 back then pulls in the window also 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:33.050
 read then that's what it is 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:36.170
 the the switches and that the 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:38.410
 So the 1 to 4 switcher 15 and that 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:40.880
 the 6 to 7 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:43.190
 and there could be a single picture 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.170
 that somehow did not add meaning 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.530
 Buyers can still adjust after 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:50.000
 Buyers for 515 activate and after 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.010
 include six to seven active that 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 If now website clicks somewhere 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.919
 Just go to a shop 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.040
 So the shop where you buy the one 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:59.660
 and server and then he buys you 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:03.980
 automatically after when he does 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:05.180
 So he has this attitude here 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.370
 I do not understand that either 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.800
 know yes I could actually have so many 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:12.130
 set slots as you want 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.420
 and there are all bonuses too 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:17.900
 you see in things I have to say 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:20.890
 Here life is as understood 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:23.390
 joke so vitality 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:30.230
 but it will be that one would still have 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:31.880
 know and have fun with the switch word 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:32.740
 i really like him he has a lot of me 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:38.690
 helped 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:40.550
 neither scan iq until then i want to say 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.560
 write me the comments from her 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.240
 next video will see, oh yes 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.720
 you want to turn it off then you can 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:52.280
 just kick on the window here 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:54.020
 then here comes a small question if the 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.900
 really should be stopped or only 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.370
 Hidden if now Jack lays then 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.140
 Will that end if you look at mine 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.850
 he will not click it again so only 

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:04.250
 I'm hiding on java now 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.770
 The girl does not want to end directly 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.880
 two windows with ended when now on 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.360
 my ringing will not be 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.800
 happen 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.900
 yes then you can do that again 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.410
 close one has actually no 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:17.960
 only problem with this with the 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:19.280
 switch port is always good and works well 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.800
 actually on every server except 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:24.710
 on one I should also have the 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.000
 i think long dong was really funny 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.400
 but it did not work out that me 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.750
 no longer bother with the fun 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.750
 the switch port until then
