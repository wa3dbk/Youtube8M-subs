00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:16.049
 The product is located here in front of the TV and there is a sound bar and the left hand 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:19.259
 Wireless subwoofer will be a product that is configured in this case 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.320
 At first we will explain from 8 sound bars 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:26.390
 To this sound bar 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:29.480
 Digital sound projector is first beam speaker here to the left and right 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.400
 22 beam speakers are installed 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.120
 Better than this beam speaker 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:41.540
 Let me lend you a beam 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:44.120
 You will be able to fly diagonally You will hear that sound reflected on the wall 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:48.469
 Though the speaker itself is in front 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:51.280
 It can be said that you can enjoy the sound of nail breaking from the left and right rear 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:56.289
 It becomes a product of the front surround 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:01:01.340
 Branch width direction of housing It is one meter 10 centimeters 1100 mm 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:07.540
 Now it's behind the TV will be a 55-inch TV so it will be in size now 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:07.540
 It is a form of officer that fits a TV of about 47 or more 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:15.289
 In addition to the 22 beam speakers that were included in the case this time 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:21.469
 Has built-in stereo speakers on the left and right 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:24.460
 In the place where the sound bar is going to improve the sound quality, this time I put the power on my feet 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:28.180
 Crowded firmly put and the speaker without 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:31.260
 The sound quality is also enhanced in a natural way 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:36.060
 I can not see it for a while 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:39.800
 If you have an origi, there is a charm 4 type before h day and this time corresponds to Instaport

 Of shape you are what have large entered

 Things like this with a sound bar 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:51.869
 I think it's cool to say that grounding and operability are good 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:55.799
 The location is the biggest one, but the floor is from the bottom of this TV screen 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:02:01.850
 It is up to here, but here and there are more and more and more and more TVs 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:05.400
 This time while the speaker is suppressed to some extent height in the form, such as height 8 cm 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:08.550
 It becomes a model that secured a certain sound quality 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.700
 It is subwoofer which will be on the left side sequentially 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.180
