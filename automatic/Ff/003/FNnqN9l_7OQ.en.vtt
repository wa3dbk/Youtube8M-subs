 group love fist at their concert and how 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.390
 it turned out control was already here he 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.119
 also asked bikers to protect the group 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.950
 office at the concert but with his requests they 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.259
 threw him through the window and left 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.810
 absolutely naked yes but we were given a chance 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.820
 show what we can for bikers is important 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.070
 how we ride the bike itself and 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.989
 Now we are chasing a little people 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.660
 biker swords to help us save 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.100
 groups of shaft fest and you in this mission 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.380
 doomed to success because that's it 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.410

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.840
 break up your bikes you 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.269
 actually doomed to success you will be 1 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.630
 in this race they had already started 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:30.630
 Winners well from then on I think clearly 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.950
 need to pass through the tag checkpoints and 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.930
 the most important thing is not to drop the bike yourself 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.170
 they did not overtake you 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.170
 that's all 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:23.970

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.980
