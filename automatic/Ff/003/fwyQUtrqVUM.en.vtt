00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
have to worry about it I get a little

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.490 
have to worry about it I get a little
ball<00:02:37.650> mount<00:02:37.920> which<00:02:38.160> is<00:02:38.190> pretty<00:02:38.519> neat<00:02:39.500> that's

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
ball mount which is pretty neat that's

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.410 
ball mount which is pretty neat that's
probably<00:02:40.709> okay<00:02:41.580> so<00:02:41.640> this<00:02:41.819> comes<00:02:42.060> off<00:02:42.180> here<00:02:44.420> put

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
probably okay so this comes off here put

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:52.880 
probably okay so this comes off here put
this<00:02:45.599> in<00:02:49.340> figure<00:02:50.340> it<00:02:50.459> out<00:02:50.580> later<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:52.140> MHC<00:02:52.500> also

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
this in figure it out later the MHC also

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.410 
this in figure it out later the MHC also
features<00:02:53.220> an<00:02:53.340> internal<00:02:53.730> battery<00:02:54.030> so<00:02:54.239> there's

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
features an internal battery so there's

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.119 
features an internal battery so there's

there's no way to sort of swap it on the

something with that sort of like you

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.920 
something with that sort of like you

don't think it can be like for that but

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.250 
don't think it can be like for that but
it's<00:03:22.409> the<00:03:22.470> size<00:03:22.680> of<00:03:22.769> a<00:03:23.150> guitar<00:03:24.150> pick<00:03:24.480> and<00:03:25.110> then
