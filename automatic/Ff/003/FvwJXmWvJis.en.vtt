00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:08.160
 I was in a dirty state the kind 

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:08.160
 states that we do not recover 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.010
 do not know how I was still breathing 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:16.500
 it was a kind of curse he 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:20.090
 would never manage to finish the job at 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.090
 settle my account permanently 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:35.640
 but I knew the father solution 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.760
 Jesus is sure did not give anything 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:44.520
 you believe this bullshit a 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:48.150
 paradise in making their game exists and is 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.260
 in full of gold it will be better than it is 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.089
 what you will do 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.829
 when you wake up will go one day and you 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:01:10.930
 realize that you finally burn everything 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:01:12.700
 and hands nine lots make us on 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.899
 the airbase they robbed us away 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:19.570
 from here we were prepared to fight 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:25.270
 the eaters is not the monsters of 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:27.880
 ladies hours for them we were a 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.670
 new food a flock of 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.500
 cattle waiting to be slaughtered us 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.920
 are the only survivors of this 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.920
 carnage 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.920
 not 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.989
 [Music] 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.710
 good massacre at midday 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:09.189
 is that that could still tear me 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.189
 a smile
