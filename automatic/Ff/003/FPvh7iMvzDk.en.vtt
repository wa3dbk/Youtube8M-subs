00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:08.929
 during the last months of university 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.420
 when I'm opening the master's degree 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:14.540
 I had decided to learn programming 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:18.419
 so sometimes the university is over 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:20.880
 bought a programming book and I have 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:25.079
 tried to learn by myself though 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.909
 after a few pages I had already realized 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:30.599
 that I needed support 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:34.350
 major then I searched for a course on 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:37.890
 internet and i found that fun 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.860
 which for me was really fundamental 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:45.330
 especially for the support I had 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:48.720
 after the course because that slaughter 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:50.670
 the teacher sent a lot 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.630
 really a disproportionate amount of 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.650
 mail and he always answered me 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.370
 practically instantly within 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:01.050
 a few hours 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.150
 and this was really fundamental 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.110
 without this kind of help for me 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.110
 it would have been really difficult 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.460
 about two months from the completion of 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.220
 course with a great deal of corruption 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.630
 I managed to publish my own 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:25.420
 before 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:28.890
 personal and digital company saipem 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.660
 on ipad iphone you can save 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.430
 consult all your own 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.490
 recipes 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:39.880
 after this first application it came out 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.770
 7 and I got caught right away 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.100
 one of the novelties 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.110
 let's say minors though that he found a lot 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.900
 funny 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.670
 or the possibility of having a 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:55.270
 sirmin everything you want then 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.100
 as anyone just buys the iphone 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:01.840
 place the first thing you do bomb 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:06.090
 siri questions I created suite ovens later 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.560
 this or create car pooling 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.680
 an application designed for all 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.270
 people who travel daily with 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.630
 friends or colleagues to reach the 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.820
 workplace to get home and into 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.280
 this app you can create a list 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.870
 of contacts and save trips that you 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.060
 do daily by selecting the 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.850
 people who are traveling with oil 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.620
 the driver with whom it is a journey e 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.820
 therefore being able to divide more 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.820
 simple travel expenses 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.260
 while I also made it wanted 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.530
 very important to me daily 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.200
 resais first application is the first one is 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.959
 been completely redesigned 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:51.680
 the graphical interface to make it more 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.989
 simple clean and in line with the 7 e 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.819
 second update instead I added 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.030
 tags with the possibility of being able to 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:01.540
 organize your own recipes in 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.540
 categories 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.700
 after 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:10.569
 about 10 and a half months from the last day 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.790
 won by sykes I received an email from 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:15.540
 part of apple that came to me 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:19.810
 required a side but never made ips 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:24.870
 because it had been selected for 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:28.810
 maybe be sponsored on the app store 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:31.389
 and for me it was really one of the emails 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.389
 most beautiful I've ever received 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:36.250
 because after a couple of days 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:38.109
 with the weekly update of the app 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.230
 store 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:44.109
 I saw sykes apples sponsored by tra 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.989
 new and noteworthy in the first 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:52.510
 app store page in Italy in others 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:56.439
 16 countries was really exciting 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:58.780
 the indescribable feeling after that 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:01.930
 sent him the artwork directly 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:08.129
 a week later I saw mine 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:11.349
 hardware and sykes in panne rehn in the 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:13.829
 state food and drink category 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:16.030
 united with the country in which it had been 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:19.659
 sponsored the week before 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:23.130
 and here another nice in the short 

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:23.130
 because it was really incredible 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.700
 in January the doctorate of 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.400
 search because it is reality I believe of 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.200
 being a developer ios am a 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.300
 molecular biologist 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.360
 then once entered the fourth 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.130
 I have been the laboratory of my career 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:44.970
 taken with all my old men 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:48.870
 protocols used previously scattered 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:52.560
 in signs on the mac or written on 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:55.470
 notebooks and so I invented myself how much 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.440
 they consume verona where they can save e 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:01.650
 organize all protocols of 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:04.020
 laboratory in the inside of the app 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:07.470
 inserted the possibility to export i 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.300
 own protocols in a file format 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.450
 openable owner of the same 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:17.910
 application this way once 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:20.640
 sent the file connects the only one who 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:23.610
 receives a must do other than open the 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:27.420
 file with the photo application will cost 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:29.220
 search is free and therefore on protocol 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.200
 is directly saved inside 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:34.610
 application is synchronized to a 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.610
 claut on all other devices 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:40.299
 Right now 

00:05:37.989 --> 00:05:44.989
 completing an update for mac 

00:05:40.299 --> 00:05:49.759
 evening when I entered great requests 

00:05:44.989 --> 00:05:53.739
 many icloud users and you will have to release it 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:57.769
 shortly for the future I'm going to 

00:05:53.739 --> 00:06:00.319
 create an application that is a book 

00:05:57.769 --> 00:06:05.149
 of interactive botany for schools 

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:09.549
 but middle and elementary schools I have to 

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:14.809
 still decide to set the application 

00:06:09.549 --> 00:06:15.529
 then redo a new book by 

00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:18.229
 kitchen 

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:21.619
 but this time with my own recipes 

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:22.309
 mom is the app will be called 

00:06:21.619 --> 00:06:25.249
 just like that 

00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:27.789
 the recipes I think my mom 

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:30.979
 they will come up with a good idea to do one 

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:33.309
 application of recipes a little different 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:33.309
 from the usual
