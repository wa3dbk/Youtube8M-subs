00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
Chinese though so obviously I can't use

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.170 
Chinese though so obviously I can't use

that on it'll show different parts of

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.710 
that on it'll show different parts of
the<00:01:29.310> world<00:01:29.490> over<00:01:30.000> in<00:01:30.090> ours<00:01:30.210> it's<00:01:30.479> kind<00:01:30.689> of

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
the world over in ours it's kind of

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.289 
the world over in ours it's kind of
annoying<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.170> turned<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.470> off<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:32.579> then

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
annoying that I turned it off and then

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.730 
annoying that I turned it off and then
you<00:01:33.360> get<00:01:33.450> into<00:01:33.600> your<00:01:33.689> settings<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.350> this<00:01:34.619> is

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
you get into your settings and this is

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:35.780 
you get into your settings and this is
where<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:34.979> turn<00:01:35.189> on<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.400> magazine

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
where you turn on the magazine

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.789 
where you turn on the magazine
subscriptions<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.659> if<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.840> look<00:01:36.990> here<00:01:37.320> you

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
subscriptions and if you look here you

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.679 
subscriptions and if you look here you
just<00:01:37.979> check<00:01:38.400> all<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.970> ones<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.420> want<00:01:39.600> to

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
just check all the ones that you want to

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.350 
just check all the ones that you want to
have<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.049> rotate<00:01:40.200> through<00:01:40.850> but<00:01:41.850> that's<00:01:42.060> what's

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
have it rotate through but that's what's

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.760 
have it rotate through but that's what's
different<00:01:42.540> on<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.840> lockscreen

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.530 

overall<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:47.159> device<00:01:47.340> itself<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.180> lot

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
overall the device itself is a lot

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.330 
overall the device itself is a lot
smoother<00:01:49.939> way<00:01:50.939> more<00:01:51.149> fluid<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:52.100> I<00:01:53.100> think

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
smoother way more fluid and I think

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.819 
smoother way more fluid and I think
that's<00:01:53.549> solely<00:01:54.149> because<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.630> KitKat<00:01:55.200> but

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
that's solely because of KitKat but

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.090 
that's solely because of KitKat but
here's<00:01:56.100> something<00:01:56.570> that<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.600> want<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:57.869> show<00:01:58.020> you

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
here's something that I want to show you

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.649 
here's something that I want to show you
that<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.700> I<00:01:59.820> just<00:01:59.850> keep<00:02:00.180> in<00:02:00.299> mind<00:02:00.540> this

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
that is and I just keep in mind this

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.959

your to your device and that's pretty
much<00:04:12.579> what<00:04:12.759> I<00:04:12.790> found<00:04:13.060> different<00:04:13.439> it<00:04:14.439> matches

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:14.889 
much what I found different it matches

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:19.289 
much what I found different it matches
exactly<00:04:15.269> what<00:04:16.269> it<00:04:16.810> says<00:04:17.380> that<00:04:17.620> it<00:04:17.940> it<00:04:18.940> did<00:04:19.180> in

exactly what it says that it it did in

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.870 
exactly what it says that it it did in
the<00:04:19.389> update<00:04:20.400> and<00:04:21.400> then<00:04:21.489> I<00:04:21.519> like<00:04:21.639> about<00:04:21.729> this

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
the update and then I like about this

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.129 
the update and then I like about this
phone<00:04:22.090> though<00:04:22.210> I'm<00:04:22.330> not<00:04:22.419> gonna<00:04:22.599> do<00:04:22.690> a<00:04:22.719> review<00:04:22.779> I

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
phone though I'm not gonna do a review I

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:24.160 
phone though I'm not gonna do a review I
like<00:04:23.409> that<00:04:23.529> I<00:04:23.590> can<00:04:23.740> make<00:04:23.860> the

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.170 
like that I can make the

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:25.720 
like that I can make the
let's<00:04:24.350> disappear<00:04:24.590> and<00:04:25.190> it<00:04:25.340> tells<00:04:25.460> you<00:04:25.580> how<00:04:25.700> to

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
let's disappear and it tells you how to

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:26.920 
let's disappear and it tells you how to
get<00:04:25.910> him<00:04:26.000> back<00:04:26.060> you<00:04:26.300> just<00:04:26.450> swipe<00:04:26.600> up<00:04:26.660> from<00:04:26.810> the

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
get him back you just swipe up from the

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.040 
get him back you just swipe up from the
bottom<00:04:27.020> but<00:04:27.920> adding<00:04:28.550> KitKat<00:04:29.090> to<00:04:29.270> this<00:04:29.450> made<00:04:29.900> it

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
bottom but adding KitKat to this made it

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.260 
bottom but adding KitKat to this made it
a<00:04:30.140> whole<00:04:30.380> bunch<00:04:30.650> a<00:04:30.980> whole<00:04:31.340> lot<00:04:31.520> smoother<00:04:32.060> and

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
a whole bunch a whole lot smoother and

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.150 
a whole bunch a whole lot smoother and
then<00:04:32.600> I'm<00:04:32.690> running<00:04:32.870> Nova<00:04:33.320> Launcher<00:04:33.530> as<00:04:33.890> well

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
then I'm running Nova Launcher as well

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:41.560 
then I'm running Nova Launcher as well
so<00:04:34.700> man<00:04:35.420> I<00:04:35.450> can't<00:04:35.870> go<00:04:36.020> wrong<00:04:39.220> so<00:04:40.220> it<00:04:40.970> says<00:04:41.270> also

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
so man I can't go wrong so it says also

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.660 
so man I can't go wrong so it says also
some<00:04:42.320> optimizations<00:04:43.040> that<00:04:43.130> were<00:04:43.280> done<00:04:43.490> with

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.670 
some optimizations that were done with

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.870 
some optimizations that were done with
KitKat<00:04:44.090> for<00:04:44.330> this<00:04:44.450> device<00:04:44.780> was<00:04:45.740> to<00:04:46.520> free<00:04:46.730> up<00:04:46.850> a

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
KitKat for this device was to free up a

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.790 
KitKat for this device was to free up a
little<00:04:47.030> bit<00:04:47.150> more<00:04:47.270> memory<00:04:50.800> photography

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
little bit more memory photography

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.030 
little bit more memory photography
effects<00:04:52.360> it<00:04:53.360> ops<00:04:53.540> to<00:04:53.750> my<00:04:53.900> optimize<00:04:54.530> the<00:04:54.740> font

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
effects it ops to my optimize the font

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.420 
effects it ops to my optimize the font
display<00:04:55.760> and<00:04:55.940> I<00:04:56.000> mean<00:04:56.120> let<00:04:56.330> me<00:04:56.420> go<00:04:56.570> back<00:04:56.750> to<00:04:57.430> the

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
display and I mean let me go back to the

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.090 
display and I mean let me go back to the
default<00:04:58.760> launcher<00:04:59.240> and<00:04:59.870> one<00:05:00.860> thing<00:05:01.010> about

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
default launcher and one thing about

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.940 
default launcher and one thing about
that<00:05:01.400> before<00:05:02.060> this<00:05:02.480> option<00:05:02.900> to<00:05:03.440> switch<00:05:03.620> here

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 
that before this option to switch here

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.190 
that before this option to switch here
wasn't<00:05:04.400> here<00:05:04.640> so<00:05:04.760> I<00:05:04.820> was<00:05:04.940> going<00:05:05.180> through<00:05:05.360> I<00:05:05.660> was

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
wasn't here so I was going through I was

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.860 
wasn't here so I was going through I was
going<00:05:06.410> through<00:05:06.730> Nova<00:05:07.730> Launcher<00:05:07.880> but<00:05:08.750> as<00:05:08.810> you

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
going through Nova Launcher but as you

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.150 
going through Nova Launcher but as you
can<00:05:08.960> see<00:05:09.020> here<00:05:09.260> the<00:05:09.350> icons<00:05:09.650> look<00:05:09.830> a<00:05:09.860> little<00:05:10.010> bit

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
can see here the icons look a little bit

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.990 
can see here the icons look a little bit
different<00:05:10.520> they're<00:05:10.670> a<00:05:10.700> little<00:05:10.790> bit<00:05:10.970> more

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
different they're a little bit more

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.850 
different they're a little bit more
detailed<00:05:11.540> and<00:05:11.930> they're<00:05:12.080> a<00:05:12.110> little<00:05:12.440> bit<00:05:12.590> bigger

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
detailed and they're a little bit bigger

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.250 
detailed and they're a little bit bigger
it<00:05:13.490> also<00:05:13.640> fixes<00:05:13.970> connectivity<00:05:14.690> issues<00:05:14.990> with

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
it also fixes connectivity issues with

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.230 
it also fixes connectivity issues with
3G<00:05:15.740> obviously<00:05:16.280> F<00:05:16.370> probably<00:05:16.850> doesn't<00:05:17.090> really

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
3G obviously F probably doesn't really

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.200 
3G obviously F probably doesn't really
apply<00:05:17.480> to<00:05:17.600> us<00:05:18.160> it<00:05:19.160> increased<00:05:19.670> the<00:05:19.910> touchscreen

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
apply to us it increased the touchscreen

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.890 
apply to us it increased the touchscreen
sensitivity<00:05:22.150> and<00:05:23.150> I<00:05:23.300> think<00:05:23.540> that's<00:05:23.720> pretty

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
sensitivity and I think that's pretty

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.250 
sensitivity and I think that's pretty
much<00:05:24.460> and<00:05:25.480> it<00:05:26.480> says<00:05:26.660> something<00:05:26.930> else<00:05:26.990> about

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.260 
much and it says something else about

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.500 
much and it says something else about
the<00:05:27.410> noise<00:05:27.650> on<00:05:28.100> the<00:05:28.250> Bluetooth<00:05:28.700> but<00:05:28.940> other

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:29.510 
the noise on the Bluetooth but other

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
the noise on the Bluetooth but other
than<00:05:29.750> that<00:05:29.840> I<00:05:30.200> mean<00:05:30.370> it<00:05:31.370> it<00:05:31.880> pretty<00:05:32.240> much<00:05:32.420> to<00:05:33.260> me

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
than that I mean it it pretty much to me

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.070 
than that I mean it it pretty much to me
the<00:05:34.310> device<00:05:34.610> wasn't<00:05:34.940> sluggish<00:05:35.630> when<00:05:35.780> I<00:05:35.870> first

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
the device wasn't sluggish when I first

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.110 
the device wasn't sluggish when I first
took<00:05:36.260> it<00:05:36.320> out<00:05:36.470> of<00:05:36.560> the<00:05:36.620> box<00:05:36.830> but<00:05:37.700> at<00:05:37.790> the<00:05:37.910> same

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
took it out of the box but at the same

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.480 
took it out of the box but at the same
time<00:05:38.530> it<00:05:40.090> was<00:05:41.090> very<00:05:41.450> fluid<00:05:41.840> it<00:05:41.990> was<00:05:42.370> you<00:05:43.370> know

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
time it was very fluid it was you know

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.090 
time it was very fluid it was you know
it<00:05:43.940> wasn't<00:05:44.750> as<00:05:44.840> smooth<00:05:45.140> as<00:05:45.290> it<00:05:45.410> is<00:05:45.500> right<00:05:45.740> here

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.100 
it wasn't as smooth as it is right here

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:51.040 
it wasn't as smooth as it is right here
obviously<00:05:47.030> but<00:05:48.070> it<00:05:49.070> is<00:05:49.250> very<00:05:49.910> smooth<00:05:50.360> and<00:05:50.750> I

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
obviously but it is very smooth and I

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.770 
obviously but it is very smooth and I
have<00:05:51.470> to<00:05:51.590> admit<00:05:52.000> having<00:05:53.000> kick<00:05:53.270> head<00:05:53.450> on<00:05:53.570> there

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:53.780 
have to admit having kick head on there

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.980 
have to admit having kick head on there
and<00:05:54.050> then<00:05:54.560> me<00:05:54.800> adding<00:05:55.220> the<00:05:55.370> Nova<00:05:55.640> Launcher

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:55.990 
and then me adding the Nova Launcher

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.630 
and then me adding the Nova Launcher
really<00:05:56.990> helped<00:05:57.200> it<00:05:57.290> out<00:05:57.380> but<00:05:57.920> I<00:05:57.950> think<00:05:58.160> the<00:05:58.280> one

00:05:58.630 --> 00:05:58.640 
really helped it out but I think the one

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.120 
really helped it out but I think the one
thing<00:05:58.790> I'm<00:05:58.970> most<00:05:59.150> excited<00:05:59.390> about<00:06:00.130> obviously

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.130 
thing I'm most excited about obviously

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.610 
thing I'm most excited about obviously
is<00:06:01.310> this<00:06:01.490> ultra<00:06:02.090> power<00:06:02.300> saving<00:06:02.450> mode<00:06:03.020> I<00:06:03.320> think

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 
is this ultra power saving mode I think

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:05.890 
is this ultra power saving mode I think
that's<00:06:04.070> a<00:06:04.340> great<00:06:04.940> feature<00:06:05.270> on<00:06:05.450> a<00:06:05.600> phone<00:06:05.870> that

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
that's a great feature on a phone that

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.420 
that's a great feature on a phone that
has<00:06:06.110> a<00:06:06.200> five<00:06:06.530> thousand<00:06:07.040> milliamp<00:06:07.280> battery

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.430 
has a five thousand milliamp battery

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:11.080 
has a five thousand milliamp battery
when<00:06:08.360> I<00:06:08.390> charged<00:06:08.750> it<00:06:08.810> to<00:06:08.930> 100%<00:06:09.730> and<00:06:10.730> by<00:06:10.850> the<00:06:10.910> way

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:11.090 
when I charged it to 100% and by the way

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:12.850 
when I charged it to 100% and by the way
uses<00:06:11.450> the<00:06:11.510> default<00:06:11.630> charger<00:06:12.410> that<00:06:12.560> came<00:06:12.740> in
