kind<00:01:13.850> of<00:01:13.910> tricky<00:01:14.270> but<00:01:14.450> the<00:01:14.510> best<00:01:14.750> way<00:01:14.930> to<00:01:14.960> do

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
kind of tricky but the best way to do

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.670 
kind of tricky but the best way to do
that<00:01:15.410> hold<00:01:16.370> all<00:01:16.670> that<00:01:16.850> like<00:01:17.210> so<00:01:17.510> push<00:01:18.410> down<00:01:18.440> on

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
blaster fist crap about anyways so I'm

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.800 
blaster fist crap about anyways so I'm
going<00:01:58.160> to<00:01:58.280> pull<00:01:58.520> out<00:01:58.730> the<00:01:58.970> instruction

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
going to pull out the instruction

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.750 
going to pull out the instruction
booklet<00:02:00.170> because<00:02:00.620> this<00:02:01.070> is<00:02:01.280> the<00:02:01.490> best

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
booklet because this is the best

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.240 
booklet because this is the best
visualization<00:02:02.480> you<00:02:03.140> could<00:02:03.350> get<00:02:05.650> that<00:02:06.650> circle

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
visualization you could get that circle

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.399 
visualization you could get that circle
basically<00:02:07.569> represents<00:02:08.569> the<00:02:08.840> how<00:02:09.349> the

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:09.409 
basically represents the how the

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:12.839 
basically represents the how the
capturing<00:02:10.310> works<00:02:10.780> so<00:02:11.780> fist<00:02:12.140> would<00:02:12.379> capture

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
capturing works so fist would capture

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.280 
capturing works so fist would capture
the<00:02:13.849> sword<00:02:14.180> sword<00:02:14.569> would<00:02:14.780> capture<00:02:15.019> the

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
the sword sword would capture the

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.839 
the sword sword would capture the
