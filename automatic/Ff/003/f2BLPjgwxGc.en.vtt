00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.850 
too okay so this next hairstyle I
actually<00:02:25.760> originally<00:02:26.630> uploaded<00:02:27.080> last<00:02:27.470> year

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
actually originally uploaded last year

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.070 
actually originally uploaded last year
so<00:02:28.160> i'm<00:02:28.220> reuploading<00:02:28.430> it<00:02:29.150> because<00:02:29.570> you<00:02:29.930> know

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
so i'm reuploading it because you know

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.720 
so i'm reuploading it because you know
the<00:02:30.200> color<00:02:30.410> wasn't<00:02:30.680> that<00:02:30.920> too<00:02:31.130> great<00:02:31.400> so<00:02:31.610> I

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
the color wasn't that too great so I

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.010 
the color wasn't that too great so I
kind<00:02:31.970> of<00:02:32.000> played<00:02:32.120> around<00:02:32.240> with<00:02:32.480> the<00:02:32.630> lighting

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
kind of played around with the lighting

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.810 
kind of played around with the lighting
a<00:02:33.140> bit<00:02:33.350> as<00:02:33.560> well<00:02:33.890> as<00:02:34.130> there<00:02:34.310> wasn't<00:02:34.490> a

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
a bit as well as there wasn't a

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.580 
a bit as well as there wasn't a
voiceover<00:02:35.420> and<00:02:35.960> I<00:02:36.110> really<00:02:36.350> thought<00:02:36.530> I

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
voiceover and I really thought I

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.470 
voiceover and I really thought I
voiceover<00:02:37.190> is<00:02:37.250> necessary<00:02:37.820> and<00:02:37.970> all<00:02:38.090> that<00:02:38.270> so

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
voiceover is necessary and all that so

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.790 
voiceover is necessary and all that so
it's<00:02:38.720> pretty<00:02:38.840> much<00:02:39.080> similar<00:02:39.380> to<00:02:39.590> the

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
it's pretty much similar to the

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.680 
it's pretty much similar to the
hairstyle<00:02:40.220> that<00:02:40.250> we<00:02:40.460> did<00:02:40.640> first<00:02:40.880> but<00:02:41.330> you<00:02:41.480> will

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
hairstyle that we did first but you will

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.140 
hairstyle that we did first but you will
see<00:02:41.930> in<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.290> end<00:02:42.410> why<00:02:42.830> it<00:02:43.190> is<00:02:43.430> different<00:02:43.700> so

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
see in the end why it is different so

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.610 
see in the end why it is different so
these<00:02:44.270> are<00:02:44.450> just<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:44.660> tools<00:02:44.930> i'm<00:02:45.140> using<00:02:45.500> you

so<00:05:56.219> I'm<00:05:56.339> going<00:05:56.460> to<00:05:56.490> begin<00:05:56.610> with<00:05:56.759> kind<00:05:57.629> of

00:05:57.679 --> 00:05:57.689 
so I'm going to begin with kind of

00:05:57.689 --> 00:05:59.719 
so I'm going to begin with kind of
splitting<00:05:58.080> that<00:05:58.349> in<00:05:58.559> half<00:05:58.919> and<00:05:59.279> then<00:05:59.580> I'm

00:05:59.719 --> 00:05:59.729 
splitting that in half and then I'm

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:02.149 
splitting that in half and then I'm
going<00:05:59.849> to<00:05:59.879> begin<00:05:59.999> by<00:06:00.180> taking<00:06:00.689> it<00:06:00.990> and<00:06:01.199> rolling

00:06:02.149 --> 00:06:02.159 
going to begin by taking it and rolling

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:04.129 
going to begin by taking it and rolling
it<00:06:02.249> upwards<00:06:02.879> and<00:06:03.150> that's<00:06:03.330> all<00:06:03.509> we're<00:06:03.869> doing

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:04.139 
it upwards and that's all we're doing

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:06.079 
it upwards and that's all we're doing
here<00:06:04.349> rolling<00:06:04.830> it<00:06:04.979> and<00:06:05.189> kind<00:06:05.399> of<00:06:05.430> twisting<00:06:05.939> it

00:06:06.079 --> 00:06:06.089 
here rolling it and kind of twisting it

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:08.450 
here rolling it and kind of twisting it
upwards<00:06:06.599> and<00:06:06.960> like<00:06:07.469> i<00:06:07.499> said<00:06:07.649> this<00:06:07.889> works<00:06:08.129> best

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
upwards and like i said this works best

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.029 
upwards and like i said this works best
with<00:06:08.939> very<00:06:09.449> textured<00:06:10.229> hair<00:06:10.529> to<00:06:10.889> have

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 
with very textured hair to have

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:13.129 
with very textured hair to have
naturally<00:06:11.520> curly<00:06:11.729> hair<00:06:11.909> I<00:06:12.360> didn't<00:06:12.689> style<00:06:12.960> it

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:13.139
