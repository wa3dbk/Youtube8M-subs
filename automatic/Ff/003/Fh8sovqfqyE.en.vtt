00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
but that's pretty much all of frozen in

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:29.100 
but that's pretty much all of frozen in
there<00:01:26.770> oh<00:01:26.950> one<00:01:27.729> more<00:01:27.880> thing<00:01:27.940> they<00:01:28.570> also<00:01:28.750> come

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
there oh one more thing they also come

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.359 
there oh one more thing they also come
with<00:01:29.140> it's<00:01:29.619> surprising<00:01:30.009> because<00:01:30.100> they<00:01:30.250> come

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
with it's surprising because they come

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:32.370 
with it's surprising because they come
with<00:01:30.400> three<00:01:30.790> and<00:01:31.030> usually<00:01:31.420> when<00:01:31.659> Disney<00:01:32.170> makes

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
with three and usually when Disney makes

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.889 
with three and usually when Disney makes
like<00:01:32.799> they<00:01:33.130> have<00:01:33.250> like<00:01:33.659> like<00:01:34.740> frozen<00:01:35.740> frozen

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
like they have like like frozen frozen

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:38.880 
like they have like like frozen frozen
what's<00:01:37.899> the<00:01:37.990> movie<00:01:38.229> Tangled

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
what's the movie Tangled

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.590 
what's the movie Tangled
and<00:01:39.220> so<00:01:39.460> with<00:01:39.580> that<00:01:39.729> they<00:01:39.909> usually<00:01:40.149> only<00:01:40.330> come

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
and so with that they usually only come

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.170 
and so with that they usually only come
with<00:01:40.690> one<00:01:41.100> but<00:01:42.100> this<00:01:42.340> one<00:01:42.490> came<00:01:42.670> with<00:01:42.700> three<00:01:43.119> I

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
with one but this one came with three I

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.149 
with one but this one came with three I
guess<00:01:43.570> cuz<00:01:43.780> it<00:01:43.899> was<00:01:43.990> so<00:01:44.020> special<00:01:44.409> and<00:01:44.680> like<00:01:44.770> it
