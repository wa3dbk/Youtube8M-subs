00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 
going to do something about that glove I

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.590 
going to do something about that glove I

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
thought firming it was the glove problem

that looks say a reasonably serious cut
has<00:05:45.050> quite<00:05:45.260> long<00:05:45.500> about<00:05:45.920> blood<00:05:46.130> coming<00:05:46.280> over

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:46.640 
has quite long about blood coming over

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.730 
has quite long about blood coming over
know<00:05:46.820> you<00:05:47.510> know<00:05:47.570> look<00:05:47.750> sympathy<00:05:48.200> was<00:05:48.470> of<00:05:48.650> an

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
know you know look sympathy was of an

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:49.380 
know you know look sympathy was of an
inch<00:05:48.890> long

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:49.390 
inch long

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:52.440 
inch long
yeah<00:05:50.390> it<00:05:50.450> was<00:05:50.570> beginning<00:05:50.930> to<00:05:50.960> worry<00:05:51.280> switching

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450 
yeah it was beginning to worry switching

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.240 
yeah it was beginning to worry switching
I<00:05:53.450> would<00:05:54.260> think<00:05:54.410> it<00:05:54.590> would<00:05:54.620> be<00:05:54.770> over<00:05:55.070> by<00:05:55.100> the

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
I would think it would be over by the

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:56.190 
I would think it would be over by the
end<00:05:55.490> of<00:05:55.580> this<00:05:55.730> round

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:56.200 
end of this round

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.990 
end of this round
yes<00:05:57.200> I<00:05:57.320> think<00:05:57.500> that<00:05:57.680> it's<00:05:58.070> a<00:05:58.130> lot<00:05:58.220> more<00:05:58.280> serious

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
yes I think that it's a lot more serious

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.119 
yes I think that it's a lot more serious
than<00:05:59.060> we<00:05:59.300> possibly<00:05:59.450> thought<00:06:00.110> because

00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:01.129 
than we possibly thought because

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:02.949 
than we possibly thought because
no<00:06:01.399> that<00:06:01.550> is<00:06:01.639> starting<00:06:02.089> to<00:06:02.149> bleed<00:06:02.509> we<00:06:02.659> can<00:06:02.839> see

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:02.959 
no that is starting to bleed we can see

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:15.980 
no that is starting to bleed we can see
opening<00:06:03.319> up<00:06:03.439> a<00:06:03.529> little<00:06:03.649> better

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:15.990 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.300 

see<00:06:16.990> this<00:06:17.110> is<00:06:17.259> what<00:06:17.440> Smith<00:06:17.680> could<00:06:17.919> really<00:06:18.129> be

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310 
see this is what Smith could really be

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.480 
see this is what Smith could really be
doing<00:06:18.460> with<00:06:18.729> a<00:06:18.759> lot<00:06:18.970> more<00:06:19.330> power<00:06:19.629> or<00:06:20.160> nice<00:06:21.160> BOTS

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.490 
doing with a lot more power or nice BOTS

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.520 
doing with a lot more power or nice BOTS
a<00:06:21.699> nice<00:06:21.910> move<00:06:22.180> of<00:06:22.360> agent<00:06:22.690> doesn't<00:06:22.960> under<00:06:23.289> power

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:23.530 
a nice move of agent doesn't under power

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:25.170 
a nice move of agent doesn't under power

00:06:28.559 --> 00:06:28.569 
definition about today as we said I

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:30.029 
definition about today as we said I
thought<00:06:28.840> maybe<00:06:29.050> there<00:06:29.289> might<00:06:29.409> better<00:06:29.680> go<00:06:29.889> the

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:30.039 
thought maybe there might better go the

thought maybe there might better go the
end<00:06:30.159> as<00:06:30.280> well<00:06:30.430> but<00:06:30.610> there'd<00:06:30.789> be<00:06:30.849> no<00:06:31.000> point<00:06:31.270> in

00:06:31.529 --> 00:06:31.539
