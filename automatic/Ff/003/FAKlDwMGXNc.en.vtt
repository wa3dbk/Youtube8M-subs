00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
ankles but he can rotate their jointed

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.040 
ankles but he can rotate their jointed
at<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.380> knees<00:02:21.300> looks<00:02:22.300> like<00:02:22.420> it's<00:02:22.570> got<00:02:22.930> the

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
at the knees looks like it's got the

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.200 
at the knees looks like it's got the
multiple<00:02:23.410> jointed<00:02:23.920> hip<00:02:24.550> sockets<00:02:25.030> here<00:02:25.120> he

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
multiple jointed hip sockets here he

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.180 
multiple jointed hip sockets here he
wants<00:02:25.450> a<00:02:25.600> so<00:02:25.660> it's<00:02:25.990> pretty<00:02:26.140> much<00:02:26.230> possible<00:02:27.070> in

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
wants a so it's pretty much possible in

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.490 
wants a so it's pretty much possible in
whichever<00:02:27.430> way<00:02:27.550> you<00:02:27.670> want<00:02:28.770> his<00:02:29.770> hand<00:02:30.420> not

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
whichever way you want his hand not

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.840 
whichever way you want his hand not
rotational<00:02:32.500> I<00:02:32.680> don't<00:02:32.980> okay<00:02:33.520> so<00:02:33.670> it<00:02:33.760> actually

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
rotational I don't okay so it actually

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.990 
rotational I don't okay so it actually
folds<00:02:34.600> in<00:02:34.690> and<00:02:34.840> out<00:02:35.400> kind<00:02:36.400> of<00:02:36.430> got<00:02:36.550> a<00:02:36.580> smaller

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
folds in and out kind of got a smaller

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.750 
folds in and out kind of got a smaller
joint<00:02:37.450> therefore<00:02:37.870> such<00:02:38.080> a<00:02:38.140> big<00:02:38.290> hand<00:02:38.590> but<00:02:38.950> when

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
joint therefore such a big hand but when

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.910 
joint therefore such a big hand but when
I<00:02:39.850> guess<00:02:40.180> you<00:02:40.360> can<00:02:40.450> put<00:02:40.540> a<00:02:40.570> banana<00:02:40.990> in<00:02:41.470> his<00:02:41.620> hand

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
I guess you can put a banana in his hand

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.980 
I guess you can put a banana in his hand
if<00:02:42.070> you<00:02:42.190> wish<00:02:42.520> not<00:02:42.940> positive<00:02:43.510> on<00:02:43.570> that<00:02:43.600> though

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
if you wish not positive on that though

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.940 
if you wish not positive on that though
that's<00:02:44.680> obviously<00:02:45.040> about<00:02:45.280> Camino<00:02:45.580> port<00:02:46.950> his

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
that's obviously about Camino port his

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.620 
that's obviously about Camino port his
other<00:02:48.160> arm<00:02:48.190> doesn't<00:02:48.490> appear<00:02:48.700> to<00:02:48.760> have<00:02:48.850> have

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
other arm doesn't appear to have have

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.280 
other arm doesn't appear to have have
one<00:02:49.900> so<00:02:50.580> looks<00:02:51.580> like<00:02:51.700> as<00:02:51.850> bakunano<00:02:52.480> abilities

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
one so looks like as bakunano abilities

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.760 
one so looks like as bakunano abilities
are<00:02:53.410> pretty<00:02:53.590> limited<00:02:54.060> I'm<00:02:55.060> not<00:02:55.500> sure<00:02:56.500> you<00:02:56.680> can

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
are pretty limited I'm not sure you can

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.800 
are pretty limited I'm not sure you can
put<00:02:56.860> on<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.040> backs<00:02:57.280> turnout<00:02:57.640> but<00:02:57.910> looks<00:02:58.780> like

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
put on the backs turnout but looks like

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.000 
put on the backs turnout but looks like
it's<00:02:59.020> pretty<00:02:59.200> limit<00:02:59.530> with<00:02:59.620> what<00:02:59.710> you<00:02:59.800> can<00:02:59.890> do

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
it's pretty limit with what you can do

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.960 
it's pretty limit with what you can do
with<00:03:00.130> them<00:03:00.250> as<00:03:00.580> far<00:03:00.850> as<00:03:01.000> balcony<00:03:01.420> an<00:03:01.480> old<00:03:01.630> skill

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
with them as far as balcony an old skill

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.970 
with them as far as balcony an old skill
man<00:03:03.970> let's<00:03:04.390> see<00:03:04.480> looks<00:03:05.320> like<00:03:05.350> that<00:03:05.560> might<00:03:05.710> pop

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
man let's see looks like that might pop

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.020 
man let's see looks like that might pop
up<00:03:06.010> when<00:03:06.310> we<00:03:06.430> activate<00:03:06.790> them<00:03:08.820> yeah<00:03:09.820> looks<00:03:09.970> like

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
up when we activate them yeah looks like

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.210 
up when we activate them yeah looks like
we<00:03:10.180> got<00:03:10.330> the<00:03:10.530> multi-jointed<00:03:11.530> shoulders<00:03:11.980> as

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
we got the multi-jointed shoulders as

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.590 
we got the multi-jointed shoulders as
well<00:03:12.250> like<00:03:12.640> the<00:03:12.850> hips<00:03:13.060> but<00:03:14.340> anyways<00:03:15.340> let's<00:03:16.150> use

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600

our<00:03:16.840> middle<00:03:17.260> activating<00:03:18.010> card<00:03:18.850> here<00:03:19.060> and<00:03:19.270> see

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
our middle activating card here and see

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.530 
our middle activating card here and see
what<00:03:19.750> all<00:03:19.870> pops<00:03:20.320> open<00:03:20.560> on<00:03:20.830> him<00:03:21.330> looks<00:03:22.330> like<00:03:22.390> it

what all pops open on him looks like it

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.449 
what all pops open on him looks like it
may<00:03:22.720> just<00:03:22.930> be<00:03:23.020> like<00:03:23.739> something<00:03:23.980> in<00:03:24.250> that<00:03:24.400> area

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
may just be like something in that area

so where's even is g-power Kenny thank G
par<00:03:52.530> doesn't<00:03:53.530> look<00:03:53.709> like<00:03:53.860> it's<00:03:53.980> on<00:03:54.130> the<00:03:54.220> inside

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
par doesn't look like it's on the inside

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.460 
par doesn't look like it's on the inside
there<00:03:54.880> unless<00:03:55.060> I'm<00:03:55.209> just<00:03:55.480> blind<00:03:55.810> it's

there unless I'm just blind it's

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.460 
there unless I'm just blind it's
possible<00:03:57.209> but<00:03:58.209> looks<00:03:58.840> like<00:03:58.930> these<00:03:59.019> are<00:03:59.080> some

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
possible but looks like these are some

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.720 
possible but looks like these are some

sort of Oh up here in the little flap is

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.120 
sort of Oh up here in the little flap is
actually<00:04:04.150> G<00:04:04.269> power<00:04:04.450> he<00:04:04.780> is<00:04:04.810> also<00:04:05.200> turning<00:04:05.530> 20<00:04:05.890> G

actually G power he is also turning 20 G
as<00:04:06.280> was<00:04:06.790> our<00:04:07.030> pirate<00:04:07.450> skies<00:04:07.780> French<00:04:08.140> tech<00:04:09.130> hard

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
as was our pirate skies French tech hard

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.020 
as was our pirate skies French tech hard
to<00:04:09.340> find<00:04:09.489> it<00:04:09.580> there<00:04:09.850> but<00:04:11.010> kind<00:04:12.010> of<00:04:12.130> hidden<00:04:12.400> in<00:04:12.610> a

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
to find it there but kind of hidden in a

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.880 
to find it there but kind of hidden in a
way<00:04:13.180> if<00:04:13.840> you<00:04:14.050> don't<00:04:14.200> pull<00:04:14.380> it<00:04:14.410> down<00:04:14.620> you<00:04:14.739> can

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
way if you don't pull it down you can

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.280 
way if you don't pull it down you can
see<00:04:15.100> the<00:04:15.220> G<00:04:15.519> and<00:04:16.030> the<00:04:16.150> zero<00:04:16.390> is<00:04:16.450> kind<00:04:17.019> of<00:04:17.109> hidden

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
see the G and the zero is kind of hidden

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.330 
see the G and the zero is kind of hidden
not<00:04:17.530> really<00:04:17.799> but<00:04:17.980> he's<00:04:18.820> 220<00:04:19.330> G<00:04:19.890> very<00:04:20.890> limited

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
not really but he's 220 G very limited

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.090 
not really but he's 220 G very limited
on<00:04:21.400> what<00:04:21.430> pops<00:04:21.820> open<00:04:22.080> so<00:04:23.080> I<00:04:23.350> thought<00:04:23.950> maybe

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
on what pops open so I thought maybe

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.340 
on what pops open so I thought maybe
someone<00:04:24.310> here<00:04:24.700> on<00:04:24.760> his<00:04:24.910> chess

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
someone here on his chess

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.580 
someone here on his chess
but<00:04:26.330> okay<00:04:27.330> that<00:04:27.540> folds<00:04:28.080> down<00:04:28.110> shows<00:04:28.440> the

but okay that folds down shows the

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
the magnetic forces you're gonna stay so

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.160
