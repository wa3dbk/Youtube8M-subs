00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.810
 The light of dawn crosses the dense layer of smoke that covers Mexico City 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.700
 where 9 million people live, skyscrapers rise everywhere 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.339
 boosting an economy dedicated to trade and services but around 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:16.169
 of this vertical center 

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:20.359
 there is a lower city that is spreading incessantly in all 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:21.289
 addresses 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.289
 15 million people live around the capital 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:27.999
 the built area grows out of control 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:32.629
 extending up to 2 600 meters in height by the skirts of the 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:36.060
 surrounding volcanoes the orders of mexico 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.330
 that is the son of an acquaintance a national problem 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.310
 remains one of the most important attraction scenes 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.289
 percent in which the migrants 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:46.470
 from the country 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.950
 and that accounts for the great growth that the urban sprawl has had 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.170
 that in just 20 years practically doubled the population so that 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.920
 metropolitan area we already have about 19 million inhabitants 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.650
 centralism that is a characteristic of mexico city is very well 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.580
 exemplified in its wholesale market the large central supply 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.730
 It is a huge market that covers more than three million square meters where 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.760
 more than 70 thousand people work every day is a construction with 45 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:17.630
 passages 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.149
 each one specialized in a product to this market arrive products both 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:26.700
 national as imported, with which not only the capital is supplied but also 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.450
 also the whole country 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.920
 the fish market is a good example in this respect nowhere else in the 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.990
 country it is possible to find the variety of species that are for sale in this 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.659
 market 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.659
 located 300 kilometers from the sea 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.999
 we have the octopus that is believed that the cd captures and campeche and yucatan 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.320
 but they do not hear him in it in the Pacific 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.190
 in those moments at an important moment 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.410
 the costs then 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.650
 well the pl the octopus must rest and took postobÃ³n inclusive 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.460
 because momoa and in other wells or shade of the 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.479
 on the other hand 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.849
 Mexico City is a dynamic city with infrastructures and 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.460
 efficient services for the collection and redistribution of products 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.330
 food is a city with a good retail network that is fine 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.280
 designed is efficient and complies with sanitary and hygienic standards but 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.620
 there is also a marginal peripheral city composed of villas miseria 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.510
 called colonies these 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.950
 are not integrated into the transport and supply networks despite 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.419
 who was born in mexico 

00:02:34.419 --> 00:02:39.090
 the pass 60 percent of the national supply we do not have systems of 

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:41.899
 distribution marketing that guarantee us 

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:46.749
 marginalized population access cheap and good quality food 

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:52.209
 we have detected in its subsoil of this distortion the sense in which 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:53.579
 Commercial stores 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.489
 the basic products are cheaper 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.999
 that in the distribution channels in popular areas the development 

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:04.290
 chaotic and messy of the villas misery reading years the average deficient 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.150
 Of transport 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.569
 the lack of space for trade and storage facilities 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.159
 as well as low income are all responsible factors 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.129
 of the difficulties that poor families face 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:19.549
 when trying to access nutritious and healthy foods 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:27.669
 nixon 

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:29.439
 the cupcake contreras 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:32.259
 it is a terrain 

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:36.079
 alleys and narrow street in the most populated area 

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:40.169
 big canyon 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:42.329
 unevenness of the floor 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.549
 and inaccessibility 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.669
 in the parts 

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:48.669
 the tactics 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:53.679
 this makes the times necessary to go where you are in the 

00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:56.369
 chin almunia 

00:03:56.369 --> 00:04:00.419
 this makes the transport this one pays to come to a market 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:04.049
 a high percentage is 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:05.929
 mile estate 

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:09.929
 local authorities try to allocate spaces for markets 

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:13.069
 street vendors called tianguis like the one we see here 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.359
 located under the power lines unfortunately the food 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.650
 is not usually handled in the most appropriate way in these markets as 

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:24.649
 appreciate yourself in these piles of meat 

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:34.080
 and due to road problems 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.080
 and market did not arrive soon to the carrot 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:39.330
 is and there are those who 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.840
 with fifteen or twenty days with more delay after being removed 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:46.059
 it's over 

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:47.449
 capacity 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:48.809
 min 

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:52.210
 half of the territory of the federal district is rural 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.449
 despite this 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:56.449
 agriculture is disappearing in suburban areas 

00:04:57.059 --> 00:05:01.349
 the price of land is so high that farmers simply can not 

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:05.309
 resist the purchase offers and are abandoning food production 

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:09.600
 only some products with a good sales niche like amaranth resist 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.610
 a prehispanic vegetable with high nutritional value 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.980
 and the nopal whose tasty leaves 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.980
 they also have a strong demand in the cosmetics industry 

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:22.879
 Another crucial problem is the lack of water, the water reserves that are 

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:27.370
 disposes are being used excessively the water is usually contaminated as 

00:05:27.369 --> 00:05:29.620
 It shows Lake Milky jochy 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.110
 what is left of an old lagoon 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.110
 on whose shores the original Aztec city was founded 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:40.860
 trasona that is practically copada with the city of mexico 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.190
 however good is still one of the six rural delegations 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.900
 Etienne agricultural land 

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:49.939
 almost a 

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:51.770
 30% lights 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.379
 they sound zone still verbeek that supplies water the big city 

00:05:56.379 --> 00:06:00.180
 currently the lake is surrounded by lots dedicated to intensive cultivation 

00:06:00.179 --> 00:06:01.669
 of vegetables 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:05.569
 these agricultural products are grown in artificial plots surrounded by 

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:09.909
 channels this farming system is called chinampa 

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:10.879
 However 

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:14.639
 the illegal settlements that are invading the chinampas and the water of the 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:17.639
 lake is being contaminated with sewage 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.129
 the biggest drop keeps going forward all this are also had a fabulator 

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:26.330
 they are irregular there is a law 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:27.499
 of ecology 

00:06:27.499 --> 00:06:31.339
 detailed that the component one of practices in this environment or in the 

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:34.540
 fifth entry as you can see 

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.169
 even though it is prohibited 

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:40.740
 people continue to build is a struggle between those who want ytn and the authority
