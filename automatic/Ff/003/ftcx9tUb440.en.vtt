00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
trigger guard so and I did think this

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.960 
trigger guard so and I did think this
was<00:05:09.960> kind<00:05:10.320> of<00:05:10.380> dumb<00:05:10.620> they<00:05:11.040> should<00:05:11.280> reinvent

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
was kind of dumb they should reinvent

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.490 
was kind of dumb they should reinvent
this<00:05:12.300> because<00:05:12.750> it<00:05:13.470> was<00:05:13.620> kind<00:05:13.919> of<00:05:14.040> hard<00:05:14.250> to<00:05:15.500> open

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
this because it was kind of hard to open

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.740 
this because it was kind of hard to open

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
finally I thought that was a flaw right

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.010 
finally I thought that was a flaw right
there<00:05:40.950> cuz<00:05:41.310> when<00:05:42.300> you<00:05:42.360> need<00:05:42.510> to<00:05:42.570> open<00:05:42.720> that

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
there cuz when you need to open that

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.680 
there cuz when you need to open that
fast<00:05:43.410> and<00:05:43.800> this<00:05:44.430> is<00:05:44.580> also<00:05:44.760> the<00:05:44.970> trigger<00:05:45.510> is

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
fast and this is also the trigger is

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.830 
fast and this is also the trigger is
missing<00:05:46.080> but<00:05:46.620> this<00:05:47.100> opens<00:05:47.490> up<00:05:47.640> to<00:05:48.030> unprotect

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:48.840 
missing but this opens up to unprotect

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.650 
missing but this opens up to unprotect
the<00:05:48.900> trigger<00:05:49.169> and<00:05:49.430> for<00:05:50.430> using<00:05:50.940> gloves<00:05:51.210> you

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
the trigger and for using gloves you

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.469 
the trigger and for using gloves you
it's<00:05:52.560> a<00:05:52.740> lot<00:05:52.919> easy<00:05:53.250> and<00:05:53.640> it<00:05:54.000> closed<00:05:54.210> that<00:05:54.450> I

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 
it's a lot easy and it closed that I

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:58.670
