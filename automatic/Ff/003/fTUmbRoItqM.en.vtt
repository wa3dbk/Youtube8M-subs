00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
hear the leaks right now somewhere

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.969 
hear the leaks right now somewhere
around<00:04:44.250> here<00:04:45.110> there<00:04:46.110> you<00:04:46.199> go<00:04:46.349> you<00:04:46.410> can<00:04:46.620> say

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
around here there you go you can say

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:53.839 
around here there you go you can say
it's<00:04:47.720> such<00:04:48.720> a<00:04:48.750> really<00:04:49.110> bad<00:04:50.479> welding<00:04:51.479> job<00:04:51.780> I<00:04:52.849> can

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:53.849 
it's such a really bad welding job I can

00:04:53.849 --> 00:05:02.469 
it's such a really bad welding job I can
just<00:04:54.530> fix<00:04:55.530> it<00:04:55.740> later<00:04:55.949> or<00:04:57.680> maybe<00:04:58.680> I<00:04:58.889> don't<00:04:59.039> know

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:02.479 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:08.930 

yeah<00:05:03.509> so<00:05:05.090> 25<00:05:06.090> to<00:05:06.659> 30<00:05:07.020> bucks<00:05:07.349> blow<00:05:07.919> off<00:05:08.099> all<00:05:08.370> it's

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
yeah so 25 to 30 bucks blow off all it's

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.059 
yeah so 25 to 30 bucks blow off all it's
it's<00:05:09.810> pretty<00:05:09.960> good<00:05:10.169> pretty<00:05:10.380> decent<00:05:10.770> price

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:13.069 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:16.480 

let's<00:05:14.069> see<00:05:14.280> if<00:05:14.400> it<00:05:14.520> still<00:05:14.789> holds<00:05:14.940> more

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
let's see if it still holds more

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.600 
let's see if it still holds more
hopefully<00:05:17.490> it<00:05:17.580> doesn't<00:05:17.880> explode<00:05:18.210> again<00:05:18.659> so

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
hopefully it doesn't explode again so

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.980 
hopefully it doesn't explode again so
we'll<00:05:20.610> see<00:05:20.849> just<00:05:21.060> a<00:05:21.599> little<00:05:21.780> bit<00:05:21.900> more<00:05:23.990> let's

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
we'll see just a little bit more let's

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.749 
we'll see just a little bit more let's
say<00:05:25.610> that's<00:05:26.610> it<00:05:26.870> that's<00:05:27.870> it<00:05:28.110> 30<00:05:28.639> all<00:05:29.639> right

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 
say that's it that's it 30 all right

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:32.059 
say that's it that's it 30 all right
we're<00:05:29.940> gonna<00:05:30.060> see<00:05:30.330> how<00:05:30.810> it's<00:05:31.139> going<00:05:31.740> to<00:05:31.949> the

00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:32.069 
we're gonna see how it's going to the

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:42.090 
we're gonna see how it's going to the
water

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.100 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.440 

there<00:05:42.730> you<00:05:42.790> go<00:05:43.710> as<00:05:44.710> you<00:05:44.770> can<00:05:45.100> see<00:05:45.460> it<00:05:45.850> is<00:05:46.090> just

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:46.450 
there you go as you can see it is just

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:50.610 
there you go as you can see it is just
the<00:05:46.780> welding<00:05:47.460> and<00:05:49.140> nothing<00:05:50.140> else

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620 
the welding and nothing else

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.650 
the welding and nothing else
yeah<00:05:51.070> I'm<00:05:51.340> surprised<00:05:51.820> too<00:05:52.120> it's<00:05:53.340> $30<00:05:54.340> for<00:05:55.300> the

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:55.660 
yeah I'm surprised too it's $30 for the

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.220 
yeah I'm surprised too it's $30 for the
plugs

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:58.230 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:02.190 

it's<00:05:59.230> not<00:05:59.350> even<00:05:59.560> leaking<00:06:00.960> I'm<00:06:01.960> really

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:02.200 
it's not even leaking I'm really

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:07.170 
it's not even leaking I'm really
surprised<00:06:02.560> if<00:06:03.810> you<00:06:04.810> get<00:06:04.980> the<00:06:05.980> HKS<00:06:06.670> one<00:06:06.940> it's

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:07.180 
surprised if you get the HKS one it's

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:13.440 
surprised if you get the HKS one it's
really<00:06:08.020> identical<00:06:08.620> but<00:06:09.810> this<00:06:10.810> is<00:06:10.960> holds<00:06:12.450> just

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:13.450 
really identical but this is holds just

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:26.360 
really identical but this is holds just
good<00:06:13.690> price<00:06:13.930> of<00:06:14.140> it<00:06:17.070> no<00:06:18.070> leaks<00:06:18.400> no<00:06:18.640> nothing

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.950 

actually<00:06:27.370> not<00:06:27.520> so<00:06:27.700> bad<00:06:27.730> yeah<00:06:28.300> I<00:06:28.600> would<00:06:28.930> just

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 
actually not so bad yeah I would just

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.260 
actually not so bad yeah I would just
suggest<00:06:29.290> you<00:06:29.950> get<00:06:30.100> this<00:06:30.340> version<00:06:30.670> into

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.270 
suggest you get this version into

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.580 
suggest you get this version into
instead<00:06:31.660> of<00:06:31.720> the<00:06:32.020> you<00:06:32.800> know<00:06:32.920> the<00:06:33.070> love<00:06:34.590> with

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:35.590 
instead of the you know the love with

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.020 
instead of the you know the love with
this<00:06:35.890> tribe<00:06:36.430> over<00:06:37.500> this<00:06:38.500> side<00:06:38.800> you'll<00:06:39.790> see

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.030 
this tribe over this side you'll see

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.690 
this tribe over this side you'll see
what<00:06:40.210> I<00:06:40.240> mean<00:06:40.620> that<00:06:41.620> one<00:06:41.830> actually<00:06:42.040> really<00:06:42.520> bad

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:42.700 
what I mean that one actually really bad

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:50.430 
what I mean that one actually really bad
quality<00:06:43.650> this<00:06:44.650> is<00:06:44.830> built<00:06:45.130> pretty<00:06:45.730> good<00:06:46.050> and<00:06:49.440> no

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:50.440 
quality this is built pretty good and no

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.990 
quality this is built pretty good and no
leaks<00:06:51.450> on<00:06:52.450> the<00:06:52.600> block

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 
leaks on the block

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:01.040 
leaks on the block
yeah<00:06:56.430> so<00:06:57.430> what<00:06:58.180> we're<00:06:58.360> sitting<00:06:58.780> right<00:06:58.810> now

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.050 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:06.120 

Ryan<00:07:02.050> I<00:07:02.260> was<00:07:02.380> about<00:07:02.860> 25<00:07:03.610> psi<00:07:04.620> curse<00:07:05.620> of<00:07:05.920> it's

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:06.130 
Ryan I was about 25 psi curse of it's

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:07.640 
Ryan I was about 25 psi curse of it's
leaking

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:07.650 
leaking

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:15.420 
leaking
try<00:07:08.650> it<00:07:08.710> again<00:07:13.290> right<00:07:14.290> now<00:07:14.380> it's<00:07:14.530> 35<00:07:15.010> actually

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:15.430 
try it again right now it's 35 actually

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:19.680 
try it again right now it's 35 actually
I'm<00:07:15.490> surprised<00:07:15.880> still<00:07:16.450> holding<00:07:16.810> the<00:07:17.080> PSI<00:07:18.690> all

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:19.690 
I'm surprised still holding the PSI all

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:20.630 
I'm surprised still holding the PSI all
right

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:20.640 
right

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:28.770 
right
so<00:07:22.350> also<00:07:23.350> people<00:07:23.680> say<00:07:23.710> that<00:07:27.210> you<00:07:28.210> get<00:07:28.480> what<00:07:28.660> you

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:28.780 
so also people say that you get what you

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:34.130 
so also people say that you get what you
pay<00:07:28.990> for<00:07:29.020> but<00:07:30.270> in<00:07:31.270> this<00:07:31.390> case<00:07:31.690> that's<00:07:32.350> not<00:07:32.560> true

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:34.140 
pay for but in this case that's not true

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:37.020 
pay for but in this case that's not true
sometimes<00:07:35.140> cheap<00:07:35.530> way<00:07:35.710> is<00:07:35.770> the<00:07:36.100> best<00:07:36.310> way<00:07:36.580> for

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:37.030 
sometimes cheap way is the best way for

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:41.510 
sometimes cheap way is the best way for
you<00:07:37.150> for<00:07:37.750> your<00:07:37.810> money<00:07:37.990> I<00:07:38.200> guess

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:41.520 

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:48.450 

all<00:07:42.520> right<00:07:42.640> I<00:07:42.700> guess<00:07:42.910> you<00:07:43.180> guys<00:07:43.330> later<00:07:45.450> why
