 the first one more day gone to the web of 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.660
 facilisimo.com 

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:12.580
 I am marina in the most beautiful channel and 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.490
 Today I am going to show you how you made two 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:18.970
 homemade face masks both 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:21.419
 for oily and dry skin 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.970
 two types of very nutritious masks 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:27.910
 exfoliating and leaving a finish of a 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.590
 Perfect face and nice look if 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:40.120
 you want to see how I do it 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:44.050
 watch the video as a disinfectant and 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:47.620
 refreshing will also help 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:51.010
 it's a sugar place that acts like a 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.649
 natural exfoliant and honey that cleans 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.140
 skin in rotunidad and also eliminates 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:58.899
 toxins in addition it is also very moisturizing 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.620
 and nutritious simply what we have 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:06.390
 what to do is all very well and we are going to 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.390
 do a little bit to weld the skin 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.429
 and we are going to change the software 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:28.700
 much more 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.479
