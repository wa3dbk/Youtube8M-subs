the off screen buttons but it is a good

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.650 
the off screen buttons but it is a good
start<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.460> just<00:00:50.820> wanted<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.270> show<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.510> guys

start I just wanted to show you guys

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.369 
start I just wanted to show you guys
that<00:00:52.100> the<00:00:53.100> ROM<00:00:53.879> development<00:00:54.449> has<00:00:54.629> started<00:00:55.170> for

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
that the ROM development has started for

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.560 
that the ROM development has started for
the<00:00:55.500> scene<00:00:55.770> 1<00:00:56.280> plus<00:00:56.489> 2<00:00:56.670> so<00:00:56.850> we<00:00:56.969> can<00:00:57.120> expect<00:00:57.449> a

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
the scene 1 plus 2 so we can expect a

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.349 
the scene 1 plus 2 so we can expect a
lot<00:00:57.930> more<00:00:57.989> arms<00:00:58.500> on<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.680> 1+2<00:00:59.250> they<00:01:00.000> put<00:01:00.239> the

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
lot more arms on the 1+2 they put the

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.290 
lot more arms on the 1+2 they put the
device<00:01:00.690> model<00:01:01.170> number<00:01:01.410> SD<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:02.070> two<00:01:02.520> double<00:01:03.090> zero

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
device model number SD a two double zero

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.479 
device model number SD a two double zero
one<00:01:03.510> but<00:01:04.229> we<00:01:04.619> are<00:01:04.710> getting<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.979> different<00:01:05.159> model

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
one but we are getting a different model

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.580 
one but we are getting a different model
number<00:01:05.850> for<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.180> Indian<00:01:06.990> variant<00:01:07.380> way<00:01:07.560> I

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
number for the Indian variant way I

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.330 
number for the Indian variant way I
guess<00:01:07.950> for<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.159> 2<00:01:08.250> double<00:01:08.700> 03<00:01:09.439> but<00:01:10.439> all<00:01:11.040> in<00:01:11.220> all

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
guess for a 2 double 03 but all in all

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.870 
guess for a 2 double 03 but all in all
it<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:11.970> working<00:01:12.210> reading<00:01:12.810> fine<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.760> most<00:01:14.760> of

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
it is working reading fine and most of

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.980 
it is working reading fine and most of
the<00:01:15.030> customization<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:15.930> present

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
the customization is present

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.679 
the customization is present

I<00:01:37.240> personally<00:01:37.630> used<00:01:38.200> a<00:01:38.409> lot<00:01:38.590> of<00:01:38.770> phones<00:01:39.460> with

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
I personally used a lot of phones with

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.480 
I personally used a lot of phones with
mock<00:01:39.939> you<00:01:40.090> know<00:01:40.240> on<00:01:40.420> it<00:01:40.570> and<00:01:40.830> it<00:01:41.830> is<00:01:42.310> also

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
mock you know on it and it is also

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.210 
mock you know on it and it is also
supporting<00:01:43.090> themes<00:01:43.330> from<00:01:43.570> the<00:01:43.979> first<00:01:44.979> bill

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
supporting themes from the first bill

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.639 
supporting themes from the first bill
which<00:01:45.850> is<00:01:46.000> good<00:01:46.179> because<00:01:46.390> it<00:01:46.570> is<00:01:47.140> missing<00:01:47.560> on

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
which is good because it is missing on

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:50.010 
which is good because it is missing on
the<00:01:47.830> confluence<00:01:48.580> oxygen<00:01:49.030> OS<00:01:49.209> and<00:01:49.539> in<00:01:49.690> the<00:01:49.840> near

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
the confluence oxygen OS and in the near

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.289 
the confluence oxygen OS and in the near
future<00:01:50.049> I<00:01:50.500> will<00:01:50.560> do<00:01:50.920> I<00:01:50.950> will<00:01:51.190> keep<00:01:51.340> an<00:01:51.700> eye<00:01:52.119> on

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
future I will do I will keep an eye on

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:54.809 
future I will do I will keep an eye on
it<00:01:52.479> and<00:01:52.780> if<00:01:53.350> we<00:01:53.770> get<00:01:53.920> major<00:01:54.159> update<00:01:54.640> with

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:54.819 
it and if we get major update with

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:56.940 
it and if we get major update with
fingerprint<00:01:55.299> sensor<00:01:55.659> and<00:01:55.810> all<00:01:55.959> so<00:01:56.470> I<00:01:56.500> will<00:01:56.799> be

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
fingerprint sensor and all so I will be

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.779 
fingerprint sensor and all so I will be
making<00:01:57.759> a<00:01:57.970> video<00:01:58.149> related<00:01:58.509> to<00:01:58.720> death<00:01:58.959> and

custom recovery and everything there

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:06.419
