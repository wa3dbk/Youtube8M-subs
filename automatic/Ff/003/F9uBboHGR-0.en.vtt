00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.440
 hello to us on the test came sony 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.300
 xperia v 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.920
 I had the opportunity to meet 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.349
 devices to work with him a little more 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.420
 in September, and then he called it the 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.090
 interesting phone company sony this 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.970
 years in the yard December frost have a minus 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.269
 The 35 x period is still the most 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.730
 interesting phone sony this year 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:27.990
 finally he got to us and we about him 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.390
 all tell and show 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.669
 let's start by unpacking see 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.250
 what's inside the box itself 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.120
 the box is very small by the way 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:42.510
 for comparison xperia sola box 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:48.750
 so here is the xperia acro s box 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:51.750
 like so thin and and but contains inside 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.949
 many interesting things we have a phone 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.239
 white color 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.770
 there is still a black version and pink 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:02.489
 that's how it looks now on black 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.949
 rear white price is 25,000 rubles 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.860
 or to the company says 24 1900 rubles 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.400
 such a psychological moment does not seem to be 25 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.960
 A 24 phone is easy because there is no 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.960
 batteries let's pay attention to 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.330
 back cover here instruction sticker 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.619
 scheme how to close the lid 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.380
 put pressure on these parts 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.110
 to tight everything closed and was 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.080
 tightly 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:30.380
 the cover is removed from the bottom removes say 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.380
 very easy 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:38.939
 here is an airtight carriage goes rubber 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:45.909
 sudan deepening grooves 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:48.390
 lays down a battery capacity up to 800 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:51.479
 its capacity is 1,700 milliamperes an hour and 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:56.679
 by the way you need to stick 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:02:00.069
 micro-sim megaphone narrowly with 4g xperia vip 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:04.209
 supports lte networks and russian lt and 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:05.939
 so try to check how things are 

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:08.829
 works on xperia we 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.840
 memory card slot is here 

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:12.069
 here 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.459
 curious construction at first did not understand 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:20.380
 where is that inserted well 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:25.600
 and battery up 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:30.910
 all now according to the instructions at the top 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:33.670
 I clicked everywhere on the sides in the center 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.950
 everything closed well if we will 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.820
 bathe the apparatus under the water then it is not 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:44.680
 must drown and so on to turn on the holes 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:47.370
 must be on the type label before the first 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.940
 switching on it is necessary to charge the device 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:54.520
 what else is there to raise the lid for some reason 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.740
 why charge if there are no batteries there 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.540
 never mind 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.850
 charger unit called it 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:04.090
 and p880 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.250
 1500 milliamp battery output here 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.900
 Ie 1700 mA charging 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:13.200
 the unit will be in about an hour and 20 minutes 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.200
 microusb cable 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:20.160
 usual not 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:21.790
 l-shaped note headphones 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.340
 mh750 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.120
 sony mobile site on someone that 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:30.820
 the bundle goes image 657 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.490
 perhaps this distinction is regional and 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:36.250
 the device we have is designed for some 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:38.980
 European country since the design 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:43.260
 in Russian, I do not see us 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.260
 some euro test test kit 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:50.530
 you can not lower the phone ocean swim in 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.690
 basin to dive to a depth of more 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.620
 one meter 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:04:00.520
 it is impossible to wash it with soap 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:03.130
 lowered into the mud and boiling telefonchik 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:08.430
 protected but of course it's such 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.430
 degree we have silicone lining 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:20.489
 booted up our smartphone ritually take off 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:20.489
 plenochku like so the first run 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:28.570
 you must select the language waist 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:31.710
 agree with the terms of some so 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.710
 only wifi 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:37.090
 account and everything is ready to work our 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.140
 his diagonal phone is 4 3 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.460
 inch resolution 1280 by 720 pixels 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:45.630
 high memory pixel density not 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:48.270
 I remember about 340 something pi pi ah 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:51.760
 front camera is present 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:54.780
 a nice lattice of keys under the display 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.780
 no and not virtual 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.070
 So 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:06.640
 I want to adjust the brightness 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.640
 higher 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:19.930
 nicely in the hand arch-shaped design 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:26.330
 the phone is smart inside him 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:29.050
 snapdragon s4 dual core 1 and 5 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:32.180
 gigahertz 1 gigabyte of ram and 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:36.730
 internal memory in my 8 gigabytes with 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.730
 expandable via micro sd 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:46.450
 Adding widgets come this way 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:49.310
 way recently launched application 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:52.820
 Walton branded programs from movies 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:56.480
 album camera here is 13 megapixels here 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:06:00.020
 she's a beauty is sure to see how 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:02.960
 it takes a lot of different modes here 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:06.970
 should be interesting and filters such 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:09.290
 how tilt-shift this miniature 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:12.640
 miniature items are obtained which 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:18.970
 we take a picture of a toy as if 

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:22.120
 so here I put 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:22.120
 live wallpaper 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.910
 see how xperia handles them 

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:32.560
 p 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:36.160
 cosmic flow those who worked with xperia s 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:38.290
 and he or acres know what's on these live 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:41.130
 both of these devices slow down 

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:44.620
 snapdragon s3 doesn't do much 

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:47.560
 them but i see it fly amazingly 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:50.620
 when we have x go to was on review 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:52.420
 and maxim said another reviewer that he 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:55.390
 do not slow down work faster than galaxy 

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:58.090
 s3 I like that I do not particularly believe it Well 

00:06:55.390 --> 00:07:00.220
 Now here's a pumpkin in xperia wines and believe 

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:05.400
 the couple is really very fast not straight 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:07.810
 it is believed that so smart apparatik 

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:10.570
 We will try of course in the benchmarks but 

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:11.970
 more important than how the device shows itself 

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:15.550
 in real work in real tests 

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:20.380
 In addition, along with xperia we got us 

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:22.030
 xperia acro s and make a comparison by 

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:25.090
 performance just the same 

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:29.410
 estimate how much your xperia ion or 

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:32.890
 acres slower xperia tx with it seems 

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:34.540
 The filling of the camera is also comparable if 

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:36.640
 the difference between 12 megapixel my 

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:39.790
 xperia camera phones of the past 

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:42.160
 generations and 13 megapixel in the current 

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:42.870
 generation in general will be interesting to me 

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.920
 thought 

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:48.540
 thank you for your attention subscribe 

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:48.540
 comment and goodbye
