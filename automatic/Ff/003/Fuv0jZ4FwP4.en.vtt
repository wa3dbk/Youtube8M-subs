 piglet that says there are no tools 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.270
 very good and decided to buy 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.330
 to experiment 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.570
 I understand absolutely nothing from hacksaw. 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.519

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.739
 long ago even though he was

 child and a person saying that the 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.690
 serrote was good when he sang 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.129
 I got it right, I decided to take a test. 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.120
 here since we know how to do that 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.120
 can of cancan 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.420
 ta 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.309
 I think we could organize and 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.840
 make a party of mgm né saw 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.050

 very cool, I decided to buy it but he 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.790
 also knowing how to use 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.280
 I thought it was a legal tool and 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.820
 now very recently a matter of days 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.130
 We bought this job. 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:30.210
 I think that 's the exact name 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:36.690
 Japanese indication of mato piglet that already 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:39.660

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:51.930
 very beautiful and I make small 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:55.229
 cuts here on the wood and we bought them 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.080
 as if it were as arora was rest 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:01.170

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:08.899
 content as it used to sell a 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.899
 heavy structure 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.410
 Let's do some testing on it with just one 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.940
 to get an idea of ​​these tools 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.940

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.670

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:22.970
 a car is great is not where we 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:46.579
 brought the united states side ne 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:50.260

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:50.260
 people realize it's glaring right 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:56.959

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:01.299
 pulling 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:20.280
 stores these bands well 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:23.120
 since the worsening of health is rising but 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.120
 take a look 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:38.729

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:40.919
 with this tool and finally we will 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.600
 a cut with the river dove 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:05:06.950

00:04:42.600 --> 00:05:06.950
