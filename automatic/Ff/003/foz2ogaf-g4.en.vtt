00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
and throw it in the pan so how you know

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.410 
and throw it in the pan so how you know
when<00:00:58.379> it's<00:00:58.530> time<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.920> put<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.879> egg<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.239> there

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
when it's time to put the egg in there

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.119 
when it's time to put the egg in there
is<00:01:00.930> just<00:01:01.260> when<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.559> butter<00:01:01.800> has<00:01:02.100> melted

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
is just when that butter has melted

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.880 
is just when that butter has melted
nicely<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.989> starts<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.409> get<00:01:04.530> that<00:01:04.710> little

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
nicely and it starts to get that little

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.920 
nicely and it starts to get that little
bubbling<00:01:05.309> effect<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:06.240> actually<00:01:06.390> if<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.750> look

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
bubbling effect and actually if you look

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.750 
bubbling effect and actually if you look
in<00:01:07.080> here<00:01:07.110> now<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.470> can<00:01:07.740> see<00:01:07.890> how<00:01:08.310> it's<00:01:08.490> just

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
in here now you can see how it's just

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.090 
in here now you can see how it's just
starting<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.210> get<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.479> bubble<00:01:09.930> quite<00:01:10.799> nicely

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
starting to get that bubble quite nicely

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.580 
starting to get that bubble quite nicely
just<00:01:11.460> like<00:01:11.670> so<00:01:12.080> so<00:01:13.080> when<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.320> get<00:01:13.439> that

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
just like so so when you get that

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.630 
just like so so when you get that
bubbling<00:01:13.890> going<00:01:14.159> on<00:01:16.070> simply<00:01:17.070> crack<00:01:17.280> your<00:01:17.490> egg

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.030 

now<00:01:25.060> the<00:01:25.840> most<00:01:26.020> important<00:01:26.500> thing<00:01:26.530> to<00:01:26.799> remember

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
want to hang on to the pan so just a

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.290 
want to hang on to the pan so just a
medium<00:01:37.750> low<00:01:38.080> heat<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:39.520> all<00:01:39.700> you<00:01:39.820> really<00:01:40.000> need

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
medium low heat is all you really need

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.320 
medium low heat is all you really need

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
so as you can see the egg is poured out

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.200 
so as you can see the egg is poured out
nice<00:01:43.600> and<00:01:43.630> white<00:01:44.380> just<00:01:44.860> like<00:01:45.040> so<00:01:45.310> and<00:01:45.850> look<00:01:46.090> at

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
nice and white just like so and look at

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.990 
nice and white just like so and look at
how<00:01:46.360> it<00:01:46.509> just<00:01:46.659> moves<00:01:46.930> around<00:01:47.110> in<00:01:47.440> the<00:01:47.470> pan<00:01:48.000> nice

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
and easy so you just don't need a lot of

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.920 
and easy so you just don't need a lot of
heat<00:01:52.799> okay<00:01:53.799> and<00:01:54.190> then<00:01:54.640> what<00:01:54.790> I<00:01:54.820> always<00:01:55.000> do<00:01:55.299> when

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
heat okay and then what I always do when

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.900 
heat okay and then what I always do when
the<00:01:56.080> pan<00:01:56.289> when<00:01:56.649> the<00:01:56.770> egg<00:01:56.890> is<00:01:57.039> ready<00:01:57.160> to<00:01:57.340> flip

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:57.910 
the pan when the egg is ready to flip

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.180 
the pan when the egg is ready to flip
I<00:01:57.940> flipped<00:01:58.479> the<00:01:58.600> end<00:01:58.720> turn<00:01:59.320> the<00:01:59.470> heat<00:01:59.649> off<00:01:59.679> and

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190
