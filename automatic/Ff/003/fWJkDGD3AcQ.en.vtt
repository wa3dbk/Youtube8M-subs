00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
night I don't know and the thing on the

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.280 
night I don't know and the thing on the
left<00:02:43.100> that's<00:02:43.580> what<00:02:44.000> scar<00:02:44.360> was<00:02:44.540> doing<00:02:44.990> he<00:02:45.140> was

left that's what scar was doing he was

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.140 
left that's what scar was doing he was
moving<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:45.800> things<00:02:46.040> to<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:46.340> side<00:02:46.550> and<00:02:46.910> that's

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
moving the things to the side and that's

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.900 
moving the things to the side and that's
a<00:02:47.450> lot<00:02:47.960> easier<00:02:48.470> to<00:02:48.650> do<00:02:48.860> if<00:02:49.160> I<00:02:49.430> mean<00:02:49.580> it's<00:02:49.700> a<00:02:49.760> lot

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
a lot easier to do if I mean it's a lot

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.060 
a lot easier to do if I mean it's a lot
easier<00:02:50.180> to<00:02:50.330> do<00:02:50.480> that<00:02:50.720> side<00:02:51.380> on<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:51.680> Left<00:02:51.890> if

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
easier to do that side on the Left if

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.440 
easier to do that side on the Left if
you<00:02:52.190> have<00:02:52.280> two<00:02:52.460> players<00:02:52.730> because<00:02:53.210> there's<00:02:53.390> a

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
you have two players because there's a

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.330 
you have two players because there's a
trick<00:02:53.780> you<00:02:54.020> can<00:02:54.170> do<00:02:54.560> and<00:02:54.890> I<00:02:55.010> don't<00:02:55.070> know<00:02:55.220> if

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
trick you can do and I don't know if

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.040 
trick you can do and I don't know if
it's<00:02:55.490> a<00:02:55.700> trick<00:02:55.970> or<00:02:56.180> if<00:02:56.300> they've<00:02:56.450> meant<00:02:56.750> to<00:02:56.870> put

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
it's a trick or if they've meant to put

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.650 
it's a trick or if they've meant to put
it<00:02:57.170> in<00:02:57.290> but<00:02:57.590> it's<00:02:58.550> a<00:02:58.730> lot<00:02:58.940> easier<00:02:58.970> than<00:02:59.510> having

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
it in but it's a lot easier than having

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.590 
it in but it's a lot easier than having
to<00:02:59.810> build<00:03:00.140> the<00:03:00.440> staircase<00:03:01.010> and<00:03:01.340> you<00:03:02.210> need<00:03:02.420> the

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
to build the staircase and you need the

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.100 
to build the staircase and you need the
commander<00:03:03.200> to<00:03:03.350> get<00:03:03.470> up<00:03:03.590> there<00:03:03.800> so<00:03:04.130> you<00:03:04.220> can

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
commander to get up there so you can

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.840 
commander to get up there so you can
pull<00:03:06.110> down<00:03:06.290> this<00:03:06.500> thing<00:03:06.830> later<00:03:07.340> on<00:03:07.580> but<00:03:07.730> I'll

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
pull down this thing later on but I'll

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.580 
pull down this thing later on but I'll
talk<00:03:08.030> about<00:03:08.090> that<00:03:08.510> when<00:03:08.690> we<00:03:08.840> get<00:03:09.080> to<00:03:09.290> it<00:03:09.380> in<00:03:09.500> a

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
talk about that when we get to it in a

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
talk about that when we get to it in a
couple<00:03:09.950> of<00:03:10.100> minutes

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
couple of minutes

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.430 
couple of minutes
and<00:03:10.730> this<00:03:11.330> whole<00:03:11.540> level<00:03:11.840> is<00:03:11.930> actually<00:03:12.200> kind<00:03:12.380> of

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
and this whole level is actually kind of

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.370 
and this whole level is actually kind of
creepy<00:03:12.770> because<00:03:13.430> these<00:03:13.640> gems<00:03:14.330> Genosha<00:03:15.110> ins

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
creepy because these gems Genosha ins

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.130 
creepy because these gems Genosha ins
they<00:03:15.620> like<00:03:15.800> pop<00:03:16.700> out<00:03:16.940> of<00:03:17.000> the<00:03:17.360> walls<00:03:17.630> and<00:03:17.959> then

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
they like pop out of the walls and then

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.660 
they like pop out of the walls and then
you<00:03:18.290> run<00:03:18.530> into<00:03:18.680> zombies<00:03:19.190> you<00:03:19.310> know<00:03:19.430> soon

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
you run into zombies you know soon

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.530 
you run into zombies you know soon
that's<00:03:19.940> kind<00:03:20.239> of<00:03:20.300> strange<00:03:21.160> but<00:03:22.330> once<00:03:23.330> you<00:03:23.450> get

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
that's kind of strange but once you get

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.630 
that's kind of strange but once you get
that<00:03:23.750> first<00:03:24.410> one<00:03:24.709> just<00:03:24.770> come<00:03:25.160> over<00:03:25.280> here<00:03:25.370> and

while staying on the brick wall the Jedi
Rises<00:03:36.920> it<00:03:37.100> that<00:03:37.670> way<00:03:37.820> you<00:03:37.880> don't<00:03:38.090> have<00:03:38.120> to

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
Rises it that way you don't have to

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.000 
Rises it that way you don't have to
build<00:03:38.540> it<00:03:38.690> and<00:03:38.959> it<00:03:39.200> just<00:03:39.350> makes<00:03:39.500> it<00:03:39.620> easier<00:03:39.890> to

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
build it and it just makes it easier to

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.770 
build it and it just makes it easier to
get<00:03:40.100> this<00:03:40.340> and<00:03:40.640> then<00:03:40.760> once<00:03:41.030> you<00:03:41.180> are<00:03:41.209> still<00:03:41.660> the

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
get this and then once you are still the

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
here and I almost fell off there you

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.350 
here and I almost fell off there you

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
need to knock that down which gives you

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.660 
need to knock that down which gives you
the<00:03:47.510> other<00:03:47.780> part<00:03:48.200> of<00:03:48.380> the<00:03:48.530> Janoskians<00:03:48.980> statue

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
the other part of the Janoskians statue

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.050 
the other part of the Janoskians statue
or<00:03:50.000> whatever<00:03:50.300> it<00:03:50.510> is<00:03:51.100> whatever<00:03:52.100> statue<00:03:52.700> this

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
or whatever it is whatever statue this

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.930 
or whatever it is whatever statue this
whatever<00:03:53.750> the<00:03:54.320> thing<00:03:54.680> on<00:03:55.040> the<00:03:55.220> door<00:03:55.489> is<00:03:55.730> that

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
whatever the thing on the door is that

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.990 
whatever the thing on the door is that
reminds<00:03:56.360> me<00:03:56.420> a<00:03:56.510> lot<00:03:57.080> of<00:03:57.140> Metroid<00:03:57.709> Prime<00:03:57.739> 3

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
reminds me a lot of Metroid Prime 3

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.280 
reminds me a lot of Metroid Prime 3
whole<00:03:59.000> level<00:03:59.180> it<00:03:59.390> kind<00:03:59.600> of<00:03:59.660> reminded<00:03:59.989> me<00:04:00.050> much

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
whole level it kind of reminded me much

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.670 
whole level it kind of reminded me much
of<00:04:00.320> that<00:04:00.860> Metroid<00:04:01.550> Prime<00:04:01.580> so<00:04:02.360> I<00:04:02.600> don't<00:04:03.590> know

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
of that Metroid Prime so I don't know

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.830 
of that Metroid Prime so I don't know
but<00:04:03.980> just<00:04:05.019> continue<00:04:06.019> on<00:04:06.200> once<00:04:06.500> it<00:04:06.620> opens<00:04:06.950> and<00:04:07.840> I

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
but just continue on once it opens and I

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.810 
but just continue on once it opens and I
guess<00:04:09.260> you<00:04:09.350> can<00:04:09.470> call<00:04:09.530> it<00:04:09.739> the<00:04:09.860> door<00:04:10.100> opener<00:04:10.610> if

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
guess you can call it the door opener if

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.990 
guess you can call it the door opener if
that<00:04:11.810> makes<00:04:12.049> you<00:04:12.170> happy<00:04:12.530> but<00:04:12.799> there<00:04:13.760> are<00:04:13.880> these

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
that makes you happy but there are these

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.670 
that makes you happy but there are these
random<00:04:14.329> spider<00:04:14.690> webs<00:04:14.930> on<00:04:15.109> the<00:04:15.200> walls<00:04:15.380> that<00:04:15.590> you

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
random spider webs on the walls that you

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.879 
random spider webs on the walls that you
can<00:04:15.799> pull<00:04:15.950> out<00:04:15.980> for<00:04:16.310> a<00:04:16.340> couple

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
can pull out for a couple

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.399 
can pull out for a couple
but<00:04:17.310> we<00:04:17.489> pretty<00:04:17.879> much<00:04:17.969> skip<00:04:18.359> all<00:04:18.810> of<00:04:18.989> them<00:04:19.139> and

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:19.409 
but we pretty much skip all of them and

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:21.709 
but we pretty much skip all of them and
it's<00:04:19.650> for<00:04:20.039> this<00:04:20.159> part<00:04:20.400> it's<00:04:20.609> better<00:04:21.209> just<00:04:21.569> to

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:21.719 
it's for this part it's better just to

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:24.619 
it's for this part it's better just to
be<00:04:21.959> the<00:04:22.169> commander<00:04:22.710> Cody<00:04:23.009> because<00:04:23.249> and<00:04:23.729> the

00:04:24.619 --> 00:04:24.629 
be the commander Cody because and the

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:26.749 
be the commander Cody because and the
other<00:04:24.810> storm<00:04:25.740> trooper<00:04:26.159> because<00:04:26.430> you<00:04:26.639> get

00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:26.759 
other storm trooper because you get

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:28.189 
other storm trooper because you get
these<00:04:26.939> lights<00:04:27.360> and<00:04:27.599> it<00:04:27.749> lets<00:04:27.930> you<00:04:28.050> actually

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 
these lights and it lets you actually

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:31.459 
these lights and it lets you actually
see<00:04:28.710> everything<00:04:29.159> and<00:04:29.900> there<00:04:30.900> really<00:04:31.229> isn't

00:04:31.459 --> 00:04:31.469 
see everything and there really isn't

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:33.980 
see everything and there really isn't
anything<00:04:31.830> you<00:04:32.039> can't<00:04:32.819> kill<00:04:33.120> without<00:04:33.300> shooting

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
anything you can't kill without shooting

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.749 
anything you can't kill without shooting
and<00:04:34.259> there's<00:04:34.499> a<00:04:34.560> really<00:04:34.770> than<00:04:34.979> anything<00:04:35.340> to

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:35.759 
and there's a really than anything to

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:39.739 
and there's a really than anything to
kill<00:04:36.060> anyway<00:04:37.819> so<00:04:38.819> I<00:04:38.849> just<00:04:39.029> need<00:04:39.210> to<00:04:39.330> continue

00:04:39.739 --> 00:04:39.749 
kill anyway so I just need to continue

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:42.800 
kill anyway so I just need to continue
on<00:04:39.900> through<00:04:40.379> and<00:04:40.740> at<00:04:41.009> the<00:04:41.159> end<00:04:41.340> I<00:04:41.669> think<00:04:41.810> it's

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
on through and at the end I think it's

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.200 
on through and at the end I think it's
at<00:04:43.110> the<00:04:43.289> end<00:04:43.469> of<00:04:43.620> this<00:04:43.740> there's<00:04:44.580> a<00:04:44.639> statue<00:04:44.999> you

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
at the end of this there's a statue you

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.189 
at the end of this there's a statue you
have<00:04:45.840> to<00:04:46.020> build<00:04:47.029> yeah<00:04:48.029> there's<00:04:48.840> a<00:04:48.930> statue

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 
have to build yeah there's a statue

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:50.990 
have to build yeah there's a statue
you've<00:04:49.439> got<00:04:49.620> to<00:04:49.740> build<00:04:49.919> and<00:04:50.310> if<00:04:50.550> for<00:04:50.969> some

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
you've got to build and if for some

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.909 
you've got to build and if for some
reason<00:04:51.569> you<00:04:51.659> can't<00:04:51.900> find<00:04:52.139> the<00:04:52.349> head<00:04:52.620> in<00:04:52.770> that

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
reason you can't find the head in that

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:54.890 
reason you can't find the head in that
statue<00:04:53.219> just<00:04:53.699> go<00:04:53.819> next<00:04:53.969> to<00:04:54.150> it<00:04:54.270> and<00:04:54.360> press<00:04:54.539> B

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
statue just go next to it and press B

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.839 
statue just go next to it and press B
and<00:04:55.139> its<00:04:55.289> head<00:04:55.650> will<00:04:55.770> show<00:04:56.039> up

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:56.849 
and its head will show up

00:04:56.849 --> 00:04:59.300 
and its head will show up
I<00:04:56.900> guess<00:04:57.900> the<00:04:58.050> head<00:04:58.199> hides<00:04:58.560> behind<00:04:58.800> the<00:04:59.039> statue

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
I guess the head hides behind the statue

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.629 
I guess the head hides behind the statue
they're<00:04:59.639> trying<00:04:59.939> to<00:04:59.969> build<00:05:00.150> but<00:05:00.539> anyway<00:05:00.960> just

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:01.639

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
get to that point

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.600 
get to that point
ignore<00:05:03.599> the<00:05:03.810> popping<00:05:04.469> out<00:05:04.590> Janoskians<00:05:05.250> I
