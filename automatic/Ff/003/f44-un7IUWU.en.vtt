if<00:01:05.850> I<00:01:06.030> were<00:01:06.060> in<00:01:06.330> his<00:01:06.540> position<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:08.869> so<00:01:11.570> it's

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
if I were in his position and so it's

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.630 
if I were in his position and so it's
going<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.140> be<00:01:13.200> interesting<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.799> guess<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:14.280> everly

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
going to be interesting I guess I everly
