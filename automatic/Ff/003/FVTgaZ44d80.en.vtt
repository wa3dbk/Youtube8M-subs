I<00:00:00.060> think<00:00:00.359> every<00:00:00.599> every<00:00:01.050> guy<00:00:01.170> shooting<00:00:01.439> I<00:00:01.500> was

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
I think every every guy shooting I was

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:02.780 
I think every every guy shooting I was
gonna<00:00:01.709> say<00:00:01.890> that<00:00:02.010> the<00:00:02.070> best<00:00:02.250> shooter<00:00:02.399> but<00:00:02.730> I

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
gonna say that the best shooter but I

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.249 
gonna say that the best shooter but I
