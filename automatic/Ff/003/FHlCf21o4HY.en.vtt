00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:07.549
 hello my name of alfredo angle cancer 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:11.450
 or industrial engineer 

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:13.820
 technological before 11 of sucre and the fp in 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.559
 Subject the electrical machine 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.140
 principle of division engines is 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:21.290
 based on the theory of law where 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.840
 says that every induction motor is not 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:26.630
 create a field inside and this one 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.790
 has a black position to develop 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.500
 a couple is opposition we are 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.500
 naming us forces against 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.360
 electromotive the principles of armadores 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.720
 of the engines is fundamental to the 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.840
 next way first we deny the 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.420
 engine 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.010
 is the instrument of the best we go 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.830
 to the characteristics of the maker with 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.260
 restoration to its position placed at a 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:52.500
 terminal point of the middle to one end of 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.200
 leg connection to make it and 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.239
 the power supply terminal 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.329
 It is placed on one end of the 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.589
 ends from the black 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:05.140
 there records the reading of 84 me 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.150
 ate 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.190
 that feels just like we are 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.050
 showing that the engine is that its 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.370
 Measurements are visible for the laying 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:17.250
 on going 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:17.250
 then with we are the engine to the network 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.250
 these two edges that I'm connecting the 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.520
 engine to the network have a difference of 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.440
 potential of 220 volts internal also 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.420
 there is the direct current but this 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.280
 motor is of alternating current and by 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.020
 so much we are going to analyze it with your 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.650
 respective current whose frequency its 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.650
 60 g 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.630
 to analyze the engine we have a 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.700
 contact that supplies us the current 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.460
 to the giant food doctors 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.830
 tell you and a switch that energizes 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:56.350
 the counter so that it gives us exit from 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.350
 power to the engine we proceed 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.380
 this button start the channel the next 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.790
 contest 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.980
 the speed 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.830
 that speed the and we finished with this 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.680
 what is this young girl called this tachometer 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.220
 shows the normal turn in the first 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.990
 straight are a thousand rpm and the next straight 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.110
 that will prove on point of 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.440
 reference of the indicated speed 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.440
 we proceed to measure 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.830
 I would suddenly go back 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:39.270
 this engine is speed 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.270
 if we do a speed calculation 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:51.030
 indicated by the so young but the 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.030
 observed in the part of this 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.510
 now we proceed to determine the source 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.580
 vacuum consumption of the engine through 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.490
 of the instrument that is called sight 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.440
 perimetric motion we place the cursor 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.660
 of the clamp in the perimeter at the point 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.460
 reference of the ampera we will place 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.320
 now in the power line of 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.470
 background either of them because both 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:18.510
 closes the circuit multiplying by its 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.510
 permanent massively amps 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:44.120
 again to be able 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.120
 sometimes 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.379
 as you watch the engine that was with a 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:52.379
 kind of inertia that church is normal 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:54.510
 at all time of driving machine and this 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:57.299
 it is for us to realize that there is 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:01.290
 a good slip there is no obstacle 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:03.180
 there is no bar or there is no sudden block 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.890
 that the motor can start one 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.590
 ease 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.129
 this 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:12.080
 Thank you for your attention and waiting for 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:14.349
 a next opportunity to light something 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.349
 best
