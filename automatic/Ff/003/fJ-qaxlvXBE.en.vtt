before<00:04:09.420> we<00:04:10.020> showed<00:04:10.260> the<00:04:10.440> final<00:04:10.770> results<00:04:11.220> let's

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:11.460 
before we showed the final results let's

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:12.590 
before we showed the final results let's
talk<00:04:11.610> about<00:04:11.850> some<00:04:12.270> of<00:04:12.330> the<00:04:12.390> unique

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
talk about some of the unique

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.789 
talk about some of the unique
characteristics<00:04:12.990> of<00:04:13.380> this<00:04:13.530> operation<00:04:15.799> right

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
characteristics of this operation right

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.740 
characteristics of this operation right
here<00:04:17.130> and<00:04:17.340> right<00:04:17.370> here<00:04:17.580> she<00:04:18.060> actually<00:04:18.209> had<00:04:18.480> two

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
here and right here she actually had two

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.660 
here and right here she actually had two
separate<00:04:19.410> bumps<00:04:19.860> which<00:04:20.190> is<00:04:20.310> a<00:04:20.340> little<00:04:20.519> bit

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:20.670 
separate bumps which is a little bit

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.180 
separate bumps which is a little bit
more<00:04:20.790> of<00:04:21.060> a<00:04:21.180> challenging<00:04:21.660> problem<00:04:21.959> to<00:04:22.830> correct

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
more of a challenging problem to correct

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.520 
more of a challenging problem to correct
the<00:04:23.520> other<00:04:23.670> thing<00:04:24.000> she<00:04:24.360> had<00:04:24.450> very<00:04:24.870> very<00:04:25.140> wide

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
the other thing she had very very wide

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.490 
the other thing she had very very wide
nasal<00:04:25.980> bones<00:04:26.190> I<00:04:26.400> put<00:04:26.940> an<00:04:27.030> X<00:04:27.240> here<00:04:27.510> and<00:04:28.110> an<00:04:28.230> X

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
nasal bones I put an X here and an X

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.310 
nasal bones I put an X here and an X
here<00:04:28.620> on<00:04:29.070> her<00:04:29.190> foot<00:04:29.400> on<00:04:29.960> Shelby<00:04:30.960> actually

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
here on her foot on Shelby actually

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.850 
here on her foot on Shelby actually
before<00:04:31.590> surgery<00:04:31.980> and<00:04:32.250> that's<00:04:32.910> the<00:04:33.860> lateral

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
before surgery and that's the lateral

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.650 
before surgery and that's the lateral
extent<00:04:35.160> or<00:04:35.490> in<00:04:35.730> other<00:04:35.850> words<00:04:35.910> where<00:04:36.300> the<00:04:36.420> bone

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
extent or in other words where the bone

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.650 
extent or in other words where the bone
stops<00:04:37.200> and<00:04:37.470> meet<00:04:37.620> with<00:04:37.650> the<00:04:37.830> cheek<00:04:38.130> bone<00:04:38.660> so

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
stops and meet with the cheek bone so

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.540 
stops and meet with the cheek bone so
unshelled<00:04:40.170> e<00:04:40.260> what<00:04:40.440> I<00:04:40.470> had<00:04:40.710> to<00:04:40.740> do<00:04:41.010> which<00:04:41.310> was<00:04:41.490> a

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
unshelled e what I had to do which was a

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.490 
unshelled e what I had to do which was a
little<00:04:41.850> bit<00:04:41.940> little<00:04:42.300> bit<00:04:42.360> unusual<00:04:42.540> is<00:04:43.140> what<00:04:43.410> we

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
little bit little bit unusual is what we

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.410 
little bit little bit unusual is what we
call<00:04:43.650> a<00:04:43.680> double<00:04:44.130> level<00:04:44.520> osteotomy<00:04:45.240> and

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 
call a double level osteotomy and

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.570 
call a double level osteotomy and
basically<00:04:46.050> what<00:04:46.200> that<00:04:46.260> means<00:04:46.350> is<00:04:46.740> breaking

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
basically what that means is breaking

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.310 
basically what that means is breaking
the<00:04:47.670> bones<00:04:47.820> in<00:04:48.120> two<00:04:48.330> separate<00:04:48.630> locations<00:04:49.080> and

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
the bones in two separate locations and

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.290 
the bones in two separate locations and
for<00:04:49.680> Shelby<00:04:50.040> the<00:04:50.370> other<00:04:50.550> important<00:04:51.090> thing

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
for Shelby the other important thing

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.700 
for Shelby the other important thing
which<00:04:51.570> she<00:04:51.990> didn't<00:04:52.140> really<00:04:52.230> complain<00:04:52.590> about

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
which she didn't really complain about

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.350 
which she didn't really complain about
cuz<00:04:52.950> she<00:04:53.070> didn't<00:04:53.280> get<00:04:53.400> teased<00:04:53.670> about<00:04:53.820> how<00:04:54.150> well

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
cuz she didn't get teased about how well

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.090 
cuz she didn't get teased about how well
she<00:04:54.540> breathed<00:04:54.810> but<00:04:55.290> her<00:04:55.560> breathing<00:04:55.920> really

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
she breathed but her breathing really

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.190 
she breathed but her breathing really
wasn't<00:04:56.520> very<00:04:56.670> good<00:04:56.790> she<00:04:57.540> not<00:04:57.750> only<00:04:57.780> had<00:04:58.170> a

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
wasn't very good she not only had a

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.440 
wasn't very good she not only had a
deviation<00:04:59.010> of<00:04:59.130> her<00:04:59.280> septum<00:04:59.790> but<00:05:00.030> she<00:05:00.210> had<00:05:00.330> what

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
deviation of her septum but she had what

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.360 
deviation of her septum but she had what
we<00:05:00.510> call<00:05:00.720> valve<00:05:01.590> collapse<00:05:02.010> where<00:05:02.250> the

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
we call valve collapse where the

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.970 
we call valve collapse where the
cartilages<00:05:02.910> are<00:05:03.390> sitting<00:05:04.200> too<00:05:04.410> close<00:05:04.440> to<00:05:04.860> the

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:04.980 
cartilages are sitting too close to the

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.290 
cartilages are sitting too close to the
septum<00:05:05.190> and<00:05:06.110> here<00:05:07.110> is<00:05:07.380> her<00:05:07.890> septum<00:05:08.400> not<00:05:09.150> her

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
septum and here is her septum not her

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.420 
septum and here is her septum not her
septum<00:05:09.720> but<00:05:09.900> a<00:05:10.140> skeleton<00:05:10.590> Septon<00:05:11.130> and<00:05:11.250> it's

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
septum but a skeleton Septon and it's

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.040 
septum but a skeleton Septon and it's
deviated<00:05:12.180> the<00:05:12.210> left<00:05:12.480> side<00:05:12.630> which<00:05:12.780> is<00:05:12.810> exactly

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
deviated the left side which is exactly

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.630 
deviated the left side which is exactly
how<00:05:13.410> Shelby's<00:05:13.800> was<00:05:13.950> deviated<00:05:14.220> hers<00:05:14.490> was

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640 
how Shelby's was deviated hers was

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.310 
how Shelby's was deviated hers was
deviated<00:05:14.970> over<00:05:15.330> to<00:05:15.450> the<00:05:15.510> left<00:05:15.690> and<00:05:15.900> the<00:05:16.050> mid

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
deviated over to the left and the mid

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.480 
deviated over to the left and the mid
portion<00:05:16.470> of<00:05:16.740> her<00:05:16.830> septum<00:05:17.130> was<00:05:17.220> all<00:05:17.370> the<00:05:17.460> way

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
portion of her septum was all the way

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:18.560 
portion of her septum was all the way
over<00:05:17.730> love<00:05:17.850> I<00:05:17.970> took<00:05:18.000> out<00:05:18.270> that<00:05:18.390> piece<00:05:18.540> of

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
over love I took out that piece of

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.690 
over love I took out that piece of
cartilage<00:05:18.930> that<00:05:19.530> was<00:05:19.680> the<00:05:19.860> deviated<00:05:20.280> portion

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
cartilage that was the deviated portion

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.720 
cartilage that was the deviated portion
of<00:05:20.790> the<00:05:20.910> septum<00:05:21.150> so<00:05:21.960> we<00:05:22.919> take<00:05:23.100> out<00:05:23.280> a<00:05:23.310> portion

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:23.730 
of the septum so we take out a portion

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.250 
of the septum so we take out a portion
of<00:05:23.790> that<00:05:23.910> but<00:05:24.120> real<00:05:24.480> important<00:05:24.900> to<00:05:25.080> leave

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:25.260 
of that but real important to leave

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.710 
of that but real important to leave
enough<00:05:25.620> structure<00:05:26.400> in<00:05:26.580> there<00:05:27.030> so<00:05:27.480> that<00:05:27.510> her

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 
enough structure in there so that her

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.420 
enough structure in there so that her
nose<00:05:27.870> doesn't<00:05:28.080> collapse<00:05:28.440> and<00:05:29.100> what's<00:05:29.250> so

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
nose doesn't collapse and what's so

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.370 
nose doesn't collapse and what's so
great<00:05:29.640> about<00:05:29.700> this<00:05:30.120> is<00:05:30.180> it's<00:05:30.600> not<00:05:30.840> only<00:05:31.020> an

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
great about this is it's not only an

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.340 
great about this is it's not only an
aesthetic<00:05:32.210> operation<00:05:33.210> but<00:05:33.510> a<00:05:33.540> functional<00:05:34.320> one

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.350 
aesthetic operation but a functional one
