00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:06.930
 and earth dear friends with you dan and 

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:09.179
 Today I wanted to show you the way that 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.629
 do all you lag gta 5 on bye 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:16.470
 how do you know the day before yesterday 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:21.990
 April 14 was the official release. 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:24.960
 gta 5 and there were many people who 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.960
 have so far any problems for example 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.449
 brakes for now but there are other problems too 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.280
 Of course, too, take off and a little bit late 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.490
 all the same I think someone I still help 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.560
 what did I want to show you today 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:42.660
 why what to do if you have gta 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.290
 5 that is, listen carefully not 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.200
 disable video do not waste 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:51.980
 I can not listen to the stripes 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:55.170
 nothing you can do what 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.510
 that is, for example, when you go to 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.820
 car speeds of 60 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.440
 kilometers an hour and you just begin here 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.300
 so texture move 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.730
 move there are many screenshots 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.160
 or for example on the helicopter also move 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.860
 move with his accelerate that is 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.590
 starts to slow down very much when you 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:19.200
 drive very fast or fly 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:22.310
 or run here for this you need to go 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.530
 in video card settings 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.310
 I for what you have there is a ppm or 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:34.890
 nvidia 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:38.310
 we are so in this case this is nvidia 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.140
 but also who those lucky nvidia qd you 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.440
 probably you will understand what you need 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.240
 make well think ways perfect 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.600
