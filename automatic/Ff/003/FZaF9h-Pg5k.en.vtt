00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
expo one in the x100s we have the new

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.150 
expo one in the x100s we have the new
x-trans<00:01:38.880> sensor<00:01:39.510> which<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:39.960> our<00:01:40.110> 16<00:01:40.500> megapixel

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
x-trans sensor which is our 16 megapixel

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.520 
x-trans sensor which is our 16 megapixel
with<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.460> phase<00:01:41.790> detection<00:01:42.270> pixels<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:43.410> it

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
with the phase detection pixels so it

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.730 
with the phase detection pixels so it
has<00:01:43.650> phase<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.250> contrast<00:01:44.910> detection<00:01:45.740> this
