00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:13.250
 in 2013 we will be able to have the 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.750
 opportunity to try all the next ones 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:20.350
 launches of 2014 for 2004 between 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.350
 many others 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.730
 to say 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.829
 friends of xbox live we continue in the 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.620
 showcase 2014 we are with santiago dj 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.960
 let's talk about fifa 14 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.430
 santiago welcome the reason thank you is 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.780
 and my fourth time taking only 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.110
 promoting fifa and it's always a 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.729
 pleasure let's talk about the last one has 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.559
 we are very excited with the announcement 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:59.629
 that legends is exclusively for 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.489
 xbox how to play 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.110
 yes, you will have the opportunity to 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.489
 play that way that today being 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.560
 no more popular game that we have of 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.270
 ecuador tv team which started as a 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.580
 small idea a few years ago and now 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.679
 has exploded to make the success that is today 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.570
 in day and what we did this year thank you 

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:18.140
 to the relationship we have with microsoft 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.149
 it's woman to do that you can find 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.490
 historical players in the packages that 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:25.159
 in the packs you find him 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.049
 of fox and which include your team and 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.509
 play like this in lines the players like 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.890
 oliver bierhoff and what about mateos and 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.430
 gianfranco zola who is my player 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:37.700
 favorite growing up fight then the 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:41.860
 truth gives a new guest not to what 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.860
 that is to play fifa and especially a team 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.819
 I imagine just like you can not anymore 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.920
 wait to take control how are you 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:56.840
 from alone the king pelÃ© great legends of the 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.609
 world football that is difficult against 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.229
 those back on the court and how do you think 

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:01.429
 that if they come with the figures as months 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.709
 Christians 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:05.119
 good is so it goes with the pse of that 

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:06.530
 Fantasy idea does not have to say 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.720
 please get you to find the best 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.069
 players that are in the world now they 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.280
 they found men who have been in it 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.920
 so for we are about to answer that 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.450
 question is the innovation is there now 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.879
 to see how the audience started talking to 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.739
 the players that passes and watch see how 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:24.900
 our fans playing with the players 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.239
 suddenly gianfranco zola there is a creator 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.099
 of number 10 who is deported 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.460
 beckenbauer also there then you have to 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.890
 see what 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.270
 with what equipment trees complicated that 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.660
 the cards that come out messi and 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.660
 beckenbauer 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.310
 luck since the fifa demo came out 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.260
 14 and 1 to play and although he has me very 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.820
 surprised the physics of the ball has been 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.130
 represented a great challenge as what 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:51.930
 they got 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:53.340
 good physics since fifa 2009 and it's 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.800
 something very difficult because obviously 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.060
 you have to model the value journey in 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.910
 Regarding the rotation that is applied 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.950
 after any kick or a head 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.750
 how to travel in the air 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.180
 comfort when when you touch the grass 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.650
 not then this year we said good and 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.840
 let's make an innovation as it is 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.750
 the pure shot around hitting the 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.180
 arch we can not complete if not 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.680
 we also modify the physics of 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.140
 ball to be equal to how it 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.780
 behaves for real life then 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.040
 we live experiments on how he behaves 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.470
 the ball in real life in the air 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.840
 after a challenge as are the 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.750
 curvature the trajectory based on 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.820
 rotating speed and so we have 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.790
 modeling what the ball is today 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.050
 in the amazing 14 so much talk about each other 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.980
 for already mere desire to play what you 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.980
 it seems we did with the match
