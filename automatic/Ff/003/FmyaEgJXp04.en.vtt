00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.700
 typical of pilates are up 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.629
 and abductions so it's about the 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.360
 spinal column 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:13.280
 That's why my program is now called 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:17.789
 Pilates moves and we start sitting 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:20.100
 your legs are put up the hands 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:24.720
 below the kneecaps and then 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.970
 start catching the tank and again 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.380
 up 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.609
 I concentrate on the first 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:38.129
 lower back so on the 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:42.270
 lumbar spine and then we come 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:47.370
 down to the thoracic spine and 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:52.410
 upward again pushes back and 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.050
 back up or back and up 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.530
 up 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:02.309
 a known term or known 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.619
 technique in pilates is the so-called c 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.680
 crank that means you try 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.260
 This up and down always moves 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.170
 to keep uniform c 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.229
 that is an entire spine 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.330
 a bow, and evenly so 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.180
 that the eddies swirl the individual 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.880
 still have room 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:29.900
 we're going downstairs now wanting us 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.900
 swirl down for vertebrae and then 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:38.369
 stretching his legs upwardly out let 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.170
 she slightly angled places the arms 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.380
 next to your body so that 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.500
 palms resting on the floor 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:49.740
 then start raising the tank and 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.619
 pay down again 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.479
 very important now is a pilates 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:58.460
 Powerhouse visitors really belly 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.460
 very hard to pull inwards 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.130
 and the whole thing should be possible without 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.759
 swing happen but from the belly 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.610
 out now we go backwards 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:16.170
 stay here now and come to the 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:20.190
 Exercise control balance now triggers that way 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:25.349
 Slow the right hand and bring it 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:30.090
 back left again and again 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:33.840
 back the right hand so if you can 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:41.209
 solve both hands and try here because 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:44.930
 balance then keep both hands 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:50.190
 to the left and try the right leg 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:58.519
 to stretch something up and again 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:58.519
 switch back page and release again 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:06.600
 Find a point on the ceiling and 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:09.139
 keep your balance thinking about a 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.139
 powerhouse 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:19.940
 and then solve again placed the poor 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.090
 live again the side that has the body 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.280
 me exhale invertebrates for invertebrates on 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.850
 the back bends to the legs 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:32.480
 up to sit pretty in the 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:35.630
 length aadmi and exhale 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.390
 again swirl down for vertebrae 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.910
 arms come down the legs 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:44.900
 down 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:51.070
 then both have me in and exhale 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:58.790
 legs up and again exhale deeply 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:04:01.630
 1 1 from online pays attention to the weight 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.970
 between the shoulder blades lothar 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:08.720
 keep your head straight and today completely 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.800
 important never move your head when you 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.269
 here the weight between the 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:17.060
 shoulder blades then have swirls for 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:20.750
 whirl up again and this time 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:23.960
 stretch your legs inhale make you 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:26.630
 long and with the next you exhale 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:31.930
 Do you have back to the left from the left 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:37.100
 legs to you and backwards stays here 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:39.919
 gave me a breathing in and out control balance 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:43.590
 this time the poor are down and 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:49.290
 back out again 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:58.620
 on and off think of the bow in yours 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:05:01.800
 spine target curve last time and 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:04.800
 then vortex agreement for invertebrates 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.310
 to sit up in the 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:12.210
 length 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:18.170
 up exhale me quite easily 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:22.230
 come back and stretch again 

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:26.300
 the shoulder back against the chin 

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:37.140
 but once down in the direction 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:44.450
 Breastbone back up and head 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:44.450
 right to left 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:54.130
 and that was already my pilates moves 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:58.590
 a small part of typical 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:58.590
 Pilates exercises until next time
