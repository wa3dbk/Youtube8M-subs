and the other so I don't have a wire
that's<00:01:44.970> long<00:01:45.750> enough<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:46.320> reach<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.649> different

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
that's long enough to reach a different

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
were installing turf so that's how I

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.620 
were installing turf so that's how I
knew<00:02:45.480> we<00:02:46.020> had<00:02:46.110> turf<00:02:46.380> on<00:02:46.620> that<00:02:46.770> field<00:02:46.980> and<00:02:47.630> yeah

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
I was still surprised that there was an

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.210 
I was still surprised that there was an
actual<00:02:50.070> school<00:02:50.490> and<00:02:51.650> and<00:02:52.650> there's<00:02:52.920> also

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
actual school and and there's also

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.740 
actual school and and there's also
something<00:02:53.490> else<00:02:53.670> so<00:02:53.820> surprised<00:02:54.240> about<00:02:54.510> when<00:02:54.690> I

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
something else so surprised about when I

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.770 
something else so surprised about when I
was<00:02:54.870> looking<00:02:55.140> at<00:02:55.230> that<00:02:55.260> those<00:02:55.770> uniforms<00:02:56.280> there

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
was looking at that those uniforms there

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
was looking at that those uniforms there
they're<00:02:57.780> actually<00:02:59.150> old<00:03:00.290> uniforms<00:03:01.290> or<00:03:01.500> just

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
they're actually old uniforms or just

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.650 
they're actually old uniforms or just
like<00:03:01.950> alternates<00:03:02.580> and<00:03:03.180> I<00:03:03.210> thought<00:03:03.450> they<00:03:03.600> were

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
like alternates and I thought they were

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.750 
like alternates and I thought they were
the<00:03:03.750> primary<00:03:04.110> one<00:03:04.440> so<00:03:04.830> didn't<00:03:05.460> turn<00:03:05.580> out<00:03:05.700> that

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
the primary one so didn't turn out that

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.390 
the primary one so didn't turn out that
well<00:03:06.000> right<00:03:06.900> here<00:03:06.960> for<00:03:07.410> the<00:03:07.560> alternate<00:03:08.100> helmet

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
well right here for the alternate helmet

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.730 
well right here for the alternate helmet
though<00:03:08.580> I<00:03:08.850> am<00:03:09.270> just<00:03:09.630> pretty<00:03:10.140> much<00:03:10.320> switched

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
though I am just pretty much switched

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.070 
though I am just pretty much switched
everything<00:03:10.980> I<00:03:11.550> just<00:03:12.240> put<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.600> colors

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
everything I just put the colors

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.390 
everything I just put the colors
backwards<00:03:13.860> and<00:03:14.280> put<00:03:14.580> the<00:03:14.760> alternate<00:03:15.270> logo<00:03:15.450> and

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
backwards and put the alternate logo and

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.270 
backwards and put the alternate logo and
yeah<00:03:17.400> for<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.880> young<00:03:18.060> and<00:03:19.020> then<00:03:19.530> you<00:03:20.040> see

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
yeah for the young and then you see

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.610 
yeah for the young and then you see
Arkansas<00:03:21.150> Tech<00:03:21.630> he<00:03:21.840> supposed<00:03:22.170> to<00:03:22.230> be<00:03:22.290> written

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620

Arkansas Tech he supposed to be written
on<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:22.830> chest<00:03:23.130> but<00:03:23.850> because<00:03:24.330> it<00:03:24.540> doesn't<00:03:24.840> fit

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
on the chest but because it doesn't fit

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.960 
on the chest but because it doesn't fit
I<00:03:25.380> could<00:03:25.739> just<00:03:25.890> put<00:03:26.100> text<00:03:26.550> so<00:03:26.670> that<00:03:26.700> was<00:03:26.940> like

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
I could just put text so that was like

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.310 
I could just put text so that was like
the<00:03:27.330> biggest<00:03:27.630> fall<00:03:28.170> in<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:29.190> young<00:03:29.570> team<00:03:30.570> like

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
getting it and also when I was doing the

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.340

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
roster took me double time because I was

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.140 
roster took me double time because I was
worried<00:04:10.890> that<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:11.370> power<00:04:11.640> is<00:04:11.790> going<00:04:12.000> to<00:04:12.060> go

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
worried that the power is going to go

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.850 
worried that the power is going to go
out<00:04:12.180> because<00:04:12.480> we<00:04:12.660> had<00:04:12.780> a<00:04:12.840> thunderstorm<00:04:13.410> wall<00:04:13.830> I

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
out because we had a thunderstorm wall I

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.640 
out because we had a thunderstorm wall I
was<00:04:14.370> doing<00:04:14.640> it<00:04:14.840> so<00:04:15.840> that<00:04:16.140> wasn't<00:04:16.380> that<00:04:16.440> helpful

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
was doing it so that wasn't that helpful

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.500 
was doing it so that wasn't that helpful
and<00:04:17.010> right<00:04:17.370> there<00:04:17.580> I<00:04:17.609> thought<00:04:17.880> that<00:04:18.030> uniform

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
and right there I thought that uniform

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.240 
and right there I thought that uniform
look<00:04:18.660> just<00:04:18.870> like<00:04:18.989> the<00:04:19.109> green<00:04:19.290> bay<00:04:19.440> packers<00:04:19.470> not

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
look just like the green bay packers not

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.279 
look just like the green bay packers not
with<00:04:20.489> this<00:04:20.669> new<00:04:20.910> strike<00:04:21.539> that<00:04:21.690> I<00:04:21.750> put<00:04:21.960> in<00:04:22.080> but

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
with this new strike that I put in but

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:25.400 
with this new strike that I put in but
like<00:04:23.160> what<00:04:23.700> when<00:04:24.000> i<00:04:24.300> switch<00:04:24.870> to<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:25.200> home

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
like what when i switch to the home

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.640 
like what when i switch to the home
alternate<00:04:26.010> it<00:04:26.190> looks

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
alternate it looks

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.100 
alternate it looks
he<00:04:26.740> was<00:04:26.860> agreement<00:04:27.340> that<00:04:27.520> years<00:04:27.759> I<00:04:27.910> swear<00:04:28.180> but

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
he was agreement that years I swear but

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.040 
he was agreement that years I swear but
yeah<00:04:29.350> so<00:04:29.740> I<00:04:30.009> flipped<00:04:30.400> back<00:04:30.729> here<00:04:31.180> and<00:04:31.360> I

through on the softball page but here's
when<00:05:43.479> i<00:05:43.570> noticed<00:05:43.780> i<00:05:43.990> was<00:05:44.110> on<00:05:44.199> the<00:05:44.229> football<00:05:44.440> so

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:44.949 
when i noticed i was on the football so

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:49.080 
when i noticed i was on the football so
that's<00:05:45.669> good<00:05:45.760> and<00:05:46.590> i<00:05:47.590> think<00:05:47.710> i<00:05:47.949> started<00:05:48.760> and

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090 
that's good and i think i started and

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.170 
that's good and i think i started and
then<00:05:49.810> I<00:05:50.139> noticed<00:05:50.409> it<00:05:50.740> was<00:05:50.770> on<00:05:50.949> jump<00:05:51.310> juggernaut

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.529 
then I noticed it was on jump juggernaut
which<00:05:52.419> means<00:05:52.690> every<00:05:53.260> single<00:05:53.650> rating<00:05:54.010> is<00:05:54.159> 99<00:05:54.699> so

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:55.539 
which means every single rating is 99 so

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:58.850 
which means every single rating is 99 so
I<00:05:55.599> switched<00:05:55.840> it<00:05:56.020> to<00:05:56.050> the<00:05:56.260> average<00:05:56.680> joes<00:05:57.159> and

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.370 
I switched it to the average joes and
yeah<00:05:59.860> so<00:06:00.280> I<00:06:00.610> stopped<00:06:01.240> that<00:06:01.479> there<00:06:01.780> and<00:06:01.990> I<00:06:02.080> flip
