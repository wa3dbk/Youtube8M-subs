00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
killstreaks oh that's good this class

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.939 
killstreaks oh that's good this class
that<00:00:55.469> I'm<00:00:55.559> using<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:56.039> kind<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:57.020> it's<00:00:58.020> one<00:00:58.770> of

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
that I'm using is kind of a it's one of

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.220 
that I'm using is kind of a it's one of
this<00:00:59.670> class<00:00:59.969> formula<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.480> I've<00:01:00.600> kind<00:01:01.170> of

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
this class formula that I've kind of

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.290 
this class formula that I've kind of
come<00:01:01.379> up<00:01:01.559> with<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:02.219> I<00:01:02.550> feel<00:01:02.969> it's<00:01:03.149> very

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
come up with that I feel it's very

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.440 
come up with that I feel it's very
useful<00:01:03.780> for<00:01:03.960> getting<00:01:04.880> decent<00:01:05.880> killstreaks

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
useful for getting decent killstreaks

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.590 
useful for getting decent killstreaks
with<00:01:06.770> because<00:01:07.770> it's<00:01:08.670> kind<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:08.939> my<00:01:09.090> ghosting

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
with because it's kind of my ghosting

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.590 
with because it's kind of my ghosting
class<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.560> means<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:11.330> won't<00:01:12.330> ever

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
class and that means that I won't ever

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.070 
class and that means that I won't ever
show<00:01:13.290> up<00:01:13.320> on<00:01:13.590> their<00:01:13.710> radar<00:01:14.600> except<00:01:15.600> for<00:01:15.780> my<00:01:15.900> g

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
show up on their radar except for my g

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.960 
show up on their radar except for my g
18<00:01:16.380> which<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.680> unsilenced<00:01:17.400> but<00:01:17.670> that's<00:01:17.820> only

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
18 which is unsilenced but that's only

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.640 
18 which is unsilenced but that's only
because<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.330> had<00:01:19.020> them<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.350> hadn't<00:01:19.770> unlocked<00:01:20.210> a

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
because I had them I hadn't unlocked a

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.850 
because I had them I hadn't unlocked a
silenced<00:01:22.850> the<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.150> silencer<00:01:24.570> for<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.900> so<00:01:25.170> yeah

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
silenced the the silencer for it so yeah

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.109 
silenced the the silencer for it so yeah
that's<00:01:26.159> why<00:01:26.390> but<00:01:27.530> for<00:01:28.530> my<00:01:28.680> form<00:01:29.040> i<00:01:29.100> uz<00:01:29.520> it's<00:01:29.970> all

on that one and right here that's kind

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.320 
on that one and right here that's kind
of<00:03:19.410> a<00:03:19.530> linear<00:03:19.710> area<00:03:20.280> i<00:03:20.340> usually<00:03:20.880> stay<00:03:21.120> away

strategy when i'm playing this game just

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.110 
strategy when i'm playing this game just
in<00:03:26.670> general<00:03:26.880> is<00:03:27.330> to<00:03:27.570> avoid<00:03:27.900> sight<00:03:28.320> lines<00:03:28.530> or

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
in general is to avoid sight lines or

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.270 
in general is to avoid sight lines or
minimize<00:03:30.120> sight<00:03:30.420> lines<00:03:30.660> for<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:31.650> enemy<00:03:32.070> and

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
minimize sight lines for the enemy and

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.910 
minimize sight lines for the enemy and
what<00:03:32.880> that<00:03:32.910> means<00:03:33.270> is<00:03:33.570> i<00:03:34.370> want<00:03:35.370> to<00:03:36.530> my<00:03:37.530> aim<00:03:37.740> is

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
what that means is i want to my aim is

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.460 
what that means is i want to my aim is
not<00:03:37.950> very<00:03:38.250> good<00:03:38.310> I<00:03:38.670> know<00:03:39.210> that<00:03:39.540> about<00:03:39.660> myself<00:03:39.810> I

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
not very good I know that about myself I

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.680 
not very good I know that about myself I

aim<00:04:14.430> is<00:04:14.610> not<00:04:14.640> up<00:04:14.940> to<00:04:15.090> snuff<00:04:15.150> at<00:04:15.540> those<00:04:16.020> ranges

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
aim is not up to snuff at those ranges

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.229 
aim is not up to snuff at those ranges
so<00:04:18.390> I'm<00:04:18.660> always<00:04:19.230> trying<00:04:19.830> to<00:04:20.160> kind<00:04:20.460> of<00:04:20.549> snake<00:04:20.940> my

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
so I'm always trying to kind of snake my

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.290 
so I'm always trying to kind of snake my
way<00:04:21.450> through<00:04:21.870> the<00:04:22.169> environments

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
way through the environments

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.170 
way through the environments
and<00:04:23.500> getting<00:04:24.500> it<00:04:24.620> gettin<00:04:25.069> engagements<00:04:25.699> such

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
and getting it gettin engagements such

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.450 
and getting it gettin engagements such
as<00:04:26.330> that<00:04:26.449> one<00:04:26.690> and<00:04:27.199> this<00:04:27.440> one<00:04:27.500> I<00:04:27.830> still<00:04:27.949> lose

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
as that one and this one I still lose

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.649 
as that one and this one I still lose
that<00:04:28.729> one<00:04:28.909> but<00:04:29.509> I<00:04:29.930> was<00:04:30.349> much<00:04:30.500> more<00:04:30.530> comfortable

00:04:31.649 --> 00:04:31.659 
that one but I was much more comfortable

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:35.080 
that one but I was much more comfortable
fighting<00:04:32.659> in<00:04:32.870> that<00:04:33.220> conflict<00:04:34.220> and<00:04:34.610> I<00:04:34.879> would

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
fighting in that conflict and I would

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.640 
fighting in that conflict and I would
have<00:04:35.180> been<00:04:35.509> if<00:04:35.810> that<00:04:36.199> sniper<00:04:36.500> had<00:04:36.860> been<00:04:38.650> 300

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
have been if that sniper had been 300

have been if that sniper had been 300
yards<00:04:39.889> away<00:04:39.979> you<00:04:40.129> know<00:04:40.430> it's<00:04:40.729> it's<00:04:41.360> it's<00:04:41.960> just

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
yards away you know it's it's it's just

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.800 
yards away you know it's it's it's just
a<00:04:42.229> matter<00:04:42.409> of<00:04:42.560> getting<00:04:42.979> into<00:04:43.669> situations<00:04:44.090> in

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
a matter of getting into situations in

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.070 
a matter of getting into situations in
which<00:04:44.870> you're<00:04:45.860> more<00:04:46.039> comfortable<00:04:46.370> and<00:04:47.080> in

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
which you're more likely to be

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.050 
which you're more likely to be
successful<00:04:51.099> when<00:04:52.099> it<00:04:52.220> comes<00:04:52.460> to<00:04:52.669> killing<00:04:52.970> the

successful when it comes to killing the
enemy<00:04:53.360> and<00:04:54.250> of<00:04:55.250> course<00:04:55.490> that's<00:04:55.610> that's<00:04:55.969> an

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
enemy and of course that's that's an

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.640 
enemy and of course that's that's an
important<00:04:56.479> component<00:04:56.659> you<00:04:57.080> have<00:04:57.229> to<00:04:57.379> you<00:04:57.620> have

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.409 
which I feel like is pretty good each
one<00:06:00.259> takes<00:06:00.469> me<00:06:00.620> about<00:06:00.710> eight<00:06:01.610> hours<00:06:01.969> to

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:30.770 
long I still feel like I'm going at a
pretty<00:06:28.319> good<00:06:28.560> pace<00:06:28.849> but<00:06:29.849> every<00:06:30.449> once<00:06:30.599> in<00:06:30.750> a

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:30.780 
pretty good pace but every once in a

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:31.879 
pretty good pace but every once in a
while<00:06:30.900> I'm<00:06:31.080> just<00:06:31.289> going<00:06:31.409> to<00:06:31.439> need<00:06:31.590> to<00:06:31.710> take<00:06:31.860> a

00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:34.949 
break because it's hard to come up with

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:37.279 
break because it's hard to come up with

taking a while it's because I have a lot

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:57.860
