successful<00:00:32.610> now<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.120> have<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.450> start<00:00:33.690> with<00:00:33.840> a

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
successful now you have to start with a

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.380 
successful now you have to start with a
container<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.680> believe<00:00:35.489> me<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.850> size<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.300> the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390

container and believe me the size of the
container<00:00:36.690> really<00:00:37.170> matters<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.980> larger<00:00:38.850> the

container I think the better don't want
something<00:00:41.489> too<00:00:41.609> small<00:00:41.879> because<00:00:42.059> you're<00:00:42.300> not

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
something too small because you're not

something too small because you're not
gonna<00:00:42.510> have<00:00:42.750> enough<00:00:42.780> soil<00:00:43.320> volume<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:44.280> really

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:44.519 
gonna have enough soil volume to really

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:47.060

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
is an indicator also that the soil is

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.110 
is an indicator also that the soil is
going<00:01:49.410> to<00:01:49.530> drain<00:01:49.770> well<00:01:50.040> okay

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
going to drain well okay

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.520 
going to drain well okay
the<00:01:51.450> next<00:01:51.750> thing<00:01:51.870> you<00:01:51.960> need<00:01:52.080> to<00:01:52.200> think<00:01:52.410> about

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
the next thing you need to think about

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.760 
the next thing you need to think about
is<00:01:52.950> fertilized<00:01:53.730> nutrition<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:55.020> need<00:01:55.080> to<00:01:55.590> make

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
is fertilized nutrition you need to make

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.250 
is fertilized nutrition you need to make
sure<00:01:56.010> that<00:01:56.220> your<00:01:56.370> plants<00:01:56.760> are<00:01:56.910> well<00:01:57.120> fed<00:01:57.360> so<00:01:57.990> I

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
sure that your plants are well fed so I

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.900 
sure that your plants are well fed so I
start<00:01:58.680> out<00:01:58.770> with<00:01:58.830> a<00:01:58.950> granular<00:01:59.430> fertilizer

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
start out with a granular fertilizer

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.440 
start out with a granular fertilizer
that<00:02:00.210> are<00:02:00.300> working<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.660> soil<00:02:00.900> like<00:02:01.500> this<00:02:02.450> you

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
that are working the soil like this you

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.360 
that are working the soil like this you
can<00:02:03.600> use<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.810> slow-release<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.980> can<00:02:05.130> feed

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
can use a slow-release that can feed

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.280 
can use a slow-release that can feed
them<00:02:05.550> over<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.880> season<00:02:06.330> once<00:02:06.870> you<00:02:06.990> get<00:02:07.140> them

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
them over the season once you get them

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.320 
them over the season once you get them
planted<00:02:07.500> then<00:02:08.160> you<00:02:08.280> can<00:02:08.459> begin<00:02:08.729> feeding<00:02:09.000> them

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
planted then you can begin feeding them

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.330 
planted then you can begin feeding them
regularly<00:02:09.780> with<00:02:10.019> a<00:02:10.050> water<00:02:10.410> soluble<00:02:11.099> plant

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
regularly with a water soluble plant

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.210 
regularly with a water soluble plant
food

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
food

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.770 
food
and<00:02:12.310> that'll<00:02:12.610> really<00:02:12.790> increase<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.540> flower

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
and that'll really increase the flower

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.710 
and that'll really increase the flower
power<00:02:14.500> next<00:02:15.220> comes<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:15.790> plants<00:02:16.330> this<00:02:16.660> is

power next comes the plants this is

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.600 
power next comes the plants this is
where<00:02:16.960> it<00:02:17.050> gets<00:02:17.200> really<00:02:17.500> exciting<00:02:17.650> because

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
blast so what I'm gonna do here is I'm

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.700 
blast so what I'm gonna do here is I'm
creating<00:02:30.190> a<00:02:30.490> singular<00:02:31.330> sensation<00:02:31.710> meaning

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
creating a singular sensation meaning

creating a singular sensation meaning
that<00:02:32.860> I'm<00:02:33.010> putting<00:02:33.340> all<00:02:33.610> one<00:02:34.150> variety<00:02:34.660> in<00:02:34.780> one

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
that I'm putting all one variety in one

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.690 
that I'm putting all one variety in one
container<00:02:35.350> and<00:02:35.590> like<00:02:35.980> I<00:02:36.070> did<00:02:36.220> up<00:02:36.250> here<00:02:36.520> by<00:02:36.640> the

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
container and like I did up here by the

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.610 
container and like I did up here by the
front<00:02:36.910> door<00:02:37.150> if<00:02:37.900> you<00:02:38.020> want<00:02:38.170> to<00:02:38.230> get<00:02:38.320> really

front door if you want to get really

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.650 
front door if you want to get really
creative<00:02:38.920> one<00:02:39.250> of<00:02:39.340> my<00:02:39.430> rules<00:02:39.640> of<00:02:39.850> thumb<00:02:40.120> is<00:02:40.390> to

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
creative one of my rules of thumb is to

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.480 
creative one of my rules of thumb is to
mix<00:02:41.200> it<00:02:41.350> up<00:02:41.440> just<00:02:41.680> a<00:02:41.800> little<00:02:41.830> bit<00:02:42.040> and<00:02:42.340> use

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
mix it up just a little bit and use

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.699 
mix it up just a little bit and use
three<00:02:42.760> different<00:02:42.880> types<00:02:43.300> of<00:02:43.750> plants<00:02:44.200> for

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
three different types of plants for

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.530 
three different types of plants for
instance<00:02:45.070> you'd<00:02:45.670> use<00:02:45.880> something<00:02:46.240> tall<00:02:46.510> and

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
instance you'd use something tall and

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.290 
instance you'd use something tall and
spiky<00:02:47.290> in<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:47.830> back<00:02:48.040> or<00:02:48.310> in<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.400> middle<00:02:48.790> call

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
spiky in the back or in the middle call

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.150 
spiky in the back or in the middle call
that<00:02:49.570> a<00:02:49.780> thriller<00:02:50.140> then<00:02:50.560> around<00:02:50.770> the<00:02:50.920> base<00:02:51.130> of

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
that a thriller then around the base of

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.130 
that a thriller then around the base of
it<00:02:51.550> add<00:02:51.700> something<00:02:52.209> little<00:02:52.360> toys<00:02:52.630> fill<00:02:52.930> in

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
it add something little toys fill in

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.560 
it add something little toys fill in
that's<00:02:53.650> a<00:02:53.830> filler<00:02:54.130> then<00:02:54.610> for<00:02:54.820> cascading<00:02:55.209> over

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
that's a filler then for cascading over

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.480 
that's a filler then for cascading over
the<00:02:55.630> edge<00:02:55.840> choose<00:02:56.620> something<00:02:56.890> that<00:02:57.160> would<00:02:57.310> be

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
the edge choose something that would be

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.430 
the edge choose something that would be
a<00:02:57.670> Spiller<00:02:58.030> so<00:02:58.600> you<00:02:58.660> get<00:02:58.930> it<00:02:59.080> you've<00:02:59.230> got<00:02:59.410> a

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
a Spiller so you get it you've got a

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.350 
a Spiller so you get it you've got a
perilla<00:02:59.860> a<00:03:00.100> pillar<00:03:00.520> and<00:03:00.760> a<00:03:00.940> Spiller

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
perilla a pillar and a Spiller

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.770 
perilla a pillar and a Spiller
okay<00:03:02.260> now<00:03:02.620> let's<00:03:03.010> talk<00:03:03.130> about<00:03:03.190> water<00:03:03.670> water<00:03:04.510> is

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
okay now let's talk about water water is

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.990 
okay now let's talk about water water is
very<00:03:05.200> important<00:03:05.860> they<00:03:06.370> just<00:03:06.670> want<00:03:06.850> to<00:03:06.880> make

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
very important they just want to make

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.180 
very important they just want to make

the<00:03:13.690> foliage<00:03:14.230> and<00:03:14.470> the<00:03:14.590> blooms<00:03:14.860> you<00:03:15.490> see<00:03:15.670> when

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
the foliage and the blooms you see when

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.120 
the foliage and the blooms you see when
you<00:03:15.940> do<00:03:16.090> that<00:03:16.360> you<00:03:16.840> create<00:03:17.050> an<00:03:17.290> environment<00:03:17.650> in

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
you do that you create an environment in

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.490 
you do that you create an environment in
among<00:03:18.489> the<00:03:18.640> leaves<00:03:18.820> and<00:03:19.180> so<00:03:19.360> forth<00:03:19.720> -<00:03:20.230> that

just creates a breeding ground for

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.759 
just creates a breeding ground for
disease<00:03:21.880> which<00:03:22.510> is<00:03:22.660> no<00:03:22.840> good<00:03:23.050> for<00:03:23.200> your<00:03:23.320> plants

consistently moist yeah when to water
this<00:03:34.900> may<00:03:35.080> seem<00:03:35.140> like<00:03:35.410> a<00:03:35.560> really<00:03:35.860> basic

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
this may seem like a really basic

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.090 
this may seem like a really basic
question<00:03:36.760> but<00:03:37.269> it's<00:03:37.720> really<00:03:37.959> not<00:03:38.260> the<00:03:38.980> best

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
question but it's really not the best

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.770 
question but it's really not the best
way<00:03:39.310> to<00:03:39.340> test<00:03:39.670> just<00:03:39.970> to<00:03:40.090> go<00:03:40.269> and<00:03:40.420> stick<00:03:40.630> your

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
way to test just to go and stick your

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.259 
way to test just to go and stick your
finger<00:03:41.080> in<00:03:41.200> the<00:03:41.290> soil<00:03:41.560> if<00:03:42.070> it<00:03:42.220> feels<00:03:42.430> dry<00:03:42.880> then

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
finger in the soil if it feels dry then

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.990 
finger in the soil if it feels dry then
the<00:03:43.360> plants<00:03:43.780> need<00:03:43.989> some<00:03:44.470> water<00:03:44.709> you<00:03:45.459> may<00:03:45.640> think

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
the plants need some water you may think

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.210 
the plants need some water you may think
well<00:03:46.209> if<00:03:46.630> this<00:03:46.870> container<00:03:47.290> needs<00:03:47.560> water<00:03:47.890> then

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
well if this container needs water then

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.000 
well if this container needs water then
they<00:03:48.340> all<00:03:48.519> do<00:03:48.790> not<00:03:49.269> necessarily<00:03:49.989> true<00:03:50.260> if<00:03:50.860> you

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
they all do not necessarily true if you

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.470 
they all do not necessarily true if you
have<00:03:51.100> smaller<00:03:51.489> containers<00:03:52.150> they're<00:03:52.299> going<00:03:52.420> to

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
have smaller containers they're going to

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.539 
have smaller containers they're going to
dry<00:03:52.750> out<00:03:52.870> more<00:03:53.019> quickly<00:03:53.260> so<00:03:53.980> the<00:03:54.130> next<00:03:54.310> time
