tactics<00:00:29.990> you<00:00:30.990> want<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.230> change<00:00:31.500> these<00:00:31.740> to

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
tactics you want to change these to

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.250

however<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:32.520> want<00:00:32.579> them<00:00:32.880> so<00:00:33.180> I'll<00:00:33.690> do<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.079> quick

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
however you want them so I'll do a quick

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.160 
however you want them so I'll do a quick
example<00:00:34.890> we'll<00:00:35.760> do<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:35.940> possession<00:00:36.570> based<00:00:36.899> one

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
example we'll do a possession based one

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.950 
example we'll do a possession based one
so<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:38.070> know<00:00:38.190> want<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.579> nice<00:00:39.030> balance<00:00:39.450> build<00:00:39.750> up

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
so you know want a nice balance build up

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.959 
so you know want a nice balance build up
and<00:00:40.140> I'm<00:00:41.129> gonna<00:00:41.309> do<00:00:41.460> short<00:00:41.790> passing<00:00:42.680> probably

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
and I'm gonna do short passing probably

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:51.229 
and I'm gonna do short passing probably
25<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.719> then<00:00:47.329> maybe<00:00:48.590> normal<00:00:49.760> chance<00:00:50.760> creation

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
25 and then maybe normal chance creation

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.760 
25 and then maybe normal chance creation
passing<00:00:51.660> oh<00:00:51.780> yeah<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.199> gotta<00:00:52.379> have<00:00:52.559> that<00:00:52.590> on

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
passing oh yeah you gotta have that on

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.660 
passing oh yeah you gotta have that on
freeform<00:00:53.039> for<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.640> possession<00:00:54.570> one<00:00:54.870> because<00:00:55.670> it

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
freeform for a possession one because it

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.580 
freeform for a possession one because it
just<00:00:56.730> means<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.239> players<00:00:57.449> run<00:00:57.809> round<00:00:57.989> more

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
just means the players run round more

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.150 
just means the players run round more
make<00:00:58.920> morons<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.550> get<00:01:00.449> closer<00:01:00.690> together

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
make morons and get closer together

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.920 
make morons and get closer together
without<00:01:02.160> really<00:01:02.820> minding<00:01:03.329> where<00:01:03.539> they<00:01:03.690> are<00:01:03.809> on

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
without really minding where they are on

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.960 
without really minding where they are on
the<00:01:03.989> pitch<00:01:04.199> which<00:01:04.530> can<00:01:05.220> be<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.400> problem<00:01:05.610> for

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
the pitch which can be a problem for

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.340 
the pitch which can be a problem for
countless<00:01:06.390> but<00:01:06.750> when<00:01:06.960> you're<00:01:07.049> in<00:01:07.140> possession

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
countless but when you're in possession

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.850 
countless but when you're in possession
it's<00:01:07.619> really<00:01:07.979> really<00:01:08.130> good<00:01:08.280> for<00:01:08.369> attacking

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
it's really really good for attacking

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.160 
it's really really good for attacking
then<00:01:10.860> we<00:01:11.549> have<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:12.240> course<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.900> chance

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
then we have of course the chance

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.020 
then we have of course the chance
creation<00:01:13.619> so<00:01:14.210> I<00:01:15.470> like<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.500> have<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:17.250> little<00:01:17.820> bit

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
creation so I like to have a little bit

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.270 
creation so I like to have a little bit
lower<00:01:18.299> cross<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:18.900> some<00:01:19.799> people<00:01:20.040> will<00:01:20.159> probably

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
lower cross in some people will probably

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.800 
lower cross in some people will probably
want<00:01:20.549> blows<00:01:20.820> across<00:01:21.090> them<00:01:21.330> because<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.659> can

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
want blows across them because you can

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.929 
want blows across them because you can
just<00:01:22.259> scroll<00:01:22.500> those<00:01:22.680> ahead<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.009> on<00:01:23.130> this<00:01:23.310> FIFA

gonna<00:02:07.950> have<00:02:08.129> high<00:02:08.399> pressure<00:02:09.080> so

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
gonna have high pressure so

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.130 
gonna have high pressure so
probably<00:02:11.890> around<00:02:12.370> 75<00:02:12.910> and<00:02:13.270> high<00:02:13.660> aggression

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
probably around 75 and high aggression

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.020 
probably around 75 and high aggression
as<00:02:14.320> well<00:02:14.590> I<00:02:16.710> see<00:02:17.710> you<00:02:17.770> plays<00:02:17.980> we'll<00:02:18.160> just<00:02:18.370> hump

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
as well I see you plays we'll just hump

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.280 
as well I see you plays we'll just hump
the<00:02:19.180> ball<00:02:19.360> down<00:02:19.570> especially<00:02:19.930> with<00:02:20.200> that

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
the ball down especially with that

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.360 
the ball down especially with that
pressure<00:02:20.560> you've<00:02:20.830> got<00:02:20.950> a<00:02:20.980> nice<00:02:21.100> high

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
pressure you've got a nice high

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.120 
pressure you've got a nice high
defending<00:02:22.030> line<00:02:22.300> and<00:02:22.630> it<00:02:23.440> can<00:02:23.620> be<00:02:23.740> a<00:02:23.770> bit<00:02:23.950> of<00:02:24.040> a

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
defending line and it can be a bit of a

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.460 
defending line and it can be a bit of a
problem<00:02:24.310> again<00:02:24.760> when<00:02:25.090> you<00:02:25.600> get<00:02:25.780> encountered

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
problem again when you get encountered

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.400 
problem again when you get encountered
but<00:02:27.070> if<00:02:27.340> you<00:02:27.490> go<00:02:27.640> with<00:02:27.820> the<00:02:27.940> ball<00:02:28.150> then<00:02:28.630> that

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
but if you go with the ball then that

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.700 
but if you go with the ball then that
situation<00:02:30.130> won't<00:02:30.280> arise<00:02:30.670> too<00:02:31.030> much<00:02:31.300> and<00:02:31.710> I'm

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
situation won't arise too much and I'm

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.610 
situation won't arise too much and I'm

moving<00:02:43.660> on<00:02:43.780> and<00:02:44.459> team<00:02:45.700> width<00:02:46.030> we<00:02:46.600> are<00:02:46.780> gonna

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
moving on and team width we are gonna

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.180 
moving on and team width we are gonna
have<00:02:48.390> balanced<00:02:49.390> oh<00:02:49.770> it's<00:02:50.770> actually<00:02:50.890> normal

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
have balanced oh it's actually normal

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.790 
have balanced oh it's actually normal
but<00:02:51.790> yep<00:02:52.270> you<00:02:52.870> don't<00:02:53.050> want<00:02:53.230> your<00:02:53.410> wing<00:02:53.590> backs

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
but yep you don't want your wing backs

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.310 
but yep you don't want your wing backs
too<00:02:54.100> far<00:02:54.370> out<00:02:54.610> because<00:02:55.000> it<00:02:55.690> will<00:02:55.780> create<00:02:55.989> gaps

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
too far out because it will create gaps

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.930 
too far out because it will create gaps
between<00:02:56.590> your<00:02:56.890> center<00:02:57.100> backs<00:02:57.280> and<00:02:57.520> your<00:02:57.730> wing

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
between your center backs and your wing

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.400 
between your center backs and your wing
bucks<00:02:58.239> and<00:02:58.570> the<00:02:58.750> ball<00:02:58.930> can<00:02:59.080> be<00:02:59.110> placed<00:02:59.350> through

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
bucks and the ball can be placed through

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.500 
bucks and the ball can be placed through
easily<00:02:59.970> but<00:03:00.970> you<00:03:01.030> don't<00:03:01.180> want<00:03:01.300> them<00:03:01.390> too

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
easily but you don't want them too

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.360 
easily but you don't want them too
narrow<00:03:01.750> either<00:03:02.020> or<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.320> wingers<00:03:02.920> are<00:03:03.100> going

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
narrow either or the wingers are going

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.610 
narrow either or the wingers are going
to<00:03:03.459> get<00:03:03.610> down<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:03.850> wings<00:03:04.000> a<00:03:04.180> lot<00:03:04.420> and<00:03:04.690> you<00:03:05.500> will

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
to get down the wings a lot and you will

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.410 
to get down the wings a lot and you will
probably<00:03:05.980> concede<00:03:06.580> a<00:03:06.610> lot<00:03:06.820> of<00:03:06.910> headed<00:03:07.150> goals

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
probably concede a lot of headed goals

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.870 
probably concede a lot of headed goals
and<00:03:08.040> consider<00:03:09.040> when<00:03:09.160> we<00:03:09.250> do<00:03:09.400> that<00:03:09.550> anyway

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
and consider when we do that anyway

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.550 
and consider when we do that anyway
that's<00:03:10.750> not<00:03:11.080> good

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
that's not good

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.050 
that's not good
so<00:03:12.190> defend<00:03:12.790> the<00:03:12.940> line<00:03:13.209> you<00:03:13.510> want<00:03:13.600> cover

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
so defend the line you want cover

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.460 
so defend the line you want cover
because<00:03:16.060> then<00:03:16.209> when<00:03:16.450> one<00:03:16.780> player<00:03:16.989> goes<00:03:17.230> in<00:03:17.410> to

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
because then when one player goes in to

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.020 
because then when one player goes in to
try<00:03:17.620> and<00:03:17.709> win<00:03:17.830> the<00:03:17.950> ball<00:03:18.190> then<00:03:18.489> you've<00:03:18.670> got<00:03:18.880> a

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
try and win the ball then you've got a

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.430 
try and win the ball then you've got a
another<00:03:20.190> behind<00:03:21.190> him<00:03:21.580> and<00:03:22.200> stopping<00:03:23.200> them

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
another behind him and stopping them

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.850 
another behind him and stopping them
running<00:03:23.680> into<00:03:23.860> too<00:03:24.130> much<00:03:24.250> space<00:03:24.660> so<00:03:25.860> once

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
running into too much space so once

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.650 
running into too much space so once
you've<00:03:27.070> once<00:03:27.459> you<00:03:27.549> happy<00:03:27.850> with<00:03:28.120> your<00:03:28.239> custom

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660
