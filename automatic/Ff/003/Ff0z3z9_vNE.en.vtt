00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
family we do see that okay that's that

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.360 
family we do see that okay that's that
looking<00:00:43.290> out<00:00:43.410> in<00:00:43.559> front<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.920> orbiter<00:00:46.370> okay

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
looking out in front of the orbiter okay

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.820 
looking out in front of the orbiter okay
we're<00:00:47.520> seeing<00:00:47.670> three<00:00:47.790> or<00:00:48.030> four<00:00:48.300> objects<00:00:48.830> can

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:49.830 
we're seeing three or four objects can

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.080 
we're seeing three or four objects can
you<00:00:49.920> confirm<00:00:50.040> that<00:00:50.430> it's<00:00:50.580> just<00:00:50.790> the<00:00:50.910> one

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
you confirm that it's just the one

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.490 
you confirm that it's just the one
that's<00:00:51.390> actually<00:00:51.720> moving<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.200> other<00:00:52.320> ones

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
that's actually moving the other ones

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
that's actually moving the other ones
are<00:00:52.620> just<00:00:52.650> reflecting<00:00:53.250> reflections<00:00:55.520> now

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
are just reflecting reflections now

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.190 
are just reflecting reflections now
there<00:00:56.760> are<00:00:56.790> there<00:00:57.300> are<00:00:57.420> three<00:00:57.630> objects<00:00:58.079> the

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 
there are there are three objects the

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.080 
there are there are three objects the
one<00:00:58.380> you<00:00:58.530> see<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:59.040> see<00:00:59.190> two<00:00:59.430> rings<00:00:59.760> right

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
one you see you see two rings right

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.430 
one you see you see two rings right
there<00:01:00.360> they're<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.660> ones<00:01:00.840> we<00:01:01.050> kind<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.290> had

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
there they're the ones we kind of had

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.430 
there they're the ones we kind of had
the<00:01:01.560> late<00:01:01.739> Tallyho<00:01:02.280> on<00:01:02.480> the<00:01:03.480> one<00:01:03.690> down<00:01:04.259> on<00:01:04.350> the

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
the late Tallyho on the one down on the

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.380 
the late Tallyho on the one down on the
bottom<00:01:04.619> that<00:01:04.830> was<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.190> one<00:01:05.309> we<00:01:05.430> initially<00:01:06.119> saw

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
bottom that was the one we initially saw

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.719 
bottom that was the one we initially saw
that<00:01:06.750> appeared<00:01:07.410> to<00:01:07.470> be<00:01:07.530> foil<00:01:08.009> so<00:01:08.399> we've<00:01:08.550> got

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
that appeared to be foil so we've got

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.190 
that appeared to be foil so we've got
like<00:01:08.880> two<00:01:09.119> rings<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.690> then<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.840> piece<00:01:10.050> of

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
like two rings and then the piece of

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.370 
like two rings and then the piece of
foil<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.740> piece<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:11.040> foil<00:01:12.080> seems<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.229> be

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
foil the piece of foil seems to be

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.080 
foil the piece of foil seems to be
further<00:01:13.800> in<00:01:14.100> front<00:01:14.430> with<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.790> with<00:01:15.060> the

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
further in front with the with the

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.310 
further in front with the with the
grounding<00:01:15.509> strap<00:01:15.630> on<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:15.990> seems<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.259> be

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
grounding strap on it seems to be

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.870 
grounding strap on it seems to be
further<00:01:16.590> in<00:01:16.800> front<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.220> other<00:01:17.369> two<00:01:17.640> and

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
further in front of the other two and

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.490 
further in front of the other two and
the<00:01:17.940> other<00:01:18.060> two<00:01:18.330> seem<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.690> be<00:01:18.840> about<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.290> same

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
the other two seem to be about the same

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.920 
the other two seem to be about the same
my<00:01:19.770> equal<00:01:20.130> distance<00:01:20.460> from<00:01:20.520> both<00:01:21.210> us<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.780> the

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
my equal distance from both us and the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:43.270 
my equal distance from both us and the
forward<00:01:24.020> copy<00:01:25.020> that

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.430

the crew actually commanding this
payload<00:01:45.799> Bay<00:01:45.920> camera<00:01:46.280> to<00:01:46.460> look<00:01:46.640> at<00:01:46.820> the

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
payload Bay camera to look at the

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.200 
payload Bay camera to look at the
objects<00:01:47.840> observed<00:01:48.229> out<00:01:48.890> the<00:01:49.700> flight<00:01:50.060> deck

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
objects observed out the flight deck

00:01:50.210 --> 00:02:25.890 
objects observed out the flight deck
windows

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.080 

excuse<00:02:26.650> that<00:02:26.860> lattice<00:02:27.129> good<00:02:29.819> yeah<00:02:30.819> I'm<00:02:30.970> just

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
excuse that lattice good yeah I'm just

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.240 
excuse that lattice good yeah I'm just
wondering<00:02:31.560> how<00:02:32.560> close<00:02:32.769> we<00:02:32.950> are<00:02:32.980> to<00:02:33.099> the

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
wondering how close we are to the

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:42.000 
wondering how close we are to the
trajectory<00:02:33.819> phone<00:02:34.030> by<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.209> toys<00:02:40.799> and<00:02:41.799> we're

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
trajectory phone by the toys and we're

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:49.290 
trajectory phone by the toys and we're
asking

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.960 

we're<00:02:49.840> going<00:02:49.990> to<00:02:50.050> check<00:02:50.170> on<00:02:50.380> that<00:02:50.820> but<00:02:51.820> while

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
we're going to check on that but while

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.430 
we're going to check on that but while
we're<00:02:52.090> waiting<00:02:52.330> for<00:02:52.360> that<00:02:52.570> we're<00:02:53.230> thinking

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
we're waiting for that we're thinking

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.770 
we're waiting for that we're thinking
based<00:02:53.890> on<00:02:54.070> our<00:02:54.220> daylight<00:02:54.580> k<00:02:55.000> you<00:02:55.150> availability

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
based on our daylight k you availability

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.450 
based on our daylight k you availability
if<00:02:56.020> we<00:02:56.140> can<00:02:56.260> get<00:02:56.440> back<00:02:56.620> to<00:02:56.800> the<00:02:56.890> OBS<00:02:57.220> s

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
if we can get back to the OBS s

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.970 
if we can get back to the OBS s
inspection<00:02:58.120> and<00:02:58.390> maybe<00:02:58.660> use<00:02:58.930> the<00:02:59.230> skill

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
inspection and maybe use the skill

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.760 
inspection and maybe use the skill
cameras<00:03:00.370> to<00:03:00.670> photograph<00:03:01.030> these<00:03:01.480> objects<00:03:04.770> yeah

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
cameras to photograph these objects yeah

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.280 
cameras to photograph these objects yeah
we<00:03:05.920> understand<00:03:06.340> or<00:03:07.210> get<00:03:07.330> back<00:03:07.540> to<00:03:07.720> 0<00:03:07.750> BFS

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
we understand or get back to 0 BFS

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.190 
we understand or get back to 0 BFS
thanks
