00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
quick succession to build up your

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.600 
quick succession to build up your
multiplier<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.020> more<00:00:34.500> importantly<00:00:35.040> you're

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
multiplier and more importantly you're

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.310

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
you get hit you lose the multiplier and

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.209 
you get hit you lose the multiplier and
there's<00:00:39.510> only<00:00:39.660> 20<00:00:40.110> drones<00:00:40.379> total<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.040> you're

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
there's only 20 drones total so you're

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.680 
there's only 20 drones total so you're
not<00:00:41.340> going<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.610> be<00:00:41.700> able<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:41.969> get<00:00:42.149> hit<00:00:42.450> unless

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
not going to be able to get hit unless

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.660 
not going to be able to get hit unless
you<00:00:43.350> get<00:00:43.500> hit<00:00:43.649> maybe<00:00:43.860> at<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.070> very<00:00:44.250> beginning

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
you get hit maybe at the very beginning

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.729 
you get hit maybe at the very beginning
or<00:00:44.850> maybe<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.180> very<00:00:45.390> end<00:00:45.719> now<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.379> can<00:00:46.590> use

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
or maybe the very end now you can use

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.100 
or maybe the very end now you can use
either<00:00:47.039> firing<00:00:47.700> modes<00:00:47.940> I'm<00:00:48.210> using<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.690> Vulcan

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
little purple kind of weak spot there

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.400 
little purple kind of weak spot there
and<00:00:56.430> kind<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.670> kill<00:00:56.850> them<00:00:56.969> quickly<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.629> use

and kind of kill them quickly and use

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.200 
and kind of kill them quickly and use
your<00:00:58.649> evade<00:00:58.980> now<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.250> can<00:00:59.430> see<00:00:59.730> me<00:00:59.879> kind<00:01:00.120> of

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
your evade now you can see me kind of

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.389 
your evade now you can see me kind of
dashing<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.140> left<00:01:01.379> or<00:01:01.590> right<00:01:01.859> sometimes

dashing to the left or right sometimes
forward<00:01:02.850> or<00:01:03.000> back<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.750> dash<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.700> done<00:01:05.700> by

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
forward or back the dash is done by

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.609 
forward or back the dash is done by
hitting<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.420> left<00:01:06.659> stick<00:01:06.990> in<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.350> certain

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
hitting the left stick in a certain

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.469 
hitting the left stick in a certain
direction<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.189> then<00:01:08.369> tapping<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:09.000> X<00:01:09.180> button

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
direction and then tapping the X button

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.690 
direction and then tapping the X button
and<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:09.840> going<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.260> allow<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.400> dash

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
have to get out of the way so you can

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.640 
have to get out of the way so you can
see<00:01:23.640> my<00:01:23.790> multipliers<00:01:24.330> up<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.780> over<00:01:25.049> 20<00:01:25.439> right

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
see my multipliers up to over 20 right

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.760 
see my multipliers up to over 20 right
now<00:01:25.680> once<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.610> get<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.990> 30<00:01:27.990> it's<00:01:28.290> going<00:01:28.590> to

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
now once you get to 30 it's going to

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.200 
now once you get to 30 it's going to
your<00:01:29.280> points<00:01:29.520> are<00:01:29.579> going<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.759> add<00:01:29.850> up<00:01:29.880> real

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
your points are going to add up real

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.050 
your points are going to add up real
quick<00:01:30.500> is<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.650> think<00:01:31.710> it's<00:01:31.950> 800<00:01:32.490> or<00:01:32.610> so<00:01:32.729> once<00:01:32.939> you

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
quick is I think it's 800 or so once you

quick is I think it's 800 or so once you
hit<00:01:33.210> 30<00:01:33.450> so<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:34.350> only<00:01:34.530> have<00:01:34.740> 20<00:01:35.100> drones<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.670> get

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
hit 30 so you only have 20 drones to get

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.390
