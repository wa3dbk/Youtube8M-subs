pretty good if I was going for a nuke I
probably<00:04:52.890> would<00:04:53.070> have<00:04:53.130> got<00:04:53.280> a<00:04:53.310> nuke<00:04:53.580> the<00:04:53.760> first

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
probably would have got a nuke the first

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.060 
probably would have got a nuke the first
round<00:04:54.180> and<00:04:54.450> I<00:04:54.650> destroyed<00:04:55.650> because<00:04:55.830> I<00:04:55.979> would

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
round and I destroyed because I would

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.890 
round and I destroyed because I would
have<00:04:56.160> called<00:04:56.250> my<00:04:56.430> care<00:04:56.669> I<00:04:56.820> care<00:04:57.390> package<00:04:57.750> and

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
have called my care I care package and

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.480 
have called my care I care package and
all<00:04:57.960> that<00:04:58.110> but<00:04:58.440> I<00:04:58.530> think<00:04:58.590> nukes<00:04:58.919> are<00:04:59.070> unfair

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
all that but I think nukes are unfair

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.430 
all that but I think nukes are unfair
right<00:05:00.060> now<00:05:00.150> I'm<00:05:00.270> just<00:05:00.390> gonna<00:05:00.540> find<00:05:00.900> an<00:05:01.050> area<00:05:01.260> to

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
right now I'm just gonna find an area to

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.300 
right now I'm just gonna find an area to
hide<00:05:01.620> to<00:05:01.800> call<00:05:02.010> my<00:05:02.190> AC<00:05:02.370> 130<00:05:04.010> decided<00:05:05.010> I<00:05:05.070> just

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
hide to call my AC 130 decided I just

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.730 
hide to call my AC 130 decided I just
hide<00:05:05.460> right<00:05:05.580> here<00:05:05.790> and<00:05:06.020> i'm<00:05:07.020> using<00:05:07.200> the<00:05:07.290> ac-130

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
hide right here and i'm using the ac-130

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.440 
hide right here and i'm using the ac-130
because<00:05:07.979> i<00:05:08.070> never<00:05:08.130> really<00:05:08.490> used<00:05:08.640> it<00:05:08.790> i<00:05:08.910> usually

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
because i never really used it i usually

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:10.900 
because i never really used it i usually
just<00:05:09.660> use<00:05:09.870> the<00:05:10.050> chopper<00:05:10.350> gunner<00:05:10.530> and<00:05:10.710> I

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 
just use the chopper gunner and I

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.830 
just use the chopper gunner and I
figured<00:05:11.910> you<00:05:12.360> know<00:05:12.390> I<00:05:12.510> want<00:05:12.660> to<00:05:12.720> get<00:05:12.780> some

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
figured you know I want to get some

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.420 
figured you know I want to get some
kills<00:05:13.080> in<00:05:13.260> the<00:05:13.320> ac-130<00:05:13.830> so<00:05:14.100> right<00:05:14.220> now<00:05:14.250> I'm

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
kills in the ac-130 so right now I'm

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.310 
kills in the ac-130 so right now I'm
just<00:05:14.460> going<00:05:14.729> to<00:05:14.760> use<00:05:14.910> my<00:05:14.940> AC<00:05:15.150> 130<00:05:15.510> I'm<00:05:16.110> telling

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
just going to use my AC 130 I'm telling

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.500 
just going to use my AC 130 I'm telling
all<00:05:16.530> my<00:05:16.680> friends<00:05:16.710> teammates<00:05:17.520> that<00:05:18.360> they're

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
all my friends teammates that they're

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.620 
all my friends teammates that they're
going<00:05:18.720> towards<00:05:19.110> B<00:05:19.260> and<00:05:19.470> all<00:05:19.560> that<00:05:19.740> and<00:05:20.630> we

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
going towards B and all that and we

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.920 
going towards B and all that and we
actually<00:05:22.700> dominated<00:05:23.700> uh<00:05:24.090> we<00:05:24.750> probably

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
actually dominated uh we probably

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.570 
actually dominated uh we probably
probably<00:05:25.530> would<00:05:25.620> have<00:05:25.680> dominated<00:05:26.070> the<00:05:26.190> next

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
probably would have dominated the next

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:27.980 
probably would have dominated the next
game<00:05:26.760> but<00:05:26.940> like<00:05:27.060> I<00:05:27.090> said<00:05:27.210> the<00:05:27.450> person<00:05:27.600> was<00:05:27.840> June

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
game but like I said the person was June

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.620 
game but like I said the person was June
the<00:05:28.169> new<00:05:28.320> tubes<00:05:28.620> and<00:05:28.860> I<00:05:28.890> was<00:05:29.820> on<00:05:29.910> under<00:05:30.210> past<00:05:30.419> so

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
the new tubes and I was on under past so

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.080 
the new tubes and I was on under past so
it<00:05:30.720> was<00:05:30.810> kind<00:05:31.080> of<00:05:31.250> kind<00:05:32.250> of<00:05:32.400> hard<00:05:32.550> to<00:05:32.580> do<00:05:32.820> and

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090 
it was kind of kind of hard to do and

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.760 
it was kind of kind of hard to do and
then<00:05:33.390> they<00:05:33.479> got<00:05:33.630> advantage<00:05:34.110> over<00:05:34.260> us<00:05:34.440> today

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
then they got advantage over us today

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.730 
then they got advantage over us today
were<00:05:34.860> doing<00:05:35.250> it<00:05:35.370> they<00:05:36.030> did<00:05:36.210> shoot<00:05:36.479> down<00:05:36.690> my<00:05:36.870> AC

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
were doing it they did shoot down my AC

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.080 
were doing it they did shoot down my AC
130<00:05:38.160> and<00:05:38.490> right<00:05:38.610> here<00:05:38.729> I<00:05:38.760> do<00:05:38.820> call<00:05:39.120> my<00:05:39.270> pave<00:05:39.539> low

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
130 and right here I do call my pave low

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.659 
130 and right here I do call my pave low
and<00:05:42.090> I<00:05:43.080> do<00:05:43.500> call<00:05:43.770> my<00:05:43.919> Harrier<00:05:44.220> which<00:05:44.430> you

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.510 
a minute left I'm as well just use it

opinion<00:06:46.880> right<00:06:47.420> here<00:06:47.540> on<00:06:47.660> my<00:06:47.750> teammates<00:06:48.110> are

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:48.230 
opinion right here on my teammates are

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:49.990 
opinion right here on my teammates are
at<00:06:48.320> a<00:06:48.500> and<00:06:48.800> they<00:06:48.890> do<00:06:48.950> have<00:06:49.190> to<00:06:49.310> either<00:06:49.490> planet<00:06:49.880> a

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.000 
at a and they do have to either planet a

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.430 
at a and they do have to either planet a
or<00:06:50.120> b<00:06:50.270> and<00:06:50.510> i<00:06:50.570> guess<00:06:50.720> they<00:06:50.840> were<00:06:50.930> kept<00:06:51.110> coming

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 
or b and i guess they were kept coming

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.830 
or b and i guess they were kept coming
towards<00:06:51.770> a<00:06:52.070> so<00:06:52.850> I<00:06:52.880> figured<00:06:53.150> I'd<00:06:53.240> job<00:06:53.420> it<00:06:53.570> on<00:06:53.690> be

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840 
towards a so I figured I'd job it on be

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.950 
towards a so I figured I'd job it on be
just<00:06:54.140> to<00:06:54.230> make<00:06:54.350> sure<00:06:55.600> because<00:06:56.600> again<00:06:56.840> they

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:56.960 
just to make sure because again they

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.180 
just to make sure because again they
have<00:06:57.080> to<00:06:57.170> plant<00:06:57.380> both<00:06:57.590> bombs<00:06:57.830> and<00:06:58.040> blow<00:06:58.160> up
