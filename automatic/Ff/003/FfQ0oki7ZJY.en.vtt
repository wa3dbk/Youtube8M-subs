will only cost us $1,000 a shot well at

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.960 
will only cost us $1,000 a shot well at
that<00:02:50.450> time<00:02:50.690> and<00:02:51.620> neither<00:02:52.100> man<00:02:52.460> fact<00:02:52.700> we're<00:02:52.820> not

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970

thousand<00:02:55.460> dollar<00:02:55.670> outlay

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
thousand dollar outlay

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.970 
thousand dollar outlay
so<00:02:58.040> basically<00:02:58.460> we<00:02:58.850> let<00:02:59.030> it<00:02:59.180> go<00:02:59.330> but<00:03:00.200> since<00:03:00.590> then

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
so basically we let it go but since then

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.790 
so basically we let it go but since then
and<00:03:01.430> now<00:03:02.020> approximately<00:03:03.190> three<00:03:04.190> years<00:03:05.800> the

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
and now approximately three years the

has the cracks and pretty soon we know
it's<00:03:28.070> going<00:03:28.370> to<00:03:28.459> be<00:03:28.520> inaudible<00:03:28.870> so<00:03:29.870> we'll<00:03:30.230> be

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
it's going to be inaudible so we'll be

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.680

vehicle that operate as designed now in
my<00:03:37.520> opinion<00:03:37.870> this<00:03:38.870> is<00:03:39.290> a<00:03:39.410> safety<00:03:39.709> hazard

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320

Jeep<00:04:25.600> produced<00:04:26.140> approximately<00:04:26.470> one<00:04:26.920> hundred

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
Jeep produced approximately one hundred

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.030 
Jeep produced approximately one hundred
and<00:04:27.340> fifty<00:04:27.640> one<00:04:27.790> thousand<00:04:28.330> of<00:04:28.450> these<00:04:28.570> vehicles

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
and fifty one thousand of these vehicles

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.640 
and fifty one thousand of these vehicles
and<00:04:30.040> for<00:04:30.220> what<00:04:30.340> I've<00:04:30.490> seen<00:04:30.640> on<00:04:30.790> the<00:04:30.880> internet

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
and for what I've seen on the internet

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.700 
and for what I've seen on the internet
there's<00:04:32.650> got<00:04:32.920> to<00:04:33.100> be<00:04:33.130> at<00:04:33.460> least<00:04:33.930> 85<00:04:34.930> to<00:04:35.560> almost

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
there's got to be at least 85 to almost

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.580 
there's got to be at least 85 to almost
90%<00:04:36.100> of<00:04:36.430> those<00:04:36.580> still<00:04:36.910> on<00:04:36.940> the<00:04:37.120> road<00:04:37.330> and<00:04:37.690> if

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
90% of those still on the road and if

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.260 
90% of those still on the road and if
you<00:04:38.620> take<00:04:39.040> the<00:04:39.250> numbers<00:04:39.640> three<00:04:39.880> out<00:04:39.970> of<00:04:40.000> four

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
you take the numbers three out of four

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.910 
you take the numbers three out of four
about<00:04:40.630> doors<00:04:40.960> or<00:04:41.200> zip<00:04:41.440> it<00:04:41.530> in<00:04:41.650> the<00:04:41.740> same

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:41.920 
about doors or zip it in the same

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.240 
about doors or zip it in the same
problem<00:04:42.460> and<00:04:43.290> extrapolate<00:04:44.290> that<00:04:44.470> number<00:04:44.860> I'm

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
problem and extrapolate that number I'm

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.740 
problem and extrapolate that number I'm
not<00:04:45.400> a<00:04:45.430> mathematician<00:04:45.700> but<00:04:46.420> I<00:04:46.480> would<00:04:46.660> imagine

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
not a mathematician but I would imagine

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.890 
not a mathematician but I would imagine
at<00:04:47.350> least<00:04:47.790> seventy<00:04:48.790> percent<00:04:48.970> of<00:04:49.390> the<00:04:49.660> vehicles

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
at least seventy percent of the vehicles

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.260 
at least seventy percent of the vehicles
currently<00:04:50.620> on<00:04:50.800> the<00:04:51.010> road<00:04:51.270> probably

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
currently on the road probably

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.290 
currently on the road probably
exhibiting<00:04:53.170> the<00:04:53.560> same<00:04:53.800> issues<00:04:54.610> or<00:04:54.850> have<00:04:55.030> the

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
exhibiting the same issues or have the

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.670 
exhibiting the same issues or have the
same<00:04:55.480> issues<00:04:56.110> again<00:04:56.920> it's<00:04:57.130> a<00:04:57.220> safety<00:04:57.490> hazard

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
same issues again it's a safety hazard

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.650 
same issues again it's a safety hazard
so<00:04:59.680> the<00:04:59.890> reason<00:05:00.220> I'm<00:05:00.370> producing<00:05:01.000> this<00:05:01.150> video

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
so the reason I'm producing this video

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.120 
so the reason I'm producing this video
and<00:05:01.960> putting<00:05:02.140> it<00:05:02.230> on<00:05:02.350> youtube<00:05:02.650> hopefully

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
and putting it on youtube hopefully

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.400 
and putting it on youtube hopefully
reaching<00:05:03.460> people<00:05:04.240> who<00:05:04.450> have<00:05:04.750> the<00:05:04.870> same<00:05:05.050> issue

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
reaching people who have the same issue

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.770 
reaching people who have the same issue
and<00:05:06.370> probably<00:05:06.820> you've<00:05:07.090> gotten<00:05:07.510> the<00:05:07.600> same

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
and probably you've gotten the same

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.970 
and probably you've gotten the same
answer<00:05:08.520> from<00:05:09.520> Jeep<00:05:09.910> Chrysler<00:05:10.210> and<00:05:11.170> hoping<00:05:11.860> we

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980 
answer from Jeep Chrysler and hoping we

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.680 
answer from Jeep Chrysler and hoping we
can<00:05:12.100> belong<00:05:12.700> together

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
can belong together

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.360 
can belong together
and<00:05:13.870> maybe<00:05:14.110> go<00:05:14.320> to<00:05:14.380> Christ<00:05:14.680> and<00:05:14.950> get<00:05:15.100> them<00:05:15.250> to

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
and maybe go to Christ and get them to

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.150 
and maybe go to Christ and get them to
do<00:05:15.520> a<00:05:15.550> recall<00:05:16.030> because<00:05:16.990> this<00:05:17.200> is<00:05:17.350> like<00:05:17.890> I<00:05:17.980> said

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
do a recall because this is like I said

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.270 
do a recall because this is like I said
obviously<00:05:18.370> a<00:05:18.700> safety<00:05:19.240> hazard<00:05:19.420> and<00:05:19.930> I<00:05:20.920> wonder

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
obviously a safety hazard and I wonder

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.710 
obviously a safety hazard and I wonder
what<00:05:21.460> is<00:05:21.550> it<00:05:21.700> gonna<00:05:21.850> take<00:05:22.030> before<00:05:22.180> priceless

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
what is it gonna take before priceless

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.130 
what is it gonna take before priceless

I'm just trying to get G Chrysler to do
the<00:06:08.920> right<00:06:09.130> thing<00:06:09.460> as<00:06:10.360> I<00:06:10.540> said<00:06:10.780> before<00:06:11.640> in<00:06:12.640> my

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:12.910 
the right thing as I said before in my

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:14.790 
the right thing as I said before in my
experience<00:06:13.540> I've<00:06:13.720> owned<00:06:14.020> the<00:06:14.170> number<00:06:14.500> of<00:06:14.560> cars

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 
experience I've owned the number of cars

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.670 
experience I've owned the number of cars
the<00:06:15.520> interior<00:06:16.210> plastic<00:06:16.900> pieces<00:06:17.110> should<00:06:17.590> be

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680 
the interior plastic pieces should be

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.330 
the interior plastic pieces should be
the<00:06:17.830> last

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.340 
the last

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.670 
the last
thing<00:06:18.460> that<00:06:18.669> go<00:06:18.790> wrong<00:06:19.030> with<00:06:19.210> the<00:06:19.300> vehicle<00:06:19.680> it

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680 
thing that go wrong with the vehicle it

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.379 
thing that go wrong with the vehicle it
was<00:06:20.860> the<00:06:21.010> engine<00:06:21.370> issue<00:06:21.610> or<00:06:22.060> some<00:06:22.210> other

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:22.389 
was the engine issue or some other

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:25.920 
was the engine issue or some other
mechanical<00:06:22.570> issue<00:06:23.580> that<00:06:24.580> happens<00:06:25.090> but<00:06:25.660> this

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:25.930 
mechanical issue that happens but this

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.320 
mechanical issue that happens but this
is<00:06:26.110> not<00:06:26.260> a<00:06:26.290> moving<00:06:26.979> part<00:06:27.310> so<00:06:27.610> this<00:06:27.760> obviously

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:28.330 
is not a moving part so this obviously

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:31.920 
is not a moving part so this obviously
is<00:06:28.570> a<00:06:28.720> material<00:06:29.380> flaw<00:06:29.620> or<00:06:29.949> a<00:06:30.639> design<00:06:31.120> flaw<00:06:31.570> or

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:31.930 
is a material flaw or a design flaw or

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.030 
is a material flaw or a design flaw or
both<00:06:32.350> that<00:06:33.190> causes<00:06:33.669> this<00:06:33.820> problem<00:06:33.880> and

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:35.040 
both that causes this problem and

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.770 
both that causes this problem and
basically<00:06:36.040> is<00:06:36.160> turning<00:06:36.610> these<00:06:36.760> vehicles<00:06:37.479> into

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:37.780 
basically is turning these vehicles into
