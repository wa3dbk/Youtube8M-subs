00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:22.350
 walking 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.350
 if the number four first lengths 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.540
 and passed 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.250
 today the right 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:52.860
 big blue see themselves apply migration 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.780
 has always existed what is normal and 1 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.960
 among us a lot of people who 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.350
 come from the continents where there was the 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.390
 colonialism that's where we country gets 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.630
 are enriched 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.640
 if now these people come here 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.860
 it's because colonialism is celebrating 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.270
 still exists and always and this is the 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.979
 responsibility for us to welcome them 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.710
 to be in solidarity with people who are 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.600
 so much exploit and that's why 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.909
 I commit myself in it I also 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.800
 participated in the movement will be paid to 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:30.390
 United States before because before I 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:32.070
 put in chicago and the dynamics here in 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.070
 belgium it's pretty difficult i think 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.690
 it's difficult the support trophy 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:51.020
 but civil society but also the 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:54.369
 politicians start this march of 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.409
 gone to meet so collective his 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:00.080
 paper or with association papers 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.390
 solidarity citizens discuss with them 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:06.560
 first on the reality of each city 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.490
 and and chic and together we respond to each other 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.739
 build together 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.410
 so the purpose of this corn market is to 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.989
 create a dynamic level that exceeds 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.910
 local our main goal is 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.739
 really meet us between people who 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.150
 want to fight who are fed up with this 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.610
 political and who want to get organized 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.000
 to propose alternatives to this 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.000
 policy 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.220
 I think they have the right to have 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:38.140
 a respectful life and when we 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.040
 converses with the policy of 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.799
 capitalism and international d 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.410
 extremely rich hiding it's 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:47.480
 acceptable that these people take refuge if 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.820
 in belgium this is small especially ya 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.329
 still a lot of children too 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:56.120
 that they removed his parent is simple 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.980
 they are rather danjer who are 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.140
 dangerous and that's their poster it's 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.900
 the first poster when 26 years ago that 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.239
 they started small castle around 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.620
 regulation concerned by air or 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.160
 cotton objective criteria and 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.109
 relevant 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.190
 for jean-marc have to go back in 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:11.959
 doing what criteria 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.489
 and it's been more than twenty years since 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.620
 trying to have fixity there was so much 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.209
 we do not name ben y'a what 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.730
 problems that is playing out leaving 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.570
 So that's why rot that have 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.220
 formed to react 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.320
 we have certain values or some idea 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:30.880
 from what we want this society to be 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:33.310
 and immigration policy is not played 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:37.080
 just one facet of Commons organizes 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:40.960
 our society and how we want to 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.070
 live or how the notion of freedom 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.710
 is setup 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:47.350
 I think we see the degree of humanity 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.990
 of a democracy the way it 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.410
 treats the weakest but I think 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:55.120
 that it's complete humiliation 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:58.140
 I know a lot of people who are here 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:01.540
 for a long time they have 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:04.900
 he leads a life that tries to lead a 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.790
 decent life and that in fact are broken 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.720
 by this policy which forces them to 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.000
 live in the shadow 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.010
 I think that regulation by the 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.330
 work is a lot more a permission 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.310
 for bosses to exploit the 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.959
 undocumented people that a right 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.489
 established for undocumented people 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.139
 to be able to work with dignity 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.660
 I believe that people too who has 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:25.300
 introduces two worlds for illness 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.620
 thanks to whom we had the card removed 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.300
 Orange is saying because it's 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.580
 possible to have them at home 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.100
 whereas this is not the case we saw the 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.840
 case of a person who had an illness 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.250
 incurable who was undocumented who 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.050
 wanted to do the Nazi pile in belgium 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.600
 he was banned his so-called because 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.040
 that she does not have the papers we see a 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.470
 little bit that there is a lot more 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.610
 now of repressive policy 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.169
 concerning undocumented migrants 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.790
 incriminating people without 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:51.100
 papers the particular arrests 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.700
 charleroi as cork in Brussels and 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.810
 evictions 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.860
 I think it's time now 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.380
 because the movement of people 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.840
 undocumented a little bit has been 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.130
 immobilized by 6-7 circular of 2009 and 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.020
 it was time for us now 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.270
 currently to make things happen 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.100
 and put back on the table 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.780
 negotiations the immigration file 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.620
 in general and migration policy in 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:16.060
 Belgium 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:17.710
 hence the importance of this march and 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.970
 walk that saddam had been 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:25.090
 sympathizers that's for sure it told me ah 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:27.970
 it's true first touches the without 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:30.250
 papers after the immigrants arrived at 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:33.460
 our class should not forget and this 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:53.289
 are these people right here are going to me 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:55.979
 talk but it's going to change his very law 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:55.979
 quickly all alone 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.260
 his destiny with all that one has 

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.150
 built 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:08.480
 are we building the bridges of 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:10.960
 this march is organized and here at 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:14.840
 get organized for after April 21st 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:17.890
 that's a thousand urban circuit like 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:20.840
 health of our initiative no more 

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:23.150
 overall the sleeve the backpack but 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.050
 those who are there for the sector 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:27.020
 as they can record 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:29.480
 the brown initiative to the imap protocol 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.160
 and accepts a cat comes to leave with 

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.570
 a climb will stay here he goes 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.950
 leafleting by pumas strips 

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.950
 often I pass seven rounds
