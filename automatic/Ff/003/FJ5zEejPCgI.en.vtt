back<00:03:08.349> down<00:03:08.530> really<00:03:09.030> now<00:03:10.030> how<00:03:10.180> this<00:03:10.359> works

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
back down really now how this works

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.020 
back down really now how this works
you've<00:03:11.109> got<00:03:11.349> these<00:03:11.859> two<00:03:12.010> little<00:03:12.459> arms<00:03:12.549> and

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.210 
you've got these two little arms and
quite<00:03:13.690> often<00:03:13.870> you'll<00:03:14.140> find<00:03:14.440> them<00:03:14.620> with<00:03:15.069> them

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
quite often you'll find them with them

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.890 
quite often you'll find them with them
unclipped<00:03:15.900> which<00:03:16.900> means<00:03:17.230> it<00:03:17.349> won't<00:03:17.470> work<00:03:18.340> so

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
unclipped which means it won't work so

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.270 
unclipped which means it won't work so
what<00:03:19.900> you're<00:03:20.019> gonna<00:03:20.169> do<00:03:20.410> is<00:03:20.530> just<00:03:20.650> pop<00:03:21.099> the

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
what you're gonna do is just pop the

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
clips back on like that and you can do a

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.289 
clips back on like that and you can do a
take<00:03:26.019> off<00:03:26.200> in<00:03:26.349> London<00:03:26.530> so<00:03:27.489> that's<00:03:27.669> it<00:03:27.880> sort<00:03:28.180> of
