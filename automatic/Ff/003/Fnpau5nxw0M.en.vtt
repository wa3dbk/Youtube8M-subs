 everything absolutely everything you're going to see 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.420

 episode of this one to the consumer or of 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.789
 suvs speech is not very clear about one 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.470
 mix of the two and we go there a 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.940
 starting one bedroom killed him killed 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.530
 He killed him 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.940
 yes, I am a consumer and you have failed me 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.450
 Failed now I do not have bullets 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:30.480
 He shot Cristian Cristian and Cristian and 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:37.640
 I piro because this is the waltz of the 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:40.680
 Christians do not win a 23 1 2 3 1 2 3 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.200
 As you can see we got together three friends here 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.670
 to do the dance of the Christs and I 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.530
 I left because I said from here you can not 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.510
 leave nothing good not na na na na na and there 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.860
 I left them killing myself I left because he says 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.809
 from here nothing good can come out and as 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.640
 I do not have bullets because I'm going to kill him with the 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.890
 I kill you I kill you 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.180
 to camp and kill me I found 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.250
 with three subscribers who were talking 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.469
 between them then in the end I will put the 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.150
 names and good was pretty fun 

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:07.440
 but this is a series of this one does not know 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.610
 consumer therefore I have to do 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:13.560
 something unlike me 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.560
 what have I done 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:20.180
 and that's how roselys killed me was 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.830
 very fun attended that I pursue this 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.520
 As you know here, you only have one voucher 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:30.680
 when you kill one you recover it and there 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:32.360
 it's there he recovered it great as you see 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.440
 this belongs to the series this is not 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.480
 consume what is good and has failed 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.130
 hematoma tomás there is 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.080
 Well, as I say the game was 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.180
 pretty funny it was pretty fast 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.280
 something unusual went pretty well 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.620
 because it's literally the second 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.540
 starting from this that I play in life 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.950
 the previous good of black ops 2 the 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.150
 previous I had played it just before 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.680
 This is not possible because 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.420
 they removed the nick name and that's why 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.100
 I had to be and that yes I am 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.420

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.970

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.619
 terrific good good as well as you 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.080
 the previous one said he had played it but 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.580
 there was a host migration yes and the 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.560
 departure was fucked then this was 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.300
 really the first one that ends and as 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.700
 You see I'm doing pretty well I 'm not saying if I'm going to 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.560
 win or not but already with the title you can 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.090
 get an idea of ​​what can happen 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.530
 in this game so you do not know the 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.900
 rules as I say you only have a weapon 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.810
 you can die three times silent now 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.790
 Exact heavy 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.050
 then you can only move three times if 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.500
 you move three times you're eliminated 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.030
