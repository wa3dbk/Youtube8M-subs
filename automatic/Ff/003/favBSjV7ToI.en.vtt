00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
aforesaid so he's a small guy so I don't

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.380 
aforesaid so he's a small guy so I don't

a<00:01:40.860> bell<00:01:41.130> cow<00:01:41.369> 25<00:01:41.909> carry<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.270> game<00:01:42.600> guy<00:01:42.780> but<00:01:43.409> I

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
a bell cow 25 carry a game guy but I

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.649 
a bell cow 25 carry a game guy but I
think<00:01:43.740> he<00:01:43.860> becomes<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.430> lead<00:01:44.820> back<00:01:45.119> here<00:01:45.509> in

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
think he becomes the lead back here in

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.380 
think he becomes the lead back here in
taking<00:01:46.380> taking<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.340> role<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:48.119> at<00:01:48.329> a

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
taking taking the role that that at a

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.929 
taking taking the role that that at a
minimum<00:01:48.600> Ray<00:01:49.409> Rice<00:01:49.619> had<00:01:49.950> last<00:01:50.340> year<00:01:50.610> in<00:01:50.880> a

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
minimum Ray Rice had last year in a

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.850 
minimum Ray Rice had last year in a
timeshare<00:01:51.450> but<00:01:52.079> even<00:01:52.200> more<00:01:52.470> than<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.710> I

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
timeshare but even more than that I

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.249 
timeshare but even more than that I
think<00:01:52.979> he<00:01:53.280> becomes<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.670> lead<00:01:53.970> player<00:01:54.240> so<00:01:54.570> he's

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
think he becomes the lead player so he's

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.230 
think he becomes the lead player so he's
my<00:01:55.470> he's<00:01:55.770> my<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.009> think<00:01:56.340> he's<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.670> he's

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240
