00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.470
 stim however as I know the estimate also serves 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.470

 official team then if which English 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:47.270

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:09.840
 Italian frontals

 oh well but you can't find this everywhere 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:46.100

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.410
 setup because I have already installed it maybe 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:20.360

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.769
 we do execute 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.930
 I imagined this computer is here must 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.180
 be used to continue together 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.580

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.980
