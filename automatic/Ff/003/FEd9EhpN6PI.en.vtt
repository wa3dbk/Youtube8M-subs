00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 thank you so gamer and if you too 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.319
 times saying here wanted to drain the am 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.580
 then shows up then sends it 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.170
 here at this 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.360
 e-mail address and today with the plugin 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.280
 You can change the door 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.480
 forces of this crafting you can under 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.070
 conflict number completely yourself 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.660
 adjust with which materials one 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.460
 that can do if you then the per 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.289
 You can get proper per missions 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.730
 the forces and also put down so 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.350
 Use and if you go through this door 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.779
 then you end up in his own 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.820
 small end room and there you can 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.230
 hide boxes or other possible 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.510
 this order really only for the 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.700
 Person also because the door cracked 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.350
 I think that's funny 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.640
 idea how the whole thing looks in the game 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.110
 I'll show you but first 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.950
 of course, the plugin needs the get 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.540
 her like always below the video 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.730
 description just there on the link 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.010
 then click on download your needs 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.550
 nothing more just this plugin and 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.850
 Of course 18 with the 17 something goes 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.559
 it does not need already the 18 with 17 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.370
 10 or whatever it may be 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.690
 problems come 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.460
 you can try it but it should 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.809
 not really work if we 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.730
 we downloaded that pack 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.439
 of course as always with us in the 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.720
 I have plug-in folder here 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.520
 stop and start our server yet 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.900
 once or we will reload and watch 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.060
 if it works then always best 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.250
 a stop &amp; start and then everyone creates 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.479
 folder ender doors in the game I have 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.130
 ever created one like us 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.900
 forces at the same time but what now 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.360
 happens when we put one down then 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.020
 it's all about different doors inventory 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.619
 yes a door 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.420
 we open it and go through it 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.470
 it then turns a small room and 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.790
 this one always stays the same 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.770
 So you can really do hers now 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.600
 pack in boxes and only you have 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.740
 really forward to this space in the 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.430
 go out we just jump again 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.740
 purely 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.850
 And yes, you see I'm in the creative 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.570
 mode and can not do anything here anymore 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.710
 to destroy 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.689
 as the people can not be here 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.280
 destroy and the like and I find 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.950
 also a nice idea maybe 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.530
 something for the data is the people 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.450
 or just for the 2 gameserver a whole 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.220
 funny idea as we all the forces 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.540
 I have always prepared that 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.759
 You can easily get into the corners here 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.490
 packing obsidian then we need four 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.680
 Englishman and an iron door if we 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.810
 then configure and configure this 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.640
 binding then we get an end door 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.009
 I'll do that for a minute then you see 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.229
 here we get with rahel lila there 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.649
 the pink, we better get that 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.629
 door 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.430
 then order here I take 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.930
 something with 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.580
 we go through packed inside and then 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.770
 I show you that the chest then too 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.930
 right back out of gas because of it again 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.000
 and we see the tour is here 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.140
 you can pack your things and no one 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.010
 really has more access to it here 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.290
 unless we go in here and yes again 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.600
 okay that's a little stupid that's how it works 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.530
 in and here can our things 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.580
 get out again 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.080
 we'll take a quick look at the 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.820
 Confixx over there we can namely 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.080
 still the crafting recipe change to it 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.120
 Of course we go in our first 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.950
 plugin folder there in the underdogs 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.320
 folder and here we have the conficker 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.940
 Psion e mail to open as you see 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.580
 we have the whole rows here 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.900
 we can search for the obsidian stop here 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.120
 we want to have it written we can 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.830
 ribbons or rather write down and here 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.420
 can you then adjust your recipes so 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.130
 Diana wanted to have it 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.070
 Documents could ignore the three 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.050
 things here doors exits and spaces there 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.610
 only locations are stored where people 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.440
 come out where people leave their doors 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.570
 and what people have in theirs 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.250
 so only have spaces in there when 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.210
 you have to change the recipe 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.550
 of course once again the servers 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.230
 Stop reloaded and then start running 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.400
 that set everything as iris 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.890
 Of course you also have to per 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.030
 award missions and yes find them 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.380
 we scroll down with me 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.970
 Here you can also see the recipe again 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.160
 how it works by default and here 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.160
 again the config we then the recipe 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.140
 you have to change that, of course 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:33.600
 underdogs to use you have to forming 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.650
 can spot use in you in the 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.540
 insert promotions 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.450
 and when people can meet them 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.070
 because you do not have to forgive that 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.600
 Maybe people can do that 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.040
 buy europe in the shop then stop 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.300
 Then you just have a finished door in the 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.610
 Just put the shop in and then you can 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.650
 Buy and if they are when the people 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.330
 The craften should give then you just 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.540
 the thermal tender thirst point knows 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:56.670
 power added and yes the four ps that 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.500
 or as she wants online youtube can 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.420
 then hold the forces and here 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.590
 with can use you can stop it 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.630
 I think this is a real one 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.010
 Idea from the programmer and us 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.270
 can indeed times the eyes keep 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.830
 I think here will be more 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.140
 do something with it I say goodbye 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.280
 from the video with the underdogs if you like 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.110
 want to miss nothing presses 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.640
 just bucket on the battery and 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.440
 if you want to see more videos then 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.090
 just give up on youtube aktuarin 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.170
 and yes he's going to be bombed with 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.760
 any videos of me 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.330
 so I have until next 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.330
 video show
