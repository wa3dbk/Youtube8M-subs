this<00:02:48.010> thing<00:02:48.280> just<00:02:48.970> set<00:02:49.090> that<00:02:49.120> aside<00:02:49.390> um<00:02:50.520> let's

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
this thing just set that aside um let's

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.630 
this thing just set that aside um let's
see<00:02:51.790> here<00:02:52.060> pop<00:02:52.390> these<00:02:52.980> lens<00:02:53.980> caps<00:02:54.400> off<00:02:54.730> here

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640

see here pop these lens caps off here
that's<00:02:57.640> a<00:02:57.910> pretty<00:02:58.239> big<00:02:58.570> piece<00:02:58.870> of<00:02:59.050> glass<00:02:59.320> I

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
that's a pretty big piece of glass I

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.300 
that's a pretty big piece of glass I
believe<00:03:00.520> it's<00:03:00.700> 77<00:03:01.390> millimeters<00:03:02.050> across

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
believe it's 77 millimeters across

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.949 
believe it's 77 millimeters across
that's<00:03:03.310> going<00:03:03.580> to<00:03:03.670> be<00:03:03.760> a<00:03:03.790> big<00:03:04.000> filter<00:03:04.420> and<00:03:04.630> as<00:03:04.930> a

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
that's going to be a big filter and as a

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.940 
that's going to be a big filter and as a
constant<00:03:05.530> aperture<00:03:05.709> of<00:03:06.220> f<00:03:06.489> 2.8<00:03:07.530> that's<00:03:08.530> pretty

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
constant aperture of f 2.8 that's pretty

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.449 
constant aperture of f 2.8 that's pretty
fast<00:03:09.280> um<00:03:09.959> should<00:03:10.959> let<00:03:11.170> me<00:03:11.200> get<00:03:11.950> some<00:03:12.190> good

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
fast um should let me get some good

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.090

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
this also has a sigma calls a macro

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.910 
this also has a sigma calls a macro
