00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.820
 we are disappointed we would have liked to take points today 

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:12.569
 only accepted 

00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:13.869
 in my opinion 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:17.339
 I could not that the master very difficult but it is a match rather of 

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:19.839
 concentration it's a match that could go in one way as in 

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:20.960
 the other 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.839
 the opponents of the om in his wish to see himself form 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:26.839
 the turn of the youth houses the strong point is to say that 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.070
 a good time we had a hard time getting out of the defense we did some 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.420
 good marks in the player in front of her refusal to smile 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.940
 maroni those who have kept the ball well at times 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.130
 with the support of the young people who came in front of the second line for 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.100
 children could not 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.100
 the impromptu dance show 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.380
 it's always good to relocate because even when you do not play very 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.080
 well this case 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.170
 - by playing with 2 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.130
 is that it's that kind of character in a team that closes that makes 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.700
 so we take points 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.260
 which is frustrating to lose 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.510
 a match is folded that way 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.340
 the indexed set is football that goes like that 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.860
 the defense waiting to serve as a foundation for the address of its power plants 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.900
 I saw beautiful things on the side of belgium it is a good for the future 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.760
 we have very good things I think what makes me say that we created 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.930
 many opportunities 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.100
 we were arrested for possession not we have one we are afraid we have when 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.090
 even if this now 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.240
 meanwhile after these cessions have appreciated the same ideas of the hand 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.300
 and that's what we had to do that we created opportunities 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.970
 I think it's the right time to take them they do not have a lot of 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:27.710
 preparation 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.710
 they have a world cup that 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.540
 in the same vein as the first half the world they scored early 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.980
 so seeing so many riders for the sport is always more difficult if you have 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.630
 played with the heart today we found the Belgians 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.409
 from before I think that we have to give ourselves thoroughly for the collective there 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.390
 anyone to think of oneself 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.710
 this is even if the new attackers prefer to attack more but 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.390
 I think we were the first defenders today 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.390
 we defended well and I think we were hard to move that's it 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.350
 to remember 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.279
 it's a bit frustrating because I think 

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:12.599
 so we started the game well but it was played on them details this 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.649
 evening 

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:16.569
 we created we created a lot of opportunities in the first half 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.019
 and I think we had to find their second breath in the second 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.019
 half-time and this season has failed to make 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.129
 the first half 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:27.579
 we created a few of his congeners 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.389
 equalization it is she who is well 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:31.729
 we talked well 

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:35.069
 it's a pity that's where we are with him 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.529
 sampson points 

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:38.779
 It is exactly 

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:41.360
 it takes a hundred to know but the beautiful points 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.589
 the constructor 

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:45.480
 the next matches 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.149
 39 'written 

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:49.039
 and we'll see 

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:50.109
 disappointment for us 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:53.900
 proof of this consistent way to defend my profession of weapons to 

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:57.239
 fire were very good combination with tunisia 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.709
 but in the second half we are a little less than toronto have dropped 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.969
 deep joy for tomorrow in front of the press we failed to score 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:05.189
 his own soil 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:08.129
 but I pronounced some good ones like this combination of 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.449
 portable gaming consoles but I try to give the maximum 

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:14.989
 the rum is still an experiment in place this date for me 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:15.839
 She added 

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:18.829
 the series we repeated it he did it to 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:22.269
 a good match unfortunately it was not enough to take three points but 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.549
 this is the far and his colleagues from two clubs but for 

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:28.799
 mixes wonderfully 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.989
 because my father I would have liked to shouted to them the little surprise and 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.269
 were coming home and being able to tease them while bomber are going 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:36.249
 able to do it 

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:37.489
 I think that 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.120
 against units of account that has an offensive potential so very strong 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.129
 who are still in 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:44.169
 when I think we seemed well done 

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:47.559
 after offensively good bah they had this little bit of success all 

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:50.739
 in e1 - balloon the influx of lives all that falls to them in the feet of sow this 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.709
 that we did not succeed each time 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.469
 an amendment after one month 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:56.510
 - hit to see things like that so 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.909
 here it is and we did not have this little bit of success to mark the goal 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:01.809
 so we could have 

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:02.589
 led to the score
