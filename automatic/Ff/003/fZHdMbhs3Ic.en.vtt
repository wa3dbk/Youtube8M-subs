my life was buggered and I can do
anything<00:01:19.229> about<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.470> if<00:01:20.100> they<00:01:21.090> keep<00:01:21.360> them

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
anything about it if they keep them

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.719 
anything about it if they keep them
targeting<00:01:22.049> in<00:01:22.200> what<00:01:22.500> they<00:01:22.650> have<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.070> do<00:01:23.250> pure

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.600 
targeting in what they have to do pure
and<00:01:23.850> simple<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:25.020> will<00:01:25.320> win<00:01:25.830> damage<00:01:26.400> is

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
and simple is that will win damage is

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.030 
and simple is that will win damage is
completely<00:01:27.420> separate<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.500> body<00:01:28.740> damage

legs solely in them locking in the
symbol<00:01:44.159> like<00:01:44.280> crap<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.759> not<00:01:45.000> enough<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.540> have

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
symbol like crap is not enough you have

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.649 
symbol like crap is not enough you have
to<00:01:45.930> do<00:01:46.350> more<00:01:46.619> damage<00:01:46.890> health<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:48.149> much<00:01:48.329> I

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
to do more damage health that much I

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:49.910 
to do more damage health that much I
think<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:49.020> has<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.259> be<00:01:49.320> two<00:01:49.500> separate<00:01:49.799> things

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
think that has to be two separate things

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.560 
think that has to be two separate things
because<00:01:50.189> right<00:01:50.340> now<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.970> can<00:01:51.149> slowly<00:01:51.299> work

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
because right now you can slowly work

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.719 
because right now you can slowly work
the<00:01:51.720> leg<00:01:51.899> lock<00:01:52.560> in<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.829> figure-four<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.579> it's

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
the leg lock in the figure-four and it's

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:54.319 
the leg lock in the figure-four and it's
game<00:01:53.939> over

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
game over

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.679 
game over
and<00:01:54.509> that's<00:01:55.079> bollocks<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.340> be<00:01:56.460> honest<00:01:56.759> Haven

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
and that's bollocks to be honest Haven

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.929 
and that's bollocks to be honest Haven
simple<00:01:58.110> so<00:01:58.740> that's<00:01:58.829> my<00:01:59.040> suggestion<00:01:59.369> either

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
simple so that's my suggestion either

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.459 
simple so that's my suggestion either
that<00:02:00.119> or<00:02:00.299> just<00:02:00.420> remove<00:02:00.869> limb<00:02:01.079> toxin

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
that or just remove limb toxin

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.200 
that or just remove limb toxin
completely<00:02:01.860> it's<00:02:02.009> unnecessary<00:02:02.939> in<00:02:03.060> my

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
completely it's unnecessary in my

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.240 
completely it's unnecessary in my
opinion<00:02:03.630> because<00:02:03.990> people<00:02:04.500> who<00:02:04.649> work<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.070> leg

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
opinion because people who work the leg

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.429 
opinion because people who work the leg
