the prices sequence and recipe we are

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.540 
the prices sequence and recipe we are
proving<00:03:06.810> that<00:03:07.019> we<00:03:07.379> have<00:03:07.560> a<00:03:07.590> more<00:03:08.220> premium

proving that we have a more premium

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:16.260 
proving that we have a more premium
approach

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.050 

there's<00:03:16.750> no<00:03:17.100> words<00:03:18.100> that<00:03:18.370> has<00:03:18.700> which<00:03:18.910> is

there's no words that has which is

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.780 

concept<00:05:38.080> we<00:05:38.530> have<00:05:38.650> a<00:05:38.710> new<00:05:38.860> color<00:05:39.160> scheme<00:05:39.400> we

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:39.790 
concept we have a new color scheme we

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.170 
concept we have a new color scheme we
have<00:05:39.880> a<00:05:39.910> new<00:05:40.060> design<00:05:40.240> scheme<00:05:40.840> basically<00:05:41.530> and

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
have a new design scheme basically and

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.300 
have a new design scheme basically and
what<00:05:43.180> you<00:05:43.300> see<00:05:43.510> here<00:05:43.840> is<00:05:44.230> obviously<00:05:44.770> just<00:05:45.220> the

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
members are making this a complete

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.690 
members are making this a complete
product<00:05:53.290> I'm<00:05:53.980> very<00:05:54.160> proud<00:05:54.370> of<00:05:54.430> that

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:54.700 
product I'm very proud of that

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.300 
product I'm very proud of that
because<00:05:55.450> as<00:05:55.690> always<00:05:55.930> today<00:05:56.350> to<00:05:56.800> travel<00:05:57.160> with

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
because as always today to travel with

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.090 
because as always today to travel with
Lufthansa<00:05:57.850> it's<00:05:58.540> not<00:05:58.780> a<00:05:59.050> Kapil<00:05:59.470> it's<00:05:59.860> not<00:06:00.070> a

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:00.100 
Lufthansa it's not a Kapil it's not a

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.520 
Lufthansa it's not a Kapil it's not a
game<00:06:00.490> of<00:06:00.640> uncertainty<00:06:01.270> it's<00:06:01.780> basically<00:06:02.260> you

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:02.530 
game of uncertainty it's basically you

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.710 
game of uncertainty it's basically you
can<00:06:02.710> rely<00:06:03.040> on<00:06:03.070> that<00:06:03.490> you<00:06:03.850> not<00:06:04.000> only<00:06:04.150> get<00:06:04.450> a

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 
can rely on that you not only get a

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.260 
can rely on that you not only get a
great<00:06:05.230> airplane<00:06:05.590> which<00:06:06.160> is<00:06:06.370> heavily

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
great airplane which is heavily

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.710 
great airplane which is heavily
maintained<00:06:08.110> and<00:06:08.440> in<00:06:08.530> the<00:06:08.740> best<00:06:08.950> possible<00:06:09.190> way

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 
maintained and in the best possible way

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.880 
maintained and in the best possible way
and<00:06:12.120> if<00:06:13.120> you<00:06:13.270> walk<00:06:13.630> around<00:06:13.840> you<00:06:14.350> won't<00:06:14.560> hear

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:14.890 
and if you walk around you won't hear

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.190 
and if you walk around you won't hear
any<00:06:15.130> bounces<00:06:15.820> when<00:06:16.150> a<00:06:16.450> flight<00:06:16.720> attendant

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:17.200 
any bounces when a flight attendant

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.130 
any bounces when a flight attendant
walks<00:06:17.380> by<00:06:17.650> we<00:06:18.400> also<00:06:18.580> have<00:06:19.030> incorporated<00:06:19.810> a

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:20.140 
walks by we also have incorporated a

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.590 
walks by we also have incorporated a
noise<00:06:20.680> cancellation<00:06:21.310> system<00:06:21.730> into<00:06:22.270> the<00:06:22.420> outer

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:22.600 
noise cancellation system into the outer

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.750 
noise cancellation system into the outer
shell<00:06:22.990> of<00:06:23.170> the<00:06:23.290> airplane<00:06:23.680> which<00:06:24.340> basically

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:24.760 
shell of the airplane which basically

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.320 
shell of the airplane which basically
music<00:06:25.360> and<00:06:25.780> it<00:06:26.530> reduces<00:06:27.370> the<00:06:27.610> noise<00:06:27.790> level

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:28.330 
music and it reduces the noise level

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.200 
music and it reduces the noise level
inside<00:06:28.870> the<00:06:29.110> commitment<00:06:29.680> the<00:06:29.770> cabin

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.210 
inside the commitment the cabin

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:33.060 
inside the commitment the cabin
significantly<00:06:31.210> also<00:06:31.930> we<00:06:32.320> have<00:06:32.500> some<00:06:32.710> noise

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:33.070 
significantly also we have some noise

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.420 
significantly also we have some noise
ken's<00:06:33.880> reducing<00:06:34.810> curtains<00:06:35.650> which<00:06:36.010> we<00:06:36.190> use

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.430 
ken's reducing curtains which we use

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.390 
ken's reducing curtains which we use
behind<00:06:36.970> the<00:06:37.120> first-class<00:06:37.450> compartment<00:06:38.400> for

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:39.400 
behind the first-class compartment for

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.610 
behind the first-class compartment for
the<00:06:39.490> galley<00:06:39.700> that<00:06:40.150> you<00:06:40.540> will<00:06:40.750> really<00:06:41.020> not<00:06:41.350> get

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:41.620 
the galley that you will really not get

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.280 
the galley that you will really not get
disturbed<00:06:42.040> by<00:06:42.340> these<00:06:42.730> guys

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:44.290 
disturbed by these guys

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:47.580 
disturbed by these guys
that's<00:06:44.920> right<00:06:45.190> yeah<00:06:45.840> yeah<00:06:46.840> but<00:06:47.050> this<00:06:47.170> is<00:06:47.350> as<00:06:47.470> I

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:47.590 
that's right yeah yeah but this is as I

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:50.220 
that's right yeah yeah but this is as I
said<00:06:47.620> also<00:06:48.190> a<00:06:48.220> part<00:06:48.610> of<00:06:48.790> the<00:06:48.880> noise<00:06:49.230> concept

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:50.230 
said also a part of the noise concept

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.200 
said also a part of the noise concept
noise<00:06:50.410> cancellation<00:06:51.160> concept<00:06:51.670> I<00:06:51.790> mean<00:06:51.970> if<00:06:52.120> you

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:52.210 
noise cancellation concept I mean if you

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:54.900 
noise cancellation concept I mean if you
