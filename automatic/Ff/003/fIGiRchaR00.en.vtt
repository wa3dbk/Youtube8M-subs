with<00:00:16.859> my<00:00:17.039> web<00:00:17.250> server<00:00:17.550> now<00:00:18.390> how<00:00:18.660> do<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:18.930> go<00:00:19.199> about

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
with my web server now how do I go about

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.700 
with my web server now how do I go about
doing<00:00:19.529> that<00:00:20.160> well<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.359> easiest<00:00:21.720> method<00:00:22.260> is<00:00:22.380> to

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
doing that well the easiest method is to

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.279 
doing that well the easiest method is to
just<00:00:22.949> choose<00:00:23.250> some<00:00:23.580> files<00:00:24.000> from<00:00:24.630> within<00:00:24.869> my

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
just choose some files from within my

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.160 
just choose some files from within my
local<00:00:25.590> files<00:00:26.070> panel<00:00:26.599> since<00:00:27.599> this<00:00:27.840> is<00:00:27.990> the

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
local files panel since this is the

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.900 
local files panel since this is the
first<00:00:28.470> time<00:00:28.830> I'm<00:00:29.099> going<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.519> upload
