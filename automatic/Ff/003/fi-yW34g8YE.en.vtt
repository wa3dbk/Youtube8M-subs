00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
another driver and then it comes down to

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.700 
another driver and then it comes down to
with<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:39.390> know<00:00:39.510> lifting<00:00:39.840> before<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.559> other

the other driver so it's basically very

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.930 
the other driver so it's basically very
challenging<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.620> go<00:00:43.800> side<00:00:44.219> by<00:00:44.250> side<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.820> the

why<00:01:35.659> do<00:01:35.719> you<00:01:35.990> use<00:01:36.200> pit<00:01:36.560> boards<00:01:37.099> if<00:01:37.340> you<00:01:37.610> can

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
why do you use pit boards if you can

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.850 
why do you use pit boards if you can
just<00:01:37.969> use<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:38.360> radio<00:01:38.569> I<00:01:38.899> don't<00:01:39.110> think<00:01:39.709> it

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
just use the radio I don't think it

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.440 
just use the radio I don't think it
would<00:01:40.009> be<00:01:40.099> that<00:01:40.129> easy<00:01:40.459> to<00:01:40.759> read<00:01:41.090> if<00:01:41.299> you're

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450
