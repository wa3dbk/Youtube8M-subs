00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
really be that competitive so when you

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.789

the most part there's new iterations of

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.330 
the most part there's new iterations of
the<00:02:25.930> game<00:02:25.959> but<00:02:26.349> they<00:02:26.439> don't<00:02:26.620> come<00:02:26.799> out<00:02:26.920> every

a<00:02:39.040> few<00:02:39.310> months<00:02:39.609> to<00:02:39.730> pretty<00:02:39.909> much<00:02:40.000> learn<00:02:40.209> the

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:40.359 
a few months to pretty much learn the

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:42.659 
a few months to pretty much learn the
game<00:02:40.540> and<00:02:40.780> start<00:02:40.959> the<00:02:41.109> season<00:02:41.290> and<00:02:41.709> guess<00:02:42.430> what

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:42.669 
game and start the season and guess what

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:44.580 
game and start the season and guess what
that's<00:02:43.060> not<00:02:43.180> really<00:02:43.569> that<00:02:43.599> helpful<00:02:44.200> because

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
that's not really that helpful because

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.649 
that's not really that helpful because
you<00:02:44.709> can't<00:02:45.069> master<00:02:45.310> a<00:02:45.519> game<00:02:45.790> in<00:02:46.030> that<00:02:46.239> short<00:02:46.540> of

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:46.659 
you can't master a game in that short of

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:48.569 
you can't master a game in that short of
a<00:02:46.750> time<00:02:46.959> frame<00:02:47.260> or<00:02:47.560> at<00:02:47.650> least<00:02:47.799> in<00:02:47.980> my<00:02:48.129> opinion

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
a time frame or at least in my opinion

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.520 
a time frame or at least in my opinion
you<00:02:48.669> can<00:02:48.700> and<00:02:49.150> this<00:02:49.540> leads<00:02:49.780> to<00:02:49.900> players<00:02:50.230> having

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
you can and this leads to players having

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.379 
you can and this leads to players having
to<00:02:50.620> pick<00:02:50.799> up<00:02:50.829> games<00:02:51.189> being<00:02:51.489> good<00:02:51.879> at<00:02:52.000> some<00:02:52.209> Call

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:52.389 
to pick up games being good at some Call

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:53.699 
to pick up games being good at some Call
of<00:02:52.419> Duty's<00:02:52.750> and<00:02:52.900> not<00:02:53.049> good<00:02:53.230> at<00:02:53.319> the<00:02:53.409> future

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
of Duty's and not good at the future

Call of Duty's and it just seems like a
big<00:02:55.840> clusterfuck<00:02:56.530> what<00:02:57.189> I<00:02:57.219> think<00:02:57.489> they<00:02:57.549> should

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
big clusterfuck what I think they should

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.849 
big clusterfuck what I think they should
do<00:02:57.849> is<00:02:58.090> release<00:02:58.480> a<00:02:58.689> Call<00:02:58.930> of<00:02:58.959> Duty<00:02:59.379> pretty<00:02:59.680> much

00:02:59.849 --> 00:02:59.859 
do is release a Call of Duty pretty much

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:01.800 
do is release a Call of Duty pretty much

they're changing teams so often it's

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.429 
they're changing teams so often it's
hard<00:03:45.340> to<00:03:45.609> build<00:03:45.879> up<00:03:46.030> loyalty<00:03:46.509> when<00:03:47.019> the<00:03:47.169> core

00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:47.439 
hard to build up loyalty when the core

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:49.860 
hard to build up loyalty when the core
team<00:03:47.709> keeps<00:03:48.040> changing<00:03:48.310> every<00:03:49.150> single<00:03:49.629> year

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
team keeps changing every single year

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.020 
team keeps changing every single year
and<00:03:50.079> this<00:03:50.169> goes<00:03:50.379> back<00:03:50.590> to<00:03:50.620> the<00:03:51.340> games<00:03:51.579> changing

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
and this goes back to the games changing

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.369 
and this goes back to the games changing
every<00:03:52.180> year<00:03:52.209> and<00:03:52.569> some<00:03:52.720> people<00:03:52.989> not<00:03:53.169> being

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:53.379

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:55.349 
every year and some people not being
good<00:03:53.709> at<00:03:54.009> the<00:03:54.250> newer<00:03:54.430> games<00:03:54.669> as<00:03:54.939> they<00:03:55.090> were<00:03:55.150> the

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
good at the newer games as they were the

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:58.140 
good at the newer games as they were the
older<00:03:55.629> game<00:03:55.810> so<00:03:56.290> they<00:03:56.680> get<00:03:56.889> replaced<00:03:57.310> this<00:03:58.030> is

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
older game so they get replaced this is

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.789 
older game so they get replaced this is
what<00:03:58.269> ends<00:03:58.509> up<00:03:58.569> happening<00:03:58.629> when<00:03:59.349> the<00:03:59.620> game

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
what ends up happening when the game

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.159 
what ends up happening when the game
isn't<00:04:00.159> built<00:04:00.400> for<00:04:00.459> eSports<00:04:01.090> and<00:04:01.299> the<00:04:01.840> roster

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:02.169 
isn't built for eSports and the roster

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:05.219 
isn't built for eSports and the roster
changes<00:04:02.500> just<00:04:02.799> make<00:04:03.099> the<00:04:03.280> game<00:04:03.780> not<00:04:04.780> really

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:05.229 
changes just make the game not really

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:06.869 
changes just make the game not really
that<00:04:05.439> fun<00:04:05.680> to<00:04:05.829> watch<00:04:05.979> because<00:04:06.280> you<00:04:06.459> don't<00:04:06.669> even

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:06.879 
that fun to watch because you don't even

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:08.219 
that fun to watch because you don't even
know<00:04:07.030> who<00:04:07.150> you're<00:04:07.239> rooting<00:04:07.389> for<00:04:07.599> and<00:04:08.109> you

know who you're rooting for and you

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:09.719 
know who you're rooting for and you
probably<00:04:08.469> can't<00:04:08.769> even<00:04:08.949> name<00:04:09.069> half<00:04:09.310> the<00:04:09.459> people

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:09.729 
probably can't even name half the people

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:11.219 
probably can't even name half the people
on<00:04:09.849> your<00:04:09.939> favorite<00:04:10.269> team<00:04:10.299> anymore<00:04:10.840> but<00:04:11.109> this

on your favorite team anymore but this

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:13.289 
on your favorite team anymore but this
is<00:04:11.409> just<00:04:11.650> my<00:04:11.919> opinion<00:04:12.099> on<00:04:12.459> why<00:04:12.639> Call<00:04:13.000> of<00:04:13.030> Duty

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
is just my opinion on why Call of Duty

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:15.869 
is just my opinion on why Call of Duty
eSports<00:04:13.659> are<00:04:13.810> trying<00:04:14.259> to<00:04:14.500> catch<00:04:14.739> up<00:04:14.979> to<00:04:15.189> csgo

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:15.879 
eSports are trying to catch up to csgo

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:17.789 
eSports are trying to catch up to csgo
eSports<00:04:16.419> and<00:04:16.599> why<00:04:16.900> I<00:04:16.930> don't<00:04:17.409> think<00:04:17.680> they're

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
eSports and why I don't think they're

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.289 
eSports and why I don't think they're
going<00:04:17.889> to<00:04:17.949> be<00:04:18.070> able<00:04:18.159> to<00:04:18.370> unless<00:04:18.759> some<00:04:19.000> major
