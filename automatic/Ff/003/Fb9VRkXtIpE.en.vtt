Russian<00:04:25.620> African<00:04:26.010> violet<00:04:26.280> society<00:04:26.789> and<00:04:27.060> we

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
Russian African violet society and we

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.409 
Russian African violet society and we
actually<00:04:28.430> came<00:04:29.430> up<00:04:29.460> with<00:04:29.550> a<00:04:29.699> plan<00:04:29.940> that<00:04:29.970> I

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
actually came up with a plan that I

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:32.180 
actually came up with a plan that I
would<00:04:30.690> just<00:04:30.870> send<00:04:31.020> him<00:04:31.229> the<00:04:31.410> plants<00:04:31.830> a<00:04:31.979> little

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
would just send him the plants a little

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.010 
would just send him the plants a little
bit<00:04:32.280> earlier<00:04:32.669> and<00:04:33.330> he<00:04:33.510> would<00:04:33.630> be<00:04:33.780> able<00:04:33.870> to

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
bit earlier and he would be able to

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.529 
bit earlier and he would be able to
release<00:04:34.919> the<00:04:35.100> plants<00:04:35.460> over<00:04:35.940> there<00:04:36.180> about<00:04:36.479> the

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
so to speak and that's worked out worked

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.900 
so to speak and that's worked out worked
out<00:04:48.900> very<00:04:49.169> well<00:04:49.260> so<00:04:49.710> we<00:04:50.280> can<00:04:50.430> concentrate<00:04:50.760> on

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
out very well so we can concentrate on

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:53.930 
out very well so we can concentrate on
the<00:04:51.120> other<00:04:51.270> countries<00:04:52.669> our<00:04:53.669> biggest

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
the other countries our biggest

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.700 
the other countries our biggest
challenge<00:04:54.150> these<00:04:54.750> days<00:04:54.780> and<00:04:55.320> I<00:04:55.380> think<00:04:55.590> it's

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
challenge these days and I think it's

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.620 
challenge these days and I think it's
affecting<00:04:56.160> not<00:04:56.280> only<00:04:56.340> other<00:04:56.700> violet<00:04:57.210> growers

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
affecting not only other violet growers

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.120 
affecting not only other violet growers
but<00:04:57.870> other<00:04:59.090> plant<00:05:00.090> growers<00:05:00.360> too<00:05:00.720> is<00:05:01.130> getting
