 hopscotch and good spinner 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.300
 consistent the secret lies in the 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:31.710
 braking temperature and personnel per 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.899
 It does not say everything here 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.329
 are these details that make flour 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.430

 to ensure that quality is already 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.140
 the characteristic of the marine farm 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.600
 begins there that the flour that the 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.340
 made of flour dough that is public 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.170
 here in the region that the mass that goes 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.920
 for the water is soaked there until 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.620
 soften 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.750
 Then I came here for the system here. 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.769
 within that pocket we can talk 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.840
