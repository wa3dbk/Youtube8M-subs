00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
of festival look all these maps look to

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.830 
of festival look all these maps look to
be<00:02:04.710> kind<00:02:05.009> of<00:02:05.130> small<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.729> medium<00:02:06.090> i'd<00:02:06.270> say<00:02:06.479> more

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
be kind of small to medium i'd say more

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.169 
be kind of small to medium i'd say more
or<00:02:06.990> less<00:02:07.259> this<00:02:07.469> small<00:02:07.799> part<00:02:08.160> but<00:02:08.670> let's<00:02:08.970> get<00:02:09.060> on

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
or less this small part but let's get on

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.940 
or less this small part but let's get on
with<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.390> second<00:02:09.720> month<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.349> second<00:02:10.800> map

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
with the second month so the second map

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.470 
with the second month so the second map
looks<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.340> be<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.459> bit<00:02:11.640> out<00:02:11.760> of<00:02:11.790> context<00:02:12.330> it's

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
looks to be a bit out of context it's

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.800 
looks to be a bit out of context it's
actually<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:13.020> parrot

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
actually a parrot

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.830 
actually a parrot
if<00:02:13.870> in<00:02:14.560> a<00:02:14.830> doc<00:02:15.099> and<00:02:15.459> that's<00:02:16.180> literally<00:02:16.540> all<00:02:16.660> I

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
if in a doc and that's literally all I

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.630 
if in a doc and that's literally all I
can<00:02:17.050> really<00:02:17.140> say<00:02:17.290> about<00:02:17.470> that<00:02:17.830> it<00:02:18.190> looks<00:02:18.340> kind

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
can really say about that it looks kind

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.280 
can really say about that it looks kind
of<00:02:18.730> bit<00:02:18.880> out<00:02:19.000> of<00:02:19.030> context<00:02:19.510> it's<00:02:19.660> a<00:02:19.780> bit<00:02:19.900> random

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
of bit out of context it's a bit random

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.680 
of bit out of context it's a bit random
that<00:02:20.440> put<00:02:21.010> that<00:02:21.130> there<00:02:21.310> boy<00:02:21.640> and<00:02:21.849> we'll<00:02:22.540> see

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
that put that there boy and we'll see

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:23.880 
that put that there boy and we'll see
well<00:02:22.840> that's<00:02:22.989> going<00:02:23.110> to<00:02:23.170> be<00:02:23.230> like<00:02:23.380> again<00:02:23.709> the

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
well that's going to be like again the

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.160 
well that's going to be like again the
maps<00:02:24.069> do<00:02:24.220> look<00:02:24.340> pretty<00:02:24.489> small<00:02:25.000> going<00:02:25.959> to<00:02:26.050> the

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
maps do look pretty small going to the

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.600 
maps do look pretty small going to the
third<00:02:26.380> map<00:02:26.650> the<00:02:26.800> Thames<00:02:26.980> up<00:02:27.160> is<00:02:27.280> known<00:02:27.430> as

third map the Thames up is known as

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.000 
third map the Thames up is known as
bahara<00:02:28.060> and<00:02:28.510> this<00:02:28.780> map<00:02:29.050> actually<00:02:29.650> has<00:02:29.980> a

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
bahara and this map actually has a

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.720 
bahara and this map actually has a
side-by-side<00:02:31.650> picture<00:02:32.650> someone<00:02:33.130> has<00:02:33.370> made

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
side-by-side picture someone has made

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.970

i'll put every link in the description
below<00:02:36.160> and<00:02:36.519> then<00:02:37.150> this<00:02:37.450> picture<00:02:37.870> is<00:02:38.019> showing<00:02:38.470> a

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
below and then this picture is showing a

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.589 
below and then this picture is showing a
side<00:02:38.950> by<00:02:39.130> side<00:02:39.370> view<00:02:39.610> with<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:39.790> map<00:02:40.120> for<00:02:40.360> villa

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
side by side view with the map for villa

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.050 
side by side view with the map for villa
and<00:02:40.840> it<00:02:40.930> looks<00:02:41.080> very<00:02:41.170> similar<00:02:41.800> to<00:02:42.040> favela<00:02:42.760> so

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
and it looks very similar to favela so

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.580 
and it looks very similar to favela so
it<00:02:43.150> looks<00:02:43.330> like<00:02:43.420> we<00:02:43.630> may<00:02:43.840> be<00:02:43.870> getting<00:02:44.080> a<00:02:44.349> favela

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
it looks like we may be getting a favela

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.880 
it looks like we may be getting a favela
remake<00:02:45.580> so<00:02:46.299> yeah<00:02:46.840> it's<00:02:47.140> called<00:02:47.260> behera<00:02:47.620> it

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
remake so yeah it's called behera it

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.470 
remake so yeah it's called behera it
looks<00:02:48.250> like<00:02:48.459> it's<00:02:48.640> based<00:02:48.819> in<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.090> desert<00:02:49.390> it

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
looks like it's based in the desert it

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.539 
looks like it's based in the desert it
kind<00:02:49.660> of<00:02:49.690> reminds<00:02:49.959> me<00:02:50.019> of<00:02:50.140> big<00:02:50.709> from<00:02:51.069> black<00:02:51.340> ops

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
kind of reminds me of big from black ops

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.030 
kind of reminds me of big from black ops
2<00:02:51.819> I<00:02:51.850> think<00:02:52.150> that<00:02:52.299> was<00:02:52.510> a<00:02:52.690> bit<00:02:53.470> like<00:02:53.620> that<00:02:53.860> but

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
2 I think that was a bit like that but

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.979 
2 I think that was a bit like that but
again<00:02:54.280> it<00:02:54.459> looks<00:02:54.489> very<00:02:54.730> like<00:02:55.180> favela<00:02:55.630> in<00:02:55.840> this

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
again it looks very like favela in this

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.440 
again it looks very like favela in this
position<00:02:56.500> of<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:57.130> foot<00:02:57.160> again<00:02:57.940> everything

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
position of the foot again everything

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.680 
position of the foot again everything
