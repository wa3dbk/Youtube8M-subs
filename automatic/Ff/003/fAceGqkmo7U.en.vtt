00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
day I thought there were some really

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.709 
day I thought there were some really
good<00:00:43.890> things<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.940> know<00:00:45.030> just<00:00:45.239> thinking<00:00:45.480> back

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
good things you know just thinking back

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.479 
good things you know just thinking back
to<00:00:45.780> two<00:00:46.050> years<00:00:46.289> ago<00:00:46.469> being<00:00:46.860> on<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.010> same<00:00:47.219> field

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
to two years ago being on the same field

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.920 
to two years ago being on the same field
I<00:00:47.610> think<00:00:47.760> we've<00:00:47.850> come<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.090> long<00:00:48.180> ways<00:00:48.600> as<00:00:48.840> you

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
I think we've come a long ways as you

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.650 
I think we've come a long ways as you
look<00:00:49.110> around<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.620> at<00:00:49.800> at<00:00:50.520> our<00:00:50.879> players<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.539> way

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
look around it at at our players the way

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.630 
look around it at at our players the way
they<00:00:51.809> look<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.230> how<00:00:52.350> they<00:00:52.530> run<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.010> so

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
they look and how they run and so

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.520 
they look and how they run and so
against<00:00:54.180> ahead<00:00:54.420> credit<00:00:54.750> obviously<00:00:55.079> does<00:00:55.260> just

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
against ahead credit obviously does just

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.959 
against ahead credit obviously does just
a<00:00:55.590> coach<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:55.920> recruiting<00:00:56.070> but<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.489> lot<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.940> our

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
a coach and recruiting but I lot to our

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.310 
a coach and recruiting but I lot to our
strengths<00:00:57.329> staff

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
strengths staff

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.050 
strengths staff
I<00:00:58.380> think<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:58.890> our<00:00:58.980> guys<00:00:59.160> look<00:00:59.670> really<00:00:59.700> good

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:00.060 
I think that our guys look really good

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.000 
I think that our guys look really good
obviously<00:01:00.810> we<00:01:00.930> have<00:01:01.020> some<00:01:01.170> depth<00:01:01.380> concerns<00:01:01.800> in

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
obviously we have some depth concerns in

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.110 
obviously we have some depth concerns in
a<00:01:02.070> number<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.340> spots

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
a number of spots

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.750 
a number of spots
as<00:01:04.540> far<00:01:04.810> as<00:01:04.840> you<00:01:05.560> know<00:01:05.680> the<00:01:06.070> MVP<00:01:06.460> of<00:01:06.490> the<00:01:06.610> day

is<00:01:13.940> very<00:01:14.390> different<00:01:14.660> than<00:01:14.810> the<00:01:15.020> last<00:01:15.140> time<00:01:15.500> we

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
is very different than the last time we

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.410 
is very different than the last time we
were<00:01:15.770> with<00:01:15.890> them<00:01:16.070> so<00:01:16.370> obviously<00:01:17.090> that<00:01:17.240> was

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
were with them so obviously that was

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.390 
were with them so obviously that was
great<00:01:17.630> to<00:01:17.660> see<00:01:17.780> it<00:01:18.770> doesn't<00:01:18.920> change<00:01:19.100> the<00:01:19.310> way

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
great to see it doesn't change the way

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.860 
great to see it doesn't change the way
you<00:01:19.460> prepared<00:01:19.970> but<00:01:20.120> just<00:01:20.300> not<00:01:20.450> having<00:01:20.750> that

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870

dark<00:01:21.229> cloud<00:01:21.470> hanging<00:01:21.710> over<00:01:21.950> you<00:01:22.160> guys<00:01:22.310> anymore

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
dark cloud hanging over you guys anymore

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.070 
dark cloud hanging over you guys anymore
knowing<00:01:22.910> that<00:01:23.120> these<00:01:23.210> guys<00:01:23.360> are<00:01:23.420> preparing

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
knowing that these guys are preparing

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.960 
knowing that these guys are preparing
for<00:01:24.740> something<00:01:24.860> bigger<00:01:25.310> than<00:01:25.370> they've<00:01:25.760> been

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
for something bigger than they've been

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.400 
for something bigger than they've been
able<00:01:26.060> to<00:01:26.300> play<00:01:26.510> for<00:01:26.570> the<00:01:26.780> last<00:01:26.960> two<00:01:27.080> years<00:01:27.110> I

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.410 
able to play for the last two years I

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.230

you know and to our players but it

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.070 
you know and to our players but it

doesn't change anything that we do and

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.750 
doesn't change anything that we do and
we're<00:01:33.260> honest<00:01:33.590> and<00:01:33.770> prepare<00:01:34.160> any<00:01:34.400> different

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.890 
reduce it was a different feeling you
hear<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.170> song<00:01:46.120> blasting<00:01:47.120> up<00:01:47.240> speakers<00:01:47.570> I<00:01:47.750> get

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
hear the song blasting up speakers I get

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.840 
hear the song blasting up speakers I get
a<00:01:47.930> good<00:01:48.080> feeling<00:01:48.140> seemed<00:01:48.710> representative<00:01:49.670> of

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
a good feeling seemed representative of

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.880 
a good feeling seemed representative of
how<00:01:50.030> the<00:01:50.090> players<00:01:50.390> are<00:01:50.600> feeling<00:01:50.870> today<00:01:51.080> well<00:01:51.860> I

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
how the players are feeling today well I

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.500 
how the players are feeling today well I
don't<00:01:52.010> know<00:01:52.280> that<00:01:52.460> that's<00:01:52.580> necessarily<00:01:52.910> the

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
don't know that that's necessarily the

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.840 
don't know that that's necessarily the
bowl<00:01:54.080> game<00:01:54.350> I<00:01:54.650> think<00:01:55.100> that's<00:01:55.310> just<00:01:55.400> in<00:01:55.640> general

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
bowl game I think that's just in general

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:56.830 
bowl game I think that's just in general
I<00:01:56.030> think<00:01:56.060> they<00:01:56.240> feel<00:01:56.420> good<00:01:56.600> about<00:01:56.660> themselves

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
I think they feel good about themselves

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.660 
I think they feel good about themselves
they<00:01:57.440> feel<00:01:57.620> confident<00:01:58.130> because<00:01:58.190> they<00:01:58.490> came

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
they feel confident because they came

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.060 
they feel confident because they came
off<00:01:58.820> of<00:01:58.930> eating<00:01:59.930> this<00:02:00.020> season<00:02:00.380> very<00:02:00.710> well<00:02:00.920> in<00:02:01.010> a

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
off of eating this season very well in a

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.190 
off of eating this season very well in a
number<00:02:01.400> of<00:02:01.430> the<00:02:01.610> returners<00:02:02.180> were<00:02:02.390> significant

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
number of the returners were significant

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.280 
number of the returners were significant
players<00:02:03.890> some<00:02:04.550> all<00:02:04.729> Americans<00:02:05.270> so<00:02:05.450> that's

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
players some all Americans so that's

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.139 
players some all Americans so that's
very<00:02:06.410> different<00:02:06.860> than<00:02:07.040> the<00:02:07.160> year<00:02:07.340> before<00:02:07.460> you

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
very different than the year before you

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.030 
very different than the year before you
know<00:02:08.270> or<00:02:08.540> especially<00:02:08.959> the<00:02:09.170> tears<00:02:09.560> before<00:02:09.740> that

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
know or especially the tears before that

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.920 
know or especially the tears before that
so<00:02:10.250> I<00:02:10.459> just<00:02:10.850> think<00:02:10.970> it<00:02:11.120> generally<00:02:11.510> have<00:02:11.660> a<00:02:11.690> good

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
so I just think it generally have a good

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.900 
so I just think it generally have a good
feel<00:02:12.200> themselves<00:02:12.560> because<00:02:13.100> we're<00:02:13.310> confidence

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
feel themselves because we're confidence

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.210 
feel themselves because we're confidence
control<00:02:14.300> experienced<00:02:14.780> success<00:02:14.930> with<00:02:15.740> see<00:02:16.010> up

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
control experienced success with see up

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.190 
control experienced success with see up
what's<00:02:16.490> in<00:02:16.610> your<00:02:16.880> strategy<00:02:17.120> is<00:02:17.570> to<00:02:17.600> put<00:02:17.959> Robert

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
what's in your strategy is to put Robert

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.750 
what's in your strategy is to put Robert
willing<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:18.680> do<00:02:18.890> to<00:02:18.950> enter<00:02:19.100> can<00:02:19.430> bring<00:02:19.640> it

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
willing to do to enter can bring it

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.550 
willing to do to enter can bring it
along<00:02:19.880> slowly

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
along slowly

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.870 
along slowly
there's<00:02:21.770> no<00:02:21.890> you<00:02:22.069> know<00:02:22.130> you<00:02:22.489> don't<00:02:22.670> want<00:02:22.819> to

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
there's no you know you don't want to

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.680 
there's no you know you don't want to
push<00:02:23.599> it

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
push it

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.320 
push it
three<00:02:24.960> a<00:02:24.990> great<00:02:25.380> mother<00:02:25.560> yeah<00:02:26.400> you<00:02:27.060> know<00:02:27.180> with

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
three a great mother yeah you know with

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.240 
three a great mother yeah you know with
Robert<00:02:27.720> will<00:02:27.840> definitely<00:02:28.230> move<00:02:28.350> very<00:02:28.560> slow<00:02:28.950> I

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
Robert will definitely move very slow I

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.880 
Robert will definitely move very slow I
think<00:02:30.150> we<00:02:30.240> know<00:02:30.390> a<00:02:30.420> lot<00:02:30.630> about<00:02:30.780> Robert<00:02:31.320> you

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
think we know a lot about Robert you

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.740 
think we know a lot about Robert you
know<00:02:31.920> who<00:02:32.220> he<00:02:32.370> is<00:02:32.400> know<00:02:32.850> how<00:02:33.120> he<00:02:33.180> is<00:02:33.270> the<00:02:33.360> player

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
know who he is know how he is the player

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.870 
know who he is know how he is the player
we<00:02:33.960> played<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.320> well<00:02:34.470> three<00:02:34.740> of<00:02:34.890> our<00:02:35.040> receiver

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
we played it well three of our receiver

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.210 
we played it well three of our receiver
spots<00:02:36.210> and<00:02:36.450> in<00:02:36.570> the<00:02:36.690> backfield<00:02:36.870> so<00:02:37.440> I<00:02:37.680> think

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
spots and in the backfield so I think

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.710 
spots and in the backfield so I think
it's<00:02:38.340> very<00:02:38.400> rare<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:38.790> have<00:02:39.060> only<00:02:39.240> had<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.510> guy

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
it's very rare to have only had a guy

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.690 
it's very rare to have only had a guy
really<00:02:39.930> for<00:02:40.260> a<00:02:40.290> year<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.560> half<00:02:40.620> basically<00:02:41.010> in

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
really for a year and half basically in

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.120 
really for a year and half basically in
him<00:02:42.210> to<00:02:42.390> have<00:02:42.480> done<00:02:42.630> so<00:02:42.870> much<00:02:43.050> so<00:02:43.320> probably

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
him to have done so much so probably

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.410 
him to have done so much so probably
more<00:02:44.250> than<00:02:44.310> he<00:02:44.490> went<00:02:44.640> out<00:02:44.730> on<00:02:45.090> our<00:02:45.120> team

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
more than he went out on our team

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.440 
more than he went out on our team
outside<00:02:45.810> it<00:02:45.960> may<00:02:46.080> be<00:02:46.140> mad<00:02:46.820> you<00:02:47.820> know<00:02:47.850> he<00:02:48.330> would

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
outside it may be mad you know he would

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.820 
outside it may be mad you know he would
need<00:02:48.600> to<00:02:48.750> be<00:02:48.840> out<00:02:48.870> there<00:02:49.020> so<00:02:49.380> we'll<00:02:49.500> go<00:02:49.620> very

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
need to be out there so we'll go very

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.380 
need to be out there so we'll go very
slow<00:02:50.100> with<00:02:50.250> him<00:02:50.400> I<00:02:50.700> actually<00:02:51.060> thought<00:02:51.330> he

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
slow with him I actually thought he

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.270 
slow with him I actually thought he
would<00:02:51.630> practice<00:02:52.080> today<00:02:52.230> kind<00:02:52.710> of<00:02:52.770> last<00:02:53.070> week

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
would practice today kind of last week

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.540 
would practice today kind of last week
kind<00:02:54.060> of

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
kind of

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.400 
kind of
we<00:02:54.610> set<00:02:55.270> back<00:02:55.450> a<00:02:55.480> little<00:02:55.720> bit<00:02:55.900> so<00:02:56.110> we're<00:02:56.260> just

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
we set back a little bit so we're just

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.780 
we set back a little bit so we're just
very<00:02:56.530> safe<00:02:56.860> probably<00:02:57.280> could<00:02:57.370> have<00:02:57.400> done<00:02:57.610> some

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
very safe probably could have done some

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.060 
very safe probably could have done some
stuff<00:02:58.000> today<00:02:58.180> did<00:02:59.170> you<00:02:59.290> get<00:02:59.470> a<00:02:59.500> sense<00:02:59.710> of<00:02:59.920> you

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
stuff today did you get a sense of you

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.380 
stuff today did you get a sense of you
get<00:03:00.190> a<00:03:00.220> sense<00:03:00.430> that<00:03:00.490> George's<00:03:00.970> really

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
get a sense that George's really

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.050 
get a sense that George's really
determined<00:03:01.870> to<00:03:01.990> prove<00:03:02.140> himself<00:03:02.320> here<00:03:03.220> I<00:03:03.460> do<00:03:03.700> I

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
determined to prove himself here I do I

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.880 
determined to prove himself here I do I
thought<00:03:04.510> that<00:03:04.570> George<00:03:04.960> was<00:03:05.080> very<00:03:05.320> confident

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
thought that George was very confident

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.520 
thought that George was very confident
that<00:03:06.100> he<00:03:06.790> he<00:03:07.150> looks<00:03:07.420> great<00:03:07.750> he<00:03:08.170> looks<00:03:08.350> healthy

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
that he he looks great he looks healthy

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.380 
that he he looks great he looks healthy
looks<00:03:08.950> strong<00:03:09.310> he's<00:03:09.520> going<00:03:09.820> after<00:03:09.970> the<00:03:10.210> ball

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
looks strong he's going after the ball

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.780 
looks strong he's going after the ball
and<00:03:10.690> I<00:03:11.170> think<00:03:11.350> that<00:03:11.440> comes<00:03:11.920> from<00:03:11.980> you<00:03:12.520> know<00:03:12.550> his

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
and I think that comes from you know his

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.600 
and I think that comes from you know his
confidence<00:03:13.330> a<00:03:13.510> lot<00:03:14.050> of<00:03:14.230> times<00:03:14.440> like<00:03:15.250> we<00:03:15.400> talked

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
confidence a lot of times like we talked

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.300 
confidence a lot of times like we talked
about<00:03:15.730> last<00:03:15.850> year<00:03:16.300> that's<00:03:16.600> the<00:03:16.870> norm<00:03:17.170> with<00:03:18.130> all

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
rarer situation which I quote every year

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.580 
rarer situation which I quote every year
there's<00:03:27.790> about<00:03:27.910> five<00:03:28.270> significant<00:03:29.200> impact

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
there's about five significant impact

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.370 
there's about five significant impact
true<00:03:29.800> freshman<00:03:30.280> around<00:03:30.460> the<00:03:30.550> country<00:03:30.910> and<00:03:31.380> so

true freshman around the country and so

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.080 
true freshman around the country and so
normally<00:03:33.250> they<00:03:33.370> take<00:03:33.580> a<00:03:33.610> little<00:03:33.700> bit<00:03:33.850> of<00:03:33.940> time

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
normally they take a little bit of time

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.730 
normally they take a little bit of time
to<00:03:34.270> adjust<00:03:34.360> like<00:03:34.810> George<00:03:35.080> especially<00:03:35.680> if

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740

good you didn't seem forcing the

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.520 
good you didn't seem forcing the
involves<00:03:58.580> no<00:03:58.730> I<00:03:58.970> thought<00:03:59.540> at<00:04:00.320> the<00:04:00.440> beginning

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
involves no I thought at the beginning

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.440 
involves no I thought at the beginning
last<00:04:00.890> fall<00:04:01.250> camp<00:04:01.520> he<00:04:01.670> got<00:04:01.790> a<00:04:01.820> little<00:04:01.970> bored<00:04:02.240> and

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
last fall camp he got a little bored and

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.610 
last fall camp he got a little bored and

feel those practices and we talked about

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.010

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 
yet some interceptions going and so it

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.390 
yet some interceptions going and so it
was<00:04:06.140> good<00:04:06.290> to<00:04:06.350> see<00:04:06.470> he<00:04:06.650> didn't<00:04:06.920> do<00:04:07.010> much<00:04:07.160> that

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.830 
was good to see he didn't do much that
day<00:04:07.580> what<00:04:08.060> about<00:04:08.150> the<00:04:08.270> other<00:04:08.360> quarterbacks

and

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.660 
and
I<00:04:16.530> think<00:04:16.769> they're<00:04:16.890> both<00:04:16.980> of<00:04:17.190> your<00:04:17.310> really<00:04:17.549> good

I think they're both of your really good
players<00:04:18.200> 20<00:04:19.200> burn<00:04:19.380> at<00:04:19.530> your<00:04:19.739> new<00:04:19.829> record

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.560 

as<00:04:22.500> you<00:04:22.680> write<00:04:22.830> them<00:04:23.040> today<00:04:23.270> yeah<00:04:24.270> I<00:04:24.300> thought<00:04:24.540> I

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
as you write them today yeah I thought I

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.690 
as you write them today yeah I thought I
thought<00:04:24.840> they<00:04:24.900> fit<00:04:25.170> in<00:04:25.290> really<00:04:25.500> well<00:04:25.700> they're

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
thought they fit in really well they're

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.270 
thought they fit in really well they're
very<00:04:26.880> comfortable<00:04:27.950> they're<00:04:28.950> really<00:04:29.160> good

teachers<00:04:29.670> in<00:04:29.820> their<00:04:29.910> confidence<00:04:30.420> so<00:04:30.600> I<00:04:30.630> think

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
teachers in their confidence so I think

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.480 
teachers in their confidence so I think
that<00:04:30.870> comes<00:04:31.200> out<00:04:31.410> and<00:04:31.920> we<00:04:32.100> spend<00:04:32.310> a<00:04:32.340> lot<00:04:32.370> of

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
that comes out and we spend a lot of

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:33.650 
that comes out and we spend a lot of
time<00:04:32.550> to<00:04:32.670> be<00:04:32.730> ready<00:04:32.820> for<00:04:33.060> this<00:04:33.300> day<00:04:33.510> in

time to be ready for this day in

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.390 
time to be ready for this day in

meetings and even walk through stuff but

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.370

confident<00:04:37.920> and<00:04:38.870> players<00:04:39.870> seem<00:04:40.140> to<00:04:40.170> really

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
confident and players seem to really

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.020
