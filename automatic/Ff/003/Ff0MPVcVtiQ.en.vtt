 in our today's review we 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:18.750
 We represent the smartphone company p &amp; g 525 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.340
 the smartphone has quite a classic 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.130
 design in hand 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.140

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.869
 average size by today's standards 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.970
 length 13 5 centimeters and width 6 s 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.199
 by half 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.790
 case material plastic on 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.270

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.040
 practically no finger marks 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:41.040
 here is a camera without flash or 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.350
 next to her speaker for removing the cover 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.480
 there is a small notch on the side 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.020
 squeaks of gaps and other unpleasant 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.970
 little things were noticed when opening 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.530
 covers see two slots for standard 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.990
 so -called mini-sim 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.730
 side is inserted micro sd card with 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:00.440
 which can help expand memory 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.440
 smartphone up to 32 gigabytes 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.090
 power and volume control 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.430
 located on the left side of the button 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.270
 enough relief of the grip of problems 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.580
 does not occur 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:16.890
 here is a micro usb jack for 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.900
 headphone top smartphone has ip forest 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.479
 4 and a half inch display 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.729
 960 by 540 resolution 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.310
 and is able to display up to 16 million 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.619
 Brightness colors are enough for 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.540
 outdoor use consider 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.340
 the pixels here are almost impossible that 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.560
 speaks of good meaning now 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.450
 quality pictures keep nice 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.340
 impressions can also be said about 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.840
 viewing angles are only slightly colored 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.970
 inverted when significant 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.340
 sensor deviation capacitive good 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.649
 reacts recognizes up to 5 touches 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.420
 at the same time the manufacturer refused 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:53.100
 virtual keys and so below 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.350
 display are three sense at g525 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.690
 there are two cameras frontal on 0 3 and 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.909
 main 5 megapixel with 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.770
 spot focus just touch 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.229
 to the screen in the right place and the camera will 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.030
 maximize 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.350
 The resolution for shooting video is 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.350
 640 by 480 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.130
 smartphone works on the base 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.989
 quad processor qualcomm s4 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.239
 with a frequency of 1 2 gigahertz 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.769
 has 1 gigabyte of ram not 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.720
 considering micro sd card support 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.880
 built-in flash memory in it four 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.400
 gigabyte thanks to graphic 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.780
 corner adreno 203 performance 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.970
 should be enough for most 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.980
 modern games are these polymer 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.079
 the battery has a capacity of 1700 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.760
 milliamps per hour is the day of active 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:37.410
 use but here you need to consider 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.750
 what is the normal average 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.750
 for most dual sim devices 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.560
 settings for using SIM cards 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.950
 looks like this here need 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.810
 choose 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.819
 set the main parameters for it 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.890
 smartphone one gsm module therefore 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.470
 call take down we'll hang cards 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:14.290
 at the same time will not work while 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:15.670
 1 2 is not active smartphone 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.459
 comes with an operating system 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.430
 android 4 1 and proprietary huawei shell 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:23.230
 emotion field than it is characteristic of 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.450
 first there is no usual for android 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.190
 device menu all shortcuts widgets 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.200
 placed on desktops 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.660
 they can be up to 9 at will 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.819
 user for lovers of prettiness 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.099
 Various transition effects are provided. 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:38.140
 between desktops pulling the screen 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:40.329
 above we get to the notification area 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.620
 here you can customize the necessary 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:46.299
 shortcuts for quick access to settings 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.099
 still worth mentioning profiles which 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:50.409
 different from our usual profiles 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:51.840
 The default sound is 4 but there is 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:54.370
 the ability to add your own 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.109
 the difference is that besides the volume of the sound 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.049
 here you can configure such parameters 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:00.910
 how to turn the screen brightness on and off 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.190
 wireless gps sensor and auto modules 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.109
 data synchronization 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.329
 g525 to possess all the attributes of good 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:09.220
 dual-sim smartphone is a great solution 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:11.049
 for those who are not chasing top 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.970
 devices but wants to have a device with 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:16.139
 good configuration and large display 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.139
 for reasonable deep
