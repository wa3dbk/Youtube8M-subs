 families and we used to find ourselves already 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.519
 I spoke yesterday at three o'clock in the afternoon 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.950
 last time because I had organized a 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.019
 dinner at home and the samu to tell me that 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.130
 He could not come because he was just leaving 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.140
 rosary to this wheat fair and that 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.189
 I was going to come back, it's just that today 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.320
 tomorrow the dawns the truth is that 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:28.590
 I keep the call that I have given 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.720
 67 minutes and where he filled with energy I 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.030
 He told some of his projects for this 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.870
 year that they had many was going to be 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:40.920
 besides radio television was I was 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.020
 super happy and with a desire to live 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.320
 and doing things and even this is 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.300
 question had not had the purpose of 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.980
 last year an offer for a 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.539
 candidacy in the city ​​of buenos aires 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.030
 on the part of sergio massa had 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.500
 analyzed had delayed him but he was 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.780
 eager to participate in 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.000
 policy not at this time maybe more 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.019
 forward but yes power 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.870
 offer in politics is a bit more than 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.470
 all that I knew and of which was so 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:13.800
 generous forming gustavo carabajal 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:16.470
 how is it and I imagine the impact that 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.540
 It must have been to learn about the 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.670
 good news as you found out the 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.520
 news and if we can remember a little 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.290
 to all those who are watching channel 26 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.470
 at this moment they wake up with 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.260
 this sad news of the death of a 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.229
 Young person was 50 years old from how 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:38.040
 it was this tragedy and how did you find out 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:41.280
 fernando voice I found out because I had a 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.490
 called this from a person who had 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.700
 seen in networks and he called me this well 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.759
 early 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.880
 at dawn so let's say that was 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.380
 the way I started to look at what there was 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.380
 I started looking at the networks that was where 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:01.250
 there were the first data 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:03.890
 I could not communicate with your 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.679
 wife really is with all the shock 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.599
 and the impact that is all this and with the 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:11.840
 paperwork saying for for May to 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:15.790
 the whole question of after the 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:19.010
 accident so let's say that was the 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.890
 way and the truth is that what you 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.319

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:27.250

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:41.440
