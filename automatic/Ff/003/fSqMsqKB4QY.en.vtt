can also use a lid if you have one I
don't<00:01:30.240> have<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.390> lid<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.689> fit<00:01:30.900> this<00:01:31.079> so<00:01:31.380> we<00:01:32.310> just

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
don't have a lid to fit this so we just

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.590 
don't have a lid to fit this so we just
seal<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.909> down<00:01:34.040> all<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.369> way<00:01:35.490> around<00:01:35.880> except

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
seal it down all the way around except

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.649 
seal it down all the way around except
for<00:01:37.369> maybe<00:01:38.369> an<00:01:38.610> inch<00:01:38.820> or<00:01:38.970> two<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.299> we<00:01:39.420> leave

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
for maybe an inch or two that we leave

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.899 
for maybe an inch or two that we leave
open<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:40.110> allows<00:01:40.350> us<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.979> steam<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.579> kind<00:01:41.880> of

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
open that allows us the steam to kind of

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.160 
open that allows us the steam to kind of
escape<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.659> then<00:01:42.920> get<00:01:43.920> crazy<00:01:44.220> on<00:01:44.399> us<00:01:45.140> so<00:01:46.140> I

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
escape so it then get crazy on us so I

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.719 
escape so it then get crazy on us so I
put<00:01:46.439> this<00:01:46.530> in<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.740> microwave<00:01:46.890> for<00:01:47.220> roughly

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
put this in the microwave for roughly

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:48.830 
put this in the microwave for roughly

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
seven minutes and then we're going to

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.870 
seven minutes and then we're going to
