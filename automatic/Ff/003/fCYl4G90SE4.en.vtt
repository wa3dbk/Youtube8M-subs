 I like this series a lot because 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:34.940
 good is to put in a structure where 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.920
 there are some precious materials and good 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.960
 there are many structures nearby and the 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.300
 strong hall that is closest to the 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.309
 space is very very thick and there is also 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.079
 a tension also very special but 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.820
 well all this we will see but 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.790

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:55.940
 world and we are going to hear a roll of 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:58.790
 homemade drums and natural ritz mc and 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:02.330

 yes gentlemen today there is no number we give to 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:09.619

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.130
 Ladies and gentlemen, let's see 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:17.479
 loading world by generating land and walking 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:20.390
 It can not be, I do not believe it, it can not be 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:25.240
 be yes gentlemen exposes masters in a 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:28.219
 desert pyramid that is around here 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.289
 we are in a meadow the truth is that 

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:33.079
 we are affected here we see that we are 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:35.060
 in plains very curious guys and good 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.950
 it's pretty good a shame because no 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.929
 there are diamonds but good if 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.549
 Diamonds would be fine as you see 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:43.070
 well there's just a bit of bone 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.530
 a little rotten meat and there's a 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.560
 valet book protection 3 if I do not 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.530
 I'm wrong very well and nothing worth it 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.939
 that there is no diamond so gentlemen this 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.220
 diamond trades to make us a 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:57.259
 tropic and good to move forward 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:02.209
 well, nothing here we have this pyramid 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:03.920
 of spawn that's pretty good and now 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:06.229
 we are going to go to a nation that is 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.140
 here next to spawn let's see for 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.780
 here we will see perfect very well 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.500
 it is a nation that is where it is 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:19.340
 in a forest that bordered on the 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:22.040
 desert and with the will and in this give 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.959

 we're going to equip it up here already 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:32.530

 golden apple, you guys know there's 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.100
 a super unlikely probability that 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.400
 appear a golden apple in new 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.510

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.920
 Well now, guys, we're going to go to 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.330
 desert is worth where the spam was but 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.940
 we are going to put a little more in the 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.730
 medium so we're going to go around here and 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:05.350

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.320
 desert structures another pyramid 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.300
 in which there is a little gold a 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.739
 little bone of rotten flesh a 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.190
 little metal a little bit of meat 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.690

 thank you very much and a little more than 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.370
 metal and light gold before this is 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.709
 everything really close is very close 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.700
 one thing from another and if we go around here 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.560
 back is worth 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.260
 I'm going to take the coordinates and I'm going to 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.970
 go there but you know we can 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.000
 catch by reference the pyramid 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.420
 we could come to this life the truth 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.540
 is that it is very very good because good 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:52.239
 infinite food carrots and potatoes 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.819
 that we would also use 48 bones that 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:57.340
 We carry and the bookstores because they are 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.410
 there and the other one was there then 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.970
 we have all the books we need 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.830
 that we also take two apples 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.260

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:08.560

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.000
 beak and a little better and obsidian 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.950
 some appliques that I'm not going to 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.590
 leave there not for the truth is that it is 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.959
 pretty well we could try 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.299
 get them in the bookstores to look 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.549
 there is one and here is the other and 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.830
 carrots and potatoes and those guys very 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.800

 in a stronghold and good the truth is 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.770
 that is pretty good how it has 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.620
 generated in the things already you have six 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.330
 apples in the same chest here starts 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:54.260
 to fall water then disappear 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:57.230
 bookstores float and guys yes yes yes 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:59.390
 we are in a strong soft if they follow a 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.880
 strong sad I'm saying we're in 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:04.040
 a strong sharp in a strong salt guys 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.440
 and well look around here we have a 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.600
 mansion is worth where we can catch here 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.180
 things because all this is all this 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.410
 of this and affinity to quadriga one for 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.330
 those people who want to do 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.610
 constructions under water because it will be 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:19.400
 very very well then nothing you know that 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.900
 all this is in the same walk and there 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.289
 there were probably remains of a trunk 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.629
 that has been generated from it 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:28.360
 and here also guys is all full of 

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:31.509
 broken trunks I love I love

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:36.399
 that you know that all this is a 

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:38.819
 very very very poorly generated extension and 

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:41.979
 As you can see, everything is full of good 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:45.689
 Degeneration deformities as you see 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:45.689
 good here 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:51.130

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.590
 of the software if you need it this 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.260
 king that if you wait for everything 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.160

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:10.470
 very much is this way 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:17.409
 and finally pick up a normal book 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:20.909
 all right 

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:20.909
 the soft sun pauer 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.740
 cabbage 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:31.630

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:33.690
 Y 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:33.690
