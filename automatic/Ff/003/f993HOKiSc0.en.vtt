I've been asked to talk about innocent
and<00:00:17.860> for<00:00:18.860> me<00:00:18.950> it's<00:00:19.070> quite<00:00:19.160> interesting<00:00:19.400> story

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:19.700 
and for me it's quite interesting story

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.550 
and for me it's quite interesting story
because<00:00:19.850> there's<00:00:20.029> been<00:00:20.150> there's<00:00:20.779> been<00:00:20.810> bits

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
because there's been there's been bits

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.920 
because there's been there's been bits
that<00:00:21.800> we've<00:00:21.980> got<00:00:22.160> so<00:00:22.430> right<00:00:22.730> and<00:00:23.119> have<00:00:23.540> gone<00:00:23.720> so

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
that we've got so right and have gone so

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.630 
that we've got so right and have gone so
well<00:00:24.140> in<00:00:24.320> those<00:00:24.410> bits<00:00:24.619> that<00:00:24.770> we<00:00:24.860> got<00:00:24.980> so<00:00:25.369> wrong

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
well in those bits that we got so wrong

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.020 
well in those bits that we got so wrong
and<00:00:26.560> we<00:00:27.560> nearly<00:00:27.710> lost<00:00:27.980> the<00:00:28.130> business<00:00:28.280> over<00:00:28.610> and

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:29.030 
and we nearly lost the business over and

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.430 
and we nearly lost the business over and
I<00:00:29.210> think<00:00:29.390> it's<00:00:29.510> the<00:00:29.630> latter<00:00:29.840> half<00:00:30.140> that<00:00:30.350> is

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:30.440 
I think it's the latter half that is

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.019 
I think it's the latter half that is
less<00:00:30.650> well<00:00:30.860> known<00:00:30.890> I<00:00:31.160> think<00:00:31.190> in<00:00:31.610> people<00:00:31.940> in

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
less well known I think in people in

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:33.580 
less well known I think in people in

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.310 
completely bonkers and the idea for
innocent<00:03:01.280> it<00:03:01.340> was<00:03:01.459> a<00:03:01.489> it<00:03:01.880> was<00:03:02.030> was<00:03:02.750> born<00:03:02.989> on<00:03:03.110> on

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
innocent it was a it was was born on on

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.160 
innocent it was a it was was born on on
on<00:03:04.310> that<00:03:04.579> ski<00:03:05.180> trip<00:03:05.209> and<00:03:05.570> so<00:03:05.750> we<00:03:05.840> came<00:03:05.930> back<00:03:06.079> the

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
on that ski trip and so we came back the

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.110 
on that ski trip and so we came back the
idea<00:03:06.350> of<00:03:06.410> setting<00:03:06.860> a<00:03:07.070> smoothie<00:03:07.489> company<00:03:07.820> and

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
idea of setting a smoothie company and

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.150 
idea of setting a smoothie company and

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
then spent evenings and weekends trying

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.580 
then spent evenings and weekends trying
out<00:03:10.280> smoothies<00:03:10.820> taking<00:03:11.750> them<00:03:11.870> in<00:03:11.959> the<00:03:12.350> next

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
out smoothies taking them in the next

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.250 
out smoothies taking them in the next
state<00:03:12.799> our<00:03:13.420> our<00:03:14.420> places<00:03:14.660> of<00:03:14.780> work<00:03:14.989> and<00:03:15.200> just

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
state our our places of work and just

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.509 
state our our places of work and just
getting<00:03:15.530> some<00:03:15.709> sort<00:03:15.860> of<00:03:15.920> research<00:03:16.190> together

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
getting some sort of research together

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:17.920 
getting some sort of research together
and<00:03:16.640> see<00:03:16.790> whether<00:03:17.000> it<00:03:17.450> was<00:03:17.540> something<00:03:17.780> that<00:03:17.810> we

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
and see whether it was something that we

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.240 
and see whether it was something that we
could<00:03:18.079> do<00:03:18.200> and<00:03:18.350> you<00:03:18.470> know<00:03:18.560> eventually<00:03:18.769> went

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
could do and you know eventually went

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.289 
could do and you know eventually went
about<00:03:19.400> setting<00:03:19.579> up<00:03:19.730> the<00:03:19.790> business<00:03:20.120> full-time

it's definitely been a sort of a it's
been<00:03:30.049> bigger<00:03:30.290> and<00:03:30.470> faster<00:03:30.620> than<00:03:30.920> we<00:03:31.190> ever

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
been bigger and faster than we ever

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.910 
been bigger and faster than we ever
could<00:03:31.519> have<00:03:31.730> hoped<00:03:32.000> but<00:03:32.500> as<00:03:33.500> I<00:03:33.620> said<00:03:33.709> there's

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
could have hoped but as I said there's

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.020 
could have hoped but as I said there's
been<00:03:33.950> the<00:03:34.130> stuff<00:03:34.280> that<00:03:34.430> we<00:03:34.489> got<00:03:34.579> right<00:03:34.760> there's

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
been the stuff that we got right there's

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.259 
been the stuff that we got right there's
the<00:03:35.090> stuff<00:03:35.540> that<00:03:35.660> we've<00:03:35.780> got<00:03:35.959> wrong<00:03:37.030> so<00:03:38.030> today

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
the stuff that we've got wrong so today

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:39.910 
the stuff that we've got wrong so today
I'm<00:03:38.480> going<00:03:38.870> to<00:03:38.959> talk<00:03:39.049> about<00:03:39.079> those<00:03:39.320> those<00:03:39.739> five

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
I'm going to talk about those those five

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.800 
I'm going to talk about those those five
things<00:03:41.290> for<00:03:42.290> me<00:03:42.410> I<00:03:43.250> think<00:03:43.970> if<00:03:44.450> I<00:03:44.540> could<00:03:44.600> only

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
things for me I think if I could only

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.780 
things for me I think if I could only
have<00:03:44.989> one<00:03:45.019> thing<00:03:45.410> it<00:03:45.620> would<00:03:46.070> be<00:03:46.220> it<00:03:46.489> would<00:03:46.640> be

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
have one thing it would be it would be

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.380 
have one thing it would be it would be
this<00:03:46.940> is<00:03:47.810> that<00:03:47.989> we<00:03:48.200> have<00:03:49.299> increasingly<00:03:50.299> come

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
this is that we have increasingly come

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.210 
this is that we have increasingly come
to<00:03:50.810> understand<00:03:51.290> what<00:03:51.530> is<00:03:51.620> a<00:03:51.650> fundamental

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
to understand what is a fundamental

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.479 
to understand what is a fundamental
truth<00:03:52.370> of<00:03:52.549> any<00:03:52.670> successful<00:03:53.150> person

absolutely<00:06:51.620> nothing<00:06:52.190> to<00:06:52.250> have<00:06:52.370> a<00:06:52.400> sentence
