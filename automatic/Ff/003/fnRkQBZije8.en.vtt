don't<00:00:39.960> ask<00:00:40.079> me<00:00:40.170> what<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.350> prize<00:00:40.649> is<00:00:40.680> because<00:00:41.070> I

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
don't ask me what the prize is because I

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.340 
don't ask me what the prize is because I
didn't<00:00:41.430> actually<00:00:41.550> read<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.149> but<00:00:42.390> this<00:00:42.989> got<00:00:43.230> me

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
didn't actually read it but this got me

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.290 
didn't actually read it but this got me
thinking<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.860> perhaps<00:00:44.640> there<00:00:44.910> might<00:00:45.059> be<00:00:45.120> an

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
thinking that perhaps there might be an

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.170 
thinking that perhaps there might be an
alternative<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:46.289> connect<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:47.520> we<00:00:47.700> could<00:00:47.879> use

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
alternative to connect that we could use

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.229 
alternative to connect that we could use
them<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.960> enhance<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.649> game<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.820> don't

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
them to enhance the game of it I don't

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.610 
them to enhance the game of it I don't
know<00:00:51.300> maybe<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:51.780> might<00:00:51.960> be<00:00:52.110> out<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.379> get

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
know maybe this might be out of a get

the<00:00:55.410> moment<00:00:55.590> i<00:00:55.920> am<00:00:56.100> using<00:00:56.489> an<00:00:56.670> alternative

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
the moment i am using an alternative

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.430 
the moment i am using an alternative
called<00:00:57.690> cams<00:00:58.260> face<00:00:59.239> cam<00:01:00.239> space<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.840> program

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
called cams face cam space is a program

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.149 
called cams face cam space is a program
where<00:01:02.149> monitors<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:03.329> tracks<00:01:03.660> an<00:01:04.080> object<00:01:04.890> of

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
where monitors and tracks an object of

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.190 
where monitors and tracks an object of
your<00:01:05.430> choice<00:01:05.939> depending<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.869> has<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.110> be

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
your choice depending it has to be

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.960 
your choice depending it has to be
fairly<00:01:07.590> bright<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.189> as<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.400> can<00:01:08.520> see<00:01:08.549> I've

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
fairly bright and as you can see I've

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.810 
fairly bright and as you can see I've
used<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.390> blue<00:01:09.630> sticker<00:01:10.080> on<00:01:10.920> top<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.490> black

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
used a blue sticker on top of a black

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.010 
used a blue sticker on top of a black
background<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.479> my<00:01:12.659> hat<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:14.810> that<00:01:15.810> worked

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
background on my hat so that worked

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.410 
background on my hat so that worked
quite<00:01:16.290> well<00:01:16.320> I<00:01:16.770> mean<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.220> have<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.820> rearrange

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
quite well I mean you have to rearrange

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.630 
quite well I mean you have to rearrange
myself<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.110> think<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.409> bigger<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.860> target<00:01:20.189> the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
myself I think the bigger the target the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.600 
myself I think the bigger the target the
easier<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.720> if<00:01:21.750> for<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.439> track<00:01:22.770> because<00:01:23.189> I

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
easier is if for it to track because I

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.789 
easier is if for it to track because I
had<00:01:23.850> trouble<00:01:24.090> with<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.390> dot<00:01:24.600> early<00:01:24.960> on<00:01:25.110> where

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
had trouble with the dot early on where

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.190 
had trouble with the dot early on where
it<00:01:25.890> kept<00:01:26.130> losing<00:01:26.509> as<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.659> can<00:01:27.780> see<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.020> just

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
it kept losing as you can see it just

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.740 
it kept losing as you can see it just
come<00:01:28.350> up<00:01:28.439> X<00:01:28.650> just<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.220> second<00:01:29.610> ago<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:30.119> that

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
come up X just a second ago and that

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.149 
come up X just a second ago and that
means<00:01:31.049> it's<00:01:31.200> stopped<00:01:31.470> Tracking's<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.070> that

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
means it's stopped Tracking's and that

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.520 
means it's stopped Tracking's and that
can<00:01:32.310> be<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.430> bit<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.759> problem<00:01:33.170> but<00:01:34.170> other<00:01:34.380> than

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
can be a bit of a problem but other than

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.399 
can be a bit of a problem but other than
that<00:01:37.189> you<00:01:38.189> have<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.430> play<00:01:38.610> around<00:01:38.729> with<00:01:39.030> the

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
that you have to play around with the

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.039 
that you have to play around with the
sensitivity<00:01:40.409> in<00:01:41.400> game<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.150> also<00:01:42.750> with<00:01:42.930> the

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
sensitivity in game and also with the

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.410 
sensitivity in game and also with the
program<00:01:43.320> itself<00:01:43.680> when<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.369> first<00:01:44.759> boot<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.270> up

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
program itself when I first boot it up

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.560 
program itself when I first boot it up
it<00:01:46.140> just<00:01:46.409> was<00:01:46.770> spinning<00:01:47.549> uncontrollably<00:01:47.729> I

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
it just was spinning uncontrollably I

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.859 
it just was spinning uncontrollably I
don't<00:01:48.840> know<00:01:48.899> what<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.170> was<00:01:49.320> doing<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:49.979> but<00:01:50.869> it

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
don't know what I was doing to it but it

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.660 
don't know what I was doing to it but it
just<00:01:51.899> wouldn't<00:01:52.170> stop<00:01:52.439> so<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:52.860> have<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.189> go<00:01:53.490> back

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
just wouldn't stop so I have to go back

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.010 
just wouldn't stop so I have to go back
to<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.880> drawing<00:01:54.090> board<00:01:54.270> i<00:01:54.540> think<00:01:54.720> i<00:01:54.780> put<00:01:54.960> the

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
to the drawing board i think i put the

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.569 
to the drawing board i think i put the
sensitivity<00:01:55.680> down<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:56.100> game<00:01:56.280> down<00:01:56.549> to

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
sensitivity down in game down to

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.569 
sensitivity down in game down to
ninety-two<00:01:57.420> percent<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:58.200> also<00:01:58.829> mr.<00:01:59.310> bout

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
ninety-two percent and also mr. bout

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:00.560 
ninety-two percent and also mr. bout
with<00:01:59.790> some<00:01:59.939> of<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.090> mouse<00:02:00.270> sensitivity

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
with some of the mouse sensitivity

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.770 
with some of the mouse sensitivity
options<00:02:01.640> the<00:02:02.640> program<00:02:03.030> itself<00:02:03.180> has<00:02:03.630> the

one for minecraft yet so I think this is
actually<00:03:25.880> a<00:03:25.910> first<00:03:26.440> but<00:03:27.440> someone<00:03:27.889> else<00:03:28.040> could

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
actually a first but someone else could

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.199 
actually a first but someone else could
have<00:03:28.280> done<00:03:28.310> it<00:03:28.430> just<00:03:28.669> haven't<00:03:28.910> done<00:03:28.940> a<00:03:29.030> video
