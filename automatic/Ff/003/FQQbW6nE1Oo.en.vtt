00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
robotics using vex robotics component

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.000 
robotics using vex robotics component
and<00:00:14.030> right<00:00:15.030> now<00:00:15.179> I'm<00:00:15.480> doing<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.379> elevator

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
and right now I'm doing the elevator

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.150 
and right now I'm doing the elevator
design<00:00:17.720> just<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.810> while<00:00:18.990> ago<00:00:19.020> I<00:00:19.500> made<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.800> program

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
design just a while ago I made a program

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.390 
design just a while ago I made a program
my<00:00:21.150> program<00:00:21.600> is<00:00:21.840> very<00:00:22.439> very<00:00:22.710> important<00:00:23.220> so

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
my program is very very important so

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.290 
my program is very very important so
that<00:00:23.699> my<00:00:24.050> vex<00:00:25.050> robotics<00:00:25.289> will<00:00:26.220> function<00:00:26.460> so<00:00:27.269> I

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
that my vex robotics will function so I

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.109 
that my vex robotics will function so I
used<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.720> robot<00:00:28.050> see<00:00:28.460> rabbit<00:00:29.460> see<00:00:29.640> from<00:00:29.970> the

I'm using on my elevator the touch

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.080 
I'm using on my elevator the touch
sensor<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.439> doesn't<00:01:07.920> sir<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:08.970> the

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
sensor is it doesn't sir and this is the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.820 
sensor is it doesn't sir and this is the
bumper<00:01:09.710> switch<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.189> this<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.830> distance

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
bumper switch and this is the distance

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.380

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
sensor that one and the bumper sensor

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.190 
sensor that one and the bumper sensor
once<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.439> press<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:25.830> one<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.369> will<00:01:26.810> it<00:01:27.810> will

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
once you press it one it will it will

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.730 
once you press it one it will it will
give<00:01:28.979> another<00:01:29.509> command<00:01:30.509> what<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.900> do<00:01:31.049> depends

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
give another command what to do depends

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.840 
give another command what to do depends
on<00:01:31.860> your<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:33.240> program<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.900> this<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.439> LED

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
on your the program and this is the LED

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.230 
on your the program and this is the LED
sensor<00:01:35.960> and<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:37.439> use<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.770> pulley<00:01:38.280> there's<00:01:39.119> a

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
sensor and I use a pulley there's a

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.700 
sensor and I use a pulley there's a
pulley<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:39.750> here<00:01:40.189> and<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:42.060> have<00:01:42.930> this<00:01:43.110> elevator

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
pulley in here and I have this elevator

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.420 
pulley in here and I have this elevator
so<00:01:44.840> this<00:01:45.840> old<00:01:46.049> structure<00:01:46.530> is<00:01:46.619> like<00:01:46.829> building

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
so this old structure is like building

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.550 
so this old structure is like building
this<00:01:48.210> support<00:01:49.170> in<00:01:49.979> which<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.970> elevator<00:01:51.270> can

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
this support in which the elevator can

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.969 
this support in which the elevator can
move<00:01:52.560> up<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:52.950> down<00:01:53.180> but<00:01:54.180> in<00:01:54.509> my<00:01:54.869> design<00:01:55.710> I'm

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
move up and down but in my design I'm

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.300 
move up and down but in my design I'm
going<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.250> show<00:01:56.399> you<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:57.090> basic<00:01:58.159> function<00:01:59.159> of

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
going to show you the basic function of

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.490 
going to show you the basic function of
our<00:01:59.579> elevator<00:01:59.969> so<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.689> use<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.049> pulleys

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
our elevator so I use the pulleys

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.469 
our elevator so I use the pulleys
instead<00:02:02.189> of<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.540> from<00:02:03.540> this<00:02:03.719> structure<00:02:04.399> and<00:02:05.479> the

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
instead of a from this structure and the

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.609 
instead of a from this structure and the
first<00:02:07.049> thing<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.380> do<00:02:07.590> today<00:02:08.580> is<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.360> switch<00:02:10.259> on

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
first thing to do today is to switch on

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.610 
first thing to do today is to switch on
the<00:02:10.920> LED<00:02:11.310> that's<00:02:12.270> already

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
the LED that's already

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.020 
the LED that's already
by<00:02:14.010> touching<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.300> then<00:02:16.200> these<00:02:17.030> this

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
by touching it and then these this

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.009 
by touching it and then these this
elevator<00:02:18.450> will<00:02:18.720> go<00:02:19.019> up<00:02:19.849> then<00:02:20.849> go<00:02:21.390> up<00:02:21.569> and<00:02:21.810> then

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
elevator will go up then go up and then

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.960 
elevator will go up then go up and then
until<00:02:22.680> it<00:02:22.950> touch<00:02:23.280> to<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:24.379> bumper<00:02:25.379> sensor<00:02:26.040> one

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
until it touch to the bumper sensor one

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.400 
until it touch to the bumper sensor one
it<00:02:27.239> turns<00:02:27.480> them<00:02:27.780> to<00:02:27.959> when<00:02:28.560> it<00:02:28.709> turn<00:02:28.980> into<00:02:29.129> one

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
it turns them to when it turn into one

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:39.710 
it turns them to when it turn into one
it<00:02:31.410> will<00:02:31.739> go<00:02:32.069> down<00:02:33.260> and<00:02:35.540> stop<00:02:36.540> once<00:02:37.519> it<00:02:38.720> reaches

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
it will go down and stop once it reaches

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.729 
it will go down and stop once it reaches
to<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.110> specified<00:02:41.180> distance<00:02:42.180> that<00:02:42.540> I<00:02:42.660> did<00:02:43.620> it

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
to the specified distance that I did it

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.470 
to the specified distance that I did it
made<00:02:43.920> my<00:02:44.190> problem<00:02:44.670> on<00:02:44.959> my<00:02:45.959> decent<00:02:46.829> sensor

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
made my problem on my decent sensor

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.789 
made my problem on my decent sensor
alright<00:02:48.480> so<00:02:49.319> we<00:02:49.470> have<00:02:49.620> to<00:02:49.860> do<00:02:50.250> it<00:02:50.400> how<00:02:51.090> it<00:02:51.269> works

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
alright so we have to do it how it works

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:57.229 
alright so we have to do it how it works
okay<00:02:52.799> just<00:02:53.160> put<00:02:53.489> it<00:02:53.610> properly<00:02:55.130> string<00:02:56.239> and

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
okay just put it properly string and

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:04.039 
okay just put it properly string and
then<00:02:59.750> turn<00:03:00.750> it<00:03:00.870> on<00:03:01.099> download<00:03:02.099> the<00:03:03.049> the
