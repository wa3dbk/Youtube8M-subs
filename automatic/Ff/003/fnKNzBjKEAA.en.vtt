because<00:03:55.409> in<00:03:55.709> team<00:03:55.860> deathmatch<00:03:56.060> you<00:03:57.060> can<00:03:57.180> run

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
because in team deathmatch you can run

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.750 
because in team deathmatch you can run
out<00:03:57.480> of<00:03:57.510> ammo<00:03:57.840> a<00:03:57.870> lot<00:03:58.140> but<00:03:58.620> in<00:03:58.739> search<00:03:58.980> I<00:03:59.370> can

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
put stingers almost as a secondary and

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.339 
put stingers almost as a secondary and
not<00:04:01.860> have<00:04:02.010> a<00:04:02.069> problem<00:04:02.400> with<00:04:02.519> it<00:04:02.900> because<00:04:03.900> I

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
not have a problem with it because I

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:07.339 
not have a problem with it because I
