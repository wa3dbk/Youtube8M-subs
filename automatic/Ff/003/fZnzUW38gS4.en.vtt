00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.519
 call or duty call or duty 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:15.050
 the finest warfare and we go for a moment 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:17.720
 ask what everyone thinks it 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.700

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.890

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.260
 newest call of duty trains considering what 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.869
 did you like it i normally never like that 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.400
 from cup tutti but I really liked that 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.340
 for example the cars in the grounds 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.650
 single people sat or new 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.480
 flying cars means 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.810
 flying cars making you 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.820
 also take from the traffic that ray what 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.290
 normally it stands still yes at least 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.079
 last time I check 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.790
 ok ok ok and that heal even more in the 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.399
 future t but what did you think of it 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.289
 I'm more of a second myself 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:52.280
 world war 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:53.510

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.710
 bit on waiting all got one 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.760
 new second world war there is already whole 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.079
 long ago 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.210
 yes because of that but then find it that way 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.190
 nice that for example thin comes 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.109
 think very interested in 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.760

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.400
 I will take a look at that 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.400
 header 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.990
 may I ask you something yes I already have you 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.540

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.540

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.100
 old-fashioned areas of what parents see 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.110
 I think I should see more of it 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.220
 before i can really say well this 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.780

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.480

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.510

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.649
 the two of us on his groin super busy 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.910

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.310
 new call or duty family trains 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.860

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.620
 I think he is sick why 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.990
 yes it is nicely done and what do you think 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.700
 of this theme and it is nice that it is that way 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.080
 Futuristic is 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.850
 saw you saw many references to 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.290
 star wars them to other things or day 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.310
 part of this fits very well with call 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.709
 or duty 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.690
 no I have already seen many references precisely 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.350
 yes I had that too but you 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.180
 in sense 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.620
 Think about what we are going to do this year 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.760
 ships or do you think would be better one 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.540
 World War II pussy thing can do 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.810
 or something 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.750
 no i think he is sick cell thank you 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.880
 tanks this way this way that is 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.739
 just fucking every day here you have too 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.810
 the cult juliet wish he becomes the trailer 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.970
 seen i assume yes in date just 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.920
 seen and what is your opinion about it 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.290
 it was a lot of action action action 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.530
 action again that's cool on julia that is 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.660
 lucinda chose it but that yes what 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.190
 for may black out that something 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.320
 calmer and that it is different 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.120
 moment the filling was nice and it would 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.730
 even though I am going to see you and I will find a name 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.050
 just it's not good or coast 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.940
 bad the game i leave in the middle size 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.600
 the name is catching blackops too 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.630
 interesting 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.310
 the friends warfare yes it sounds like 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.980
 an expansion pack such journalist 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.320
 website so no it's true you 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.430
 you want to finish well thank you 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.430
 no i think bad website 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.469
 I want grandma no but yes it is less 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.569
 catchy then say a call of duty 

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:40.069
 ghost or blackops and that name 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.750
 I don't know if that really is the working title 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.549
 or the final names that this is 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.650
 I think the final title is whole 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.900
 that can be better than I think and for the 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.069
 rest yes you know if you really only 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.109
 action well then you are also good 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.370
 call of duty or now infiniti word or 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:54.829
 Treyarch is the market that makes up in itself 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.109
 nothing matter or sledgehammer in this case 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:58.849
 or sledgehammer indeed but I think 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:00.709
 I don't think they line up a bit 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:01.819
 continue if, however, want different and that 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.920
 will ultimately prove that the 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:06.919
 must then that comes after a number of years 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.870
 we'll see yes boys are allowed indeed 

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:10.370
 I disturb you 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.629
 did you just call it juliet 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.439
 wish he is seen the trailer 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:16.160
 yes don't pay attention if you are not your 

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:17.479
 game 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.180
 well i always like it though 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:23.240
 asked for those things no more 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.949
 mbo mbo good game play a lot of call or 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.349

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:30.169
 neo now more for you from the trailer 

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:32.000
 i saw kevin spacey and i look at house 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:34.460
 or cards it is therefore nice it is 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.500
 only nicer is kevin spacey 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.419
 sit and sit in it and he carried on 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.580
 house of cards is that we are 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:43.460
 reason for you to find this no 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.849
 no no no not for my life 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.370

 same shipping game 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:58.010
 my opinion yes but nicer than 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:59.150
 the previous 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.419
 very honest and if not such a difficult one 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:05.120

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.810
 computer that was actually my next 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.669

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:22.310
 two months of work already stopped 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:24.289
 say fifa but we where come from 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.860
 eindhoven where thought to come by day 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:27.080
 were ready 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:30.050
 they did was too much information 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:33.009
 man yes but still a lot of fun 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.009
 the rest of the day ah yes 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:40.010
 may may disturb you during 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:41.930
 coaster yes I will fuck your killstreak 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.490
 did you just have the goal to the 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.760
 seen an advanced warfighter trailer 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:48.830
 yes what shower thoughts about it 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.860
 Well that it was especially bad as 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:55.280
 especially with your call or duty 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:57.440
 especially with the one I had with all 

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:00.290
 long shots in particular 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:03.080
 but base it mainly on precise 

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.970
 especially use what kind of weapons did you see 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.690
 than on the very large can 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:12.440
 I do yes and that makes a difference 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:14.240
 more difficult also how I am kemp weapons here 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:17.420
 we at TMF often together and then know 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:20.210
 that very much you have the wish wolf 

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:26.270
 rider trail also seen yes what for the 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:27.830
 cool that you are autistic here too much 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.960
 struggling to turn around 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:33.200
 but well yes you thought it was cool and from him 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.840
 go through you really do not want to die hey really 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:38.390
 too much trouble to turn around 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:39.290
 Well yes your face have just seen 

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:42.040
 but it's good that you keep looking 

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:42.040
 to your want screen
