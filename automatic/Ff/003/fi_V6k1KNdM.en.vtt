00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.320
 I have here for the boys how are you waiting 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.000
 and I'm fine before I start I want 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.430
 that this video reaches a goal of 100 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.950
 I'm sure that if it came guys 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.259
 because because this video will be worth it 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.719
 and then nothing guys today I bring 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:31.390
 theories of the minecraft pocket edition of 

00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:33.520
 the 0.12 point 1 because we are already in the 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.250
 last betas and this means that 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.649
 more mana is approaching the 0.12 point 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.480
 a more or less official in two weeks and 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:42.700
 we will have this great version and how 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.650
 we can see already this version or you are 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.810
 buils no longer have so many ships so 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.510
 exaggeratedly and now another week more 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:52.150
 more so that the game is updated for 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.010
 This means that it will contribute 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.840
 approximately to validate the 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.910
 game we'll see later on when 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.560
 take or share with us the capture of 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.680
 screen that already launched the 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.940
 0.12 point 1 for ios and we would play 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.189
 wait for the version of the 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.500
 minecraft pocket edition is valid for 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:11.259
 Apple many wonder will come out first 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.329
 for android as the 0.11 point zero 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.520
 boys tommaso decided to throw at the same 

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:17.680
 time the official version for all types 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.630
 of operating systems the answer is 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.299
 what if maybe ios android 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.610
 the 10 leave at the same time or the same 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:27.039
 day there are rumors that they will be added to 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.049
 the rabbits all this are theories and then 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:31.149
