00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 cadena3 the most open television in a 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.480
 body and we talked a little about this 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.680
 matter there are some young players 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.080
 what can you have been 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.809
 summoned others not so much I would have 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.120
 liked to see jurgen give for example that 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.699
 He is a very fast man who does not know him 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.100
 that can work is certainly very 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.900
 young but out there suddenly some 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.670
 players that I like I think that the 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.010
 weaker party unless all led 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.380
 fat in the defense even with the so-called 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.240
 of rafa marquez that rafa marquez because 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.430
 we all know that you are having a 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.590
 good dry season is schoolgirl verona 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.660
 but then it definitely takes it to 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.430
 be the man who put the order there 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.890
 in defense so Rafa had said 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.870
 that wanted to play this tournament that 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.250
 it seemed interesting to him and then yes 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.600
 I think in the midfield where is what 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.820
 strongest of the Mexican team in 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.410
 defense some doubts forward and 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.539
 we hear action will solve it there is no 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.860
 a lot of goals with these players calls me 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.270
 attention in the call for 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.489
 vicente matías vuoso because I think that 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.690
 the tournament started very well and it fell 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.520
 that other players could have 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.500
 worried about that place especially with 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.670
 the experience possibly someone is going to 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.140
 say I'm crazy but up until 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.280
 nigris I think that coming is already a 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.120
 tested player that when he has put 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.950
 to the beach of the selection 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.210
 to heavy I know that bozzo did not have is very 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.340
 important on some occasion with the 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.840
 selection back in edmonton in canada 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.610
 but already if a 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.950
 veteran forward like you or I think 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.360
 that someone in better shape as well 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.310
 Alvarez could have helped a little more 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.260
 this equipment and then if it looks like a box 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.150
 somewhat unbalanced in some 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.470
 many young aspects for block I think 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.330
 that could have entered very well this 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.890
 call will have to be with the 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.330
 sub-22 of ron gutiérrez then not 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.090
 can be summoned as raúl lópez 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.520
 for example this young side very vain 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.920
 how to go and not healthy also then good 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.270
 Well, I think the reality that he faced 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.650
 miguel herrera although he teeth for 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.200
 it was said that mexico over them 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.760
 talent because reality is another slope 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.120
 work for young new channels 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.120
 so 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.380
 Well, it will be difficult, it will be difficult 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.570
 because one thinks bolivia can be 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.430
 winning chile is not the maximum power and 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.110
 south america ecuador neither but mexico 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.730
 does not go either with your best selection and 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.140
 Ecuador, Chile and Bolivia were with their 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.850
 best hits you know can not be a 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.710
 test ball let's see what players 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.750
 grows in this tournament and to be 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.819
 considered for the so-called selection 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.920
 big to the future that 's right but what 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.810
 that's going to work and believe me 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.030
 I consider your only opinion better than 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.980
 manage to advance to the next round and 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.999
 it would be a triumph especially taking in 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.319
 pablo account that on the last occasion 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:24.749
 that was an alternative team 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.999
 represent us the long america those of 

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:28.379
 the 2 round but the young rumberos 

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:30.239
 many of them that did not even arrive 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.590
 because of the theme of the fiesta mexico failed 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.180
 flat out and I think that Mexico is not 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.859
 for papelon in the cup america mexico 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.840
 had left a high standard in his 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:38.969
 participation and the previous one was a flavor 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.260
 bitter the one that let us hope that in 

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:43.819
 this occasion that we now prepare 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.530
 from agreement with me and concacaf 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.060
 to give a little space between one 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.230
 and others because it would be interesting because 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.340
 I think the American Cup itself 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.209
 will wear much more wear to the best 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.749
 Clear Mexican selection are just things 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.749
