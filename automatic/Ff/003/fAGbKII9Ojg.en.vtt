00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:04.660
 In the same issue 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.660
 It is called two rulers 

00:00:08.819 --> 00:00:10.119
 1052 

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:13.119
 This wireless keyboard 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:17.459
 In such a movement 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.460
 Let's request 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.210
 Publicity free of charge 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.159
 At the time of crime 

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:32.159
 Exhaust it 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.580
 Starting from operation this day 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.580
 Headed over by Okamura Butut 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.610
 Equally received on 6 days 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.040
 For two devices 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.440
 The same port mind is usually going once 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.350
 I think you know these two but it's not 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.020
 From the state of the city 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.340
 See now 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.280
 We will work on in the future 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.890
 Take care 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:06.880
 Asahara 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.160
 I have to buy 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.160
 In the rough 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.110
 Protecting borrowers 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.110
 2 2 8 km 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.120
 with this 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.100
 I will do a little 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.100
 I made an action on the Ajimitsu Path 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.100
 We are together 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.050
 I think it's a topic 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.320
 Operate as many as three or as many 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.860
 It is next to the state that can be left unfinished 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:53.980
 in Japan 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:54.990
 Finally 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.370
 15 items are good
