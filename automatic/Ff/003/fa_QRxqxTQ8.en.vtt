00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 very good friends welcome to a new 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.629
 video today I bring you new 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.150
 super dragon ball information and this 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.099
 time is something very novel I had thought 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.080
 bring them a naruto top but it came up 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.839
 this information and here I bring them 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.060
 as well I said it's dragon ball super and 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.250
 in this the information is that dragon 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.769
 Super ball will arrive as a brand but without 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.680
 Akira Toriyama without having arrived yet 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.720
 in the middle of 2015 is already the best 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.570
 season for dragon gold fans 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.279
 at least in the last two decades not 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.219
 only his latest movie was released 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.899
 dragon ball z fu cats 1f but it 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.329
 announced the arrival of a new saga 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.980
 animated titled dragon ball super la 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.070
 which now also confirms a 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.350
 printed adaptation toriyama detaches 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.570
 of the dragon ball mark super if well 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.879
 it's not something new to have brands based 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.190
 in anime and even less that they run at the same 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.039
 time yes it is quite remarkable to throw 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.170
 two series debutantes although it is worth saying 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.210
 that does not seem far-fetched since 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.130
 it is one of the most anime series 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.470
 famous and successful of recent years 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.150
 but what makes it even more interesting 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.890
 is that it will not be akira toriyama the 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:11.290
 In charge of carrying forward both 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.320
 projects but that said brand will be work 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.210
 of toyota of this excellent artist is 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.550
 one of the considered successors of 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.350
 toriyama if we consider your style 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.600
 and the age of the creator of dragon ball z 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.580
 he already has his resume with 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.440
 several works related to the 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.240
 franchise like dragon ball heroes 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.460
 Victor and mission or the adaptation itself 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.240
 brand of the movie dragon ball z fu 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.010
 cats 1 efe a series of three chapters 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.720
 this is not so bad since the successor of 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.850
 Akira Toriyama in several interviews 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.160
 he named the characteristic and very well 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.930
 Achieved work of Akira Toriyama he already 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.180
 had said that he was not to create 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.460
 new sagas and create a manga and a saga 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.410
 at the same time it is more complicated still 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.090
 age he takes so he 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.130
 will create the saga and the 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.990
 upcoming movies and toyota what's 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.420
 perform the manga based on what akira 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.670
 toriyama say is not a very information 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.950
 great but it arose quite a few hours ago 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.110
