00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
camera of the bunch I think and it's

pretty<00:00:47.350> evident<00:00:47.590> it<00:00:47.920> gets<00:00:48.100> pretty<00:00:48.309> grainy

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
pretty evident it gets pretty grainy

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
although on the good side you can't see

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.040 
although on the good side you can't see
too<00:00:50.920> many<00:00:51.040> pores<00:00:51.430> not<00:00:51.969> too<00:00:52.390> much<00:00:52.570> detail

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:34.359 
better on the iPhone 6 plus because you

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:36.690 
better on the iPhone 6 plus because you
have<00:01:34.509> less<00:01:34.990> of<00:01:35.169> a<00:01:35.289> blown<00:01:35.560> out<00:01:35.799> background

exposing<00:01:42.459> my<00:01:42.819> face<00:01:43.209> correctly<00:01:43.919> now<00:01:44.919> taking<00:01:45.310> a

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
exposing my face correctly now taking a

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.519 
exposing my face correctly now taking a
look<00:01:45.520> at<00:01:45.609> the<00:01:45.700> samsung<00:01:46.090> galaxy<00:01:46.119> s6<00:01:47.020> edge<00:01:47.319> and

00:01:47.519 --> 00:01:47.529 
look at the samsung galaxy s6 edge and

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:50.039 
look at the samsung galaxy s6 edge and
that<00:01:48.130> has<00:01:48.279> a<00:01:48.310> really<00:01:48.669> well<00:01:49.060> exposed<00:01:49.479> shot<00:01:49.779> over

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
that has a really well exposed shot over

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:52.589 
that has a really well exposed shot over
the<00:01:50.139> whole<00:01:50.319> thing<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:51.159> picture<00:01:51.759> pretty<00:01:52.239> sharp

00:01:52.589 --> 00:01:52.599 
the whole thing the picture pretty sharp

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:55.889 
the whole thing the picture pretty sharp
actually<00:01:53.109> I<00:01:53.289> look<00:01:53.979> nice<00:01:54.759> and<00:01:54.999> tan<00:01:55.060> as<00:01:55.419> well<00:01:55.450> I'm

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
actually I look nice and tan as well I'm

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:58.379 
actually I look nice and tan as well I'm
probably<00:01:56.139> not<00:01:56.560> that<00:01:56.709> turned<00:01:57.009> but<00:01:57.279> you<00:01:57.939> can<00:01:58.119> see

00:01:58.379 --> 00:01:58.389 
probably not that turned but you can see

00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:01.830 
probably not that turned but you can see
some<00:01:58.749> pause<00:01:59.469> appearing<00:02:00.189> not<00:02:01.149> so<00:02:01.419> flattering

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
some pause appearing not so flattering

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.359 
some pause appearing not so flattering
but<00:02:01.989> it<00:02:02.109> does<00:02:02.289> bode<00:02:02.499> well<00:02:02.529> in<00:02:02.859> terms<00:02:03.069> of

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
but it does bode well in terms of

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.639 
but it does bode well in terms of
accuracy<00:02:03.729> and<00:02:04.119> sharpness<00:02:04.509> my<00:02:05.169> beard<00:02:05.409> looks

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
accuracy and sharpness my beard looks

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:07.409 
accuracy and sharpness my beard looks
pretty<00:02:05.889> scruffy<00:02:06.279> you<00:02:06.489> can<00:02:06.700> see<00:02:06.909> individual

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:07.419 
pretty scruffy you can see individual

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:10.199 
pretty scruffy you can see individual
has<00:02:07.630> pretty<00:02:08.289> good<00:02:08.380> going<00:02:08.679> and<00:02:08.979> it<00:02:09.250> looks<00:02:10.000> like

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
has pretty good going and it looks like

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:11.670 
has pretty good going and it looks like
there's<00:02:10.450> almost<00:02:10.599> been<00:02:10.869> a<00:02:10.899> beauty<00:02:11.319> filter

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
there's almost been a beauty filter

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.430 
there's almost been a beauty filter
applied<00:02:11.980> to<00:02:12.159> it<00:02:12.310> I

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
applied to it I

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.920 
applied to it I
seht<00:02:13.710> beauty<00:02:14.070> mode<00:02:14.250> 2-0<00:02:14.670> so<00:02:15.060> I'd<00:02:15.450> say<00:02:15.690> the

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
seht beauty mode 2-0 so I'd say the

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.440 
seht beauty mode 2-0 so I'd say the
Samsung<00:02:16.320> Galaxy<00:02:16.440> s6<00:02:17.250> edge<00:02:17.520> probably<00:02:17.970> takes

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
Samsung Galaxy s6 edge probably takes

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.740 
Samsung Galaxy s6 edge probably takes
the<00:02:18.720> most<00:02:18.840> flattering<00:02:19.610> pictures<00:02:20.610> while<00:02:21.450> still

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
the most flattering pictures while still

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.870 
the most flattering pictures while still
retaining<00:02:21.930> a<00:02:22.470> really<00:02:22.980> good<00:02:23.220> amount<00:02:23.550> of<00:02:23.700> detail

closest I can get on the iPhone yeah the

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.230 
closest I can get on the iPhone yeah the
samsung<00:02:40.650> galaxy<00:02:41.010> s6<00:02:41.220> edge<00:02:41.460> looks<00:02:41.760> really<00:02:42.090> nice

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
samsung galaxy s6 edge looks really nice

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.980 
samsung galaxy s6 edge looks really nice
and<00:02:42.770> detailed<00:02:43.910> probably<00:02:44.910> not<00:02:45.090> quite<00:02:45.300> as<00:02:45.510> crisp

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
and detailed probably not quite as crisp

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.280 
and detailed probably not quite as crisp
on<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.260> eyes<00:02:46.530> as<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:47.550> z3<00:02:48.390> plus<00:02:48.750> but

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
on the eyes as the z3 plus but

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.380 
on the eyes as the z3 plus but
definitely<00:02:49.770> more<00:02:49.920> so<00:02:50.190> than<00:02:50.460> the<00:02:50.610> iPhone<00:02:51.030> now

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
definitely more so than the iPhone now

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.570 
definitely more so than the iPhone now
we<00:02:51.450> can<00:02:51.690> take<00:02:51.900> a<00:02:51.930> look<00:02:52.080> at<00:02:52.230> the<00:02:52.320> g4<00:02:52.770> the<00:02:52.890> LG<00:02:53.220> g4

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
we can take a look at the g4 the LG g4

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.070 
we can take a look at the g4 the LG g4
interestingly<00:02:53.910> flipped<00:02:54.600> me<00:02:54.780> I<00:02:54.840> haven't

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
interestingly flipped me I haven't

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.930 
interestingly flipped me I haven't
tweaked<00:02:55.440> any<00:02:55.680> settings<00:02:56.340> so<00:02:56.580> this<00:02:56.760> is<00:02:56.910> a

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
tweaked any settings so this is a

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.320 
tweaked any settings so this is a
factory<00:02:57.870> settings<00:02:58.320> for<00:02:58.560> selfies<00:02:59.010> and<00:02:59.790> yeah

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
factory settings for selfies and yeah

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.960 
factory settings for selfies and yeah
it's<00:03:00.510> flipped<00:03:00.840> my<00:03:01.050> face<00:03:01.530> round<00:03:01.830> still<00:03:02.490> with

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
it's flipped my face round still with

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.210 
it's flipped my face round still with
that<00:03:03.390> in<00:03:03.570> mind<00:03:03.750> you<00:03:03.930> do<00:03:04.020> get<00:03:04.230> very<00:03:04.500> sharp<00:03:05.070> it

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
that in mind you do get very sharp it

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.820 
that in mind you do get very sharp it
looks<00:03:05.370> almost<00:03:05.550> over<00:03:06.030> shopping<00:03:06.830> results

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
looks almost over shopping results

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.460 
looks almost over shopping results
probably<00:03:08.660> amongst<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:09.750> sharpest<00:03:10.200> you<00:03:10.320> can

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
probably amongst the sharpest you can

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.160 
probably amongst the sharpest you can
see<00:03:10.650> more<00:03:10.800> pause<00:03:11.100> but<00:03:11.460> exposure<00:03:12.120> it<00:03:12.600> has<00:03:12.870> half

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
see more pause but exposure it has half

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.830 
see more pause but exposure it has half
my<00:03:13.380> face<00:03:13.560> slightly<00:03:14.100> more<00:03:14.910> exposed<00:03:15.330> and<00:03:15.690> the

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
my face slightly more exposed and the

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.620 
my face slightly more exposed and the
other<00:03:15.990> quite<00:03:16.410> dark<00:03:16.920> so<00:03:17.220> maybe<00:03:17.940> didn't<00:03:18.300> pay<00:03:18.480> as

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
other quite dark so maybe didn't pay as

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.810 
other quite dark so maybe didn't pay as
much<00:03:18.780> attention<00:03:18.840> to<00:03:19.470> exposing<00:03:20.220> my<00:03:20.520> face

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
much attention to exposing my face

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.600 
much attention to exposing my face
correctly<00:03:21.510> as<00:03:21.660> the<00:03:22.230> others<00:03:22.590> but<00:03:22.800> again

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
correctly as the others but again

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.820 
correctly as the others but again
zooming<00:03:24.450> right<00:03:24.480> in<00:03:24.840> on<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.080> eyes<00:03:25.230> I<00:03:25.260> can<00:03:25.680> get

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
zooming right in on the eyes I can get

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.290 
zooming right in on the eyes I can get
very<00:03:26.100> very<00:03:26.190> close<00:03:26.580> because<00:03:26.820> it<00:03:27.000> has<00:03:27.120> got<00:03:27.270> a

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
very very close because it has got a

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.060 
very very close because it has got a
very<00:03:27.510> high<00:03:27.600> resolution<00:03:27.870> 8<00:03:28.410> megapixel

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
very high resolution 8 megapixel

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.760 
very high resolution 8 megapixel
front-facing<00:03:29.820> camera<00:03:30.690> and<00:03:30.900> indeed<00:03:31.350> my<00:03:31.590> eyes

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
front-facing camera and indeed my eyes

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.930 
front-facing camera and indeed my eyes
do<00:03:32.340> look<00:03:32.700> pretty<00:03:33.540> sharp<00:03:34.230> sharper<00:03:35.190> than<00:03:35.520> the

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
do look pretty sharp sharper than the

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.510 
do look pretty sharp sharper than the
rest<00:03:36.180> actually<00:03:36.660> so<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:36.930> LG<00:03:37.260> g4<00:03:37.680> may<00:03:38.160> win<00:03:38.370> in

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
rest actually so the LG g4 may win in

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.340

even if it wasn't the highest resolution
out<00:04:01.650> there<00:04:02.010> so<00:04:02.459> we<00:04:02.940> can<00:04:02.970> zoom<00:04:03.540> back<00:04:03.570> out<00:04:04.050> and<00:04:04.110> we

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
out there so we can zoom back out and we

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.870 
out there so we can zoom back out and we

can take a look at how it copes with

the Sony Xperia 3 plus it exposes a face

the Sony Xperia 3 plus it exposes a face

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:17.780 
every time that means a face detection

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.780 
every time that means a face detection
is<00:06:18.080> going<00:06:18.260> to<00:06:18.320> be<00:06:18.440> the<00:06:18.560> real<00:06:18.770> focus<00:06:19.190> here<00:06:19.610> and

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:19.790 
is going to be the real focus here and

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.660 
is going to be the real focus here and
that's<00:06:20.390> not<00:06:20.660> a<00:06:20.720> bad<00:06:21.020> thing<00:06:21.080> at<00:06:21.950> all<00:06:22.010> and<00:06:22.490> it

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:22.670 
that's not a bad thing at all and it

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.180 
that's not a bad thing at all and it
does<00:06:22.970> produce<00:06:23.210> a<00:06:23.570> pretty<00:06:24.170> decent<00:06:24.680> shot<00:06:24.920> and

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:25.190 
does produce a pretty decent shot and

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:26.170 
does produce a pretty decent shot and
we're<00:06:25.430> guessing<00:06:25.610> it<00:06:25.880> would<00:06:26.000> be<00:06:26.150> a

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:26.180 
we're guessing it would be a

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.430 
we're guessing it would be a
significantly<00:06:26.870> better<00:06:27.050> than<00:06:27.320> its

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:27.440 
significantly better than its

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.800 
significantly better than its
predecessor<00:06:27.500> I<00:06:28.310> wouldn't<00:06:29.270> say<00:06:29.450> it's<00:06:29.660> my

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:29.810 
predecessor I wouldn't say it's my

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:30.390 
predecessor I wouldn't say it's my
favorite

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 
favorite

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.640

the<00:06:30.550> bunch<00:06:30.820> I'd<00:06:31.449> say<00:06:31.660> my<00:06:31.810> favorite<00:06:31.840> would

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:32.650 
the bunch I'd say my favorite would

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:34.830 
the bunch I'd say my favorite would
probably<00:06:33.010> go<00:06:33.220> to<00:06:33.280> the<00:06:33.430> Samsung<00:06:34.120> Galaxy<00:06:34.510> s6

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:34.840 
probably go to the Samsung Galaxy s6

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.590 
probably go to the Samsung Galaxy s6
edge<00:06:35.050> and<00:06:35.949> the<00:06:36.340> iPhone<00:06:36.729> six-plus<00:06:37.240> would<00:06:37.479> be

edge and the iPhone six-plus would be

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.450 
edge and the iPhone six-plus would be
joint<00:06:37.960> winners<00:06:38.350> on<00:06:38.560> that<00:06:38.770> selfie<00:06:39.190> sticks

joint winners on that selfie sticks

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.640 
joint winners on that selfie sticks
because<00:06:39.639> they<00:06:40.180> balance<00:06:40.570> the<00:06:40.780> front<00:06:41.020> and<00:06:41.229> back

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:41.650 
because they balance the front and back

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:43.560 
because they balance the front and back
and<00:06:41.889> also<00:06:42.250> if<00:06:42.550> you're<00:06:42.760> taking<00:06:43.060> the<00:06:43.180> group<00:06:43.330> shot
