down<00:01:21.990> so<00:01:22.439> we're<00:01:22.650> going<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.280> do<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.540> baseline

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
down so we're going to do a baseline

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.530 
down so we're going to do a baseline
bumping<00:01:26.490> around<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.909> then<00:01:27.060> back<00:01:27.240> up<00:01:27.450> the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
bumping around and then back up the

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.480 
bumping around and then back up the
coverage<00:01:27.930> all<00:01:28.170> this<00:01:28.619> does<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:28.890> just<00:01:29.220> get<00:01:29.369> off

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
coverage all this does is just get off

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.280 
coverage all this does is just get off
on<00:01:29.670> seven<00:01:29.970> where<00:01:30.090> we<00:01:30.210> want<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.509> we're<00:01:30.930> backing

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
on seven where we want it we're backing

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.710 
on seven where we want it we're backing
up<00:01:31.380> our<00:01:31.500> coverage<00:01:31.770> as<00:01:32.040> far<00:01:32.250> as<00:01:32.340> we<00:01:32.460> can<00:01:32.720> we're

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
up our coverage as far as we can we're

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.600 
up our coverage as far as we can we're
in<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> global<00:01:33.990> blinks<00:01:34.500> everybody<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.340> then

in a global blinks everybody and then

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.950 
in a global blinks everybody and then
what<00:01:35.759> we're<00:01:35.880> going<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.090> do<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.420> we're<00:01:36.659> going<00:01:36.869> to

what we're going to do is we're going to

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.660 
what we're going to do is we're going to
contain<00:01:37.549> deep<00:01:38.549> zone<00:01:38.869> contain<00:01:40.250> but<00:01:41.250> this<00:01:41.430> does

contain deep zone contain but this does

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.770 
contain deep zone contain but this does
is<00:01:41.909> it's<00:01:42.180> going<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.509> allow<00:01:42.750> us<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.430> place<00:01:44.780> the

is it's going to allow us to place the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.990 
is it's going to allow us to place the
