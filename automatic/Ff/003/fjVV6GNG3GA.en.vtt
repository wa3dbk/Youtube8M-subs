 hello and welcome to this roulette 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.600
 the recipe of the day and 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.520
 strawberry tiramisu for four 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.940
 people 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:16.150
 we need 500 g strawberries 4th 250 g 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:18.190
 of mascarpone 180 grams of sugar 10 to 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.100
 12 biscuits with a spoon and a half 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.240
 lemon 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.520
 the important thing with a tiramisu is that it 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.000
 have to prepare it for the advanced so there it 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.880
 is 11 o'clock 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.530
 if you 're going to eat 1 tonight will have to 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.810
 do you put dare dare I'll start 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:34.649
 to arrange the biscuits with the spoon 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.649
 at the bottom of the dish 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.340
 I washed my strawberries I'm going now 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.690
 be able to listen to them 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.700
 little tip keeps a whole sentence 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.980
 for decoration I water the strawberries with 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.400
 the juice of the half lemon and 2 spoons to 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.400
 sugar soup 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.440
 and crush with the fork here are the 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.149
 grossly crushes the idea it is rather 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.570
 to have a juice that will allow us 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:05.260
 arriving cookies are in a rod 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.260
 the issue 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.560
 we will now separate the whites from 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.560
 egg yolks 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.640
 we are now taking care of mixing 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.750
 mascarpone we will whitewash 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.750
 egg yolks with sugar 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:31.750
 the mixture is well dead if we will be able to 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:33.790
 now incorporate the mascarpone the 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.990
 mascarpone and well incorporate it does we 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.440
 remains to add the whites 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.440
 of eggs in snow 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.270
 add snow whites in half 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.800
 once we add a good spoon of 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.570
 white that we will mix everything 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.250
 simply add everything else and we 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:53.270
 delicately incorporates with 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.800
 ample movements of the arm the plans are 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.330
 to incorporate well we do not have any more 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.620
 than to pour on boudoirs and 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.620
