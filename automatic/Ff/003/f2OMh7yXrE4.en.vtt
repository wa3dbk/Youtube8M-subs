00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
Dragons off one cube yes that's right

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.859 
Dragons off one cube yes that's right
one<00:00:15.360> Q<00:00:15.660> so<00:00:16.439> I'm<00:00:16.529> not<00:00:16.680> programming<00:00:17.150> to<00:00:18.150> Q<00:00:18.509> storm

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
one Q so I'm not programming to Q storm

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.650 
one Q so I'm not programming to Q storm
button<00:00:19.170> I'm<00:00:19.800> putting<00:00:20.340> two<00:00:20.609> igniters<00:00:21.090> parallel

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
button I'm putting two igniters parallel

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.550 
button I'm putting two igniters parallel
into<00:00:22.529> one<00:00:22.769> Q<00:00:23.100> so<00:00:23.939> uh<00:00:23.970> before<00:00:24.840> this<00:00:24.990> we<00:00:25.230> thought

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
into one Q so uh before this we thought

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.490 
into one Q so uh before this we thought
that<00:00:26.119> it<00:00:27.119> can<00:00:27.330> only<00:00:27.449> do<00:00:27.630> one<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:27.990> each<00:00:28.199> queue

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
that it can only do one of each queue

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.859 
that it can only do one of each queue
but<00:00:29.160> we<00:00:29.279> found<00:00:29.640> out<00:00:29.880> that<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.330> can<00:00:30.449> actually<00:00:30.750> do

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
but we found out that it can actually do

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.740 
but we found out that it can actually do
up<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.140> two<00:00:31.590> that's<00:00:32.009> pretty<00:00:32.220> nice<00:00:32.340> so<00:00:32.730> um<00:00:32.910> we've

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
up to two that's pretty nice so um we've

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.469 
up to two that's pretty nice so um we've
got<00:00:33.900> a<00:00:33.930> TNT<00:00:34.410> spiral<00:00:34.830> light<00:00:35.010> here<00:00:35.330> entertain<00:00:36.330> t

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:36.479 
got a TNT spiral light here entertain t

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:38.539 
got a TNT spiral light here entertain t
crazy<00:00:36.750> at<00:00:36.930> all<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:37.650> is<00:00:37.769> the<00:00:37.890> last<00:00:38.070> pretty

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:38.549 
crazy at all and this is the last pretty

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:40.130 
crazy at all and this is the last pretty
much<00:00:38.729> to<00:00:38.879> last<00:00:39.059> in<00:00:39.210> my<00:00:39.299> safe<00:00:39.479> and<00:00:39.659> sane<00:00:39.809> stash

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
much to last in my safe and sane stash

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.430 
much to last in my safe and sane stash
so<00:00:40.680> I'm<00:00:40.909> then<00:00:41.909> probably<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.780> next<00:00:42.900> firework

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
so I'm then probably the next firework

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.740 
so I'm then probably the next firework
video<00:00:43.589> you'll<00:00:44.280> see<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.729> me<00:00:44.909> blowing<00:00:45.479> some

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
video you'll see is me blowing some

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.490 
video you'll see is me blowing some
stuff<00:00:45.839> up<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.320> put<00:00:46.350> up<00:00:46.589> Nevada<00:00:47.339> so<00:00:48.350> unless<00:00:49.350> I

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
stuff up and put up Nevada so unless I

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.320 
stuff up and put up Nevada so unless I
happen<00:00:49.830> again<00:00:50.010> some<00:00:50.129> more<00:00:50.159> stuff<00:00:50.430> just<00:00:51.210> a

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:51.330 
happen again some more stuff just a

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.060 
happen again some more stuff just a
little<00:00:51.570> note<00:00:51.720> here<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:52.199> think<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:52.769> all<00:00:52.890> know

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
little note here I think you all know

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.979 
little note here I think you all know
that<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.280> usually<00:00:53.640> don't<00:00:53.729> use<00:00:53.909> zip<00:00:54.119> ties<00:00:54.299> I<00:00:54.629> just

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
that I usually don't use zip ties I just

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.570 
that I usually don't use zip ties I just
used<00:00:55.170> tape<00:00:55.409> because<00:00:55.650> it's<00:00:55.890> much<00:00:56.040> easier<00:00:56.070> and

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:56.580 
used tape because it's much easier and

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.479 
used tape because it's much easier and
zip<00:00:57.540> ties<00:00:57.750> are<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.170> little<00:00:58.440> more<00:00:58.739> inconvenient

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
zip ties are a little more inconvenient

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.140 
zip ties are a little more inconvenient
but<00:01:00.299> I<00:01:01.159> had<00:01:02.159> to<00:01:02.250> make<00:01:02.369> an<00:01:02.489> exception<00:01:02.939> che

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150
