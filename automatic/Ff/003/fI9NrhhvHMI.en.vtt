00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
do a touring show so I knew I was going

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.200 
do a touring show so I knew I was going
to<00:00:21.180> use<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.390> tent<00:00:21.810> but<00:00:22.529> how<00:00:23.340> can<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:23.640> do<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.910> show

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.570 
to use a tent but how can you do a show
in<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.720> tent<00:00:24.930> would<00:00:25.080> not<00:00:25.320> be<00:00:25.529> in<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.680> circus<00:00:25.890> so

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
in the tent would not be in a circus so

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.250 
in the tent would not be in a circus so
this<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:26.880> where<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.210> question<00:00:27.630> started<00:00:28.050> so

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
this is where the question started so

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.740 
this is where the question started so
its<00:00:28.769> first<00:00:28.890> started<00:00:29.429> with<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.609> seating<00:00:29.910> the
