00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 we have to assume that 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:06.450
 Looking ahead is dead we know it 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.280
 somehow he succeeded in his 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.019
 vehicle to scroll but we were able to 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.360
 near the accident site his corpse 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.799
 we do not find further when we know 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.360
 they would have found someone in yes 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.780
 brought a nearby hospital 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.699
 been 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.890
 no doubt it's out there somewhere 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.240
 buried in the snow on the first purchase 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.070
 further we will find him 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.019
 that is because the enlightener is not ahead 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.390
 we expected what is quite possible 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.000
 was you do not believe that he is dead 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.880
 Well, maybe not 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.809
 like this he is never alone from the 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.210
 crept 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.800
 you can see them at the door 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.800
 someone pulled him out 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:49.219
 she must not be dead misselwitz 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:52.770
 west may not be dead 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:57.920
 In 1871 , women often died in childbeds 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.920
 The most important thing is the spirit with the end 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:11.460
 was then no one is she died 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.970
 then gently passed away takes place 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:18.200
 sentence they look easy 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.200
 even done there 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.830
 Today is a great day for you to stay 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.940
 no longer sit all year 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:39.560
 that's what it's like to build 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:42.509
 big surprise your new studio 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.720
 after all, writer one 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:49.080
 space for work that can work 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.770
 Write what do you think what I think 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.780
 should write 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.660
 they will write a new novel 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:02:05.220
 for their greatest achievement ever 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:02:07.500
 misery and just do not believe that 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.380
 someone will not help you either 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.330
 Doctors look for their agent after theirs 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.790
 family 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.700
 I never called her, nobody knows 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.820
 that we are here and prefer to offer them 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:25.220
 that nothing happens to me because if I 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.220
 they too should die
