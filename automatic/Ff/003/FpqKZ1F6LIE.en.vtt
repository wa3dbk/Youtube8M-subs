00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
change very much as I go to the double

pedal

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.709

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:23.719 
you can also hear I like to do what I

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:25.690 
you can also hear I like to do what I
say<00:01:23.990> is<00:01:24.259> kind<00:01:24.649> of<00:01:24.740> greasing<00:01:25.100> it<00:01:25.189> down<00:01:25.369> to<00:01:25.579> the

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
say is kind of greasing it down to the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.490 
say is kind of greasing it down to the
pedal<00:01:25.969> note<00:01:26.119> from<00:01:26.600> the<00:01:26.750> regular<00:01:27.079> register

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
pedal note from the regular register

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.969 
pedal note from the regular register
just<00:01:28.039> like<00:01:28.250> to<00:01:28.429> have<00:01:28.850> the<00:01:28.969> feeling<00:01:29.299> of<00:01:29.360> the<00:01:29.479> air

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
just like to have the feeling of the air

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.850 
just like to have the feeling of the air
being<00:01:30.979> continuous<00:01:31.929> so<00:01:32.929> it<00:01:33.140> will<00:01:33.679> sound

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
being continuous so it will sound

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:44.169 
being continuous so it will sound
hopefully<00:01:41.979> and<00:01:42.979> then<00:01:43.130> just<00:01:43.369> dropping<00:01:43.759> to<00:01:44.000> the

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:44.179 
hopefully and then just dropping to the

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:55.449 
hopefully and then just dropping to the
double<00:01:44.689> pedal<00:01:53.319> and<00:01:54.319> maybe<00:01:54.619> once<00:01:55.099> I<00:01:55.189> get<00:01:55.340> down

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:55.459 
double pedal and maybe once I get down

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:56.830 
double pedal and maybe once I get down
to<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:55.670> bottom<00:01:55.880> I'll<00:01:56.149> start<00:01:56.360> to<00:01:56.450> take<00:01:56.599> it<00:01:56.720> back

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
to the bottom I'll start to take it back

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:08.690 
to the bottom I'll start to take it back
up

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.449 

and<00:03:03.819> then<00:03:04.299> when<00:03:04.420> I<00:03:04.450> go<00:03:04.950> back<00:03:05.950> to<00:03:06.129> the<00:03:06.250> upper

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
and then when I go back to the upper

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.309 
and then when I go back to the upper
register<00:03:06.849> even<00:03:07.540> if<00:03:07.629> I<00:03:07.720> start<00:03:07.989> in<00:03:08.049> the<00:03:08.110> middle

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
register even if I start in the middle

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.619 
register even if I start in the middle
part<00:03:08.440> of<00:03:08.530> the<00:03:08.620> register<00:03:09.069> I<00:03:09.280> try<00:03:10.209> to<00:03:10.269> have<00:03:10.480> that

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:10.629 
part of the register I try to have that

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:19.720 
part of the register I try to have that
feeling<00:03:10.870> in<00:03:10.989> my<00:03:11.140> chops<00:03:11.410> in<00:03:11.560> the<00:03:11.590> mouthpiece

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.160 

if<00:03:20.730> I<00:03:20.819> go<00:03:20.970> to<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.180> upper<00:03:21.360> note<00:03:21.540> I<00:03:21.720> try<00:03:21.930> to<00:03:21.990> make

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
if I go to the upper note I try to make

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.780 
if I go to the upper note I try to make
sure<00:03:22.290> I<00:03:22.319> keep<00:03:22.590> those<00:03:22.800> tops<00:03:23.010> together<00:03:23.220> and<00:03:23.670> that

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
sure I keep those tops together and that

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.960 
sure I keep those tops together and that
they<00:03:23.880> don't<00:03:24.000> spread<00:03:24.860> so<00:03:25.860> hopefully<00:03:26.819> that

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
they don't spread so hopefully that

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.140 
they don't spread so hopefully that
gives<00:03:27.000> you<00:03:27.180> a<00:03:27.270> little<00:03:27.510> bit<00:03:27.660> of<00:03:27.830> insight<00:03:28.830> into

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
gives you a little bit of insight into

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.880 
gives you a little bit of insight into
the<00:03:30.150> way<00:03:30.270> that<00:03:30.300> I<00:03:30.480> use<00:03:30.720> double<00:03:31.230> pedals<00:03:31.680> and

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
the way that I use double pedals and

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.650 
the way that I use double pedals and
there's<00:03:32.459> a<00:03:32.550> lot<00:03:32.700> more<00:03:32.730> information<00:03:33.240> out<00:03:33.630> there

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
there's a lot more information out there

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.120 
there's a lot more information out there
I'm<00:03:34.050> sure<00:03:34.320> I<00:03:34.560> think<00:03:34.800> Tebow<00:03:36.320> has<00:03:37.320> quite<00:03:37.950> a<00:03:37.980> bit

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
I'm sure I think Tebow has quite a bit

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.400 
I'm sure I think Tebow has quite a bit
of<00:03:38.220> work<00:03:38.310> with<00:03:38.520> the<00:03:38.610> double<00:03:38.880> pedals<00:03:39.180> as<00:03:40.080> I

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
of work with the double pedals as I

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.199 
of work with the double pedals as I
think<00:03:40.620> Claude<00:03:40.830> Gordon<00:03:41.190> does<00:03:41.370> and<00:03:41.670> many<00:03:42.000> other

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
think Claude Gordon does and many other

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.949 
think Claude Gordon does and many other
teachers<00:03:42.450> and<00:03:43.820> so<00:03:44.820> I<00:03:45.150> think<00:03:45.450> that's<00:03:45.780> probably

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
teachers and so I think that's probably

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.540 
teachers and so I think that's probably
enough<00:03:46.080> for<00:03:46.380> today<00:03:46.560> and<00:03:46.830> I<00:03:46.920> hope<00:03:47.040> you<00:03:47.250> enjoyed

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
enough for today and I hope you enjoyed

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.910 
enough for today and I hope you enjoyed
this<00:03:47.760> little<00:03:48.030> look<00:03:48.810> into<00:03:49.050> the<00:03:49.319> double<00:03:49.590> pedals

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
this little look into the double pedals

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.750 
this little look into the double pedals
thanks<00:03:50.820> for<00:03:50.940> listening<00:03:51.209> bye<00:03:51.360> bye
