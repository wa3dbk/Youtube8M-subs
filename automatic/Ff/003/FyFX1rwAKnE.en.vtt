00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
and of course that's where they took the

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.830 
and of course that's where they took the
inspiration<00:04:06.040> from<00:04:06.310> it's<00:04:07.239> very<00:04:07.420> very<00:04:07.630> similar

flash - and of course a loudspeaker

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:07.620 
flash - and of course a loudspeaker
let's<00:05:05.229> open<00:05:05.440> the<00:05:05.680> back<00:05:05.860> and<00:05:06.030> see<00:05:07.030> what<00:05:07.300> else<00:05:07.330> it

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
let's open the back and see what else it

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.140 
let's open the back and see what else it
packs

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.750 

and<00:05:10.360> there<00:05:11.020> you<00:05:11.080> go<00:05:11.230> you<00:05:11.590> have<00:05:11.770> the<00:05:12.040> two<00:05:12.430> sim

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
and there you go you have the two sim

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.080 
and there you go you have the two sim
slots<00:05:13.090> sim<00:05:13.570> 1<00:05:13.870> and<00:05:14.169> the<00:05:14.650> sim<00:05:14.889> 2<00:05:15.190> and<00:05:15.490> of<00:05:15.760> course

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
slots sim 1 and the sim 2 and of course

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.530 
slots sim 1 and the sim 2 and of course
you<00:05:16.750> also<00:05:16.900> have<00:05:17.139> the<00:05:18.030> microSD<00:05:19.030> card<00:05:19.270> slot

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.540 
you also have the microSD card slot

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.330 
you also have the microSD card slot
right<00:05:19.889> then<00:05:20.889> all<00:05:21.130> in<00:05:21.460> the<00:05:21.550> same<00:05:21.699> place<00:05:22.139> now

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
right then all in the same place now

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.159 
right then all in the same place now
that's<00:05:24.340> about<00:05:24.490> it<00:05:24.729> for<00:05:25.360> the<00:05:25.479> hardware

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:26.169 
that's about it for the hardware

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:28.439 
that's about it for the hardware
walkthrough<00:05:26.800> let's<00:05:27.100> pop<00:05:27.790> in<00:05:27.910> the<00:05:28.000> battery<00:05:28.419> and

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:28.449 
walkthrough let's pop in the battery and

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:30.780 
walkthrough let's pop in the battery and
see<00:05:28.840> what<00:05:29.050> the<00:05:29.199> software<00:05:29.410> is<00:05:29.710> like<00:05:30.010> running<00:05:30.699> on

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790 
see what the software is like running on

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.770 
see what the software is like running on
Android<00:05:31.270> 4.2<00:05:31.960> jelly<00:05:32.260> bean<00:05:32.350> and<00:05:33.630> should<00:05:34.630> be

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
Android 4.2 jelly bean and should be

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.219 
Android 4.2 jelly bean and should be
interesting<00:05:35.440> to<00:05:35.470> see<00:05:35.760> how<00:05:36.760> the<00:05:37.229> keyboard

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:38.229 
interesting to see how the keyboard

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:42.780 
interesting to see how the keyboard
shortcuts<00:05:38.800> and<00:05:39.010> all<00:05:39.130> that<00:05:39.370> are<00:05:39.630> handled<00:05:41.790> it's

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:42.790 
shortcuts and all that are handled it's

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.150 
shortcuts and all that are handled it's
pretty<00:05:43.240> tricky<00:05:43.450> to<00:05:43.600> install<00:05:44.080> the<00:05:44.229> battery<00:05:44.350> so

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160 
pretty tricky to install the battery so

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.770 
pretty tricky to install the battery so
the<00:05:45.250> battery<00:05:45.580> is<00:05:45.639> popped<00:05:45.940> in<00:05:46.180> let's<00:05:46.479> power<00:05:46.750> on

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
the battery is popped in let's power on

00:05:46.780 --> 00:06:03.000 
the battery is popped in let's power on
the<00:05:47.080> phone

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.010 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.070 

it's<00:06:03.400> actually<00:06:03.760> pretty<00:06:03.940> weird<00:06:04.330> to<00:06:04.570> see<00:06:04.810> a

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 
it's actually pretty weird to see a

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.650 
it's actually pretty weird to see a
touch<00:06:05.410> screen<00:06:05.560> and<00:06:05.770> QWERTY<00:06:06.670> with<00:06:07.300> a<00:06:07.330> big

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:07.660

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.840 
touch screen and QWERTY with a big
screen<00:06:07.990> like<00:06:08.020> this<00:06:08.820> it's<00:06:09.820> usually<00:06:10.300> a<00:06:11.020> a

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:11.850 
screen like this it's usually a a

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.670 
screen like this it's usually a a
rectangle<00:06:12.850> form<00:06:13.120> factor<00:06:13.510> that's<00:06:13.720> with<00:06:14.440> you

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:14.680 
rectangle form factor that's with you

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.690 
rectangle form factor that's with you
know<00:06:14.800> the<00:06:16.800> mostly<00:06:17.800> four<00:06:18.010> by<00:06:18.190> three<00:06:18.220> form

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:18.700 
know the mostly four by three form

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:23.060 
know the mostly four by three form
factor<00:06:19.150> but<00:06:19.330> this<00:06:20.170> is<00:06:20.610> kind<00:06:21.610> of<00:06:21.730> different

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.070 
factor but this is kind of different

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:26.040 
factor but this is kind of different
it's<00:06:24.070> a<00:06:24.250> three<00:06:24.430> by<00:06:24.580> two<00:06:24.640> form<00:06:25.030> factor<00:06:25.480> and<00:06:25.720> is

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.050 
it's a three by two form factor and is

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.580 
it's a three by two form factor and is
usually<00:06:26.530> suited<00:06:27.220> for<00:06:27.490> touchscreens<00:06:28.300> and<00:06:28.720> not

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:29.590 
usually suited for touchscreens and not

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:32.640 
usually suited for touchscreens and not
coatis<00:06:30.520> so<00:06:30.700> there<00:06:30.880> you<00:06:30.940> go<00:06:31.060> that's<00:06:31.210> the<00:06:31.420> UI<00:06:32.260> of
