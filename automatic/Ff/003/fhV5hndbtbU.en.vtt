I'll<00:01:54.740> be<00:01:54.980> showing<00:01:55.220> you<00:01:55.900> just<00:01:56.900> like<00:01:57.290> a<00:01:57.320> test<00:02:00.490> um

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
I'll be showing you just like a test um

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.340 
I'll be showing you just like a test um
I<00:02:01.970> didn't<00:02:02.300> do<00:02:02.390> it<00:02:02.479> that<00:02:02.600> time<00:02:02.660> but<00:02:03.020> you<00:02:03.140> should

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
I didn't do it that time but you should

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.340 
I didn't do it that time but you should
probably<00:02:03.500> press<00:02:03.979> it<00:02:04.840> firmly<00:02:05.840> against<00:02:06.229> the

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
probably press it firmly against the

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.710 
probably press it firmly against the
steam<00:02:06.650> or<00:02:07.250> because<00:02:07.970> if<00:02:08.149> it<00:02:08.240> drops<00:02:08.509> it's

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
steam or because if it drops it's

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
steam or because if it drops it's
probably<00:02:09.050> enough<00:02:09.229> break<00:02:09.440> something<00:02:09.860> like<00:02:11.740> but

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
probably enough break something like but

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.460 
probably enough break something like but
there<00:02:12.920> it<00:02:13.040> is<00:02:13.330> for<00:02:14.330> a<00:02:14.390> while<00:02:14.630> even<00:02:15.050> when<00:02:15.290> it's

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
there it is for a while even when it's

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.860 
there it is for a while even when it's
going<00:02:15.680> really<00:02:15.830> slow<00:02:16.280> because<00:02:17.270> um<00:02:19.600> most<00:02:20.600> of<00:02:20.780> the

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
going really slow because um most of the

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.229 
going really slow because um most of the
weight<00:02:21.080> like<00:02:21.290> literally<00:02:22.190> like<00:02:22.489> 70<00:02:22.880> percent<00:02:23.209> of

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
weight like literally like 70 percent of

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.520 
weight like literally like 70 percent of
the<00:02:23.360> weight<00:02:23.510> is<00:02:23.870> on<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.320> outside<00:02:25.420> so<00:02:26.420> it<00:02:26.450> um<00:02:26.900> it

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
the weight is on the outside so it um it

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.790 
the weight is on the outside so it um it

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
try and do another maybe two more can't

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.120 
try and do another maybe two more can't
really<00:04:11.110> give<00:04:11.260> it<00:04:11.350> a<00:04:13.890> second

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
really give it a second

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:33.650 
really give it a second
you<00:04:15.400> see<00:04:16.030> I'm<00:04:16.390> pulling<00:04:16.780> the<00:04:16.870> string<00:04:17.109> really<00:04:17.320> so

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.590 

you<00:04:34.660> can<00:04:34.840> also<00:04:34.960> sort<00:04:35.890> of<00:04:36.010> here<00:04:36.450> but<00:04:37.450> it's

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
you can also sort of here but it's

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.600 
you can also sort of here but it's
mostly<00:04:37.960> hitting<00:04:38.350> the<00:04:38.500> tipping<00:04:38.919> track<00:04:39.280> of<00:04:39.490> the
