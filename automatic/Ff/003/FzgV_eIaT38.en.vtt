00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:07.830
 in the year 2013 I separated some news 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.920
 of the market for you to have a more 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.440
 healthy much easier and time- consuming 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.389
 to make those handicrafts so good 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.359
 that we show that in our scenario 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.880
 and today I'm going to talk about a 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:25.529
 The acquisition that I made was worth it. 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.529
 a fryer will not go amazing eye 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.619
 nothing goes with oil and everything gets very 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:35.610
 Crunchy, I'll introduce you to her. 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.340
 She has a basket I should 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.809
 warm up before putting a steak 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:47.270
 one is a potato I've done several 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:52.170
 cars any fry you use this 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:56.610
 The first joke is three minutes. 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:01:00.140
 connected to heat that 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.140
 to stick anything 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:07.250
 I'll put some potatoes warm. 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:13.680
 I bought in the 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:17.280
 supermarket but you can make the 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.920
 potatoes cut in your house without being 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:26.640
 frozen everything is all right 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:28.500
 Now I come back and I go for 15 minutes and I 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.909
 I have the power to choose the plan 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.450
 200 degrees 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:36.929
 if it was not frozen in ten minutes I 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.509
 I would have the crispy fries 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:40.380
 The cool thing about all this is that when it comes to 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.500
 to wash 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:48.720
 you simply highlight the lava grill 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.390
 easily and back in place 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.090
 low energy consumption and leaves a 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.640
 very healthy life because no fat 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.810
 we do not have both triglycerides and 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.720
 cholesterol 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.810
 Finally, it's a worthwhile investment. 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.030
 Do you have it in your house when you go? 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.359
 getting crayons or something that has nothing 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.519
 of fat you only have one cell 

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:14.340
 color olive oil 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:18.090
 So this is the machine that I chose the 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.359
 My 2013 will be the super quiet year for 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.359
 we 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.730
 ready you look you realize that the 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:30.580
 potatoes are golden it puts 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:34.450
 without the need to put paper 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:37.540
 towel because it was not any oil, right? 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:43.870
 and nothing stuck in here 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:46.900
 look at the golden sunshine and the question without 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.360
 a drop of oil and it is with this tip that 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.280
 I close the feminine scenario of today and 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.680

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.410
