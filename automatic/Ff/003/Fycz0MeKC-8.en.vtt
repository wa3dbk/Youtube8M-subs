00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hi nice that you look at horses again 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.700
 talk tv today i'll show you how 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.990
 you can make your own language highest and 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.370
 pretty can decorate 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.080
 if you want to know how you make this look 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.590
 then on and so really true so difficult 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.809
 if you think okay well let's start 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.190
 making our own language level 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.230
 you can also just buy them in the store 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.760
 but make sidewalk much more fun because 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.320
 I can choose the color for you 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.119
 things to do 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.760
 below the video I will put exactly 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.170
 what you all need and how much we do 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.300
 let's just start right away 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.340
 I take my own head there and I go that one 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.660
 Measuring sizes around I know did already 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.489
 sure it fits 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.800
 I'm going to first pick up the nose piece that is 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.379
 this gap 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.629
 this is about 60 centimeters of tits 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.430
 bigger what you have to do before is gone 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.050
 search for the center of your language i have 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.550
 all at the ends that look together 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.469
 and I'll just keep going until 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.120
 I have the middle look we are on it 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.399
 end here is the middle with me 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.199
 then you take a piece of tape and that slice 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.000
 you right there in the middle we 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.859
 just measured the nostril that was 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.780
 about 60 centimeters 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.420
 now we go that 60 centimeters through 2 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.010
 then share both sides 30 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.580
 get centimeters then it fits well 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.950
 his nose 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.080
 I adjust it to tape measure on something 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.619
 will leave more than 30 centimeters later 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.890
 see why that is i use 34 35 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.390
 centimeters like this 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.710
 those bitches that are now stuck that 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.330
 we don't get stuck, we get it 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.229
 soon off so just for the sizes 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.479
 to mark 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.100
 what we are going to do now is very simple you 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.900
 take the middle tape you 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.159
 and one of those teplice on the side and 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.180
 right in the middle 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.180
 you make a knot 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.350
 please wait and slide just as long 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.240
 until it is about the middle 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.130
 now you also know why we are just slightly 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.090
 have taken more than those 30 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.560
 centimeters 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.180
 because need some rope to 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.340
 you can take the button now 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.810
 the middle you tape and then the other tape you 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.950
 where no button lighter you do 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.689
 also exactly the same 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.000
 ok we now have two buttons and that 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.990
 three bitches you can now take those beeps off 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.460
 because you no longer need it 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.079
 with as it may not if you later set 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.560
 I 'm going to do it now because they stick 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.780
 we little and the table now i go here it 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.619
 make a knot with both the tower such that 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.619
 this becomes a loop 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.640
 take a good look at those buttons 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.830
 the middle are going to now start 30 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.790
 measure centimeters record size just 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.470
 from me 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.599
 I have a pair so I use that 30 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.880
 centimeters if you are a little pony you 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.019
 have us a little less already 25 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.260
 about 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.880
 I take this rope and I measure from here 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.900
 that 30 centimeter bag with a button with 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.900
 a feast on it 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.800
 yourself the language in which you just had that lesson 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.500
 then you go find the end of it 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.980
 find your language and with it you go through the 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.980
 button 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.920
 you keep the door all the way through 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:56.290
 then you go with the end through that 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:57.520
 other button like that 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.290
 that triangle that we have on this side 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.990
 we have created that too 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.550
 make this side about the same size 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.400
 all we have to do now is 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.530
 the head piece maker is the piece behind 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.120
 his ears are sticking ends now 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.690
 by the lesson you just made 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:17.920
 take my own halt and that i put the 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:19.270
 just take a look 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.570
 well i think this is actually nice 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:24.370
 is that you have only one thing left to do 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.130
 you tie a knot here that is not 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:30.300
 can shift more if needed 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.300
 you also make a double knot 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.940
 and now you have your own rope halter 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.350
 but how nice is it if you just do this 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.120
 can style yourself 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.470
 if you do something ashore then 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.600
 preferably on the side and has you 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.580
 horse has the least trouble so I have 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.650
 this self made a little bohemian 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.880
 style with feathers and a flower 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.500
 of course you can do it all yourself 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.900
 making decorations you can not be so crazy 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.160
 think how fat is this look all that 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.450
 nice colors 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.290
 I am curious what it looks like 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.580
 and whether that fits of course hello look 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:03.850
 once 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.850
 but now the door is through 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.800
