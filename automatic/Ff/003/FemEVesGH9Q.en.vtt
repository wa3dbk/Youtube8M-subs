crate<00:00:49.050> into<00:00:49.350> space<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:50.579> this<00:00:50.850> month's

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
crate into space and so this month's

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.790 
crate into space and so this month's
theme<00:00:51.270> was<00:00:52.550> launched<00:00:54.020> this<00:00:55.020> box<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.530> bigger

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
theme was launched this box is bigger

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.139 
theme was launched this box is bigger
than<00:00:55.980> normal<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:57.890> it<00:00:58.890> has<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.129> launch<00:00:59.489> base<00:00:59.820> on

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
than normal and it has a launch base on

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.029 
than normal and it has a launch base on
it<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.719> was<00:01:01.020> expecting<00:01:01.350> some<00:01:01.620> kind<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.829> like

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
it so I was expecting some kind of like

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.960 
it so I was expecting some kind of like
rocket<00:01:02.670> or<00:01:02.820> something<00:01:02.969> inside<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.539> crate<00:01:04.970> I'm

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
rocket or something inside the crate I'm

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.719 
rocket or something inside the crate I'm
sure<00:01:06.150> most<00:01:06.299> of<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.540> probably<00:01:06.630> seen<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.260> by<00:01:07.380> now

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
sure most of you probably seen it by now

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.679 
sure most of you probably seen it by now
two<00:01:08.729> months<00:01:08.970> old<00:01:09.150> but<00:01:09.799> it's<00:01:10.799> been<00:01:11.630> quite<00:01:12.630> some

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
two months old but it's been quite some

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.219 
two months old but it's been quite some
time<00:01:12.840> since<00:01:12.990> I've<00:01:13.439> looked<00:01:13.740> in<00:01:13.860> them<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:15.229> it'll

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
time since I've looked in them so it'll

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.630 
time since I've looked in them so it'll
probably<00:01:16.259> be<00:01:16.650> surprised<00:01:17.040> when<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.280> open<00:01:17.549> them

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640
