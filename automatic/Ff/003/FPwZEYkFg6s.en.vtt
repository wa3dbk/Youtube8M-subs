00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
so rough well the way I like to explain

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.150 
so rough well the way I like to explain
it<00:00:52.750> to<00:00:52.840> my<00:00:52.960> patients<00:00:53.470> when<00:00:53.620> they<00:00:53.739> come<00:00:53.950> in

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
it to my patients when they come in

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.799 
it to my patients when they come in
usually<00:00:54.579> during<00:00:54.940> the<00:00:55.090> winter<00:00:55.360> months<00:00:55.390> they're

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
usually during the winter months they're

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:57.569 
usually during the winter months they're
saying<00:00:56.050> they're<00:00:56.260> dry<00:00:56.590> they're<00:00:56.890> irritated

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
saying they're dry they're irritated

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:00.180 
saying they're dry they're irritated
they<00:00:58.210> can't<00:00:58.510> maintain<00:00:59.110> the<00:00:59.530> products<00:00:59.980> that

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
they can't maintain the products that

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.639 
they can't maintain the products that
they<00:01:00.309> have<00:01:00.520> all<00:01:00.760> year<00:01:00.940> round<00:01:01.000> and<00:01:01.649> basically

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
they have all year round and basically

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:04.590 
they have all year round and basically
the<00:01:02.890> skin<00:01:03.160> is<00:01:03.309> made<00:01:03.489> up<00:01:03.670> of<00:01:03.820> multiple<00:01:04.059> layers

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
the skin is made up of multiple layers

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.230 
the skin is made up of multiple layers
and<00:01:05.019> the<00:01:05.079> outermost<00:01:05.680> layer<00:01:06.070> consists<00:01:06.850> of<00:01:06.969> dead

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
and the outermost layer consists of dead

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.050 
and the outermost layer consists of dead
skin<00:01:07.570> cells<00:01:07.930> and<00:01:08.259> your<00:01:09.070> natural<00:01:09.790> oil

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
skin cells and your natural oil

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.529 
skin cells and your natural oil
production<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:12.310> basically<00:01:12.939> this<00:01:13.119> outermost

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:13.539 
production so basically this outermost

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:16.319 
production so basically this outermost
layer<00:01:13.990> acts<00:01:14.350> as<00:01:14.709> a<00:01:14.740> saran<00:01:15.490> wrap<00:01:15.759> if<00:01:15.969> you<00:01:16.119> will

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:16.329 
layer acts as a saran wrap if you will

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:19.319 
layer acts as a saran wrap if you will
to<00:01:16.780> keep<00:01:17.049> the<00:01:17.380> moisture<00:01:17.649> in<00:01:18.009> and<00:01:18.490> to<00:01:18.759> keep<00:01:18.999> the

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:19.329 
to keep the moisture in and to keep the

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:22.859 
to keep the moisture in and to keep the
elements<00:01:19.990> out<00:01:20.139> ok<00:01:20.889> so<00:01:21.670> the<00:01:21.850> mainstay<00:01:22.389> of<00:01:22.420> your

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
elements out ok so the mainstay of your

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:24.989 
elements out ok so the mainstay of your
winter<00:01:23.229> treatment<00:01:23.770> with<00:01:24.069> the<00:01:24.280> drier<00:01:24.609> air

00:01:24.989 --> 00:01:24.999 
winter treatment with the drier air

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:28.739 
winter treatment with the drier air
outside<00:01:25.539> and<00:01:26.020> the<00:01:26.350> dry<00:01:26.649> force<00:01:27.189> in<00:01:27.520> our<00:01:28.090> heat

00:01:28.739 --> 00:01:28.749 
outside and the dry force in our heat

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:31.590 
outside and the dry force in our heat
inside<00:01:29.259> yeah<00:01:29.679> is<00:01:29.950> to<00:01:30.459> maintain<00:01:30.639> the<00:01:31.060> hydration

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
inside yeah is to maintain the hydration

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.539 
inside yeah is to maintain the hydration
of<00:01:31.630> the<00:01:32.020> skin<00:01:32.289> ok<00:01:32.709> so<00:01:32.770> that<00:01:33.159> I<00:01:33.189> guess<00:01:33.369> the

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
of the skin ok so that I guess the

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.969 
of the skin ok so that I guess the
number<00:01:33.819> one<00:01:34.090> is<00:01:34.240> moisturizing<00:01:35.049> and<00:01:35.499> that

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
number one is moisturizing and that

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.660 
number one is moisturizing and that
helps<00:01:36.369> the<00:01:36.609> the<00:01:37.090> hydration<00:01:38.020> as<00:01:38.469> well<00:01:38.829> exactly

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
helps the the hydration as well exactly

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.249 
helps the the hydration as well exactly
and<00:01:40.060> the<00:01:40.359> big<00:01:40.509> thing<00:01:40.539> I<00:01:40.869> think<00:01:41.079> in<00:01:41.200> the

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
and the big thing I think in the

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:43.440 
and the big thing I think in the
wintertime<00:01:41.590> is<00:01:42.099> our<00:01:42.249> bathing<00:01:42.490> routines<00:01:43.119> I

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
wintertime is our bathing routines I

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.149 
wintertime is our bathing routines I
mean<00:01:43.659> it's<00:01:43.810> always<00:01:43.990> tempting<00:01:44.439> to<00:01:44.799> taste<00:01:45.009> that

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
mean it's always tempting to taste that

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.489 
mean it's always tempting to taste that
take<00:01:45.459> a<00:01:45.490> nice<00:01:45.819> long<00:01:46.209> hot<00:01:46.659> shower<00:01:46.990> when<00:01:47.380> it's

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:47.499 
take a nice long hot shower when it's

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:49.980 
take a nice long hot shower when it's
cold<00:01:47.740> outside<00:01:48.240> but<00:01:49.240> that<00:01:49.450> will<00:01:49.689> actually

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
cold outside but that will actually

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.440 
cold outside but that will actually
decrease<00:01:50.619> the<00:01:51.130> amount<00:01:51.219> of<00:01:51.490> natural<00:01:51.700> oil<00:01:52.209> on

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
decrease the amount of natural oil on

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.749 
decrease the amount of natural oil on
your<00:01:52.599> skin<00:01:52.889> so<00:01:53.889> some<00:01:54.099> of<00:01:54.130> the<00:01:54.279> things<00:01:54.490> that<00:01:54.579> you

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
your skin so some of the things that you

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.529 
your skin so some of the things that you
can<00:01:54.939> do<00:01:55.179> are<00:01:55.539> just<00:01:55.990> shower<00:01:56.289> once<00:01:57.009> a<00:01:57.189> day<00:01:57.539> keep

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
can do are just shower once a day keep

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:01.169 
can do are just shower once a day keep
it<00:01:58.719> to<00:01:58.869> 10<00:01:59.049> minutes<00:01:59.349> using<00:01:59.799> warm<00:02:00.520> water<00:02:00.609> rather

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:01.179 
it to 10 minutes using warm water rather

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:03.899
