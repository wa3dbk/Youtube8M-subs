 they will like it and they are very easy to 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.270

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:38.150

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.350
 two spoons of sugar 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.410
 4 eggs 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.130
 and for the filling you require two 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:50.680
 sliced bananas 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.680
 two tablespoons of butter 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.100
 please a spoonful of sugar 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.579
 masked 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:02.629
 a spoonful of vanilla in what 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:05.239
 you require half a cup of cream 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.450
 hazelnuts or it can also be chocolate 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:11.320
 melted whatever you want and walnuts 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.940
 chopped to serve that is really 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.539
 simple then what are we going to do 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:20.330
 to start is the mix look here 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:23.350
 we have a bowl and we are going to start with 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:26.979
 the flour we are going to put the flour 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:29.200
 and the sugar we are going to incorporate with a 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.050
 globe or fork do not worry if you do not 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:38.370
 has a balloon at hand 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:38.370
 add the 4 eggs 4 whole eggs 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:48.979
 and milk then let's start 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.440
 Mix the same for crepes is like 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:55.070
 a mix for hard cakes 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.620
 well fine thin well very light 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.800
 liquid is nothing thick everything 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:03.980
 opposite and I think that the key to a 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.900
 good cream is in the pan in the 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.860
 Teflon pan ado and that is 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:13.220
 preheated leave it about 4 or 5 minutes to 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:17.540
 fire half the fire that is half 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:21.080
 of its intensity a little bit higher 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.600
 that half and so the pan will be 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.880
 waiting for the crepe to perfection and 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:30.260
 will cook very well you will see 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:33.110
 then we mix very well and mix 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.870
 you have to let it rest at least one 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.630
 time in the refrigerator write down very well 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.400
 in your recipe let it rest in the 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.740
 Covered refrigerator can be or 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.950
 uncovered of any problem by a 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.830
 hour 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.620
 there it is and finally the butter 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:53.340
 melted the butter to which it goes to 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:56.370
 Give silkiness to crepes and we will 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:03:01.080
 be very rich and fluffy then 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:03.660
 mix ready and we have now what 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.930
 I was commenting the pan the pan not 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.970
 must have too much butter 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.849
 only the necessary then that 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:15.450
 It makes a washcloth with cloth 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:19.170
 kitchen or a napkin you are going to 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:22.200
 start putting butter on it we take a 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:25.340
 little bit more so that we do not leave 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:29.910
 hit and leave is believed good bread 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:31.980
 wonderful then what just also 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.739
 can put oil but I think the 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:40.130
 butter is much more suitable 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:43.250
 then ready we have butter 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:46.400
 let's put our mix that has already 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:50.900
 reposed can take a spoon like 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:53.180
 these and that is your measurement then 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.700
 quickly we take the pan and 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.330
 we started spinning so that all the 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.560
 mix of the crepe is distributed 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.320
 perfectly and there's the secret that 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.480
 Be very thin if it is very very 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.880
 thick will look like flour tortilla 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.660
 then we do not want to believe that it is 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:14.300
 well fine thin and meanwhile 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:17.510
 what we are going to do is cook our 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.549
 bananas that are going to be delicious are 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.550
 very easy to do we put the 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.950
 butter I'm going to take it out of the fire 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:28.330
 while I cut the banana and 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.330
 He directed the cream too 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:35.590
 banana slices start at the 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:38.530
 let's put directly in the pan 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.660
 let's make these slices that good 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:44.310
 you can do them as I said 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:47.080
 strawberry cream cheese what you want 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.310
 then with butter the banana knows 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.040
 A wonderful 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.960
 is 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.450
 we are going to put a little sugar 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.150
 that is the procedure 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:00.760
 first the butter the banana the 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:04.090
 sugar we let it caramelize a 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.590
 little bit and does not know the wonder of 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.110
 banana in fact bananas can 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:11.260
 serve with the side the vanilla side and 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.360
 they are delicious and you know that it gives you a 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.640
 delicious touch also a little bit of 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.800
 vanilla extract this makes you smell 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.980
 with more fair to me it reminds me a lot 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:24.490
 the fairs where you go to one of small and 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:26.980
 good eats delicious so it smells like sugar 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:29.320
 and vanilla then we put out the fire 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:32.650
 they are ready and what we are going to do 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.500
 is to turn the cream over there is it 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.390
 blood pa 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.090
 I do it with my hands but I 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:42.670
 can do with a fork with a 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:45.820
 spatula and it is perfect then 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:47.860
 let's do it 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:50.230
 there is the other side nothing but a 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.330
 kitten that cooks because it's almost there 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.670
 list what we do take 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:58.900
 our believes to turn it around 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:06:01.480
 fold it in half and wonderful believe 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:04.150
 for already saw how easy it is to make it 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:08.140
 secret as I tell you is in refrigerate 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:11.920
 mix one hour and the pan already 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:15.310
 be hot waiting for us at temperature 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:17.830
 constant try not to wait long for 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:20.050
 pan of the fire because they cool down are 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:22.330
 questions I do not like to call him 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.940
 delicate but you must have a 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:27.130
 little bit of care there for him 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.030
 come out perfect and they know they say that 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:31.670
 the first cream 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:33.650
 it never comes out that wax never comes out 

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:35.660
 you have to throw it away always so 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:38.600
 good morning will tell me if the first one 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:43.300
 He came then we turn to this 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:47.620
 wonder and how rich and we will serve it 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:51.210
 in a dish like I have here 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:54.280
 let's put the bananas 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:57.940
 caramelized delicious 

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:59.860
