so<00:03:43.050> that<00:03:43.200> came<00:03:43.349> out<00:03:43.500> pretty<00:03:43.680> clear

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.790 

I<00:03:47.340> want<00:03:47.850> to<00:03:47.940> try<00:03:48.090> something<00:03:48.300> with<00:03:48.710> quite<00:03:49.710> a<00:03:49.740> bit

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:23.960 

so<00:04:22.590> looks<00:04:22.740> like<00:04:22.889> it<00:04:23.009> picked<00:04:23.580> up<00:04:23.699> the<00:04:23.879> image

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
so looks like it picked up the image

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:37.730 
so looks like it picked up the image
really<00:04:24.389> well

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.910 

looks<00:04:38.370> good

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:05:04.989 

this<00:04:49.150> paisley<00:04:49.900> type<00:04:50.289> design

00:05:04.989 --> 00:05:04.999 

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:10.209 

oops<00:05:05.659> I<00:05:06.019> forgot<00:05:06.559> to<00:05:06.829> wipe<00:05:07.219> my<00:05:07.610> stamp<00:05:09.069> try<00:05:10.069> that

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:22.169 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:24.429 

again<00:05:22.949> it<00:05:23.189> looks<00:05:23.219> like<00:05:23.430> it<00:05:23.610> picked<00:05:23.819> up<00:05:23.909> the

00:05:24.429 --> 00:05:24.439 
again it looks like it picked up the

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:43.420 
again it looks like it picked up the
image<00:05:25.439> pretty<00:05:26.069> well

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.920 

it<00:05:44.430> kind<00:05:44.699> of<00:05:44.730> didn't<00:05:44.970> transfer<00:05:45.360> well<00:05:45.690> to<00:05:45.810> some

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
it kind of didn't transfer well to some

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:53.930 
it kind of didn't transfer well to some
parts<00:05:46.199> but<00:05:46.380> I<00:05:46.620> took<00:05:46.740> I<00:05:47.460> was<00:05:47.790> slow<00:05:52.669> go<00:05:53.669> with<00:05:53.760> the

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
parts but I took I was slow go with the

00:05:53.940 --> 00:06:15.370 
parts but I took I was slow go with the
sky<00:05:54.180> here

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:15.380 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.050 

okay

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:17.060

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:21.620 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.439 

I'm<00:06:22.130> not<00:06:22.310> worried<00:06:22.550> about<00:06:22.639> really<00:06:23.000> lining<00:06:23.330> it

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:23.449 
I'm not worried about really lining it

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:26.710 
I'm not worried about really lining it
up<00:06:23.540> well<00:06:23.780> but<00:06:25.030> because<00:06:26.030> I<00:06:26.180> just<00:06:26.330> want<00:06:26.510> to<00:06:26.570> show

you<00:06:26.780> how<00:06:27.050> while<00:06:27.320> I<00:06:27.350> stamp<00:06:32.380> so<00:06:33.380> that<00:06:33.530> worked

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.939 

and<00:06:36.430> let's<00:06:37.300> go<00:06:37.449> with<00:06:37.539> this<00:06:37.720> one<00:06:37.780> here<00:06:38.530> this<00:06:38.740> one

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:38.949 
and let's go with this one here this one

00:06:38.949 --> 00:07:04.400 
and let's go with this one here this one
looks<00:06:39.159> pretty<00:06:39.310> detailed<00:06:39.849> as<00:06:40.060> well

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:04.410 

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:09.510 

okay

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:09.520 

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:12.180 

so

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:12.190 

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:15.870 

this<00:07:12.760> plate<00:07:13.320> works<00:07:14.320> really<00:07:14.620> well<00:07:14.880> it's

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:15.880 
this plate works really well it's

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.690 
this plate works really well it's
definitely<00:07:16.360> worth<00:07:16.720> the

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:17.700 
definitely worth the

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:21.720 
definitely worth the
$11.99<00:07:18.700> that<00:07:19.420> I<00:07:19.450> paid<00:07:19.690> for
