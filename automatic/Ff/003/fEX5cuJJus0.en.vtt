00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.009
 you have to live in the now she can come to you 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.819
 because I do not love it continues him 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.460
 should 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:12.389
 I have to live in the now because you hear 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.820
 it in very, very much and certainly in 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:19.439
 the between construction tank and spiritual 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:22.410
 industry or sometimes pan and I get so 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.420
 against people who have it very hard 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.330
 yeah i live more and more in it 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.550
 here and now and then you see it is 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.210
 of course a very nice step that she 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.800
 not anymore 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.510
 are making plans for over 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.860
 two years 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.829
 but that we only have their plans 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.280
 pull out over the day or over the week 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.500
 header is of course a lot less 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.480
 far into the future 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.829
 but 2 hours in the future is still 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.420
 future 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.300
 5 minutes in the future is still 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.530
 future and really in the here and now 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.579
 life is impossible to fully exploit 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.039
 to lay 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:07.260
 really living in the here and now is one 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:09.960
 solving any kind of goals 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.890
 every kind of want every kind of 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.560
 plan 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:19.380
 really living in the here and now 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:22.680
 is completely congruent and 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:26.479
 on this vertical line and completely 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.479
 completely merge with the self 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.990
 who is linked to 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.100
 what about the illusion of sweet free will 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.280
 also twist on this line 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:42.450
 functions is a zero check 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.450
 because in this line 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.820
 function your personality or it 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.049
 ego that all it in and then there later 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.350
 lives in 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:55.000
 in this line that is all gone 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.670
 it just from the full 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:04.270
 merge into this line there is there 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:06.970
 a form of control possible but 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.149
 there is no more part 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:13.450
 and here we empty the 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:16.660
 limit of being in not being 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:20.560
 This in this illusion is there is a time 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.690
 so we so we walk around on this one 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.030
 time at 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.769
 is the majority of people who do not themselves 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:33.459
 not aware of a mist takes a but 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:35.410
 So here when you come in and 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.480
 an app access to this then it becomes 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.530
 Reasonably different but he is there 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.730
 still 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:47.739
 I therefore live in this intersection 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:50.700
 being experienced from this intersection two 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.700
 layers of your fields 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.840
 so that seems like a contradiction to that 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.870
 there is only unity and it 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.579
 duality is an illusion 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:06.040
 because when you get out of this timeline 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:08.709
 once there is only one he but 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.579
 when in dimension look further and do 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:15.790
 with from beyond that there is another one 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:18.070
 very wide variety I all 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.880
 for it can rotate unit 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.880
 so in essence 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.549
 and I understand that and not 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:29.500
 clearer while I say so 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:32.380
 realize that it is impossible from 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.060
 my level here a statement veresti 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:40.750
 is understandable 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:43.680
 but unity is also just akos have only 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.680
 it's a next step
