00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.970
 hello dear friends nice that again 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.250
 a shiver at briggs photo this time 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.710
 I do not set a 08 15 off the rack for 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.050
 you but a replica of me 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.599
 found here in this book that 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.430
 i call lego creative that i have from 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.500
 to get my wife to christmas and 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.920
 There are many interesting things in it 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.449
 consider and various construction techniques here 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.970
 there is also a section about 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:44.390
 the american lego artist bruce 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.400
 lee 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.739
 he is known for the so-called lol 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.989
 ball or 14th 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.660
 here we have the original ball im 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.609
 detail with building instructions total 74 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.890
 parts on the basis of which one can now 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:00.170
 Nice rounds if your objects build like 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.690
 For example, this year is the same 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.679
 that oskar on wiener mobile original from 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.690
 bruce lee 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:07.340
 so that the model has liked so much and 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.750
 I wanted to build it for myself and 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.850
 Of course I also show you in 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.539
 written an e-mail he had nothing 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.940
 on the other hand 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:16.399
 then I went to work and 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.710
 built in weeks of miniscule my 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:20.420
 version of oscar mayer mobile again 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.310
 because it also original model 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.320
 of course no parts list 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.759
 or even a construction manual could give 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.130
 I only use the model 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.110
 different photos together 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.939
 There was a lot to try and fiddle with 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.450
 necessary for the whole thing to be so stable 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:34.520
 to get 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.500
 that's holds by itself properly 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.329
 I still have one to the vehicle 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.790
 I picked a few beautiful figures 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:42.439
 I would like to show you now 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.630
 me two cooks now taken for 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:47.840
 me as grillmeister both and the man 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.610
 in the otto costume figured out of the mini 13 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.619
 The two grill masters each have one 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.960
 a sticker on top for you to get it from me 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.189
 get that with the oscar mayer logo 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.810
 logo can also be found on the back 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:58.610
 However, this is not a stick of 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.740
 but a proper print you could 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.119
 Think the original of lego like that though 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.969
 No, I have that on customer request 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:07.009
 let it be at the point of impression comes 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:08.660
 It really a great alternative for 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.670
 all not so on sticker now 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.590
 stand the hotdog man from the mini 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.000
 figurine series 13 I have also easy 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.190
 He has changed a new one 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.950
 he now has his head from head 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.049
 The yard except for Kastel took care of that 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.600
 Thanks again to the 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:25.340

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.930
 my head provided 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.160
 to have 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.629
 in addition to the vehicle and the mini 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.490
 I have more figures for me 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.770
 Accessories built a mobile kitchen 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.950
 and a small advertising display the 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:39.290
 Tiles 2 x 2 in white are also all 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.750
 printed on the stand and the kitchen 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.950
 At the front of the kitchen there is one 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.260
 small refrigerator than 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.260
 of course bulging with the 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.550
 coveted oscar sausages on the 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.710
 you can still change the other side 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.050
 recognize where the sausages grilled 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:56.180
 on a gas grill and down 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.340
 you see a gas bottle with a 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.740
 small display of a bracket for one 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.930
 knife and of course a sausage 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.370
 here we go from mustard and 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.310
 ketchup you can then depending on 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.930
 please portion yourself without 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.180
 The mobile kitchen consists of sausages 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.250
 Incidentally, from a total of 50 share here 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.870

 I can use parts exactly that 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.270
 unfortunately not say because I always have 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.970
 One turn and a purpose built and 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.590
 unfortunately you lose the overview 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.060
 the two oscar mayer logos as well as the 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.160

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.800
 to print 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:48.110
 wiener mobile has been around since 1936 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:52.430
 model for the model is the vehicle 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:54.710
 from the year 1952 in the 50s was 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.930

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.850
 Of course you will also find it on the wiener 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.980
 mobile to stay true to the original 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.840
 I thought I do in my 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.880
 also chrome parts on it 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.310
 Unfortunately, the parts are not original 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.060
 Lego parts but decorated later 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.880
 with chrome 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.440
 these are so-called custom a parts 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.670
 we find another casting part in the back 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.770
 to the bumpers and that 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.299
 license plate or number plates 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.460

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.500
 Lego style print on customer request 

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:24.740
 Of course template also served 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.480
 here the original vehicle 1952 were 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.990
 by the way, only five of these vino mobile 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.270
 built 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.730
 One can marvel at the henry ford 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.550

 Vehicles in mini figures scale 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.120
 I picked the lego again 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.870
