00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:38.179 
than the end resort so what we do and in

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:39.999 
than the end resort so what we do and in
a<00:01:38.479> nutshell<00:01:38.659> is<00:01:39.020> break<00:01:39.229> things<00:01:39.469> down<00:01:39.560> to

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
a nutshell is break things down to

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.459 
a nutshell is break things down to
logical<00:01:40.729> pieces<00:01:40.939> and<00:01:41.420> then<00:01:41.749> we<00:01:41.840> analyze<00:01:42.289> those

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:42.469 
logical pieces and then we analyze those

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:44.139 
logical pieces and then we analyze those
pieces<00:01:42.770> and<00:01:42.950> figure<00:01:43.310> out<00:01:43.399> how<00:01:43.490> those<00:01:43.850> pieces

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
pieces and figure out how those pieces

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:45.789 
pieces and figure out how those pieces

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
what's important the score is just a

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.129 
what's important the score is just a
byproduct<00:01:55.759> of<00:01:56.240> the<00:01:56.389> words<00:01:56.569> and<00:01:56.810> an<00:01:56.869> overall

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
my favorite part about it is the fact

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.339 
my favorite part about it is the fact
that<00:04:38.979> it<00:04:39.129> is<00:04:39.340> actually<00:04:39.699> an<00:04:40.000> album<00:04:40.569> yeah<00:04:40.960> you

that it is actually an album yeah you

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:42.869 
that it is actually an album yeah you
know<00:04:41.439> it<00:04:41.590> plays<00:04:41.889> from<00:04:42.159> start<00:04:42.430> to<00:04:42.550> finish<00:04:42.849> and

00:04:42.869 --> 00:04:42.879 
know it plays from start to finish and

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:44.730 
know it plays from start to finish and
you<00:04:43.030> don't<00:04:43.360> ever<00:04:43.599> want<00:04:43.719> to<00:04:43.930> skip<00:04:44.139> a<00:04:44.169> track<00:04:44.469> in

you don't ever want to skip a track in
fact<00:04:44.949> I<00:04:45.129> would<00:04:45.430> argue<00:04:45.460> that<00:04:45.939> the<00:04:46.030> last<00:04:46.210> three

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:46.539 
fact I would argue that the last three

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:48.270 
fact I would argue that the last three
songs<00:04:46.810> are<00:04:47.080> some<00:04:47.500> of<00:04:47.590> the<00:04:47.650> best<00:04:47.800> songs<00:04:48.009> on<00:04:48.189> the

songs are some of the best songs on the

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.700 
songs are some of the best songs on the
album<00:04:48.310> what<00:04:49.090> the<00:04:49.210> devil<00:04:49.569> ELP<00:04:50.110> doesn't<00:04:50.469> choose

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
album what the devil ELP doesn't choose

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.680 
album what the devil ELP doesn't choose
to<00:04:50.740> use<00:04:51.009> a<00:04:51.039> lot<00:04:51.280> of<00:04:51.310> courses<00:04:51.939> in<00:04:52.060> his<00:04:52.180> music<00:04:52.539> so

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
to use a lot of courses in his music so

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:53.969

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:27.759 
does it knock it out of the park because

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:30.029 
does it knock it out of the park because
it<00:05:27.909> makes<00:05:28.060> it<00:05:28.270> inherently<00:05:28.840> more<00:05:29.440> catchy<00:05:29.740> now

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039

if<00:05:30.129> you<00:05:30.250> were<00:05:30.340> to<00:05:30.400> do<00:05:30.639> that<00:05:30.669> on<00:05:31.000> every<00:05:31.240> single

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:31.509 
if you were to do that on every single

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:32.550 
if you were to do that on every single
song<00:05:31.690> I<00:05:31.840> don't<00:05:32.020> think<00:05:32.139> it<00:05:32.199> would<00:05:32.289> have<00:05:32.379> been<00:05:32.440> as

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.080 
song I don't think it would have been as
no<00:05:32.740> but<00:05:32.949> it<00:05:33.009> is<00:05:33.099> a<00:05:33.129> good<00:05:33.310> mix<00:05:33.580> after<00:05:33.940> that<00:05:34.060> I

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
no but it is a good mix after that I

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.309 
no but it is a good mix after that I
like<00:05:34.300> what<00:05:34.449> you<00:05:34.539> said<00:05:34.569> about<00:05:34.810> this<00:05:35.020> being<00:05:35.080> a

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:35.319
