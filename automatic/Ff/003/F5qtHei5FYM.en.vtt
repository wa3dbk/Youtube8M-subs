00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:46.559
 op - you today want to show a 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.140
 Work that came here is a girl. 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:53.460
 asked me to bore her 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.910
 a few cups if those holes with her she 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.809
 is building a chandelier she saw 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.809
 na on the magazine channel home and garden 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:09.240
 she will use an electric cable is double 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:12.420
 Isolation is of the insulation and it is this cable 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.210
 out is 8mm and I'm 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:19.440
 making a 10-millimeter hole for her 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.869
 so that this cable is a little loose 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:26.610
 here and that allows the glass 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:30.030
 and also this slack prevents the 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.070
 glass will break in the future a 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.490
 time that every time you make a 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.280
 well understood and that you intend to 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.920
 hole is inside out 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.770
 You will break the glass there will work. 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:49.290
 with a wedge and will break the glass will 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:52.320
 open the glass she had been looking for some 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.820
 before I contract her 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.189
 had sought to turn their 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.220
 glaziers for refusing to set 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.650
 because it 's a rather boring job than 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.110
 to be done or really a show I'll talk 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.450
 for her that even the parties to 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.360
 suitable for any cup containing furac 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.590
 good part and that is what motivated me 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:16.489
 make a book make a video really 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:20.570
 it is the cups they are most likely to 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.570
 leave because 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:29.570
 once I make a hole in the bottom I 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:34.370
 shot the harmony of mass victory 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:37.130
 glass is constant and is the organization 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.050
 he is always working 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.450
 so much is that it is still always that 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.600
 Serving the dispute, just go down. 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.510
 molecular weight it is taken as 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.280
 nike dutta because its molecules still 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.110
 are organizing 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.020
 differently from a solid but this is 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.459
 another matter is let's practice 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.800
 which is what matters to us here 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:01.100
 so what actually happens for what? 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:04.790
 this is not so that the account is 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.630
 avoid or reduce those who decide 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.580
 leave 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.970
 We have to do some things. 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.860
 first I'll make a hole be 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.310
 great as this is a bore of 10 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.800
 12 mm or 8 mm 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.090
 hole that fits is not that fleeing 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.020
 of the bromate drill 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.000
 I need to use a bench drill 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:30.350
 because because here I have the control 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 speed and different from a glass 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.180
 normal that we work with 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.549
 higher speeds for drilling 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:40.610
 and that's why the glazier said 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:42.950
 what part in the case coming we work 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:48.320
 as if it were metal sticking we go 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:50.239
 work at lower speeds and in 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.269
 frontier bench we have this 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:55.579
 ability to control the speed 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:58.220
 another thing is the chuck vibration 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:00.410
 even a drill with a simple 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.060
 cheap drilling bench as is the case 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.670
 my very simple 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.769
 it has much less mandrel variation 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.590
 than a standard drill until 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:11.690
 I'm not susceptible not only the 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.060
 chuck but as the vibration of the hand itself 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:17.540
 that in the case of the glass it gets very 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:20.350
 sensitive to this type of situation is 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.490
 important that there is no such vibration 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.490
 all normal 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:28.160
 Okay so this is another point I could 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:31.090
 use a good drill holder 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.940
 sense drill cute fluffy wood and 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.310
 support too 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.170
 I see no problem, this is more 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.220
 preferably a 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:43.140
 stand 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:45.090
 Okay, you can stick it in the hand, it's the flash without 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:48.000
 be with the first manual can stick 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.760
 can can stick but the chances of that 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.950
 From the glass is much higher 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.990
 already have to worry about knowing 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.210
 You have to be aware of this 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:00.300
 so ok then so this is basically 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:03.780
 is the other thing is like I do not have 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:06.570
 a way of sticking on both sides as in 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:09.600
 video is from whatever glass I mentioned 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.640
 that we stick on one side and the other 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.800
 future is in the center 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:17.130
 as there is not as we need 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:20.070
 protect and if this book for the inside 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:22.680
 this to minimize the chance of facing 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.610
 a splinter to prohibit even firm 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.810
 glass 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.140
 So that's what I did for the daughter. 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:30.960
 asked that I did a protection, okay? 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:33.090
 put the body on top of it 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.650
 the other thing you'll see there I went 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.320
 walking the other thing is beyond 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:41.010
 refrigeration in this case it is important that 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.450
 We're turning the glass a little. 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:45.750
 as it sticks it will give us 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:49.530
 small routines with a glass so that the 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:52.080
 As far as I'm boring here I do not 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:54.000
 I run the risk of ending up in a place 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:58.560
 first than in the other ideal that 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.540
 Exactly accurate finishes all glass 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:04.350
 at the same time it helps a lot in 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:07.380
 hole quality internally reduces 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:09.750
 very the issue of splintering ok then 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.370
 are points for Edilson to generate for 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.190
 the other thing bench drill 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:16.320
 usually we do makes it much more 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:19.530
 leveraged we make much more force 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:22.020
 so be very careful here we do not 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:25.919
 let's lower the washing drive 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:29.590
 very soft and subtle this will help 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:31.930
 also to avoid these problems. 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.940
 Let's go to the practice of the going thing. 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:37.020
 sticking now you will see there like me 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.020
 I do who 

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:25.330
 Okay, it 's right here, the ball is gone. 

00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:27.850
 always releases some vaccines 

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:30.669
 I think you will not see it from there, but the 

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:31.960
 times loose some chips is part 

00:07:30.669 --> 00:07:34.120
 unfortunately you can not find a 

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:37.840
 hole in the middle but any shape 

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:41.770
 It's okay, the hole is fine 

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:45.970
 It was nice, it was right downtown, it's not 

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:47.889
 gave major defects so you can see 

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:51.099
 How do I think I understand a 

00:07:47.889 --> 00:07:53.530
 from the beginning and if there is still 

00:07:51.099 --> 00:07:55.690
 Any questions you may have may 

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:57.910
 ask and in the comments that I who 

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:59.830
 I can answer something else 

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:02.680
 some timely and detailed questions then 

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:04.240
 with more this mission accomplished let's 

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:06.849
 ending but this video 

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:09.030
 a hug to everyone and until the next 

00:08:06.849 --> 00:08:09.030
 job
