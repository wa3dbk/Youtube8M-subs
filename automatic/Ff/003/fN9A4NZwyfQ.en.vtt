00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
ways you can interrupt your opponent is

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.180 
ways you can interrupt your opponent is
by<00:03:28.810> knocking<00:03:29.350> them<00:03:29.500> down<00:03:29.709> while<00:03:30.010> they're

tip<00:04:04.780> we're<00:04:04.930> going<00:04:04.959> to<00:04:05.080> be<00:04:05.170> talking<00:04:05.470> about<00:04:05.530> is

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
tip we're going to be talking about is

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.940 
tip we're going to be talking about is
blocking<00:04:06.430> during<00:04:06.670> combat<00:04:07.180> now<00:04:07.720> all<00:04:08.350> weapon

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
blocking during combat now all weapon

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.710 
blocking during combat now all weapon
types<00:04:09.160> can<00:04:09.340> block<00:04:09.640> but<00:04:09.940> of<00:04:10.060> course<00:04:10.270> one<00:04:10.510> hand

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
types can block but of course one hand

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.510 
types can block but of course one hand
and<00:04:10.840> shield<00:04:11.080> is<00:04:11.260> the<00:04:11.290> most<00:04:11.530> effective<00:04:12.100> due<00:04:12.370> to

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520 
and shield is the most effective due to

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.250 
and shield is the most effective due to
the<00:04:12.640> passage<00:04:13.030> that<00:04:13.180> it<00:04:13.300> gives<00:04:13.510> but<00:04:14.110> that

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
the passage that it gives but that

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.960 
the passage that it gives but that
shouldn't<00:04:14.560> prevent<00:04:14.590> you<00:04:15.040> from<00:04:15.100> blocking<00:04:15.640> with

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
shouldn't prevent you from blocking with

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.240 
shouldn't prevent you from blocking with
other<00:04:16.209> weapons<00:04:16.419> such<00:04:16.690> as<00:04:16.810> bows<00:04:17.140> and<00:04:17.380> staff<00:04:17.680> you

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
other weapons such as bows and staff you

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.909 
other weapons such as bows and staff you
do<00:04:18.430> effectively<00:04:19.000> cut<00:04:19.209> off<00:04:19.330> half<00:04:19.810> the<00:04:20.080> DPS<00:04:20.560> when

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
do effectively cut off half the DPS when

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.640 
do effectively cut off half the DPS when
you're<00:04:21.070> blocking<00:04:22.110> but<00:04:23.110> you<00:04:23.200> got<00:04:23.320> to<00:04:23.410> keep<00:04:23.500> in

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
you're blocking but you got to keep in

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.110 
you're blocking but you got to keep in
mind<00:04:23.860> when<00:04:24.160> you're<00:04:24.250> blocking<00:04:24.700> you<00:04:24.820> do<00:04:24.940> lose

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
mind when you're blocking you do lose

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.060 
mind when you're blocking you do lose
stamina<00:04:25.720> for<00:04:25.900> every<00:04:26.050> hit<00:04:26.200> that<00:04:26.410> you<00:04:26.530> take<00:04:26.800> and

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
stamina for every hit that you take and

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.980 
stamina for every hit that you take and
if<00:04:27.400> you're<00:04:27.520> at<00:04:27.669> a<00:04:27.820> stamina<00:04:28.360> you<00:04:28.480> can<00:04:28.630> no<00:04:28.750> longer

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
if you're at a stamina you can no longer

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.409 
if you're at a stamina you can no longer
block<00:04:29.290> so<00:04:30.010> you<00:04:30.729> have<00:04:30.850> to<00:04:30.970> block<00:04:31.150> the<00:04:31.270> right

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
block so you have to block the right

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:32.940 
block so you have to block the right
attacks<00:04:31.810> what<00:04:32.050> I<00:04:32.080> usually<00:04:32.200> do<00:04:32.500> for<00:04:32.860> example

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
attacks what I usually do for example

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.100 
attacks what I usually do for example
against<00:04:33.430> sorcerer's<00:04:33.880> is<00:04:34.150> I<00:04:34.750> will<00:04:34.900> try<00:04:35.080> to

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
against sorcerer's is I will try to

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.770 
against sorcerer's is I will try to
block

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
block

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.810 
block
crystal<00:04:36.170> shards<00:04:36.620> so<00:04:36.860> I<00:04:37.220> don't<00:04:37.460> get<00:04:37.550> knocked

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
crystal shards so I don't get knocked

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.000 
crystal shards so I don't get knocked
down<00:04:37.970> because<00:04:38.389> when<00:04:38.540> you're<00:04:38.660> blocking<00:04:39.260> you<00:04:39.830> do

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
down because when you're blocking you do

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.700 
down because when you're blocking you do
not<00:04:40.280> only<00:04:40.580> negate<00:04:40.910> be<00:04:41.270> half<00:04:41.930> of<00:04:42.050> DPS<00:04:42.440> but

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
not only negate be half of DPS but

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.740 
not only negate be half of DPS but
certain<00:04:43.280> spells<00:04:43.820> that<00:04:44.090> knock<00:04:44.300> you<00:04:44.510> down<00:04:44.690> you

do to get the knockdown of those effects

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.390 
do to get the knockdown of those effects
