00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
gonna get it they're bullet let's use a

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.920 
gonna get it they're bullet let's use a
machine<00:01:32.189> gun<00:01:32.490> bullet<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:34.070> sniper<00:01:35.070> bullet

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.080 

so<00:01:40.720> yes<00:01:40.960> it<00:01:41.230> shoots<00:01:41.620> all<00:01:42.340> these<00:01:42.550> bullets<00:01:42.910> but

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
so yes it shoots all these bullets but

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.850 
so yes it shoots all these bullets but
it<00:01:43.210> shoots<00:01:43.450> the<00:01:43.960> buzz<00:01:44.110> people<00:01:44.260> at<00:01:44.530> the<00:01:44.620> best

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
it shoots the buzz people at the best

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.980 
it shoots the buzz people at the best
because<00:01:45.760> it<00:01:46.540> fits<00:01:47.050> perfectly<00:01:47.980> in<00:01:48.250> the<00:01:48.730> tube

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
because it fits perfectly in the tube

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.740 
because it fits perfectly in the tube
this<00:01:49.990> buzz<00:01:50.260> bee<00:01:50.470> is<00:01:50.710> a<00:01:50.740> bit<00:01:51.040> thicker<00:01:51.340> than

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
this buzz bee is a bit thicker than

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.550 
this buzz bee is a bit thicker than
these<00:01:52.750> ones<00:01:53.370> so<00:01:54.370> it<00:01:54.610> it's<00:01:55.330> it<00:01:56.020> traps<00:01:56.320> the<00:01:56.530> air

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
these ones so it it's it traps the air

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.400 
these ones so it it's it traps the air
better<00:01:57.030> anyway<00:01:58.030> so<00:01:58.090> for<00:01:58.630> the<00:01:58.750> back<00:01:59.020> to<00:01:59.170> the<00:01:59.260> gun

00:01:59.400 --> 00:01:59.410 
better anyway so for the back to the gun

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.610 
better anyway so for the back to the gun
so<00:01:59.710> to<00:02:00.570> make<00:02:01.570> this<00:02:01.750> gun<00:02:01.990> you'll<00:02:02.170> need<00:02:02.320> like<00:02:02.500> an

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.610 
five bucks and the water bottle you know
are<00:02:17.980> they<00:02:18.130> got<00:02:18.250> those<00:02:18.459> so<00:02:19.180> how<00:02:19.990> this<00:02:20.140> works<00:02:20.200> is

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
are they got those so how this works is

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.080 
are they got those so how this works is
you<00:02:20.800> pump<00:02:21.070> air<00:02:21.220> with<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.180> pump<00:02:23.490> and<00:02:24.490> the<00:02:24.760> air

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
you pump air with the pump and the air

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.960 
you pump air with the pump and the air
goes<00:02:25.390> through<00:02:25.750> this<00:02:25.840> tube<00:02:25.900> and<00:02:26.790> into<00:02:27.790> the

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
goes through this tube and into the

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.660 
goes through this tube and into the
valve<00:02:28.209> the<00:02:28.780> valve<00:02:28.810> then<00:02:29.350> goes<00:02:30.070> into<00:02:30.580> the

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
valve the valve then goes into the

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.030 
valve the valve then goes into the
bottle<00:02:31.060> and<00:02:31.240> stores<00:02:31.870> up<00:02:32.080> pressure<00:02:32.440> in<00:02:32.830> this

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
bottle and stores up pressure in this

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.830 
bottle and stores up pressure in this
bottle<00:02:33.490> when<00:02:34.060> you<00:02:34.180> release<00:02:34.570> the<00:02:34.600> pressure

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
bottle when you release the pressure

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.560 
bottle when you release the pressure
from<00:02:35.350> the<00:02:35.530> bottle<00:02:35.860> using<00:02:36.040> this<00:02:36.310> valve<00:02:36.640> all<00:02:37.150> the

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
from the bottle using this valve all the

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.960 
from the bottle using this valve all the
pressure<00:02:37.780> from<00:02:38.050> this<00:02:38.170> bottle<00:02:39.010> shoots<00:02:39.400> out<00:02:39.670> and

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
pressure from this bottle shoots out and

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.650 
pressure from this bottle shoots out and
it<00:02:40.180> makes<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.260> bullet<00:02:41.410> fly<00:02:42.330> it's<00:02:43.330> pretty<00:02:43.510> easy

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
it makes the bullet fly it's pretty easy

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.199 
it makes the bullet fly it's pretty easy
to<00:02:43.810> make<00:02:44.050> it's<00:02:44.610> probably<00:02:45.610> going<00:02:45.700> to<00:02:45.760> cost<00:02:45.940> you

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
to make it's probably going to cost you

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.290 
to make it's probably going to cost you
about<00:02:46.320> twenty<00:02:47.320> dollars<00:02:47.560> to<00:02:47.890> make<00:02:48.070> and<00:02:48.340> it's

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
about twenty dollars to make and it's

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.440 
about twenty dollars to make and it's
the<00:02:49.480> fastest<00:02:50.080> gun<00:02:50.350> it's<00:02:50.680> I<00:02:51.090> like<00:02:52.090> to<00:02:52.239> call<00:02:52.390> it

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
the fastest gun it's I like to call it

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.330 
the fastest gun it's I like to call it
