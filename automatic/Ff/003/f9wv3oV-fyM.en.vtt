00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.099 
a blanket sounds that be interesting
because<00:03:35.519> and<00:03:35.790> rogues<00:03:36.299> would<00:03:36.479> have<00:03:36.720> I<00:03:36.930> feel

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
because and rogues would have I feel

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:39.409 
because and rogues would have I feel
like<00:03:37.260> more<00:03:37.650> our<00:03:37.979> openings<00:03:38.909> for<00:03:39.150> different

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:39.419 
like more our openings for different

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:41.469 
like more our openings for different
combinations<00:03:39.870> of<00:03:39.959> teams<00:03:40.620> we<00:03:40.769> could<00:03:40.949> run<00:03:41.040> with

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:41.479 
combinations of teams we could run with

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:44.149 
combinations of teams we could run with
will<00:03:42.479> also<00:03:42.690> make<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:43.019> ability<00:03:43.349> very<00:03:43.919> much

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 
will also make the ability very much

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:45.559 
will also make the ability very much
interesting<00:03:44.639> you<00:03:44.849> can<00:03:44.909> do<00:03:45.090> increase<00:03:45.359> its

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
interesting you can do increase its

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.050 
interesting you can do increase its
energy<00:03:45.930> pulse<00:03:46.139> like<00:03:46.440> 40<00:03:46.829> or<00:03:46.859> 45<00:03:47.220> or<00:03:47.519> even<00:03:47.760> 50

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
energy pulse like 40 or 45 or even 50

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.819 
energy pulse like 40 or 45 or even 50
i'm<00:03:48.120> pretty<00:03:48.359> sure<00:03:48.540> because<00:03:49.319> if<00:03:49.440> you<00:03:49.530> are<00:03:49.650> going

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
i'm pretty sure because if you are going

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.460 
i'm pretty sure because if you are going
for<00:03:49.919> the<00:03:50.099> blanket<00:03:50.549> like<00:03:50.760> you<00:03:50.940> can<00:03:51.090> really<00:03:51.690> make

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
for the blanket like you can really make

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.530 
for the blanket like you can really make
a<00:03:52.500> difference<00:03:52.760> Night<00:03:53.760> Stalker<00:03:54.030> I<00:03:54.209> feel<00:03:54.389> like

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
a difference Night Stalker I feel like

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.360 
a difference Night Stalker I feel like
should<00:03:54.720> be<00:03:54.870> other<00:03:55.109> buffed<00:03:55.470> changes<00:03:56.069> thrown

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
should be other buffed changes thrown

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.159 
should be other buffed changes thrown
out<00:03:56.579> about<00:03:57.180> how<00:03:57.269> is<00:03:57.329> just<00:03:57.510> my<00:03:57.659> opinion<00:03:57.689> but

out about how is just my opinion but

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:00.379 
out about how is just my opinion but
this<00:03:59.040> is<00:03:59.159> because<00:03:59.489> I<00:03:59.639> couldn't<00:04:00.030> really<00:04:00.209> find

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
this is because I couldn't really find

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:03.170 
this is because I couldn't really find

down<00:04:47.910> for<00:04:48.090> pvp<00:04:48.539> still<00:04:48.870> how<00:04:49.320> about<00:04:49.470> this<00:04:49.500> still

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
down for pvp still how about this still

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.409 
down for pvp still how about this still
keeping<00:04:50.009> it<00:04:50.039> it<00:04:50.639> still<00:04:50.820> is<00:04:50.910> a<00:04:50.940> good<00:04:51.090> talent

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 
keeping it it still is a good talent

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:53.689 
keeping it it still is a good talent
it's<00:04:51.600> great<00:04:51.840> for<00:04:52.020> PVE<00:04:52.380> like<00:04:53.039> self<00:04:53.340> heels<00:04:53.550> or

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:53.699 
it's great for PVE like self heels or

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:55.760 
it's great for PVE like self heels or
whatnot<00:04:53.820> when<00:04:54.060> leveling<00:04:54.300> I<00:04:54.660> loved<00:04:55.440> it<00:04:55.590> one

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
whatnot when leveling I loved it one

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.740 
whatnot when leveling I loved it one
leveling<00:04:56.460> well<00:04:56.669> now<00:04:56.789> we'll<00:04:57.240> try<00:04:57.479> to<00:04:57.539> make<00:04:57.690> it

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
leveling well now we'll try to make it

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.719 
leveling well now we'll try to make it
work<00:04:57.960> for<00:04:57.990> pvp<00:04:58.530> but<00:04:58.710> it's<00:04:58.860> just<00:04:59.009> not<00:04:59.070> optimal

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
work for pvp but it's just not optimal

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:01.879 
work for pvp but it's just not optimal
and<00:04:59.970> elusiveness<00:05:00.389> took<00:05:00.660> lead<00:05:00.930> she<00:05:01.530> death<00:05:01.710> is

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
and elusiveness took lead she death is

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:03.590 
and elusiveness took lead she death is
still<00:05:02.039> good<00:05:02.250> i<00:05:02.310> guess<00:05:02.460> for<00:05:02.610> both<00:05:02.970> PVE<00:05:03.210> and<00:05:03.479> pvp

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
still good i guess for both PVE and pvp

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.469 
still good i guess for both PVE and pvp
but<00:05:04.229> you<00:05:04.620> know<00:05:04.770> ah<00:05:04.979> does<00:05:05.880> this<00:05:06.000> might<00:05:06.180> be<00:05:06.330> done

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 
but you know ah does this might be done

but you know ah does this might be done
on<00:05:07.139> it<00:05:07.380> I<00:05:07.560> felt<00:05:08.370> like<00:05:08.430> shuriken<00:05:08.820> toss<00:05:08.970> isn't

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 
on it I felt like shuriken toss isn't

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.240 
on it I felt like shuriken toss isn't
really<00:05:09.539> it<00:05:09.720> kind<00:05:09.990> of<00:05:10.080> fits<00:05:10.440> with<00:05:10.830> the<00:05:10.860> rest<00:05:11.130> of

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
really it kind of fits with the rest of

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.980 
really it kind of fits with the rest of
them<00:05:11.400> because<00:05:11.639> it's<00:05:11.669> come<00:05:12.150> upon<00:05:12.419> generation

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
them because it's come upon generation

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.920 
them because it's come upon generation
or<00:05:13.199> come<00:05:13.650> when<00:05:13.949> storing<00:05:14.370> but<00:05:15.300> shuriken<00:05:15.630> toss<00:05:15.780> I

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
or come when storing but shuriken toss I

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.170 
or come when storing but shuriken toss I
felt<00:05:16.139> like<00:05:16.370> it<00:05:17.370> doesn't<00:05:17.520> really<00:05:17.729> fit<00:05:17.910> well<00:05:18.030> I

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
felt like it doesn't really fit well I

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.000 
felt like it doesn't really fit well I
guess<00:05:18.360> of<00:05:18.479> the<00:05:18.599> style<00:05:18.930> those<00:05:19.380> two<00:05:19.560> are<00:05:19.710> applied

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010
