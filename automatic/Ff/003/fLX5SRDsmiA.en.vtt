00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:06.990
 Hello 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.929
 today we will learn how to make an egg 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.509
 Pochê the opposite is nothing more than one 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.179
 fried egg but instead of staying 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.859
 he fat we stay there in the water 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.529
 then we can also say that he 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.750
 it's a boiled egg without peel for us 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.519
 to get the ideal texture of his and hers 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.619
 that the water is almost like the one I 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.230
 I'm boiling here and I'm going to teach 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.740
 the great secret to making a delicious 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.649
 egg poch number of everything 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.290
 The water is already boiling. I'm going to put 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:43.170
 a little salt from this water to 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:44.040
 temper it and I'll put it a little bit 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.320
 of vinegar 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.530
 I prefer in this case to use vinegar 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:53.370
 rice or vinegar said that mass more or 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.440
 less than two tablespoons of vinegar with 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:02.190
 the water and vinegar change a slight 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:05.369
 stirred and let him want to see very strong 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.930
 now the part and I can do it in 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.479
 a shell like I'm doing here with 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:15.840
 you can you do in a cup 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:18.810
 house that will not have any problem go 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.470
 break an egg and put it inside 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.470
 of this account 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.299
 and now comes the big secret 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.689
 the water is already boiling and I go with a 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.479
 spoon stir the water so that it does 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.310
 a whirlpool in the middle of the pan 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.329
 so he does I will mill 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.329
 I turn off the fire 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.390
 and now we have to have enough 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:55.009
 ability and I come with this 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:02:01.880
 with this new one inside and the secret is 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:05.000
 throw the egg right in the middle and I'll leave 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.700
 he covers dino and waits for him to cook 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.009
 for approximately seven minutes after 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.540
 These seven minutes I'm going to take it starts. 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.040
 with wood and it is ready to 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.099
 serve 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:20.120
 good then of our time here seven 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:22.280
 minutes and project ready when I 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.650
 Shoot him here from the pot and have to take 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.970
 care that it runs well 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.069
 because this water as we have already 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.420
 spiced it with a bit of vinegar not 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:37.190
 It's good that she comes along with the 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:39.380
 preparation here our pochê logical egg 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.390
 that the suggestion is not to serve him 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.190
 The way he's here, it's cool, you. 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.769
 put it on top of a sudden 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.140
 toast that was spent a little bit 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:51.109
 butter was brought through and she got 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.510
 Beautiful golden luscious on top of it 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:56.150
 traditional canopy planet as personal 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.739
 come and put a little bit of truffle 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.350
 it's not that chocolate that we are 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.480
 How is it that it is a fungus? 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.510
 that under a tree and that goes 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.420
 be grated or sliced very son in 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.640
 top of this preparation here in Brazil. 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.560
 people do not find the natural truffle but 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.630
 people find a truffled olive oil that 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.109
 can also be used and put a 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:22.150
 over these people and 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:22.150
