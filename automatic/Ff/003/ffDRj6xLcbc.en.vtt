disassembled<00:01:53.979> the<00:01:54.900> point<00:01:55.900> plate<00:01:56.170> on<00:01:56.350> there

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
disassembled the point plate on there

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.070 
disassembled the point plate on there
and<00:01:56.710> cleaned<00:01:56.920> out<00:01:57.040> the<00:01:57.190> contacts<00:01:57.900> and<00:01:58.900> I'm
