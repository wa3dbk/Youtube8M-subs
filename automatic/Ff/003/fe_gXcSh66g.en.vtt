tried it a little bit last night and I
so<00:00:12.840> I<00:00:12.870> decided<00:00:13.230> I<00:00:13.380> wanted<00:00:13.679> to<00:00:14.070> do<00:00:14.219> a<00:00:14.549> review<00:00:14.790> on

so I decided I wanted to do a review on

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.510 
so I decided I wanted to do a review on
it<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:15.780> this<00:00:16.440> is<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.770> Mac<00:00:16.949> face<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.279> body

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
it and this is the Mac face and body

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.849 
it and this is the Mac face and body
foundation<00:00:17.880> this<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:18.930> not<00:00:19.080> new<00:00:19.380> or<00:00:19.410> anything

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
like that but you know I just figured if

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.710 
like that but you know I just figured if
you're<00:00:22.500> curious<00:00:23.010> about<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.460> or<00:00:23.910> if<00:00:24.269> you<00:00:24.420> hadn't

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
you're curious about it or if you hadn't

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.509 
you're curious about it or if you hadn't

Mirabella
face<00:00:53.969> primer<00:00:54.800> it's<00:00:55.800> like<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.949> silicon<00:00:56.430> based

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
face primer it's like a silicon based

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:04.460 
face primer it's like a silicon based
primer<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.440> got<00:00:58.770> in<00:00:59.520> an<00:00:59.640> Ipsy<00:00:59.879> bag<00:01:03.080> okay<00:01:04.080> so

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
primer that I got in an Ipsy bag okay so

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.410 
primer that I got in an Ipsy bag okay so
starting<00:01:05.220> with<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.430> Mac<00:01:05.610> face<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.030> body

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
starting with the Mac face and body

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.890 
starting with the Mac face and body
foundation<00:01:06.689> I'm<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.890> color<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.400> 3<00:01:08.909> so

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
foundation I'm in the color and 3 so

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.620 
foundation I'm in the color and 3 so
it's<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.140> really<00:01:10.590> liquidy<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:11.360> tried<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:12.600> tried

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
it's a really liquidy I tried I tried

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.020 
it's a really liquidy I tried I tried
applying<00:01:13.260> this<00:01:13.500> with<00:01:13.860> my<00:01:14.040> fingers<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.549> it's

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
applying this with my fingers and it's

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.910 
applying this with my fingers and it's
just<00:01:16.100> too<00:01:17.100> too<00:01:17.880> liquidy<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.780> can<00:01:19.470> play<00:01:19.770> it

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
just too too liquidy so I can play it

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:29.240 
just too too liquidy so I can play it
directly<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.490> brush

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.060 

and<00:01:29.790> I<00:01:30.030> wouldn't<00:01:30.420> use<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.930> beauty<00:01:31.650> blender<00:01:31.680> to

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
and I wouldn't use a beauty blender to

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.830 
and I wouldn't use a beauty blender to
apply<00:01:32.520> this<00:01:32.580> directly<00:01:32.820> because<00:01:33.510> it's<00:01:33.690> so

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
apply this directly because it's so

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.770 
apply this directly because it's so
liquidy<00:01:34.260> it<00:01:34.410> would<00:01:34.560> probably<00:01:34.800> just<00:01:35.780> absorb

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
liquidy it would probably just absorb

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.200 
liquidy it would probably just absorb
into<00:01:37.140> your<00:01:37.710> Beauty<00:01:38.010> Blender<00:01:41.000> even<00:01:42.000> if<00:01:42.090> it's

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
into your Beauty Blender even if it's

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.820 
into your Beauty Blender even if it's
wet<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:44.180> I<00:01:45.180> would<00:01:45.750> suggest<00:01:45.930> just<00:01:46.410> putting<00:01:46.710> it

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
wet so I would suggest just putting it

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:55.070 
wet so I would suggest just putting it
on<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:46.980> brush<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.760> applying<00:01:48.510> it<00:01:48.630> like<00:01:48.810> this<00:01:54.080> so

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
on a brush and applying it like this so

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.770 
on a brush and applying it like this so
that's<00:01:55.500> just<00:01:55.650> the<00:01:55.860> first<00:01:55.890> coat<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.760> suppose<00:01:57.720> I

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
that's just the first coat I suppose I

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.930 
that's just the first coat I suppose I
get<00:01:57.900> it<00:01:58.020> done<00:01:58.140> like<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:58.380> have<00:01:58.580> half<00:01:59.580> and<00:01:59.790> half

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
get it done like I have half and half

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.480 
get it done like I have half and half
but<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:01.700> can<00:02:02.700> always<00:02:02.910> look<00:02:03.780> back<00:02:03.840> at<00:02:04.230> the

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
but you can always look back at the

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.540 
but you can always look back at the
first<00:02:05.490> part<00:02:05.790> of<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.030> video<00:02:06.860> okay<00:02:07.860> so<00:02:07.920> this<00:02:08.310> is

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
first part of the video okay so this is

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.330 
first part of the video okay so this is
one<00:02:08.910> coat<00:02:09.240> of<00:02:09.510> it<00:02:09.810> as<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:10.770> can<00:02:10.920> see<00:02:11.130> it's

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
one coat of it as you can see it's

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.410 
one coat of it as you can see it's
extremely<00:02:12.090> light<00:02:12.840> coverage<00:02:14.150> so<00:02:15.150> I'm<00:02:15.210> going<00:02:15.390> to

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
extremely light coverage so I'm going to

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:27.280 
extremely light coverage so I'm going to
do<00:02:15.630> a<00:02:16.130> little<00:02:17.130> bit<00:02:17.340> more

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.429 

so<00:02:28.099> this<00:02:28.250> is<00:02:28.430> code<00:02:28.760> number<00:02:29.209> two<00:02:29.480> by<00:02:30.230> the<00:02:30.349> way

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:30.439 
so this is code number two by the way

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:32.050 
so this is code number two by the way
this<00:02:30.560> is<00:02:30.769> a<00:02:30.860> Sedona<00:02:31.189> likes<00:02:31.489> angled<00:02:31.849> kabuki

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
this is a Sedona likes angled kabuki

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.140 
this is a Sedona likes angled kabuki
brush<00:02:32.569> it's<00:02:32.959> a<00:02:33.049> number<00:02:33.349> nine<00:02:33.560> ten<00:02:33.950> if<00:02:34.790> you<00:02:35.030> were

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
brush it's a number nine ten if you were

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:57.200 
asleep like three hours but hey this

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.860

last<00:05:57.440> isn't<00:05:57.890> me<00:05:58.070> falling<00:05:58.400> asleep<00:05:58.729> um<00:05:59.240> I

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:03.260 
actually really like this I'm surprised

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.370 
actually really like this I'm surprised
because<00:06:03.710> I<00:06:03.950> generally<00:06:04.520> do<00:06:04.700> not<00:06:04.729> like<00:06:05.380> light

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.380 
because I generally do not like light

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.090 
because I generally do not like light
coverage<00:06:06.830> foundation<00:06:07.720> but<00:06:08.720> what<00:06:09.050> I<00:06:09.380> like

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:10.100 
coverage foundation but what I like

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:14.650 
coverage foundation but what I like
about<00:06:10.400> it<00:06:10.880> is<00:06:11.150> the<00:06:11.960> fact<00:06:12.229> that<00:06:13.300> it<00:06:14.300> gives<00:06:14.540> you

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660 
about it is the fact that it gives you

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.420 
about it is the fact that it gives you
that<00:06:14.780> no<00:06:15.050> makeup<00:06:15.290> makeup<00:06:15.650> look<00:06:15.890> the

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:16.430 
that no makeup makeup look the

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.700 
that no makeup makeup look the
foundation<00:06:16.940> itself<00:06:17.450> not<00:06:17.900> counting<00:06:18.110> the<00:06:18.440> price

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:18.710 
foundation itself not counting the price

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.560 
foundation itself not counting the price
the<00:06:18.979> foundation<00:06:19.430> itself<00:06:19.790> is<00:06:20.030> probably<00:06:20.240> a<00:06:20.390> nine

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.570 
the foundation itself is probably a nine

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:25.719 
the foundation itself is probably a nine
out<00:06:20.720> of<00:06:20.750> ten<00:06:22.510> but<00:06:23.510> you<00:06:24.260> know<00:06:24.380> it<00:06:25.280> depends<00:06:25.669> on

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:25.729 
out of ten but you know it depends on

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:27.070 
out of ten but you know it depends on
what<00:06:25.880> you're<00:06:25.970> looking<00:06:26.120> for<00:06:26.510> so<00:06:26.720> if<00:06:26.810> you<00:06:26.900> want

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.080 
what you're looking for so if you want

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.110 
what you're looking for so if you want
that<00:06:27.140> light<00:06:27.380> coverage<00:06:27.830> this<00:06:28.580> would<00:06:28.820> be<00:06:28.910> great

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 
that light coverage this would be great

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.719 
that light coverage this would be great
it's<00:06:29.510> really<00:06:29.780> great<00:06:30.229> it<00:06:30.410> lasted<00:06:30.979> obviously

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:31.729 
it's really great it lasted obviously

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:33.280 
it's really great it lasted obviously
for<00:06:31.910> ten<00:06:32.090> hours<00:06:32.120> and<00:06:32.479> it<00:06:32.720> looks<00:06:32.870> just<00:06:33.080> like<00:06:33.200> it

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:33.290 
for ten hours and it looks just like it

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:34.690 
for ten hours and it looks just like it
did<00:06:33.530> when<00:06:33.680> I<00:06:33.740> first<00:06:33.950> applied<00:06:34.220> it<00:06:34.490> I<00:06:34.550> mean

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:34.700 
did when I first applied it I mean

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.300 
did when I first applied it I mean
honestly<00:06:35.060> like<00:06:35.410> other<00:06:36.410> than<00:06:36.740> touching<00:06:36.950> it<00:06:37.190> up

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:37.310 
honestly like other than touching it up
