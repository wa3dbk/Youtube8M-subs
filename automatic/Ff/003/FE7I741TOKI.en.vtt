00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.339
 van stolwijk more January 

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:13.629
 but after in the last few days he has the last few weeks it's a movie 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:15.689
 to sink into the alps 

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:21.079
 falling yet but by far the most ski resorts read the members' temperatures 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:23.900
 5 to sometimes up to 10 degrees above normal 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.910
 in the south much better and perhaps just a lot more snow 

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:30.819
 it was furious to see if that has now changed 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.760
 in Zandvoort we received a small plus diemen dollar from photos we have 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.920
 got snow plus 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.430
 who will opta in the french alps is the matter 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.850
 but on those little ones it is great to relax and the sun is always full 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.470
 and the polar bear on both moles it is at the moment for 2009 i am fine boot 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.590
 it soon became less 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.530
 then it must remain that you see that it actually looks like they left on this 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:04.329
 photo 

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:07.240
 Early in the morning enough to kill some beautiful people 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.689
 dementia can actually fly very nicely, which is beneath it and that is 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:13.330
 for a green landscape 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.790
 there is nothing to do about this part of the alps the north of tyrol and the so 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.680
 that is the answer 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.270
 very little snow came 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.030
 was drawn on August 18 Mon that is a part of peel reminds us 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.790
 skiwelt wilder kaiser 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.900
 but there it is normal to divide the spring-like landscape well 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.900
 they pinch here and there but were normally not in order 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.300
 with that equals because of the chance that there will be small changes 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.580
 arrive 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.830
 this issue that picks up from west to east 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.820
 And there is now a little bit that can work with the record for a check 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.530
 everywhere on the field 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.160
 the channel was canceled by walcheren snowfall because it kicked out 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.290
 most remarkable finds him 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.230
 but his big toe it is another guess the five maybe ten centimeters 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.380
 more than it really isn't 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.409
 and the responses to the 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:13.779
 and then the stick arrives with soft air from the southwest 

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:17.549
 so it is not completely over with that with that heat 

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:21.199
 we really have to wait until next week 

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:28.309
 danny k from tuesday we already have more than 5 there and that says it 

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:32.229
 to change that internship that leaves me the 

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:35.229
 the summer months are needed 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.150
 now i'm a little further south we are also seeing that 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.700
 low pressure areas at least 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.049
 who try among the other daughter diver is not on yet 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.000
 true and that offers many opportunities for the winter and the near future 

00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:53.959
 not with this market organization law 

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:59.249
 Hereby real ones will soon come in and that will be from mid 

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:02.329
 be able to reach land again next week 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:05.759
 so it is a matter of waiting when that will happen 

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:09.859
 it is a big week so let's not leave too many problems 

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:15.159
 finally Wednesday then that low pressure is on the side of the alps and then go 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:18.589
 I had to deal with the snow mainly on the south side of the Alps 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:24.030
 the lesson car can also take some but Austria yes I am always afraid of 

00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:27.529
 that aegon closes them again what the price is going to fall I have that the past 

00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:30.549
 days already several times I could do 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.549
 had won the election 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:38.589
 just want to see what is representative of the french alps 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:43.739
 You also see that he still agenda the high temperatures to finish the tournament 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.769
 fact after the weekend how much precipitation increases and then the temperature goes too 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.859
 cooked in a declining line under more than normal experiments 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:54.909
 that must be later 3 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:58.930
 now you sometimes see it stopped at the very far away god a purchase 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.099
 barista very very mild weather 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:04.969
 who could water there tila van dale calls the normal value 

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:10.409
 marinus tactic is clear but that falls to the goal but it is there 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:11.919
 no large parts 

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:15.339
 so I am afraid that we are not yet of that green world anp sam
