00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:18.029
 a lot of work promises a lot is a day 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.470
 that we can count on a great position 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.759
 and why not start he can fool you 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.590
 it seems that they found the speed that 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:27.840
 they were missing yesterday what were 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.939
 the changes that also made a lot 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.520
 in the car are the students are more 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.320
 aggressive that cooked us for 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.329
 mainly win a bit of 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.850
 downforce which we were losing 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.240
 a lot and I think we make a good 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.790
 I work today 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.040
 we are a bit away from the red bull and 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.890
 mclaren also but I think tomorrow 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:52.310
 we can fight with a great place and for 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.260
 what not to think about him to try to 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.560
 stop precisely when talking then 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:01.570
 is starting eighth and ninth because 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:04.150
 think about doing it with strategy 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.250
 and I think that obviously strategy 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.540
 with speed I think it's going to be very 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.150
 hard to beat them 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.910
 we will be going to fight them with the 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.310
 strategy and everything can change you 9 of 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.079
 morning 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.420
 as we have seen in many races 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:21.509
 everything can be changed and we can be 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.220
 fighting for victory or suddenly 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.530
 we can be out of the scores 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.829
 that you are so worried about the degradation of 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.509
 the tires a lot on Friday that 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.100
 we tested we had a lot of degradation but 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.220
 we have improved enough for the day of 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.220
 morning 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.350
 and it always goes very well traditionally 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.420
 it's very good 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.070
 I think it has no trick I 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.940
 I think he's a very fast subject with 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:52.810
 many very fast things with a lot of rhythm 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.430
 it's a circuit where 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.100
 you are all the time to the limit not 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:01.079
 it is always very close and circuits 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.079
 from one that I like a lot 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:13.870
 thinking about him is difficult because I have 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.150
 very excited to get to not aclar 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.920
 she enter to kill me but at the end of 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.980
 I want to give you absolutely everything 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.800
 to my team and they have given me all 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.390
 these two years and I want to finish the 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.860
 better way with them do not keep adding up 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.400
 points and keep doing things right 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:33.030
 until the last lap of my friendship 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.030
 to them 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.600
 I believe that with the experience of power 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.710
 improve for example when yesterday I was 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.510
 very very bad with the experience and 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.430
 the knowledge that the 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.069
 learning experience 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.219
 improve and get the team out of harm 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.219
 moment
