started off of an island then came to
Scotland<00:01:04.199> in<00:01:04.290> 1494<00:01:05.180> but<00:01:06.180> Irish<00:01:06.390> whiskeys<00:01:06.720> are

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750

Scotland in 1494 but Irish whiskeys are
fantastic<00:01:07.439> we've<00:01:07.560> got<00:01:07.740> some<00:01:08.009> some<00:01:08.310> great<00:01:08.580> ones

out<00:01:08.909> there<00:01:08.939> with<00:01:09.180> an<00:01:10.140> art<00:01:10.290> portfolio<00:01:10.560> we

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
out there with an art portfolio we

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.029 
out there with an art portfolio we
recently<00:01:11.280> acquired<00:01:11.700> tullamore<00:01:12.450> jus<00:01:12.890> which<00:01:13.890> is

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:14.039 
recently acquired tullamore jus which is

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:15.529 
recently acquired tullamore jus which is
our<00:01:14.189> Irish<00:01:14.520> whiskey<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.000> they<00:01:15.270> were<00:01:15.420> looking

00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:15.539 
our Irish whiskey and they were looking

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:18.350 
our Irish whiskey and they were looking
at<00:01:15.750> building<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.500> distillery<00:01:17.280> in<00:01:17.490> Ireland<00:01:18.240> for

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
at building a distillery in Ireland for

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.910 
at building a distillery in Ireland for
the<00:01:18.450> first<00:01:18.689> time<00:01:18.899> and<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.320> believe<00:01:19.590> its<00:01:19.740> round

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
the first time and I believe its round

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.520 
the first time and I believe its round
about<00:01:20.070> 30<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.490> 40<00:01:20.789> years<00:01:21.110> so<00:01:22.110> that's<00:01:22.200> under

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
about 30 to 40 years so that's under

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.770 
about 30 to 40 years so that's under
underway<00:01:22.860> right<00:01:23.039> now<00:01:23.270> but<00:01:24.270> for<00:01:24.390> me<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.600> main

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
underway right now but for me the main

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.270 
underway right now but for me the main
difference<00:01:25.229> when<00:01:25.350> we<00:01:25.439> talk<00:01:25.590> about<00:01:25.619> Irish<00:01:26.100> and

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
difference when we talk about Irish and

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.070 
difference when we talk about Irish and
Scottish<00:01:26.520> whiskey<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.270> which<00:01:27.690> tends<00:01:27.899> to<00:01:28.020> be

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
Scottish whiskey is I which tends to be

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.260 
Scottish whiskey is I which tends to be
a<00:01:28.110> little<00:01:28.229> bit<00:01:28.350> lighter<00:01:28.619> now<00:01:29.399> the<00:01:29.789> reason<00:01:29.970> for

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
a little bit lighter now the reason for

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.389 
a little bit lighter now the reason for
that<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:30.569> predominately<00:01:31.319> in<00:01:31.409> Ireland<00:01:31.920> they

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.399 
that is predominately in Ireland they

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:34.580 
that is predominately in Ireland they
will<00:01:32.549> triple<00:01:32.940> the<00:01:32.970> still<00:01:33.330> there<00:01:33.690> the<00:01:34.259> whiskey

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
will triple the still there the whiskey

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.350 
will triple the still there the whiskey
whereas<00:01:35.130> in<00:01:35.250> Scotland<00:01:35.700> we<00:01:36.000> doubled<00:01:36.330> the

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
whereas in Scotland we doubled the

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.149 
whereas in Scotland we doubled the
stellar<00:01:36.659> so<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.259> more<00:01:37.409> times<00:01:37.649> you<00:01:37.740> distill

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
stellar so the more times you distill

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.029 
stellar so the more times you distill
something<00:01:38.580> the<00:01:38.880> smoother<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.390> becomes<00:01:40.039> also

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:41.039 
something the smoother it becomes also

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:43.130 
something the smoother it becomes also
Irish<00:01:41.490> tend<00:01:41.789> not<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.179> use<00:01:42.209> any<00:01:42.330> Pete<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.080> the

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
Irish tend not to use any Pete and the

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.399 
Irish tend not to use any Pete and the
drying<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.619> their<00:01:43.740> barley<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.759> get<00:01:44.850> some

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
drying of their barley so you get some

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:47.660 
drying of their barley so you get some
Scotch<00:01:46.409> whiskies<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:46.950> are<00:01:47.009> very<00:01:47.159> smoky

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
Scotch whiskies that are very smoky

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.609 
Scotch whiskies that are very smoky
glenfiddich<00:01:48.539> isn't<00:01:48.780> one<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:48.929> them<00:01:49.080> but<00:01:49.319> if<00:01:49.470> we

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
glenfiddich isn't one of them but if we

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.410 
glenfiddich isn't one of them but if we
look<00:01:49.649> towards<00:01:50.190> the<00:01:50.369> western<00:01:51.090> side<00:01:51.360> of

look towards the western side of

Scotland particular over in Isla the

Scotland particular over in Isla the
traditional<00:01:54.450> ones<00:01:54.630> they<00:01:54.810> are<00:01:54.840> going<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.140> be

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
traditional ones they are going to be

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.899 
traditional ones they are going to be
very<00:01:55.259> smoky<00:01:55.830> in<00:01:55.950> that's<00:01:56.159> because<00:01:56.399> they<00:01:56.520> use<00:01:56.640> a

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
very smoky in that's because they use a

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.969 
very smoky in that's because they use a
lot<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.209> peat<00:01:57.479> in<00:01:57.720> the<00:01:58.110> drying<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.619> barley

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
lot of peat in the drying of the barley

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.279 
lot of peat in the drying of the barley
predominantly<00:01:59.970> Irish<00:02:00.149> whiskey's<00:02:00.810> won't<00:02:01.110> use

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
predominantly Irish whiskey's won't use

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:03.109 
predominantly Irish whiskey's won't use
any<00:02:01.500> Pete<00:02:01.830> in<00:02:02.069> the<00:02:02.220> drying<00:02:02.399> of<00:02:02.550> the<00:02:02.610> barley<00:02:02.879> so

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
any Pete in the drying of the barley so

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.940 
any Pete in the drying of the barley so
you<00:02:03.209> won't<00:02:03.330> get<00:02:03.539> that<00:02:03.690> smoky<00:02:04.170> characteristic

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
you won't get that smoky characteristic

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.770 
you won't get that smoky characteristic
coming<00:02:05.190> through<00:02:05.399> Keats<00:02:05.700> say<00:02:05.970> it's<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.450> fuel

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
coming through Keats say it's a fuel

source<00:02:06.989> that<00:02:07.259> we<00:02:07.349> used<00:02:07.590> in<00:02:07.739> Scotland<00:02:08.310> back<00:02:09.209> in

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
source that we used in Scotland back in

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.759 
source that we used in Scotland back in
the<00:02:09.509> day<00:02:09.660> I<00:02:09.690> mean<00:02:09.899> we<00:02:10.019> didn't<00:02:10.229> have<00:02:10.319> gas<00:02:10.530> we

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
the day I mean we didn't have gas we

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:12.530 
the day I mean we didn't have gas we
didn't<00:02:10.979> have<00:02:11.099> coal<00:02:11.400> so<00:02:11.970> what<00:02:12.090> we<00:02:12.180> used<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.360> do

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
didn't have coal so what we used to do

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.150 
didn't have coal so what we used to do
is<00:02:12.720> just<00:02:12.750> basically<00:02:13.230> dig<00:02:13.470> up<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.739> earth<00:02:13.890> and

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
is just basically dig up the earth and

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.960 
is just basically dig up the earth and
Pete<00:02:15.150> is<00:02:15.500> it's<00:02:16.500> basically<00:02:16.800> compost<00:02:17.550> under<00:02:17.849> the

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
Pete is it's basically compost under the

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.160 
Pete is it's basically compost under the
ground<00:02:18.120> that's<00:02:18.360> been<00:02:18.540> there<00:02:18.690> for<00:02:18.840> hundreds<00:02:19.140> of

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
ground that's been there for hundreds of

ground that's been there for hundreds of
years<00:02:19.319> Heather<00:02:19.650> soil<00:02:20.069> everything<00:02:20.670> that's

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
years Heather soil everything that's

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.490 
years Heather soil everything that's
that's<00:02:21.000> been<00:02:21.180> there<00:02:21.330> so<00:02:21.420> we<00:02:21.510> dig<00:02:21.720> it<00:02:21.810> up<00:02:21.870> put<00:02:22.470> it

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
that's been there so we dig it up put it

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.649 
that's been there so we dig it up put it
to<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.709> side<00:02:22.800> we<00:02:23.160> let<00:02:23.370> it<00:02:23.550> dry<00:02:23.879> and<00:02:24.120> then<00:02:24.180> we

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
to the side we let it dry and then we

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:26.839 
to the side we let it dry and then we
put<00:02:24.840> it<00:02:24.930> into<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.200> fire<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:26.400> what<00:02:26.580> we<00:02:26.670> do<00:02:26.819> is

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
put it into the fire and what we do is
