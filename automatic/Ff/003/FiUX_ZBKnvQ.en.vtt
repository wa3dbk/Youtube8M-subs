00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.380
Hello I am Maiah and this is called Visto Bueno

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.660
I'm back, I'm back

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.440
And all of this is "out"

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.610
One of the risks of buying the latest fashion "scream"

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.220
Is that in a couple of weeks nothing will be "in" anymore

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.450
To give you an example please take a look at this picture

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.180
When I bought these glasses I swore they were the best sunglasses in the whole world

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:30.210
And the scarf

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.490
You're doing it great.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.240
You're doing it really great, Maiah from the past

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.550
You're doing it reaaaaaally great.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.430
The wonderful thing is essential clothes are timeless

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.550
You can't wear all your life the same old little black dress

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.300
Lady, please, take off that dress!

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.230
Let it go.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.110
Let it go...

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.880
Clothing should fit your needs and your age

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.000
But it is useless to have a million essential clothes if you don't look good wearing them.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.590
If you follow the next tips you'll stretch the life of each one of those essential pieces

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.370
And you'll save some money

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.820
And all we need to save money

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:09.300
All of us

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.440
Today we'll learn to choose the ten essential clothes for you

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.540
THE ESSENTIAL TEN

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.790
BLACK DRESS

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.970
How many times have we heard about the same old black dress?

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.690
3,558,857,34 times

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:26.680
And believe me

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.980
Experts will never stop saying it

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.990
But they are right, the black dress is essential

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.090
There are some details that you should consider

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.930
So you can use your dress many times and do not look "repeated"

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.740
The dress should be symmetrical

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.850
If we want this black dress among our essentials forget the asymmetrical ones

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.620
Those with sleeves

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.720
Those with a tail from a side

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.730
The asymmetrical dresses are easier to remember

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.010
And they are usually more complicated to remix with other clothes

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.280
Avoid details like sequins, rhinestones and shiny stuff

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.380
Because this would limit your dress only to the night

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.020
If your body is not the most stylish in the world

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.040
Avoid spandex!

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.140
AVOID SPANDEX!

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.450
These dresses show each of your michelins.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.950
Choose a dress with an intermediate length

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.350
Neither too long nor too short

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.190
You will stretch it's scope in time

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.010
I mean, you can use it at cocktails

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.410
A relaxed Sunday

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.810
A movie night

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:19.420
Or a date

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.280
WHITE SHIRT

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.030
Just like the dress

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.600
Avoid details, rhinestones, thingy, flowers, etc

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.490
If not everyone will know it's the same shirt

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.890
The same shirt!

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.560
The same! The same!

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.970
Take it off!

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.230
The golden rule is:

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.300
Simple is always better

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.280
Choose loose shirts and avoid the super short and tight ones

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.740
You don't look cool with that shirt, you know?

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.230
That same shirt you can wear with shorts and flats on a Sunday out

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.070
You can easily turn into a night look

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.580
SKIRT

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.340
Although some girls think that perhaps a skirt is too boring

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.790
Going to college with a skirt? Mmmm

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.960
No!

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.840
The skirt is a very versatile piece

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.090
You can include it in a casual look by combining it with a shirt and sneakers

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.910
The golden rule is that mini-skirts should be longer than wide

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.150
This is not the size of a miniskirt!

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.200
This is not!

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.830
This is a bandana!

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:10.240
Bandana!

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.500
Mini-skirt!

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.110
Bandana!

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.880
Mini-skirt!

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:12.370
Bandana!

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.830
Mini-skirt!

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.010
This means that the width of a hip determine the length of the skirt

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.090
The visual effect of a skirt that is too short

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:20.940
Is that hips are going to look wider

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.560
And who wants to look wider? Nobody!

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:23.000
Bandana!

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.420
Mini-skirt!

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.850
Bandana!

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:24.260
Mini-skirt!

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.700
Bandana!

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.230
Mini-skirt!

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.330
Bandana, skirt, bandana, skirt, bandana, skirt, bandana, skirt, bandana, skirt

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.210
I work out in the meantime

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.310
JEAN

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:33.190
A big topic!

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.190
So big that I already made an episode about it

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.910
Click here and learn!

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.770
Overall I have to say that should be dark

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.870
Without any details or tidbits

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.070
And it must fit perfectly to your body type as well

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.170
MAXI BAG

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.930
Yeap, that yellow maxi bag is awesome!

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.030
And will perfectly complement your look

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.180
But if you have no money to buy other maxi bag

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.820
Not very smart buying this color!

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.270
Purchase a neutral color maxi bag

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.580
WHICH ARE THE NEUTRAL COLORS?

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.580
Neutral colors are your best friends

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.680
They combine with vibrant colors

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.510
And among each other

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.140
Black, Brown, Camel, Beige, Blue, Gray...

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.930
I forgot the colors

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.830
BLAZER

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.570
It may be black, dark blue or gray

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:24.790
A blazer is vital

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:30.930
Moreover, recently it has become an essential clothing to look stylish

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:32.280
I'm going to say

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.650
Keep it simple

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.460
Simple is always better

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.500
Leave bright colors and prints to shirts and blouses that will complement your essential ones

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.600
The most important detail is that the blazer should perfectly cover your back

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.200
And it should be accordingly to your height

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.300
If you are short do not use it very long

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.670
Because you'll look shrunken

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.770
PUMPS / STILETTOS

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.950
Select a not so high heel

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.770
Remember

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.870
Simple is always better

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.930
Simple... is... always... better

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:00.890
CARDIGAN

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.890
Black gray and camel
My favorite

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:04.990
I do recommend the loose ones

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.560
They give that fresh feeling

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.160
Rico!

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.690
T SHIRT

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:12.990
Perfect for everyday

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.590
Good, nice and cheap

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.470
Give me twelve!

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:17.930
But keep it white

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:23.150
OMG! That girl in that soiled t-shirt if she have that soiled t-shit how she will have her as#%$#!

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:24.650
FLATS

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.420
Slippers can save the day

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.520
Keep them clean and shaped

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.490
When you turn a cute, beautiful, delicate and feminine shoe into a "bojote"

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.200
You must throwing it away

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.470
Don't be filthy, that seems like a deformed tamale!

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:40.040
You have to throw the shoe

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.890
That's a "bojote"

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.420
Throw away that "bojote", mija!

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.340
ESSENTIAL CLOTHES ARE IN NEUTRAL COLORS

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:50.100
Come on Maiah! 10 little pieces all neutral? I need color! That's not for me!

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.800
Are you sure?

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.900
Look what you can do with these pieces!

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.180
ESSENTIALS

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:12.190
Believe it or not, to look nice every day more than money you need is intelligence

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.620
We all like to have a new dress every day

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.950
But neither the pocket of a princess endure so much pressure

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.670
Also, having many clothes not guarantee that all fit you ok!

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:27.200
It's preferable to have a dress that fits you perfect than ten that doesn't

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.740
To make it look different each time you have this video!

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:38.730

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.720
Not! Anything for her! Not even water!

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:45.030
