to live that because this thing is
pretty<00:02:02.649> bulky<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:04.270> I<00:02:04.659> was<00:02:04.779> kind<00:02:04.929> of<00:02:05.049> hoping

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:05.109 
pretty bulky and I was kind of hoping

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:06.839

that<00:02:05.499> would<00:02:05.649> do<00:02:05.740> a<00:02:05.770> little<00:02:06.009> more<00:02:06.219> to<00:02:06.399> him<00:02:06.549> but

00:02:06.839 --> 00:02:06.849 
that would do a little more to him but

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:11.429 
that would do a little more to him but
you<00:02:07.599> know<00:02:07.719> it's<00:02:08.200> meant<00:02:08.739> to<00:02:08.890> be<00:02:08.920> used<00:02:09.340> as<00:02:10.439> look

00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:11.439 
you know it's meant to be used as look

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:14.040 
you know it's meant to be used as look
after<00:02:11.920> status<00:02:12.489> has<00:02:12.640> been<00:02:12.670> inflicted<00:02:13.299> and

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
after status has been inflicted and

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.540 
after status has been inflicted and
yeah<00:02:14.170> but<00:02:14.500> anyway<00:02:14.830> he<00:02:15.040> has<00:02:15.160> no<00:02:15.310> status

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
yeah but anyway he has no status

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.130 
yeah but anyway he has no status
inflicted<00:02:16.090> so<00:02:16.240> it's<00:02:16.390> going<00:02:16.480> to<00:02:16.570> kind<00:02:16.720> of<00:02:16.840> suck

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140
