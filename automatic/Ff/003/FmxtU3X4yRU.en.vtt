00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
this is my review of precision precision

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.349 
this is my review of precision precision
engineered<00:00:03.899> whey<00:00:04.380> isolates<00:00:05.069> I<00:00:05.400> already

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
engineered whey isolates I already

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.379 
engineered whey isolates I already
reviewed<00:00:06.569> previously<00:00:07.109> the<00:00:08.210> regular<00:00:09.210> whey

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
reviewed previously the regular whey

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.180 
reviewed previously the regular whey
protein<00:00:09.900> both<00:00:10.590> are<00:00:10.860> from<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.719> vitamin<00:00:12.719> world

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.190 
protein both are from the vitamin world

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.160 
protein both are from the vitamin world
this<00:00:14.190> one<00:00:14.400> here<00:00:14.700> only<00:00:15.210> gave<00:00:15.360> me<00:00:15.389> though<00:00:15.630> 18

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
this one here only gave me though 18

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.279 
this one here only gave me though 18
grams<00:00:16.410> of<00:00:16.590> protein<00:00:16.980> this<00:00:17.970> one<00:00:18.240> gives<00:00:19.020> me<00:00:19.140> I

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
grams of protein this one gives me I

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.480 
grams of protein this one gives me I
think<00:00:19.789> closer<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:21.029> 30<00:00:21.619> yeah<00:00:22.619> 30<00:00:22.650> grams<00:00:23.310> of

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
think closer to 30 yeah 30 grams of

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.120 
think closer to 30 yeah 30 grams of
protein<00:00:23.820> so<00:00:23.850> more<00:00:24.150> protein<00:00:24.600> one<00:00:25.529> thing<00:00:25.830> I

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
protein so more protein one thing I

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.670 
protein so more protein one thing I
really<00:00:27.029> like<00:00:27.240> this<00:00:27.449> one<00:00:27.630> previously<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.650> you

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
really like this one previously and you

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.800 
really like this one previously and you
can<00:00:28.890> check<00:00:29.070> that<00:00:29.099> review<00:00:29.580> it<00:00:30.210> tastes<00:00:30.599> really

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
can check that review it tastes really

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.020 
can check that review it tastes really
good<00:00:31.109> but<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.769> wanted<00:00:32.070> more<00:00:32.219> protein<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:32.790> wanted

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
good but I wanted more protein I wanted

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.750 
good but I wanted more protein I wanted
something<00:00:33.239> that<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:34.469> maybe<00:00:34.800> would<00:00:35.070> help<00:00:35.579> me

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
something that that maybe would help me

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.680 
something that that maybe would help me
through<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.480> night<00:00:37.100> okay<00:00:38.210> make<00:00:39.210> sure<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.450> get

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
you know nut protein one thing that put

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.170 
you know nut protein one thing that put
me<00:00:42.840> off<00:00:42.989> about<00:00:43.290> this<00:00:43.530> product<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.610> only<00:00:44.969> thing

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
product is the flavor with the previous

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.889 
product is the flavor with the previous
way<00:00:50.160> isolate<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.940> creamy<00:00:51.210> vanilla<00:00:51.449> flavor

you know false advertising in that sense

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.910 
you know false advertising in that sense
and<00:01:18.450> if<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:18.990> drink<00:01:19.200> with<00:01:19.350> me<00:01:19.530> which<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:19.770> just

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
and if you drink with me which is just

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.190 
and if you drink with me which is just
straight-up<00:01:20.340> water<00:01:22.369> it's<00:01:23.369> not<00:01:23.580> as<00:01:24.200> as

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
straight-up water it's not as as

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.980 
straight-up water it's not as as
fulfilling<00:01:25.830> or<00:01:26.070> as<00:01:26.189> good<00:01:26.430> as<00:01:26.780> the<00:01:27.780> previous

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
fulfilling or as good as the previous

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.010 
fulfilling or as good as the previous
one<00:01:28.320> was<00:01:28.530> one<00:01:29.430> thing<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.700> notice<00:01:29.939> -<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.840> get

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
one was one thing to notice - you get

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.780 
one was one thing to notice - you get
more<00:01:31.140> protein<00:01:31.380> but<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.890> scoops<00:01:32.189> also<00:01:32.579> bigger

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
more protein but the scoops also bigger

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.730 
more protein but the scoops also bigger
so<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:34.200> don't<00:01:35.009> know<00:01:35.100> like<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:36.320> 35-grand<00:01:37.320> scoop

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
so I don't know like a 35-grand scoop

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.760 
so I don't know like a 35-grand scoop
and<00:01:37.979> like<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.100> 20<00:01:38.520> something<00:01:38.700> gram<00:01:39.630> scoop<00:01:40.049> maybe

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
and like a 20 something gram scoop maybe

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:41.899 
and like a 20 something gram scoop maybe
I<00:01:40.890> could<00:01:41.070> have<00:01:41.159> just<00:01:41.310> stuck<00:01:41.520> with<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.850> and

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
I could have just stuck with that and

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.510 
I could have just stuck with that and
done<00:01:42.210> more<00:01:42.390> scoops<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.290> be<00:01:44.159> just<00:01:44.369> a

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
done more scoops of it and be just a

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.120 
done more scoops of it and be just a
satisfied<00:01:45.030> or<00:01:45.180> as<00:01:45.299> fulfilled<00:01:45.720> but<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.890> makes

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
satisfied or as fulfilled but it makes

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.770 
satisfied or as fulfilled but it makes
this<00:01:47.280> pretty<00:01:47.490> much<00:01:47.729> just<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.090> same<00:01:48.299> just<00:01:48.659> as

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
this pretty much just the same just as

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.289 
this pretty much just the same just as
easily<00:01:49.460> actually<00:01:50.460> got<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.610> good<00:01:50.820> deal<00:01:50.970> on<00:01:51.030> this

$35<00:02:02.820> same<00:02:03.810> as<00:02:04.079> this<00:02:04.740> $22<00:02:05.719> protein

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
$35 same as this $22 protein

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.309 
$35 same as this $22 protein
I<00:02:07.340> got<00:02:07.549> it<00:02:07.700> but<00:02:08.360> it<00:02:08.479> mixes<00:02:09.369> what<00:02:10.369> is<00:02:10.520> it
