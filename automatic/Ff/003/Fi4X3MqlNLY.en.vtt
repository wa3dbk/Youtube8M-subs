the screen as the FPS is goes to the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.420 
the screen as the FPS is goes to the
roof<00:01:36.470> because<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.619> does<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.070> really<00:01:38.250> good<00:01:38.369> job

my controller doesn't respond while I'm
recording<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.960> hope<00:01:54.960> not

there<00:01:57.830> we<00:01:58.070> go<00:01:59.080> all<00:02:00.080> right<00:02:00.170> so<00:02:00.590> let's<00:02:01.010> go<00:02:01.310> ahead

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 
there we go all right so let's go ahead

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.720 
there we go all right so let's go ahead
and<00:02:01.640> continue<00:02:02.150> my<00:02:02.630> adventure<00:02:03.050> and<00:02:04.010> selecting

and continue my adventure and selecting

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.770 
and continue my adventure and selecting
my<00:02:04.850> game<00:02:05.090> do<00:02:05.810> we<00:02:06.050> do<00:02:06.520> and<00:02:07.540> you'll<00:02:08.540> see<00:02:08.690> how

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
my game do we do and you'll see how

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.990 
my game do we do and you'll see how
painful<00:02:09.229> it<00:02:09.350> is<00:02:09.380> to<00:02:09.500> play<00:02:09.830> but<00:02:10.399> is<00:02:10.670> actually

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
painful it is to play but is actually

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.780 
painful it is to play but is actually
stable<00:02:11.900> enough<00:02:12.110> to<00:02:12.170> play<00:02:12.530> surprisingly<00:02:13.310> so

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.280 

the<00:02:19.790> point<00:02:19.970> of<00:02:20.090> this<00:02:20.150> video<00:02:20.540> is<00:02:20.780> not<00:02:20.810> to

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
the point of this video is not to

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.110

less just to show how how good this

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.080 
less just to show how how good this
works<00:02:34.400> with<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:35.440> actual<00:02:36.440> emulator<00:02:36.980> and<00:02:37.459> to

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
works with the actual emulator and to

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.530 
works with the actual emulator and to
show<00:02:39.050> you<00:02:39.110> exactly<00:02:39.820> what<00:02:40.820> you<00:02:40.850> can<00:02:41.000> expect<00:02:41.360> if

play it right now I do know that this

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.160 
play it right now I do know that this
emulator<00:02:46.190> is<00:02:46.640> still<00:02:47.270> under<00:02:47.480> development<00:02:47.630> and

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
emulator is still under development and

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.630 
emulator is still under development and
they've<00:02:48.410> got<00:02:48.470> a<00:02:48.620> new<00:02:48.800> update<00:02:48.980> coming<00:02:49.370> pretty

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
soon they keep talking about and has it

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.370 
soon they keep talking about and has it
come<00:02:54.140> out<00:02:54.290> quite<00:02:54.500> yet<00:02:55.180> but<00:02:56.180> the<00:02:56.930> really<00:02:57.110> shitty

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
come out quite yet but the really shitty

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.270 
come out quite yet but the really shitty
thing<00:02:57.500> is<00:02:57.740> that<00:02:58.570> being<00:02:59.570> a<00:02:59.690> ps2<00:03:00.260> emulator<00:03:00.440> the

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
thing is that being a ps2 emulator the

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.920 
thing is that being a ps2 emulator the
the<00:03:01.610> main<00:03:01.850> games<00:03:02.180> that<00:03:02.420> people<00:03:02.540> have<00:03:02.780> been

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
the main games that people have been

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.199 
the main games that people have been
perfecting<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:03.739> emulator<00:03:04.130> for<00:03:04.209> final

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
perfecting the emulator for final

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.729 
perfecting the emulator for final
fantasy<00:03:05.660> games<00:03:05.950> which<00:03:06.950> are<00:03:07.070> garbage<00:03:07.459> and<00:03:08.739> you

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
fantasy games which are garbage and you

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.470 
fantasy games which are garbage and you
know<00:03:09.830> i<00:03:09.860> mean<00:03:10.010> really<00:03:10.220> besides<00:03:10.820> that<00:03:11.150> you<00:03:11.360> know

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
know i mean really besides that you know

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.820 
know i mean really besides that you know
pretty<00:03:11.750> much<00:03:11.780> as<00:03:11.989> the<00:03:12.110> final<00:03:12.320> fantasy<00:03:12.650> games

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
pretty much as the final fantasy games

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.880 
pretty much as the final fantasy games
so<00:03:13.720> unfortunately<00:03:14.720> and<00:03:15.140> the<00:03:15.470> Japanese

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
so unfortunately and the Japanese

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.460 
so unfortunately and the Japanese
imports<00:03:16.340> so<00:03:17.239> unfortunately<00:03:17.810> we<00:03:17.900> have<00:03:18.260> not

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
imports so unfortunately we have not

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.470 
imports so unfortunately we have not
been<00:03:18.769> seeing<00:03:19.130> much<00:03:19.310> action<00:03:19.340> in<00:03:19.940> terms<00:03:20.360> of

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
been seeing much action in terms of

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.310 
been seeing much action in terms of
developing<00:03:20.900> this<00:03:21.080> for<00:03:22.450> you<00:03:23.450> know<00:03:23.540> like<00:03:23.690> decent

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
developing this for you know like decent

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.080 
developing this for you know like decent
games<00:03:24.680> but<00:03:25.130> the<00:03:25.250> ps2<00:03:25.610> didn't<00:03:25.790> really<00:03:25.940> have

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
games but the ps2 didn't really have

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.390 
games but the ps2 didn't really have
many<00:03:26.209> decent<00:03:26.510> games<00:03:26.840> so<00:03:27.170> I<00:03:27.380> guess<00:03:28.130> this<00:03:28.280> is

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
many decent games so I guess this is

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.080 
many decent games so I guess this is
more<00:03:28.610> to<00:03:28.670> the<00:03:28.760> point<00:03:28.959> what<00:03:29.959> should<00:03:30.140> I<00:03:30.230> expect

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
more to the point what should I expect

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.820 
more to the point what should I expect
you'll<00:03:32.090> notice<00:03:32.360> the<00:03:32.540> animation<00:03:33.049> is<00:03:33.170> very<00:03:33.440> slow

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
you'll notice the animation is very slow

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.320 
you'll notice the animation is very slow
but<00:03:34.459> the<00:03:34.670> the<00:03:35.600> actual<00:03:35.720> gameplay<00:03:36.140> is<00:03:37.330> standard

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
but the the actual gameplay is standard

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.490 
but the the actual gameplay is standard
standard<00:03:38.690> time<00:03:39.110> assist<00:03:39.500> you<00:03:39.709> get<00:03:40.640> maybe<00:03:40.850> 30<00:03:41.500> 20

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
standard time assist you get maybe 30 20

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.670 
standard time assist you get maybe 30 20
FPS<00:03:42.830> when<00:03:43.670> you're<00:03:43.790> moving<00:03:44.110> which<00:03:45.110> if<00:03:45.410> you<00:03:45.500> use

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
FPS when you're moving which if you use

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.160 
FPS when you're moving which if you use
auto<00:03:45.890> frame<00:03:46.250> skipper<00:03:46.700> it'll<00:03:47.480> actually<00:03:47.660> skip

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
auto frame skipper it'll actually skip

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.630 
auto frame skipper it'll actually skip
those<00:03:48.320> frames<00:03:48.680> and<00:03:48.920> you'll<00:03:49.040> play<00:03:49.220> at<00:03:49.340> a<00:03:49.370> normal

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
those frames and you'll play at a normal

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:50.949 
those frames and you'll play at a normal
speed<00:03:49.790> you<00:03:50.120> just<00:03:50.269> won't<00:03:50.360> see<00:03:50.510> that<00:03:50.630> you<00:03:50.810> won't

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
speed you just won't see that you won't

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:52.900 
speed you just won't see that you won't
see<00:03:51.080> all<00:03:51.170> the<00:03:51.290> frames<00:03:51.530> obviously<00:03:52.070> so<00:03:52.730> it<00:03:52.790> will

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
see all the frames obviously so it will

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.190 
see all the frames obviously so it will
be<00:03:52.940> a<00:03:53.030> smooth<00:03:53.269> animation<00:03:53.810> you<00:03:53.900> can<00:03:53.930> see<00:03:54.110> I'm

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
be a smooth animation you can see I'm

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.199 
be a smooth animation you can see I'm
getting<00:03:54.470> down<00:03:54.590> here<00:03:54.920> just<00:03:55.130> kind<00:03:55.340> of<00:03:55.370> shutting

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
getting down here just kind of shutting

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.539 
getting down here just kind of shutting
off<00:03:56.299> doing<00:03:56.630> my<00:03:56.750> own<00:03:56.780> thing<00:03:56.900> and<00:03:57.410> may<00:03:58.190> seem<00:03:58.400> like

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
off doing my own thing and may seem like

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:01.360 
off doing my own thing and may seem like
it's<00:03:58.670> a<00:03:58.760> little<00:03:59.030> slow<00:03:59.420> but<00:03:59.620> in<00:04:00.620> reality<00:04:00.890> it's

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
it's a little slow but in reality it's

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:02.830 
it's a little slow but in reality it's
probably<00:04:01.730> just<00:04:01.940> a<00:04:02.060> wee<00:04:02.209> a<00:04:02.239> little<00:04:02.450> bit<00:04:02.570> slower

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
probably just a wee a little bit slower

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.630 
probably just a wee a little bit slower
than<00:04:03.049> how<00:04:03.530> fast<00:04:03.769> I<00:04:03.920> be<00:04:04.040> going<00:04:04.280> if<00:04:04.400> I<00:04:04.490> was

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
than how fast I be going if I was

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.540 
than how fast I be going if I was
playing<00:04:04.730> the<00:04:05.000> regular<00:04:05.810> version

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.870 
stop to that ah guess I should just damn
well<00:04:26.050> I<00:04:26.320> guess<00:04:26.770> no<00:04:26.950> more<00:04:27.070> reviewing<00:04:27.550> of<00:04:27.670> that

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
well I guess no more reviewing of that

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.470 
well I guess no more reviewing of that
because<00:04:29.070> that's<00:04:30.070> kind<00:04:30.220> of<00:04:30.640> it<00:04:31.360> was

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
because that's kind of it was

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.380 
because that's kind of it was
pretty<00:04:31.630> fun<00:04:31.870> so<00:04:32.760> that's<00:04:33.760> what<00:04:33.910> you<00:04:34.000> can<00:04:34.120> expect

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
pretty fun so that's what you can expect

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.230 
pretty fun so that's what you can expect
if<00:04:34.570> you<00:04:34.690> try<00:04:34.870> to<00:04:34.930> emulate<00:04:35.640> ps2<00:04:36.640> on<00:04:37.000> your

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
if you try to emulate ps2 on your

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.110 
if you try to emulate ps2 on your
computer<00:04:37.890> now<00:04:38.890> I<00:04:38.920> have<00:04:39.340> clocked<00:04:39.640> about<00:04:39.910> two

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
computer now I have clocked about two

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.390 
computer now I have clocked about two
hours<00:04:40.270> of<00:04:40.540> gameplay<00:04:40.810> into<00:04:41.290> this<00:04:41.410> thing<00:04:41.710> which

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
hours of gameplay into this thing which

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.980 
hours of gameplay into this thing which
is<00:04:42.430> sufficient<00:04:43.120> enough<00:04:43.150> to<00:04:43.360> get<00:04:43.570> past<00:04:43.600> the

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
is sufficient enough to get past the

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.920 
is sufficient enough to get past the
first<00:04:44.170> level<00:04:44.700> area<00:04:45.700> thing<00:04:47.070> so<00:04:48.810> give<00:04:49.810> me<00:04:49.840> a

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
first level area thing so give me a

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.300 
first level area thing so give me a
second<00:04:50.230> here<00:04:50.260> let<00:04:50.470> me<00:04:50.530> see<00:04:50.560> if<00:04:50.740> I<00:04:50.800> can't<00:04:50.980> pop<00:04:51.160> it

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
second here let me see if I can't pop it

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:58.260 
second here let me see if I can't pop it
back<00:04:51.340> open<00:04:51.760> again<00:04:56.700> we'll<00:04:57.700> see<00:04:57.880> if<00:04:57.970> it<00:04:58.090> can't

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
back open again we'll see if it can't

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.810 
back open again we'll see if it can't
work<00:04:58.420> one<00:04:58.630> more<00:04:58.780> time<00:04:58.990> we'll<00:04:59.680> do<00:04:59.830> it<00:04:59.920> a<00:04:59.980> shot<00:05:00.190> I

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.200 

think<00:05:03.820> that's<00:05:04.000> correct<00:05:04.480> in<00:05:04.960> the<00:05:05.260> frame<00:05:06.120> get<00:05:07.120> in

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
think that's correct in the frame get in

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.310 
think that's correct in the frame get in
there<00:05:07.390> and<00:05:09.390> save<00:05:10.390> states<00:05:10.660> are<00:05:10.840> really<00:05:11.200> useful

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
there and save states are really useful

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.850 
there and save states are really useful
because<00:05:11.890> you<00:05:12.040> can<00:05:12.190> just<00:05:12.870> zip<00:05:13.870> right<00:05:14.350> off<00:05:14.590> to

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
because you can just zip right off to

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.100 
because you can just zip right off to
where<00:05:15.040> you're<00:05:15.070> gone<00:05:15.430> when<00:05:16.360> you<00:05:16.540> have<00:05:16.930> the

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
where you're gone when you have the

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.620 
where you're gone when you have the
screen<00:05:17.380> highlighted<00:05:17.890> all<00:05:18.880> right<00:05:19.000> there<00:05:19.419> we<00:05:19.510> go

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:19.630 
screen highlighted all right there we go

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.050 
screen highlighted all right there we go
so<00:05:20.080> we're<00:05:20.230> back<00:05:20.350> oh<00:05:20.620> I<00:05:21.430> don't<00:05:21.669> want<00:05:21.790> to<00:05:21.850> talk<00:05:21.880> to

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:13.979 
notice there are moments of clarity when

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:17.930 
notice there are moments of clarity when
the<00:06:14.220> all<00:06:15.180> the<00:06:15.389> frames<00:06:15.660> align<00:06:16.320> and<00:06:16.680> the<00:06:17.460> planets

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 
the all the frames align and the planets

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.700 
the all the frames align and the planets
and<00:06:18.950> then<00:06:19.950> it<00:06:20.340> crashes<00:06:21.350> what<00:06:22.350> is<00:06:22.500> the<00:06:22.560> most

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:22.710 
and then it crashes what is the most

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.770 
and then it crashes what is the most
crashing<00:06:23.100> I've<00:06:23.190> ever<00:06:23.370> had<00:06:23.550> maybe<00:06:24.539> I<00:06:24.600> just

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:24.780 
crashing I've ever had maybe I just

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.270 
crashing I've ever had maybe I just
can't<00:06:24.960> do<00:06:25.050> this<00:06:25.169> with<00:06:25.350> Camtasia<00:06:25.770> or<00:06:25.979> something

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280
