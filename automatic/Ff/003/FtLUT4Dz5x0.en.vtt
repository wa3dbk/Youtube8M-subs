00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
to be I actually came across this

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.800 
to be I actually came across this
website<00:02:14.680> a<00:02:14.950> while<00:02:15.220> ago<00:02:15.489> and<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:16.420> prices<00:02:16.690> were

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
website a while ago and the prices were

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.000 
website a while ago and the prices were
good<00:02:16.989> and<00:02:17.140> i<00:02:17.230> figured<00:02:17.530> i<00:02:17.620> would<00:02:17.769> give<00:02:17.890> it<00:02:17.920> a

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
good and i figured i would give it a

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.520 
good and i figured i would give it a
shot<00:02:18.190> and<00:02:18.430> i'm<00:02:19.330> quite<00:02:19.599> happy<00:02:19.780> with<00:02:20.200> the

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
shot and i'm quite happy with the

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.839 
shot and i'm quite happy with the
results<00:02:21.180> if<00:02:22.180> you<00:02:22.980> have<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.250> care<00:02:24.459> normally

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
results if you have the care normally

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:26.070 
results if you have the care normally
and<00:02:25.060> you're<00:02:25.180> getting<00:02:25.300> these<00:02:25.510> for<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.870> length

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
and you're getting these for the length

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.610 
and you're getting these for the length
i<00:02:26.290> would<00:02:26.560> suggest<00:02:26.769> getting<00:02:27.310> two<00:02:27.670> sets<00:02:27.700> and<00:02:28.620> if

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
i would suggest getting two sets and if

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.410 
i would suggest getting two sets and if
you<00:02:30.569> like<00:02:31.569> me<00:02:31.900> i<00:02:32.200> have<00:02:33.069> one<00:02:33.310> set<00:02:33.519> in<00:02:33.640> but<00:02:34.030> i

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
you like me i have one set in but i

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.690 
you like me i have one set in but i
guess<00:02:35.049> it<00:02:35.170> really<00:02:35.260> depends<00:02:35.620> on<00:02:35.830> how<00:02:35.890> thin<00:02:36.549> or

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
guess it really depends on how thin or

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.479 
guess it really depends on how thin or
thick<00:02:36.730> your<00:02:37.030> hair<00:02:37.209> is<00:02:37.390> but<00:02:38.230> usually<00:02:39.069> i<00:02:39.099> do<00:02:39.220> tend
