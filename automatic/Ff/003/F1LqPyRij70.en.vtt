00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:48.879
 with the sb tower to recharge it and not 3 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:51.399
 we find a jack to connect the 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:54.129
 in-house music that is very water-based 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:57.969
 transfer music from any 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:01:00.369
 device house to the reader is a 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:04.190
 simple lanyard strap to carry it 

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:12.650
 around that connected 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:16.120
 ok now let's move on to the first functions 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.120
 headphone jack 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:24.280
 then we have connector just said 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:31.340
 usb to recharge it and transfer music 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:33.620
 via house and micro sd input from 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.800
 where then will obviously come to put the 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:46.390
 our music and where the c3 player will go 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:50.890
 to read the inserted music micro sd 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:58.820
 let's pass the ignition on 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:02:00.400
 ok actually here is it drives him to this 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.610
 made automatically 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:13.890

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:40.140
 in fact we have 1234 domains 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.630
