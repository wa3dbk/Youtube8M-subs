00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.529
 I would like to explain how to apply special afterimage effects by time remapping and echoing. 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:12.030
 think 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:15.890
 First of all, the material will be the material shot in a bowl in this way 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:21.320
 It takes a little slow motion 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:25.190
 Yes, I think that you want to apply it is the ne First timely map is for this consultation 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.370
 Yes I don't care about the map anywhere, but I just finished 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:32.500
 It looks like this 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:37.380
 I would like to see another movie about pen for yes , but it is time 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.380
 You can make it fast or slow 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:45.400
 Now it is against to this but this time I would like to use the effect to the outside of the echo 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:49.930
 Yes from effects just 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:51.430
 Many make the afterimage also ne This Is I is an echo of you in the place that this is it time 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.720
 a effective 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:01:01.120
 It is an effect Now I want to adapt this a bit 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:05.110
 Yes I'm an echo person Please see this person a little 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:08.619
 It is when the echo I usually see Panee car to take Well effect gold 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:13.390
 Time and the number start strength Ma Shuai 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:14.590
 Ryuei operator It is divided into such items , but it is what becomes point 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.990
 It's high time 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:20.649
 In other words , how many afterimage effects are left or it is an intractable disease, and now when it wins, time becomes a point 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.110
 to come 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:24.470
 Here 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:27.590
 Where timely maps take place and move quickly 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:34.340
 I mean it is Tokonan that shake just is it the camera is here 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:39.260
 If you move yourself fast == this camera is 0.2 because the camera plays well 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.440
 See that just because play afterimage effect in the place where became faster're listening effectively 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.500
 I will 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:49.110
 Yes Let's take a little try to see the time-remapping 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:53.130
 It seems like this echo is where you got faster with just 6 maps you want 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:58.130
 The echo time is just synchronized with this which is getting faster 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.130
 Now this kinda think that I want to look at the person of the preview 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.820
 The echo is on at an early point 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.179
 I think that I want you to master the way of expression by all means
