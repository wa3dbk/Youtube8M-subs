 and I June 3, 1997 preparatory tournament for the World Cup in France 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:13.380
 of 1998 the champion of the world and face the owners of the

 believed it would be a preview of the final of the event 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:22.269
 23 minutes into the game, an attack from Brazil was interrupted by a lack of 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:25.269
 far from the French goal 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.350
 roberto carlos one of the best fault collectors in the world was the 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:34.680
 southern manager 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.680
 that moment 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.320
 in testimony at the police station at the moment, on the other hand, it is known that 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.800
 collaborating with the confrontation against Gaddafi and al-Qaeda's spokesman 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.800
 the secretaries bare the goal 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.830
 meanwhile the people are very much on the shelf 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.580
 a young man of 20 years decided to return his trajectory 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.420
 the developer does not give much technology involved in trying to explain this 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.159
 phenomenal charge type 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.469
 explain the ball's trajectory and understand the strategies of the 

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:14.080
 players kicking 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.640
 the amazon commands classic examples with a free shot collection from roberto 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.170
 carlos against france 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.610
 the man he made dinner the ball like the left foot 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.790
 with the outside of the foot 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.360
 all this generated a great rotating movement and this movement generated a 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.579
 aerodynamic force that pushed the ball to the left 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.479
 unfolding by the media more than 30 meters per second and arriving 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.060
 quickly as the revolutions per minute the ball creating deferisse of 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.710
 prison 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.290
 on the right hand side of being so busy in a high area 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.000
 pressure that takes the ball to the opposite side of this ball behavior in a 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.810
 32-meter runway generates an operation up to four meters in the 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.420
 trajectory 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.510
 far enough to deceive or steal 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.629
 this means that he can initially kick the ball to the right of the barrier 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:14.609
 so that it crossed the barrier from the right but with that force

 aerodynamics that pushed the ball to the left yesterday 

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:21.299
 the ball made that incredible run and ended up getting into the goal 

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:25.699
 my father had no idea what was happening
