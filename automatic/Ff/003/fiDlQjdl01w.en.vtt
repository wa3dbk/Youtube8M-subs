and that is a hospital you can see where

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.179 
and that is a hospital you can see where
it's<00:00:22.570> going<00:00:22.689> to<00:00:22.810> bill<00:00:23.080> right<00:00:23.439> there<00:00:23.470> it's

going to be a very nice modern hospital

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.870 
going to be a very nice modern hospital
so<00:00:26.349> let's<00:00:26.829> get<00:00:27.009> straight<00:00:27.310> on<00:00:27.550> with<00:00:27.820> the

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 
so let's get straight on with the

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:34.229 
so let's get straight on with the
time-lapse<00:00:32.610> okay<00:00:33.610> so<00:00:33.670> we're<00:00:33.910> going<00:00:34.060> to<00:00:34.180> be

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
time-lapse okay so we're going to be

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.330 
time-lapse okay so we're going to be
starting<00:00:34.420> off<00:00:34.690> on<00:00:34.960> the<00:00:35.230> front<00:00:35.560> side<00:00:35.860> now<00:00:36.070> and

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
starting off on the front side now and

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.920 
starting off on the front side now and
we<00:00:36.460> were<00:00:36.580> using<00:00:36.790> cyan

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
we were using cyan

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.020 
we were using cyan
and<00:00:38.320> clay<00:00:38.740> for<00:00:38.950> the<00:00:39.040> bottom<00:00:39.340> half<00:00:39.370> and<00:00:39.820> then

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
and clay for the bottom half and then

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.460 
and clay for the bottom half and then
the<00:00:40.180> top<00:00:40.390> half<00:00:40.690> of<00:00:40.840> the<00:00:40.960> building<00:00:41.260> would<00:00:41.410> be

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470 
the top half of the building would be

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.100 
the top half of the building would be
using<00:00:41.890> snow<00:00:42.250> and<00:00:42.520> white<00:00:42.850> wool<00:00:43.210> now<00:00:43.750> you<00:00:43.840> can't

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
using snow and white wool now you can't

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.990 
using snow and white wool now you can't
really<00:00:44.320> see<00:00:44.680> the<00:00:45.010> difference<00:00:45.460> between<00:00:45.670> them

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
really see the difference between them

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.030 
really see the difference between them
two<00:00:46.180> blocks<00:00:46.450> in<00:00:46.600> this<00:00:46.720> texture<00:00:47.050> pack<00:00:47.080> but<00:00:47.890> if

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
two blocks in this texture pack but if

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.650 
two blocks in this texture pack but if
you<00:00:48.160> choose<00:00:48.460> default<00:00:48.670> it<00:00:49.120> would<00:00:49.330> look<00:00:49.390> pretty

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
you choose default it would look pretty

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.170 
you choose default it would look pretty
good<00:00:49.840> so<00:00:50.140> we<00:00:50.800> also<00:00:50.950> use<00:00:51.070> the<00:00:51.340> black<00:00:51.820> wolf

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
good so we also use the black wolf

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.390 
good so we also use the black wolf
behind<00:00:52.600> the<00:00:52.690> black<00:00:52.930> glass<00:00:53.200> because<00:00:53.680> this<00:00:54.100> part

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:54.400 
behind the black glass because this part

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.920 
behind the black glass because this part
the<00:00:54.580> building<00:00:54.910> wasn't<00:00:55.180> going<00:00:55.510> to<00:00:55.630> have<00:00:55.750> an

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
the building wasn't going to have an

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.470 
the building wasn't going to have an
interior<00:00:56.320> only<00:00:56.920> a<00:00:56.950> very<00:00:57.250> small<00:00:57.700> section<00:00:58.060> of

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
interior only a very small section of

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.420 
interior only a very small section of
the<00:00:59.110> entire<00:00:59.380> Hospital<00:00:59.620> would<00:01:00.160> have<00:01:00.310> the

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
the entire Hospital would have the

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.760 
the entire Hospital would have the
interior<00:01:00.850> and<00:01:01.390> that<00:01:01.540> would<00:01:01.630> be<00:01:01.780> done<00:01:02.320> later<00:01:02.560> on

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:02.770 
interior and that would be done later on

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.130 
interior and that would be done later on
in<00:01:02.920> the<00:01:03.040> video<00:01:03.150> but<00:01:04.150> this<00:01:04.269> fire<00:01:04.509> hut<00:01:04.720> was<00:01:04.930> a<00:01:04.960> bit

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
in the video but this fire hut was a bit

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.300 
in the video but this fire hut was a bit
different<00:01:05.320> token<00:01:05.680> else<00:01:05.830> because<00:01:06.070> I<00:01:06.100> had<00:01:06.250> an

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
different token else because I had an

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.520 
different token else because I had an
overhang<00:01:06.790> which<00:01:07.000> conceived<00:01:07.390> ER<00:01:07.539> and<00:01:07.749> whole

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
overhang which conceived ER and whole

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:09.690 
overhang which conceived ER and whole
building<00:01:08.829> itself<00:01:09.039> would<00:01:09.280> be<00:01:09.369> having<00:01:09.640> the

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
building itself would be having the

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.669 
building itself would be having the
overhang<00:01:10.060> in<00:01:10.240> daylight<00:01:10.780> sensors<00:01:11.289> which<00:01:11.530> I

00:01:11.669 --> 00:01:11.679 
overhang in daylight sensors which I

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:13.260 
overhang in daylight sensors which I
forgave<00:01:12.039> that<00:01:12.100> little<00:01:12.490> bit<00:01:12.579> more<00:01:12.609> depth<00:01:13.119> to

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
forgave that little bit more depth to

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.649 
forgave that little bit more depth to
the<00:01:13.390> building<00:01:13.810> and<00:01:14.999> ethiop<00:01:15.999> and<00:01:16.210> we<00:01:16.390> have<00:01:16.479> a

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 
the building and ethiop and we have a

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:18.419 
the building and ethiop and we have a
very<00:01:16.780> simple<00:01:17.289> stone<00:01:17.649> path<00:01:17.920> and<00:01:18.280> that's

00:01:18.419 --> 00:01:18.429 
very simple stone path and that's

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:21.300 
very simple stone path and that's
probably<00:01:18.640> for<00:01:18.909> that<00:01:18.999> section

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.429 

and<00:01:21.880> then<00:01:22.060> we<00:01:22.180> came<00:01:22.360> around<00:01:22.659> to<00:01:23.140> the<00:01:23.170> front

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
and then we came around to the front

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:25.950 
and then we came around to the front
where<00:01:23.799> we<00:01:23.920> were<00:01:24.070> continuing<00:01:24.670> the<00:01:25.149> gray<00:01:25.600> style

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
where we were continuing the gray style

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.230 
where we were continuing the gray style
long<00:01:26.200> front<00:01:26.560> but<00:01:27.130> signify<00:01:27.610> this<00:01:27.670> being<00:01:28.149> the

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
long front but signify this being the

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.940 
long front but signify this being the
main<00:01:28.450> entrance<00:01:28.990> we<00:01:29.229> were<00:01:29.320> actually<00:01:29.619> unused

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
main entrance we were actually unused

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.580 
main entrance we were actually unused
black<00:01:30.250> glass<00:01:30.579> and<00:01:30.820> said<00:01:31.030> now<00:01:31.539> isn't<00:01:31.869> really<00:01:32.140> a

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
black glass and said now isn't really a

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.560 
black glass and said now isn't really a
big<00:01:32.770> signal<00:01:33.610> of<00:01:33.850> it<00:01:34.090> being<00:01:34.240> the<00:01:34.360> front

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
big signal of it being the front

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.510 
big signal of it being the front
entrance<00:01:34.899> but<00:01:35.409> I<00:01:35.439> wanted<00:01:35.799> to<00:01:35.860> solve<00:01:36.130> make<00:01:36.340> it<00:01:36.490> a

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
entrance but I wanted to solve make it a

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.649 
entrance but I wanted to solve make it a
little<00:01:36.670> bit<00:01:36.759> different<00:01:37.090> to<00:01:37.240> rest<00:01:37.450> at<00:01:37.600> a

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
little bit different to rest at a

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.139 
little bit different to rest at a
hospital<00:01:38.020> so<00:01:38.770> I<00:01:38.799> decided<00:01:39.189> without<00:01:39.670> changing

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
hospital so I decided without changing

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:41.969 
hospital so I decided without changing
the<00:01:40.240> whole<00:01:40.450> thing<00:01:40.750> itself<00:01:41.049> I'd<00:01:41.380> quite<00:01:41.619> simply

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
the whole thing itself I'd quite simply

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:43.590 
the whole thing itself I'd quite simply
just<00:01:42.009> change<00:01:42.369> the<00:01:42.610> color<00:01:42.789> of<00:01:42.909> the<00:01:43.000> glass<00:01:43.179> and

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
just change the color of the glass and

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.319 
just change the color of the glass and
it<00:01:44.140> works<00:01:44.409> quite<00:01:44.619> nicely<00:01:45.060> although<00:01:46.060> the<00:01:46.119> one

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:46.329 
it works quite nicely although the one

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:47.850 
it works quite nicely although the one
thing<00:01:46.509> I<00:01:46.570> would<00:01:46.630> say<00:01:46.960> is<00:01:47.079> that<00:01:47.110> the<00:01:47.350> black<00:01:47.560> wall

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
thing I would say is that the black wall

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.469 
thing I would say is that the black wall
behind<00:01:48.039> its<00:01:48.369> all<00:01:48.520> makes<00:01:48.759> it<00:01:48.909> look<00:01:49.030> like<00:01:49.210> a<00:01:49.240> big

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
behind its all makes it look like a big

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.840 
behind its all makes it look like a big
black<00:01:49.810> block<00:01:50.289> so<00:01:51.039> it<00:01:51.280> wasn't<00:01:51.520> some<00:01:51.640> flowers

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
black block so it wasn't some flowers

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.699 
black block so it wasn't some flowers
too<00:01:52.030> keen<00:01:52.270> on<00:01:52.360> but<00:01:52.750> it<00:01:52.899> didn't<00:01:53.259> pick<00:01:53.350> up<00:01:53.470> quite

00:01:53.699 --> 00:01:53.709 
too keen on but it didn't pick up quite

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:56.190 
too keen on but it didn't pick up quite
nicely<00:01:54.149> now<00:01:55.149> the<00:01:55.330> main<00:01:55.569> part<00:01:55.810> here<00:01:55.959> was<00:01:56.080> going

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
nicely now the main part here was going

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.020 
nicely now the main part here was going
to<00:01:56.319> be<00:01:56.409> having<00:01:56.619> two<00:01:56.979> extra<00:01:57.340> stories<00:01:57.729> than<00:01:57.940> the

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
to be having two extra stories than the

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.859 
to be having two extra stories than the
one<00:01:58.149> on<00:01:58.179> the<00:01:58.360> left

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
one on the left

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:00.990 
one on the left
simply<00:01:59.289> give<00:01:59.500> that<00:01:59.619> a<00:01:59.649> little<00:01:59.890> bit<00:02:00.039> more<00:02:00.280> level

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
simply give that a little bit more level

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.100 
simply give that a little bit more level
to<00:02:01.030> the<00:02:01.299> whole<00:02:01.479> place<00:02:01.659> itself

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.570 

then<00:02:09.110> we<00:02:09.200> continued<00:02:09.619> this<00:02:09.800> wall<00:02:10.069> along<00:02:10.520> the

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
then we continued this wall along the

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.920 
then we continued this wall along the
side<00:02:10.850> where<00:02:11.090> we<00:02:11.209> were<00:02:11.300> going<00:02:11.450> to<00:02:11.569> making<00:02:11.840> a

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
side where we were going to making a

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.690 
side where we were going to making a
roof<00:02:12.230> now<00:02:12.650> later<00:02:12.980> on<00:02:13.100> in<00:02:13.160> the<00:02:13.340> video<00:02:13.459> you'll

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
roof now later on in the video you'll

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.309 
roof now later on in the video you'll
see<00:02:13.850> I<00:02:13.880> will<00:02:14.060> make<00:02:14.209> another<00:02:14.480> helipad<00:02:14.810> on<00:02:15.140> top

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
see I will make another helipad on top

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.850 
see I will make another helipad on top
of<00:02:15.470> here<00:02:16.660> but<00:02:17.660> for<00:02:17.840> now<00:02:17.959> we<00:02:18.230> just<00:02:18.410> continue

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
of here but for now we just continue

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.070 
of here but for now we just continue
with<00:02:19.190> daylight<00:02:19.640> sensors<00:02:20.120> and<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.660> whole<00:02:20.810> wall

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
with daylight sensors and the whole wall

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:36.980 
with daylight sensors and the whole wall
so<00:02:21.410> you<00:02:21.800> can<00:02:21.980> do<00:02:22.130> it<00:02:22.280> before

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.780 

now<00:02:37.560> we<00:02:37.620> came<00:02:37.860> around<00:02:37.950> to<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.250> section<00:02:38.610> where

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
now we came around to the section where

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.520 
now we came around to the section where
we're<00:02:39.030> going<00:02:39.210> to<00:02:39.330> be<00:02:39.420> doing<00:02:39.570> the<00:02:39.690> interior<00:02:40.050> so

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
we're going to be doing the interior so

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.930 
we're going to be doing the interior so
under<00:02:40.830> there<00:02:41.010> on<00:02:41.220> that<00:02:41.340> bottom<00:02:41.640> floor<00:02:41.820> is

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
under there on that bottom floor is

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.250 
under there on that bottom floor is
going<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.210> be<00:02:42.300> where<00:02:42.510> we'd<00:02:42.660> be<00:02:42.780> decorating

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
going to be where we'd be decorating

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.540 
going to be where we'd be decorating
inside<00:02:43.560> but<00:02:43.830> that<00:02:43.950> would<00:02:44.070> be<00:02:44.160> done<00:02:44.280> later

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
inside but that would be done later

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.820 
inside but that would be done later
olivio<00:02:45.000> flower<00:02:45.720> we<00:02:45.900> just<00:02:46.080> did<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.320> ball<00:02:46.560> and

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.810 

you'll<00:02:55.500> see<00:02:55.560> we<00:02:55.860> are<00:02:55.950> starting<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.400> continue

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
you'll see we are starting to continue

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.370 
you'll see we are starting to continue
our<00:02:57.000> normal<00:02:57.510> row<00:02:57.690> design<00:02:57.990> of<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.260> other

on the side and the cyan clay but

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.220 
on the side and the cyan clay but
because<00:03:02.820> it's<00:03:02.970> hospital<00:03:03.210> and<00:03:03.780> we<00:03:03.870> needed<00:03:04.140> to

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
because it's hospital and we needed to

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.210 
because it's hospital and we needed to
make<00:03:04.350> the<00:03:04.470> road<00:03:04.650> a<00:03:04.680> little<00:03:04.980> bit<00:03:05.070> more

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
important I have a yellow lines but that

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.200 
important I have a yellow lines but that
still<00:03:07.650> gave<00:03:07.830> us<00:03:07.980> a<00:03:08.070> 5<00:03:08.280> wide<00:03:08.610> road<00:03:08.940> in<00:03:09.120> the

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210 
still gave us a 5 wide road in the

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.030 
still gave us a 5 wide road in the
middle<00:03:09.330> allowing<00:03:10.020> us<00:03:10.230> to<00:03:10.260> add<00:03:10.470> vehicles<00:03:10.920> on

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
middle allowing us to add vehicles on

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:19.360 
middle allowing us to add vehicles on
there<00:03:11.220> which<00:03:11.340> we'll<00:03:11.520> do<00:03:11.700> in<00:03:11.910> a<00:03:12.000> minute<00:03:12.150> too

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.100 

first<00:03:20.370> we<00:03:20.610> have<00:03:20.880> to<00:03:21.030> do<00:03:21.150> a<00:03:21.360> little<00:03:21.660> central

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
first we have to do a little central

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.440 
first we have to do a little central
area<00:03:22.470> now<00:03:22.710> this<00:03:22.890> be<00:03:23.220> done<00:03:23.580> with<00:03:23.760> trees<00:03:24.150> with

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
area now this be done with trees with

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.449 
area now this be done with trees with
cobblestone<00:03:24.930> around<00:03:25.200> site<00:03:25.500> and<00:03:25.800> it<00:03:26.280> looked

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
cobblestone around site and it looked

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.280 
cobblestone around site and it looked
really<00:03:26.550> nice<00:03:26.910> it<00:03:27.240> really<00:03:27.450> brought<00:03:27.930> up<00:03:28.140> the

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
I'm pretty pleased with and then we just

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.300 
I'm pretty pleased with and then we just
continued<00:03:39.090> our<00:03:39.209> wall<00:03:39.420> around<00:03:39.930> the<00:03:40.080> front<00:03:40.350> like

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
continued our wall around the front like

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:49.850 
continued our wall around the front like
so

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.040
