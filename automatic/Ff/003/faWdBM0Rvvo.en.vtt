everybody Harris here and I want to show
you<00:00:03.840> guys<00:00:03.990> how<00:00:04.200> to<00:00:04.560> do<00:00:04.859> a<00:00:04.890> little<00:00:05.330> water

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
you guys how to do a little water

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.060 
you guys how to do a little water
blessing<00:00:06.839> and<00:00:07.080> I<00:00:07.529> know<00:00:08.010> it's<00:00:08.309> going<00:00:08.460> to<00:00:08.519> happen

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:10.070 
blessing and I know it's going to happen

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.160 
blessing and I know it's going to happen
potentially<00:00:11.070> is<00:00:11.309> that<00:00:11.910> people<00:00:12.420> are<00:00:12.630> going<00:00:12.840> to

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
potentially is that people are going to

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.499 
potentially is that people are going to
be<00:00:13.920> wondering<00:00:14.429> we'll<00:00:14.880> have<00:00:15.030> you<00:00:15.059> tested<00:00:15.420> it

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
be wondering we'll have you tested it

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.640 
be wondering we'll have you tested it
scientifically<00:00:15.990> if<00:00:16.139> you<00:00:16.199> have<00:00:16.379> you<00:00:16.470> actually

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
scientifically if you have you actually

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.080 
scientifically if you have you actually
done<00:00:16.830> water<00:00:17.190> filtration<00:00:17.400> test<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.029> the

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
done water filtration test and the

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.640 
done water filtration test and the
answer<00:00:18.270> is<00:00:18.300> no<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.750> I<00:00:18.840> would<00:00:19.020> love<00:00:19.230> it<00:00:19.470> if

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
answer is no and I would love it if

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.439 
answer is no and I would love it if
those<00:00:20.189> of<00:00:20.369> you<00:00:20.460> who<00:00:20.580> have<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:21.029> access<00:00:21.420> to

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
those of you who have the access to

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:22.670 
those of you who have the access to
materials<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:22.020> do<00:00:22.140> that<00:00:22.289> because<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:22.500> just

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
materials to do that because I just

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.140 
materials to do that because I just
found<00:00:22.769> out<00:00:22.920> about<00:00:23.010> this<00:00:23.250> like<00:00:23.400> last<00:00:23.640> week<00:00:23.850> and

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
found out about this like last week and

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.759 
found out about this like last week and
I've<00:00:24.600> been<00:00:24.750> doing<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.170> have<00:00:25.350> notice<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.710> the

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
I've been doing it I have notice of the

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.490 
I've been doing it I have notice of the
water<00:00:25.949> tastes<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.640> lot<00:00:26.849> different<00:00:27.269> but<00:00:28.080> I

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
water tastes a lot different but I

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.020 
water tastes a lot different but I
haven't<00:00:29.039> actually<00:00:29.400> done<00:00:30.240> any<00:00:30.420> type<00:00:30.689> of

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:32.030 
haven't actually done any type of

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.330 
haven't actually done any type of
scientific<00:00:33.030> test<00:00:33.270> so<00:00:33.660> if<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.410> guys<00:00:34.590> want<00:00:35.160> to

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
scientific test so if you guys want to

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.430 
scientific test so if you guys want to
do<00:00:35.489> this<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:35.790> would<00:00:35.940> HIGHLY<00:00:36.239> encourage<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.840> to

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
do this I would HIGHLY encourage you to

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.380 
do this I would HIGHLY encourage you to
test<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:37.980> if<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.280> have<00:00:38.430> access<00:00:38.940> like<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.210> said

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
test it if you have access like I said

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.750 
test it if you have access like I said
something<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:39.870> can<00:00:40.020> do<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.590> so<00:00:41.129> the

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
something that can do that and so the

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.639 
something that can do that and so the
way<00:00:41.910> this<00:00:42.090> works<00:00:42.149> is<00:00:42.660> through<00:00:42.930> intention<00:00:43.320> and

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
way this works is through intention and

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.069 
way this works is through intention and
through<00:00:44.129> energy<00:00:44.399> work<00:00:44.910> so<00:00:45.239> also<00:00:45.600> remember

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
through energy work so also remember

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.200 
through energy work so also remember
those<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.379> you<00:00:46.469> who<00:00:46.590> might<00:00:47.010> want<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.850> test<00:00:48.059> it

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
those of you who might want to test it

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.819 
those of you who might want to test it
is<00:00:48.360> that<00:00:48.840> if<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.020> come<00:00:49.289> from<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.559> place<00:00:49.770> of

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
is that if you come from a place of

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.380 
is that if you come from a place of
automatically<00:00:50.520> believing<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.090> won't<00:00:51.270> work

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
automatically believing it won't work

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.910 
automatically believing it won't work
than<00:00:51.660> your<00:00:51.780> test<00:00:52.020> will<00:00:52.289> show<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.710> doesn't

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
than your test will show that it doesn't

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.590 
than your test will show that it doesn't
work<00:00:53.010> on<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.850> other<00:00:53.969> hand<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.300> don't<00:00:54.480> want

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
work on the other hand I don't want

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.000 
work on the other hand I don't want
people<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.930> go<00:00:55.050> in<00:00:55.140> with<00:00:55.230> blind<00:00:55.530> faith<00:00:55.770> either

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
people to go in with blind faith either

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.799 
people to go in with blind faith either
and<00:00:56.280> say<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:56.670> absolutely<00:00:56.850> does<00:00:57.480> work

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
and say that it absolutely does work

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.869 
and say that it absolutely does work
because<00:00:58.590> that's<00:00:58.949> not<00:00:59.160> balanced<00:00:59.489> either<00:00:59.640> so

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
because that's not balanced either so

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.610 
because that's not balanced either so
for<00:01:00.600> those<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:00.960> who<00:01:01.050> might<00:01:01.170> want<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.410> test

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
for those of you who might want to test

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.619 
for those of you who might want to test
this<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:02.010> would<00:01:02.609> recommend<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:03.120> you<00:01:03.270> go<00:01:03.420> into

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
this I would recommend that you go into

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.090 
this I would recommend that you go into
it<00:01:03.719> with<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.840> spirit<00:01:04.229> of<00:01:04.290> well<00:01:04.619> let's<00:01:04.799> just

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
it with the spirit of well let's just

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.609 
it with the spirit of well let's just
see<00:01:05.309> okay<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.869> this<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.229> works<00:01:07.409> it's

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
see okay so this is that works it's

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.320 
see okay so this is that works it's
easier<00:01:07.979> if<00:01:08.070> your<00:01:08.220> energy<00:01:08.549> worker<00:01:08.729> but<00:01:09.030> even<00:01:09.240> if

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
easier if your energy worker but even if

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.609 
easier if your energy worker but even if
you're<00:01:09.450> not<00:01:09.479> technically<00:01:09.960> an<00:01:10.110> energy<00:01:10.409> worker

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
you're not technically an energy worker

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.429 
you're not technically an energy worker
people<00:01:11.610> can<00:01:11.729> all<00:01:11.850> feel<00:01:11.970> energy<00:01:12.420> if<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:13.260> have<00:01:13.409> a

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
people can all feel energy if you have a

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.570 
people can all feel energy if you have a
loved<00:01:13.680> one<00:01:13.770> in<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.010> room<00:01:14.130> and<00:01:14.310> they're<00:01:14.430> in<00:01:14.520> a

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
loved one in the room and they're in a

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.830 
loved one in the room and they're in a
bad<00:01:14.729> mood<00:01:15.000> they<00:01:15.150> don't<00:01:15.299> necessarily<00:01:15.420> need<00:01:15.780> to

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
bad mood they don't necessarily need to

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.810 
bad mood they don't necessarily need to
say<00:01:16.020> anything<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.680> know<00:01:16.799> it's<00:01:17.100> just<00:01:17.610> part

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
say anything and you know it's just part

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.550 
say anything and you know it's just part
of<00:01:17.909> being<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.210> human<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.720> be<00:01:18.840> able<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.170> feel

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
of being a human to be able to feel

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.880 
of being a human to be able to feel
energy<00:01:20.159> flows<00:01:20.430> so<00:01:21.360> this<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:21.900> how<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.439> works<00:01:22.590> and

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
energy flows so this is how it works and

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.039 
energy flows so this is how it works and
i'm<00:01:23.159> going<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.369> use<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:24.030> little<00:01:24.570> elixir<00:01:24.930> that

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
i'm going to use a little elixir that

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.570 
i'm going to use a little elixir that
i've<00:01:25.170> been<00:01:25.320> drinking<00:01:25.470> lately<00:01:25.740> which<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.280> a

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
i've been drinking lately which is a

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.140 
i've been drinking lately which is a
little<00:01:27.619> son<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.650> citrine<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.579> little<00:01:29.820> stone

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
little son of citrine and a little stone

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.380 
little son of citrine and a little stone
of<00:01:30.479> rose<00:01:31.049> quartz<00:01:31.409> put<00:01:32.250> these<00:01:32.430> together<00:01:32.640> in<00:01:33.090> the

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
when I'm drinking a cup or two of this

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.249 
when I'm drinking a cup or two of this
every<00:01:48.420> day<00:01:48.450> my<00:01:49.079> skin<00:01:49.350> is<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.619> lot<00:01:50.180> smoother

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
every day my skin is a lot smoother

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.710 
every day my skin is a lot smoother
which<00:01:52.259> is<00:01:52.530> always<00:01:52.740> nice<00:01:53.009> right<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:53.939> for<00:01:54.659> those

of<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.930> who<00:01:55.049> know<00:01:55.170> how<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.320> do<00:01:55.470> this<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.890> just

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
of you who know how to do this you just

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.490 
of you who know how to do this you just
charge<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.549> up<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.880> really<00:01:57.840> all<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.290> is

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
charge it up and really all it is is

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.780 
charge it up and really all it is is
holding<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:58.979> between<00:01:59.100> your<00:01:59.369> hands<00:01:59.520> are<00:01:59.640> even

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
holding it between your hands are even

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.450 
holding it between your hands are even
just<00:01:59.969> sending<00:02:00.270> your<00:02:00.420> thought<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.770> and

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
just sending your thought to it and

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.149 
just sending your thought to it and
ask<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.760> to<00:02:03.500> emphasize<00:02:04.500> all<00:02:04.830> of<00:02:04.979> the

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
ask it to emphasize all of the

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.029 
ask it to emphasize all of the
beneficial<00:02:05.760> qualities<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.330> this<00:02:06.890> whether<00:02:07.890> or

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
beneficial qualities of this whether or

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.499 
beneficial qualities of this whether or
not<00:02:08.130> you<00:02:08.310> know<00:02:08.459> what<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:08.700> is<00:02:08.819> but<00:02:08.850> when<00:02:09.270> you<00:02:09.360> say

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
not you know what it is but when you say

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.090 
not you know what it is but when you say
something<00:02:09.569> like<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:09.959> it<00:02:10.200> kind<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.440> just<00:02:10.679> is<00:02:10.890> a

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
something like that it kind of just is a

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.740 
something like that it kind of just is a
great<00:02:11.340> catch<00:02:11.520> off<00:02:11.640> okay<00:02:12.270> so<00:02:12.330> now<00:02:12.540> for<00:02:12.569> the

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
great catch off okay so now for the

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.630 
great catch off okay so now for the
actual<00:02:12.990> water<00:02:13.200> blessing<00:02:13.650> so<00:02:14.160> far<00:02:14.400> as<00:02:14.490> I've

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
actual water blessing so far as I've

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.220 
actual water blessing so far as I've
been<00:02:14.670> able<00:02:14.880> to<00:02:15.150> understand<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:15.900> way<00:02:16.050> that

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
been able to understand the way that

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.740 
been able to understand the way that
this<00:02:16.350> works<00:02:16.590> is<00:02:19.880> then<00:02:20.880> you<00:02:21.030> connect<00:02:21.480> with<00:02:21.600> the

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
this works is then you connect with the

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.020 
this works is then you connect with the
full<00:02:22.380> water<00:02:22.680> grid<00:02:23.069> with<00:02:23.280> your<00:02:23.459> consciousness

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
full water grid with your consciousness

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.630 
full water grid with your consciousness
with<00:02:24.360> your<00:02:24.660> energy<00:02:25.200> so<00:02:25.530> for<00:02:26.069> instance<00:02:26.160> I<00:02:26.400> run<00:02:26.610> a

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
with your energy so for instance I run a

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.949 
with your energy so for instance I run a
lot<00:02:26.790> of<00:02:26.819> energy<00:02:27.090> through<00:02:27.270> my<00:02:27.420> hands<00:02:27.720> so<00:02:27.810> this

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
lot of energy through my hands so this

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.410 
lot of energy through my hands so this
is<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.590> way<00:02:28.709> that<00:02:28.860> I<00:02:28.920> do<00:02:29.069> it<00:02:29.430> now<00:02:29.610> those<00:02:30.180> of<00:02:30.360> you

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
is the way that I do it now those of you

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.360 
is the way that I do it now those of you
who<00:02:30.450> run<00:02:30.840> it<00:02:30.959> other<00:02:31.110> ways<00:02:31.319> maybe<00:02:32.040> you<00:02:32.220> can

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
who run it other ways maybe you can

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.290 
who run it other ways maybe you can
think<00:02:32.400> of<00:02:32.610> something<00:02:32.760> else<00:02:32.940> that<00:02:33.150> more

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
think of something else that more

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.810 
think of something else that more
adequately<00:02:34.190> represents<00:02:35.190> what<00:02:35.489> you<00:02:35.700> naturally

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
adequately represents what you naturally

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.030 
adequately represents what you naturally
do<00:02:36.300> but<00:02:36.780> for<00:02:37.290> those<00:02:37.380> people<00:02:37.590> out<00:02:37.800> there<00:02:37.920> who

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
do but for those people out there who

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.320 
do but for those people out there who
attracted<00:02:38.459> to<00:02:38.550> water<00:02:38.670> who<00:02:38.880> attracted<00:02:39.239> the

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
attracted to water who attracted the

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.060 
attracted to water who attracted the
springs<00:02:39.660> especially<00:02:40.230> I<00:02:40.380> think<00:02:40.739> we<00:02:40.830> have<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.010> lot

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
springs especially I think we have a lot

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.430 
springs especially I think we have a lot
of<00:02:41.220> spring<00:02:41.700> elementals<00:02:42.510> incarnate<00:02:43.350> in<00:02:43.410> the

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
of spring elementals incarnate in the

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.930 
of spring elementals incarnate in the
human<00:02:43.739> race<00:02:43.860> who<00:02:44.010> are<00:02:44.100> asleep<00:02:44.340> right<00:02:44.550> now<00:02:44.610> and

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
human race who are asleep right now and

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.790 
human race who are asleep right now and
I<00:02:45.390> think<00:02:45.420> that<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:45.780> more<00:02:45.930> spring<00:02:46.320> elementals

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
I think that the more spring elementals

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.229 
I think that the more spring elementals
who<00:02:46.920> realize<00:02:47.250> that<00:02:47.430> your<00:02:47.550> spring<00:02:47.880> and<00:02:48.060> i<00:02:48.090> don't

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
who realize that your spring and i don't

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.610 
who realize that your spring and i don't
mean<00:02:48.269> the<00:02:48.360> season<00:02:48.780> i<00:02:48.900> mean<00:02:49.080> water<00:02:49.260> pouring

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
mean the season i mean water pouring

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.410 
mean the season i mean water pouring
forces<00:02:50.010> on<00:02:50.070> the<00:02:50.130> ground<00:02:50.390> realize<00:02:51.390> your

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
forces on the ground realize your

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.120 
forces on the ground realize your
elementals<00:02:52.080> and<00:02:52.320> started<00:02:52.680> practice<00:02:52.980> with<00:02:53.100> it

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
elementals and started practice with it

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.740 
elementals and started practice with it
i<00:02:53.280> think<00:02:53.640> that<00:02:53.880> things<00:02:54.239> might<00:02:54.390> shift<00:02:54.600> in<00:02:54.720> a

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
i think that things might shift in a

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.660 
i think that things might shift in a
beneficial<00:02:54.930> way<00:02:55.260> for<00:02:55.560> our<00:02:55.670> ecosystem

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
beneficial way for our ecosystem

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.460 
beneficial way for our ecosystem
wherever<00:02:57.209> you<00:02:57.840> happen<00:02:57.989> to<00:02:58.140> be<00:02:58.230> whatever

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
wherever you happen to be whatever

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.280 
wherever you happen to be whatever
ecosystem<00:02:59.100> you<00:02:59.160> happen<00:02:59.400> to<00:02:59.459> be<00:02:59.550> in<00:02:59.580> so<00:03:00.300> what

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
ecosystem you happen to be in so what

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.110 
ecosystem you happen to be in so what
you<00:03:01.410> do<00:03:01.530> is<00:03:01.560> you<00:03:02.250> run<00:03:02.519> the<00:03:02.670> water<00:03:02.819> and<00:03:03.000> it's

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
you do is you run the water and it's

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.220 
you do is you run the water and it's
better<00:03:03.239> if<00:03:03.390> it's<00:03:03.450> cold<00:03:03.690> this<00:03:03.959> is<00:03:04.050> kind<00:03:04.200> of

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
better if it's cold this is kind of

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.300 
better if it's cold this is kind of
freezing<00:03:04.560> my<00:03:04.650> hand<00:03:04.800> out<00:03:04.920> a<00:03:04.950> little<00:03:05.100> bit<00:03:05.220> i'm

gonna make it just a little bit of armor
although<00:03:07.680> it's<00:03:08.100> probably<00:03:08.190> better<00:03:08.519> to<00:03:08.610> keep<00:03:08.790> it

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
although it's probably better to keep it

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.880 
although it's probably better to keep it
cold<00:03:09.540> them<00:03:09.780> just<00:03:09.959> not<00:03:10.079> that<00:03:10.230> hardcore<00:03:10.530> that<00:03:10.829> i

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
cold them just not that hardcore that i

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.680 
cold them just not that hardcore that i
can<00:03:11.040> hand<00:03:11.250> it<00:03:11.370> handle<00:03:11.760> it<00:03:11.850> this<00:03:11.910> ice<00:03:12.120> cold<00:03:12.360> I'm

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.000 
can hand it handle it this ice cold I'm
in<00:03:12.810> Northern<00:03:13.079> California<00:03:13.170> right<00:03:13.590> now<00:03:13.620> so<00:03:13.860> it's

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
in Northern California right now so it's

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.729 
in Northern California right now so it's
pretty<00:03:14.190> cool<00:03:14.360> coming<00:03:15.360> from<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.510> faucet<00:03:15.720> ok<00:03:16.290> so

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
pretty cool coming from the faucet ok so

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.050 
pretty cool coming from the faucet ok so
you<00:03:16.799> link<00:03:17.160> it<00:03:17.250> in<00:03:17.370> with<00:03:17.549> right<00:03:17.760> where<00:03:17.940> your

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
you link it in with right where your

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.940 
you link it in with right where your
palm<00:03:18.239> chakra<00:03:18.690> originates<00:03:19.260> which<00:03:19.470> is<00:03:19.650> right

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
palm chakra originates which is right

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.580 
palm chakra originates which is right
here<00:03:20.400> right<00:03:21.360> there<00:03:21.570> in<00:03:21.660> the<00:03:21.690> little<00:03:21.959> divot<00:03:22.260> ok

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
here right there in the little divot ok

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.100 
here right there in the little divot ok
so<00:03:23.280> you<00:03:23.700> let<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.180> waterfall<00:03:24.690> on<00:03:24.840> your<00:03:24.959> palm

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
so you let the waterfall on your palm

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.870 
so you let the waterfall on your palm
chakra<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:25.590> then<00:03:25.769> you<00:03:25.920> feel<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.489> energy<00:03:26.700> of

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
chakra and then you feel the energy of

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.490 
chakra and then you feel the energy of
the<00:03:26.940> water<00:03:27.120> and<00:03:27.329> what<00:03:27.570> water<00:03:27.810> feels<00:03:28.260> like

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
the water and what water feels like

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.699 
the water and what water feels like
energetically<00:03:29.540> it's<00:03:30.540> just<00:03:30.810> pure<00:03:31.140> conductor

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
energetically it's just pure conductor

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.240 
energetically it's just pure conductor
so<00:03:32.280> it'll<00:03:32.940> just<00:03:32.970> feel<00:03:33.390> like<00:03:33.630> open<00:03:34.440> open<00:03:35.010> space

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
so it'll just feel like open open space

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.720 
so it'll just feel like open open space
and<00:03:35.720> so<00:03:36.720> you<00:03:37.470> allow<00:03:37.769> your<00:03:38.070> consciousness<00:03:38.579> to

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
and so you allow your consciousness to

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.310 
and so you allow your consciousness to
go<00:03:38.820> up<00:03:39.030> into<00:03:39.269> the<00:03:39.390> pipe<00:03:39.630> and<00:03:39.870> through<00:03:40.140> this

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
go up into the pipe and through this

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.650 
go up into the pipe and through this
stream<00:03:40.650> of<00:03:40.920> water<00:03:41.160> and<00:03:41.519> allow<00:03:42.239> yourself<00:03:42.570> to

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
stream of water and allow yourself to

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.210 
stream of water and allow yourself to
bless<00:03:42.870> it<00:03:42.900> just<00:03:43.230> fill<00:03:43.410> it<00:03:43.530> in<00:03:43.650> my<00:03:43.799> case<00:03:44.040> I<00:03:44.160> just

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
doing this I haven't minded drinking tap

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:04.640 
doing this I haven't minded drinking tap
water<00:04:03.269> granted<00:04:03.930> I've<00:04:03.989> only<00:04:04.079> been<00:04:04.320> in<00:04:04.380> places

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
water granted I've only been in places

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.090 
water granted I've only been in places
where<00:04:04.859> the<00:04:04.950> tap<00:04:05.100> water<00:04:05.130> is<00:04:05.579> relatively

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
where the tap water is relatively

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.980 
where the tap water is relatively
I<00:04:06.130> mean<00:04:06.280> I<00:04:06.490> don't<00:04:06.970> know<00:04:07.030> if<00:04:07.150> I<00:04:07.240> go<00:04:07.420> to<00:04:07.480> like<00:04:07.690> Los

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:07.990 
I mean I don't know if I go to like Los

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.540 
I mean I don't know if I go to like Los
Angeles<00:04:08.530> and<00:04:08.710> drink<00:04:08.860> the<00:04:08.920> tap<00:04:09.040> water<00:04:09.100> because

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:09.550 
Angeles and drink the tap water because

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.610 
Angeles and drink the tap water because
the<00:04:09.580> tap<00:04:10.000> water<00:04:10.030> in<00:04:10.270> Los<00:04:10.390> Angeles<00:04:10.420> is<00:04:10.990> always

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
the tap water in Los Angeles is always

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.710 
the tap water in Los Angeles is always
recycled<00:04:12.100> so<00:04:12.280> it's<00:04:12.460> full<00:04:12.880> of<00:04:13.030> stuff<00:04:13.450> that<00:04:13.600> I

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
recycled so it's full of stuff that I

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.000 
recycled so it's full of stuff that I
might<00:04:13.900> not<00:04:14.020> want<00:04:14.290> to<00:04:14.380> be<00:04:14.440> drinking<00:04:14.740> but<00:04:14.890> it

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
might not want to be drinking but it

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.590 
might not want to be drinking but it
would<00:04:15.100> be<00:04:15.130> worth<00:04:15.340> a<00:04:15.430> try<00:04:15.580> I<00:04:15.790> don't<00:04:15.970> know<00:04:16.030> so

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
would be worth a try I don't know so

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.390 
would be worth a try I don't know so
anyway<00:04:16.840> you<00:04:17.290> let<00:04:17.440> it<00:04:17.560> fall<00:04:17.709> on<00:04:17.739> your<00:04:18.010> chakra

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
anyway you let it fall on your chakra

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.949 
anyway you let it fall on your chakra
blasting<00:04:18.970> the<00:04:19.030> water<00:04:19.209> up<00:04:19.390> and<00:04:19.540> down<00:04:19.690> and<00:04:19.900> then

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
blasting the water up and down and then

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.510 
blasting the water up and down and then
you<00:04:20.140> make<00:04:20.260> a<00:04:20.290> trough<00:04:20.680> out<00:04:20.920> of<00:04:21.040> your<00:04:21.160> fingers

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:21.520 
you make a trough out of your fingers

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.700 
you make a trough out of your fingers
see<00:04:22.240> how<00:04:22.420> that<00:04:22.480> makes<00:04:22.750> kind<00:04:23.080> of<00:04:23.170> a<00:04:23.260> trough<00:04:23.530> and

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
see how that makes kind of a trough and

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.290 
see how that makes kind of a trough and
it's<00:04:23.860> falling<00:04:24.160> out<00:04:24.280> of<00:04:24.310> edge<00:04:24.460> and<00:04:24.820> then<00:04:25.210> you

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
it's falling out of edge and then you

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.840 
it's falling out of edge and then you
fill<00:04:25.510> your<00:04:25.630> cup<00:04:25.950> from<00:04:26.950> the<00:04:27.010> trough<00:04:27.310> milissia

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
fill your cup from the trough milissia

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.790 
fill your cup from the trough milissia
is<00:04:28.030> one<00:04:28.180> of<00:04:28.300> the<00:04:28.420> beings<00:04:29.350> in<00:04:29.440> my<00:04:29.470> life<00:04:29.680> that

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
is one of the beings in my life that

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.410 
is one of the beings in my life that
showed<00:04:29.950> me<00:04:30.100> how<00:04:30.190> to<00:04:30.220> do<00:04:30.400> this<00:04:30.520> because<00:04:30.700> she

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
showed me how to do this because she

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.600 
showed me how to do this because she
likes<00:04:31.600> to<00:04:31.720> drink<00:04:31.960> water<00:04:32.200> from<00:04:32.320> my<00:04:32.590> hands<00:04:33.040> and<00:04:33.160> I

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
likes to drink water from my hands and I

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.880 
likes to drink water from my hands and I
never<00:04:33.850> understood<00:04:33.910> why<00:04:34.540> until<00:04:35.170> I<00:04:35.290> realized

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:35.890 
never understood why until I realized

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.740 
never understood why until I realized
that<00:04:36.340> this<00:04:36.460> could<00:04:36.670> happen<00:04:36.700> and<00:04:37.150> then<00:04:37.270> I<00:04:37.360> got<00:04:37.540> it

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
that this could happen and then I got it

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.210 
that this could happen and then I got it
she'd<00:04:38.200> rather<00:04:38.260> drink<00:04:38.560> from<00:04:38.740> my<00:04:38.800> hands<00:04:38.980> on<00:04:39.130> you

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
she'd rather drink from my hands on you

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.950 
she'd rather drink from my hands on you
where<00:04:39.340> else<00:04:39.460> okay<00:04:39.760> and<00:04:40.030> then<00:04:40.630> you've<00:04:40.780> got<00:04:40.810> your

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
where else okay and then you've got your

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.380 
where else okay and then you've got your
full<00:04:41.320> jar<00:04:41.860> or<00:04:42.130> I'm<00:04:42.850> actually<00:04:43.030> gonna<00:04:43.240> put<00:04:43.360> a

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
full jar or I'm actually gonna put a

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.330 
full jar or I'm actually gonna put a
little<00:04:43.480> bit<00:04:43.660> more<00:04:43.780> and<00:04:43.930> then<00:04:44.040> what<00:04:45.040> I<00:04:45.070> do<00:04:45.160> with

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
little bit more and then what I do with

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.070 
little bit more and then what I do with
this<00:04:45.430> particular<00:04:45.640> elixir<00:04:46.390> is<00:04:46.540> I<00:04:46.660> like<00:04:46.810> to<00:04:46.840> put

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
this particular elixir is I like to put

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.810 
this particular elixir is I like to put
in<00:04:47.170> a<00:04:47.290> sprig<00:04:47.680> of<00:04:47.710> fresh<00:04:47.920> right<00:04:48.490> now<00:04:48.640> it's

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
in a sprig of fresh right now it's

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.520 
in a sprig of fresh right now it's
oregano<00:04:49.060> because<00:04:49.540> that's<00:04:49.690> what<00:04:49.750> I<00:04:49.900> currently

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
oregano because that's what I currently

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.560 
oregano because that's what I currently
have<00:04:50.830> as<00:04:51.070> a<00:04:51.100> fresh<00:04:51.340> plan<00:04:51.610> I'm<00:04:51.790> probably<00:04:52.360> going

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
have as a fresh plan I'm probably going

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:53.790 
have as a fresh plan I'm probably going
to<00:04:52.660> get<00:04:52.720> a<00:04:52.780> basil<00:04:53.110> plant<00:04:53.200> and<00:04:53.440> do<00:04:53.500> it<00:04:53.590> with<00:04:53.680> that

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
to get a basil plant and do it with that

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.410 
to get a basil plant and do it with that
sometimes<00:04:54.220> too<00:04:54.310> so<00:04:54.580> I<00:04:54.610> just<00:04:54.820> pinched<00:04:55.090> this<00:04:55.240> off

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:55.420 
sometimes too so I just pinched this off

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.440 
sometimes too so I just pinched this off
of<00:04:55.600> the<00:04:55.690> oregano<00:04:55.900> plant<00:04:56.290> about<00:04:57.330> 15<00:04:58.330> minutes

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
of the oregano plant about 15 minutes

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.240 
of the oregano plant about 15 minutes
ago<00:04:58.630> maybe<00:04:58.900> maybe<00:04:59.440> a<00:04:59.560> little<00:04:59.650> bit<00:04:59.800> longer<00:04:59.920> and

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
ago maybe maybe a little bit longer and

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.190 
ago maybe maybe a little bit longer and
i<00:05:00.730> asked<00:05:00.910> the<00:05:01.180> oregano<00:05:01.390> plant<00:05:01.750> what<00:05:01.930> to<00:05:02.020> take

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
i asked the oregano plant what to take

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.050 
i asked the oregano plant what to take
and<00:05:02.260> then<00:05:02.470> it<00:05:02.620> was<00:05:02.740> like<00:05:02.980> my<00:05:03.430> eyes<00:05:03.580> were<00:05:03.820> drawn

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
and then it was like my eyes were drawn

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.580 
and then it was like my eyes were drawn
to<00:05:04.210> this<00:05:04.270> particular<00:05:04.450> sprig<00:05:05.140> at<00:05:05.380> that

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
to this particular sprig at that

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:06.870 
to this particular sprig at that
particular<00:05:05.770> breaking<00:05:06.460> point<00:05:06.730> where<00:05:06.850> I

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
particular breaking point where I

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.900 
particular breaking point where I
pinched<00:05:07.120> it<00:05:07.210> off<00:05:07.360> and<00:05:08.160> then<00:05:09.160> that<00:05:09.340> just<00:05:09.520> goes

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
pinched it off and then that just goes

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.360 
pinched it off and then that just goes
in<00:05:10.030> the<00:05:10.090> water<00:05:10.120> and<00:05:10.560> what<00:05:11.560> I<00:05:11.590> find<00:05:11.950> is<00:05:12.340> that

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
in the water and what I find is that

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.310 
in the water and what I find is that
teeth<00:05:12.850> kind<00:05:13.240> of<00:05:13.330> steeps<00:05:13.570> itself<00:05:13.960> if<00:05:14.140> I<00:05:14.260> just

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
teeth kind of steeps itself if I just

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.260 
teeth kind of steeps itself if I just
sit<00:05:14.560> this<00:05:14.710> on<00:05:14.890> the<00:05:14.980> counter<00:05:15.250> for<00:05:15.280> half<00:05:16.120> hour

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:16.270 
sit this on the counter for half hour

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.200 
sit this on the counter for half hour
hour<00:05:16.570> or<00:05:16.870> longer<00:05:17.050> it'll<00:05:17.860> go<00:05:18.250> ahead<00:05:18.400> and<00:05:18.550> do<00:05:19.060> it

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
hour or longer it'll go ahead and do it

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.790 
hour or longer it'll go ahead and do it
and<00:05:19.240> it'll<00:05:19.450> be<00:05:19.600> delicious<00:05:19.840> and<00:05:19.990> fine<00:05:20.290> or<00:05:20.590> you

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
and it'll be delicious and fine or you

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.020 
and it'll be delicious and fine or you
can<00:05:20.890> sit<00:05:21.070> it<00:05:21.160> in<00:05:21.220> the<00:05:21.310> window<00:05:21.490> so<00:05:21.730> the<00:05:21.850> Sun

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
can sit it in the window so the Sun

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.370 
can sit it in the window so the Sun
comes<00:05:22.300> through<00:05:22.510> and<00:05:22.630> steeps<00:05:22.870> it<00:05:23.020> even<00:05:23.230> more

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
comes through and steeps it even more

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.130 
comes through and steeps it even more
but<00:05:24.130> generally<00:05:24.790> I<00:05:24.820> use<00:05:25.390> a<00:05:25.420> tea<00:05:25.750> bag<00:05:25.900> for

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:26.140 
but generally I use a tea bag for

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.800 
but generally I use a tea bag for
probably<00:05:26.380> two<00:05:26.590> jars<00:05:26.860> because<00:05:27.490> it<00:05:27.910> will<00:05:28.390> keep

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
probably two jars because it will keep

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.500 
probably two jars because it will keep
its<00:05:28.990> charge<00:05:29.080> for<00:05:29.530> that<00:05:29.560> long<00:05:29.800> its<00:05:30.510> chemical

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510 
its charge for that long its chemical

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.510 
its charge for that long its chemical
charge<00:05:31.930> it'll<00:05:32.170> keep<00:05:32.320> making<00:05:32.620> the<00:05:32.710> tea<00:05:32.860> before

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
charge it'll keep making the tea before

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.580 
charge it'll keep making the tea before
it's<00:05:33.670> too<00:05:33.880> weak<00:05:34.060> and<00:05:34.210> yes<00:05:34.810> well<00:05:35.080> let<00:05:35.200> this<00:05:35.350> sit

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
it's too weak and yes well let this sit

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.320 
it's too weak and yes well let this sit
for<00:05:35.620> about<00:05:35.920> like<00:05:36.430> I<00:05:36.790> said<00:05:36.940> about<00:05:37.090> a<00:05:37.150> half

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
for about like I said about a half
