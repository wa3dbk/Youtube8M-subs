00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.180 
Diego and that's what we're trying to
build<00:01:44.510> into<00:01:44.810> the<00:01:44.840> mentality<00:01:45.470> into<00:01:45.710> the<00:01:45.920> pliers

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
build into the mentality into the pliers

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.280 
build into the mentality into the pliers
that<00:01:46.970> they're<00:01:47.120> representing<00:01:47.720> an<00:01:47.810> area<00:01:48.140> and

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
that they're representing an area and

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.470 
that they're representing an area and
that's<00:01:49.190> what<00:01:49.310> we've<00:01:49.460> done<00:01:49.610> in<00:01:49.790> Europe<00:01:50.330> in

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 
that's what we've done in Europe in

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.210 
that's what we've done in Europe in
recent<00:01:50.810> times<00:01:51.020> and<00:01:51.260> hopefully<00:01:51.920> that's<00:01:52.100> what

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
recent times and hopefully that's what

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.530 
recent times and hopefully that's what
we<00:01:52.310> can<00:01:52.460> do<00:01:52.550> with<00:01:52.640> these<00:01:52.730> players<00:01:53.000> they<00:01:53.090> want

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
we can do with these players they want

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:54.940 
we can do with these players they want
them<00:01:53.660> to<00:01:53.780> be<00:01:53.900> friends<00:01:54.320> on<00:01:54.410> and<00:01:54.680> off<00:01:54.770> the<00:01:54.920> field

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
them to be friends on and off the field

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.310 
them to be friends on and off the field
and<00:01:55.340> hopefully<00:01:56.150> that<00:01:56.300> will<00:01:56.450> put<00:01:56.960> us<00:01:56.990> in<00:01:57.170> good

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
and hopefully that will put us in good

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.490 
and hopefully that will put us in good
stead<00:01:57.410> and<00:01:57.620> good<00:01:57.800> foundations
