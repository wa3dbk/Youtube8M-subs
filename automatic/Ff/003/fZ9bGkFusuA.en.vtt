more<00:02:46.660> than<00:02:46.810> that<00:02:47.050> the<00:02:47.410> reason<00:02:47.770> being<00:02:47.800> is

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
more than that the reason being is

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.960 
more than that the reason being is
because<00:02:48.250> um<00:02:49.800> you're<00:02:50.800> on<00:02:51.540> iphones<00:02:52.540> and<00:02:53.970> ipod

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
because um you're on iphones and ipod

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.990 
because um you're on iphones and ipod
touches<00:02:55.510> on<00:02:55.720> they<00:02:56.350> need<00:02:56.560> a<00:02:57.070> drone<00:02:57.280> certain

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
touches on they need a drone certain

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.170 
touches on they need a drone certain
task<00:02:59.370> so<00:03:00.370> for<00:03:00.670> example<00:03:01.650> this<00:03:02.650> task<00:03:03.010> will<00:03:03.970> like

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
task so for example this task will like

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.450 
task so for example this task will like
take<00:03:05.190> ram<00:03:06.190> and<00:03:07.800> they<00:03:08.800> also<00:03:09.040> need<00:03:09.310> to<00:03:09.370> be

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
take ram and they also need to be

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.740 
take ram and they also need to be
running<00:03:10.240> at<00:03:10.510> all<00:03:10.570> times<00:03:11.010> so<00:03:12.010> you<00:03:12.040> cannot<00:03:12.460> like

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
running at all times so you cannot like

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.160 
running at all times so you cannot like
you<00:03:13.750> cannot<00:03:14.080> like<00:03:14.770> stopped<00:03:15.220> or<00:03:15.430> delete<00:03:15.940> them

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
you cannot like stopped or delete them

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.090 
you cannot like stopped or delete them
which<00:03:17.170> is<00:03:17.320> why<00:03:17.500> the<00:03:18.070> limit<00:03:18.400> is<00:03:18.520> 300<00:03:18.880> because

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
which is why the limit is 300 because

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.830 
which is why the limit is 300 because
these<00:03:21.100> tasks<00:03:22.320> they<00:03:23.320> take<00:03:23.560> up<00:03:23.770> to<00:03:24.720> here<00:03:25.720> they

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
these tasks they take up to here they

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.800 
these tasks they take up to here they
are<00:03:25.990> they<00:03:26.620> take<00:03:26.860> up<00:03:26.890> to<00:03:27.930> 196<00:03:28.930> mega<00:03:29.500> um

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
are they take up to 196 mega um

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.530 
are they take up to 196 mega um
megabytes<00:03:31.810> yeah<00:03:32.140> of<00:03:32.380> ram<00:03:33.150> so<00:03:34.150> these<00:03:34.300> are<00:03:34.510> the

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
megabytes yeah of ram so these are the

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.210 
megabytes yeah of ram so these are the
tests<00:03:34.870> if<00:03:35.110> you<00:03:35.170> want<00:03:35.440> to<00:03:35.500> take<00:03:35.620> a<00:03:35.650> look<00:03:35.770> at<00:03:36.010> them

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
tests if you want to take a look at them

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.390 
tests if you want to take a look at them
view<00:03:36.520> you<00:03:37.030> are<00:03:37.330> not<00:03:37.600> you<00:03:38.110> cannot<00:03:38.440> like<00:03:38.680> stopped

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
view you are not you cannot like stopped

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.030 
view you are not you cannot like stopped
in<00:03:39.640> so<00:03:40.540> if<00:03:40.870> you<00:03:41.020> tap<00:03:41.260> on<00:03:41.290> them<00:03:41.590> I<00:03:41.680> won't<00:03:41.890> do

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
in so if you tap on them I won't do

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.620 
in so if you tap on them I won't do
anything<00:03:43.500> so<00:03:44.500> let's<00:03:44.710> go<00:03:44.830> back<00:03:45.270> so<00:03:46.270> yeah<00:03:46.420> that's

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
anything so let's go back so yeah that's

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:52.500 
anything so let's go back so yeah that's
that<00:03:46.830> the<00:03:47.830> ID<00:03:48.340> iphone<00:03:48.730> 4<00:03:48.970> has<00:03:49.540> only<00:03:49.750> um<00:03:51.510> 504

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
that the ID iphone 4 has only um 504

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.110 
that the ID iphone 4 has only um 504
megabytes<00:03:53.320> of<00:03:53.560> RAM<00:03:54.000> so<00:03:55.000> your<00:03:55.750> limit<00:03:56.110> is<00:03:56.260> 300

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
megabytes of RAM so your limit is 300

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:04.820 
megabytes of RAM so your limit is 300
does<00:03:58.120> this<00:03:58.980> um<00:04:01.350> how<00:04:02.350> much<00:04:02.530> run<00:04:02.830> you<00:04:03.640> can<00:04:03.880> get

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
does this um how much run you can get

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.620 
does this um how much run you can get
there's<00:04:05.830> a<00:04:05.950> limit<00:04:06.310> there<00:04:07.090> we<00:04:07.180> go<00:04:07.270> that's<00:04:07.540> the

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
there's a limit there we go that's the

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.470 
there's a limit there we go that's the
limit<00:04:08.050> of<00:04:08.140> the<00:04:08.650> amount<00:04:09.640> of<00:04:09.700> ram<00:04:09.940> you<00:04:10.150> can<00:04:10.180> get

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
limit of the amount of ram you can get

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.470 
limit of the amount of ram you can get
so<00:04:10.660> let's<00:04:10.840> click<00:04:11.050> on<00:04:11.170> optimize<00:04:15.210> sorry<00:04:16.210> if<00:04:16.359> I'm

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
so let's click on optimize sorry if I'm

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.770 
so let's click on optimize sorry if I'm
talking<00:04:16.510> way<00:04:16.930> too<00:04:16.960> much

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:28.520 

so<00:04:21.780> here<00:04:21.930> we<00:04:22.050> go<00:04:23.810> spring<00:04:24.810> up<00:04:25.050> to<00:04:25.230> ram<00:04:27.320> this<00:04:28.320> will

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
so here we go spring up to ram this will

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.010 
so here we go spring up to ram this will
only<00:04:28.650> take<00:04:28.830> a<00:04:28.950> couple<00:04:29.190> of<00:04:29.430> seconds<00:04:30.000> not<00:04:30.660> even<00:04:30.840> a

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
only take a couple of seconds not even a

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.240 
only take a couple of seconds not even a
minute<00:04:31.350> I<00:04:31.680> don't<00:04:32.370> think<00:04:32.610> it<00:04:32.730> takes<00:04:32.940> more<00:04:33.090> than

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
minute I don't think it takes more than

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.290 
minute I don't think it takes more than
30<00:04:35.250> seconds<00:04:35.790> max<00:04:36.470> of<00:04:37.490> course<00:04:38.490> this<00:04:38.940> might<00:04:39.120> look

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
30 seconds max of course this might look

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.450 
30 seconds max of course this might look
laggy<00:04:39.660> to<00:04:39.930> you<00:04:40.140> because<00:04:40.560> i'm<00:04:40.740> recording<00:04:41.280> the

but<00:05:29.580> you<00:05:30.060> know<00:05:30.090> you<00:05:31.050> need<00:05:31.260> those<00:05:31.440> task<00:05:32.540> because

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:33.540 
but you know you need those task because

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.890 
but you know you need those task because
there's<00:05:34.260> like<00:05:34.650> they<00:05:35.580> do<00:05:35.640> they're<00:05:36.630> there<00:05:36.870> for

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
there's like they do they're there for

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.620 
there's like they do they're there for
something<00:05:37.530> for<00:05:38.190> example<00:05:38.580> if<00:05:38.670> you're<00:05:38.820> like<00:05:39.090> app

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
something for example if you're like app

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.280 
something for example if you're like app
is<00:05:39.960> taking<00:05:40.290> too<00:05:40.410> long<00:05:40.590> to<00:05:40.650> like<00:05:41.010> load<00:05:41.310> um

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:42.290 
is taking too long to like load um

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:45.770 
is taking too long to like load um
there's<00:05:43.290> a<00:05:43.380> task<00:05:43.770> that<00:05:44.220> will<00:05:44.640> like<00:05:44.880> crash<00:05:45.600> the

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
there's a task that will like crash the

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.670 
there's a task that will like crash the
app<00:05:45.960> that<00:05:46.770> way<00:05:46.950> you<00:05:47.720> you<00:05:48.720> don't<00:05:49.260> have<00:05:49.320> to<00:05:49.530> like

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
app that way you you don't have to like

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:55.700 
app that way you you don't have to like
stay<00:05:50.010> there<00:05:50.310> waiting<00:05:50.730> for<00:05:51.110> too<00:05:52.110> long<00:05:52.290> um<00:05:54.710> and
