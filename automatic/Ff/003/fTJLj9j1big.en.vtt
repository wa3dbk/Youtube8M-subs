00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
they supplied us and those trees

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:06.220 
they supplied us and those trees

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:12.550 
here and there's pre-drilled holes
already<00:04:09.590> on<00:04:10.099> the<00:04:10.220> top<00:04:10.400> on<00:04:10.519> the<00:04:10.640> bottom<00:04:11.530> let<00:04:12.530> me

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
already on the top on the bottom let me

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.229 
already on the top on the bottom let me
show<00:04:12.769> you<00:04:13.450> there<00:04:14.450> on<00:04:14.599> the<00:04:14.720> bottom<00:04:15.049> there<00:04:15.230> and

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
show you there on the bottom there and

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.050 
show you there on the bottom there and
what<00:04:17.239> you<00:04:17.329> want<00:04:17.449> to<00:04:17.509> do<00:04:17.660> is<00:04:18.639> take<00:04:19.639> your<00:04:19.789> screw

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
what you want to do is take your screw

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.860 
what you want to do is take your screw
and<00:04:20.389> obviously<00:04:21.350> screw<00:04:21.650> it<00:04:21.739> into<00:04:21.889> the<00:04:22.100> hole<00:04:22.280> and

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
and obviously screw it into the hole and

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.659 
and obviously screw it into the hole and
what<00:04:23.870> this<00:04:23.990> does<00:04:24.259> is<00:04:24.530> that<00:04:24.740> it'll<00:04:25.039> anchor<00:04:25.460> down

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
what this does is that it'll anchor down

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.840 
what this does is that it'll anchor down
and<00:04:26.830> give<00:04:27.830> it<00:04:27.860> a<00:04:27.979> little<00:04:28.100> bit<00:04:28.280> more<00:04:28.460> strength

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
and give it a little bit more strength

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.080 
and give it a little bit more strength
just<00:04:29.630> so<00:04:29.780> it<00:04:29.930> stays<00:04:30.650> together<00:04:30.830> if<00:04:31.759> you<00:04:31.910> just

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
just so it stays together if you just

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.969 
just so it stays together if you just
have<00:04:32.240> the<00:04:32.360> dowels<00:04:32.570> and<00:04:32.810> would<00:04:33.110> it<00:04:33.229> necessarily

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:33.979 
have the dowels and would it necessarily

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:35.230 
have the dowels and would it necessarily
stay<00:04:34.610> together

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
stay together

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:41.529 
stay together
so<00:04:36.130> as<00:04:37.130> you<00:04:37.699> screw<00:04:37.970> those<00:04:38.120> in<00:04:40.300> there's<00:04:41.300> just

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:41.539 
so as you screw those in there's just

00:04:41.539 --> 00:05:07.090 
so as you screw those in there's just
four<00:04:41.780> screws

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.980 

all<00:05:07.580> right<00:05:07.700> so<00:05:07.880> it<00:05:08.000> should<00:05:08.150> fit<00:05:08.330> snug<00:05:08.600> and<00:05:08.870> as

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
all right so it should fit snug and as

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.470 
all right so it should fit snug and as
you<00:05:09.140> can<00:05:09.320> grab<00:05:09.500> the<00:05:09.620> bottom<00:05:10.010> and<00:05:10.670> if<00:05:11.240> it

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:11.480 
you can grab the bottom and if it

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.060 
you can grab the bottom and if it
Wiggles<00:05:11.870> a<00:05:11.930> little<00:05:12.200> bit<00:05:12.320> you<00:05:12.590> might<00:05:12.770> want<00:05:13.010> to

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.070 
Wiggles a little bit you might want to

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:14.380 
Wiggles a little bit you might want to
tighten<00:05:13.460> down<00:05:13.490> your<00:05:13.790> screws<00:05:14.000> a<00:05:14.030> little<00:05:14.270> bit

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.390 
tighten down your screws a little bit

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.960 
tighten down your screws a little bit
more<00:05:14.570> just<00:05:15.260> so<00:05:15.380> you<00:05:15.440> have<00:05:15.680> it<00:05:16.220> nice<00:05:16.610> and<00:05:16.640> tight

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
more just so you have it nice and tight

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.350 
more just so you have it nice and tight
so<00:05:17.000> it<00:05:17.240> doesn't<00:05:17.480> you<00:05:17.780> know<00:05:18.020> fall<00:05:18.050> apart<00:05:18.560> and

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
so it doesn't you know fall apart and

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.420 
so it doesn't you know fall apart and
then<00:05:20.360> what<00:05:20.630> you<00:05:20.750> want<00:05:20.900> to<00:05:20.930> do<00:05:21.080> is<00:05:21.350> take<00:05:21.710> it<00:05:21.920> flip

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
then what you want to do is take it flip

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.560 
then what you want to do is take it flip
it<00:05:22.550> right<00:05:22.790> side<00:05:22.850> up<00:05:23.530> and<00:05:25.120> what<00:05:26.120> we're<00:05:26.270> going<00:05:26.540> to

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
it right side up and what we're going to

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:30.150 
it right side up and what we're going to
do<00:05:26.810> now<00:05:27.580> is<00:05:28.580> we're<00:05:28.820> going<00:05:29.000> to<00:05:29.120> attach<00:05:29.390> the<00:05:29.720> top

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
do now is we're going to attach the top

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:39.850 
do now is we're going to attach the top
so<00:05:31.160> the<00:05:31.970> top<00:05:32.270> is<00:05:36.250> you<00:05:37.250> know<00:05:37.370> letter<00:05:37.670> e<00:05:37.880> and<00:05:38.860> it

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
so the top is you know letter e and it

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:43.440 
so the top is you know letter e and it
obviously<00:05:40.370> goes<00:05:41.020> they<00:05:42.020> have<00:05:42.320> pre-drilled

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:43.450 
obviously goes they have pre-drilled

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:47.290 
obviously goes they have pre-drilled
holes<00:05:44.450> for<00:05:44.960> where<00:05:45.110> the<00:05:45.200> hinges<00:05:45.470> go<00:05:45.680> and<00:05:46.300> the

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 
holes for where the hinges go and the

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.580 
holes for where the hinges go and the
hinges<00:05:47.600> are<00:05:47.720> right<00:05:47.840> here<00:05:48.170> right<00:05:50.380> here<00:05:51.380> and

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590 
hinges are right here right here and

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.460 
hinges are right here right here and
these<00:05:52.520> holes<00:05:52.820> go<00:05:53.360> directly<00:05:53.780> where<00:05:54.050> the<00:05:54.140> hinges

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
these holes go directly where the hinges

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.680 
these holes go directly where the hinges
go<00:05:54.590> so<00:05:55.280> what<00:05:55.400> we're<00:05:55.520> gonna<00:05:55.580> do<00:05:55.850> and<00:05:56.240> I<00:05:56.480> found

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.690 
go so what we're gonna do and I found

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.950 
go so what we're gonna do and I found
the<00:05:56.840> best<00:05:56.990> way<00:05:57.200> to<00:05:57.230> do<00:05:57.500> this<00:05:57.710> is<00:05:58.400> to<00:05:58.760> actually

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 
the best way to do this is to actually

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.260 
the best way to do this is to actually
lay<00:05:59.960> down<00:06:00.170> inside<00:06:00.710> and<00:06:01.340> this<00:06:01.460> kind<00:06:01.760> of<00:06:01.820> awkward

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270 
lay down inside and this kind of awkward

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.050 
lay down inside and this kind of awkward
to<00:06:02.860> you<00:06:03.860> know<00:06:03.980> do<00:06:04.160> this<00:06:04.310> all<00:06:04.490> at<00:06:04.580> once<00:06:04.790> just

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.060

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
with one person so if you lay it on its

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.540 
with one person so if you lay it on its
side<00:06:07.550> and<00:06:07.910> you<00:06:08.390> line<00:06:08.630> it<00:06:08.750> up<00:06:08.840> with<00:06:08.960> the<00:06:09.110> holes

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550
