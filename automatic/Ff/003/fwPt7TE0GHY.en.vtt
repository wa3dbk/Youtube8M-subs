five<00:04:18.930> districts<00:04:19.320> at<00:04:19.470> I<00:04:19.620> think<00:04:19.770> it<00:04:19.950> was<00:04:20.070> under

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
five districts at I think it was under

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.700 
five districts at I think it was under
$10<00:04:21.680> obviously<00:04:22.680> there<00:04:22.800> was<00:04:22.919> a<00:04:22.950> kind<00:04:23.490> of

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
$10 obviously there was a kind of

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.249 
$10 obviously there was a kind of
time<00:04:23.949> special<00:04:24.630> and<00:04:25.630> I<00:04:25.720> don't<00:04:25.810> think<00:04:25.930> and<00:04:26.139> get

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:26.259 
time special and I don't think and get

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:27.749 
time special and I don't think and get
it<00:04:26.350> for<00:04:26.470> that<00:04:26.590> currently<00:04:26.979> but<00:04:27.160> I<00:04:27.190> think<00:04:27.370> if<00:04:27.669> you

00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:27.759 
it for that currently but I think if you

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:29.180
