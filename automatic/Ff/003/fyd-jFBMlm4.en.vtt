00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.170
 hello to all so today you 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.460
 explain how to make a piece of furniture 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.910
 fishing rods or excuse me I have a 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.750
 little buggy 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.779
 then it will first take four 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.589
 boards as on the picture there so the 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:25.050
 boards are one meter by 10 cm next 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:29.759
 it will take two boards as 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:33.360
 on the picture also from 1 to 25 out of 25 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:35.400
 cm so for the first step you 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.250
 take two boards of 1 meter on ten 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:42.390
 and with a hole saw wanted to find 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.040
 all along so to make half 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.160
 circles but that they are well one 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.880
 in front of the others okay so next 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:56.280
 you will take your first 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:01:00.630
 board with holes and you go the screw and in 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.850
 bones in the corner of a big board 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.500
 it's a bit explained it's a bit 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.909
 complicated to explain but to look at 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.960
 the schematics you should understand not 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.790
 the photos and you should understand 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.030
 so with the finders you well 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.460
 heard then you do the same thing 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.429
 down but with the holes out 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.920
 Finally the outward winters 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:21.780
 you can say that like that 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.049
 then you take a board of 1 m 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.049
 on 10 but not holed and you make a 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.460
 angle a few centimeters below 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.569
 the board you come from is 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:37.139
 there I put 45 degrees so that for 

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:38.280
 to hold whites that next your 

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:42.689
 last board 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.880
 it will suffice from the m in the fund for 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.920
 hold the intent structure it's not 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.869
 badly unstable so there you can see the 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.299
 result 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.639
 it does not hurt and then it helps 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.209
 of stored goods other materials 

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:56.159
 without damaging it 

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:57.959
 so I hope you enjoyed it 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.639
 a short video I do not know exactly 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:02.670
 if you will understand because 

00:01:59.639 --> 00:02:04.409
 it was hard explained if you have trouble 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.909
 to understand tell me I will try 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.659
 must make a video a little more 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.600
 explicit 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.370
 or will you explain in comment 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.690
 there is no problem so I hope that 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.990
 you'll like it and see you soon 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.349
 world 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.349
 goodbye
