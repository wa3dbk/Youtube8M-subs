dollar has lost more but all other
dollars<00:00:58.530> are<00:00:58.680> still<00:00:58.890> losing<00:00:59.160> that<00:01:00.120> comes<00:01:00.420> with

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
dollars are still losing that comes with

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.650 
dollars are still losing that comes with
the<00:01:00.690> inflationary<00:01:01.590> aspect<00:01:02.430> their<00:01:02.940> prices<00:01:03.420> go

the inflationary aspect their prices go

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.830 
the inflationary aspect their prices go
higher<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:05.240> that<00:01:06.240> means<00:01:06.450> you're<00:01:06.600> buying

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
higher and that means you're buying

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.440 
higher and that means you're buying
power<00:01:07.200> has<00:01:07.650> less<00:01:08.000> so<00:01:09.000> when<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.240> talk<00:01:09.420> about

getting out of the dollar I mean buying

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.870 
getting out of the dollar I mean buying
real<00:01:12.450> tangible<00:01:12.930> assets<00:01:13.830> within<00:01:14.070> strings<00:01:14.640> 'ok
