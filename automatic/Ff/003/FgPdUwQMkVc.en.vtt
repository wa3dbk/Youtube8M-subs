00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello now we will show how to remove 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:10.260
 door trim 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:13.500
 bmw x5 53 will be the first thing we shoot here 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:19.410
 this one is a picnic that we have here 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:29.789
 here it turns out 2 so what we 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:33.230
 remove remove the label airbag all the latch 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:46.670
 came out and the expert should be removed 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:51.059
 tree bolts 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:58.430
 then remove here kermi where 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:01:03.229
 and the glass drops on remove the terminals 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:07.830
 disconnecting it completely very simply 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:13.580
 moves forward for chewing so she 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:19.790
 pulls out so then remove the stick handle 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:23.130
 he moves back to take the latch off 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:28.490
 then unscrew 4 bolts one 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:33.720
 is here 2 under the stub 3 goes 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:37.770
 near the handle and 4 just below 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.920
 near the glove compartment the very end or 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.610
 you can remove the bulb before 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.740
 is right under the door then 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:51.409
 we scoop special spatulas 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.409
 trim and tear down the door 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:02.679
 here is white due to the latch 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:08.380
 fits all special spatula 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:08.380
 I think the latch is on top 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:28.660
 all of our protection is obtained by the seed of the cable 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:33.620
 cesium 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:35.750
 so there is still a wire to after this 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.900
 connection plating here and connect them 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.629
 the light bulb that goes to our pen and 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.760
 here it is necessary to climb farther 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:44.480
 will turn off the pillow pillow we already 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.010
 twisted 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:53.569
 here it looks like it is bolted to 1 2 3 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:58.099
 bolt and such from the terminal block here as well 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:03:01.720
 the same sequence we collect all 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.720
