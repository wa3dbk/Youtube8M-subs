00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.379
 I people these armchairs at 3:10 to 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.180
 that you're fine again for a 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:17.970
 new video on the channel the first 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:21.750
 hour review of the year because since yesterday 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.100
 21h and set up people on 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.690
 fifa ultimate team so we did not hurt 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.520
 of players who have grown and we are going 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.550
 start with the alexander lacazette 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:32.129
 version 2d of a form that goes from 80 to 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.450
 84 2 general has had enough enough you 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:34.710
 have these statines guys who are trying 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.300
 to scroll I invite you to put 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.920
 on pause to put back is 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.870
 observed at the team level 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.640
 a team really very very 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.620
 competitive an hour team that 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.180
 strongly resembles the team that 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.780
 I had done for the diego review 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.350
 costa and lacazette inform version at 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.290
 very early 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.670
 2 fifa ultimate team so lacazette 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.440
 cifq version is what can be said of 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.680
 him I'm going to start by talking about 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.880
 its price a price that surprised me actually 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.230
 his price surprised me because I 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.270
 was really expecting that its price 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.530
 explode as the palace goes 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.780
 take out the meal update the 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.460
 go out but not at all on the contrary the 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.840
 prices have totally broken the mouth 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.189
 and suddenly the last time I 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.229
 watched you price lacazette towards 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.299
 second form he was below the 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.969
 500 credit miles so if you have them 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.679
 credits to buy do not hesitate 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:21.539
 really not because it's all 

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:22.859
 simply monstrous so we go 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:24.299
 now talk about the negatives and 

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:25.880
 positive points we will start with 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.990
 the negatives as usual 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.029
 so at the level of the negative points his 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.299
 head game he 's 79 years old precision of the 

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:32.189
 head 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.420
 it's really interesting that certainly 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.009
 will really make the head but I have 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.179
 found that there was a little there was 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.840
 waste still had waste 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:38.849
 in the head game 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.499
 I scored a goal of the head 

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:42.270
 besides a very beautiful goal a beautiful 

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:43.409
 diving head but it's true that in 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.999
 I found that there was 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.639
 waste on that side so I stood firm 

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:49.619
 to specify it and the three stars 

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:51.179
 bad foot it's really a shame 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.529
 to have a left foot rather means 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:55.409
 even though that and I made a few passes 

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:56.849
 decisive with what I did as soon as 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.170
 I also noticed with his left foot 

00:01:56.849 --> 00:02:00.790
 I thought it was a shame to be 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.460
 limited to not have the four stars 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.080
 bad foot then the pros positive the 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.450
 lacazette version 2d of a form because 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.050
 after that there really is that so already 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.420
 the finish 93 in finish that's all 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.250
 simply monstrous in front of the cages 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.900
 it's a guardian killer you hit in 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.180
 force you do foot dishes everything 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.510
 that you want it is almost a goal 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.730
 every time and it's really cool 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.620
 by the way that's a question I 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.910
 think he's going to ask me is what I 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.400
 found a difference compared to 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.019
 the old version 2d of a form I 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.580
 played a few matches with version 2d 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:36.280
 without that I had already found very very 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.540
 good voice is 80.2 general but you 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.489
 still feel the difference 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.680
 especially at the speed of the 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.060
 mostly hits and the ball checks 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.620
 and I actually found that there he 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.870
 was very very impressive by 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.700
 compared to the old version 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.950
 then all that is assigned 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.750
 physical etc I'll see you at the end 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.750
 in the balance sheet engineering in more physical 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.780
 I put everything because his stats are 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.060
 quite simply 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.730
 of madness which already 90 speed 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.250
 on the map he goes very very fast 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.860
 then one to 88 in agility 1.88 in 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.450
 balance and 1.81 in strength 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.970
 it's simple it falls almost 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.950
 never except when it is cut and 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.319
 it is a pool big fat positive point 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.940
 it is to have a day case rather a 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:19.370
 small size it's true it closes and 75 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.800
 so it's not the player either 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.540
 bigger of the game but if they have 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.100
 actually very good on his legs so 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.319
 that's a big positive for the level 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.000
 its positioning 94 years positioning 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:29.800
 always well placed very easy to 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.330
 find 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.400
 even if I admit the only fault of the 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.130
 Lacazette actually is the way to 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.269
 play with a view that goes fast 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.739
 in the ball checks c the 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.209
 killing that made me think 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.440
 a little messi or if its equity 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.290
 ball and it's like with benzema 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.000
 on second inform you tend to 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.470
 a little too much force on the 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.300
 especially what will be all right and 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.600
 cetera with not take the head when you 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:56.660
 cheeks with and that's still pretty 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:58.250
 shame the 84 year old vision with a 76 year old 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.750
 not if he is able to very close to 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.700
 to make very beautiful openings 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.530
 although it's true that I did not do 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.049
 too many assists actually during 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.610
 this review because precisely of a 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:09.380
 costa water was not too much in shape next 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.519
 at home he did not necessarily want to 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.769
 so mark there it's already the last 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:14.329
 clip at the level of don quixote 91 chf 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:15.709
 87 in striking power like you 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:18.109
 could see on this distant shot 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.489
 the ball is really very good 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.019
 and I have tried others a demon 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.390
 cat every time it went well crc 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.880
 not come back but still so there you 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.560
 have the balance sheet of lacazette up second 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.910
 a form that is displayed in front of your 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.630
 eyes so at the pro level positive 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:34.970
 the vision finish 93 in finish 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.990
 guardian belt dribbling I have not 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.450
 spoken but technically very 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.950
 impressive 91 in-game dribble 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.740
 so all that is going to be running the 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.020
 dribbles c of the physical killing I 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.710
 embrace everything 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.720
 balance strength agility speed jump 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.639
 I did not talk about it but 81 in relaxation 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.840
 so bye firm and 75 years old and yet 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:53.110
 I said he was taking balloons from the 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.599
 head 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.460
 the 85-year ball checks control 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:58.870
 long hot positioning very very 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.460
 easy to find quality pass one 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.900
 very good pass quality so that can 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.190
 to be an attacker who will score 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.729
 goals and also who will make passes 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.680
 decisive 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:07.810
 although it's true that 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.789
 as much as the remark I have the 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.229
 quality of typing and that's the brilliance very 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:12.699
 beautiful technical gesture technically you 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:13.960
 are not limited in terms of age is therefore 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:15.789
 it's always very interesting 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.990
 the hitting power the balloons by 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:19.780
 very very strong and so in the points 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:21.820
 negative head game and the three stars 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.729
 bad foot see the record with 12 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.440
 matches 20 goals 3 assists and 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:28.120
 it's just monstrous 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.800
 felt in-game so that's it 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.650
 for this review by alexandre lacazette 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.419
 version up cif it's too long to say the 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.680
 title is too long I hope this 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:37.539
 review you call do not hesitate to me
