full of string and it kind of is a lot

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.810 
full of string and it kind of is a lot
of<00:02:03.229> string<00:02:03.500> but<00:02:03.680> you'll<00:02:03.830> be<00:02:03.860> weaving<00:02:04.369> it<00:02:04.520> so

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
of string but you'll be weaving it so

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.590 
of string but you'll be weaving it so
the<00:02:05.240> length<00:02:05.479> is<00:02:05.840> right<00:02:07.030> next<00:02:08.030> you<00:02:08.270> just<00:02:08.450> want

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
the length is right next you just want

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.260 
the length is right next you just want
to<00:02:08.690> cut<00:02:09.140> it<00:02:09.170> off<00:02:09.410> and<00:02:09.800> align<00:02:10.489> the<00:02:10.700> two<00:02:10.940> ends

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
to cut it off and align the two ends

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.380 
to cut it off and align the two ends
together<00:02:11.420> so<00:02:12.410> you<00:02:12.470> have<00:02:12.940> what<00:02:13.940> it<00:02:14.030> looks<00:02:14.209> like

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
together so you have what it looks like

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.460 
together so you have what it looks like
two<00:02:14.630> rows<00:02:14.840> of<00:02:15.110> string<00:02:16.900> next<00:02:17.900> you<00:02:17.989> want<00:02:18.170> to<00:02:18.260> take

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
two rows of string next you want to take

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.949 
two rows of string next you want to take
this<00:02:18.650> top<00:02:19.130> of<00:02:19.310> the<00:02:19.370> string<00:02:19.670> and<00:02:19.880> clip<00:02:20.540> it<00:02:20.690> on<00:02:20.810> to

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
this top of the string and clip it on to

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.630 
this top of the string and clip it on to
like<00:02:21.200> a<00:02:21.230> piece<00:02:21.470> of<00:02:21.620> paper<00:02:21.769> or<00:02:22.160> like<00:02:22.280> a<00:02:22.310> hard

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
like a piece of paper or like a hard

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.880 
like a piece of paper or like a hard
surface<00:02:23.120> and<00:02:23.480> then<00:02:24.319> you<00:02:24.410> just<00:02:24.620> want<00:02:24.800> to

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
surface and then you just want to

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.370 
surface and then you just want to
stretch<00:02:25.390> okay<00:02:26.390> here<00:02:26.600> comes<00:02:26.810> the<00:02:26.930> confusing

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
stretch okay here comes the confusing

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.340 
stretch okay here comes the confusing
part<00:02:28.360> basically<00:02:29.360> what<00:02:29.510> you're<00:02:29.660> gonna<00:02:29.750> do<00:02:30.080> is

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
part basically what you're gonna do is

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.070 
part basically what you're gonna do is
you're<00:02:31.040> gonna<00:02:31.130> take<00:02:31.250> one<00:02:32.180> side<00:02:32.480> of<00:02:32.600> the<00:02:32.690> string

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
you're gonna take one side of the string

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.309 
you're gonna take one side of the string
fold<00:02:33.890> it<00:02:34.040> over<00:02:34.190> the<00:02:35.150> other<00:02:35.360> side<00:02:35.690> and<00:02:36.049> then

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
fold it over the other side and then

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.199 
fold it over the other side and then
pull<00:02:36.590> it<00:02:36.709> through<00:02:36.739> so<00:02:37.250> it<00:02:37.670> kind<00:02:37.880> of<00:02:37.940> looks<00:02:38.120> like

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
pull it through so it kind of looks like

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:39.759 
pull it through so it kind of looks like
you're<00:02:38.420> tying<00:02:38.660> a<00:02:38.780> knot<00:02:39.019> but<00:02:39.260> you<00:02:39.380> want<00:02:39.530> to<00:02:39.620> make

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
you're tying a knot but you want to make

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.390 
you're tying a knot but you want to make
it<00:02:39.890> flat<00:02:40.360> so<00:02:41.360> here<00:02:42.350> it<00:02:42.440> is<00:02:42.530> in<00:02:42.680> like<00:02:42.830> a<00:02:42.860> slower

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
it flat so here it is in like a slower

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:50.920 
it flat so here it is in like a slower
motion<00:02:48.640> basically<00:02:49.640> what<00:02:50.150> you're<00:02:50.390> gonna<00:02:50.540> do<00:02:50.750> is

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
motion basically what you're gonna do is

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.240 
motion basically what you're gonna do is
take<00:02:50.959> the<00:02:51.230> right<00:02:51.880> put<00:02:52.880> it<00:02:52.910> over<00:02:53.859> the<00:02:54.859> left<00:02:55.130> side

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
take the right put it over the left side

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.560 
take the right put it over the left side
of<00:02:55.850> the<00:02:56.030> string<00:02:56.530> and<00:02:57.880> then<00:02:58.880> what<00:02:59.329> you're<00:02:59.450> gonna

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
of the string and then what you're gonna

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.770 
of the string and then what you're gonna
do<00:02:59.780> is<00:02:59.930> pull<00:03:00.230> from<00:03:00.470> underneath<00:03:00.859> and<00:03:01.600> make<00:03:02.600> sure

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
do is pull from underneath and make sure

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.780 
do is pull from underneath and make sure
that<00:03:02.959> it's<00:03:03.170> kind<00:03:03.590> of<00:03:03.680> lined<00:03:03.920> up<00:03:04.130> so<00:03:04.310> it<00:03:04.430> doesn't

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
that it's kind of lined up so it doesn't

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.150 
that it's kind of lined up so it doesn't
form<00:03:05.030> a<00:03:05.120> knot<00:03:05.420> and<00:03:05.690> it's<00:03:05.989> flat<00:03:06.470> it<00:03:06.739> makes<00:03:07.010> the

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
form a knot and it's flat it makes the

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.060 
form a knot and it's flat it makes the
little<00:03:07.340> choker<00:03:08.060> pattern<00:03:08.600> so<00:03:09.320> here<00:03:09.920> it<00:03:09.980> is

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
little choker pattern so here it is

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.840 
little choker pattern so here it is
again<00:03:10.310> you<00:03:10.549> take<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.540> left<00:03:11.780> fold<00:03:12.709> it<00:03:12.890> over<00:03:13.400> the

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
again you take the left fold it over the

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.259 
again you take the left fold it over the
right<00:03:14.090> and<00:03:14.420> pull<00:03:15.260> it<00:03:15.410> through<00:03:15.769> so<00:03:16.040> it<00:03:17.000> makes

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
right and pull it through so it makes

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.660 
right and pull it through so it makes
the<00:03:17.510> flat<00:03:17.810> choker<00:03:18.320> pattern<00:03:18.709> and<00:03:18.980> you're<00:03:19.519> gonna

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
the flat choker pattern and you're gonna

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.509 
the flat choker pattern and you're gonna
alternate<00:03:20.359> sides<00:03:20.750> every<00:03:21.170> single<00:03:21.470> time<00:03:21.709> and<00:03:22.010> if

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
alternate sides every single time and if

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.370 
alternate sides every single time and if
you<00:03:22.609> get<00:03:22.790> confused<00:03:22.940> an<00:03:23.570> easy<00:03:23.810> way<00:03:24.019> to<00:03:24.049> remember

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
you get confused an easy way to remember

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.870 
you get confused an easy way to remember
is<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:25.790> flat<00:03:26.329> the<00:03:26.930> straight<00:03:27.530> line<00:03:28.280> of<00:03:28.310> string

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
is the flat the straight line of string

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.099 
is the flat the straight line of string
always<00:03:29.209> goes<00:03:29.750> over<00:03:30.260> the<00:03:30.620> more<00:03:30.980> curvy<00:03:31.579> one<00:03:31.790> and

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
always goes over the more curvy one and

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:34.479 
always goes over the more curvy one and
it's<00:03:33.109> a<00:03:33.230> little<00:03:33.410> bit<00:03:33.590> hard<00:03:33.829> to<00:03:33.950> watch<00:03:34.130> in<00:03:34.370> the

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
it's a little bit hard to watch in the

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.640 
it's a little bit hard to watch in the
video<00:03:34.760> but<00:03:35.239> once<00:03:35.870> you<00:03:35.989> start<00:03:36.140> making<00:03:36.500> them

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
video but once you start making them

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.729 
video but once you start making them
yourself<00:03:37.069> it'll<00:03:37.370> be<00:03:37.489> really<00:03:37.670> easy<00:03:37.790> to<00:03:38.540> see<00:03:38.810> so

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
yourself it'll be really easy to see so

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.319 
yourself it'll be really easy to see so
here<00:03:40.609> it<00:03:40.700> is<00:03:40.790> again<00:03:41.030> you<00:03:41.440> take<00:03:42.440> that<00:03:42.590> one<00:03:42.829> side

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
here it is again you take that one side

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:47.379 
here it is again you take that one side
fold<00:03:44.329> it<00:03:44.480> over<00:03:45.290> the<00:03:46.130> other<00:03:46.160> side<00:03:46.609> and<00:03:46.910> then

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:47.389 
fold it over the other side and then

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:51.580 
fold it over the other side and then
pull<00:03:47.840> from<00:03:48.139> underneath<00:03:48.760> to<00:03:49.760> make<00:03:50.389> the<00:03:51.230> choker

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
pull from underneath to make the choker

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:57.870 
pull from underneath to make the choker
pattern

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.580 

it<00:03:58.880> is<00:03:59.060> really<00:03:59.270> something<00:03:59.810> that<00:03:59.840> just<00:04:00.170> takes<00:04:00.440> a

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
it is really something that just takes a

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.480 
it is really something that just takes a
lot<00:04:00.800> of<00:04:01.010> time<00:04:01.340> to<00:04:02.120> learn<00:04:02.690> how<00:04:02.870> to<00:04:02.900> do<00:04:03.260> for<00:04:04.130> me<00:04:04.280> it

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:04.490 
lot of time to learn how to do for me it

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.030 
lot of time to learn how to do for me it
took<00:04:04.670> me<00:04:04.820> like<00:04:04.970> two<00:04:05.240> hours<00:04:05.630> to<00:04:06.050> understand<00:04:06.920> how

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
took me like two hours to understand how

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.310 
took me like two hours to understand how
to<00:04:07.130> make<00:04:07.250> my<00:04:07.430> first<00:04:07.730> one<00:04:08.030> but<00:04:08.810> once<00:04:09.140> you

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
to make my first one but once you

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.560 
to make my first one but once you
understand<00:04:09.920> how<00:04:10.010> the<00:04:10.160> pattern<00:04:10.640> works<00:04:10.910> it's<00:04:11.240> so

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
understand how the pattern works it's so

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.840 
understand how the pattern works it's so
easy<00:04:11.930> and<00:04:12.200> it<00:04:12.530> does<00:04:12.680> not<00:04:12.890> take<00:04:13.190> a<00:04:13.220> lot<00:04:13.430> of<00:04:13.610> time

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850 
easy and it does not take a lot of time

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
little loop of the charm and thread the

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.200 
little loop of the charm and thread the
wire<00:04:35.050> of<00:04:35.320> the<00:04:35.350> choker<00:04:35.710> through<00:04:36.460> the<00:04:36.729> loop<00:04:36.940> it's

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
wire of the choker through the loop it's

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.719 
wire of the choker through the loop it's
really<00:04:37.630> easy<00:04:37.900> and<00:04:38.380> then<00:04:39.010> you<00:04:39.220> want<00:04:39.430> to<00:04:39.490> push

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:39.729 
really easy and then you want to push

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:41.460 
really easy and then you want to push
the<00:04:39.910> little<00:04:40.150> charm<00:04:40.449> all<00:04:40.690> the<00:04:40.900> way<00:04:41.020> down<00:04:41.260> to

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
the little charm all the way down to

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.950 
the little charm all the way down to
where<00:04:41.650> the<00:04:41.830> choker<00:04:42.460> pattern<00:04:42.880> is<00:04:43.060> and<00:04:43.360> then

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
where the choker pattern is and then

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.670 
where the choker pattern is and then
just<00:04:44.710> keep<00:04:44.919> leaving<00:04:45.250> the<00:04:45.850> choker<00:04:46.120> as<00:04:46.930> in<00:04:47.560> the

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
just keep leaving the choker as in the

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.370 
just keep leaving the choker as in the
same<00:04:47.919> pattern<00:04:48.220> as<00:04:48.610> you<00:04:48.639> were<00:04:48.910> doing<00:04:49.060> before<00:04:49.810> so

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
same pattern as you were doing before so

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.070 
same pattern as you were doing before so
like<00:04:50.590> you<00:04:50.740> want<00:04:50.919> to<00:04:50.979> go<00:04:51.100> over<00:04:51.400> under<00:04:52.080> same

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
like you want to go over under same

00:04:53.080 --> 00:05:13.110 
like you want to go over under same
thing

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.850 

sometimes<00:05:14.120> what<00:05:14.389> I<00:05:14.420> do<00:05:14.570> is<00:05:14.810> if<00:05:15.290> the<00:05:15.530> choker

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
sometimes what I do is if the choker

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.740 
sometimes what I do is if the choker
gets<00:05:16.160> too<00:05:16.460> long<00:05:16.700> for<00:05:16.910> the<00:05:17.030> piece<00:05:17.210> of<00:05:17.360> paper<00:05:17.540> you

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
gets too long for the piece of paper you

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.750 
gets too long for the piece of paper you
can<00:05:17.780> always<00:05:18.139> just<00:05:18.500> clip<00:05:18.860> the<00:05:19.190> top<00:05:19.520> of<00:05:19.669> the

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 
can always just clip the top of the

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.620 
can always just clip the top of the
choker<00:05:20.000> on<00:05:20.150> to<00:05:20.450> a<00:05:20.480> different<00:05:21.070> substance<00:05:22.070> and

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
choker on to a different substance and

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.350 
choker on to a different substance and
just<00:05:23.630> keep<00:05:23.840> going<00:05:24.169> from<00:05:24.470> there<00:05:24.639> also<00:05:25.639> the

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
just keep going from there also the

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.300 
just keep going from there also the
batteries<00:05:26.840> are<00:05:26.990> there<00:05:27.169> because<00:05:27.380> sometimes

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
batteries are there because sometimes

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.760 
batteries are there because sometimes
the<00:05:28.520> choker<00:05:28.790> like<00:05:29.150> flips<00:05:29.780> on<00:05:29.960> its<00:05:30.110> side<00:05:30.380> while

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
the choker like flips on its side while

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.490 
the choker like flips on its side while
I'm<00:05:30.860> trying<00:05:31.130> to<00:05:31.190> do<00:05:31.400> it<00:05:31.550> so<00:05:32.360> sometimes<00:05:33.200> I'll

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
I'm trying to do it so sometimes I'll

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.409 
I'm trying to do it so sometimes I'll
just<00:05:33.560> take<00:05:33.950> the<00:05:34.160> pack<00:05:34.370> of<00:05:34.520> batteries<00:05:34.730> and<00:05:35.210> put

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:35.419 
just take the pack of batteries and put

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:39.220 
just take the pack of batteries and put
it<00:05:35.480> on<00:05:35.600> top<00:05:35.810> because<00:05:36.190> it<00:05:37.190> stops<00:05:37.970> the<00:05:38.419> rest<00:05:39.080> of

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:39.230 
it on top because it stops the rest of

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.260 
it on top because it stops the rest of
the<00:05:39.320> choker<00:05:39.560> from<00:05:40.040> moving<00:05:40.520> around<00:05:40.820> while

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
the choker from moving around while

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.670 
the choker from moving around while
you're<00:05:41.510> trying<00:05:41.780> to<00:05:42.820> weave<00:05:43.900> okay<00:05:44.900> this<00:05:45.169> part<00:05:45.500> is

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 
you're trying to weave okay this part is

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.590 
you're trying to weave okay this part is
going<00:05:45.980> to<00:05:46.160> be<00:05:46.340> a<00:05:46.370> little<00:05:46.820> bit<00:05:47.030> hard<00:05:47.300> to<00:05:47.390> explain

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:47.600 
going to be a little bit hard to explain

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.650 
going to be a little bit hard to explain
and<00:05:48.410> show<00:05:48.460> but<00:05:49.460> basically<00:05:49.880> when<00:05:50.210> you<00:05:50.360> think

outside of the hoop and one inside and

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.250 
outside of the hoop and one inside and
then<00:06:19.580> next<00:06:19.940> what<00:06:20.090> you<00:06:20.240> want<00:06:20.270> to<00:06:20.540> do<00:06:20.720> is<00:06:20.960> just

then next what you want to do is just

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.640 
then next what you want to do is just
super<00:06:21.919> glue<00:06:22.190> the<00:06:22.970> two<00:06:23.150> ends<00:06:23.510> together<00:06:23.750> you

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:24.650 
super glue the two ends together you

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.340 
super glue the two ends together you
could<00:06:24.770> also<00:06:25.010> use<00:06:25.520> a<00:06:25.550> lighter<00:06:26.090> and<00:06:26.390> fuse<00:06:27.110> them

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:27.350 
could also use a lighter and fuse them

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:30.700 
could also use a lighter and fuse them
like<00:06:27.770> burn<00:06:28.039> them<00:06:28.310> together<00:06:28.630> but<00:06:29.630> I<00:06:29.930> prefer<00:06:30.590> to

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:30.710 
like burn them together but I prefer to

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:32.920 
like burn them together but I prefer to
superglue<00:06:31.039> but<00:06:31.490> I<00:06:31.640> will<00:06:31.820> also<00:06:32.000> show<00:06:32.510> you<00:06:32.570> how

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:32.930 
superglue but I will also show you how

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:36.279 
superglue but I will also show you how
to<00:06:32.990> fuse<00:06:33.590> them<00:06:33.740> together<00:06:33.950> in<00:06:34.400> a<00:06:34.789> minute<00:06:35.289> so

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:36.289 
to fuse them together in a minute so

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:37.900 
to fuse them together in a minute so
basically<00:06:36.680> when<00:06:36.950> you've<00:06:37.070> glued<00:06:37.250> the<00:06:37.430> two<00:06:37.640> ends

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:37.910 
basically when you've glued the two ends

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:39.969 
basically when you've glued the two ends
together<00:06:38.120> you<00:06:38.660> just<00:06:38.690> want<00:06:39.169> to<00:06:39.260> cut<00:06:39.770> off<00:06:39.950> the

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:39.979 
together you just want to cut off the

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:43.600 
together you just want to cut off the
extra<00:06:41.020> pieces<00:06:42.020> that<00:06:42.560> are<00:06:42.680> right<00:06:42.860> there<00:06:43.130> and

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:43.610 
extra pieces that are right there and

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:45.279 
extra pieces that are right there and
obviously<00:06:44.150> you<00:06:44.539> don't<00:06:44.570> want<00:06:44.720> to<00:06:44.870> cut<00:06:45.020> off<00:06:45.169> the

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:45.289 
obviously you don't want to cut off the

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:46.659 
obviously you don't want to cut off the
superglue<00:06:45.710> because<00:06:46.070> that's<00:06:46.220> what's<00:06:46.400> holding

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:46.669 
superglue because that's what's holding

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:49.420 
superglue because that's what's holding
the<00:06:46.760> necklace<00:06:47.090> together<00:06:47.390> and<00:06:48.010> there<00:06:49.010> you<00:06:49.220> have

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:49.430 
the necklace together and there you have

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.070 
the necklace together and there you have
your<00:06:49.760> choker<00:06:50.090> they're<00:06:50.539> actually

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.080 
your choker they're actually

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.070 
your choker they're actually
surprisingly<00:06:51.770> easy<00:06:52.130> to<00:06:52.280> make<00:06:52.610> and<00:06:52.970> I<00:06:53.660> really

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.080 
surprisingly easy to make and I really

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.420 
surprisingly easy to make and I really
like<00:06:54.229> making<00:06:54.500> them<00:06:54.830> and<00:06:55.610> yeah<00:06:56.710> an<00:06:57.710> alternative

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:58.430 
like making them and yeah an alternative

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.640 
like making them and yeah an alternative
way<00:06:58.610> to<00:06:58.669> end<00:06:59.210> the<00:06:59.360> chokers<00:06:59.870> is<00:07:00.200> by<00:07:00.410> just

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:00.650 
way to end the chokers is by just

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:04.330 
way to end the chokers is by just
getting<00:07:00.950> a<00:07:01.039> little<00:07:01.220> lighter<00:07:01.820> and<00:07:03.190> fusing<00:07:04.190> the

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:04.340 
getting a little lighter and fusing the

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.550 
getting a little lighter and fusing the
two<00:07:04.580> ends<00:07:04.970> together<00:07:05.180> just<00:07:05.660> by<00:07:05.840> burning<00:07:06.380> it<00:07:06.500> a

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 
two ends together just by burning it a

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.760 
two ends together just by burning it a
little<00:07:06.800> bit<00:07:07.039> and<00:07:07.400> it<00:07:08.360> might<00:07:08.630> hurt<00:07:08.960> I<00:07:09.320> don't

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:09.770 
little bit and it might hurt I don't

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:11.770 
little bit and it might hurt I don't
know<00:07:09.830> it<00:07:09.979> didn't<00:07:10.160> really<00:07:10.250> hurt<00:07:10.550> me<00:07:10.789> but<00:07:11.150> yeah

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:11.780 
know it didn't really hurt me but yeah

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.060 
know it didn't really hurt me but yeah
all<00:07:11.900> you<00:07:11.990> have<00:07:12.080> to<00:07:12.200> do<00:07:12.350> is<00:07:12.560> get<00:07:12.710> a<00:07:12.740> little<00:07:12.919> bit

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:13.070 
all you have to do is get a little bit

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.520 
all you have to do is get a little bit
of<00:07:13.220> fire<00:07:13.460> and<00:07:13.850> then<00:07:14.120> just<00:07:14.479> pinch<00:07:14.900> the<00:07:15.080> two<00:07:15.260> ends

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:15.530 
of fire and then just pinch the two ends

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:18.159 
of fire and then just pinch the two ends
together<00:07:15.710> and<00:07:16.190> it<00:07:17.150> will<00:07:17.240> stay<00:07:17.539> and<00:07:17.840> create

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:18.169 
together and it will stay and create

00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:20.050 
together and it will stay and create
like<00:07:18.320> a<00:07:18.380> little<00:07:18.470> bonds<00:07:18.979> so<00:07:19.190> that<00:07:19.400> your<00:07:19.700> choker

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:20.060 
like a little bonds so that your choker

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.300 
like a little bonds so that your choker
doesn't

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:21.310 
doesn't

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.860 
doesn't
last<00:07:22.310> thing<00:07:22.460> I<00:07:22.550> have<00:07:22.700> to<00:07:22.850> say<00:07:23.060> is<00:07:23.270> make<00:07:23.510> sure<00:07:23.540> to

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:23.870 
last thing I have to say is make sure to

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:25.870 
last thing I have to say is make sure to
get<00:07:23.990> these<00:07:24.170> two<00:07:24.500> specific<00:07:24.770> kinds<00:07:25.370> of<00:07:25.430> string

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:25.880 
get these two specific kinds of string

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.640 
get these two specific kinds of string
because<00:07:26.600> they're<00:07:26.780> really<00:07:27.050> the<00:07:27.170> only<00:07:27.350> ones

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:27.650 
because they're really the only ones

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:30.100 
because they're really the only ones
that<00:07:27.860> will<00:07:28.010> work<00:07:28.220> and<00:07:28.510> yeah<00:07:29.510> I'm<00:07:29.780> pretty<00:07:29.990> sure

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:30.110
