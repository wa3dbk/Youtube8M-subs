like<00:00:33.600> 48<00:00:34.230> 49<00:00:34.620> -<00:00:35.340> maybe<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.120> mid-50s<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.989> think<00:00:37.140> a

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
like 48 49 - maybe the mid-50s I think a

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.569 
like 48 49 - maybe the mid-50s I think a
good<00:00:37.350> rule<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.590> thumb<00:00:37.710> in<00:00:38.010> general<00:00:38.340> is<00:00:38.550> that

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
good rule of thumb in general is that

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.209 
good rule of thumb in general is that
the<00:00:38.879> lighter<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.329> wine<00:00:39.540> in<00:00:39.870> color<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.800> embody

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
the lighter the wine in color and embody

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.910 
the lighter the wine in color and embody
the<00:00:42.030> cooler<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.690> wine<00:00:42.870> should<00:00:43.170> be<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:43.770> if<00:00:43.829> you

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
the cooler the wine should be so if you

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.650 
the cooler the wine should be so if you
get<00:00:44.070> into<00:00:44.280> like<00:00:44.460> an<00:00:44.670> orange<00:00:44.940> wine<00:00:45.210> which<00:00:45.539> is

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
you can't be totally precise but I think

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.020 
you can't be totally precise but I think
it's<00:01:40.770> all<00:01:40.920> about<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.520> know<00:01:41.610> just<00:01:41.820> kind<00:01:41.939> of

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
it's all about you know just kind of

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.700

eyeballing<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.630> knowing<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.229> your<00:01:43.439> fridge

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
eyeballing it knowing that your fridge

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.760 
eyeballing it knowing that your fridge
is<00:01:44.040> about<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:45.000> know<00:01:45.119> 35<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.840> 40<00:01:46.079> degrees<00:01:46.409> and

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
is about you know 35 to 40 degrees and

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.950 
is about you know 35 to 40 degrees and
so<00:01:47.460> if<00:01:47.579> you<00:01:47.700> pull<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.909> white<00:01:48.180> wine<00:01:48.360> out<00:01:48.570> let<00:01:48.869> it
