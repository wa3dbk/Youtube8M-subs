 Catholic for my father and for me 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:28.480
 faith was always important 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:32.470
 always support us a lot 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:35.500
 Power has given important decisions too 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:38.260
 cases and the responsibility of 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.170
 easier to carry 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.519
 my mother often took us out of the Bible 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:47.710

 I read and I have there 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.780
 felt that these Christian values 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:01.270
 are important for me too 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.370
 company and under its nearly 1800 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.809
 employees want to parents 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.479
 give Christian values eight 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:11.140
 we catch each year we catch the 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:13.420
 first working with a knife to 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:17.920
 not everyone but the church is 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:19.770
 this morning , our crowds are always full 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.380
 staff if they start with us 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.420
 Then we each get one 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.830
 introduction font where our 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.130
 company history our 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.860
 company philosophy also stands the values 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.660
 which are important to us and we have 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.729
 we have there very early 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:42.429
 written that our family the 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:45.009
 Reserves from our company the machines 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:48.149
 the buildings and second not as ours 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:50.740
 property to look at but us 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:54.069
 entrusted to the responsible 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:58.780
 guide and lead and in that sense 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:02:02.120
 We have a company in 2000 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:05.210
 Foundation founded and my siblings 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:08.360
 we are eleven children and my father is mine 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.030
 uncle we have all our stocks in 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.570
 given this company foundation 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:18.230
 that means the value of the company 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:20.570
 is eternal in this foundation 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.900
 the family can no longer care 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:27.740
 grab the remaining ten percent 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:31.400
 are in a charitable foundation and 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.640
 this foundation supports women less 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.050
 Swiss need in the world 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.209
 charitable projects for example in 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.230
 we support a hospital in africa 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.640
 farmers also build water 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.040
 water wells become the violence 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.870
 we support the swiss 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.970
 Penknife does not want parents as 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.709
 weapons understood he has no 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.459
 problem with it as Christians better too 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.420
 Selling 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:59.480
 basically, our vision is real 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.120
 that they are useful companions for ours 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.640
 So I think that customers produce 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.730
 the swiss pocketknife is that 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.610
 really a tool and a worldwide 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.370
 companion for our customers and also 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.480
 if you are, for example 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.060
 weapons law in switzerland or in 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.440
 germany looks and falls ours 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:25.400
 not pocket- down I think 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:28.580
 many everyday objects can be of 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.920
 people are abused 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.680
 also a pocketknife com abused 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.160
 but in principle if they are one 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.900
 View tool from us if you have the 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.450
 booktable at the philips 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.610
 screwdriver then look at the pliers 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.100
 are not all dangerous 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.630
 tools 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.000
 Elsener manages the family business 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:52.150
 in the fourth generation 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.700
 In 2012, he became a Swiss entrepreneur 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.130
 of the year what helps him with all 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:02.440
 to remain humble despite the success 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:05.050
 I think that helps me too now 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.960
 Christian faith on the ground too 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:11.110
 stay and everything always relativized 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:14.530
 to look and I see in mine 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.490
 Daily work all parts are 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.530
 People 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.640
 we have our strengths we have 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.650
 our weaknesses 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:25.030
 i don't think anybody has a reason 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.100
 cocky or arrogant 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.980
 help 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.630
 elsen that children are 14 17 and 20 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.280
 they'll be that once 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.860
 continue family business 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.170
 that one can say today I would say it is 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.960
 a little too early at the song can 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:43.220
 is of course seeing that they are against 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.150
 every doll very crunches the 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:49.560
 of course identified a certain 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:52.260
 proud of that the theater since his father 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.590
 a responsibility in this company 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.590
