00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:08.890
 well super simple but I was not given 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.990
 I want to do it because someone once 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:14.920
 he asked me how to do them with 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.029
 some the hearts between depp and 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.439
 someone who will now come the 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.499
 season in which all go lacke of 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:24.909
 hearts in the nails to me I like this 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:29.310
 color look at me I make them like that he grabbed me 

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:29.310
 a little ball is a little dog 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:37.399
 and with the tip the students puntitas 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.809
 I dont know 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:43.430
 because they are moving to this allows 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.430
 who is the goal that is here 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.140
 d 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.140
 It is a scissor weight 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:56.260
 and leave after 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:59.200
 another that is the same size 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:04.740
 I put them side 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.740
 there are 112 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:14.020
 as you like and I like 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.880
 as I said 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.700
 There are people who do them as well 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.470
 planitos the same to me I like the 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.100
 fat dogs each 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.100
 by my side 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.420
 so it is appreciated 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.110
 bye 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.710
 but in a way to make them I imagine 

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:46.490
 that we all have different techniques 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.490
 to do it 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.300
 and they like them 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:59.000
 and obviously among the biggest heart 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:04.030
 with bigger balls the wounds 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.030
 to make acrylic lists 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.820
 let's make a lot of equipment 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.950
 besides this good 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.800
 A) Yes 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:40.170
 with the constructor so I have 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.630
 very well 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.550
 doves that to share them all is not 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.849
 a great thing but I wanted to share with 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.240
 How do I make hearts and 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.810
 I hope you like it 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.810
 Oh
