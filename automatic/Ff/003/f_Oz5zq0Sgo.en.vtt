00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:14.070
 Today I will tell you about the program about 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:18.330
 free program that will help 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:21.960

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.130
 show which grandmas take more 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.750
 disk space 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.759
 there are two versions free and 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.630
 paid with an extended set 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.910
 we have enough opportunities for home 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.930
 I think free move to 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.930

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.920
 English 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:37.939
 the fact that the Russian language is not very 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.939
 scary because here and so everything is clear 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.420
 put a tick here for the program 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:50.909
 run as administrator 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:57.979
 would have access to all system files 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:57.979
 and folders and goes scanning the disk c 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.580
 all is ready 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:09.550
 we can observe and what we have revealing 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.550
 despite 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:19.349
 Now I will tell you how I found my 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.349
 lost disk space 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:27.370
 I worked in a video editor not a computer 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.350
 issued information that hard place 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:35.920
 only 500 megabytes left 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:38.050
 of 34 and seven free, I usually like 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:42.900
 and now see his place here for a lot 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.900
 less let's see where she got to 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:50.120
 programs user folders while m site 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:03:03.069
 passed folder scan open 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:03:05.499
 the most complete daddy and look the most 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:13.109
 our first list is my video 

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:15.909
 converter reveal temporary daddy 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:20.499
 here we have in the temporary folder almost 4 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:24.250
 gigabytes of busy files so I found 

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:28.139
 your lost 4 gigabytes from the drive become 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:31.480
 they can be removed immediately from the pkm program 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:34.409
 conductors remove but now I have this 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.629
 I will not do that yet I still work 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:41.049
 video editor and then necessarily 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:44.459
