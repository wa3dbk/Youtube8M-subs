00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.750
 or not 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.210
 very good others keep their snacks and 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.790
 up to here same daily video and you 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.980
 here gentlemen with a little knock down and 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:21.590
 of tomahawk map bags that the truth 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.740
 that of another episode that I went up to like 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.150
 most more than 500 likes so nothing 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.009
 thank you very much to all those who 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.050
 vote this taxi that today we are here to 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.630
 show them how to kill the campers who 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.540
 they are placed right in front of the little window 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.700
 As you can see, it seems 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.770
 It has to be because it seeks to destroy 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.600
 you just go out and we come to you here 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.120
 and that 's what they're always out there 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.480
 changing then the work that also 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.519
 it goes with a bounce and it really would be quite 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.949
 epic if you do it and well I wanted 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:53.629
 tell all of you who get it in 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:55.780
 a public game that if there 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.329
 youtube and put it as a response video 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.559
 using these same tricks I tell you 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:03.230
 I will happily accept because the truth is 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.879
 I like you to do these things 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.640
 because they are pretty cool so 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.290
 nothing said if you do not get good then 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.510
 upload it to youtube and put it as 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.780
 video response and good the second trick 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.370
 the second spot is just on the other side 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.060
 to kill the camper from the other corner 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.770
 but 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.680
 You see it costs me a bit to give 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:25.549
 principle I do not give you have to see that 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.500
 the sun gives like three little things like three 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.740
 shines and you have to put it right in 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:33.830
 the third starting from the right and 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.420
 on top of the tower that a bit 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.880
 nose above the house that has 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.039
 just opposite and it's a bit of practice 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.630
 but in the end it will not end up coming out and 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:43.970
 the truth is that it is pretty enough 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.369
 cool because it gives several rebounds even 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.500
 until the end kill him 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.179
 that's campers that are always there already 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.740
 they will not be back and you'll see 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:55.729
 thanks to these tricks and good if 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.560
 we went to put the pump and that you have 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.409
 that just put the bomb here and you 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.720
 you have to put behind behind the 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:05.030
 truck where the wheel can stop it 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.259
 to see it perfectly and there right 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.989
 you have to go to the fireplace 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:11.480
 that and several rebounds will end 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:14.390
 giving him that is do not stop because that to me 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.400
 I did not go out and say yes so good if 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.900
 you can appreciate it 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.790
 perfectly and then this is the last 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.530
 I 'm going to teach you in this 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.660
 case in the other bomb 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.360
 this is more more practical easier to 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.300
 learn because you just have to put on 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.950
 just below the step that view there's 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:34.100
 a good step because you have to 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.200
 fix and you get a tad and you have low 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.800
 to go down you have to be below the 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.950
 step down and just what you have 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.290
 to strain between those two slits 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.700
 what's in between that window so 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.530
 Well I hope you liked the video 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.690
 that you voted that you value the effort 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.700
 that does not always come to the first and 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.860
 you have to find the spots trying 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.900
 and testing and you see several various bounces 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.760
 so nothing I would like you to vote the 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.650
 video if you liked it and what we said 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.650
 we see next Saturday and see you later
