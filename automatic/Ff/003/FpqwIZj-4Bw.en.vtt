00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
you get is you get a choice we can do

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.420 
you get is you get a choice we can do
with<00:02:52.270> shadows<00:02:52.810> mid-tones<00:02:53.320> or<00:02:53.800> highlights

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
with shadows mid-tones or highlights

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.280 
with shadows mid-tones or highlights
which<00:02:55.270> just<00:02:55.480> really<00:02:55.660> makes<00:02:55.960> it<00:02:56.050> a<00:02:56.140> bit

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
which just really makes it a bit

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.070 
which just really makes it a bit
difficult<00:02:56.520> so<00:02:57.520> what<00:02:57.700> I'm<00:02:57.790> going<00:02:57.940> to<00:02:57.970> do<00:02:58.150> is<00:02:58.420> I'm

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
difficult so what I'm going to do is I'm

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.630 
difficult so what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:02:59.560> to<00:02:59.680> zoom<00:03:00.100> in<00:03:00.280> on<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:01.180> face<00:03:01.330> a<00:03:01.390> bit<00:03:01.600> more

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
going to zoom in on the face a bit more

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.740 
going to zoom in on the face a bit more
there<00:03:03.640> you<00:03:03.850> can<00:03:03.970> see<00:03:04.180> it<00:03:04.330> looks<00:03:04.450> like<00:03:04.570> I've

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
there you can see it looks like I've

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.660 
there you can see it looks like I've
just<00:03:05.080> got<00:03:05.230> a<00:03:05.260> bit<00:03:05.350> of<00:03:05.440> a<00:03:05.470> sunburn<00:03:05.770> in<00:03:06.160> the<00:03:06.460> face

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
just got a bit of a sunburn in the face

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.260 
just got a bit of a sunburn in the face
so<00:03:07.660> let's<00:03:08.620> carry<00:03:08.860> on<00:03:08.980> with<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:09.790> color<00:03:10.060> balance

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
so let's carry on with the color balance

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.530 
so let's carry on with the color balance
and<00:03:10.950> have<00:03:11.950> a<00:03:12.010> bit<00:03:12.160> more<00:03:12.190> pink<00:03:12.640> what<00:03:13.060> I<00:03:13.090> want<00:03:13.420> to

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
and have a bit more pink what I want to

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.800 
and have a bit more pink what I want to
do<00:03:13.810> is<00:03:14.220> take<00:03:15.220> a<00:03:15.280> bit<00:03:15.640> of<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:15.910> red<00:03:16.090> down<00:03:16.420> some

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
do is take a bit of the red down some

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.920 
do is take a bit of the red down some
more<00:03:16.990> cyan<00:03:17.880> add<00:03:18.880> a<00:03:19.300> bit<00:03:19.510> more<00:03:19.650> green<00:03:20.650> to<00:03:20.950> it<00:03:21.070> and

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
more cyan add a bit more green to it and

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.990 
more cyan add a bit more green to it and
maybe<00:03:22.930> add<00:03:23.350> a<00:03:23.710> little<00:03:23.740> bit<00:03:24.100> more<00:03:24.360> diluted<00:03:27.000> or

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
maybe add a little bit more diluted or

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.840 
maybe add a little bit more diluted or
maybe<00:03:28.240> a<00:03:28.270> little<00:03:28.330> bit<00:03:28.540> less<00:03:28.780> blue<00:03:29.820> what<00:03:30.820> you

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
maybe a little bit less blue what you

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.640 
maybe a little bit less blue what you
really<00:03:31.000> need<00:03:31.180> to<00:03:31.240> do<00:03:31.300> is<00:03:31.540> just<00:03:31.810> play<00:03:32.380> around

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
really need to do is just play around

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.010 
really need to do is just play around
with<00:03:32.860> these<00:03:33.100> and<00:03:33.340> practice<00:03:33.850> until<00:03:34.150> you've<00:03:34.780> got

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 
with these and practice until you've got

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.750 
with these and practice until you've got
the<00:03:35.170> right<00:03:37.140> figure<00:03:38.140> this<00:03:39.100> is<00:03:39.160> where<00:03:39.460> if<00:03:39.640> you're

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
the right figure this is where if you're

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.460 
the right figure this is where if you're
an<00:03:39.880> artist<00:03:40.240> you<00:03:40.420> could<00:03:40.540> probably<00:03:40.750> understand

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
an artist you could probably understand

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.610 
an artist you could probably understand
the<00:03:41.560> colors<00:03:41.860> a<00:03:41.890> lot<00:03:42.160> better<00:03:43.110> okay<00:03:44.110> and<00:03:44.560> I'd

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
the colors a lot better okay and I'd

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.260 
the colors a lot better okay and I'd
probably<00:03:44.860> say<00:03:45.100> that<00:03:45.310> there<00:03:45.670> is<00:03:46.000> probably

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.270 
probably say that there is probably

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.380 
probably say that there is probably
about<00:03:46.360> as<00:03:46.540> close<00:03:46.810> as<00:03:46.870> I'm<00:03:47.200> going<00:03:47.440> to<00:03:47.530> get<00:03:48.390> to

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
about as close as I'm going to get to

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.170 
about as close as I'm going to get to
the<00:03:49.570> color<00:03:49.780> of<00:03:49.930> Kim's<00:03:50.110> face<00:03:50.350> so<00:03:50.880> let's<00:03:51.880> press

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
the color of Kim's face so let's press

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.430 
the color of Kim's face so let's press
ok<00:03:52.720> and<00:03:53.709> then<00:03:54.640> let's<00:03:54.970> just<00:03:55.090> paint<00:03:55.510> back<00:03:55.780> in<00:03:56.050> the

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
ok and then let's just paint back in the

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:02.030 
ok and then let's just paint back in the
rest<00:03:57.010> of<00:03:57.540> my<00:03:58.540> face<00:03:58.840> just<00:03:59.200> so<00:03:59.260> it's<00:03:59.530> filly<00:03:59.739> done

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.050 

make<00:04:03.040> sure<00:04:03.220> you're<00:04:03.400> on<00:04:03.430> the<00:04:03.940> layer<00:04:04.810> mask<00:04:05.050> and

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
make sure you're on the layer mask and

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.690 
make sure you're on the layer mask and
you<00:04:07.060> can<00:04:07.090> paint<00:04:07.750> it<00:04:07.900> it<00:04:09.330> so<00:04:10.330> there<00:04:10.750> is<00:04:11.130> my<00:04:12.130> face

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
you can paint it it so there is my face

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.930 
you can paint it it so there is my face
on<00:04:13.120> my<00:04:13.930> graph<00:04:14.080> if<00:04:14.200> I<00:04:14.320> go<00:04:14.470> to<00:04:14.530> loo<00:04:14.950> what<00:04:15.489> happens

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
on my graph if I go to loo what happens

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.170 
on my graph if I go to loo what happens
is<00:04:16.150> I<00:04:16.180> start<00:04:16.510> bringing<00:04:16.930> in<00:04:17.020> my<00:04:17.470> chin<00:04:18.180> which

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
is I start bringing in my chin which

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.789 
is I start bringing in my chin which
isn't<00:04:19.630> receive<00:04:20.080> I<00:04:20.200> could<00:04:20.350> go<00:04:20.530> all<00:04:20.650> the<00:04:20.770> way

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
isn't receive I could go all the way

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.200 
isn't receive I could go all the way
here<00:04:21.130> what<00:04:21.430> will<00:04:21.580> happen<00:04:21.820> is<00:04:21.940> you'll<00:04:22.120> start

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
here what will happen is you'll start

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.840 
here what will happen is you'll start
taking<00:04:22.660> away<00:04:22.800> parts<00:04:23.800> of<00:04:23.890> Kim<00:04:24.130> and<00:04:24.280> it<00:04:24.640> really

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
taking away parts of Kim and it really

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.170 
taking away parts of Kim and it really
doesn't<00:04:25.210> like<00:04:25.270> me<00:04:26.580> but<00:04:27.580> all<00:04:27.790> you<00:04:27.970> do<00:04:28.120> is

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
doesn't like me but all you do is

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.400 
doesn't like me but all you do is
control<00:04:28.570> Zed<00:04:28.750> and<00:04:28.930> that<00:04:29.020> gets<00:04:29.200> rid<00:04:29.290> of<00:04:29.350> that

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
control Zed and that gets rid of that

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.860 
control Zed and that gets rid of that
bit<00:04:29.650> and<00:04:29.800> we<00:04:30.070> can<00:04:30.190> just<00:04:30.370> paint<00:04:30.580> back<00:04:30.790> in<00:04:31.030> the

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
bit and we can just paint back in the

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.650 
bit and we can just paint back in the
bits<00:04:32.080> that<00:04:32.200> we<00:04:32.350> want<00:04:32.530> just<00:04:33.060> bring<00:04:34.060> it<00:04:34.150> close<00:04:34.630> to

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
bits that we want just bring it close to

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.490 
bits that we want just bring it close to
the<00:04:35.290> edges<00:04:35.770> all<00:04:36.520> the<00:04:36.790> way<00:04:36.940> and<00:04:37.900> you<00:04:38.050> can<00:04:38.080> use

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
the edges all the way and you can use

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.460 
the edges all the way and you can use
the<00:04:39.060> fuzzy<00:04:40.060> brush<00:04:40.419> like<00:04:40.750> what<00:04:40.930> I'm<00:04:41.050> using<00:04:41.200> just

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
the fuzzy brush like what I'm using just

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.430 
the fuzzy brush like what I'm using just
now<00:04:41.590> then<00:04:42.220> the<00:04:43.410> join<00:04:44.410> between<00:04:45.030> your<00:04:46.030> face<00:04:46.330> and

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
now then the join between your face and

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
you can also do is go to filter go to

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.770 
you can also do is go to filter go to
distort<00:05:18.100> and<00:05:18.880> what<00:05:19.000> we'll<00:05:19.120> do<00:05:19.240> is<00:05:19.449> I'll<00:05:19.570> make<00:05:19.630> a

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
distort and what we'll do is I'll make a

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.400 
distort and what we'll do is I'll make a
little<00:05:19.960> selection<00:05:20.380> around<00:05:21.130> the<00:05:21.580> eyes<00:05:22.229> just<00:05:23.229> do

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
little selection around the eyes just do

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.570 
little selection around the eyes just do
that<00:05:23.590> I'm<00:05:24.580> gonna<00:05:24.789> go<00:05:24.880> to<00:05:24.940> filter<00:05:25.949> distort<00:05:26.949> and

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
that I'm gonna go to filter distort and

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.370 
that I'm gonna go to filter distort and
go<00:05:28.270> to<00:05:28.330> warp<00:05:28.720> ah

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.420 

so<00:05:32.380> let's<00:05:32.590> flatten<00:05:32.919> it<00:05:33.250> or<00:05:33.940> let's<00:05:34.240> leave<00:05:34.509> them

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
so let's flatten it or let's leave them

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.189 
so let's flatten it or let's leave them
apply<00:05:36.430> layer<00:05:37.090> mask<00:05:37.360> now<00:05:38.350> we'll<00:05:38.530> go<00:05:38.620> to<00:05:38.650> filters

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:40.199 
apply layer mask now we'll go to filters

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:45.029 
apply layer mask now we'll go to filters
distort<00:05:41.199> then<00:05:42.190> warp<00:05:43.440> what<00:05:44.440> we<00:05:44.530> can<00:05:44.650> do<00:05:44.770> is<00:05:44.949> we

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039 
distort then warp what we can do is we

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:47.070 
distort then warp what we can do is we
can<00:05:45.190> click<00:05:45.580> grow<00:05:45.910> I'm<00:05:46.060> gonna<00:05:46.240> make<00:05:46.360> me<00:05:46.539> so<00:05:46.930> have

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
can click grow I'm gonna make me so have

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.990 
can click grow I'm gonna make me so have
really<00:05:47.440> big<00:05:47.800> eyes<00:05:48.010> so<00:05:48.430> it<00:05:48.490> looks<00:05:48.639> like<00:05:48.789> Lady

right in a circle

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:08.700 
right in a circle
take<00:06:03.039> okay<00:06:05.099> then<00:06:06.099> there<00:06:06.370> is<00:06:07.300> me<00:06:07.660> with<00:06:08.470> some

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:12.389 
really kind of messed up eyes just now

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:14.879 
really kind of messed up eyes just now
the<00:06:13.389> next<00:06:13.690> thing<00:06:13.780> we<00:06:13.870> could<00:06:14.020> do<00:06:14.169> is<00:06:14.410> you<00:06:14.590> could

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:14.889 
the next thing we could do is you could

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:18.750 
the next thing we could do is you could
select<00:06:15.340> part<00:06:15.849> of<00:06:15.940> the<00:06:16.000> mouth<00:06:17.370> go<00:06:18.370> to<00:06:18.430> tools

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:18.760 
select part of the mouth go to tools

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.469 
select part of the mouth go to tools
alright<00:06:19.330> so<00:06:19.539> go<00:06:19.930> to<00:06:19.990> filters<00:06:20.310> distort<00:06:21.310> and<00:06:22.240> we

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:22.479 
alright so go to filters distort and we

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:27.330 
alright so go to filters distort and we
can<00:06:22.660> do<00:06:23.849> let's<00:06:24.849> do<00:06:25.090> warp<00:06:25.539> again<00:06:25.949> and<00:06:26.949> this<00:06:27.280> time

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:27.340 
can do let's do warp again and this time

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:35.460 
can do let's do warp again and this time
we're<00:06:27.699> going<00:06:27.820> a<00:06:29.610> small<00:06:30.610> mouth<00:06:34.020> and<00:06:35.020> we<00:06:35.169> just<00:06:35.349> go

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:35.470 
we're going a small mouth and we just go

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:37.589 
we're going a small mouth and we just go
up<00:06:35.620> a<00:06:35.740> long<00:06:35.919> long<00:06:36.159> until<00:06:36.820> I've<00:06:36.909> got<00:06:37.090> nearly<00:06:37.360> no

00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:37.599 
up a long long until I've got nearly no

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:40.770 
up a long long until I've got nearly no
lips<00:06:38.760> now<00:06:39.760> another<00:06:40.150> thing<00:06:40.270> with<00:06:40.479> it<00:06:40.570> let's

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:40.780 
lips now another thing with it let's

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:45.960 
lips now another thing with it let's
work<00:06:41.080> on<00:06:41.380> my<00:06:41.620> nose<00:06:44.220> let's<00:06:45.220> give<00:06:45.550> it<00:06:45.580> so<00:06:45.880> I've

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.510 
work on my nose let's give it so I've
got<00:06:46.120> less<00:06:46.330> of<00:06:46.449> an<00:06:46.539> upturned<00:06:47.289> nose<00:06:47.650> that's<00:06:48.340> good

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:48.520 
got less of an upturned nose that's good

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.750 
got less of an upturned nose that's good
to<00:06:48.639> distort<00:06:49.229> warp<00:06:50.229> on<00:06:50.440> the<00:06:50.830> nose<00:06:50.979> I<00:06:51.220> will<00:06:51.550> click

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:51.760 
to distort warp on the nose I will click

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.960 
to distort warp on the nose I will click
move<00:06:52.169> what<00:06:53.169> we'll<00:06:53.289> do<00:06:53.409> is<00:06:53.650> we'll<00:06:53.889> increase<00:06:54.669> the

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:54.970 
move what we'll do is we'll increase the

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:58.409 
move what we'll do is we'll increase the
blur<00:06:55.419> radius<00:06:55.449> of<00:06:56.260> it<00:06:56.590> and<00:06:56.909> we'll<00:06:57.909> bring<00:06:58.120> the

00:06:58.409 --> 00:06:58.419 
blur radius of it and we'll bring the

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:02.490 
blur radius of it and we'll bring the
bottom<00:06:58.840> part<00:06:59.080> my<00:06:59.169> nose<00:06:59.349> up<00:06:59.620> like<00:07:00.190> that<00:07:01.500> maybe

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:02.500 
bottom part my nose up like that maybe

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.680 
bottom part my nose up like that maybe
we<00:07:02.650> should<00:07:02.800> also<00:07:03.030> do<00:07:04.030> something<00:07:04.300> with<00:07:04.510> my

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:04.690 
we should also do something with my

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:07.529 
we should also do something with my
eyebrows<00:07:05.380> ethic<00:07:05.889> let's<00:07:06.789> give<00:07:06.970> me<00:07:07.030> some<00:07:07.180> evil

00:07:07.529 --> 00:07:07.539 
eyebrows ethic let's give me some evil

00:07:07.539 --> 00:07:11.480 
eyebrows ethic let's give me some evil
eyebrows<00:07:07.930> so<00:07:08.260> go<00:07:08.349> to<00:07:08.409> to<00:07:08.729> filters<00:07:10.229> distort

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:11.490 
eyebrows so go to to filters distort

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:17.120 
eyebrows so go to to filters distort
warp<00:07:12.490> again<00:07:12.699> this<00:07:13.449> time<00:07:14.409> let's<00:07:14.949> do<00:07:15.449> move<00:07:16.449> and

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:17.130 
warp again this time let's do move and

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:20.070 
warp again this time let's do move and
you<00:07:18.130> start<00:07:18.370> now<00:07:18.550> right<00:07:18.580> and<00:07:18.969> push<00:07:19.210> up

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:20.080 
you start now right and push up

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:26.629 
you start now right and push up
so<00:07:20.860> I<00:07:20.949> wrote<00:07:21.310> up<00:07:21.729> that<00:07:22.680> cool<00:07:25.080> go<00:07:26.080> to<00:07:26.139> site

00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:26.639 
so I wrote up that cool go to site

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:32.189 
so I wrote up that cool go to site
select<00:07:27.639> none<00:07:28.199> and<00:07:29.199> then<00:07:30.509> let's<00:07:31.509> leave<00:07:31.900> it<00:07:32.080> as

00:07:32.189 --> 00:07:32.199 
select none and then let's leave it as

00:07:32.199 --> 00:07:33.689 
select none and then let's leave it as
that<00:07:32.470> I<00:07:32.500> think<00:07:32.740> that's<00:07:32.860> pretty<00:07:32.979> good<00:07:33.220> with<00:07:33.669> a

00:07:33.689 --> 00:07:33.699 
that I think that's pretty good with a
