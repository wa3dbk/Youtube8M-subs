through<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.820> valve<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:13.400> allows<00:01:14.400> for

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
through a valve that allows for

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.890 
through a valve that allows for
dampening<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.330> dampening<00:01:15.720> is

compression dampening and this reservoir

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.770 
compression dampening and this reservoir
allows<00:01:21.960> for<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:23.040> greater<00:01:23.729> capacity<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.479> oil

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
allows for a greater capacity of oil

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.350 
allows for a greater capacity of oil
which<00:01:25.110> keeps<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.500> oil<00:01:25.799> cooler<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.400> makes

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
which keeps that oil cooler and makes

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.020 
which keeps that oil cooler and makes
the<00:01:27.840> shocks<00:01:28.500> more<00:01:28.799> consistent<00:01:29.369> over<00:01:29.549> time<00:01:29.579> as

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
the shocks more consistent over time as

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.090 
the shocks more consistent over time as
they<00:01:30.150> eat<00:01:30.329> up<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.900> all<00:01:31.380> doesn't<00:01:31.619> get<00:01:31.890> as<00:01:31.950> hot

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
they eat up that all doesn't get as hot

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.280 
they eat up that all doesn't get as hot
doesn't<00:01:32.400> change<00:01:32.700> viscosity<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:33.930> that's<00:01:34.110> what

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
doesn't change viscosity so that's what

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.130 
doesn't change viscosity so that's what
the<00:01:34.380> remote<00:01:34.680> reservoirs<00:01:35.159> are<00:01:35.369> about<00:01:36.140> aluminum
