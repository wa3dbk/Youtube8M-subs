Brookside for many years was kind of an

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.490 
Brookside for many years was kind of an
underdog<00:00:20.369> in<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.850> system<00:00:21.270> there<00:00:21.900> was<00:00:22.110> a<00:00:22.140> time

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
underdog in the system there was a time

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.140 
underdog in the system there was a time
where<00:00:22.950> teachers<00:00:23.190> just<00:00:23.550> went<00:00:23.820> into<00:00:23.940> their

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
where teachers just went into their

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.900 
where teachers just went into their
classrooms<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:24.960> closed<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.410> door<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.920> they

classrooms and closed the door and they

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.330 
classrooms and closed the door and they
didn't<00:00:27.300> associate<00:00:27.900> with<00:00:28.350> anyone<00:00:28.800> even<00:00:29.100> on

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
sharing that and that's just an awful

sharing that and that's just an awful
situation<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.850> work<00:00:39.030> in<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.540> answer<00:00:39.900> was<00:00:40.050> the

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
situation to work in the answer was the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.900 
situation to work in the answer was the
teacher<00:00:40.350> two<00:00:40.590> safeties<00:00:40.920> these<00:00:41.160> kids<00:00:41.400> can't<00:00:41.730> do

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
teacher two safeties these kids can't do

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.750 
teacher two safeties these kids can't do
it<00:00:42.059> we<00:00:42.809> can't<00:00:43.110> give<00:00:43.290> them<00:00:43.440> hard<00:00:43.710> work<00:00:44.070> because

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
it we can't give them hard work because

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.450 
it we can't give them hard work because
they<00:00:44.940> just<00:00:45.210> can't<00:00:45.480> do<00:00:45.720> it<00:00:45.980> it<00:00:46.980> was<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.220> little

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
they just can't do it it was a little

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.700 
they just can't do it it was a little
bit<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.580> a<00:00:47.670> struggle<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.180> turn<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.710> thought

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
bit of a struggle to turn that thought

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.790 
bit of a struggle to turn that thought
around<00:00:50.100> but<00:00:50.430> eventually<00:00:51.120> they<00:00:51.989> did<00:00:52.229> I<00:00:52.500> think

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
around but eventually they did I think

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.210 
around but eventually they did I think
it<00:00:52.890> starts<00:00:53.220> from<00:00:53.400> the<00:00:53.760> top<00:00:53.879> mr.<00:00:54.510> hey<00:00:54.949> he's<00:00:55.949> done

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.220 
it starts from the top mr. hey he's done

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.850 
it starts from the top mr. hey he's done
a<00:00:56.250> great<00:00:56.519> job<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.820> leading<00:00:57.089> us<00:00:57.589> making<00:00:58.589> others

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.860 
a great job of leading us making others

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.729 
a great job of leading us making others
reach<00:00:59.070> for<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.400> higher<00:00:59.430> standards<00:01:00.150> and<00:01:00.739> having

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
reach for a higher standards and having

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.259 
reach for a higher standards and having
us<00:01:01.860> pressing<00:01:02.339> onto<00:01:02.580> the<00:01:02.760> kids<00:01:02.940> as<00:01:03.089> well

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
us pressing onto the kids as well

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:04.880 
us pressing onto the kids as well
probably<00:01:03.900> one<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.199> critical<00:01:04.440> things<00:01:04.589> that

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
probably one of the critical things that

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.610 
probably one of the critical things that
we<00:01:05.010> did<00:01:05.159> was<00:01:05.339> simply<00:01:05.640> say<00:01:06.270> our<00:01:07.020> students<00:01:07.409> can

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:07.620 
we did was simply say our students can

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.560 
we did was simply say our students can
do<00:01:07.770> better<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.190> really<00:01:08.430> believe<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:08.790> he

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
do better to really believe that he

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.710 
do better to really believe that he
really<00:01:10.140> has<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.320> way<00:01:10.440> about<00:01:10.590> him<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.250> just

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
really has a way about him that is just

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.139 
really has a way about him that is just
he<00:01:12.720> really<00:01:12.930> coax<00:01:13.650> his<00:01:13.890> people<00:01:14.190> along<00:01:14.490> in<00:01:14.820> a

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149 
he really coax his people along in a

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:18.139 
he really coax his people along in a
very<00:01:15.360> subtle<00:01:15.600> way<00:01:16.189> to<00:01:17.189> jump<00:01:17.579> on<00:01:17.729> board<00:01:17.939> with

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:18.149 
very subtle way to jump on board with

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:20.359 
very subtle way to jump on board with
him<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.810> have<00:01:18.990> someone<00:01:19.439> acknowledge<00:01:20.219> our

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
good real I think it has really just

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.130 
good real I think it has really just
changed<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.149> whole<00:01:27.270> atmosphere<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:28.020> this

changed the whole atmosphere of this

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.929 
changed the whole atmosphere of this

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
most of times he'll throw it out there

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.639 
most of times he'll throw it out there
and<00:01:38.549> he<00:01:39.299> knows<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.509> people<00:01:39.810> step<00:01:40.259> up<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.590> get

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
basically takes place because you're

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.639 
basically takes place because you're
willing<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.700> give<00:01:44.850> up<00:01:45.030> power<00:01:45.270> as<00:01:45.659> an

is<00:01:51.689> much<00:01:51.869> more<00:01:52.020> powerful<00:01:52.079> than<00:01:52.619> one<00:01:52.770> person
