00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:07.390
 or the end is this is my aquarium 

00:00:03.249 --> 00:00:09.820
 160 liters as some will remember me 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.799
 they gave it after starting the channel and 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.379
 I already came with some problems like 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:15.940
 example the green dot algae that are 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:19.119
 very difficult to eradicate but 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:23.519
 impossible and some incompatible fish 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.519
 besides that they already came with problems 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.930
 the aquarium water of course was 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.460
 in bad conditions around here you can see 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.460
 all green dots there 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.449
 and my goal with this aquarium in a 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:46.399
 principle was in a thrifty way 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:46.399
 without spending money since I did not have it 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.440
 and repairing all the problems that 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.440
 I had the aquarium 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.739
 however with the passage of the months very 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.530
 well I 'm realizing that the 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.379
 illumination 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.390
 and the quality of the water are still not 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.260
 in its ideal conditions still doing 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:09.340
 the changes every week 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:12.700
 in cases like this the ideal let's say is 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:15.010
 change the lighting because the year of 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.410
 use it more or less or maybe something less 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.240
 it is supposed to be changed but in 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.780
 this case as there is no money can not be 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.130
 change and then another added would be to put 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.159
 fertilizer 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:30.159
 in this case I am using fertilizers 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:32.090
 in pills that is not the best but of 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.640
 moment is what I have 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.280
 then the idea for this aquarium the 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.150
 current idea will be to remove all 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.760
 possible snails as you are seeing 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.230
 and go putting plants fast 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.510
 increase 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.820
 right now I only have the tail of 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.790
 fox and I'll try to put it in the 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.380
 three aquariums to see if he throws in there with this 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.960
 We will try to solve the problem of 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.030
 the green point algae since the 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.630
 fast-growing plants will absorb 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.830
 the nutrients that those algae need 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.350
 narrowing all the snails in the 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.840
 small aquarium of 40 liters and record 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.490
 for all the plants as you see for 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.280
 find some little snail 'between 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.860
 the leaves registering everywhere 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.110
 we will find the odd prize 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.120
 I'm going to clean with my fingers a 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.610
 little bit about the leaves that have something 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.970
 of brown seaweed this is removed very 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.700
 easily like that but what is the point 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.130
 green will not be removed these sheets will 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.440
 they will remain like this forever 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.890
 cleaning the leaves with your fingers is not a 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.590
 advice that usually gives because although 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.900
 seems very effective in the beginning to the 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.780
 long it is not and in addition it becomes very 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.850
 Heavy theirs is not to leave algae 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.710
 the leaves the truth is that the aquarium 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.930
 it is a shame and does not respond 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.970
 much less equally well to the 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.070
 same care that I give to the aquarium of 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.380
 60 liters it is clear that in this aquarium 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.270
 you should need some potassium and 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.070
 while we get it and we are not going to 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.890
 try to mitigate the problem with the tail 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.390
 of fox we go to my aquarium of 60 liters 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.160
 that in sight is 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.140
 it's much greener and we're also going to 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.450
 remove all the snails that we can 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.250
 we will take them out and take them to 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.280
 40 liter aquarium where it is going to roll 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.290
 a good charcoal soup I know myself very 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.330
 well to these little bastards and the 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.330
 very well very well everywhere 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.470
 and I had to leave it there it is 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.780
 a leaf of lettuce a leaf of lettuce 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.400
 so that the snails go to commercial 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.129
 at night and in the morning when I 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.019
 I picked up those that have been left 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:48.180
 another part we are going to prune the tail of 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.730
 fox and we're going to throw him in the others 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.920
 two aquariums this should result in 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.170
 a reduction of algae and especially 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.060
 the green dot with regard to the subscriber 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.739
 as we have been saying we will talk more 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.000
 go ahead when you can and with the 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.430
 lighting also later 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.530
 we will put a lamp of five of those 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.480
 who bought cheap because that's how it's been 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.010
 the aquarium we have finished the video and 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.950
 I'm going to cross my fingers so that 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.989
 all this work chau kervin is 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:16.130
 thanks for being there and being the best 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.130
 subscribers of the world 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:46.889
 yes
