00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
like Godzilla very much but I didn't

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
feel like the character development was

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.760 
feel like the character development was
the<00:00:38.570> strength<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.899> film<00:00:40.140> some<00:00:40.530> people

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
the strength of the film some people

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.930 
the strength of the film some people
would<00:00:40.829> say<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:41.070> was<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.219> weakness<00:00:41.430> but<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:41.790> didn't

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940

would say it was a weakness but I didn't
really<00:00:42.030> think<00:00:42.120> it's<00:00:42.329> right<00:00:42.450> but<00:00:42.570> on<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.780> other

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
really think it's right but on the other

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.459 
really think it's right but on the other
hand<00:00:42.989> ever<00:00:43.860> since<00:00:44.129> this<00:00:44.309> dude<00:00:44.640> made<00:00:44.879> monsters
