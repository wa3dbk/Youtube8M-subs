me so I don't run that front peg so what

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.179 
me so I don't run that front peg so what
I'd<00:01:05.489> say<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:06.180> have<00:01:07.140> your<00:01:07.380> front<00:01:07.650> Smith's<00:01:08.299> good

because<00:01:11.189> kind<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.869> really<00:01:12.869> just<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.200> front

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
because kind of really just the front

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:24.740 
because kind of really just the front
Smith<00:01:21.409> and<00:01:22.409> then<00:01:22.619> after<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.509> once<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.659> have

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
Smith and then after that once you have

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.960 
Smith and then after that once you have
your<00:01:24.900> front<00:01:25.110> crook<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.860> can<00:01:26.369> do<00:01:26.490> front<00:01:26.759> side

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
your front crook you can do front side

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.870 
your front crook you can do front side
nose<00:01:27.240> once<00:01:27.770> which<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.920> just<00:01:29.189> learned<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.790> I'm

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
nose once which I just learned and I'm

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.560 
nose once which I just learned and I'm
not<00:01:30.000> very<00:01:30.150> good<00:01:30.270> at<00:01:30.420> yet

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
not very good at yet

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:38.250 
not very good at yet
so<00:01:35.140> what<00:01:36.140> I<00:01:36.170> went<00:01:36.470> about<00:01:36.740> to<00:01:36.980> do<00:01:37.130> this<00:01:37.310> I

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.260 
so what I went about to do this I

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.560 
so what I went about to do this I
learned<00:01:39.260> it<00:01:39.530> on<00:01:39.800> a<00:01:40.340> grunt<00:01:40.700> box<00:01:40.940> very<00:01:41.150> similar

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
learned it on a grunt box very similar

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.600 
learned it on a grunt box very similar
this<00:01:41.870> it<00:01:42.110> was<00:01:42.200> low<00:01:42.460> aah

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
this it was low aah

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.969 
this it was low aah
I<00:01:45.580> started<00:01:46.580> out<00:01:46.700> maybe<00:01:47.360> grind<00:01:47.720> in<00:01:47.930> the<00:01:48.740> last

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
I started out maybe grind in the last

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.940 
I started out maybe grind in the last
foot<00:01:49.430> going<00:01:50.090> fast<00:01:50.479> just<00:01:50.930> to<00:01:50.990> get<00:01:51.140> the<00:01:51.290> feel<00:01:51.920> of

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
foot going fast just to get the feel of

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.980 
foot going fast just to get the feel of
getting<00:01:52.490> into<00:01:52.670> it<00:01:52.970> not<00:01:53.390> really

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
getting into it not really

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.770 
getting into it not really
locking<00:01:54.770> in<00:01:54.950> I'm<00:01:55.160> kind<00:01:55.369> of<00:01:55.460> just<00:01:55.640> kissing<00:01:56.180> the

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
locking in I'm kind of just kissing the

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.020 
locking in I'm kind of just kissing the
rail<00:01:56.960> I<00:01:56.990> guess<00:01:57.290> you<00:01:57.410> could<00:01:57.560> say<00:01:57.610> and<00:01:58.610> then<00:01:58.760> from

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
rail I guess you could say and then from

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.180 
rail I guess you could say and then from
there<00:01:59.210> you<00:01:59.900> can<00:01:59.960> go<00:02:00.140> further<00:02:00.380> and<00:02:00.619> further

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.199 

balancing<00:02:04.190> in<00:02:04.310> this<00:02:04.460> is<00:02:04.759> difficult<00:02:07.060> you<00:02:08.060> know

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
balancing in this is difficult you know

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.720 
balancing in this is difficult you know
I<00:02:08.800> just<00:02:09.800> try<00:02:10.239> to<00:02:11.239> get<00:02:11.450> into<00:02:12.050> a<00:02:12.080> spot<00:02:12.440> that<00:02:12.800> is

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
I just try to get into a spot that is

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.930 
I just try to get into a spot that is
comfortable<00:02:14.239> and<00:02:14.830> you<00:02:15.830> know<00:02:15.950> I<00:02:16.280> get<00:02:16.670> a<00:02:16.700> little

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
comfortable and you know I get a little

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.240 
comfortable and you know I get a little
shake<00:02:17.239> I<00:02:17.510> can<00:02:17.780> shift<00:02:18.320> my<00:02:18.530> weight<00:02:18.560> to<00:02:19.070> keep

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
shake I can shift my weight to keep

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.970 
shake I can shift my weight to keep
myself<00:02:19.489> going<00:02:20.030> but<00:02:20.989> you<00:02:21.260> know<00:02:21.380> I<00:02:21.440> can't<00:02:21.739> really

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
myself going but you know I can't really

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.630 
myself going but you know I can't really
hold<00:02:22.220> it<00:02:22.489> forever<00:02:23.500> so<00:02:26.800> definitely<00:02:27.800> what<00:02:28.430> I<00:02:28.459> do

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
hold it forever so definitely what I do

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:37.070 
hold it forever so definitely what I do
is<00:02:29.200> take<00:02:30.200> a<00:02:30.470> lot<00:02:30.830> of<00:02:30.980> speed<00:02:31.190> into<00:02:31.520> it<00:02:33.459> so

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.640 

yeah<00:02:37.620> that's<00:02:37.950> my<00:02:38.130> biggest<00:02:38.670> concern<00:02:39.270> is<00:02:40.140> just

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
yeah that's my biggest concern is just

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.960 
yeah that's my biggest concern is just
speed<00:02:41.100> if<00:02:41.580> you<00:02:42.000> can<00:02:42.420> get<00:02:42.600> in<00:02:42.750> to<00:02:43.260> that<00:02:43.290> speed

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
speed if you can get in to that speed

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.970 
speed if you can get in to that speed
and<00:02:44.970> you<00:02:45.240> get<00:02:45.450> in<00:02:45.630> it'll<00:02:46.290> help<00:02:46.440> you<00:02:46.560> go<00:02:46.710> further

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
and you get in it'll help you go further

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.650 
and you get in it'll help you go further
it<00:02:47.370> looks<00:02:47.610> better<00:02:47.850> when<00:02:48.090> you're<00:02:48.210> going<00:02:48.330> fast

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
it looks better when you're going fast

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.120 
it looks better when you're going fast
in<00:02:49.140> my<00:02:49.320> opinion<00:02:49.830> so<00:02:50.310> I<00:02:51.110> had<00:02:52.110> a<00:02:52.140> troubleshooting

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
in my opinion so I had a troubleshooting

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.330 
in my opinion so I had a troubleshooting
I<00:02:53.310> guess<00:02:53.600> things<00:02:54.600> look<00:02:54.870> out<00:02:55.020> for<00:02:55.290> if<00:02:55.920> you<00:02:56.160> get

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
I guess things look out for if you get

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.050 
I guess things look out for if you get
into<00:02:56.670> it

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
into it

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.630 
into it
and<00:02:57.570> you're<00:02:57.720> too<00:02:57.870> far<00:02:58.050> forward<00:02:58.290> it'll<00:02:59.250> catch

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
and you're too far forward it'll catch

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.880 
and you're too far forward it'll catch
and<00:02:59.820> you'll<00:02:59.940> shoot<00:03:00.090> forward<00:03:00.530> maybe<00:03:01.530> you<00:03:01.680> just

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
and you'll shoot forward maybe you just

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.280 
and you'll shoot forward maybe you just
run<00:03:02.100> out<00:03:02.130> of<00:03:02.280> it<00:03:02.610> so<00:03:03.270> you<00:03:03.360> don't<00:03:03.540> die<00:03:03.750> maybe

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
run out of it so you don't die maybe

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.570 
run out of it so you don't die maybe
flip<00:03:04.560> over<00:03:04.970> you're<00:03:05.970> going<00:03:06.390> fast<00:03:06.690> so<00:03:07.580> another

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
flip over you're going fast so another

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.970 
flip over you're going fast so another
one<00:03:08.760> not<00:03:09.570> really<00:03:09.600> that<00:03:10.110> big<00:03:10.350> of<00:03:10.380> a<00:03:10.530> deal

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
one not really that big of a deal

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.790 
one not really that big of a deal
getting<00:03:11.700> it<00:03:11.820> to<00:03:11.970> low<00:03:12.300> and<00:03:12.900> drop<00:03:13.140> down<00:03:13.410> the

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
getting it to low and drop down the

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.710 
getting it to low and drop down the
front<00:03:14.040> Smith<00:03:14.430> I<00:03:16.910> haven't<00:03:17.910> really<00:03:18.120> died<00:03:18.420> on

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
front Smith I haven't really died on

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.890 
front Smith I haven't really died on
that<00:03:18.930> yet<00:03:19.700> one<00:03:20.700> that<00:03:20.940> I<00:03:20.970> was<00:03:21.240> doing<00:03:21.540> when<00:03:21.690> I<00:03:21.750> was

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
that yet one that I was doing when I was

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.930 
that yet one that I was doing when I was
first<00:03:22.050> learning<00:03:22.320> as<00:03:23.010> I<00:03:23.250> was<00:03:23.400> doing<00:03:23.550> it<00:03:23.730> too

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
first learning as I was doing it too

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:24.440 
first learning as I was doing it too
much

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
much

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.060 
much
so<00:03:25.230> I<00:03:25.290> shoot<00:03:25.650> into<00:03:26.100> a<00:03:26.340> nose<00:03:26.790> point<00:03:27.180> and<00:03:28.070> maybe

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
so I shoot into a nose point and maybe

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:30.350 
so I shoot into a nose point and maybe
you<00:03:29.250> got<00:03:29.340> a<00:03:29.400> slide<00:03:30.120> out

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
you got a slide out

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.460 
you got a slide out
you<00:03:30.720> fly<00:03:30.990> backwards

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.370 

that's<00:03:34.160> really<00:03:34.520> the<00:03:34.760> three<00:03:35.690> things<00:03:36.050> that

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
that's really the three things that

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.030 
that's really the three things that
could<00:03:37.130> happen<00:03:37.370> I'm<00:03:38.180> sure<00:03:38.240> there's<00:03:38.690> more<00:03:39.040> but

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
could happen I'm sure there's more but

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.950 
could happen I'm sure there's more but
they<00:03:40.160> haven't<00:03:40.460> happened<00:03:40.760> to<00:03:40.820> me<00:03:40.940> yet<00:03:41.150> so<00:03:41.180> I'll

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:41.960 
they haven't happened to me yet so I'll

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.190 
they haven't happened to me yet so I'll
find<00:03:42.290> out<00:03:43.330> all<00:03:44.330> right<00:03:44.450> I'm<00:03:44.660> gonna<00:03:44.750> show<00:03:45.140> you

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200

find out all right I'm gonna show you
one<00:03:45.500> right<00:03:46.070> now

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.490 

and<00:03:53.780> then<00:03:53.960> you<00:03:54.680> can<00:03:54.890> do<00:03:55.130> front<00:03:56.000> cook<00:03:56.330> front<00:03:57.080> 180

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
and then you can do front cook front 180

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.180 
and then you can do front cook front 180
