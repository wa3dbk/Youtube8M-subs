do<00:05:54.529> it<00:05:54.680> the<00:05:55.490> other<00:05:55.729> part<00:05:56.150> of<00:05:56.389> the<00:05:56.719> browser<00:05:56.930> game

00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:57.199 
do it the other part of the browser game

00:05:57.199 --> 00:05:58.629 
do it the other part of the browser game
is<00:05:57.379> flavor<00:05:57.650> showdown<00:05:58.069> where<00:05:58.250> you<00:05:58.339> can<00:05:58.460> choose

00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 
is flavor showdown where you can choose

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:00.399 
is flavor showdown where you can choose
between<00:05:58.939> two<00:05:59.150> different<00:05:59.300> chips<00:05:59.599> you<00:06:00.080> can<00:06:00.229> pick

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:00.409 
between two different chips you can pick

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:03.010 
between two different chips you can pick
I'd<00:06:00.650> eat<00:06:00.889> that<00:06:00.919> or<00:06:01.339> ID<00:06:01.490> that<00:06:01.819> and<00:06:02.150> that'll<00:06:02.599> give

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
I'd eat that or ID that and that'll give

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.140 
I'd eat that or ID that and that'll give
the<00:06:03.229> rating<00:06:03.889> up<00:06:04.009> on<00:06:04.129> the<00:06:04.219> chips<00:06:04.460> you<00:06:04.789> can<00:06:04.909> also

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:05.150 
the rating up on the chips you can also

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:06.309 
the rating up on the chips you can also
refresh<00:06:05.449> if<00:06:05.629> you<00:06:05.689> don't<00:06:05.839> like<00:06:05.960> either<00:06:06.080> option

00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:06.319 
refresh if you don't like either option

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:08.170 
refresh if you don't like either option
but<00:06:06.800> here<00:06:06.919> we<00:06:07.009> have<00:06:07.039> a<00:06:07.159> really<00:06:07.699> tough<00:06:07.909> choice

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.180 
but here we have a really tough choice

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.040 
but here we have a really tough choice
between<00:06:08.389> the<00:06:09.050> baby<00:06:09.469> Dave<00:06:10.129> M<00:06:10.400> for<00:06:10.939> his<00:06:11.120> musubi

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 
between the baby Dave M for his musubi

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.140 
between the baby Dave M for his musubi
which<00:06:12.469> I'm<00:06:12.650> assuming<00:06:12.770> that<00:06:13.189> is<00:06:13.370> a<00:06:13.789> baby

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.150 
which I'm assuming that is a baby

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.820 
which I'm assuming that is a baby
language<00:06:14.419> for<00:06:14.930> something<00:06:15.439> I'm<00:06:15.589> not

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830 
language for something I'm not

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.200 
language for something I'm not
particularly<00:06:16.099> sure<00:06:16.339> but<00:06:16.550> I<00:06:16.580> always<00:06:16.819> do<00:06:17.060> like<00:06:17.150> a

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
particularly sure but I always do like a

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.510 
particularly sure but I always do like a
surprise<00:06:17.509> and<00:06:17.870> Ashley<00:06:18.560> G<00:06:18.740> with<00:06:18.889> her<00:06:19.069> famous

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 
surprise and Ashley G with her famous

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.050 
surprise and Ashley G with her famous
flavor<00:06:19.759> which<00:06:20.000> is<00:06:20.150> just<00:06:20.389> L<00:06:21.789> we<00:06:22.789> don't<00:06:22.879> know<00:06:23.029> a

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:23.060 
flavor which is just L we don't know a

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.240 
flavor which is just L we don't know a
lot<00:06:23.330> about<00:06:23.449> either<00:06:23.810> of<00:06:23.990> these<00:06:24.139> flavors<00:06:24.620> but<00:06:25.009> i

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.250 
lot about either of these flavors but i

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.670 
lot about either of these flavors but i
think<00:06:25.969> that<00:06:26.089> the<00:06:26.180> baby's<00:06:26.539> judgment<00:06:27.169> is<00:06:27.289> pretty

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:27.680 
think that the baby's judgment is pretty

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.320 
think that the baby's judgment is pretty
good<00:06:27.860> because<00:06:28.039> he<00:06:28.310> actually<00:06:28.520> made<00:06:28.969> an<00:06:29.089> entire

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:29.330 
good because he actually made an entire

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.300 
good because he actually made an entire
word<00:06:29.659> rather<00:06:29.930> than<00:06:30.139> just<00:06:30.289> a<00:06:30.379> letter<00:06:30.589> and<00:06:30.830> i

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:31.310 
word rather than just a letter and i

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.149 
word rather than just a letter and i
like<00:06:31.520> to<00:06:31.639> have<00:06:31.789> more<00:06:32.409> for<00:06:33.409> my<00:06:33.500> money<00:06:33.710> when<00:06:34.039> i'm

so that's doing pretty well paint chips
is<00:07:15.320> still<00:07:15.500> one<00:07:15.800> I<00:07:16.010> thought<00:07:16.250> there'd<00:07:16.400> be<00:07:16.400> a<00:07:16.490> lot

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:16.580 
is still one I thought there'd be a lot

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.160 
is still one I thought there'd be a lot
more<00:07:16.640> popular<00:07:17.120> than<00:07:17.210> it<00:07:17.330> was<00:07:17.450> and<00:07:17.750> butter

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:18.170 
more popular than it was and butter

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:19.950 
more popular than it was and butter
mayonnaise<00:07:18.410> is<00:07:18.680> my<00:07:18.800> champ<00:07:19.100> at<00:07:19.400> three

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:19.960 
mayonnaise is my champ at three

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.730 
mayonnaise is my champ at three
hopefully<00:07:20.960> butter<00:07:21.140> mayonnaise<00:07:21.350> will<00:07:21.590> do

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:21.740 
hopefully butter mayonnaise will do

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.710 
hopefully butter mayonnaise will do
better<00:07:22.100> as<00:07:22.400> the<00:07:22.670> contest<00:07:23.030> progresses<00:07:23.510> and

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:23.720 
better as the contest progresses and

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.420 
better as the contest progresses and
maybe<00:07:24.050> we'll<00:07:24.200> even<00:07:24.320> win<00:07:24.560> so<00:07:25.100> you<00:07:25.190> could<00:07:25.310> go<00:07:25.400> to

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:25.430 
maybe we'll even win so you could go to
