now<00:00:00.210> it's<00:00:00.390> time<00:00:00.539> to<00:00:00.599> look<00:00:00.810> at<00:00:00.900> the<00:00:01.020> second<00:00:01.410> T

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
now it's time to look at the second T

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.940 
now it's time to look at the second T
which<00:00:01.920> is<00:00:01.949> the<00:00:02.220> T<00:00:02.370> foot<00:00:02.610> tone<00:00:02.879> and<00:00:03.859> when<00:00:04.859> we

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
which is the T foot tone and when we

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.039 
which is the T foot tone and when we
look<00:00:05.100> at<00:00:05.220> tone<00:00:05.520> it's<00:00:06.210> mostly<00:00:06.690> about<00:00:06.810> the

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
look at tone it's mostly about the

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.259 
look at tone it's mostly about the
bowing<00:00:07.560> we've<00:00:08.250> looked<00:00:08.519> at<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.790> technical

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
bowing we've looked at the technical

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.140 
bowing we've looked at the technical
issues<00:00:09.389> but<00:00:10.070> the<00:00:11.070> most<00:00:11.370> important<00:00:11.910> issue

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
issues but the most important issue

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.780 
issues but the most important issue
always<00:00:12.630> is<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:12.990> sound<00:00:13.290> issue<00:00:13.650> how<00:00:14.219> it<00:00:14.370> reaches

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
always is the sound issue how it reaches

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.359 
always is the sound issue how it reaches
your<00:00:15.000> ear<00:00:15.179> and<00:00:15.389> what<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.049> tone<00:00:16.350> is<00:00:16.560> like<00:00:16.770> the

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
your ear and what the tone is like the

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.070 
your ear and what the tone is like the
tone<00:00:17.670> creates<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.510> style

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
tone creates a style

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.740 
tone creates a style
it<00:00:19.289> creates<00:00:19.680> emotion<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.609> all<00:00:21.359> these<00:00:21.510> other

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
it creates emotion and all these other

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.840 
it creates emotion and all these other
things<00:00:21.840> that<00:00:22.109> are<00:00:22.470> really<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.699> do<00:00:23.820> with

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
things that are really to do with

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.050 
things that are really to do with
musicality<00:00:24.510> so<00:00:25.369> it's<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.519> very<00:00:26.699> important

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
musicality so it's a very important

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.240 
musicality so it's a very important
thing<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.359> get<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.689> tone<00:00:27.990> in<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.710> bowing

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
thing to get the tone in the bowing

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.040 
thing to get the tone in the bowing
right<00:00:29.730> we've<00:00:30.420> looked<00:00:30.599> at<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.779> bowing

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
right we've looked at the bowing

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.020 
right we've looked at the bowing
patterns<00:00:31.500> we've<00:00:32.099> looked<00:00:32.340> at<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.550> techniques

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
patterns we've looked at the techniques

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.380 
patterns we've looked at the techniques
the<00:00:33.809> legato<00:00:34.230> technique<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.340> accents<00:00:35.850> but

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
the legato technique and the accents but

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.750 
the legato technique and the accents but
now<00:00:36.600> let's<00:00:36.870> try<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.260> find<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.770> sound<00:00:38.250> in<00:00:38.640> the

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
now let's try and find a sound in the

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.459 
now let's try and find a sound in the
bow<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:39.840> fits<00:00:40.680> these<00:00:41.190> accents<00:00:41.760> fits<00:00:42.180> these

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:42.469 
bow that fits these accents fits these

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:43.580 
bow that fits these accents fits these

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
Boeing's

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.360 
Boeing's
to<00:00:44.129> create<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.460> nice<00:00:45.170> mellow<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.440> very<00:00:46.980> swingy

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
to create a nice mellow a very swingy

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.540 
to create a nice mellow a very swingy
swing<00:00:48.149> jazz<00:00:48.450> sound<00:00:48.870> with<00:00:49.770> your<00:00:49.800> violin<00:00:50.340> I

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
swing jazz sound with your violin I

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.540 
swing jazz sound with your violin I
would<00:00:50.850> say<00:00:51.030> hold<00:00:51.300> your<00:00:51.449> violin<00:00:52.550> horizontally

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
would say hold your violin horizontally

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.119 
would say hold your violin horizontally
if<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.120> hold<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.449> down<00:00:54.690> then<00:00:55.500> when<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.800> play

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
if you hold it down then when you play

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.270 
if you hold it down then when you play
your<00:00:56.489> bow<00:00:56.670> will<00:00:56.940> automatically<00:00:57.590> sag<00:00:58.590> because

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
your bow will automatically sag because

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.459 
your bow will automatically sag because
of<00:00:59.460> gravity<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.780> if<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.140> hold<00:01:01.320> it

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
of gravity so if you hold it

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.160 
of gravity so if you hold it
horizontally<00:01:01.910> then<00:01:02.910> you'll<00:01:03.090> have<00:01:03.270> an<00:01:03.480> ideal

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
horizontally then you'll have an ideal

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.370 
horizontally then you'll have an ideal
basis<00:01:04.739> for<00:01:05.299> bowing<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.630> play<00:01:06.869> wherever<00:01:07.140> you

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
basis for bowing to play wherever you

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.810 
basis for bowing to play wherever you
want<00:01:07.590> without<00:01:08.540> forces<00:01:09.560> trying<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.770> make<00:01:11.520> your

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
want without forces trying to make your

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.920 
want without forces trying to make your
day<00:01:12.450> very<00:01:12.810> miserable<00:01:13.400> so<00:01:14.400> horizontal<00:01:15.240> violin

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
day very miserable so horizontal violin

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.609 
day very miserable so horizontal violin
and<00:01:16.200> as<00:01:16.920> for<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.220> bow<00:01:17.430> try<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.330> hold<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.840> in<00:01:19.470> a

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
and as for the bow try to hold it in a

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.810 
and as for the bow try to hold it in a
relaxed<00:01:20.100> way<00:01:20.450> with<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.570> wrist<00:01:21.840> that's<00:01:22.820> more

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
relaxed way with the wrist that's more

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.570 
relaxed way with the wrist that's more
or<00:01:24.000> less<00:01:24.150> not<00:01:24.840> exactly<00:01:25.229> straight<00:01:25.590> but<00:01:26.040> not<00:01:26.340> at

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
or less not exactly straight but not at

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.760 
or less not exactly straight but not at
a<00:01:26.610> great<00:01:26.850> angle<00:01:27.299> because<00:01:27.869> if<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.080> do<00:01:28.200> this<00:01:28.380> you

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
a great angle because if you do this you

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.770 
a great angle because if you do this you
block<00:01:29.130> all<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.850> nerves<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:30.420> block<00:01:30.600> all

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
block all the nerves and you block all

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.080 
block all the nerves and you block all
the<00:01:30.900> energy<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:32.009> feeling<00:01:32.460> that<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:32.939> have

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
the energy and the feeling that you have

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.850 
the energy and the feeling that you have
in<00:01:33.299> your<00:01:33.420> hand<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:33.810> in<00:01:33.900> your<00:01:34.020> fingers<00:01:34.380> the

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
in your hand and in your fingers the

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.710 
in your hand and in your fingers the
fingers<00:01:34.890> basically<00:01:35.640> should<00:01:35.820> be<00:01:35.970> not<00:01:36.509> too

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
fingers basically should be not too

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.069 
fingers basically should be not too
loose<00:01:36.930> but<00:01:37.560> flexible<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.930> they're<00:01:39.930> like

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
loose but flexible and they're like

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.800 
loose but flexible and they're like
shock<00:01:40.530> breakers<00:01:41.060> if<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:42.210> could<00:01:42.390> say<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.689> that

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
shock breakers if I could say it that

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.440 
shock breakers if I could say it that
way<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.680> wrist<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:44.189> flexible<00:01:45.060> as<00:01:45.210> well

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
way and the wrist is flexible as well

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.560 
way and the wrist is flexible as well
and<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:47.130> stuff<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.670> makes<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.000> bow<00:01:48.299> go

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
and the the stuff that makes the bow go

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.740 
and the the stuff that makes the bow go
and<00:01:48.840> your<00:01:49.560> arm<00:01:49.770> go<00:01:50.009> is<00:01:50.329> happening<00:01:51.329> probably

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
and your arm go is happening probably

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.999 
and your arm go is happening probably
here<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:54.020> wrist<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.619> fingers<00:01:55.979> are

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
here and the wrist and the fingers are

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.100 
here and the wrist and the fingers are
just<00:01:56.219> helping<00:01:56.790> this<00:01:56.939> movement<00:01:57.390> they're<00:01:57.930> not

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
just helping this movement they're not

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.499 
just helping this movement they're not
too<00:01:58.320> active<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.950> so<00:01:59.909> we<00:02:00.060> don't<00:02:00.210> want<00:02:00.420> the

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
too active and so we don't want the

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.359 
too active and so we don't want the
wrist<00:02:00.689> at<00:02:00.990> an<00:02:01.200> angle<00:02:01.469> like<00:02:01.590> this<00:02:01.619> or<00:02:01.950> at<00:02:02.219> an

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
wrist at an angle like this or at an

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.230 
wrist at an angle like this or at an
angle<00:02:02.700> like<00:02:02.729> that

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
angle like that
