00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.929
 How are youtube friends here? 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.000
 I have been bringing a new video of how 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:29.090

 serve and enjoy much of this video and 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:38.500
 that the good thing about this game is that 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:40.660
 they need emulator 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.080
 The first thing to do is tell us 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.080
 the link that go into them and when 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.520
 we have it only we give in download 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.559
 second step since we have the file 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.480
 we are going to give right click and extract 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.879
 here with windows rom our 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.800
 decompressed files and we will 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.320
 leave a folder if they do not have the winrar 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.449
 led I leave a link below in the 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.100

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:12.360

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.310
 we will give double click 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.980

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:30.580
 next next next we go here to click on the 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.920
 second option and also here because we 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.560
 an icon of the game is going to appear 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.490

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.490

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.460
 as you see, it will appear here 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.440
 and now we just have to go here 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.640
 where is the control and we are going to give 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.409

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.860

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.090
 ah 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.630
 to remove it we just have to give it 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:27.010
