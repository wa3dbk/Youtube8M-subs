00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
good idea what I might do for the

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.200 
good idea what I might do for the
injectors<00:01:57.440> is<00:01:57.650> the<00:01:57.770> same<00:01:58.010> thing<00:01:58.280> I<00:01:58.930> have<00:02:00.970> as<00:02:01.970> I

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
injectors is the same thing I have as I

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.750 
injectors is the same thing I have as I
am<00:02:02.330> going<00:02:02.570> to<00:02:02.630> boost<00:02:02.840> this<00:02:03.050> I<00:02:03.260> have<00:02:03.500> to<00:02:03.760> it's

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
am going to boost this I have to it's

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:10.119 
am going to boost this I have to it's
only<00:02:04.910> right<00:02:06.010> but<00:02:07.929> for<00:02:08.929> the<00:02:09.129> injectors

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:10.129 
only right but for the injectors

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:11.619 
only right but for the injectors
probably<00:02:10.609> do<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:10.819> same<00:02:11.000> thing<00:02:11.239> keep<00:02:11.480> these

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:11.629 
probably do the same thing keep these

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:18.039 
probably do the same thing keep these
clips<00:02:11.989> up<00:02:12.140> here<00:02:12.409> and<00:02:15.250> cut<00:02:16.250> this<00:02:16.400> out<00:02:16.640> put<00:02:17.480> other
