00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:08.470
 and 

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:11.800
 summer moves away and autumn is approaching 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:15.280
 and with it we also change the tones in 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:18.610
 the makeup and also on the clothes in 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.560
 this time I was inspired by the color 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.480
 gray and the pink that we make the 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.230
 perfect combination then we started 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:29.230
 with my eyebrows I always try to fix 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.960
 my eyebrows with the pencil is what most 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:36.000
 like and always used a base in this 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:38.370
 Occasion is a gloss number 45 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.110
 try my loves always blur 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:46.470
 very well the pre base so that it does not 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:48.510
 XC60 customers accumulate stigma 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:52.980
 use already the shadow fox and naked 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:55.590
 2 and this everything I will not use it in all the 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.320
 eyebrow bone of these one tone page 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.970
 mate that looks very nice in this 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.440
 I'm going to use this combination 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:07.050
 gray shade of the anayet two with the 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.960
 same brush on the entire mobile eyelid 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:13.460
 complete from the tear to the 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.460
 final part of the eye 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.240
 i 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.920
 next I will use a brush of 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:28.570
 this is the 35 signatures and I'm going to use 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:30.490
 the mental shadow of the naked 1 in all 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.829
 the eye sockets 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.140
 always try my love in the basin 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:37.990
 of the eye blur the tones very well 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:41.110
 Take your time in this step which is what 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:44.759
 essential to give a beautiful finish and 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.759
 well polished to the shadows 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.799
 now with the 36th of sitma which is a 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:02.280
 precision brush I will use the 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.729
 shade violin also from the lakers 1 a 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.729
 lighting mode in the area of 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.729
 tear 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.990
 never forget this step because it gives a lot 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.540
 light and brightness to any makeup 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:23.400
 now with the story shadow a brush 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:26.280
 short I'm going to highlight a bit the line of 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.590
 side to the lower lashes for that 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.400
 area I will also use a pencil in 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.380
 nude tones not white so the line 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.890
 of the water have eye candy but do not look 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.890
 very white 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.769
 now if we get to the eyeliner and I'm going to 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:46.080
 use my favorite that is the fart 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.940
 beautiful inside and I will be a 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.700
 fine delineated but a little 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.480
 ascending to go up a little bit more 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.480
 the look 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.970
 in the same way I will use a 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.670
 eye mask that gives me a little bit of 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.100
 volume but that does not leave my eyelashes 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:10.670
 too dense because in the same way 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:14.260
 I will use these false eyelashes 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.260

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.870

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:28.050
