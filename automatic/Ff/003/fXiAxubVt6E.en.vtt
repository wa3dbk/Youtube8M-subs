00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.880 
physics basically the ball is no longer
tethered<00:02:33.210> to<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.570> player<00:02:33.780> in<00:02:33.810> possession<00:02:34.110> so

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
tethered to the player in possession so

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.380 
tethered to the player in possession so
it<00:02:34.980> bounces<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:35.550> ricochets<00:02:35.970> much<00:02:36.210> more

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
it bounces and ricochets much more

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.540 
it bounces and ricochets much more
realistically<00:02:36.900> as<00:02:37.110> you<00:02:37.200> pass<00:02:37.410> it<00:02:37.560> around

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.490 

this<00:02:42.150> has<00:02:42.300> completely<00:02:42.720> changed<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:43.230> way<00:02:43.350> the

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
this has completely changed the way the

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.260 
this has completely changed the way the
FIFA<00:02:43.800> plays<00:02:44.070> and<00:02:44.370> it<00:02:44.700> takes<00:02:44.910> some<00:02:45.060> getting

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
FIFA plays and it takes some getting

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.540 
FIFA plays and it takes some getting
used<00:02:45.450> to<00:02:45.510> it<00:02:45.690> first<00:02:45.900> no<00:02:46.740> longer<00:02:47.130> can<00:02:47.280> a<00:02:47.340> player

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
used to it first no longer can a player

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.430 
used to it first no longer can a player
streak<00:02:48.000> up<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.240> field<00:02:48.480> crashing<00:02:49.230> through<00:02:49.350> the

streak up the field crashing through the

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.140 
streak up the field crashing through the
defense<00:02:49.800> to<00:02:49.980> make<00:02:50.100> a<00:02:50.130> few<00:02:50.370> quick<00:02:50.550> passes<00:02:50.970> and

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
defense to make a few quick passes and

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.150 
defense to make a few quick passes and
then<00:02:51.420> take<00:02:51.570> a<00:02:51.600> shot<00:02:51.870> at<00:02:51.960> the<00:02:52.050> net<00:02:52.260> now<00:02:52.890> that<00:02:53.070> the

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
then take a shot at the net now that the

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.100 
then take a shot at the net now that the
ball<00:02:53.340> is<00:02:53.370> its<00:02:53.580> own<00:02:53.700> entity<00:02:53.970> steals<00:02:54.750> are<00:02:54.930> much

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
ball is its own entity steals are much

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:01.709 
ball is its own entity steals are much
more<00:02:55.290> likely<00:02:55.530> when<00:02:55.830> two<00:02:55.980> players<00:02:56.280> collide

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:01.719 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:03.640 

that's<00:03:02.719> where<00:03:02.959> the<00:03:03.019> right<00:03:03.200> analog<00:03:03.500> stick

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
that's where the right analog stick

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.440 
that's where the right analog stick
comes<00:03:04.099> with<00:03:04.280> while<00:03:04.909> moving<00:03:05.180> down<00:03:05.299> the<00:03:05.420> field

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
pushing the right stick in any direction

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.220 
pushing the right stick in any direction
causes<00:03:07.969> the<00:03:08.060> player<00:03:08.269> to<00:03:08.540> lead<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:08.900> ball<00:03:09.049> that

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
causes the player to lead the ball that

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.559 
causes the player to lead the ball that
way<00:03:09.409> and<00:03:09.709> then<00:03:09.829> give<00:03:10.040> chase<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:11.090> end<00:03:11.239> result

way and then give chase the end result

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.660 
way and then give chase the end result
is<00:03:11.689> a<00:03:11.719> much<00:03:11.930> slower<00:03:12.260> but<00:03:12.769> more<00:03:12.829> realistic<00:03:13.310> game

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
is a much slower but more realistic game

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.280 
is a much slower but more realistic game
