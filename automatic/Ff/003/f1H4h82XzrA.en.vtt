tonight so no I think because it's an

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.000

artist<00:00:15.929> interpretation<00:00:16.529> like<00:00:16.619> if<00:00:16.740> I<00:00:16.859> were<00:00:16.980> to

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
artist interpretation like if I were to

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.460

do<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.699> Salvador<00:00:18.270> Dali<00:00:18.300> piece<00:00:18.600> on<00:00:18.810> you<00:00:18.960> it<00:00:19.350> would

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
do a Salvador Dali piece on you it would

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.500 
do a Salvador Dali piece on you it would
be<00:00:19.560> my<00:00:19.680> interpretation<00:00:19.890> of<00:00:20.460> it<00:00:20.609> so<00:00:21.090> it's<00:00:21.359> not

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
be my interpretation of it so it's not

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.630 
be my interpretation of it so it's not
like<00:00:21.810> I<00:00:21.990> would<00:00:22.140> be<00:00:22.170> mass<00:00:22.920> producing<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.550> and

a tough part um you know I think the

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:54.890

physical part of quitting drinking
wasn't<00:04:55.350> difficult

wasn't difficult

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.030 
wasn't difficult
I<00:04:55.889> just<00:04:56.040> think<00:04:56.190> adapting<00:04:57.180> to<00:04:57.919> seeing<00:04:58.919> the

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
I just think adapting to seeing the

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.280 
I just think adapting to seeing the
world<00:04:59.130> through<00:04:59.370> sober<00:04:59.729> eyes<00:04:59.880> was<00:05:00.690> a<00:05:00.720> was<00:05:01.260> a

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 
world through sober eyes was a was a

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.080 
world through sober eyes was a was a
wake-up<00:05:01.590> call<00:05:01.650> you<00:05:02.040> know<00:05:02.130> I<00:05:02.160> mean<00:05:02.400> you<00:05:02.880> really

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
wake-up call you know I mean you really

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.240 
wake-up call you know I mean you really
start<00:05:03.570> seeing<00:05:03.870> who<00:05:04.470> your<00:05:04.620> real<00:05:04.800> friends<00:05:04.950> are

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
start seeing who your real friends are

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.610 
start seeing who your real friends are
when<00:05:05.669> you<00:05:06.389> give<00:05:06.570> up<00:05:06.750> a<00:05:06.870> lifestyle<00:05:07.290> like<00:05:07.440> that

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
when you give up a lifestyle like that

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.129 
when you give up a lifestyle like that
and<00:05:07.889> my<00:05:08.729> friend<00:05:09.389> my<00:05:09.540> phone<00:05:09.690> stopped<00:05:10.050> ringing

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139 
and my friend my phone stopped ringing

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:12.440 
and my friend my phone stopped ringing
for<00:05:10.620> a<00:05:10.650> long<00:05:10.830> time<00:05:11.070> and<00:05:11.340> I<00:05:11.610> think<00:05:12.210> it's<00:05:12.360> a

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
for a long time and I think it's a

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:13.490 
for a long time and I think it's a
blessing<00:05:12.870> you<00:05:12.900> know<00:05:13.020> it's<00:05:13.169> almost<00:05:13.290> like<00:05:13.410> a

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.490 
blessing you know it's almost like a

filtered filtering out people that you
know<00:05:16.800> sure<00:05:17.250> but<00:05:17.669> it's<00:05:17.820> also<00:05:17.940> like<00:05:18.900> you<00:05:19.320> have<00:05:19.410> a
