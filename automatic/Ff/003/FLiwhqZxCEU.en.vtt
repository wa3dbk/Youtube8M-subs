00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.130
 why 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.080
 and happy 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.060
 by the result of the team after 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.800
 obviously I do not work for him 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.910
 and improve day by day within the field of 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.790
 game but 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.290
 the important thing here in the group beyond 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.989
 of the individual and is ready for 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.620
 so that the whole group has the 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.620
 winning mentality 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.219
 The truth is that it is a very difficult team 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.140
 a team of hierarchy but good 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:06.729
 we focused on what we have 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.830
 that make our way of our 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.740
 identity of games what they ask for the 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.350
 We have to be a master 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.820
 calm and know that the qualities and 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.210
 we have the conditions to beat him 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.210
 to anyone 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.920
 or 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.900
 [Music] 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.520
 we want to be able to give the fans a gift 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.070
 positive result because because good 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.600
 the truth that people stayed to sleep 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.780
 in the stadium to be able to get his 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.610
 ticket so I hope to morning 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.000
 the team gives him back in the field 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.000
 game 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.760
 [Music] 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.590
 the truth that a virus that I do not even know 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.440
 where it came out that had me out of the 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.290
 courts for eight months 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.630
 but the reality is that it was a 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.010
 complicated moment because because the 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:10.050
 health is paramount so I was 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.610
 I was off the field outside of everything 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.160
 at that time I did not care what 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.440
 only I wanted was to be fine 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.010
 of health physically and everything so 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.930
 well with time after that 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:27.540
 back and we can play again 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.150

 I had the luck to be in 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.120
 Cagliari on the island of Sardinia in Italy 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:20.459
 which is a beautiful city 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.220

 which of the three experiences that touched me 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:32.440
 leaving argentina it seems to me that 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:38.800
 Veracruz moment is the most position
