00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
even looked in my direction it's kind of

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:29.029 
even looked in my direction it's kind of
weird<00:00:28.800> though

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
weird though

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.890 
weird though
I<00:00:29.220> mean<00:00:29.669> clearly<00:00:30.119> you're<00:00:30.330> invisible<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.749> the

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
I mean clearly you're invisible to the

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.540 
I mean clearly you're invisible to the
Gerudo<00:00:31.289> z--<00:00:31.320> but<00:00:31.589> I<00:00:31.769> can<00:00:32.040> see<00:00:32.220> you<00:00:32.310> just<00:00:32.490> fine

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
Gerudo z-- but I can see you just fine

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.730 
Gerudo z-- but I can see you just fine
hmm<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:33.540> don't<00:00:33.750> know<00:00:33.840> maybe<00:00:34.410> it's<00:00:34.620> because

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:34.740 
hmm I don't know maybe it's because

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.770 
hmm I don't know maybe it's because
you're<00:00:35.070> in<00:00:35.160> such<00:00:35.310> close<00:00:35.550> proximity<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:36.210> me<00:00:36.390> or

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
you're in such close proximity to me or

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.390 
you're in such close proximity to me or
maybe<00:00:37.079> its<00:00:37.290> effect<00:00:37.530> doesn't<00:00:37.770> work<00:00:37.860> on<00:00:38.010> fairies

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:38.400 
maybe its effect doesn't work on fairies

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.060 
maybe its effect doesn't work on fairies
for<00:00:38.550> some<00:00:38.699> reason<00:00:39.030> huh<00:00:39.510> weird<00:00:40.079> but<00:00:40.710> as<00:00:40.860> long<00:00:41.039> as

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
for some reason huh weird but as long as

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.350 
for some reason huh weird but as long as
it<00:00:41.219> works<00:00:41.309> on<00:00:41.550> them<00:00:41.699> I<00:00:41.730> guess<00:00:42.000> it's<00:00:42.149> all<00:00:42.210> that

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
it works on them I guess it's all that

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.970 
it works on them I guess it's all that
matters<00:00:42.390> now<00:00:43.199> I<00:00:43.230> just<00:00:43.320> have<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.559> wait<00:00:43.739> for<00:00:43.890> them

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980
