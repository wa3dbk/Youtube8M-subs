straight so if we were to land an ace or

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.149 
straight so if we were to land an ace or
a<00:01:39.060> king<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.689> wouldn't<00:01:40.320> pull<00:01:40.530> us<00:01:40.650> ahead<00:01:41.009> of

a king that wouldn't pull us ahead of

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.490 
a king that wouldn't pull us ahead of
him<00:01:41.400> although<00:01:42.210> if<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.479> jack<00:01:42.780> hits<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.259> board

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
him although if the jack hits the board

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.310 
him although if the jack hits the board
that<00:01:43.770> will<00:01:43.920> give<00:01:44.159> us<00:01:44.430> 10<00:01:44.850> Jack<00:01:45.329> Queen<00:01:45.689> King<00:01:45.720> ace

that will give us 10 Jack Queen King ace

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.800 
that will give us 10 Jack Queen King ace
our<00:01:47.189> straight<00:01:47.700> would<00:01:47.850> be<00:01:48.000> greater<00:01:48.270> than<00:01:48.479> his
