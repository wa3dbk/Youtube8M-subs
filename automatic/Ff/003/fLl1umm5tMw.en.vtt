should<00:02:21.660> hold<00:02:21.840> it<00:02:21.960> in<00:02:22.050> place<00:02:22.230> I<00:02:25.670> might<00:02:26.670> just<00:02:26.880> put

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
should hold it in place I might just put

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.790 
should hold it in place I might just put
my<00:02:27.180> pins<00:02:27.570> a<00:02:30.170> little<00:02:31.170> bit<00:02:31.290> closer<00:02:31.560> together

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
my pins a little bit closer together

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:38.180 
my pins a little bit closer together
there<00:02:34.730> okay<00:02:36.650> going<00:02:37.650> to<00:02:37.740> put<00:02:37.860> my<00:02:37.980> needle

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
there okay going to put my needle

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:46.550 
there okay going to put my needle
through<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.790> hole<00:02:43.459> and<00:02:44.750> getting<00:02:45.750> started<00:02:46.110> can

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
through the hole and getting started can

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:54.020 
through the hole and getting started can
be<00:02:46.770> a<00:02:47.930> little<00:02:48.930> bit<00:02:49.080> awkward<00:02:52.370> if<00:02:53.370> I've<00:02:53.580> used<00:02:53.610> my

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
be a little bit awkward if I've used my

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.580 
be a little bit awkward if I've used my
thumb<00:02:54.330> and<00:02:54.510> my<00:02:54.570> finger<00:02:54.630> just<00:02:54.930> to<00:02:55.230> hold<00:02:55.440> the

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
thumb and my finger just to hold the

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:03.350 
thumb and my finger just to hold the
button<00:02:55.830> in<00:02:55.890> place<00:03:00.800> I'm<00:03:01.800> going<00:03:02.040> to<00:03:02.160> aim<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:03.239> put

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
button in place I'm going to aim to put

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.780 
button in place I'm going to aim to put
my<00:03:03.480> needle<00:03:03.660> through<00:03:04.010> and<00:03:05.010> get<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.430> thread<00:03:05.670> to

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
my needle through and get the thread to

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.300 
my needle through and get the thread to
come<00:03:05.940> out<00:03:06.060> on<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:06.300> other<00:03:06.330> side<00:03:06.750> of<00:03:07.310> those

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
come out on the other side of those

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.610 
come out on the other side of those
needles<00:03:08.790> have<00:03:09.690> those<00:03:09.900> pins<00:03:10.200> at<00:03:10.380> the<00:03:10.410> back

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
needles have those pins at the back

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:20.300 
needles have those pins at the back
there<00:03:11.570> okay<00:03:16.519> and<00:03:18.709> you<00:03:19.709> just<00:03:19.769> have<00:03:19.980> to<00:03:20.070> go<00:03:20.160> by

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
there okay and you just have to go by

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.240 
there okay and you just have to go by
field<00:03:20.610> to<00:03:20.760> get<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:20.940> needle<00:03:21.680> back<00:03:22.680> through<00:03:22.709> the

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
field to get the needle back through the

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:29.000 
field to get the needle back through the
original<00:03:23.730> hole<00:03:27.110> so<00:03:28.110> I<00:03:28.140> repeat<00:03:28.530> these<00:03:28.680> probably

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
original hole so I repeat these probably

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.530 
original hole so I repeat these probably
about<00:03:30.709> five<00:03:31.709> to<00:03:31.980> six<00:03:32.130> times<00:03:32.430> on<00:03:32.940> either<00:03:33.150> side

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
about five to six times on either side

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.910 
about five to six times on either side
now<00:03:35.120> if<00:03:36.120> you<00:03:36.239> want<00:03:36.420> when<00:03:36.570> you're<00:03:36.720> creating<00:03:37.650> the

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
now if you want when you're creating the

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.400 
now if you want when you're creating the
shank<00:03:38.160> I've<00:03:39.030> seen<00:03:39.299> some<00:03:39.570> people<00:03:39.690> hold<00:03:40.290> a

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
shank I've seen some people hold a

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.060 
shank I've seen some people hold a
toothpick<00:03:40.890> on<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:42.030> top<00:03:42.239> of<00:03:42.360> the<00:03:42.420> button<00:03:43.070> you

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
toothpick on the top of the button you

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.720 
toothpick on the top of the button you
could<00:03:44.190> try<00:03:44.430> that<00:03:44.640> and<00:03:44.910> I<00:03:46.220> find<00:03:47.220> it<00:03:47.370> a<00:03:47.549> bit

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
could try that and I find it a bit

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.820 
could try that and I find it a bit
awkward<00:03:48.239> so<00:03:48.269> turn<00:03:49.260> this<00:03:49.380> way<00:03:49.560> a<00:03:49.590> little<00:03:49.709> bit

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
awkward so turn this way a little bit

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.250 
awkward so turn this way a little bit
easier<00:03:50.190> for<00:03:50.250> me<00:03:50.519> if<00:03:51.299> you<00:03:51.570> wanted<00:03:51.810> to<00:03:51.930> create<00:03:52.200> a

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
easier for me if you wanted to create a

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.949 
easier for me if you wanted to create a
bigger<00:03:52.440> shank<00:03:52.799> I<00:03:53.100> mean<00:03:53.790> to<00:03:53.880> put<00:03:54.090> some<00:03:54.840> extra

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
bigger shank I mean to put some extra

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.350 
bigger shank I mean to put some extra
pins<00:03:55.380> in<00:03:56.120> see<00:03:57.120> if<00:03:57.239> that<00:03:57.390> works<00:03:57.570> for<00:03:57.780> you

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
pins in see if that works for you

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:05.690 
pins in see if that works for you
okay<00:04:02.840> once<00:04:03.840> I've<00:04:04.019> done<00:04:04.170> that<00:04:04.370> five<00:04:05.370> or<00:04:05.519> six

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
okay once I've done that five or six

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.460 
okay once I've done that five or six
times<00:04:06.000> going<00:04:06.510> to<00:04:06.600> go<00:04:06.780> over<00:04:06.930> to<00:04:07.019> the<00:04:07.110> other<00:04:07.260> side

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
times going to go over to the other side

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:17.090 
times going to go over to the other side
now<00:04:10.910> making<00:04:11.910> sure<00:04:13.280> I'll<00:04:14.280> get<00:04:14.489> my<00:04:14.610> thread<00:04:16.100> on

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
now making sure I'll get my thread on

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.610 
now making sure I'll get my thread on
the<00:04:17.220> other<00:04:17.340> side<00:04:17.609> of<00:04:17.760> the<00:04:17.850> pins<00:04:18.090> there

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:30.100

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
okay now I can remove those pins and

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.540 
okay now I can remove those pins and
next<00:04:38.340> thing<00:04:38.430> I'm<00:04:38.550> going<00:04:38.669> to<00:04:38.730> do<00:04:38.940> is<00:04:39.270> just<00:04:39.600> bring

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
next thing I'm going to do is just bring

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.670 
next thing I'm going to do is just bring
my<00:04:41.550> thread<00:04:41.850> back<00:04:41.880> through<00:04:42.450> the<00:04:42.630> fabric<00:04:42.840> and

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
my thread back through the fabric and

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.860 
my thread back through the fabric and
try<00:04:43.950> and<00:04:44.100> bring<00:04:44.250> the<00:04:44.370> needle<00:04:44.669> out<00:04:44.790> in<00:04:45.300> between

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
try and bring the needle out in between

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:51.320 
try and bring the needle out in between
the<00:04:46.770> fabric<00:04:47.250> and<00:04:47.460> the<00:04:47.730> button<00:04:49.970> we're<00:04:50.970> going<00:04:51.180> to

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
the fabric and the button we're going to

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.110 
the fabric and the button we're going to
wind<00:04:51.950> my<00:04:52.950> thread<00:04:53.250> around<00:04:53.370> the<00:04:53.610> button<00:04:53.880> maybe

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
wind my thread around the button maybe

00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:02.260 
wind my thread around the button maybe
four<00:04:54.480> times<00:04:56.900> do<00:04:57.900> one<00:04:58.139> more<00:04:58.290> for<00:04:58.410> good<00:04:58.560> luck<00:04:58.590> and

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.170 

then<00:05:03.270> we're<00:05:03.360> going<00:05:03.510> to<00:05:04.490> push<00:05:05.490> my<00:05:05.700> needle<00:05:05.880> back

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
then we're going to push my needle back

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:17.600 
then we're going to push my needle back
through<00:05:07.880> to<00:05:08.880> the<00:05:08.970> back<00:05:09.150> of<00:05:09.330> the<00:05:09.389> fabric

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.700 

okay<00:05:18.479> then<00:05:18.810> we're<00:05:18.900> gonna<00:05:18.990> hook<00:05:19.139> my<00:05:19.319> thread

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
okay then we're gonna hook my thread

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.909 
okay then we're gonna hook my thread
under<00:05:20.870> one<00:05:21.870> of<00:05:21.990> the<00:05:22.080> other<00:05:22.110> stitches<00:05:22.530> there

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
under one of the other stitches there

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:27.020 
under one of the other stitches there
that<00:05:23.069> I've<00:05:23.159> already<00:05:23.430> done<00:05:24.800> and<00:05:25.800> then<00:05:26.669> the<00:05:26.789> next

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
that I've already done and then the next

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.580 
that I've already done and then the next
couple<00:05:27.180> of<00:05:27.360> times<00:05:29.569> before<00:05:30.569> I<00:05:30.810> pull<00:05:31.080> it<00:05:31.169> all<00:05:31.319> the

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
couple of times before I pull it all the

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.580 
couple of times before I pull it all the
way<00:05:31.710> through<00:05:32.900> see<00:05:33.900> that<00:05:34.080> you've<00:05:34.199> got<00:05:34.229> a<00:05:34.379> bit<00:05:34.560> of

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
way through see that you've got a bit of

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.830 
way through see that you've got a bit of
a<00:05:34.710> loop<00:05:34.979> there<00:05:35.280> at<00:05:35.430> the<00:05:35.550> end<00:05:35.729> kind<00:05:36.479> of<00:05:36.599> put<00:05:36.750> my

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
a loop there at the end kind of put my

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.580 
a loop there at the end kind of put my
needle<00:05:37.050> through<00:05:37.199> the<00:05:37.409> loop<00:05:38.719> and<00:05:39.719> just<00:05:39.750> pull<00:05:40.289> it

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
needle through the loop and just pull it

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.999 
needle through the loop and just pull it
gently<00:05:40.819> and<00:05:41.990> that'll<00:05:42.990> really<00:05:43.169> help<00:05:43.409> to<00:05:43.620> secure
