00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:40.359 
rapidly it sounds like this get the idea

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:41.580 
rapidly it sounds like this get the idea
okay

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
okay

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
strengths three and four with our picks

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.569 
strengths three and four with our picks
and<00:01:44.200> then<00:01:44.349> we're<00:01:44.500> gonna<00:01:44.590> strike<00:01:44.920> string<00:01:45.310> five

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:45.579 
and then we're gonna strike string five

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:48.719 
and then we're gonna strike string five
with<00:01:45.789> our<00:01:45.909> thumb<00:01:46.770> just<00:01:47.770> slide<00:01:48.099> down<00:01:48.369> and<00:01:48.640> then

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429 
strike three and four and then five with

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:58.619 
strike three and four and then five with
the<00:01:54.610> a<00:01:54.640> pedal<00:01:56.219> raise<00:01:57.219> the<00:01:57.610> a<00:01:57.640> belt<00:01:58.119> and<00:01:58.450> then

the a pedal raise the a belt and then
slide<00:01:59.049> the<00:01:59.259> string<00:01:59.500> up

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.680 

that<00:02:08.500> was<00:02:08.649> an<00:02:08.800> easy<00:02:08.950> one<00:02:09.190> but<00:02:09.640> rapidly<00:02:10.119> take

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
that was an easy one but rapidly take

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:17.010 
that was an easy one but rapidly take
some<00:02:10.899> coordination<00:02:15.450> get<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.570> idea

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
some coordination get the idea

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.380 
some coordination get the idea
okay<00:02:17.740> real<00:02:18.100> good<00:02:18.340> now<00:02:18.610> here's<00:02:18.850> the<00:02:18.940> dominant

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
okay real good now here's the dominant

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:27.950 
okay real good now here's the dominant
seventh<00:02:19.720> type<00:02:19.870> banjo<00:02:20.350> roll<00:02:20.550> sounds<00:02:21.550> like<00:02:21.670> this

no<00:02:28.960> this<00:02:29.380> is<00:02:29.530> a<00:02:29.560> very<00:02:29.890> very<00:02:30.070> effective<00:02:30.400> run

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
no this is a very very effective run

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.940 
no this is a very very effective run
some<00:02:31.000> of<00:02:31.090> your<00:02:31.210> faster<00:02:31.600> on<00:02:31.810> single<00:02:32.590> note<00:02:32.740> lines

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
some of your faster on single note lines

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:43.500 
some of your faster on single note lines
so<00:02:33.640> what<00:02:33.850> we're<00:02:33.970> actually<00:02:34.150> playing<00:02:34.600> is<00:02:42.510> we
