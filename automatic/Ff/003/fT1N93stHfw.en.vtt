00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
do it to where they were at that point

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.380 
do it to where they were at that point
in<00:01:21.890> their<00:01:22.039> career<00:01:22.399> at<00:01:22.580> one<00:01:22.789> point<00:01:23.030> in<00:01:23.240> their

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
in their career at one point in their

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.359 
in their career at one point in their
