 there will be a player named white 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.540
 I'm sure there are a lot of famous people with 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.220
 such a last name but when i collected in 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.010
 line-up I remembered Walter White 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.729
 the runaway series and so on the left 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.890
 worth white 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.659
 central attacking midfielder is it 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.430
 We namesake keanu reeves and order 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.640
 himself who played in the matrix and was 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.100
 cute but this is not kyan this is our b andreev 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.840
 on the right midfield is another player who 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.509
 standing out of position so tons of lego 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.579
 on the protection of the new stand on our right this 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.380
 freeman namesake famous actor 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.570
 morgana freeman i'm sure you all him 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.820
 you know from the film 1408 shoshenka 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.450
 but in a bunch of movies he played the same 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.850
 batman 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.130
 Well, the attack is another namesake 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.530
 famous actor namesake Denzel 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.110
 washington but another player we have in 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.850
 the team is not exactly the namesake because 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.640
 what if i'm sure have a completely different last name 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.649
 This Madison Well here is such a composition of us 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.960
 it turns out let's try to play for 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.509
 we play him in the cup and is with us 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.909
 the next opponent is rating 81 award and 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.119
 oldridge attack 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.280
 against our team before we feel 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:07.039
 hit on nothing will fight 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.890
 the ball drove less next to ours 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.870
 the gate rival runs on the flank here 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.200
 protection protection takes away no takes away from 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.769
 TPA saved pass shooting all endure 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.420
 got out 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:20.569
 well now let's overclock ours 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.510
 players so washington with maddison ball 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.950
 on top of dreams go on but on top of him 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.040
 The defender is much faster than our player 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.349
 this throw can go blow hit we 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.010
 we score a goal in the 10th minute 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:35.930
 just pretty guys the whole team well done yes 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.819
 as long as I really like this team and 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.230
 we knock our heads off but now I thought 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.730
 it will be easier to play although there is no our 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.410
 opponent and angry right now but 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.799
 he tried to run right through 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.310
 Centre 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:48.410
 let's answer him for that bare groove by 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.920
 ACT saved that passes another goal and 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:54.290
 I'm her goalkeeper here put the goalkeeper but he with 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.379
 ball pass in the morning if someone is who it is 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.810
 reeves it was keanu reeves but almost 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:00.349
 keanu reeves and remote varrot reef with 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.870
 ball 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.340
 we all closed at sun rice just 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.670
 runs well and it is necessary to hammer reeves 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.000
 rifter you score again next 3 st 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.340
 beats 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.560
 next to the gate cast already on our 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.200
 gate earlier with the ball as we stand 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.459
 the goalkeeper I do n't even know the goalkeeper we have there 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.260
 generally participated in it 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.720
 moment the ball hit the crossbar of you attacks 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.760
 rival continues winds it 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.849
 all who are there perfectly takes the ball from us 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.380
 maybe another attack no can't 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.989
 my son lose the ball on he fights him 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.630
 madison yes my son fights for the ball and 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:36.919
 drove to disperse the players so drove 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:38.989
 overclock no pass we run we take away 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:42.380
 we run a run and down cast 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:44.840
 white white score white oh well 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.239
 already 3 simple moments were the players beat 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.910
 past the gate could at least at least 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.769
 One goal to score and I do not understand what it is 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.870
 maybe handicap but rival in general 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.519
 can't hit on this gate once 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.560
 he hit the crossbar attack on 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:00.230
 defenders generally take away very easily 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.030
 Look at all and the opponent is already without a sword 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.150
 ninety one percent pass us off 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.069
 rival 85 not bad such a team to have 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.390
 ninety one percent 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.519
 gears without teamwork without everything 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.810
 the opponent decided to play the head and 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:11.939
 a rampage we are likely 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.400
 break through 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:17.350
 no strange rival did 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.269
 the opponent in the center opens his player 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.609
 passes it just passes and protects 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.590
 worth the defense is standing still let's 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.050
 choose let's choose not give him 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.220
 pass he plays back just makes 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:33.900
 the ball hits him 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:36.389
 let's not let pass on weight 11 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:40.090
 Still, the opponent clears from the overhang 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:44.860
 Washington pass excellent yet 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:46.900
 not passed though although although the goal is 121 to 45 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.419
 minutes something all his players blunted 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.010
 and the goalkeeper somehow jumped incomprehensibly but 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:53.110
 see the player he came 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:57.220
 the goalkeeper just lay down before the ball rival 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:05:00.130
 Immediately runs our gate yes no well 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.530
 against no such command no no no 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.479
 let's put up an opponent something 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.639
 generally despaired against such a team 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:09.760
 flee center field ends us 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:11.680
 first half and stats by ownership 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.360
 a sword and of course we lose but the rest 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.160
 we have more beats we have 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.200
 more shots on target and goals 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.960
 Respectively more he runs for Remi 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:22.060
 subtract the ball on frame Velez saved but 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.320
 principle as considered all saves from a 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.290
 first can now organize 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.410
 counterattack though ben no what did ben i 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:30.940
 something not understood rival center runs 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.130
 a series of unsuccessful rolls he gives 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.440
 will instruct my wife starish left foot 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:37.240
 strikes and the goalkeeper is of course powerless 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.820
 excellent center right now you can give 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:43.780
 center and you can score eat why from him 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:45.550
 the ball bounced sterling you sterling her 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.740
 now it seems to me just run all 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.229
 yes yes yes so he does he just everyone 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.770
 runs out goes to the gate makes posts 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:56.440
 our opponent just scores a goal 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:59.020
 ran a sterling mom on the flank gave 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:01.870
 transfer and and closed passes passes 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.910
 transmission pass which again is not accurate 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:06.190
 transfer how many moments we have created 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.900
 if the transfer of her cloak were here but 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:11.919
 Now here is exactly a chance well and 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:14.380
 transfer I just don't know what to do 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:16.280
 maybe I should not give the transfer 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:20.150
 beat in these moments 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:29.540
 and cast our gates and frame now to us 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:31.460
 will score the last goal already to 42 and we 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.590
 losing 42 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:36.080
 where were the moments we could we score 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:38.690
 we had such a tight attack at the end 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.759
 On all the same, we missed Rome and he did not 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.710
 requested and here is such a statistic in 

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:46.569
 principle equal but all thanks to all 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.569
 attention with you was 3 all bye
