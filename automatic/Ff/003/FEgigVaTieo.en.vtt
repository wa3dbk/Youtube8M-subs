00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.269
 greetings guardians welcome again 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:12.570
 to the weekly house assault this week 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:17.260
 we have the sink to be in venus the 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.850
 axor of the priest kar conte and how to 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.940
 giving the caprichito we have gotten into 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:24.460
 the three elemental damages he 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:27.070
 the arc damage the sun damage and the damage 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.230
 of emptiness as you know this is an assault 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.710
 which is relatively easy does not have 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.829
 a lot of complication are not defined 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.870
 as others have it 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.640
 and the day moving forward we have the part 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.010
 where is this kind of mountain are 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.469
 the enemies below give us a little bit of 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.659
 Every man can do two things or 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.089
 start to eliminate them or wait for them 

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:49.739
 kill each other and so you are more 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:52.229
 calm and go for example in this 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.760
 How are we going with cristÃ³bal and me? 

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:56.140
 we hope that some damage is done and 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.720
 then finish the job 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.550
 once this part has passed, you will have to 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.950
 the barracudas and pull forward 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.120
 this part I think is a bit delicate 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.540
 because there is a lot 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:10.240
 gosling and they can bitch you a little bit 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.950
 with his sniper shots like that 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.240
 that a little patience with a good 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.340
 weapon I in this case we carry the 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.720
 icebreaker that I think for these 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.369
 cases is better because of the issue of 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.530
 ammunition and how we have three years 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.330
 well you can also use the lpr 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.000
 which is very good with your shot 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.409
 penetrating as good doing the 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.930
 black hammer also another very option 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.970
 good good we keep moving forward 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.560
 the zones of the cider this way has 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.190
 a lot of complication and once 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.170
 we get to the part of axesor you can 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.660
 refugees in the hallway where you enter 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.070
 what is in the esplanade I think that in 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.200
 the easiest part we go we what 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.030
 we do so it's very well you cover yourself 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.190
 and be able to relive you calmly if you 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.039
 they kill from that part and well once 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.780
 that the priest knew you can plant him 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:55.539
 face with what if you take the young yo 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.100
 I think that between three he knocks us down in ten in 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:59.200
 ten seconds you take it in this case not 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.180
 as we were you and I have only had the 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.760
 winner because we had to work not what 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.910
 a little more 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:10.030
 but we did not have the always call and 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:13.480
 hated reward in equal parts and if 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:16.540
 you look at the end when when you kill 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.480
 the priest talks about the place of the next 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:23.100
 dlc which is supposed to substitute 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.100
 the root of the presidio of the elders 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.870
 in the prison of the elderly 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.910
 the vision is at the forefront that the 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.100
 priest is back with which no 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.190
 strange that we find many surprises 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:40.430
 even at the same I do not know if the same axor 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.530
 we will tell it or not it is not known so 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.090
 well he taught us the reward that we have 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.510
 had the two assaults the truth that 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.670
 well not with respect to the weapon I do not 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.010
 I can complain and the piece of armor 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.440
 you also do not know another week I'm still 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.520
 have the moon hawk but good what 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.830
 we will give you may not have 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.240
 still so the lakers share if 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.890
 you liked the video and as always 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.890
 see you at the border
