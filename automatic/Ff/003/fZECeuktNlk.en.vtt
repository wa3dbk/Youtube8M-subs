00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
because yesterday we're struggling a bit

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.080 
because yesterday we're struggling a bit
with<00:02:02.770> that<00:02:02.890> you<00:02:03.280> know<00:02:03.370> give<00:02:03.640> slower<00:02:03.880> and

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
with that you know give slower and

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.420 
with that you know give slower and
slower<00:02:04.210> as<00:02:04.420> the<00:02:04.450> run<00:02:04.659> goes<00:02:04.690> on<00:02:05.280> so<00:02:06.280> we're

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
slower as the run goes on so we're

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.460

pretty<00:02:06.580> happy<00:02:06.760> and<00:02:07.030> I<00:02:07.090> think<00:02:07.300> that<00:02:07.479> of<00:02:08.200> course

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:11.469 
stepping-stone and we need to obviously

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:12.880
