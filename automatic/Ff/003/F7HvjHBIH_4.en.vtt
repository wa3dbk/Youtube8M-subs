performance<00:00:43.500> wise<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.980> it's<00:00:44.250> very<00:00:44.340> very<00:00:45.059> solid

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
performance wise is it's very very solid

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.470 
performance wise is it's very very solid
however<00:00:46.260> that's<00:00:47.100> only<00:00:47.399> if<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:47.850> do<00:00:48.239> some

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
however that's only if you do some

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.810 
however that's only if you do some
really<00:00:48.780> crazy<00:00:49.079> things<00:00:49.469> like<00:00:49.590> see<00:00:50.489> this<00:00:50.579> track

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
really crazy things like see this track

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.240 
really crazy things like see this track
pad<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.510> seems<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.199> hate<00:00:52.440> me<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:52.980> maybe<00:00:53.100> he

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
pad it seems to hate me so maybe he

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.069 
pad it seems to hate me so maybe he
works<00:00:53.460> different<00:00:53.760> for<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.510> really<00:00:54.809> works

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
works different for you it really works

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.720 
works different for you it really works
very<00:00:55.350> well<00:00:55.469> if<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.770> use<00:00:55.920> something<00:00:56.250> called<00:00:56.399> an

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
very well if you use something called an

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.270 
very well if you use something called an
external<00:00:57.210> mouse<00:00:57.360> when<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.050> was<00:00:58.260> deciding<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:59.160> do

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
external mouse when I was deciding to do

external mouse when I was deciding to do
something<00:00:59.609> called<00:00:59.789> scrolling<00:01:00.780> with<00:01:01.170> two

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
something called scrolling with two

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.770 
something called scrolling with two
fingers<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:02.129> decided<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:02.910> was<00:01:03.300> pinching<00:01:03.629> and

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
fingers it decided I was pinching and

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.840 
fingers it decided I was pinching and
zooming<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:04.260> don't<00:01:04.710> agree<00:01:04.860> with<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:05.100> so<00:01:05.430> that

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
zooming I don't agree with that so that

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.609 
zooming I don't agree with that so that
didn't<00:01:06.030> work<00:01:06.119> out<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:06.330> well<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:07.290> build

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
didn't work out so well the build

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.030 
didn't work out so well the build
quality<00:01:07.890> on<00:01:08.400> this<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:09.320> pretty<00:01:10.320> chintzy<00:01:10.710> I'm

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
quality on this is pretty chintzy I'm

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.910 
quality on this is pretty chintzy I'm
really<00:01:11.310> surprised<00:01:11.700> at<00:01:11.909> how<00:01:12.110> how<00:01:13.110> poor<00:01:13.560> this

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
really surprised at how how poor this

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.100 
really surprised at how how poor this
thing<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.280> put<00:01:14.460> together<00:01:14.580> if<00:01:14.939> i<00:01:15.540> push<00:01:15.810> on<00:01:15.990> the

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
thing is put together if i push on the

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.679 
thing is put together if i push on the
keys<00:01:16.380> just<00:01:17.280> like<00:01:17.400> in<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.549> other<00:01:17.689> ultrabook

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689

actual flex under the tray of the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.160 
actual flex under the tray of the
keyboard<00:01:23.520> it's<00:01:23.970> really<00:01:24.420> unsettling<00:01:25.049> because

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
keyboard it's really unsettling because

interesting design element I don't know
this<00:01:31.290> is<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.470> bug<00:01:31.680> or<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.890> feature<00:01:31.970> when<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.000> was

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
this is a bug or a feature when I was

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.730 
this is a bug or a feature when I was
picking<00:01:33.299> up<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.659> notebook<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.170> put<00:01:34.290> in<00:01:34.380> my<00:01:34.470> bag

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
picking up the notebook to put in my bag

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.219 
picking up the notebook to put in my bag
I<00:01:35.070> heard<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.759> noise<00:01:38.360> the<00:01:39.360> bottom<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:39.990> case

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
I heard a noise the bottom of the case

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.440 
I heard a noise the bottom of the case
here<00:01:40.680> apparently<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.340> not<00:01:41.400> exactly<00:01:42.090> attached

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
here apparently is not exactly attached

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.380 
here apparently is not exactly attached
to<00:01:42.990> something<00:01:43.350> inside<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.399> notebook<00:01:44.909> so<00:01:45.270> it

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
to something inside the notebook so it

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.359 
to something inside the notebook so it
makes<00:01:45.570> this<00:01:45.750> clicking<00:01:46.079> noise<00:01:46.500> which<00:01:47.009> freaks

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
makes this clicking noise which freaks

makes this clicking noise which freaks
me<00:01:47.520> out<00:01:47.549> because<00:01:47.790> this<00:01:48.420> thing<00:01:48.630> costs<00:01:48.930> eight

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
me out because this thing costs eight

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.780 
me out because this thing costs eight
hundred<00:01:49.500> dollars<00:01:49.530> when<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.280> starts<00:01:50.610> at<00:01:50.700> eight

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
hundred dollars when it starts at eight

it it's kind of a pain one more thing
about<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.909> design<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.479> this<00:01:57.600> bothered<00:01:57.960> me

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
about the design and this bothered me

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.280 
about the design and this bothered me
because<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.670> predecessor<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.240> 410<00:02:00.840> that

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290
