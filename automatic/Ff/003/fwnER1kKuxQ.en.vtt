this<00:02:10.000> van<00:02:10.239> that<00:02:10.450> D

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.589 

so<00:02:15.739> it's<00:02:15.980> a<00:02:16.040> little<00:02:16.220> bit<00:02:16.400> of<00:02:16.520> a<00:02:16.879> little<00:02:17.360> bit<00:02:17.480> of

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
so it's a little bit of a little bit of

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.240 
so it's a little bit of a little bit of
fingerstyle<00:02:18.080> we're<00:02:18.349> getting<00:02:18.560> into<00:02:18.769> into<00:02:19.010> the

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
fingerstyle we're getting into into the

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.070 
fingerstyle we're getting into into the
movement<00:02:19.489> there<00:02:19.910> all<00:02:20.390> right<00:02:20.510> so<00:02:20.720> here's<00:02:20.930> the

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
movement there all right so here's the

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.339 
movement there all right so here's the
lick<00:02:21.230> I<00:02:21.349> start<00:02:21.590> with<00:02:21.709> the<00:02:21.800> a<00:02:21.830> and<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.280> D<00:02:23.349> I'm

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
lick I start with the a and the D I'm

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:25.479 
lick I start with the a and the D I'm
going<00:02:24.440> to<00:02:24.590> go<00:02:24.650> from<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:24.920> D<00:02:25.129> which<00:02:25.310> is<00:02:25.340> the

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
going to go from the D which is the

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.470 
going to go from the D which is the
fourth<00:02:25.879> up<00:02:26.269> to<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.260> flatted<00:02:27.680> fifth<00:02:27.920> with<00:02:28.190> the

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
fourth up to the flatted fifth with the

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.150 
fourth up to the flatted fifth with the
e-flat<00:02:29.480> with<00:02:29.720> my<00:02:29.840> pinky<00:02:30.260> do<00:02:30.709> a<00:02:30.739> little<00:02:30.920> hammer

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
e-flat with my pinky do a little hammer

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.309 
e-flat with my pinky do a little hammer
on<00:02:31.280> a<00:02:31.400> pull<00:02:31.640> off<00:02:31.790> there

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:41.530 

I<00:02:36.120> resolve<00:02:37.120> that<00:02:37.239> down<00:02:37.450> to<00:02:37.599> the<00:02:37.719> sea

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.869 

then<00:02:42.200> I<00:02:42.319> usually<00:02:42.500> go<00:02:42.769> back<00:02:42.950> to<00:02:43.159> the<00:02:43.250> Diggy<00:02:43.519> the

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 
then I usually go back to the Diggy the

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:47.930 
then I usually go back to the Diggy the
D<00:02:44.090> again

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.820 

all<00:02:48.940> this<00:02:49.240> is<00:02:49.450> one<00:02:49.690> pull<00:02:50.050> off<00:02:50.260> and<00:02:50.500> hammer-on

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
all this is one pull off and hammer-on

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:58.410 
all this is one pull off and hammer-on
move<00:02:51.069> I<00:02:53.340> just<00:02:54.340> add<00:02:54.670> this<00:02:54.819> a<00:02:54.970> to<00:02:55.030> it

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.080 

and<00:02:58.930> I<00:02:58.990> react<00:02:59.290> you<00:02:59.620> late<00:02:59.770> that<00:02:59.950> D<00:03:00.190> there<00:03:00.490> so<00:03:00.970> the

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
and I react you late that D there so the

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.390 
and I react you late that D there so the
three<00:03:01.360> moves<00:03:01.630> are

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
three moves are

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.080 
three moves are
you

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.330 

and<00:03:06.380> then<00:03:07.380> you<00:03:07.500> can<00:03:07.650> spin<00:03:07.950> out<00:03:07.980> about<00:03:08.280> a

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
and then you can spin out about a

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.449 
and then you can spin out about a
variety<00:03:08.550> of<00:03:08.880> different<00:03:09.239> ways

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.690 

and<00:03:12.939> go<00:03:13.090> back<00:03:13.269> to<00:03:13.390> that<00:03:13.480> see<00:03:13.780> and<00:03:14.019> then<00:03:14.109> just

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
and go back to that see and then just

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.360 
and go back to that see and then just
something<00:03:15.700> like<00:03:15.819> that

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.560 

well<00:03:20.370> maybe<00:03:20.520> I<00:03:20.640> can<00:03:20.820> resolve<00:03:21.150> it<00:03:21.330> from<00:03:21.480> the

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
well maybe I can resolve it from the

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.180 
well maybe I can resolve it from the
seat<00:03:21.780> of<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:21.930> C<00:03:22.110> sharp<00:03:22.410> with<00:03:22.680> that<00:03:22.800> second

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
seat of the C sharp with that second

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:34.640 
seat of the C sharp with that second
finger<00:03:32.180> there<00:03:33.180> I<00:03:33.210> did<00:03:33.450> it<00:03:33.480> two<00:03:34.230> different<00:03:34.380> ways

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
finger there I did it two different ways

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.410 
finger there I did it two different ways
there

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
there

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.370 
there
I<00:03:38.209> do<00:03:39.209> that<00:03:39.420> real<00:03:39.630> slowly

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:04:05.890 

I<00:03:54.490> do<00:03:55.490> another<00:03:55.760> case<00:04:03.970> so<00:04:04.970> that's<00:04:05.180> really<00:04:05.660> the

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
I do another case so that's really the

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.990 
I do another case so that's really the
first<00:04:06.140> look<00:04:06.470> that<00:04:06.500> we're<00:04:06.770> talking<00:04:06.950> about<00:04:07.280> now

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
first look that we're talking about now

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.960 
first look that we're talking about now
I<00:04:08.030> can<00:04:08.480> do<00:04:08.600> it<00:04:08.630> in<00:04:09.340> various<00:04:10.340> positions<00:04:10.640> if<00:04:10.910> I

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
I can do it in various positions if I

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.240 
I can do it in various positions if I
was<00:04:11.120> in<00:04:11.180> the<00:04:11.270> key<00:04:11.390> of<00:04:11.420> G<00:04:11.840> I<00:04:12.050> would<00:04:12.860> do<00:04:13.040> down<00:04:13.220> here

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
was in the key of G I would do down here

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:20.080 
was in the key of G I would do down here
in<00:04:13.520> the<00:04:13.610> third<00:04:13.850> position<00:04:18.760> something<00:04:19.760> about

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
in the third position something about

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.690 
in the third position something about
that<00:04:20.270> high<00:04:20.600> note<00:04:20.660> of<00:04:21.140> the<00:04:21.470> G<00:04:21.500> and<00:04:21.950> this<00:04:22.460> other

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
that high note of the G and this other

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.700 
that high note of the G and this other
the<00:04:23.390> lower<00:04:23.630> notes<00:04:23.960> that<00:04:24.200> are<00:04:24.290> being<00:04:24.440> hammer

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
the lower notes that are being hammer

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.260 
the lower notes that are being hammer
around<00:04:24.830> and<00:04:25.070> pulled<00:04:25.250> off<00:04:25.430> it's<00:04:25.850> very<00:04:26.060> similar

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
around and pulled off it's very similar

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.480 
around and pulled off it's very similar
to<00:04:26.390> a<00:04:26.510> piano<00:04:26.780> piano<00:04:27.560> blues<00:04:27.950> lick<00:04:28.220> you'll<00:04:28.370> hear

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
to a piano piano blues lick you'll hear

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:29.350 
to a piano piano blues lick you'll hear
this<00:04:28.640> all<00:04:28.850> the<00:04:28.880> time

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
this all the time

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.780 
this all the time
they'll<00:04:29.660> keep<00:04:29.840> one<00:04:30.110> note<00:04:30.320> steady<00:04:31.220> and<00:04:31.490> the

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:31.790 
they'll keep one note steady and the

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.390 
they'll keep one note steady and the
other<00:04:31.940> notes<00:04:32.180> will<00:04:32.330> move<00:04:32.510> around<00:04:33.010> alright<00:04:34.010> now

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
other notes will move around alright now

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.870 
other notes will move around alright now
here's<00:04:34.820> a<00:04:34.910> different<00:04:35.000> lick<00:04:35.750> that<00:04:35.930> involves

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
here's a different lick that involves

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.310 
here's a different lick that involves
bending<00:04:37.880> and<00:04:38.030> sliding<00:04:38.570> some<00:04:38.750> of<00:04:38.840> these<00:04:38.930> double

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
bending and sliding some of these double

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.080 
bending and sliding some of these double
stops<00:04:39.560> around<00:04:39.980> we're<00:04:40.910> going<00:04:41.000> to<00:04:41.090> go<00:04:41.150> back<00:04:41.300> to<00:04:41.330> a

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
stops around we're going to go back to a

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.580 
stops around we're going to go back to a
I'm<00:04:44.090> going<00:04:44.210> to<00:04:44.300> come<00:04:44.390> up<00:04:44.510> here<00:04:44.540> to<00:04:44.780> this<00:04:44.870> D<00:04:45.260> and

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
I'm going to come up here to this D and

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.090 
I'm going to come up here to this D and
the<00:04:45.950> F<00:04:46.100> sharp<00:04:47.260> and<00:04:48.260> I'm<00:04:48.380> going<00:04:48.500> to<00:04:48.560> bend<00:04:48.740> both

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
the F sharp and I'm going to bend both

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.550 
the F sharp and I'm going to bend both
of<00:04:49.340> these<00:04:49.430> notes<00:04:49.760> a<00:04:50.000> little<00:04:50.420> bit<00:04:50.690> up<00:04:50.840> and<00:04:50.960> back

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
of these notes a little bit up and back

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:57.320 
of these notes a little bit up and back
down

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.189 

so<00:04:58.330> if<00:04:58.419> you<00:04:58.509> think<00:04:58.629> about<00:04:58.750> it<00:04:58.990> I'm<00:04:59.050> actually

00:04:59.189 --> 00:04:59.199 
so if you think about it I'm actually

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:06.839 
so if you think about it I'm actually
just<00:04:59.379> going<00:04:59.560> a<00:04:59.680> half<00:04:59.800> step<00:05:00.009> up

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:06.849 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:09.010 

and<00:05:07.849> you<00:05:07.970> can<00:05:08.090> resolve<00:05:08.360> it<00:05:08.509> back<00:05:08.659> down<00:05:08.810> to<00:05:08.930> the

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
and you can resolve it back down to the
