in the middle

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.419 
in the middle
we<00:00:11.910> unbuckle<00:00:12.570> that<00:00:12.780> and<00:00:13.769> plugs<00:00:14.040> all<00:00:14.280> the

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
we unbuckle that and plugs all the

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.450 
we unbuckle that and plugs all the
injectors<00:00:14.879> at<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.179> same<00:00:15.419> time<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:16.320> then<00:00:17.250> you

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
injectors at the same time and then you

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.700 
injectors at the same time and then you
take<00:00:17.820> off<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.180> fuel<00:00:18.420> lines<00:00:18.690> front<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.200> back<00:00:19.350> I

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
take off the fuel lines front and back I

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.060 
take off the fuel lines front and back I
set<00:00:19.950> it<00:00:20.070> up<00:00:20.160> there<00:00:21.440> but<00:00:22.440> basically<00:00:22.800> once

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
set it up there but basically once

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.990 
set it up there but basically once
that's<00:00:23.310> all<00:00:23.520> pulled<00:00:25.250> wiggle<00:00:26.250> your<00:00:26.400> intake<00:00:26.790> up

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
that's all pulled wiggle your intake up

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.740 
that's all pulled wiggle your intake up
and<00:00:27.210> out<00:00:28.430> unsnag<00:00:29.430> it<00:00:32.149> that's<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:33.450> when<00:00:33.600> it's

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
and out unsnag it that's it when it's

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.439 
and out unsnag it that's it when it's
out<00:00:33.980> and<00:00:34.980> that's<00:00:35.160> your<00:00:35.339> Spyder<00:00:35.640> injector<00:00:36.239> look

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:36.449 
out and that's your Spyder injector look

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:38.389 
out and that's your Spyder injector look
at<00:00:36.570> these<00:00:36.660> four<00:00:37.109> legs<00:00:37.350> on<00:00:37.620> this<00:00:37.800> side<00:00:38.070> four

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
at these four legs on this side four

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.549 
at these four legs on this side four
legs<00:00:38.609> on<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.000> back<00:00:39.149> they<00:00:40.079> got<00:00:40.230> these<00:00:40.410> little

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
legs on the back they got these little

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.000 
legs on the back they got these little
buckle<00:00:41.460> things<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:41.879> plug<00:00:42.210> them<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.449> there

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
buckle things that plug them in there

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.160 
buckle things that plug them in there
doing<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.160> intake<00:00:44.760> manifold<00:00:45.359> gasket<00:00:45.839> on<00:00:45.960> this

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
doing the intake manifold gasket on this

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.639 
doing the intake manifold gasket on this
I<00:00:46.320> thought<00:00:46.499> I<00:00:46.530> had<00:00:46.859> to<00:00:47.010> take<00:00:47.249> off<00:00:47.839> the<00:00:48.839> upper<00:00:49.260> to

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
I thought I had to take off the upper to

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.729 
I thought I had to take off the upper to
get<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.949> the<00:00:50.070> lower<00:00:51.170> this<00:00:52.170> because<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:52.499> is<00:00:52.559> my

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
get to the lower this because this is my

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.799 
get to the lower this because this is my
first<00:00:53.399> rodeo<00:00:53.670> with<00:00:53.999> these<00:00:54.390> ones<00:00:54.629> but

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
first rodeo with these ones but

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.569 
first rodeo with these ones but
apparently<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.499> can<00:00:55.710> pull<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.069> all<00:00:56.219> as<00:00:56.399> one

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
apparently you can pull it all as one

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.680 
apparently you can pull it all as one
piece<00:00:57.079> that's<00:00:58.079> what<00:00:58.260> I'd<00:00:58.350> recommend<00:00:58.559> doing

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
piece that's what I'd recommend doing

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.149 
piece that's what I'd recommend doing
but<00:01:00.690> anyway<00:01:01.109> this<00:01:01.229> one<00:01:01.409> had<00:01:01.530> leaks<00:01:01.769> everywhere

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:02.159 
but anyway this one had leaks everywhere

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:05.320 
but anyway this one had leaks everywhere
so<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:02.519> had<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.729> pull<00:01:02.909> it<00:01:02.999> all<00:01:03.120> apart<00:01:03.149> anyway<00:01:04.159> so

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
so I had to pull it all apart anyway so

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.010 
so I had to pull it all apart anyway so
blah<00:01:06.330> blah<00:01:06.630> blah<00:01:06.930> that's<00:01:07.320> what's<00:01:07.620> up

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.859

bunch<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.390> other<00:01:21.479> ones<00:01:21.690> gotta<00:01:22.350> have<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.560> special

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
bunch of other ones gotta have a special

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.100 
bunch of other ones gotta have a special
wrench<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:24.119> be<00:01:24.240> able<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.509> get<00:01:24.600> underneath<00:01:24.900> the

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
wrench to be able to get underneath the

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.660 
wrench to be able to get underneath the
distributor<00:01:25.590> because<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.890> hangs<00:01:26.100> over<00:01:26.520> it

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
distributor because it hangs over it

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.660 
distributor because it hangs over it
this<00:01:27.479> is<00:01:27.659> what<00:01:27.840> it<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:28.200> i<00:01:28.470> guess<00:01:29.340> you'd<00:01:29.640> call

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
this is what it is i guess you'd call

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.760 
this is what it is i guess you'd call
that<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:30.030> wrench<00:01:30.330> it<00:01:30.630> classifies<00:01:31.259> it's<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.560> box

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
that a wrench it classifies it's a box

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.310 
that a wrench it classifies it's a box
in<00:01:31.979> rich<00:01:32.190> it's<00:01:32.460> bad<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:33.659> anyway<00:01:34.080> you<00:01:34.170> reach

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
in rich it's bad so anyway you reach

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.320 
in rich it's bad so anyway you reach
underneath<00:01:34.649> of<00:01:34.890> there<00:01:35.100> before<00:01:35.640> pulling<00:01:36.149> a

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
underneath of there before pulling a

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.560 
underneath of there before pulling a
distributor<00:01:36.930> it's<00:01:37.770> good<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.340> mark<00:01:39.119> where<00:01:39.420> it

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
distributor it's good to mark where it

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.230 
distributor it's good to mark where it
lines<00:01:39.869> up<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:41.130> see<00:01:41.340> on<00:01:41.490> this<00:01:41.640> one<00:01:41.880> i've<00:01:42.030> got<00:01:42.210> a

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
lines up you see on this one i've got a

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.660 
lines up you see on this one i've got a
red<00:01:42.479> mark<00:01:42.509> on<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.229> cap<00:01:43.679> and<00:01:43.979> on<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.220> base

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
red mark on the cap and on the base

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.940 
red mark on the cap and on the base
they'll<00:01:45.179> help<00:01:45.509> ensure<00:01:46.410> that<00:01:46.440> I<00:01:46.560> get<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.860> in<00:01:46.920> the

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
they'll help ensure that I get it in the

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.380 
they'll help ensure that I get it in the
right<00:01:47.100> place<00:01:47.340> they<00:01:47.820> also<00:01:48.210> twist<00:01:49.250> so<00:01:50.390> you'll

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
right place they also twist so you'll

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.600 
right place they also twist so you'll
also<00:01:51.600> want<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:52.050> mark<00:01:52.289> the<00:01:52.500> base<00:01:52.710> where<00:01:53.460> the

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
also want to mark the base where the

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.400 
also want to mark the base where the
base<00:01:53.789> is<00:01:53.820> for<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.539> twist<00:01:54.810> because<00:01:54.929> the<00:01:55.140> twist

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.410 
base is for the twist because the twist

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.469 
base is for the twist because the twist
will<00:01:55.560> affect<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.130> rest<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.820> where<00:01:57.330> it

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
will affect the rest of it where it

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.290 
will affect the rest of it where it
lines<00:01:57.690> up<00:01:57.929> so<00:01:58.830> anyway<00:01:59.310> it's<00:01:59.910> just<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.179> little

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
lines up so anyway it's just a little

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.290 
lines up so anyway it's just a little
detail<00:02:00.690> I<00:02:00.720> hope<00:02:01.020> that's<00:02:01.229> helpful<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.830> you<00:02:02.300> okay

so<00:02:03.360> here's<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.810> lower<00:02:04.140> intake<00:02:04.590> manifold

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
so here's the lower intake manifold

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.590 
so here's the lower intake manifold
there's<00:02:05.369> only<00:02:05.520> four<00:02:05.820> bolts<00:02:06.149> that<00:02:06.210> hold<00:02:06.390> this

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
there's only four bolts that hold this

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.740 
there's only four bolts that hold this
sucker<00:02:06.869> down<00:02:07.140> it's<00:02:07.860> right<00:02:08.130> here<00:02:08.429> here<00:02:08.819> here<00:02:09.600> in

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
sucker down it's right here here here in

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.509 
sucker down it's right here here here in
here<00:02:09.989> this<00:02:10.200> one<00:02:10.350> slotted<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:10.979> help<00:02:11.160> you<00:02:11.280> slide

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
here this one slotted to help you slide

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.720 
here this one slotted to help you slide
it<00:02:11.700> out<00:02:11.850> you've<00:02:12.780> got<00:02:13.010> not<00:02:14.010> four<00:02:14.250> bolts<00:02:14.549> eight

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
it out you've got not four bolts eight

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.520 
it out you've got not four bolts eight
there's<00:02:15.030> four<00:02:15.239> on<00:02:15.269> each<00:02:15.480> end<00:02:15.720> I<00:02:15.959> don't<00:02:16.440> know

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
there's four on each end I don't know

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.880 
there's four on each end I don't know
what<00:02:16.680> I'm<00:02:16.799> talking<00:02:16.980> about<00:02:18.049> but<00:02:19.049> basically<00:02:19.200> the

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
what I'm talking about but basically the

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.190 
what I'm talking about but basically the
reason<00:02:20.190> why<00:02:20.430> replacing<00:02:21.390> this<00:02:21.540> is<00:02:21.750> that<00:02:21.959> this

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
reason why replacing this is that this

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.690 
reason why replacing this is that this
runs<00:02:22.470> coolant<00:02:22.890> through<00:02:23.040> it<00:02:23.220> and<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.489> run

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
runs coolant through it and you run

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.300 
runs coolant through it and you run
links<00:02:24.180> on<00:02:24.510> either<00:02:24.959> end<00:02:25.290> it<00:02:25.739> was<00:02:25.860> leaking<00:02:26.190> on

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
links on either end it was leaking on

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.340 
links on either end it was leaking on
this<00:02:26.519> and<00:02:26.820> it<00:02:27.030> was<00:02:27.120> also<00:02:27.299> leaking<00:02:27.750> on<00:02:27.900> this<00:02:28.079> and

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
this and it was also leaking on this and

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.380 
this and it was also leaking on this and
usually<00:02:28.980> if<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.370> see<00:02:29.549> it<00:02:29.640> like<00:02:29.820> that<00:02:29.850> it's<00:02:30.239> a

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
usually if you see it like that it's a

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.090 
usually if you see it like that it's a
warping<00:02:30.900> issue<00:02:31.110> where<00:02:31.470> it's<00:02:31.620> overheated<00:02:33.049> I

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
warping issue where it's overheated I

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.160 
warping issue where it's overheated I
usually<00:02:35.269> tell<00:02:36.269> you<00:02:36.360> what<00:02:36.510> I<00:02:36.540> use<00:02:36.750> a<00:02:36.780> lot<00:02:37.049> of

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
usually tell you what I use a lot of

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.750 
usually tell you what I use a lot of
silicone<00:02:37.500> when<00:02:37.860> I<00:02:37.950> put<00:02:38.130> these<00:02:38.250> back<00:02:38.489> down

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
silicone when I put these back down

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.789 
silicone when I put these back down
because<00:02:39.090> if<00:02:39.209> it<00:02:39.329> is<00:02:39.450> warped<00:02:39.959> you're<00:02:40.560> just

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
because if it is warped you're just

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.710 
because if it is warped you're just
gonna<00:02:40.950> leak<00:02:41.250> again<00:02:41.549> in<00:02:41.760> short<00:02:41.790> order<00:02:42.269> if<00:02:42.600> you

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
gonna leak again in short order if you

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.289 
gonna leak again in short order if you
don't<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.860> stuff<00:02:44.340> I<00:02:44.459> like<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.880> use<00:02:45.030> is

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
don't the stuff I like to use is

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.509 
don't the stuff I like to use is
Permatex<00:02:45.900> right<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:46.320> stuff<00:02:46.500> and<00:02:47.070> get<00:02:47.250> a<00:02:47.280> shot

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
Permatex right and stuff and get a shot

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.720 
Permatex right and stuff and get a shot
of<00:02:47.730> that<00:02:47.760> for<00:02:48.180> you<00:02:48.829> it<00:02:49.829> needs<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:50.190> go<00:02:50.340> for<00:02:50.700> a

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
of that for you it needs to go for a

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.569 
of that for you it needs to go for a
lickin<00:02:51.390> right<00:02:51.660> look<00:02:51.930> at<00:02:52.079> this<00:02:52.440> did<00:02:53.250> I<00:02:53.370> make

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
see that there's a breeze coming out of

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.530 
see that there's a breeze coming out of
the<00:03:04.769> backside<00:03:05.220> ones<00:03:05.489> that<00:03:05.760> one<00:03:05.940> was<00:03:06.120> leaking

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
the backside ones that one was leaking

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.420 
the backside ones that one was leaking
and<00:03:06.690> also<00:03:07.049> was<00:03:07.170> leaking<00:03:07.500> out<00:03:07.620> of<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:07.739> front<00:03:07.920> I

and also was leaking out of the front I
use<00:03:09.299> a<00:03:09.329> Mac<00:03:10.220> universal<00:03:11.220> pressure

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
use a Mac universal pressure

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.940 
use a Mac universal pressure
kit<00:03:12.299> and<00:03:12.540> I'll<00:03:12.660> just<00:03:12.870> pressurize<00:03:13.380> from<00:03:13.650> here

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
kit and I'll just pressurize from here

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.759 
kit and I'll just pressurize from here
it's<00:03:14.430> how<00:03:14.519> I<00:03:14.579> troubleshot<00:03:15.150> this<00:03:15.500> so<00:03:16.500> anyway

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
it's how I troubleshot this so anyway

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.740 
it's how I troubleshot this so anyway
that's<00:03:17.280> out<00:03:17.609> you<00:03:17.820> do<00:03:18.000> need<00:03:18.180> to<00:03:18.269> take<00:03:18.419> the<00:03:18.480> valve

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
that's out you do need to take the valve

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.720 
that's out you do need to take the valve
covers<00:03:19.169> off<00:03:19.320> in<00:03:19.530> order<00:03:19.650> to<00:03:19.829> get<00:03:20.100> the<00:03:20.310> intake

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
covers off in order to get the intake

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.580 
covers off in order to get the intake
manifold<00:03:21.299> off<00:03:21.449> I<00:03:21.690> tried<00:03:21.750> without<00:03:22.260> it<00:03:22.410> didn't

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
manifold off I tried without it didn't

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:23.010 
manifold off I tried without it didn't
work

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
work

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:29.430 
work
so<00:03:23.470> this<00:03:24.070> is<00:03:24.220> a<00:03:24.250> 98<00:03:24.820> 5<00:03:25.120> 7<00:03:25.630> k<00:03:26.200> 1500<00:03:28.230> that's<00:03:29.230> all<00:03:29.410> I

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
so this is a 98 5 7 k 1500 that's all I

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.240 
so this is a 98 5 7 k 1500 that's all I
have<00:03:29.650> to<00:03:29.800> say<00:03:29.830> about<00:03:30.220> that<00:03:31.980> we're<00:03:32.980> thinking

have to say about that we're thinking

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.140 
have to say about that we're thinking
clean<00:03:33.850> thoughts<00:03:34.210> look<00:03:34.690> how<00:03:34.870> clean<00:03:35.290> that<00:03:35.320> is

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
clean thoughts look how clean that is

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.810 
clean thoughts look how clean that is
