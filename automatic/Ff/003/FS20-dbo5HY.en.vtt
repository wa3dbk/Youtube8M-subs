00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.870
 I'm working for example before that 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.080
 Unfortunately you have to say poland like that 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.760
 can not become life threatening anymore 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.760
 long then it pops again 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.699
 fireworks rockets böller in germany 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.640
 can you do it from 29 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:30.279
 december buy in poland all year 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.750
 over design louder and more colorful pages the 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.379
 german customer in polish slubice 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:38.400
 and cheaper here in the shop of Jaroslaw 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:38.400
 Grabko is booming the business 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.930
 not every firework is one 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.030
 bargain and admitted in 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.100
 It is not Germany, it is not 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:54.250
 contains a lot of black powder 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:57.940
 Nevertheless, many have already bought here 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:01.920
 and that's why she is commenting on space again 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:05.679
 for 10 or between and is extremely land 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.080
 the notorious polenboller also 

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:09.759
 banned from us if he was afraid that 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.300
 on the way home someone in the bags 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:12.300
 wants to look 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.520
 china monitored around the clock 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.130
 controls the customs in the 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.170
 border areas imports almost all 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.820
 Fireworks from the neighboring countries 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.740
 is prohibited in Germany 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.140
 Who gets caught must have a fine up 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.720
 to pay 50,000 euros 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.180
 after all , this year alone the customs 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.340
 in frankfurt or just under 8000 in poland 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.520
 sold fireworks confiscated 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.950
 because they are dangerously dangerous 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.310
 the burn from poland is that she 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.750
 no testing as it is in 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.890
 Germany from the Federal Institute for 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.530
 material testing and research 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.119
 is subject to with the 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.040
 consequence that you as a buyer 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.740
 can not be sure which 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.439
 explosive is included and if not 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.960
 maybe the böller due to a 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:05.170
 not working early ignition cord 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.410
 in the hand explodes the canton 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.880
 for material research Kurzmann wants that 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.340
 make bollern safer 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.470
 It only recommends New Year's Eve fireworks 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.989
 buy the marked accordingly 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.080
 Otherwise, the fireworks could be like 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:22.330
 in this test 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.900
 to grab the hand right away 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.480
 first tip the bam number the 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.450
 integration or approval number on it 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.900
 is and all stated in German 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.540
 So the usage hints are on it 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.180
 Pay attention that the CE seal of quality and 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.230
 the so-called bam number on the 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.360
 packaging stand 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.120
 only with these numbers are the pictures 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.830
 admitted in Germany 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.230
 then it is still called before the 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.800
 Citizen use instructions carefully 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.940
 read 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.650
 Tip number two you should, of course 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.230
 if it says it like one 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.160
 Battery on a solid level ground 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.930
 put 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.630
 then it really means one 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.660
 asphalt floor and level or on one 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.760
 concrete floor not on a grassy because 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.310
 the object is far too uncertain 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.750
 could overturn if that 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.400
 means the object must be outdoors 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.940
 to be used then yes is too 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.650
 be sure to use outdoors 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.720
 german user manuals mostly 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.300
 Miss you buy somewhere in the 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.940
 abroad like here in poland on the 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:31.570
 Safe side you celebrate when you tip 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.860
 Number three honors a mark 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.420
 such as in Germany 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.890
 prescribed this bank mark 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.610
 Of course, it is also excellent 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.440
 fake 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.820
 really make sure you have one in 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.140
 Germany tested approved 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.690
 fireworks you can only if you 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.720
 actually buy in germany no matter 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.470
 whether in poland or germany 1 applies 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:56.739
 all over 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:59.650
 Tip number four with head so it is 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:02.260
 same as driving when you man 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.660
 drunk driving makes an accident is the same 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.030
 with fireworks, if that 's what they are 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.230
 the toys for the big one but so 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.840
 people not for children 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.790
 because children and adolescents only look 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.209
 to only adults 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.160
 buy and light fireworks and 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:22.900
 if you are sure of the new year 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:25.970
 slip wants a little distance 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.150
 I prefer to watch then is real 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.969
 dangerous 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:34.569
 I still need them all 

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:36.430
 I just need them all 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:38.449
 approved fireworks loud 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.930
 instructions for use safe in the air 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:41.569
 to hunt 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:45.039
 then there is a nice New Year's Eve party 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:45.039
 nothing in the way
