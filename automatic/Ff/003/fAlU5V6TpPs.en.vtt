00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
all of my excavator I

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:13.410 
all of my excavator I
I<00:02:04.500> kind<00:02:05.500> of<00:02:05.590> improvise<00:02:06.220> with<00:02:07.020> some<00:02:12.300> what's<00:02:13.300> it

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
I kind of improvise with some what's it

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.710 
I kind of improvise with some what's it
called<00:02:13.600> grout<00:02:14.230> and<00:02:14.680> sand<00:02:15.490> so<00:02:16.180> now<00:02:16.390> it<00:02:16.540> still

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
called grout and sand so now it still

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.810 
called grout and sand so now it still
has<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:16.900> same<00:02:17.200> texture<00:02:17.740> and<00:02:18.340> it's<00:02:18.490> also<00:02:18.670> a

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
has the same texture and it's also a

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.280 
has the same texture and it's also a
little<00:02:19.000> bit<00:02:19.120> harder<00:02:19.510> so<00:02:19.750> that's<00:02:19.930> pretty<00:02:20.170> cool

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
little bit harder so that's pretty cool

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.180 
little bit harder so that's pretty cool
and<00:02:20.800> if<00:02:21.760> you<00:02:22.300> don't<00:02:22.510> get<00:02:22.750> it<00:02:22.900> to<00:02:23.050> stick<00:02:23.320> you<00:02:24.160> can

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
and if you don't get it to stick you can

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.140 
and if you don't get it to stick you can
also<00:02:24.690> once<00:02:25.690> you<00:02:25.780> have<00:02:26.080> it<00:02:26.260> onto<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:26.890> foam<00:02:27.190> you

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
also once you have it onto the foam you

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.650 
also once you have it onto the foam you
can<00:02:28.740> put<00:02:29.740> like<00:02:29.950> a<00:02:29.980> plastic<00:02:30.370> lid<00:02:30.880> on<00:02:31.060> top<00:02:31.300> and

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.800 
and plant right there and a plant right
there<00:02:55.620> so<00:02:56.620> three<00:02:56.890> plants<00:02:57.190> and<00:02:57.760> then<00:02:58.540> this<00:02:58.750> is

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
there so three plants and then this is

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.210 
there so three plants and then this is
the<00:02:59.170> basking<00:02:59.800> area<00:03:01.230> it's<00:03:02.230> made<00:03:02.500> out<00:03:02.680> of<00:03:02.709> foam

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
the basking area it's made out of foam

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.350 
the basking area it's made out of foam
and<00:03:03.520> then<00:03:04.390> I<00:03:04.810> hollowed<00:03:05.320> out<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.709> foam<00:03:06.360> it's

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
and then I hollowed out the foam it's

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.199 
and then I hollowed out the foam it's
floral<00:03:07.870> foam<00:03:08.080> by<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:08.680> way<00:03:08.860> i<00:03:09.100> hollowed<00:03:09.850> out

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
floral foam by the way i hollowed out

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.229 
floral foam by the way i hollowed out
the<00:03:10.480> foam<00:03:10.780> so<00:03:11.290> that<00:03:11.530> i<00:03:11.560> could<00:03:11.739> put<00:03:12.700> stuff<00:03:12.940> in<00:03:13.120> it

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
the foam so that i could put stuff in it

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.380 
the foam so that i could put stuff in it
so<00:03:13.510> i<00:03:13.750> put<00:03:14.530> three<00:03:15.010> layers<00:03:15.280> of<00:03:15.610> tile<00:03:15.910> in<00:03:16.180> there

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
so i put three layers of tile in there

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.490 
so i put three layers of tile in there
and<00:03:16.720> then<00:03:17.410> I<00:03:17.440> covered<00:03:18.130> it<00:03:18.269> with<00:03:19.269> a<00:03:19.720> mixture<00:03:20.410> of

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
and then I covered it with a mixture of

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.449 
and then I covered it with a mixture of
grout<00:03:20.920> and<00:03:21.190> mortar<00:03:21.700> to<00:03:22.390> secure<00:03:22.900> it<00:03:23.019> and<00:03:23.459> also

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
grout and mortar to secure it and also

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.120 
grout and mortar to secure it and also
added<00:03:24.970> some<00:03:25.360> of<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:25.870> substrate<00:03:26.500> in<00:03:26.680> there

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
added some of the substrate in there

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.300 
added some of the substrate in there
also<00:03:27.750> for<00:03:28.750> the<00:03:28.900> substrate<00:03:29.380> i'm<00:03:29.560> using<00:03:29.950> crushed

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
also for the substrate i'm using crushed

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.300 
also for the substrate i'm using crushed
English<00:03:30.910> walnut<00:03:31.390> shells<00:03:31.920> I've<00:03:32.920> heard<00:03:33.100> they're

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
English walnut shells I've heard they're

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.040 
English walnut shells I've heard they're
really<00:03:33.580> good<00:03:33.760> pre<00:03:33.940> breaded<00:03:34.269> dragons<00:03:34.720> and

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
really good pre breaded dragons and

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.470 
really good pre breaded dragons and
they're<00:03:35.200> also<00:03:35.380> safe<00:03:36.040> if<00:03:36.280> they<00:03:36.430> eat<00:03:36.610> it<00:03:36.790> so

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
they're also safe if they eat it so

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.229 
they're also safe if they eat it so
that's<00:03:37.690> really<00:03:37.930> good<00:03:38.260> and<00:03:38.610> it<00:03:39.610> also<00:03:39.760> looks

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
that's really good and it also looks

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.570 
that's really good and it also looks
really<00:03:40.540> nice<00:03:41.400> so<00:03:42.600> that's<00:03:43.600> the<00:03:43.840> enclosure<00:03:44.230> and

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
really nice so that's the enclosure and

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.520 
really nice so that's the enclosure and
something<00:03:45.580> different<00:03:46.120> about<00:03:46.269> this<00:03:46.630> one<00:03:46.690> is

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
something different about this one is

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:54.060 
something different about this one is
that<00:03:47.590> I<00:03:47.830> can<00:03:49.470> see<00:03:50.489> inside<00:03:51.780> if<00:03:52.780> its<00:03:53.320> hiding<00:03:53.709> or

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
that I can see inside if its hiding or

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.000 
that I can see inside if its hiding or
anything<00:03:54.400> like<00:03:54.430> that<00:03:54.610> so<00:03:55.060> that's<00:03:56.050> also<00:03:56.410> really

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
anything like that so that's also really

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.150 
anything like that so that's also really
cool<00:03:57.370> and<00:03:57.670> the<00:03:58.660> best<00:03:59.019> part<00:03:59.290> about<00:03:59.440> this<00:03:59.890> is

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
cool and the best part about this is

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.640 
cool and the best part about this is
that<00:04:00.280> i<00:04:00.730> made<00:04:01.000> this<00:04:01.690> part<00:04:02.430> removable
