"Maa..."

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.580
"Maa... where will I look for you?"

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.700
"Maa... where will I look for you?"

00:00:52.820 --> 00:01:02.580
"A mother's affection, I have known,
an infant's pain, I realise..."

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.060
"only after I have lost you"

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.980
"Maa... where will I look for you?"

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.980
"Maa..."

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.420
"Mothers are all alike"

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.020
"So are all babies"

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:11.780
"When they are hurt, even
animals shed tears like human beings"

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.820
"Those who were separated,
I have brought together"

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.860
"I have repaid my debt to them..."

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.420
"only after I have lost you, Maa"

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.420
"Maa... where will I
find you ever again?"

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.060
"Maa..."

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:18.700
"You were right when you
said they would curse me"

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:28.580
"You were right when you
said they would curse me"

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:38.460
"Like the times when one
shoots himself with his own gun"

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.420
"What hideous games have I played...?"

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.380
"I cry all by myself today"

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:54.660
"Now that I have lost you, Maa..."

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.140
"where will I ever find you again?"

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.220
"Maa... where will I
find you ever again?"

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.180
"A mother's anguish, I now realise..."

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.140
"an infant's pain, I now feel"

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.700
"All this, after losing you"

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:27.580
"Where will I look for you,
Maa? Where will I ever find you?"

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:34.500
"Maa..."
