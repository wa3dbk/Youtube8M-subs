00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.179
 a very challenging challenge 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.340
 we are the day before down skiing 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:35.520
 the new season begins at montecarlo 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:39.690
 sporting the season that has been 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.829
 built to last with 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.510
 an idea with 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.820
 of completely different situations 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.909
 from the past we have decided to 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.870
 abandon the European championship for 

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:52.440
 incompatibility that those who were 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.860
 goals we wanted to set 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.980
 objectively us 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:00.910
 the premises to fight for the title e 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.740
 so let's try this beginning of vintage 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.020
 here harley of montecarlo that always 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:09.010
 with me he presented a little the beginning 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:10.120
 of the seasons hoping that 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.800
 yahoo 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.800
 A good 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.400
 a good starting point for that 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.400
 that should be 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:34.770
 I am very worried about this 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:38.800
 montecarlo rally 2013 is a race that 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.170
 very difficult in itself 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.700
 selective we did the reconnaissance 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:51.220
 very very difficult conditions test 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:55.360
 very special and I leave with km on 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:57.940
 shoulders of tests and training on the snow 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.670
 we will certainly try to do 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:04.290
 our best to give the maximum e 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.290
 hoping that some good results will come out
