00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:09.059
 we drove onto some strange road 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.889
 with pointers the problem is big we 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:15.299
 would like to go to the overview 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.859
 excursion from the upper slopes and a little bit 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.230
 observed because the pointer is generally 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.039
 no anywhere they were written 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.949
 asphalt 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.430
 almost all worn out and if I'm not the edge 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:30.260
 world 8 and 90 are not visible therefore there they 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:35.250
 stated and on the upper platform in front 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:39.690
 good opens there but the road 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.309
 What is a nightmare than 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.260
 we got higher here 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.089
 some kind of fencing 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.059
 drove there around the turn of the same 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:56.159
 fencing no and just so famous and 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:59.190
 everything can fly there and the road is so 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:02.339
 widths that this car does not miss each other 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.500
 knows the squat but we see there when 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:06.149
 arrived at the very top there some 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.920
 small town 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:13.530
 how the blow can be seen and quite a few cars to 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.200
 in some way 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:24.180
 everyone is ridden by horse 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:24.180
 apples here it is the road there their nightmare 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.690
 so thick 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:34.020
 there is generally a barrier there straight break 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.020
 is coming 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.729
 Well, it is clear that they stood up 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.620
 road, too, all patched, both whom 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.190
 almost like rush 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:03.290
 but our our rush understand everything. 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.500
 now that is gotta be kind and 3 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.460
 we in principle the main principle 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.720
 the plot is probably the most removed 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.520
 unpleasant 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.880
 and maybe even drove it did not have time 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.370
 do you follow the cost get tired and 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:36.830
 connection trial and error 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:42.470
 choose the one because that's which 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:48.130
 intersection is right and left look 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.130
 goats he lichku goats graze 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.750
 alphabet and dry must never
