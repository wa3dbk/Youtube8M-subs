three of those presets for each kit and

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.970

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
then for each of the three presets we

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.009 
then for each of the three presets we
mix<00:02:57.739> all<00:02:57.920> the<00:02:58.400> sound<00:02:58.670> sources<00:02:59.120> for<00:02:59.450> every
