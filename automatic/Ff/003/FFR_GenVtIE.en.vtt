00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.790 
glance that might not seem like a lot
but<00:02:25.970> I<00:02:26.030> think<00:02:26.300> the<00:02:26.390> extra<00:02:26.660> head<00:02:26.870> pieces<00:02:27.140> limbs

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
but I think the extra head pieces limbs

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.910 
but I think the extra head pieces limbs
and<00:02:28.160> stands<00:02:28.610> make<00:02:29.060> up<00:02:29.180> for<00:02:29.390> it<00:02:29.540> and<00:02:29.920> speaking

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
and stands make up for it and speaking

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.770 
and stands make up for it and speaking
of<00:02:31.010> stands<00:02:31.550> let's<00:02:31.970> have<00:02:32.180> a<00:02:32.209> look<00:02:32.420> at<00:02:32.540> what<00:02:32.690> it

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
of stands let's have a look at what it

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:33.220 
of stands let's have a look at what it
comes<00:02:32.959> with

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
comes with

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.070 
comes with
so<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.130> first<00:02:34.340> stand<00:02:34.640> is<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.390> generic<00:02:35.690> stand

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
so the first stand is the generic stand

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.680 
so the first stand is the generic stand
that<00:02:36.290> comes<00:02:36.590> with<00:02:36.800> most<00:02:37.070> if<00:02:37.430> not<00:02:37.489> all<00:02:37.880> newer

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
that comes with most if not all newer

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.670 
that comes with most if not all newer
nindroids<00:02:40.180> then<00:02:41.180> we<00:02:41.330> have<00:02:41.540> a<00:02:41.780> large<00:02:42.110> Sakura

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
nindroids then we have a large Sakura

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.220 
nindroids then we have a large Sakura
flower<00:02:42.980> that<00:02:43.340> serves<00:02:43.640> as<00:02:43.910> a<00:02:43.940> base<00:02:44.330> for<00:02:44.870> me

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.839 

lastly<00:02:49.230> we<00:02:49.440> have<00:02:49.620> a<00:02:49.650> stack<00:02:50.040> of<00:02:50.069> pillows<00:02:50.580> that

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
lastly we have a stack of pillows that

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.490 
lastly we have a stack of pillows that

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.650 
into a couple of issues that I had with
this<00:03:01.409> nindroid<00:03:01.860> while<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.849> figure<00:03:03.120> overall

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
this nindroid while the figure overall

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.140 
this nindroid while the figure overall
is<00:03:03.989> pretty<00:03:04.500> stable<00:03:04.799> I<00:03:05.069> did<00:03:05.280> find<00:03:05.610> a<00:03:05.730> couple<00:03:05.879> of

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
is pretty stable I did find a couple of

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.020 
is pretty stable I did find a couple of
the<00:03:06.299> detachable<00:03:06.690> pieces<00:03:07.440> came<00:03:08.250> off<00:03:08.489> easier

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
the detachable pieces came off easier

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.270 
the detachable pieces came off easier
than<00:03:09.269> others<00:03:09.540> and<00:03:09.870> became<00:03:10.349> a<00:03:10.379> little<00:03:10.769> bit<00:03:11.040> of<00:03:11.160> a

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
than others and became a little bit of a

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.850 
than others and became a little bit of a
pain<00:03:11.549> when<00:03:11.580> I<00:03:12.060> was<00:03:12.299> trying<00:03:12.629> to<00:03:12.959> switch<00:03:13.470> her<00:03:13.680> in

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
visible damage to me but whether it was

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:48.199 
visible damage to me but whether it was
because<00:03:46.799> it<00:03:47.129> was<00:03:47.160> sitting<00:03:47.519> in<00:03:47.609> the<00:03:47.700> box<00:03:47.910> too
