00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
think in Madden in there but I don't

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.080 
think in Madden in there but I don't
know<00:03:02.750> it<00:03:03.230> just<00:03:03.260> really<00:03:03.709> no<00:03:03.829> scheme<00:03:04.250> really<00:03:04.940> to

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
know it just really no scheme really to

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.729 
know it just really no scheme really to
it<00:03:05.239> i<00:03:05.359> don't<00:03:05.510> know<00:03:05.600> maybe<00:03:05.930> he<00:03:06.140> doesn't<00:03:06.320> always

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
it i don't know maybe he doesn't always

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:07.990 
it i don't know maybe he doesn't always
use<00:03:06.920> the<00:03:06.950> broncos<00:03:07.400> or<00:03:07.549> something<00:03:07.880> because

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
use the broncos or something because

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.819 
use the broncos or something because
literally<00:03:08.510> had<00:03:08.720> strong<00:03:08.989> power<00:03:09.230> encounters

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
literally had strong power encounters

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:11.710 
literally had strong power encounters
that<00:03:10.010> he<00:03:10.100> would<00:03:10.220> ever<00:03:10.489> so<00:03:10.700> seldomly<00:03:11.209> mix<00:03:11.510> in

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
that he would ever so seldomly mix in

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.479 
that he would ever so seldomly mix in
and<00:03:11.989> that<00:03:12.560> would<00:03:12.680> really<00:03:12.799> really<00:03:13.010> opened<00:03:13.430> up

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
and that would really really opened up

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.640 
and that would really really opened up
his<00:03:13.579> pass<00:03:13.880> game<00:03:14.180> but<00:03:14.600> i<00:03:14.810> don't<00:03:15.140> know<00:03:15.200> anyway

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
his pass game but i don't know anyway

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
blitzes and of course he runs the ball

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.010 
blitzes and of course he runs the ball
there<00:03:34.130> but<00:03:34.849> now<00:03:35.000> we're<00:03:35.239> you<00:03:35.569> know<00:03:35.660> just<00:03:35.870> having

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.580 
were able to recover thank God you know
so<00:03:53.209> I'm<00:03:53.390> trying<00:03:53.540> to<00:03:53.660> waste<00:03:53.810> some<00:03:54.050> time<00:03:54.080> here

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
so I'm trying to waste some time here

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.860 
so I'm trying to waste some time here
but<00:03:54.800> obviously<00:03:55.220> you<00:03:56.060> guys<00:03:56.180> know<00:03:56.390> how<00:03:56.510> i<00:03:56.540> do<00:03:56.690> it

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
but obviously you guys know how i do it

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.020 
but obviously you guys know how i do it
i<00:03:56.930> get<00:03:57.080> greedy<00:03:57.380> on<00:03:57.620> the<00:03:58.190> fourth<00:03:58.430> and<00:03:58.580> two<00:03:58.670> we<00:03:58.819> do

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
i get greedy on the fourth and two we do

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.580 
i get greedy on the fourth and two we do
get<00:03:59.300> it<00:03:59.420> probably<00:03:59.959> should<00:04:00.019> even<00:04:00.200> possibly

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
get it probably should even possibly

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:01.870 
get it probably should even possibly
thought<00:04:00.769> about<00:04:00.890> kicking<00:04:01.160> a<00:04:01.250> field<00:04:01.430> goal<00:04:01.550> there

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
thought about kicking a field goal there

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.800 
thought about kicking a field goal there
but<00:04:02.120> I<00:04:02.739> didn't<00:04:03.739> so<00:04:04.340> we're<00:04:04.880> going<00:04:05.060> here<00:04:05.569> goes

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
but I didn't so we're going here goes

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.960 
but I didn't so we're going here goes
the<00:04:05.959> greed<00:04:06.200> factor<00:04:06.410> right<00:04:06.739> there<00:04:06.800> and<00:04:07.280> I'll

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
the greed factor right there and I'll

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.059 
the greed factor right there and I'll
lib<00:04:08.209> is<00:04:08.540> a<00:04:08.660> tough<00:04:09.049> corner<00:04:09.470> so<00:04:09.680> I<00:04:09.709> should<00:04:09.980> have

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:10.069 
lib is a tough corner so I should have

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:11.440 
lib is a tough corner so I should have
probably<00:04:10.160> thought<00:04:10.430> twice<00:04:10.670> about<00:04:10.730> before<00:04:11.420> I

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
probably thought twice about before I

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.449 
probably thought twice about before I
did<00:04:11.600> that<00:04:11.630> but<00:04:12.590> we<00:04:12.830> go<00:04:12.950> right<00:04:13.100> back<00:04:13.190> on<00:04:13.340> defense

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
did that but we go right back on defense

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.250 
did that but we go right back on defense
I<00:04:13.760> can't<00:04:14.000> get<00:04:14.150> that<00:04:14.269> that's<00:04:14.600> Scandrick<00:04:15.080> man

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
I can't get that that's Scandrick man

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.800 
I can't get that that's Scandrick man
