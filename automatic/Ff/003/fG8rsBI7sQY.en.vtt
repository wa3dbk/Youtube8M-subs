00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.700
 so hello everyone to a new episode 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.980
 of five things in minecraft you still have 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.630
 did not know how to at the beginning of the 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.010
 same sentence and if you yourself 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.990
 still things to introduce you to 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.310
 Can we send the one by pn 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.510
 and your message with the 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.840
 appropriate even if I turn the 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.510
 to take 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.769
 in the next video shown this video 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.090
 a small exception I had one more 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.529
 a few things so I'm ready 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.699
 I did not want to introduce it 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.179
 so many things have been sent to you 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.830
 are 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.320
 who has any ideas with their raushauen 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.030
 and then there is the next video with 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.129
 your stuff then on the weekend now 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.410
 Today there is a smaller version of 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.390
 I think I chose to talk 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.890
 it is already going on write it 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.640
 many of the five comments 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.719
 you already knew how to share 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.610
 usually there are monsters at 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.270
 daylight start to burn for 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.739
 skeletons, for example, or zombies that are 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.480
 but there is still a small possibility like 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.820
 that do not either they run in 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.350
 Water around or you are running in the shade 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.000
 around the time comes actually known 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.040
 but there is one more point that I knew 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.189
 I do not really yet and though 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.090
 they arise on should then catch the 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.860
 not to burn too 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.260
 even if the blazing sun is on it 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.509
 pops to stand for commercial 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.890
 that would not happen if i did 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.570
 However, the skeleton get out here 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.430
 shove then start to burn 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.070
 can you run yourself back and 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.240
 without the fire it does not hurt or against 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.770
 that would not die before 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.560
 she will be able to stand still 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.759
 without settling but that was up 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.380
 changed your mind and chose to die 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.909
 decided based exactly how it is 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.979
 just run away and get 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.439
 accordingly, it is easy to harm 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.470
 but purely from the actual ever 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.360
 just stand on it happen kg 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.119
 now I have placed in the zombie 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.470
 come I already had very 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.210
 because if you put me that 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.770
 others placed in it in the 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.119
 block handles or in blocks of the 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.509
 zombie is in it then that works 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.210
 Not 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.920
 then briefly to the side is thus in the 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.009
 corner 11 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.860
 daniela kainz so the mob is not 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.049
 each other in the disturb so much 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.640
 this works in any case in 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.290
 what he does not know the individual corners 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.270
 now in third place her 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.420
 partly then we start to 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.120
 separate 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.440
 so there should be prevented pug from 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.849
 brenders means you can be in the allegiance 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.110
 create if you keep pug trapped 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:20.500
 just wanted with sauces and down 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.330
 do not want to burn well there 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.670
 next cake are delicious cakes 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.140
 are beautiful and you have them I think 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.030
 not so often generally minecraft when 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.190
 you inevitably need the other 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.140
 However, there are better food types 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.430
 is there two little things in there? 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.260
 which still disturb a bit 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.730
 namely when you place a cake 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.120
 has destroyed a blog under it 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.769
 he just disappears that's how I hold it 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.750
 a little bit of a year for a bug 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.910
 somehow because theoretically the 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.080
 really casual work down the item again 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.330
 I actually think so and what 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.709
 Meaningful name disappears just like 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.299
 if you ski the whole thing with one 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.310
 shifts then he disappears too 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:56.319
 if it were some of the most meaningful 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:00.250
 the part would not drop anyway 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:02.350
 it is the case with melons in her 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.299
 rewarding example, move the slopes Chancellor 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.830
 and then the troops get out too 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.510
 In fact, I think it makes sense 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.180
 but is made out of cake it 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.650
 does not work yet 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.660
 you can put picture frames on pretty much 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.940
 Everything depends on where it is 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.920
 actually makes no sense, for example, of 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.320
 the anvil or here normal command 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.989
 block 1 hop on the side at over one 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:26.530
 glass pane would have fun next 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:28.269
 Among other things, we still have some cake 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.280
 does it work you can take pictures 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.739
 cake hanging on sign 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.209
 interestingly, what were we? 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.170
 it's just kinda crazy 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.540
 pointless now I can completely 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.480
 then it can also go through 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.000
 doors dranhÃ¤ngen again a frames like that 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.420
 and open the turkey then open 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.400
 shut down 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.200
 and you can theoretically so again 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.609
 The doors can be completely outside 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.030
 pull the whole thing once 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:53.290
 there is no idea what that is 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.200
 to be white works as well 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.940
 nor can go through and you can 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.069
 for example, it still s.Zauber 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.519
 Place your tables for whatever reason 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:02.799
 always 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:04.239
 and it can be synonymous s.ne needed 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.950
 Place a picture I know now 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:09.310
 not why must I do it below 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:13.269
 By the way, but yes it is useless 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:15.340
 but still I do not have it yet 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.810
 gives a simple way of crates 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.340
 complete in minecraft so to speak 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.080
 Of course, everyone can do this 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.849
 quotation marks clavicle powers 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.500
 and she's not that crazy 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:24.000
 but still, I knew so too 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.070
 not yet 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.620
 and that if you placed a box 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.970
 then placed there you can 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.170
 Do not open these because over the 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.580
 crate you a block is located 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.530
 if you like it 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.810
 excludes with a diamond or no matter 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.180
 repeatedly on the click on zack you can 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.830
 just look as long as we fall above 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.150
 accordingly, market is when i 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.830
 now it so go there again 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.180
 normal then i can not do it anymore 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.590
 open as a key once 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.760
 right click on it then you can 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:52.110
 open otherwise it's not and as 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.610
 last one more interesting fact the 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.190
 you do not even think twice 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:59.160
 namely gourds are actually 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.630
 less common than diamonds 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.790
 either you just get the seeds out 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.510
 the boxes out of the shafts or 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.680
 like 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.540
 that means there are, however, too 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.070
 diamonds and others or one 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.410
 on the other hand one finds the gourds 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.630
 just like that somewhere in the area that 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.490
 means in the meadow or and and trees or 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.560
 other of the minecraft world distributed 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.880
 however, they are so rarely distributed 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.110
 so it's much easier to diamonds too 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.640
 because diamonds 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.110
 there is a lively occurrence 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:23.340
 underground that is at the height of 10 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.910
 to 16 just go out and I have to 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.040
 dig over 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.500
 There are many more diamonds than that 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:31.200
 easy gourds for whatever reason 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.460
 I know I'm there now 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:34.020
 it logically I have never turn 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.000
 Gourds are rare 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.510
 as diamonds we have to be a currency 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.660
 introduce 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:41.520
 ok then how much did you know about the 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.890
 five because there were now I believe 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.290
 not so cool stuff but it 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.490
 Nevertheless, all should not necessarily 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.840
 know everything 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.130
 it's always such a thing to me 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.060
 maybe noticed as a sentence too 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.800
 to follow the last ones 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.479
 that everything is completely simple and every time 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.970
 I know everything, I look a bit like that 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:58.770
 Comments are not that you are 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.120
 each one is alone or on its own 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.340
 maybe clear if you have much of it 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.500
 Everything but there are also people to know 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.390
 that does not look at it from there 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.919
 next video, there are the things 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:09.570
 a bit harder of you 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:11.070
 maybe and then let's see how 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:13.520
 far he comes there until the next episode 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.520
 and shoot
