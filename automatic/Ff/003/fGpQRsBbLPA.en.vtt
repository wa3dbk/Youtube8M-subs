00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.370
 this is the tequendama jump one of 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.740
 The biggest tourist attractions in 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.869
 our country one of the emblems and 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.520
 cultural environmental symbols and 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.520
 historical facts that we have in the region 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.030
 Welcome to this in the house-museum 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.460
 tequendama formerly known as the 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:34.960
 Hotel del salto is a house of origin 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:38.140
 republican built in 1923 the house 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.300
 as such it has a thousand 472 square meters 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.530
 So far we have been able to recover the 10 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.230
 percent of it 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.579
 and the idea is to enable its five levels 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.579
 as a museum 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.950
 since the year 94 we arrived in the area 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.470
 we found some native forests in very 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.620
 good state of preservation where it still 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:04.290
 retains much native fauna and flora what 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.450
 It is indicating that effectively despite 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.300
 ourselves as bad citizens 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.330
 that we are the ecosystem refuses to 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.760
 disappear and our effort has been 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.230
 precisely aimed at giving you a hand 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.520
 to the ecosystem so that it can be 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:22.800
 keep regenerating and rehabilitate as 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.780
 It must have always remained 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.970
 originally this space in which 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.940
 we are right now was the music room 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.130
 of the hotel of the jump today is one of 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.410
 the exhibition rooms at this moment 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.560
 we have the window exhibition 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:40.380
 citizen to the river bogotÃ¡ what we 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.200
 we pretend it is first that people are 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.810
 aware of his participation in the 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.440
 usufruct of the river but also see how 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.440
 is going to compromise 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.060
 the house is the pretext the house-museum is 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.409
 the pretext for us all that 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.570
 knowledge that has been acquired during 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.149
 several years then let it be known to the 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.329
 people and that each one is a companion 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:05.000
 more in this work so strong that it is 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:07.100
 conserve the environment 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.500
 the invitation is for us to visit 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.390
 Saturdays Sundays and holidays we are in 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.910
 the house-museum tequendama of 8 of the 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.830
 tomorrow at 4 in the afternoon always 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.950
 We tell our visitors that what 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.960
 more can they contribute and better the 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.670
 The best gift we can give you is 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.709
 tell them a little bit how to be a good 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.450
 Colombian for us to be good 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.709
 Colombian is not to tie the flag 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.690
 the day he plays colombia against 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.090
 Argentina is defending its heritage 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.420
 natural and this is a good scenario for 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.420
 start
