the<00:03:04.970> morning<00:03:05.450> and<00:03:05.959> I'm<00:03:06.320> supposed<00:03:06.680> to<00:03:06.770> be<00:03:06.890> quiet

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
the morning and I'm supposed to be quiet

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.550 
the morning and I'm supposed to be quiet
so<00:03:08.000> I'm<00:03:08.480> probably<00:03:08.720> still<00:03:08.930> a<00:03:09.110> little<00:03:09.200> bit<00:03:09.350> loud

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
so I'm probably still a little bit loud

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.990 
so I'm probably still a little bit loud
talk<00:03:10.430> but<00:03:10.790> not<00:03:11.030> that<00:03:11.900> loud<00:03:12.170> so<00:03:12.500> the<00:03:12.560> neighbors

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
talk but not that loud so the neighbors

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.550 
talk but not that loud so the neighbors
next<00:03:14.000> door<00:03:14.180> can<00:03:14.780> hear<00:03:15.110> me<00:03:16.300> sneaky<00:03:17.300> sneaky<00:03:17.560> okay
