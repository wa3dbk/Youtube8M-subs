 With that she knows herself as the frontwoman of the band named after her 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.340
 she had already made a name for herself in the hard rock scene 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.750

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.640
 what I want to do is to handle it I said okay 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.350

 Newcomer 1 percent 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.379
 actually helpful at some point 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.349
 but there are many things you can do what it is 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.349

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.999
