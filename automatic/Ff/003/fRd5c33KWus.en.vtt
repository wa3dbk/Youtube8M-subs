does each camp the bruiser can end the

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.840 
does each camp the bruiser can end the
boss<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:41.500> first<00:00:41.710> type<00:00:41.950> is<00:00:41.980> this<00:00:42.250> each<00:00:42.460> camp

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
boss the first type is this each camp

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.450 
boss the first type is this each camp
there's<00:00:43.510> a<00:00:43.570> quite<00:00:44.020> long<00:00:44.200> range<00:00:44.500> which<00:00:44.920> is<00:00:44.950> even

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
there's a quite long range which is even

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.040 
there's a quite long range which is even
longer<00:00:45.610> than<00:00:45.970> the<00:00:46.090> range<00:00:46.270> of<00:00:46.390> the<00:00:46.540> towers<00:00:46.870> and

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
longer than the range of the towers and

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.100 
longer than the range of the towers and
forts<00:00:47.470> and<00:00:47.680> they<00:00:48.280> deal<00:00:48.790> decent<00:00:49.330> damage<00:00:49.480> but

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 
also have very low health so that means

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.960 
also have very low health so that means
they<00:00:53.199> are<00:00:53.260> strong<00:00:53.590> without<00:00:53.800> a<00:00:54.040> defending

some health and maybe some abilities

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.810 
some health and maybe some abilities
aren't<00:01:52.110> cool<00:01:52.380> on<00:01:52.590> because<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.070> use<00:01:53.280> them<00:01:53.580> to

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
aren't cool on because you use them to

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.600 
aren't cool on because you use them to
capture<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.540> camp<00:01:54.840> faster<00:01:55.500> in<00:01:56.310> these

capture the camp faster in these

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.060 
capture the camp faster in these
situations<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.840> enemy<00:01:58.200> obviously<00:01:58.800> has<00:01:58.980> an

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
situations the enemy obviously has an

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.400 
situations the enemy obviously has an
advantage<00:01:59.490> of<00:01:59.820> the<00:01:59.910> fight<00:02:00.210> so<00:02:00.900> it's<00:02:01.140> quite

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
advantage of the fight so it's quite

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.710 
advantage of the fight so it's quite
likely<00:02:01.680> that<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.310> died<00:02:02.580> and<00:02:02.850> denied<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.420> camp

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
likely that you died and denied the camp

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.960 
likely that you died and denied the camp
to<00:02:03.930> your<00:02:04.080> enemy<00:02:04.470> so<00:02:05.070> if<00:02:05.190> you<00:02:05.310> don't<00:02:05.580> have<00:02:05.730> any

you<00:03:53.900> kill<00:03:54.110> some<00:03:54.410> heroes<00:03:55.040> but<00:03:55.340> most<00:03:55.640> times<00:03:55.790> it's

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
you kill some heroes but most times it's

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.240 
you kill some heroes but most times it's
more<00:03:56.209> effective<00:03:56.569> to<00:03:56.810> get<00:03:57.110> a<00:03:57.140> mercenary<00:03:57.860> camp

more effective to get a mercenary camp
or<00:03:58.459> a<00:03:58.489> boss<00:03:58.900> so<00:03:59.900> your<00:04:00.230> push<00:04:00.500> is<00:04:00.739> even<00:04:01.040> stronger

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
or a boss so your push is even stronger

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.569 
or a boss so your push is even stronger
an<00:04:02.780> example<00:04:03.650> when<00:04:03.769> it's<00:04:03.920> better<00:04:04.130> to<00:04:04.340> push

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
an example when it's better to push

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:07.030 
an example when it's better to push
yourself<00:04:04.760> is<00:04:05.480> when<00:04:06.260> you're<00:04:06.410> able<00:04:06.590> to<00:04:06.860> finish

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
yourself is when you're able to finish

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.220 
yourself is when you're able to finish
the<00:04:07.340> game<00:04:07.519> before<00:04:07.970> the<00:04:08.000> enemy<00:04:08.390> is<00:04:08.840> alive<00:04:09.200> again

the game before the enemy is alive again

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.949 
the game before the enemy is alive again
so<00:04:09.890> if<00:04:10.130> you<00:04:10.250> killed<00:04:10.519> them<00:04:10.730> all<00:04:11.060> at<00:04:11.450> their<00:04:11.720> keep

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
so if you killed them all at their keep

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.080 
so if you killed them all at their keep
and<00:04:12.170> they're<00:04:12.500> dead<00:04:12.709> for<00:04:12.920> at<00:04:13.010> least<00:04:13.130> 30<00:04:13.579> seconds

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
then it will be a huge risk especially

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.370 
then it will be a huge risk especially
because<00:05:34.430> the<00:05:34.760> enemy<00:05:35.120> will<00:05:35.300> probably<00:05:35.870> come<00:05:36.140> to

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:36.380 
because the enemy will probably come to

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.500 
because the enemy will probably come to
this<00:05:36.530> camp<00:05:36.860> as<00:05:37.130> well<00:05:37.430> if<00:05:37.640> you<00:05:37.820> didn't<00:05:38.270> capture

this camp as well if you didn't capture
it<00:05:38.810> already<00:05:39.230> then<00:05:39.830> you<00:05:39.950> might<00:05:40.190> lose<00:05:40.490> the<00:05:40.730> fight

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:40.910 
it already then you might lose the fight

it already then you might lose the fight
again<00:05:41.330> and<00:05:41.660> you<00:05:41.810> are<00:05:41.960> falling<00:05:42.320> even<00:05:42.680> more

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:42.860

behind in these situations it's better

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.040 
behind in these situations it's better

you out at defending the golem if you

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.570 
you out at defending the golem if you
