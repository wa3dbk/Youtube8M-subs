 with corrective the corrective a little bit 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.529
 It 's not always clear what I do 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.050

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.380
 moisturize skin well tozoni treatment 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.270
 minerals late the appointment of my 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.730
 son of the golden maicon 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.290
 I'm loving it, it's really light and really 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.290
 pretty date skin 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.309
 she starts to pass a concealer is that 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.280
 I'm in the phoenix studio of the little machine. 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.800
 in c 42 counted in exactly the same tone 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.530
 of my skin is and with this collective 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:09.560
 cover any imperfections all 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.560
 stains all the scars on the face 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:38.479
 that same corrective 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.479
 I use to disguise the dark circles is this 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.220
 collective even our whole skin will not 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.800
 give that effect a car lets 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.710
 that effect made to light the face 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.470
 it's really just to disguise 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.130
 remembering that your basic skin 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.130
 day by day 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:06.810
 and how you can see applications all over 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.369
 done with my finger on her that I say 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.369
 lighter than the judge has up his sleeve 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:18.150
 I'm going to use it now for pf flash that 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.580
 is a translucent silica that helps 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.390
 seal all of this concealer in the area of 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.680
 eyes 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:29.269
 without kaka and without leaving accumulation of 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.269
 correction in this area 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.290
 different from ordinary 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.630
 it may be that I can super end then 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:44.060
 can be used quietly in the 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.060
 from the eyes come that he wants that 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:51.510
 next step is to use a powder 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.630
 I chose this dust of music forever 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:58.140

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.090
 base powder it a powder base ie it 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.769
 have a little better coverage one 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.110
 differential coverage 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:07.530
 I'm using this powder with a paintbrush 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.690
 kabuki not to leave the application as 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.299
 loaded but if I wanted application 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:15.350
 even stronger was just to pass this dust 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.350
 with sponge 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.939

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:50.200
 want to contour and gives more 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:50.200
 definition of my face 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:12.519

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.519

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.729
 reinforced in my basic outline of the day 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:00.270
