00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
picking up on it pretty quickly and you

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.670

know<00:01:12.360> they<00:01:12.510> they<00:01:12.990> really<00:01:13.229> seem<00:01:13.380> like<00:01:13.530> they're

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
know they they really seem like they're

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.560 
know they they really seem like they're
getting<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.310> grasp<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.670> what<00:01:14.790> we're<00:01:14.909> telling

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.580 

ya<00:01:18.570> with<00:01:18.689> ensuring<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.110> kids<00:01:19.320> out<00:01:19.439> on<00:01:19.470> the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
ya with ensuring the kids out on the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.380 
ya with ensuring the kids out on the
track<00:01:19.890> I<00:01:20.189> think<00:01:20.400> once<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:20.939> show<00:01:21.180> them<00:01:21.240> the

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
track I think once you show them the

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.969 
track I think once you show them the
jumps<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.750> couple<00:01:21.990> times<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.439> they<00:01:22.530> get<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.799> see

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
jumps a couple times and they get to see

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.340 
jumps a couple times and they get to see
it<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.250> think<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.580> really<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.780> really<00:01:24.810> sinks<00:01:25.259> in

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
it I think it really it really sinks in

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.749 
it I think it really it really sinks in
as<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.530> can<00:01:25.650> see<00:01:25.830> they<00:01:25.950> try<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.189> emulate<00:01:26.430> what

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
as you can see they try and emulate what

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.700 
as you can see they try and emulate what
the<00:01:26.850> guys<00:01:26.970> are<00:01:27.000> doing<00:01:27.180> so<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:27.900> far<00:01:28.290> so<00:01:28.350> good

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
the guys are doing so so far so good

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.859 
the guys are doing so so far so good
