00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.140 
he played well he's a good player but it
just<00:01:40.590> was<00:01:40.829> like<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.310> deck<00:01:41.490> was<00:01:41.640> set<00:01:41.850> up<00:01:41.939> four

meters<00:01:42.509> so<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:43.409> was<00:01:43.680> pretty<00:01:44.130> tough<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.430> beat

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
meters so it was pretty tough to beat

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
heated pretty angry and that was

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.380 
heated pretty angry and that was
uncalled<00:02:26.500> for<00:02:26.800> but<00:02:27.040> it<00:02:27.310> was<00:02:27.400> emotional<00:02:27.640> and<00:02:28.150> I

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
uncalled for but it was emotional and I

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.110 
uncalled for but it was emotional and I
understand<00:02:29.050> some<00:02:29.530> of<00:02:29.560> it<00:02:29.770> and<00:02:29.950> since<00:02:30.790> he<00:02:30.940> came

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
understand some of it and since he came

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.450 
understand some of it and since he came
out<00:02:31.180> and<00:02:31.740> eventually<00:02:32.740> did<00:02:33.130> out<00:02:33.250> of<00:02:33.280> the

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460

guarantee I definitely forgive him for
it<00:02:35.650> I<00:02:35.800> think<00:02:36.300> more<00:02:37.300> generally<00:02:37.330> I<00:02:37.780> think<00:02:37.840> it's<00:02:38.200> a

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
it I think more generally I think it's a

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.620 
it I think more generally I think it's a
really<00:02:38.560> good<00:02:38.680> reason<00:02:39.610> for<00:02:39.940> people<00:02:40.060> to<00:02:40.240> never

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
really good reason for people to never

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.380 
really good reason for people to never
estimate<00:02:41.170> prize<00:02:41.440> pools<00:02:41.770> because<00:02:42.550> just<00:02:43.150> saying

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
estimate prize pools because just saying

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.240 
estimate prize pools because just saying
something<00:02:43.810> is<00:02:43.930> going<00:02:44.260> to<00:02:44.380> be<00:02:44.470> 5<00:02:44.770> million<00:02:45.040> euros

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
something is going to be 5 million euros

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.820 
something is going to be 5 million euros
means<00:02:45.460> nothing<00:02:45.880> they<00:02:46.330> could<00:02:46.390> say<00:02:46.510> it<00:02:46.840> as<00:02:47.470> you

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
means nothing they could say it as you

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.830 
means nothing they could say it as you
know<00:02:47.950> estimated<00:02:48.400> for<00:02:48.550> 50<00:02:48.850> million<00:02:49.150> if<00:02:49.540> it

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
know estimated for 50 million if it

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.210 
know estimated for 50 million if it
doesn't<00:02:50.110> mean<00:02:50.200> anything<00:02:50.230> why<00:02:50.650> even<00:02:50.890> write<00:02:51.070> it

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
doesn't mean anything why even write it

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.940 
doesn't mean anything why even write it
so<00:02:51.880> it<00:02:52.480> avoids<00:02:52.900> a<00:02:53.170> lot<00:02:53.260> of<00:02:53.350> confusion<00:02:53.650> when<00:02:53.860> you

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
so it avoids a lot of confusion when you

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.560 
so it avoids a lot of confusion when you
don't<00:02:54.130> have<00:02:54.280> that<00:02:54.490> so<00:02:55.030> hopefully<00:02:55.420> other

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
don't have that so hopefully other

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.120 
don't have that so hopefully other
casinos<00:02:56.020> will<00:02:56.170> see<00:02:56.320> this<00:02:56.500> and<00:02:56.740> think<00:02:56.800> well

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
casinos will see this and think well

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.160 
casinos will see this and think well
that<00:02:57.970> didn't<00:02:58.180> work<00:02:58.210> out<00:02:58.480> so<00:02:58.540> well<00:02:58.720> for<00:02:58.870> them

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
that didn't work out so well for them

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.310 
that didn't work out so well for them
and<00:02:59.380> maybe<00:03:00.370> we<00:03:00.580> should<00:03:00.760> not<00:03:00.910> do<00:03:01.090> that<00:03:01.320> learn

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
and maybe we should not do that learn

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.930 
and maybe we should not do that learn
from<00:03:02.470> their<00:03:02.650> mistake<00:03:03.010> yeah<00:03:03.340> well<00:03:03.640> let's<00:03:03.790> talk

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
from their mistake yeah well let's talk

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.720

just<00:03:19.900> not<00:03:20.110> big<00:03:20.380> at<00:03:20.590> all<00:03:20.709> obviously<00:03:21.190> but<00:03:21.520> i<00:03:21.730> I've

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
just not big at all obviously but i I've

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.940 
just not big at all obviously but i I've
never<00:03:22.450> played<00:03:22.750> before<00:03:22.930> so<00:03:23.500> I<00:03:23.560> wanted<00:03:23.770> to<00:03:23.830> learn

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
never played before so I wanted to learn

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.199 
never played before so I wanted to learn
the<00:03:24.070> game<00:03:24.190> but<00:03:24.370> I'd<00:03:24.489> want<00:03:24.640> to<00:03:24.670> learn<00:03:24.760> for<00:03:25.030> free

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
the game but I'd want to learn for free

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.560 
the game but I'd want to learn for free
because<00:03:25.620> then<00:03:26.620> no<00:03:26.770> one<00:03:26.890> cares<00:03:27.130> so<00:03:27.910> we<00:03:28.330> played

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
because then no one cares so we played

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:29.970 
because then no one cares so we played
for<00:03:28.750> one<00:03:28.870> year<00:03:28.959> a<00:03:29.020> point<00:03:29.350> we<00:03:29.470> played<00:03:29.680> one<00:03:29.950> round

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
for one year a point we played one round

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.940 
for one year a point we played one round
of<00:03:30.489> four<00:03:30.940> hands<00:03:31.270> and<00:03:31.600> I<00:03:31.690> want<00:03:31.840> 50<00:03:32.140> points<00:03:32.470> so<00:03:32.650> I

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
of four hands and I want 50 points so I

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.360 
of four hands and I want 50 points so I
guess<00:03:33.850> I<00:03:34.660> know<00:03:34.840> and<00:03:35.260> Jay<00:03:35.530> was<00:03:35.650> talking<00:03:35.920> to<00:03:36.220> play

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
guess I know and Jay was talking to play

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.580 
guess I know and Jay was talking to play
for<00:03:36.430> five<00:03:36.910> or<00:03:36.940> ten<00:03:37.330> years<00:03:37.360> a<00:03:37.600> point<00:03:37.900> and<00:03:38.170> of

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
for five or ten years a point and of

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.229 
for five or ten years a point and of
course<00:03:38.920> it's<00:03:39.070> not<00:03:39.130> a<00:03:39.340> lot<00:03:39.610> because<00:03:39.850> they<00:03:40.060> play

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
course it's not a lot because they play

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.479 
course it's not a lot because they play
for<00:03:40.510> a<00:03:40.720> ton<00:03:41.080> sometimes<00:03:41.530> but<00:03:41.860> I<00:03:42.100> don't<00:03:42.430> even

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:43.949 
for a ton sometimes but I don't even
know<00:03:42.610> how<00:03:42.700> to<00:03:42.730> play<00:03:42.910> and<00:03:43.150> I'm<00:03:43.180> a<00:03:43.239> huge<00:03:43.570> dog<00:03:43.810> in

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760
