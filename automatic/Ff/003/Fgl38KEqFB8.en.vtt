00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.930
 good to all I am pot and good here you 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.360
 I bring a video so you can see how it 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.580
 puts the modern warfare 2 menu without 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.380
 have pirate play you will only have to 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.540
 subscribe to the glitch channel that what 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.980
 you will have in the description and they will pass 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.290
 to a file because you put it in the 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.570
 pendrive and once you have the 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.400
 post file and terol on the pendrive 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.010
 you put it in the usb that we are 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.040
 near the reader and once you have 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.500
 done this you enter modern warfare2 and 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.590
 we send you a message to invite you 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.600
 to activate the menu some of that and if not 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.670
 It's busy because I guess you 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.309
 will invite and once we invite you 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.350
 invite a private party will be in the 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.299
 meeting point and you will see that down in 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.449
 the photo of the map comes out some rare letters 

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:58.070
 once you've seen that from the 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:59.510
 Strawberry that comes out with the letters and 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.809
 such down where the map of the jce for 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.580
 back you go to split screen you load 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.460
 a profile you create a new one if not 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.189
 you have not even six games when you start 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.500
 split screen game if you see that 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:15.049
 you give the cl and then the arrow of 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.550
 up if you see that you get some letters 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.650
 That means that we have activated 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.650
 and well then we just have to go to 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.050
 Private game and we could play 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.920
 go with the menu play with colleagues and 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:32.220
 so do not use it in online game because 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.230
 you are going to fuck the multiplayer and is that 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.300
 It's not worth it either because the menu 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.040
 this has almost nothing like that to fuck 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.400
 he does not have forces either, so we 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.100
 you are going to do nothing and well we enter 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.010
 in a private game and you will have enough 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.040
 you can raise the prestige or 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:53.090
 change the level to put on the titles 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.250
 and emblems change game modes and 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.890
 infections there are several things also by 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.080
 there to take the ac 130 or something 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.870
 of those I think and good as I said yes 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.340
 you want the menu subscribe to the channel 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.890
 clicks that you will have your channel in the 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.010
 description and so I lend a hand with 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.360
 the channel and also lobbies in other 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.330
 call of duty so if you want something 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:18.830
 go through your channel and talk to him and 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.830
 nothing more until the next 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.960
 because it's expensive and it will be called stable 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.820
 Y 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.510
 i 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.870
 4 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.870
 Y 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.180
 Hello 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.340
