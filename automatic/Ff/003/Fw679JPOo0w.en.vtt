 add style to your html that is 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:32.250

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.450
 places somehow allocated do some 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:18.780

 small css birds and repeated it more than once 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.479
 your past video lessons if you have them 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:32.040

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.689
 helped here in this lesson we have nothing 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.790

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.280
 introductory video lesson what I want 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.479
 say that looking at all my 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:45.720
 video tutorials search css you can learn 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:51.619
 how the language itself also consolidate your knowledge 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:54.090
 by html language and also at the end of this 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.939
 these video lessons we will create 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.659
 such a small site based on html + 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.790
 css 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.070
 it will be a simple site but it will be 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.680
 the main site of course on the internet we have it 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.390
 we will not fill in principle if you 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.849
 want to pour it on the internet then 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.280
 You can pour it will be paid 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.020
 Well, in principle, this is another topic if 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.280

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.260

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.030
 here it will be such a full-fledged site in 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.240
