00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:08.179
 the people of youtube today we are going to see the 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:13.110
 basic care about a stone fish or 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:17.470
 damage radio first thing 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.750
 sexual differences as they see that 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:24.289
 is there a little more chubby that has 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:27.500
 so the most chubby belly is a female 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:30.820
 and those that look thinner like the one that 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:34.680
 it's there near her 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:37.950
 he is a male 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.840
 feeding 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:45.590
 can eat 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:48.040
 tropical mix of hannah these are the 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.040
 balls 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:00.550
 and also 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:03.750
 it's cameras or you play 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:08.720
 they can eat that too 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:12.479
 These fish can measure 5 centimeters 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:17.660
 at the temperature temperature should be 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.660
 from 21 to 27 degrees 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.000
 the behavior 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:34.780
 At least four copies are 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:37.530
 presented are peaceful but it happens that 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:41.619
 in doing is riding with quepis because 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:47.020
 they begin to peck the fins since 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:50.690
 these fish eat digits so flies 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:54.800
 and that will go 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:57.000
 food can be tomatoed like 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.930
 I have them here 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.930
 Pine trees 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:08.540
 cucumber and that and what they teach 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:14.530
 that's it 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:14.530
 and eye flakes 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.440
 good not 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.440
 to see that I forgot 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:52.060
 Well, this is good, here came the aquarium 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:56.060
 more fish characteristics we will already do 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:03:01.480
 characteristics of the zebra fish 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.480
 I already did it right now 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.680
 all reproductions 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:14.390
 the reproductions with at least it gets 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.319
 more or less it is advisable to put three 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:20.890
 males for a female 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:24.680
 and you have to throw them a bulb the 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:27.439
 smaller 10-15 liter more or less 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.370
 when you are already exposed a morning 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:35.319
 flower to go through the eggs 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.319
 because through in the eggs 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.510
 and they fall there our dream lie 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.510
 when we have 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.550
 then have the eggs no longer have the 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.220
 littlest belly already happened to them 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:53.730
 big aquarium and the fry and and 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:56.010
 when they grow up , they can be passed on to 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:00.560
 large aquarium 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.560
