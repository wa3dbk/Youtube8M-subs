speaker cabinet it's got a Celestion g12
12-inch<00:01:53.450> speaker<00:01:54.320> in<00:01:54.619> there<00:01:54.799> so<00:01:54.950> that's<00:01:55.130> a

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
12-inch speaker in there so that's a

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.090 
12-inch speaker in there so that's a
very<00:01:55.399> good<00:01:55.640> quality<00:01:55.909> speaker<00:01:56.679> adds<00:01:57.679> to<00:01:57.979> the

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
very good quality speaker adds to the

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.520 
very good quality speaker adds to the
kind<00:01:58.310> of<00:01:58.399> dynamics<00:01:58.940> or<00:01:59.179> of<00:01:59.659> the<00:01:59.810> amp<00:01:59.960> and<00:02:00.259> the

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
kind of dynamics or of the amp and the

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.059 
kind of dynamics or of the amp and the
way<00:02:00.710> it<00:02:00.860> reacts<00:02:01.190> with<00:02:01.369> the<00:02:01.490> guitar<00:02:02.619> for<00:02:03.619> the<00:02:03.740> EQ

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
way it reacts with the guitar for the EQ

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:05.620 
way it reacts with the guitar for the EQ
section<00:02:04.100> we've<00:02:04.640> got<00:02:04.789> a<00:02:04.819> really<00:02:05.149> simple<00:02:05.509> which

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
section we've got a really simple which

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.190 
section we've got a really simple which
I<00:02:05.720> kind<00:02:05.899> of<00:02:05.929> like<00:02:05.990> a<00:02:06.170> really<00:02:06.380> simple<00:02:06.890> kind<00:02:07.190> of

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
I kind of like a really simple kind of

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.680 
I kind of like a really simple kind of
approach<00:02:09.200> we've<00:02:09.560> got<00:02:09.709> one<00:02:10.069> one<00:02:10.940> knob<00:02:11.269> always

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
approach we've got one one knob always

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.979 
approach we've got one one knob always
good<00:02:11.870> to<00:02:11.989> every<00:02:12.170> one<00:02:12.260> knob<00:02:12.470> instead<00:02:12.800> of<00:02:12.920> ten

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
good to every one knob instead of ten

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.110 
good to every one knob instead of ten
turn<00:02:14.989> it<00:02:15.140> one<00:02:15.290> way<00:02:15.500> you<00:02:15.860> get<00:02:15.980> more<00:02:16.010> top<00:02:16.459> so<00:02:16.880> if<00:02:17.030> I

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
turn it one way you get more top so if I

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.320 
turn it one way you get more top so if I
turn<00:02:17.330> it<00:02:17.450> all<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.569> way

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.510 

turn<00:02:21.260> it<00:02:21.380> the<00:02:21.470> other<00:02:21.500> way<00:02:21.800> and<00:02:22.070> you<00:02:22.130> get<00:02:22.430> my

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
turn it the other way and you get my

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.430 
turn it the other way and you get my

real simple approach and it's a it's a
good<00:02:29.510> discipline<00:02:29.930> to<00:02:30.050> have<00:02:30.140> an<00:02:30.380> amp<00:02:30.500> like<00:02:30.650> this

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
good discipline to have an amp like this

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.100 
good discipline to have an amp like this
because<00:02:31.220> you<00:02:31.400> get<00:02:31.610> it<00:02:32.360> teaches<00:02:32.690> you<00:02:32.810> how<00:02:33.080> to

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
than the rather than the amp kind of

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.880 
than the rather than the amp kind of
controlling<00:02:38.240> you<00:02:38.600> you<00:02:38.810> get<00:02:39.560> a<00:02:39.620> lot<00:02:39.860> of

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
controlling you you get a lot of

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.260 
controlling you you get a lot of
dynamics<00:02:40.460> with<00:02:40.580> amps<00:02:40.760> like<00:02:40.910> this<00:02:41.030> that<00:02:41.180> you

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
dynamics with amps like this that you

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.230 
one thing I forgot to mention about amps
like<00:04:39.260> these<00:04:39.470> is<00:04:39.680> they<00:04:39.860> they<00:04:40.130> react<00:04:40.639> really

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
like these is they they react really

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.600 
like these is they they react really
nicely<00:04:41.479> with<00:04:41.900> certain<00:04:42.770> pedals<00:04:43.099> put<00:04:43.310> in<00:04:43.400> front

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
nicely with certain pedals put in front

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.439 
nicely with certain pedals put in front
of<00:04:43.699> them<00:04:43.849> so<00:04:44.030> you<00:04:44.090> can<00:04:44.210> get<00:04:44.449> in<00:04:44.570> more<00:04:44.960> tonal

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:46.449 
of them so you can get in more tonal

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:49.150 
of them so you can get in more tonal
ideas<00:04:47.449> from<00:04:47.750> it<00:04:47.930> and<00:04:48.110> tonal<00:04:48.500> sounds<00:04:48.860> from<00:04:48.979> it

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
ideas from it and tonal sounds from it

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.610 
ideas from it and tonal sounds from it
just<00:04:49.610> by<00:04:49.729> certain<00:04:50.300> pedals<00:04:50.930> that<00:04:51.169> to<00:04:51.289> boost

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
just by certain pedals that to boost

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.189 
just by certain pedals that to boost
even<00:04:52.039> more<00:04:52.729> into<00:04:53.000> the<00:04:53.090> front<00:04:53.270> of<00:04:53.389> it

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:54.199 
even more into the front of it

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:56.409 
even more into the front of it
valve<00:04:54.710> amps<00:04:55.039> react<00:04:55.370> very<00:04:55.580> very<00:04:55.820> nicely<00:04:56.060> to

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
valve amps react very very nicely to

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:59.469 
valve amps react very very nicely to
pedals<00:04:56.930> in<00:04:57.080> front<00:04:57.320> of<00:04:57.410> them<00:04:57.940> the<00:04:58.940> orange<00:04:59.090> Tiny

00:04:59.469 --> 00:04:59.479 
pedals in front of them the orange Tiny

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:02.860 
pedals in front of them the orange Tiny
Terror<00:04:59.720> great<00:05:00.650> amp
