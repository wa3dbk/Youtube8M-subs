minor pre-order bonuses I think this is
not<00:01:43.740> too<00:01:44.040> bad<00:01:44.310> as<00:01:44.520> pre-order<00:01:44.970> bonuses<00:01:45.360> go<00:01:45.740> as

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
not too bad as pre-order bonuses go as

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.069 
not too bad as pre-order bonuses go as
if<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.009> pre-order<00:01:47.520> you'll<00:01:48.210> get<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.780> nathan

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
if you pre-order you'll get a nathan

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.690
