00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.949
 and if we can go to the end 

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:11.949
 during the fighting 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:15.619
 I usually question 

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:20.400
 if the centuries several wounds 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.369
 the budget 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:31.419
 leclerc 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:33.740
 previously 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.910
 but he was thrown into the channel after the final victory 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.590
 debt relief 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.590
 lg was super hard at the abuse 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.130
 the craze for mother tel 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.390
 beyond 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.720
 the nights 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.720
 to do 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.290
 too strong and violent 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.960
 m 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.630
 little 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.900
 before addressing the issues 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.900
 he had been arrested at a fire 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.770
 what would follow 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.950
 that's what will look like 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.970
 even weeks 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.190
 as far as possible and so that's how it is 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:10.969
 in any case 

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:13.019
 more besides 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.019
 should we see in which he called he was called 

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:19.749
 while tokyo 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:21.539
 besides for me 

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:24.649
 during the race 

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:26.109
 30 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:28.979
 what do you think 

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:32.939
 I think that they are talking about all the rights that are cited there to 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:35.159
 believe 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:36.140
 note that their authors
