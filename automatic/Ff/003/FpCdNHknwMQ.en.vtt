00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
because we can't help ourselves we're

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.720 
because we can't help ourselves we're
about<00:00:40.320> motor<00:00:40.649> racing<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.250> we're<00:00:41.340> about<00:00:41.399> the

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
about motor racing and we're about the

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.970 
about motor racing and we're about the
passion<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.360> therefore<00:00:43.170> we<00:00:43.469> wanted<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.829> go

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
passion and therefore we wanted to go

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.400 
passion and therefore we wanted to go
and<00:00:44.129> race<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.399> car<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:44.850> two<00:00:45.600> if<00:00:45.840> we<00:00:46.079> didn't

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
and race to the car and two if we didn't

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.959 
and race to the car and two if we didn't
frankly<00:00:47.010> our<00:00:47.129> customers<00:00:47.550> were<00:00:47.670> going<00:00:47.879> out

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
frankly our customers were going out

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.819 
frankly our customers were going out
there<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.180> race<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.420> anyway<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:49.469> think<00:00:49.590> if

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
there and race it anyway so I think if

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.229 
there and race it anyway so I think if
it's<00:00:49.980> going<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.250> go<00:00:50.399> racing<00:00:50.789> we<00:00:50.910> feel<00:00:51.090> we

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
it's going to go racing we feel we

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.779 
it's going to go racing we feel we
should<00:00:51.270> control<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.719> game<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.739> this<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.129> gt3

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
should control the game so this is a gt3

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.970 
should control the game so this is a gt3
car<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.960> we're<00:00:55.110> going<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.350> develop<00:00:55.829> during

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.090 
the course of this year we'll race it

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
again because we can't help ourselves we

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
of the reforming of that team

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.890 
of the reforming of that team
to<00:05:09.289> Williams<00:05:09.830> up<00:05:10.190> being<00:05:10.970> more<00:05:11.180> respectable<00:05:11.750> in

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
to Williams up being more respectable in

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.540 
to Williams up being more respectable in
their<00:05:12.050> performance<00:05:12.560> why<00:05:12.949> was<00:05:13.159> Coughlin

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
their performance why was Coughlin

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.029 
their performance why was Coughlin
sacked<00:05:13.819> originally<00:05:14.470> with<00:05:15.470> you<00:05:15.620> a<00:05:15.680> bit<00:05:15.770> of<00:05:15.889> a

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:16.039 
sacked originally with you a bit of a

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:18.249 
sacked originally with you a bit of a
scapegoat<00:05:16.580> I<00:05:16.789> mean<00:05:16.970> I<00:05:17.060> wonder<00:05:17.750> why<00:05:17.870> he<00:05:17.900> was

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:18.259 
scapegoat I mean I wonder why he was

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:20.649 
scapegoat I mean I wonder why he was
specifically<00:05:18.949> fact<00:05:19.370> right<00:05:19.819> I<00:05:19.849> think<00:05:20.240> again

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:20.659 
specifically fact right I think again

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:22.450 
specifically fact right I think again
without<00:05:20.960> going<00:05:21.289> back<00:05:21.530> to<00:05:21.740> what<00:05:21.830> happened<00:05:22.129> over

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
without going back to what happened over

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.050 
without going back to what happened over

season<00:05:51.229> yeah<00:05:51.770> I<00:05:51.979> mean<00:05:52.159> I<00:05:52.280> find<00:05:52.699> it<00:05:52.909> a<00:05:53.120> bit

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:53.780 
season yeah I mean I find it a bit

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.260 
season yeah I mean I find it a bit
strange<00:05:54.319> to<00:05:54.500> sort<00:05:55.099> of<00:05:55.159> prioritize<00:05:55.639> your<00:05:55.909> your

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:56.270 
strange to sort of prioritize your your

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:57.700 
strange to sort of prioritize your your
drivers<00:05:56.629> in<00:05:56.750> the<00:05:56.780> team<00:05:56.990> I<00:05:57.139> don't<00:05:57.319> know<00:05:57.440> you<00:05:57.500> do

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
drivers in the team I don't know you do

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.420 
drivers in the team I don't know you do
oh<00:05:57.889> well<00:05:58.610> I<00:05:58.639> think<00:05:58.909> you<00:05:59.150> know<00:05:59.509> well<00:05:59.750> that<00:06:00.069> we<00:06:01.069> we

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:01.430 
oh well I think you know well that we we

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.670 
oh well I think you know well that we we
haven't<00:06:01.849> and<00:06:02.030> that's<00:06:02.419> been<00:06:03.319> our<00:06:03.440> policy

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 
haven't and that's been our policy

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.320 
haven't and that's been our policy
arguably<00:06:04.490> it's<00:06:04.669> cost<00:06:04.879> us<00:06:05.000> and<00:06:05.180> world

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.330 
arguably it's cost us and world

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.999 
arguably it's cost us and world
championships<00:06:05.780> and<00:06:06.139> we've<00:06:06.440> been<00:06:06.590> criticized

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:07.009 
championships and we've been criticized

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:09.189 
championships and we've been criticized
for<00:06:07.219> that<00:06:07.460> so<00:06:08.030> you<00:06:08.090> know<00:06:08.449> you're<00:06:08.780> damned<00:06:09.050> if

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:09.199 
for that so you know you're damned if

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:10.600 
for that so you know you're damned if
you<00:06:09.259> do<00:06:09.409> damned<00:06:09.650> if<00:06:09.740> you<00:06:09.800> don't<00:06:09.889> but<00:06:10.250> I<00:06:10.280> think

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
you do damned if you don't but I think

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.850 
you do damned if you don't but I think
our<00:06:10.789> view<00:06:11.060> is<00:06:11.090> that<00:06:11.300> going<00:06:11.599> into<00:06:11.900> formula<00:06:12.770> one

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:12.860 
our view is that going into formula one

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.769 
our view is that going into formula one
season<00:06:12.889> you<00:06:13.880> should<00:06:14.060> give<00:06:14.240> both<00:06:14.449> of<00:06:14.479> your

00:06:14.769 --> 00:06:14.779 
season you should give both of your

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:17.260 
season you should give both of your
drivers<00:06:15.289> equal<00:06:16.130> opportunity<00:06:16.849> to<00:06:17.000> win<00:06:17.150> that

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.270 
drivers equal opportunity to win that

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.909 
drivers equal opportunity to win that
World<00:06:17.509> Championship<00:06:18.080> and<00:06:18.259> that's<00:06:18.440> what<00:06:18.710> we've

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:18.919 
World Championship and that's what we've

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:22.089 
World Championship and that's what we've
always<00:06:19.130> done<00:06:19.430> I<00:06:19.940> think<00:06:20.509> that's<00:06:20.900> why<00:06:21.199> today<00:06:21.650> you

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:22.099 
always done I think that's why today you

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:23.469 
always done I think that's why today you
know<00:06:22.190> we've<00:06:22.340> got<00:06:22.490> two<00:06:22.610> world<00:06:22.849> champions<00:06:23.300> in

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:23.479 
know we've got two world champions in

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:24.879 
know we've got two world champions in
the<00:06:23.539> team<00:06:23.810> that's<00:06:23.930> why<00:06:24.139> I<00:06:24.169> think<00:06:24.590> they're

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:24.889 
the team that's why I think they're

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:26.439 
the team that's why I think they're
happy<00:06:25.159> to<00:06:25.279> be<00:06:25.400> in<00:06:25.550> our<00:06:25.729> team<00:06:25.940> or<00:06:26.060> they're<00:06:26.270> happy
