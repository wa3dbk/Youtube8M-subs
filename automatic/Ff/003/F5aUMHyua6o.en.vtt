00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:09.440
 let's take a trip to the world on 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.440
 the wall 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.490
 outwardly they seem immobile 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:22.060
 only using special filming 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.619
 You can because a lot of what is hidden for 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.090
 us for example 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.090
 plant movement 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.149
 here are familiar to us 7 and beans 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:44.230
 look like placed in the wet 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:47.579
 warm soil she wakes up begins 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.579
 move lead 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.820
 first give roots 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.470
 here came the stem 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:09.580
 remember what happens to the cells 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.580
 plants and mind growth 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.759
 their ears stern cell walls divide and 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.630
 increase in size 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:26.359
 accused of plant movement during 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:29.479
 growth is called growth is you 

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:33.229
 made sure the plants are constantly in 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:35.170
 motion signal grows the same 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:49.210
 rose flows 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:51.570
 hare and no spine usually grows down on 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.289
 here in the soil took update 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.289
 spine stretches to him 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:04.560
 and if I bring in the soil 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.560
 see how the movement has changed 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.650
 and what is comfortable with you movements degree 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.700
 he usually moves up towards 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.700
 sunshine 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:40.910
 and how would we have plants 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:45.250
 style has not changed in this case I just 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.250
 Torah leaves turn to light 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.150
 so apatite sun replaced 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:00.970
 ordinary lamp look 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.970
 raised and pulled their lamp light 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.709
 such a thirst for light plants instant 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.590
 repeatedly observed and such have themselves 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:21.819
 sunflower it is not without reason called 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:24.300
 flower sun much like and watch out 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.300
 for the sun 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:32.280
 some on the wall to reach for the light 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:37.069
 sorry, you need support 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.069
 this wall take a look and thin walls 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.740
 but 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.240
 look at how they do basic 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.240
 movements 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.150
 we met you were with species 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:29.910
 motions against the wall will proceed in such 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.910
 Movement passes all life since you are not
