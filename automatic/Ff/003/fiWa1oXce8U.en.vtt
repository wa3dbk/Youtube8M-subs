00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
generation tablet and its predecessor

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.040 
generation tablet and its predecessor
was<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:22.140> unit<00:00:22.800> AB<00:00:22.980> 3s<00:00:23.820> which<00:00:24.600> is<00:00:24.720> this<00:00:24.900> one

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
was the unit AB 3s which is this one

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.089 
was the unit AB 3s which is this one
right<00:00:25.199> here<00:00:25.640> and<00:00:27.320> so<00:00:28.320> what<00:00:28.470> I'll<00:00:28.560> be<00:00:28.590> doing<00:00:28.800> is

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
resolution is pretty good as well now

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.130 
resolution is pretty good as well now
it's<00:00:59.969> got<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.210> faster<00:01:00.960> arm<00:01:03.140> dual-core

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
it's got a faster arm dual-core

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.719 
it's got a faster arm dual-core
processor<00:01:04.799> as<00:01:04.979> well

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
processor as well

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.630 
processor as well
1.4<00:01:06.390> gigahertz<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:07.220> it's<00:01:08.220> got<00:01:08.400> an<00:01:08.520> internal

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
1.4 gigahertz and it's got an internal

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.179 
1.4 gigahertz and it's got an internal
memory<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.570> 8<00:01:10.350> gigabytes<00:01:11.159> arm<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.439> as<00:01:13.439> opposed

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
memory of 8 gigabytes arm and as opposed

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.190 
memory of 8 gigabytes arm and as opposed
to<00:01:14.280> four<00:01:14.490> gigabytes<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.390> earlier<00:01:15.780> one<00:01:15.960> and

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
to four gigabytes in the earlier one and

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.590 
to four gigabytes in the earlier one and
this<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.009> expandable<00:01:17.640> this<00:01:18.150> memory<00:01:18.509> is

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
this is expandable this memory is

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.350 
this is expandable this memory is
expandable<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:19.460> 40<00:01:20.460> gigs<00:01:21.740> using<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.970> micro<00:01:23.970> sd

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
expandable to 40 gigs using the micro sd

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.390 
expandable to 40 gigs using the micro sd
card<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:24.960> obviously<00:01:25.530> that's<00:01:25.680> not<00:01:25.830> included

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
card so obviously that's not included

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.800 
card so obviously that's not included
but<00:01:26.549> if<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:26.820> want<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.060> increase<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.630> memory

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
but if you want to increase the memory

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.609 
but if you want to increase the memory
of<00:01:28.049> this<00:01:29.000> of<00:01:30.000> this<00:01:30.180> tablet<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.630> sure<00:01:30.810> can<00:01:31.110> up

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
of this of this tablet you sure can up

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.980 
of this of this tablet you sure can up
to<00:01:31.770> 40<00:01:32.070> gigs<00:01:33.140> it's<00:01:34.140> also<00:01:34.380> got<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:35.990> rotating

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
to 40 gigs it's also got this rotating

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.499 
to 40 gigs it's also got this rotating
180<00:01:37.409> degree<00:01:37.890> rotating<00:01:38.520> camera<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.360> he

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
180 degree rotating camera so he

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.590 
180 degree rotating camera so he
essentially<00:01:40.079> can<00:01:40.500> have<00:01:41.460> it<00:01:41.610> front-facing<00:01:42.180> or

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
essentially can have it front-facing or

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.649 
essentially can have it front-facing or
rear-facing<00:01:43.079> which<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:43.920> pretty<00:01:44.100> good<00:01:44.310> as<00:01:44.430> well

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
rear-facing which is pretty good as well

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.590 
rear-facing which is pretty good as well
obviously<00:01:46.320> you<00:01:46.380> can<00:01:46.640> you<00:01:47.640> know<00:01:47.759> take<00:01:47.939> pictures

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
obviously you can you know take pictures

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.050 
obviously you can you know take pictures
in<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.200> create<00:01:49.619> videos<00:01:50.250> as<00:01:50.430> well<00:01:50.579> with<00:01:50.880> the

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
in and create videos as well with the

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.980 
in and create videos as well with the
over<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.540> camera<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.530> got<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.799> new<00:01:53.659> HDMI<00:01:54.659> port

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
over the camera it's got a new HDMI port

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.870 
over the camera it's got a new HDMI port
as<00:01:55.140> well<00:01:55.290> which<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.500> again<00:01:56.430> another<00:01:56.549> good

now when I was using this app right here

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:56.140 
now when I was using this app right here
which<00:04:53.960> is<00:04:53.990> the<00:04:54.259> art<00:04:54.560> studio<00:04:54.979> and<00:04:55.849> one<00:04:56.029> of<00:04:56.090> the

things that I've found is while using

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.550 
things that I've found is while using
this<00:04:58.879> tireless<00:04:59.449> especially<00:05:00.169> for<00:05:00.289> drawing

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
this tireless especially for drawing

this tireless especially for drawing
lines<00:05:01.120> and<00:05:02.120> then<00:05:02.330> find<00:05:02.539> it<00:05:02.629> very<00:05:02.810> responsive<00:05:03.409> I

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
lines and then find it very responsive I

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.260 
lines and then find it very responsive I
found<00:05:03.889> it<00:05:04.009> much<00:05:04.219> easier<00:05:04.490> to<00:05:04.610> just<00:05:05.060> use<00:05:05.120> a

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
found it much easier to just use a

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.399 
found it much easier to just use a
finger<00:05:06.370> to<00:05:07.370> you<00:05:07.939> know<00:05:08.060> to<00:05:08.120> draw<00:05:08.479> and<00:05:08.779> use<00:05:09.259> that

00:05:09.399 --> 00:05:09.409 
finger to you know to draw and use that

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:12.309 
finger to you know to draw and use that
app<00:05:09.590> so<00:05:10.520> that<00:05:10.879> was<00:05:11.029> one<00:05:11.180> thing<00:05:11.210> and<00:05:11.629> again<00:05:11.930> for

00:05:12.309 --> 00:05:12.319 
app so that was one thing and again for

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:14.920 
app so that was one thing and again for
the<00:05:12.409> picture<00:05:12.740> quality<00:05:13.060> off<00:05:14.060> the<00:05:14.300> camera<00:05:14.779> you

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:16.729

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:20.110 
know don't expect it to be like a super
high<00:05:17.330> quality<00:05:18.099> pictures<00:05:19.099> but<00:05:19.339> you<00:05:19.729> know<00:05:19.849> it's
