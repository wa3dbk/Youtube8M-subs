00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.710 

now<00:02:27.459> I've<00:02:27.610> already<00:02:27.760> also<00:02:28.090> picked<00:02:28.269> up<00:02:28.360> series

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
now I've already also picked up series

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.390 
now I've already also picked up series
four<00:02:29.019> I'm<00:02:29.170> gonna<00:02:29.260> be<00:02:29.440> looking<00:02:29.530> those<00:02:29.830> as<00:02:30.069> well

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
four I'm gonna be looking those as well

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.520 
four I'm gonna be looking those as well
and<00:02:30.640> I<00:02:31.330> don't<00:02:31.420> know<00:02:31.569> I'm<00:02:32.019> looking<00:02:32.319> at<00:02:32.410> the

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
and I don't know I'm looking at the

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.470 
and I don't know I'm looking at the
package<00:02:33.069> while<00:02:33.700> there<00:02:33.910> are<00:02:34.030> a<00:02:34.060> couple<00:02:34.299> of

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
package while there are a couple of

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.630 
package while there are a couple of
really<00:02:34.599> cool<00:02:34.690> ones<00:02:35.049> on<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:35.379> on<00:02:35.500> here

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
really cool ones on the on here

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.970 
really cool ones on the on here
I<00:02:36.670> think<00:02:37.209> series<00:02:37.569> four<00:02:37.840> has<00:02:38.019> a<00:02:38.049> stronger<00:02:38.590> wave

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
I think series four has a stronger wave

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.610 
I think series four has a stronger wave
on<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:39.640> same<00:02:39.910> and<00:02:40.209> the<00:02:40.870> first<00:02:41.200> package

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
on the same and the first package

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.460 
on the same and the first package
reveals<00:02:42.010> to<00:02:42.280> us<00:02:42.870> kyle<00:02:43.870> rayner

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
reveals to us kyle rayner

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.690
