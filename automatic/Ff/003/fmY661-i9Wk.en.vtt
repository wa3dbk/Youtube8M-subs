flying<00:01:01.300> type<00:01:01.690> a<00:01:02.910> electric<00:01:03.910> flying<00:01:04.180> type<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:06.430> a

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
flying type a electric flying type and a

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.899 
flying type a electric flying type and a
nice<00:01:07.600> flying<00:01:08.020> type<00:01:08.380> wonder<00:01:09.310> who<00:01:09.429> those<00:01:09.579> could

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
nice flying type wonder who those could

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:17.999 
nice flying type wonder who those could
be<00:01:12.450> three<00:01:13.450> two<00:01:14.280> one<00:01:16.319> so<00:01:17.319> you<00:01:17.380> would<00:01:17.829> probably

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
be three two one so you would probably

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:21.870 
be three two one so you would probably
expect<00:01:18.219> I<00:01:18.880> mean<00:01:19.179> there<00:01:19.829> wasn't<00:01:20.829> 62<00:01:21.459> or<00:01:21.490> 63

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
expect I mean there wasn't 62 or 63

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.419 
expect I mean there wasn't 62 or 63
Pokemon<00:01:22.420> status<00:01:22.959> you<00:01:23.649> probably<00:01:23.950> expect<00:01:24.249> this

00:01:24.419 --> 00:01:24.429 
Pokemon status you probably expect this

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:27.149 
Pokemon status you probably expect this
to<00:01:24.729> be<00:01:24.759> the<00:01:25.299> how<00:01:25.959> this<00:01:26.109> one<00:01:26.380> so<00:01:26.590> far

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
to be the how this one so far

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.539 
to be the how this one so far
and<00:01:28.090> I<00:01:28.569> really<00:01:28.929> didn't<00:01:29.170> find<00:01:29.289> this<00:01:29.380> case<00:01:29.679> it's

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
and I really didn't find this case it's

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:32.760 
and I really didn't find this case it's
probably<00:01:30.929> Pokemon<00:01:31.929> wise<00:01:32.139> probably<00:01:32.679> the

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
probably Pokemon wise probably the

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.769 
probably Pokemon wise probably the
hardest<00:01:33.130> but<00:01:34.109> with<00:01:35.109> Alakazam<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:37.299> this

00:01:37.769 --> 00:01:37.779 
hardest but with Alakazam this this

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:41.870 
hardest but with Alakazam this this
better<00:01:38.590> rails<00:01:38.950> pretty<00:01:39.909> easy<00:01:40.359> as<00:01:40.749> you<00:01:40.990> can<00:01:41.049> see

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
better rails pretty easy as you can see

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.730 
better rails pretty easy as you can see
now<00:01:42.880> Kazaam<00:01:43.270> just<00:01:43.539> took<00:01:43.659> out<00:01:43.869> almost<00:01:44.200> 20

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
now Kazaam just took out almost 20

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.219 
now Kazaam just took out almost 20
pokemon<00:01:46.229> now<00:01:47.229> at<00:01:47.439> least<00:01:47.590> 24<00:01:48.099> pokemon<00:01:48.909> and<00:01:49.869> he

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
pokemon now at least 24 pokemon and he

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.309 
pokemon now at least 24 pokemon and he
hasn't<00:01:50.439> taken<00:01:50.529> any<00:01:50.770> damage<00:01:51.189> at<00:01:51.520> all<00:01:51.669> because

00:01:52.309 --> 00:01:52.319 
hasn't taken any damage at all because

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:56.669 
hasn't taken any damage at all because
psycho<00:01:53.319> cutter<00:01:53.679> is<00:01:53.950> probably<00:01:55.139> the<00:01:56.139> best<00:01:56.409> move

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
psycho cutter is probably the best move

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:57.570 
psycho cutter is probably the best move
I've<00:01:56.859> seen<00:01:57.069> so<00:01:57.279> far

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:04.570 
so let's see what this is

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:17.890 
so let's see what this is
a<00:06:05.880> new<00:06:06.880> battle<00:06:07.060> will<00:06:07.360> begin

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:17.900 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:23.010

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.020 
oh and we're back back to another C rank

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.870 
oh and we're back back to another C rank
but<00:06:24.020> as<00:06:24.200> you<00:06:24.320> probably<00:06:24.530> expected<00:06:25.250> this<00:06:25.430> C<00:06:25.670> rank

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:25.880 
but as you probably expected this C rank

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.180 
but as you probably expected this C rank
is<00:06:26.090> definitely<00:06:26.600> different<00:06:26.990> different<00:06:27.800> than

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.190 
is definitely different different than

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:32.230 
is definitely different different than
the<00:06:28.670> the<00:06:29.180> other<00:06:29.360> one<00:06:30.610> in<00:06:31.610> the<00:06:31.700> next<00:06:32.000> video

the the other one in the next video
you'll<00:06:32.480> see<00:06:33.160> exactly<00:06:34.160> why<00:06:34.490> it's<00:06:34.700> different<00:06:34.910> I

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:35.330 
you'll see exactly why it's different I

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.260 
you'll see exactly why it's different I
mean<00:06:35.630> you<00:06:35.780> probably<00:06:35.990> already<00:06:36.350> know<00:06:36.620> I<00:06:36.890> know<00:06:37.270> um
