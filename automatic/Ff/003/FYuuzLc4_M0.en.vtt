00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.960 
the side this is nice to deal with the
ads<00:03:26.400> which<00:03:26.820> we'll<00:03:27.060> talk<00:03:27.090> about<00:03:27.300> in<00:03:27.540> a<00:03:27.720> moment

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
ads which we'll talk about in a moment

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.370 
ads which we'll talk about in a moment
the<00:03:29.970> mini-boss<00:03:30.239> thing<00:03:30.540> occurs<00:03:30.840> about<00:03:31.080> every

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
the mini-boss thing occurs about every

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.590 
the mini-boss thing occurs about every
90<00:03:31.739> seconds<00:03:32.070> or<00:03:32.220> so<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:33.030> only<00:03:33.150> reason<00:03:33.450> this

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
90 seconds or so the only reason this

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.060 
90 seconds or so the only reason this
matters<00:03:33.900> is<00:03:34.260> that<00:03:34.320> you<00:03:34.590> have<00:03:34.770> to<00:03:34.920> actually

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
matters is that you have to actually

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.400 
matters is that you have to actually
clear<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:36.090> mini-boss<00:03:36.360> and<00:03:36.690> be<00:03:36.870> back<00:03:37.050> in<00:03:37.080> the

can take place of the other tank now the

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.340 
can take place of the other tank now the
boss<00:04:05.400> will<00:04:05.610> also<00:04:05.910> periodically<00:04:06.480> spawn<00:04:06.810> ads<00:04:07.110> in

boss will also periodically spawn ads in

boss will also periodically spawn ads in
the<00:04:07.440> area<00:04:07.709> that<00:04:07.890> isn't<00:04:08.130> protected<00:04:08.730> by<00:04:08.850> the

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
the area that isn't protected by the

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.420 
the area that isn't protected by the
light<00:04:09.180> these<00:04:09.870> ads<00:04:10.200> will<00:04:10.470> bombard<00:04:10.739> your<00:04:11.220> raid

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
light these ads will bombard your raid

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.910 
light these ads will bombard your raid
doing<00:04:11.880> a<00:04:11.970> decent<00:04:12.150> chunk<00:04:12.540> of<00:04:12.750> damage<00:04:13.050> however

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
doing a decent chunk of damage however

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.979 
doing a decent chunk of damage however
they<00:04:14.220> can't<00:04:14.519> be<00:04:14.610> hurt<00:04:14.820> at<00:04:15.000> all<00:04:15.330> from<00:04:15.630> the<00:04:15.780> front

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
they can't be hurt at all from the front

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.990 
they can't be hurt at all from the front
so<00:04:16.620> the<00:04:16.650> only<00:04:16.859> way<00:04:17.040> to<00:04:17.100> actually<00:04:17.310> kill<00:04:17.669> them<00:04:17.850> is

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
so the only way to actually kill them is

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.490 
so the only way to actually kill them is
to<00:04:18.209> run<00:04:18.390> out<00:04:18.600> of<00:04:18.630> the<00:04:18.810> safety<00:04:19.019> of<00:04:19.169> the<00:04:19.320> light

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
to run out of the safety of the light

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.130 
to run out of the safety of the light
and<00:04:19.709> attack<00:04:20.459> them<00:04:20.669> from<00:04:20.700> behind<00:04:20.910> this<00:04:21.900> means

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
and attack them from behind this means

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.690 
and attack them from behind this means
absolutely<00:04:22.530> nothing<00:04:22.590> to<00:04:23.160> you<00:04:23.280> of<00:04:23.370> the<00:04:23.460> tank

00:06:43.429 --> 00:06:45.549 
move they actually do this in LFR and I
didn't<00:06:43.699> cover<00:06:43.849> it<00:06:44.029> but<00:06:44.719> most<00:06:45.199> of<00:06:45.289> the<00:06:45.409> time

00:06:45.549 --> 00:06:45.559 
didn't cover it but most of the time

00:06:45.559 --> 00:06:46.989 
didn't cover it but most of the time
they<00:06:45.739> die<00:06:45.889> before<00:06:46.159> they<00:06:46.399> get<00:06:46.519> to<00:06:46.639> it<00:06:46.729> and<00:06:46.849> way

00:06:46.989 --> 00:06:46.999 
they die before they get to it and way

00:06:46.999 --> 00:06:48.369 
they die before they get to it and way
in<00:06:47.119> hella<00:06:47.239> far<00:06:47.449> so<00:06:47.659> I<00:06:47.689> didn't<00:06:47.959> really<00:06:47.989> cover<00:06:48.259> it

00:06:48.369 --> 00:06:48.379 
in hella far so I didn't really cover it

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:50.139 
in hella far so I didn't really cover it
but<00:06:48.499> you<00:06:48.649> will<00:06:48.800> have<00:06:48.949> to<00:06:49.009> actually<00:06:49.189> line<00:06:50.119> up

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:50.149 
but you will have to actually line up

00:06:50.149 --> 00:06:52.409 
but you will have to actually line up
site<00:06:50.569> it<00:06:50.749> and<00:06:50.929> hide<00:06:51.199> behind<00:06:51.379> pillars<00:06:51.769> tanks

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:52.419 
site it and hide behind pillars tanks

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:54.579 
site it and hide behind pillars tanks
but<00:06:53.419> even<00:06:53.599> the<00:06:53.779> strategy<00:06:54.110> for<00:06:54.259> takes<00:06:54.439> is<00:06:54.559> the

00:06:54.579 --> 00:06:54.589 
but even the strategy for takes is the

00:06:54.589 --> 00:06:56.829 
but even the strategy for takes is the
same<00:06:54.860> because<00:06:55.219> you<00:06:55.849> have<00:06:56.179> to<00:06:56.300> keep<00:06:56.419> tanking

00:06:56.829 --> 00:06:56.839 
same because you have to keep tanking

00:06:56.839 --> 00:06:58.329 
same because you have to keep tanking
the<00:06:56.869> boss<00:06:57.080> and<00:06:57.349> grabbing<00:06:57.739> the<00:06:57.800> little<00:06:58.009> spheres

00:06:58.329 --> 00:06:58.339 
the boss and grabbing the little spheres

00:06:58.339 --> 00:07:02.229 
the boss and grabbing the little spheres
that<00:06:58.459> are<00:06:58.699> hanging<00:06:58.819> around<00:06:59.860> yes<00:07:00.860> so<00:07:01.219> it's<00:07:01.969> just

that are hanging around yes so it's just

00:07:02.239 --> 00:07:03.759 
that are hanging around yes so it's just
a<00:07:02.330> simple<00:07:02.569> matter<00:07:02.689> of<00:07:02.809> execution<00:07:03.229> and<00:07:03.499> tanks

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:03.769
