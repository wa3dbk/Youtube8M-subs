00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:19.820
 Pass the foot in the coffin 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:23.090
 Center the front part of the brow and put the string sideways 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.760

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.340
 Cross 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.630
 As it is the day 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.630
 I will come in advance 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.440

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.490
 Take it to the left side 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:45.600
 The day on the left is also folded 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:45.600
 Pull the horizontal so as to overlap at that time the right of the string 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.940
 Turn now back 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.940

 It then appeal brought before the string 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.450

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.890

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.890
 Pull up 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.770
 Fold another string to the right 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.100
 I will tell you the day you pulled it up 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.600
 However , I will pass the day in a folded string 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.610
 Pull the left and right strings tightly 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.420

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.420
 Wrap around the front strap 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.890
 Pimp 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:25.860
 If you are left for a long time 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.860
 I will sit back and kill 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:34.330

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:56.130
 I'll make a belly tie in front 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.130
 This mounting of the gears version is the end 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.760
 The mask is 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.880
 Match your own river 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.890

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.879
 I wrap it on my face 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:18.190

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:50.400
 Get off the excess to fit your wrist 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:52.120
 And secure it by winding a string 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:56.310

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.310
