tour<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.440> because<00:01:34.770> I've<00:01:35.070> actually<00:01:35.369> never

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
tour of it because I've actually never

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.449 
tour of it because I've actually never
seen<00:01:36.270> one<00:01:36.509> before<00:01:36.569> it's<00:01:37.560> got<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.920> usual<00:01:38.429> kind

00:01:38.449 --> 00:01:38.459 
seen one before it's got the usual kind

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:40.699 
seen one before it's got the usual kind
of<00:01:38.819> enermax<00:01:39.360> look<00:01:39.720> so<00:01:39.899> it<00:01:39.990> does<00:01:40.140> have<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.440> bit<00:01:40.679> of

00:01:40.699 --> 00:01:40.709 
of enermax look so it does have a bit of

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:43.309 
of enermax look so it does have a bit of
a<00:01:40.950> overall<00:01:41.670> plastic<00:01:42.479> front<00:01:42.720> bezel<00:01:42.959> but<00:01:43.170> I

00:01:43.309 --> 00:01:43.319 
a overall plastic front bezel but I

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:45.380 
a overall plastic front bezel but I
think<00:01:43.590> actually<00:01:43.950> managed<00:01:44.580> to<00:01:44.670> do<00:01:44.910> it<00:01:45.060> pretty

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
think actually managed to do it pretty

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.600 
think actually managed to do it pretty
darn<00:01:45.810> tastefully<00:01:46.410> here<00:01:46.649> there's<00:01:47.130> three<00:01:47.310> five

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
darn tastefully here there's three five

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.609 
darn tastefully here there's three five
and<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.849> quarter<00:01:48.030> inch<00:01:48.330> of<00:01:48.509> vented<00:01:48.959> bays<00:01:49.229> at<00:01:49.470> the

00:01:52.699 --> 00:01:52.709 
front as well as an open vent also in

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:55.790 
front as well as an open vent also in
the<00:01:52.830> front<00:01:53.099> oh<00:01:53.869> well<00:01:54.869> there<00:01:55.110> was<00:01:55.289> the<00:01:55.470> side

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
the front oh well there was the side

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.919 
the front oh well there was the side
panel<00:01:56.250> protective<00:01:56.849> window<00:01:57.270> covering<00:01:57.750> that

was<00:01:58.170> kind<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.590> like<00:01:58.880> you<00:01:59.880> know<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:01.550> preview<00:02:02.550> of

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
was kind of like you know a preview of

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.820 
was kind of like you know a preview of
what's<00:02:03.179> to<00:02:03.300> come<00:02:03.630> because<00:02:04.170> over<00:02:04.590> here

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
what's to come because over here

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.620 
what's to come because over here
actually<00:02:04.979> let's<00:02:05.369> finish<00:02:05.550> with<00:02:05.819> the<00:02:06.030> front<00:02:06.450> i/o

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
actually let's finish with the front i/o

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.260 
actually let's finish with the front i/o
first<00:02:07.110> so<00:02:07.830> front<00:02:08.190> io<00:02:08.340> is<00:02:08.489> taken<00:02:08.819> care<00:02:08.849> of<00:02:09.030> there

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
first so front io is taken care of there

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.910 
first so front io is taken care of there
we<00:02:09.330> go<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.539> guys<00:02:09.720> better<00:02:10.020> angle<00:02:10.259> that<00:02:10.380> to<00:02:10.619> USB

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
we go you guys better angle that to USB

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.010

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.520 
box the GPU is where a lot of the budget
went<00:03:54.150> and<00:03:54.390> that<00:03:54.480> makes<00:03:54.720> sense<00:03:55.019> for<00:03:55.230> a<00:03:55.290> gaming

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
went and that makes sense for a gaming

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.539 
went and that makes sense for a gaming
oriented<00:03:56.310> build<00:03:56.549> and<00:03:56.790> it's<00:03:57.150> a<00:03:57.299> radeon<00:03:57.630> r9<00:03:58.549> 290

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
oriented build and it's a radeon r9 290

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.460 
oriented build and it's a radeon r9 290
so<00:03:59.700> that's<00:03:59.880> a<00:03:59.970> four<00:04:00.269> gig<00:04:00.600> card<00:04:00.959> so<00:04:01.290> if<00:04:01.380> you

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
so that's a four gig card so if you

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.960 
so that's a four gig card so if you
wanted<00:04:01.709> to<00:04:01.799> run<00:04:01.920> high<00:04:02.100> resolution<00:04:02.760> or

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
whatever else well more memory is more

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:06.979

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
better remember more memory doesn't

you even want your OS some key

you<00:04:37.650> actually<00:04:38.220> need<00:04:38.669> a<00:04:38.700> bit<00:04:38.910> of<00:04:39.000> a<00:04:39.060> higher

you actually need a bit of a higher

you actually need a bit of a higher
capacity<00:04:40.560> SSD<00:04:41.040> than<00:04:41.250> you<00:04:41.370> used<00:04:41.580> to<00:04:41.700> so<00:04:42.210> that's

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
capacity SSD than you used to so that's

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.659 
capacity SSD than you used to so that's
where<00:04:42.600> the<00:04:42.720> 240<00:04:43.440> gig<00:04:43.620> SSD<00:04:43.890> comes<00:04:44.280> from<00:04:44.460> however

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669 
where the 240 gig SSD comes from however

where the 240 gig SSD comes from however
it's<00:04:45.479> still<00:04:45.600> useful<00:04:45.930> to<00:04:46.200> have<00:04:46.320> a<00:04:46.380> spillover

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
it's still useful to have a spillover

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.400 
it's still useful to have a spillover
mechanical<00:04:47.760> drive<00:04:47.970> so<00:04:48.180> there<00:04:48.330> is<00:04:48.600> a<00:04:48.990> one

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
mechanical drive so there is a one

with Windows 8.1 64bit out of the box
there<00:05:02.730> are<00:05:02.910> a<00:05:02.940> couple<00:05:03.180> unique<00:05:03.600> features<00:05:03.960> in

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
there are a couple unique features in

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.510 
there are a couple unique features in
this<00:05:04.230> case<00:05:04.440> so<00:05:04.650> you've<00:05:04.770> got<00:05:04.890> a<00:05:04.920> lot<00:05:05.160> of<00:05:05.190> drive

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
this case so you've got a lot of drive

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.070 
this case so you've got a lot of drive
expansion<00:05:05.850> this<00:05:06.180> is<00:05:06.300> kind<00:05:06.510> of<00:05:06.570> cool<00:05:06.780> here<00:05:07.050> in

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
expansion this is kind of cool here in

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.360 
expansion this is kind of cool here in
the<00:05:07.230> front<00:05:07.410> where<00:05:07.590> you<00:05:07.620> can<00:05:07.710> actually<00:05:07.950> move

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
the front where you can actually move

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.880 
the front where you can actually move
this<00:05:09.060> rail<00:05:09.450> over<00:05:09.870> to<00:05:10.020> the<00:05:10.200> left<00:05:10.410> so<00:05:10.620> you<00:05:10.680> can

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
this rail over to the left so you can

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.800 
this rail over to the left so you can
enable<00:05:11.070> either<00:05:11.460> for<00:05:11.940> two<00:05:12.090> and<00:05:12.150> a<00:05:12.240> half<00:05:12.270> inch<00:05:12.630> or
