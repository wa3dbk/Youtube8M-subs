marker I've got a couple different nib

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.390 
marker I've got a couple different nib
sizes<00:00:07.680> here<00:00:07.859> we've<00:00:08.010> got<00:00:08.130> the<00:00:08.250> eight

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
sizes here we've got the eight

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.000 
sizes here we've got the eight
millimeter<00:00:08.910> round<00:00:09.300> ten<00:00:10.019> millimeter<00:00:10.440> chisel

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
millimeter round ten millimeter chisel

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.039 
millimeter round ten millimeter chisel
and<00:00:11.130> then<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.759> 15<00:00:12.059> millimeter<00:00:12.300> standard

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
and then the 15 millimeter standard

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.620 
and then the 15 millimeter standard
broad<00:00:13.860> tip<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.309> so<00:00:14.880> this<00:00:15.179> is<00:00:15.299> an<00:00:15.420> alcohol

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630

up we've got the blue cyan and we'll
just<00:00:48.300> be<00:00:48.450> doing<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.780> majority<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:49.200> this<00:00:49.320> on

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530

just be doing the majority of this on
the<00:00:49.680> painted<00:00:49.980> surface<00:00:50.309> but<00:00:50.520> then<00:00:50.640> we'll<00:00:50.789> get

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
the painted surface but then we'll get

00:00:50.879 --> 00:01:00.340 
the painted surface but then we'll get
into<00:00:51.199> some<00:00:52.199> different<00:00:52.500> variations<00:00:52.890> later<00:00:53.460> on

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350

so<00:01:11.219> the<00:01:11.340> eight<00:01:11.429> millimeter<00:01:11.820> nib<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.359> nice

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
so the eight millimeter nib is a nice

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.139 
so the eight millimeter nib is a nice
kind<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:12.960> flat<00:01:13.289> tip<00:01:13.859> you<00:01:14.609> can<00:01:14.729> really<00:01:14.939> get<00:01:15.090> some

all right so now we're going to be
testing<00:03:32.970> it<00:03:33.090> on<00:03:33.120> some<00:03:33.329> varied<00:03:33.659> surfaces<00:03:34.110> I'm

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
testing it on some varied surfaces I'm

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.449 
testing it on some varied surfaces I'm
just<00:03:34.409> going<00:03:34.530> to<00:03:34.560> be<00:03:34.680> using<00:03:34.829> the<00:03:35.040> three<00:03:35.250> primary

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
just going to be using the three primary

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.759 
just going to be using the three primary
colors<00:03:35.700> here<00:03:36.180> to<00:03:36.750> show<00:03:37.049> you<00:03:37.110> one<00:03:37.530> the

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
colors here to show you one the

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.350 
colors here to show you one the
difference<00:03:38.189> so<00:03:38.340> we<00:03:38.430> got<00:03:38.579> an<00:03:38.700> eight<00:03:38.849> to<00:03:38.970> ten<00:03:39.209> and

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
difference so we got an eight to ten and

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.449 
difference so we got an eight to ten and
a<00:03:39.420> fifteen<00:03:39.930> show<00:03:40.620> you<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.829> flow<00:03:41.010> on<00:03:41.159> each<00:03:41.310> of

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
a fifteen show you the flow on each of

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:42.830 
a fifteen show you the flow on each of
them<00:03:41.579> as<00:03:41.760> well<00:03:41.970> as<00:03:42.000> how<00:03:42.180> they<00:03:42.329> set<00:03:42.510> into<00:03:42.750> the

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
them as well as how they set into the

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.509 
them as well as how they set into the
surface<00:03:43.230> how<00:03:43.439> they<00:03:43.590> streak<00:03:43.860> on<00:03:43.980> like<00:03:44.159> a<00:03:44.189> metal

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
surface how they streak on like a metal

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.490 
surface how they streak on like a metal
surface<00:03:44.670> and<00:03:45.360> so<00:03:45.510> let's<00:03:45.659> get<00:03:45.780> into<00:03:45.989> it<00:03:46.110> so

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
surface and so let's get into it so

00:03:46.500 --> 00:04:25.460 
surface and so let's get into it so
first<00:03:46.530> up<00:03:46.860> we'll<00:03:47.010> do<00:03:47.129> some<00:03:47.310> red<00:03:47.519> on<00:03:47.549> cardboard

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:53.820 

now<00:04:26.470> we've<00:04:26.620> got<00:04:26.740> some<00:04:26.920> slick<00:04:27.220> plastic<00:04:52.830> and

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
now we've got some slick plastic and

00:04:53.830 --> 00:05:17.189 
now we've got some slick plastic and
lastly<00:04:54.700> some<00:04:55.000> slick<00:04:55.270> metal

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:17.199 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:18.929 

all<00:05:18.009> right<00:05:18.159> check<00:05:18.310> it<00:05:18.400> out<00:05:18.490> so<00:05:18.610> we've<00:05:18.699> just

00:05:18.929 --> 00:05:18.939 
all right check it out so we've just

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:20.909 
all right check it out so we've just
completed<00:05:19.180> the<00:05:19.509> first<00:05:19.689> preliminary<00:05:20.020> test<00:05:20.680> of

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:20.919 
completed the first preliminary test of

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:22.080 
completed the first preliminary test of
all<00:05:21.099> of<00:05:21.219> them<00:05:21.370> on<00:05:21.520> a<00:05:21.550> bunch<00:05:21.759> of<00:05:21.819> different

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
all of them on a bunch of different

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:23.730 
all of them on a bunch of different
surfaces<00:05:22.240> now<00:05:23.020> we're<00:05:23.139> going<00:05:23.229> to<00:05:23.289> do<00:05:23.439> a<00:05:23.469> buff

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
surfaces now we're going to do a buff

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.070 
surfaces now we're going to do a buff
test<00:05:24.009> on<00:05:24.249> the<00:05:24.370> painted<00:05:24.939> surface<00:05:25.300> the<00:05:25.779> rest<00:05:25.960> of

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
test on the painted surface the rest of

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.489 
test on the painted surface the rest of
them

00:05:26.489 --> 00:05:26.499 
them

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:29.040 
them
it'll<00:05:26.949> probably<00:05:27.099> emulate<00:05:27.909> the<00:05:28.090> same<00:05:28.270> thing<00:05:28.539> so

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
it'll probably emulate the same thing so

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.589 
it'll probably emulate the same thing so
I'm<00:05:29.319> going<00:05:29.439> to<00:05:29.469> pick<00:05:29.620> the<00:05:29.770> red<00:05:30.009> in<00:05:30.449> the<00:05:31.449> 8

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:31.599 
I'm going to pick the red in the 8

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:33.269 
I'm going to pick the red in the 8
millimeter<00:05:32.020> to<00:05:32.229> go<00:05:32.349> off<00:05:32.499> of<00:05:32.529> as<00:05:32.860> that's<00:05:33.039> pretty

00:05:33.269 --> 00:05:33.279 
millimeter to go off of as that's pretty

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:35.159 
millimeter to go off of as that's pretty
much<00:05:33.400> the<00:05:33.550> most<00:05:33.909> like<00:05:34.210> middle<00:05:34.509> tone<00:05:34.749> out<00:05:35.020> of

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:35.169 
much the most like middle tone out of

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:36.689 
much the most like middle tone out of
all<00:05:35.289> of<00:05:35.439> them<00:05:35.590> you<00:05:35.770> got<00:05:36.129> the<00:05:36.219> lighter<00:05:36.460> ones

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:36.699 
all of them you got the lighter ones

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:38.489 
all of them you got the lighter ones
like<00:05:36.939> the<00:05:37.029> yellow<00:05:37.240> and<00:05:37.419> the<00:05:37.509> green<00:05:37.539> the<00:05:38.080> cyan

00:05:38.489 --> 00:05:38.499 
like the yellow and the green the cyan

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:40.019 
like the yellow and the green the cyan
then<00:05:38.979> you<00:05:39.069> get<00:05:39.189> the<00:05:39.310> darker<00:05:39.669> like<00:05:39.879> the

00:05:40.019 --> 00:05:40.029 
then you get the darker like the

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:41.339 
then you get the darker like the
straight-up<00:05:40.240> blue<00:05:40.539> the<00:05:40.779> violet<00:05:41.169> and<00:05:41.259> the

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:41.349 
straight-up blue the violet and the

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:43.230 
straight-up blue the violet and the
black<00:05:41.590> so<00:05:42.219> I<00:05:42.249> figured<00:05:42.639> that<00:05:42.759> would<00:05:42.879> be<00:05:42.909> a<00:05:42.999> good

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
black so I figured that would be a good

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.760 
black so I figured that would be a good
one<00:05:43.419> and<00:05:43.629> I've<00:05:44.110> already<00:05:44.319> kind<00:05:44.439> of<00:05:44.560> done<00:05:44.740> a

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
one and I've already kind of done a

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.610 
one and I've already kind of done a
preliminary<00:05:45.039> test<00:05:45.669> of<00:05:45.999> the<00:05:46.659> buff<00:05:47.110> test<00:05:47.409> and

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
preliminary test of the buff test and

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.290 
preliminary test of the buff test and
it's<00:05:47.949> going<00:05:48.039> to<00:05:48.099> take<00:05:48.310> a<00:05:48.340> lot<00:05:48.669> of<00:05:48.699> folks<00:05:49.029> I<00:05:49.150> can

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
it's going to take a lot of folks I can

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.760 
it's going to take a lot of folks I can
tell<00:05:49.449> you<00:05:49.509> that<00:05:49.629> much<00:05:49.839> so<00:05:50.169> let's<00:05:50.560> just<00:05:50.710> jump

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
tell you that much so let's just jump

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.040 
tell you that much so let's just jump
into<00:05:51.039> it<00:05:51.310> and<00:05:51.460> see<00:05:51.879> how<00:05:51.969> how<00:05:52.509> many<00:05:52.659> coats<00:05:52.900> it

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 
into it and see how how many coats it

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:59.600 
into it and see how how many coats it
takes<00:05:53.229> to<00:05:53.439> kind<00:05:53.919> of<00:05:53.979> really<00:05:54.310> cover<00:05:54.610> up<00:05:54.819> the<00:05:55.110> tag

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:10.230 

still

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:19.410 

steady

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:19.420 

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.760 

so<00:06:20.420> I've<00:06:20.540> gone<00:06:20.660> ahead<00:06:20.720> and<00:06:20.930> added<00:06:21.200> a<00:06:21.500> few<00:06:21.710> more

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:21.770 
so I've gone ahead and added a few more

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.340 
so I've gone ahead and added a few more
coats<00:06:22.160> after<00:06:22.640> filming<00:06:23.090> and<00:06:23.360> this<00:06:23.960> is<00:06:24.140> the

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:24.350 
coats after filming and this is the

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:26.320 
coats after filming and this is the
final<00:06:25.100> product<00:06:25.340> here<00:06:25.640> you<00:06:25.790> can<00:06:25.910> see<00:06:26.090> I<00:06:26.120> went

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.330 
final product here you can see I went

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.300 
final product here you can see I went
over<00:06:26.570> all<00:06:26.720> the<00:06:26.870> colors<00:06:27.170> actually<00:06:27.380> just<00:06:27.890> so<00:06:28.070> I

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:28.310 
over all the colors actually just so I

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.430 
over all the colors actually just so I
had<00:06:28.580> to<00:06:28.700> eventually<00:06:29.240> so<00:06:29.420> might<00:06:29.600> as<00:06:29.660> well<00:06:29.690> God

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 
had to eventually so might as well God

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.220 
had to eventually so might as well God
in<00:06:30.650> um<00:06:30.740> video<00:06:31.490> so<00:06:32.150> this<00:06:32.600> is<00:06:32.720> about<00:06:32.840> the<00:06:32.990> extent

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:33.230 
in um video so this is about the extent

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.800 
in um video so this is about the extent
I'd<00:06:33.590> go<00:06:33.830> for<00:06:34.040> for<00:06:34.250> the<00:06:34.310> red<00:06:34.550> that<00:06:35.330> was<00:06:35.480> our<00:06:35.630> kind

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810 
I'd go for for the red that was our kind

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:37.930 
I'd go for for the red that was our kind
of<00:06:35.930> medium<00:06:36.320> line<00:06:36.560> but<00:06:37.100> we<00:06:37.250> ended<00:06:37.490> up<00:06:37.580> finding

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:37.940 
of medium line but we ended up finding

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.400 
of medium line but we ended up finding
out<00:06:38.120> that<00:06:38.330> uh<00:06:38.390> some<00:06:38.690> other<00:06:38.750> colors<00:06:39.110> actually

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:39.410 
out that uh some other colors actually

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.380 
out that uh some other colors actually
worked<00:06:39.560> really<00:06:39.740> good<00:06:40.040> the<00:06:40.640> purple<00:06:40.970> probably

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:41.390 
worked really good the purple probably

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:44.350 
worked really good the purple probably
bled<00:06:41.660> the<00:06:42.260> best<00:06:42.530> that<00:06:42.830> in<00:06:42.980> the<00:06:43.070> blue<00:06:43.360> those

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:44.360 
bled the best that in the blue those

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.900 
bled the best that in the blue those
pigments<00:06:44.810> really<00:06:45.020> did<00:06:45.170> well<00:06:45.610> anything<00:06:46.610> I
