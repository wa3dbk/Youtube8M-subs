know it's in Japanese but the
instructions<00:01:08.400> are<00:01:08.520> totally<00:01:09.060> detailed<00:01:09.479> so

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
instructions are totally detailed so

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.469 
instructions are totally detailed so
don't<00:01:11.340> fret<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:11.880> don't<00:01:12.060> know<00:01:12.150> how<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.330> read

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479

Japanese<00:01:12.930> either<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:13.760> um<00:01:14.760> what<00:01:15.299> makes<00:01:15.540> the

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
Japanese either so um what makes the

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.469 
Japanese either so um what makes the
build<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.960> lot<00:01:16.259> faster<00:01:16.650> for<00:01:17.460> me<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:18.000> that<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.240> put

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
build a lot faster for me is that I put

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.780 
build a lot faster for me is that I put
them<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:18.780> alphabetical<00:01:19.049> order<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.759> can

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
them in alphabetical order so you can

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.899 
them in alphabetical order so you can
find<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.509> pieces<00:01:21.750> instead<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.530> like

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
find the pieces instead of like

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.100 
find the pieces instead of like
clamoring<00:01:23.909> for<00:01:24.150> them<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.780> think<00:01:24.990> that

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
clamoring for them and I think that

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.700 
clamoring for them and I think that
takes<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.619> longest<00:01:26.100> out<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.490> your<00:01:27.000> build<00:01:27.710> so

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
takes the longest out of your build so

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.310 
takes the longest out of your build so
this<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.490> finished<00:01:29.790> product<00:01:30.200> he<00:01:31.200> is

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
this is the finished product he is

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.749 
this is the finished product he is
freaking<00:01:31.979> crazy

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
freaking crazy

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.160 
freaking crazy
dual<00:01:33.150> Maxwell<00:01:33.780> would<00:01:33.990> be<00:01:34.110> proud<00:01:34.430> so<00:01:36.020> here<00:01:37.020> he

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
spending a little bit more money on the

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.960 
spending a little bit more money on the
action<00:02:54.430> basis<00:02:54.849> these<00:02:55.810> ones<00:02:56.459> are<00:02:57.459> my<00:02:57.609> favorite

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
action basis these ones are my favorite

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.909 
action basis these ones are my favorite
that's<00:02:58.120> clear<00:02:58.419> does<00:02:59.260> they<00:02:59.379> match<00:02:59.530> everything

00:02:59.909 --> 00:02:59.919

awesome but I think the clear ones
really<00:03:04.900> look<00:03:05.560> nice<00:03:05.829> for<00:03:06.129> the<00:03:06.189> axiom<00:03:06.700> models

red<00:03:09.549> yellow<00:03:10.120> and<00:03:10.510> blue<00:03:11.200> and<00:03:11.590> as<00:03:12.129> you<00:03:12.250> can<00:03:12.370> see

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
red yellow and blue and as you can see

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.789 
red yellow and blue and as you can see
