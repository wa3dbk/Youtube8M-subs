00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
you how to do that that you would then

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.699 
you how to do that that you would then
be<00:03:46.940> generating<00:03:47.510> a<00:03:47.569> passive<00:03:48.079> stream<00:03:48.380> of<00:03:48.530> income

be generating a passive stream of income

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.920 
be generating a passive stream of income
from<00:03:49.190> so<00:03:49.849> you<00:03:49.940> would<00:03:50.180> move<00:03:50.389> into<00:03:50.599> this<00:03:50.870> a

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
from so you would move into this a

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.539 
from so you would move into this a
little<00:03:51.169> more<00:03:51.290> quickly<00:03:51.769> in<00:03:52.160> that<00:03:52.310> in<00:03:52.489> that

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
little more quickly in that in that

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:55.330 
little more quickly in that in that
respect<00:03:53.299> but<00:03:53.840> in<00:03:54.019> fact<00:03:54.230> this<00:03:54.680> one<00:03:54.980> can

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
respect but in fact this one can

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.030 
respect but in fact this one can
actually<00:03:55.819> be<00:03:55.940> more<00:03:56.239> lucrative<00:03:56.660> faster<00:03:57.560> than

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
actually be more lucrative faster than

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.920 
actually be more lucrative faster than
by<00:03:58.400> even<00:03:58.880> going<00:03:59.180> into<00:03:59.329> the<00:03:59.540> regional

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
both options but it's a great question

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.650 
both options but it's a great question
