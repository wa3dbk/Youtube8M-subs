 but will the signal you receive be 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.970
 digital 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.680
 Have you installed your antenna Marcelinho?

 offers and enjoys the best of television 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.340
 Brazilian 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.710
 you will need the following items 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.700
 an internal installation antenna one 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.190
 converter if required and hdmi cable

 or the first step is to install the 

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:46.379
 antenna 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.210
 you should only opt for the internal antenna 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.589
 if you live near a transmitter 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.410
 digital sign 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:53.250
 the antenna must be installed near the 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.469
 TV 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.719
 but if this is not possible you can 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.179
 use a coaxial cable to install the 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.480
 antenna away from the TV where it captures best 

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:05.250
 the antenna signal installed the second step 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.950
 is to install the cable that will make the 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.659
 connection between the antenna and its 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.840

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.840
 how much less cable is used best for 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.630
 the signal from your TV then save 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:24.299
 if you have chosen to use the converter, 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:26.369
 antenna at the entrance of the antenna to use the 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.070
 converter must be evaluated as

 model of your TV to know if it is 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.259
 necessary or not so the best is 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.850
 read the instruction manual or enter into 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.520
 contact the manufacturer

 lcd 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.790
 the car to be used is the hdm because 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.800

 the input to be used is air or antenna 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.280
 the best thing to do is read the 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:07.720
 manual of your TV to be sure 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.880

 we reached the last step to tune the 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.640
