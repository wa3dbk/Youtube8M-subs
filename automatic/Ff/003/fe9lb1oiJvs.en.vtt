00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:38.240
Dark brown is the river, golden is the sand.
It flows along forever, forever with trees on either hand.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:57.140
Green leaves a-floating, castles of the foam,

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:13.150
Boats of mine a-boating, oh where will all
come home?

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:45.820
On goes the river and out past the mill,
Away down the valley, away down the hill.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:40.960
Away down the river a hundred miles or more,
Other little children shall bring my boats ashore.
