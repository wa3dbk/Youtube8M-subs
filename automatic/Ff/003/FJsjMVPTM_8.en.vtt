one<00:00:00.299> of<00:00:00.450> the<00:00:00.539> ways<00:00:00.690> you<00:00:00.719> can<00:00:01.050> arrange<00:00:01.199> the

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:01.650 
one of the ways you can arrange the

one of the ways you can arrange the
values<00:00:02.070> to<00:00:02.790> set<00:00:03.000> up<00:00:03.120> depth<00:00:03.510> in<00:00:03.750> the<00:00:03.870> painting

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290

values to set up depth in the painting
so<00:00:05.250> your<00:00:05.580> eye<00:00:05.609> jumps<00:00:06.089> hopefully<00:00:06.930> over<00:00:07.740> the

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
so your eye jumps hopefully over the

artists darks because it is hopefully

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.770 
artists darks because it is hopefully
interesting<00:00:10.740> shape<00:00:11.309> and<00:00:12.030> then<00:00:12.480> you<00:00:12.599> can

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
interesting shape and then you can

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.140 
interesting shape and then you can
envision<00:00:13.200> or<00:00:13.559> imagine<00:00:13.590> yourself<00:00:14.429> in<00:00:14.849> this

it should say another thing I try to do
in<00:00:26.670> my<00:00:26.699> painting<00:00:27.300> just<00:00:27.510> go<00:00:27.720> one<00:00:27.960> step<00:00:28.260> further

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
in my painting just go one step further

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.680 
in my painting just go one step further
by<00:00:30.080> trying<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.260> suggest<00:00:31.500> movement<00:00:32.460> all<00:00:32.730> one

reason<00:00:34.110> I'm<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:35.059> fixated<00:00:36.059> on<00:00:36.329> bridges<00:00:36.930> it's

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
reason I'm so fixated on bridges it's

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.440 
reason I'm so fixated on bridges it's
the<00:00:37.649> idea<00:00:38.100> person<00:00:38.760> moving

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.450

the idea person moving
place<00:00:40.990> to<00:00:41.350> another<00:00:42.210> so<00:00:43.210> that<00:00:43.290> that's<00:00:44.290> the<00:00:44.710> idea

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
place to another so that that's the idea

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.370 
place to another so that that's the idea
and<00:00:45.250> the<00:00:45.460> viewers<00:00:45.790> mind<00:00:46.150> of<00:00:46.510> movement<00:00:47.170> which

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:47.380 
and the viewers mind of movement which

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.100 
and the viewers mind of movement which
is<00:00:47.560> yet<00:00:48.550> another<00:00:48.880> dimension<00:00:49.150> beyond<00:00:49.900> the

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.110 
is yet another dimension beyond the

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.160 
is yet another dimension beyond the
usual<00:00:50.620> three<00:00:51.360> there's<00:00:52.360> some<00:00:52.630> movement<00:00:52.810> in

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
usual three there's some movement in

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.100 
usual three there's some movement in
this<00:00:53.320> if<00:00:53.710> you<00:00:53.920> could<00:00:54.070> imagine<00:00:54.190> these<00:00:55.110> proud

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
this if you could imagine these proud

a<00:01:06.040> little<00:01:06.280> note

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
each other that give another center to

mention besides to height width and
depth<00:01:31.000> and<00:01:31.420> give<00:01:31.960> another<00:01:32.230> little

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
depth and give another little

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.899 
depth and give another little
through<00:01:34.850> life<00:01:35.229> so<00:01:36.490> there<00:01:37.490> are<00:01:37.610> little<00:01:37.850> things

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
through life so there are little things

demonstration cleaning the basics are

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.600 
demonstration cleaning the basics are
there<00:01:42.610> and<00:01:43.610> it<00:01:43.850> tells<00:01:44.090> the<00:01:44.329> basic<00:01:44.659> story<00:01:45.049> of

there and it tells the basic story of

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.630 
there and it tells the basic story of
this<00:01:46.610> train<00:01:47.420> Plaza<00:01:47.899> with<00:01:48.409> happy<00:01:49.399> people<00:01:49.640> going

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
but I'm always talking for question two

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.660 
but I'm always talking for question two
before<00:02:14.189> after<00:02:14.700> during<00:02:15.500> no<00:02:16.500> problem<00:02:17.069> at<00:02:17.189> all

before after during no problem at all

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:24.650 
before after during no problem at all
so<00:02:18.420> anybody<00:02:18.659> got<00:02:18.959> anything

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.430 

well<00:02:25.260> my<00:02:25.860> focus<00:02:26.280> right<00:02:26.460> here<00:02:26.760> I<00:02:27.000> think<00:02:27.510> this

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
well my focus right here I think this

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.610 
well my focus right here I think this
person<00:02:28.740> I'll<00:02:29.130> call<00:02:29.400> on<00:02:29.550> her<00:02:29.850> I<00:02:30.240> think<00:02:31.020> she<00:02:31.320> sort

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
person I'll call on her I think she sort

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.809 
person I'll call on her I think she sort
of<00:02:31.740> kept<00:02:32.100> up<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.580> boundary

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
of kept up the boundary

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.270 
of kept up the boundary
because<00:02:35.239> it<00:02:35.420> exactly<00:02:36.170> there<00:02:36.560> and<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:37.010> dark

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280

red there to me it sets the program

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.740 
red there to me it sets the program
right<00:02:40.700> here

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
right here

the<00:03:00.540> way<00:03:00.690> up<00:03:00.840> is<00:03:00.990> planning<00:03:01.500> if<00:03:02.460> it's<00:03:02.700> a<00:03:02.850> detail

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
the way up is planning if it's a detail

the way up is planning if it's a detail
in<00:03:03.540> there<00:03:03.720> but<00:03:06.530> it<00:03:07.530> becomes<00:03:07.830> fussy<00:03:08.550> and<00:03:08.730> I

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
in there but it becomes fussy and I

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.090 
in there but it becomes fussy and I
don't<00:03:08.910> think<00:03:09.330> that<00:03:09.510> really<00:03:09.660> helps<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:10.830> nature

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
don't think that really helps the nature

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.190 
don't think that really helps the nature
of<00:03:11.400> this<00:03:11.550> meaning<00:03:12.060> is<00:03:12.180> fairly<00:03:12.480> quick<00:03:12.900> and

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
of this meaning is fairly quick and

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.800 
of this meaning is fairly quick and
sloppy<00:03:13.770> and<00:03:14.070> wet<00:03:14.130> and<00:03:14.430> loose<00:03:14.610> and<00:03:15.480> so<00:03:15.660> I<00:03:15.720> think

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
sloppy and wet and loose and so I think

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.630 
sloppy and wet and loose and so I think
I<00:03:16.459> think<00:03:17.459> that<00:03:18.000> all<00:03:18.209> pics<00:03:18.750> in<00:03:19.020> belongs<00:03:19.800> the<00:03:20.490> way

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
I think that all pics in belongs the way

I think that all pics in belongs the way
it<00:03:20.790> is<00:03:21.440> any<00:03:22.440> other<00:03:22.680> detail<00:03:23.190> I<00:03:23.220> put<00:03:23.550> in<00:03:23.730> I<00:03:24.000> don't

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
it is any other detail I put in I don't

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.550 
it is any other detail I put in I don't
think<00:03:24.570> it's<00:03:24.810> going<00:03:24.959> to<00:03:25.080> help

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
think it's going to help

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.430 
think it's going to help
I<00:03:25.590> wanted<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.489> water<00:03:26.790> taking<00:03:27.570> care<00:03:27.840> to<00:03:28.230> come

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
up and get the light and be a little

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.300 
up and get the light and be a little
shinier<00:03:31.110> than<00:03:31.320> me<00:03:31.610> so<00:03:32.610> I'm<00:03:33.060> not
