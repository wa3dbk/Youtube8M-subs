points in different ways in different

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.310 
points in different ways in different
shapes<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:42.060> sizes<00:01:42.360> if<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.670> count<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.820> bun<00:01:45.320> it

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
shapes and sizes if you count the bun it

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.980 
shapes and sizes if you count the bun it
looks<00:01:46.560> pretty<00:01:47.310> nice<00:01:47.549> if<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.149> use<00:01:48.390> play<00:01:48.689> more

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
looks pretty nice if you use play more

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.179 
looks pretty nice if you use play more
it<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:50.040> faces<00:01:50.520> down<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.350> as<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.740> can<00:01:52.920> see<00:01:52.950> in

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
it is faces down and as you can see in

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.130 
it is faces down and as you can see in
the<00:01:53.310> video<00:01:53.689> there's<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.899> lot<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.200> types<00:01:55.500> and

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
the video there's a lot of types and

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.780 
the video there's a lot of types and
when<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.290> have<00:01:58.500> this<00:01:58.710> you<00:01:58.920> can<00:01:59.100> double<00:01:59.610> tap

when you have this you can double tap

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.410 
when you have this you can double tap
yep<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:00.869> I<00:02:01.250> don't<00:02:02.250> say<00:02:02.399> double<00:02:02.729> tap<00:02:02.909> ins<00:02:03.090> back

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
yep so I don't say double tap ins back

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.620 
yep so I don't say double tap ins back
but

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
but

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.190 
but
yeah<00:02:06.290> you<00:02:07.189> can<00:02:07.340> still<00:02:07.640> do<00:02:07.909> it<00:02:07.939> but<00:02:08.720> it<00:02:09.170> just

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
yeah you can still do it but it just

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.290 
yeah you can still do it but it just
needs<00:02:09.590> more<00:02:09.709> skill<00:02:10.810> so<00:02:12.640> all<00:02:13.640> you<00:02:13.760> have<00:02:13.819> to<00:02:13.970> do

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
needs more skill so all you have to do

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.650 
needs more skill so all you have to do
is<00:02:14.630> left<00:02:15.590> on<00:02:15.739> the<00:02:15.860> d-pad<00:02:16.040> triangle<00:02:16.940> while<00:02:17.510> you

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
is left on the d-pad triangle while you

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.020 
is left on the d-pad triangle while you
have<00:02:17.780> your<00:02:17.810> second<00:02:18.230> G<00:02:18.380> out<00:02:18.610> do<00:02:19.610> it<00:02:19.670> once<00:02:19.849> or

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
have your second G out do it once or

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.110 
have your second G out do it once or
twice<00:02:20.120> if<00:02:20.390> it<00:02:20.510> doesn't<00:02:20.780> work<00:02:20.930> then<00:02:22.120> you're

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
twice if it doesn't work then you're

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.320 
twice if it doesn't work then you're
doing<00:02:23.330> something<00:02:23.450> wrong<00:02:23.959> but<00:02:24.260> it<00:02:24.739> should<00:02:24.980> work

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
doing something wrong but it should work

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.430
