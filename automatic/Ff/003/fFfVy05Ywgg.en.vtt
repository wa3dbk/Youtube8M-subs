00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:34.059 
whole franchise in diablo 3 is out a lot

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:35.790 
whole franchise in diablo 3 is out a lot
of<00:00:34.120> people<00:00:34.210> plan<00:00:34.449> that<00:00:34.660> and<00:00:34.840> I've<00:00:35.620> been

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
of people plan that and I've been

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.860 
of people plan that and I've been
playing<00:00:36.010> it<00:00:36.160> quite<00:00:36.340> a<00:00:36.370> bit<00:00:36.430> and<00:00:36.760> you<00:00:37.750> know<00:00:37.840> I

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
playing it quite a bit and you know I

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:38.850 
playing it quite a bit and you know I
thought<00:00:38.019> I'd<00:00:38.110> do<00:00:38.199> a<00:00:38.230> little<00:00:38.260> bit<00:00:38.470> of<00:00:38.500> fan<00:00:38.680> art

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
thought I'd do a little bit of fan art

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.190 
thought I'd do a little bit of fan art
and<00:00:39.129> so<00:00:39.910> I<00:00:39.940> just<00:00:40.150> thought<00:00:40.239> I'd<00:00:40.300> hit<00:00:40.809> recording

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200 
and so I just thought I'd hit recording

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.200 
and so I just thought I'd hit recording
the<00:00:41.440> actual<00:00:42.190> drawing<00:00:42.430> won't<00:00:42.610> be<00:00:42.730> finished<00:00:43.000> in

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
the actual drawing won't be finished in

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.690 
the actual drawing won't be finished in
this<00:00:43.450> video<00:00:43.809> but<00:00:44.620> it<00:00:44.649> will<00:00:44.800> be<00:00:44.829> in<00:00:44.980> part<00:00:45.220> to<00:00:45.430> a

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:45.700 
this video but it will be in part to a

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.670 
this video but it will be in part to a
part<00:00:46.660> 1<00:00:46.780> I<00:00:46.809> just<00:00:46.989> wanted<00:00:47.170> to<00:00:47.200> show<00:00:47.320> you<00:00:47.350> exactly

beginning to the end in the first couple

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.900 
beginning to the end in the first couple
sketches<00:00:50.559> you<00:00:50.829> saw<00:00:51.010> there<00:00:51.219> all<00:00:51.340> I<00:00:51.370> was<00:00:51.610> doing

was<00:00:51.940> deciding<00:00:52.719> on<00:00:52.840> the<00:00:53.050> sketch<00:00:53.350> to<00:00:53.379> actually

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
was deciding on the sketch to actually

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.520 
was deciding on the sketch to actually
go<00:00:54.040> forward<00:00:54.370> to<00:00:54.460> the<00:00:54.550> end<00:00:54.640> and<00:00:55.260> this<00:00:56.260> drawing

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
go forward to the end and this drawing

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:57.959 
go forward to the end and this drawing
here<00:00:56.620> is<00:00:56.860> what<00:00:56.980> i'm<00:00:57.070> going<00:00:57.489> to<00:00:57.550> end<00:00:57.610> up<00:00:57.730> picking

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
here is what i'm going to end up picking

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:00.000 
here is what i'm going to end up picking
up<00:00:58.239> mostly<00:00:59.140> because<00:00:59.200> it's<00:00:59.469> simple<00:00:59.649> it's<00:00:59.950> a

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
up mostly because it's simple it's a

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.229 
up mostly because it's simple it's a
sketch<00:01:00.280> you<00:01:00.550> know<00:01:00.640> i<00:01:00.670> didn't<00:01:00.940> want<00:01:01.059> to<00:01:01.090> go<00:01:01.180> too

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
sketch you know i didn't want to go too

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:03.479 
sketch you know i didn't want to go too
crazy<00:01:01.510> so<00:01:02.469> once<00:01:02.590> i<00:01:02.680> have<00:01:02.800> what<00:01:02.920> i<00:01:02.950> selected

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
crazy so once i have what i selected

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:04.920 
crazy so once i have what i selected
there<00:01:03.610> which<00:01:03.760> one<00:01:03.879> I<00:01:03.910> wanted<00:01:04.180> I<00:01:04.330> just<00:01:04.750> copied

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
there which one I wanted I just copied

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.420 
there which one I wanted I just copied
it<00:01:05.170> made<00:01:05.470> it<00:01:05.560> a<00:01:05.619> little<00:01:05.740> bit<00:01:05.890> bigger<00:01:06.039> so<00:01:06.280> I'd

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
it made it a little bit bigger so I'd

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.350 
it made it a little bit bigger so I'd
some<00:01:06.610> room<00:01:06.729> to<00:01:06.759> play<00:01:06.850> around<00:01:07.119> with<00:01:07.330> and

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
some room to play around with and

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.109 
some room to play around with and
drawing<00:01:07.840> and<00:01:08.100> lower<00:01:09.100> the<00:01:09.250> opacity<00:01:09.340> made<00:01:09.880> a<00:01:09.910> new

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
drawing and lower the opacity made a new

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:12.270 
drawing and lower the opacity made a new
sketch<00:01:10.390> layer<00:01:10.630> and<00:01:10.920> just<00:01:11.920> going<00:01:12.070> in<00:01:12.190> there

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
sketch layer and just going in there

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.850 
sketch layer and just going in there
with<00:01:12.399> some<00:01:12.610> tighter<00:01:12.970> lineart<00:01:13.619> this<00:01:14.619> way<00:01:14.740> when

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
with some tighter lineart this way when

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.440 
with some tighter lineart this way when
I<00:01:14.890> ink<00:01:15.069> over<00:01:15.280> top<00:01:15.459> of<00:01:15.490> it<00:01:15.729> everything<00:01:16.330> I<00:01:16.390> need

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
I ink over top of it everything I need

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:17.850 
I ink over top of it everything I need
is<00:01:16.600> already<00:01:16.899> in<00:01:16.990> there<00:01:17.140> and<00:01:17.289> actually<00:01:17.679> i

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
is already in there and actually i

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.169 
is already in there and actually i
should<00:01:18.009> point<00:01:18.280> out<00:01:18.399> to<00:01:18.580> in<00:01:18.729> case<00:01:18.819> you<00:01:18.970> haven't

00:01:19.169 --> 00:01:19.179

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
there and I actually start doing some

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:19.080 
there and I actually start doing some
cross<00:02:18.310> hatching<00:02:18.579> and<00:02:18.730> that<00:02:18.819> kind<00:02:19.000> of<00:02:19.030> stuff

cross hatching and that kind of stuff
right<00:02:19.360> there<00:02:19.390> that<00:02:19.599> hatching<00:02:19.989> I<00:02:20.140> find<00:02:20.620> in

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
right there that hatching I find in

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:21.710 
right there that hatching I find in
manga<00:02:20.980> studio<00:02:21.129> is

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
manga studio is

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.330 
manga studio is
more<00:02:21.960> easier<00:02:22.320> to<00:02:22.470> do<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:22.800> it<00:02:22.860> actually<00:02:22.890> comes

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
more easier to do and it actually comes

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.060 
more easier to do and it actually comes
out<00:02:23.550> looking<00:02:23.760> crisp<00:02:24.210> and<00:02:24.390> nice<00:02:24.800> way<00:02:25.800> more

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
out looking crisp and nice way more

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.010 
out looking crisp and nice way more
better<00:02:26.220> way<00:02:26.700> more<00:02:26.880> better<00:02:27.060> let<00:02:27.780> me<00:02:27.840> try<00:02:27.960> that

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
better way more better let me try that

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.120 
better way more better let me try that
again<00:02:28.940> better<00:02:29.940> than<00:02:30.620> how<00:02:31.620> I<00:02:31.650> would<00:02:31.860> normally

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
again better than how I would normally

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.100 
again better than how I would normally
do<00:02:32.220> in<00:02:32.310> Photoshop<00:02:32.790> or<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.510> line<00:02:33.660> quality<00:02:33.840> is

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
do in Photoshop or the line quality is

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.210 
do in Photoshop or the line quality is
much<00:02:34.260> more<00:02:34.550> you<00:02:35.550> know<00:02:35.670> I<00:02:36.440> seem<00:02:37.440> I<00:02:37.740> want<00:02:38.100> to<00:02:38.130> say

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
much more you know I seem I want to say

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.680 
much more you know I seem I want to say
legit<00:02:38.580> but<00:02:38.760> it<00:02:38.850> feels<00:02:38.970> better<00:02:39.330> in<00:02:39.420> manga

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
legit but it feels better in manga

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.020 
legit but it feels better in manga
studio<00:02:39.840> that<00:02:40.140> it<00:02:40.230> doesn't<00:02:40.500> Photoshop<00:02:41.250> and

video<00:03:25.290> here<00:03:25.650> once<00:03:26.640> I<00:03:26.730> decided<00:03:27.030> at<00:03:27.209> that<00:03:27.239> point

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
video here once I decided at that point

of a light source and as you can see i'm

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.250

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
starting to decide where the light

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.810 
starting to decide where the light
source<00:03:31.470> is<00:03:31.680> because<00:03:31.950> i'm<00:03:32.040> adding<00:03:32.459> more<00:03:32.610> heavy

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820

shadow from work a shadow from his nose
would<00:03:44.670> be<00:03:44.820> and<00:03:45.150> then<00:03:45.780> I'm<00:03:45.840> gonna<00:03:45.959> have<00:03:46.080> to

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
would be and then I'm gonna have to

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.240 
would be and then I'm gonna have to
carry<00:03:46.290> that<00:03:46.470> all<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:46.709> way<00:03:46.860> up<00:03:46.980> into<00:03:47.160> the<00:03:47.220> eye

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
carry that all the way up into the eye

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.280 
carry that all the way up into the eye
and<00:03:47.580> the<00:03:47.640> I<00:03:47.940> was<00:03:48.209> actually<00:03:48.360> buggy<00:03:48.780> bugging<00:03:49.230> me

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
and the I was actually buggy bugging me

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.150 
and the I was actually buggy bugging me
a<00:03:49.320> little<00:03:49.410> bit<00:03:49.530> because<00:03:49.620> no<00:03:49.860> matter<00:03:49.950> what<00:03:50.040> i

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
a little bit because no matter what i

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.620 
a little bit because no matter what i
was<00:03:50.310> doing<00:03:50.580> it<00:03:50.730> was<00:03:50.820> you<00:03:51.060> know<00:03:51.180> wasn't<00:03:51.360> looking

good<00:03:51.810> right<00:03:52.230> there<00:03:52.410> i<00:03:52.470> thought<00:03:52.650> it<00:03:52.769> looked

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
good right there i thought it looked

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.800 
good right there i thought it looked
okay<00:03:53.160> but<00:03:53.190> I'm<00:03:54.060> what<00:03:54.180> I<00:03:54.209> end<00:03:54.390> up<00:03:54.450> doing<00:03:54.510> is

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
okay but I'm what I end up doing is

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.570 
okay but I'm what I end up doing is
going<00:03:54.930> over<00:03:55.110> then<00:03:55.230> I<00:03:55.290> just<00:03:55.410> flood<00:03:56.220> fill<00:03:56.430> that

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
going over then I just flood fill that

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.250 
going over then I just flood fill that
hole<00:03:56.820> I'd<00:03:57.030> black<00:03:57.299> gives<00:03:57.840> a<00:03:57.900> little<00:03:58.019> bit<00:03:58.110> more

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
hole I'd black gives a little bit more

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.650 
hole I'd black gives a little bit more

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
right now but it wasn't coming out so

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.010 
right now but it wasn't coming out so
i'm<00:05:08.430> just<00:05:08.460> using<00:05:08.729> the<00:05:08.880> lasso<00:05:09.210> tool<00:05:09.240> i'm<00:05:09.660> just

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
i'm just using the lasso tool i'm just

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.690 
i'm just using the lasso tool i'm just
going<00:05:10.139> to<00:05:10.169> fill<00:05:10.380> that<00:05:10.410> with<00:05:10.620> black<00:05:10.889> get<00:05:11.550> some

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
going to fill that with black get some

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.100 
going to fill that with black get some
shapes<00:05:11.940> in<00:05:12.120> there<00:05:12.270> it<00:05:12.510> just<00:05:12.750> makes<00:05:12.870> a<00:05:12.990> little

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
shapes in there it just makes a little

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.750 
shapes in there it just makes a little
bit<00:05:13.260> more<00:05:13.350> easier<00:05:13.680> in<00:05:13.770> the<00:05:13.800> points<00:05:14.220> like<00:05:14.580> the

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
bit more easier in the points like the

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.670 
bit more easier in the points like the
line<00:05:15.090> work<00:05:15.240> is<00:05:15.360> a<00:05:15.419> little<00:05:15.450> bit<00:05:15.660> more<00:05:15.750> sharp<00:05:16.110> and

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
line work is a little bit more sharp and

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.409 
line work is a little bit more sharp and
just<00:05:17.430> flipping<00:05:17.669> the<00:05:17.729> image<00:05:17.910> rager<00:05:18.060> so<00:05:18.210> i<00:05:18.270> can

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
just flipping the image rager so i can

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:20.030 
just flipping the image rager so i can
see<00:05:18.600> a<00:05:18.630> little<00:05:18.870> bit<00:05:18.990> of<00:05:19.050> how<00:05:19.139> it's<00:05:19.290> going<00:05:19.560> it<00:05:19.830> is

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
see a little bit of how it's going it is

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.379 
see a little bit of how it's going it is
looking<00:05:20.280> a<00:05:20.310> little<00:05:20.400> flat<00:05:20.790> right<00:05:21.000> now<00:05:21.150> i

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:21.389 
looking a little flat right now i

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:23.540 
looking a little flat right now i
probably<00:05:22.139> go<00:05:22.410> back<00:05:22.560> and<00:05:22.740> i'll<00:05:22.800> erase<00:05:23.040> the<00:05:23.370> top

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
probably go back and i'll erase the top

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.580 
probably go back and i'll erase the top
of<00:05:23.700> his<00:05:23.790> head<00:05:23.820> that<00:05:24.180> line<00:05:24.450> it<00:05:25.139> looks<00:05:25.350> a<00:05:25.440> little

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
of his head that line it looks a little

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:30.110 
of his head that line it looks a little
too<00:05:25.889> small<00:05:28.190> it's<00:05:29.190> kind<00:05:29.430> of<00:05:29.550> you<00:05:29.820> can<00:05:29.910> see<00:05:30.030> i'm

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
too small it's kind of you can see i'm

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.150 
too small it's kind of you can see i'm
kind<00:05:30.360> of<00:05:30.389> adjusting<00:05:30.840> it<00:05:30.960> right<00:05:31.080> there<00:05:31.320> and

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
kind of adjusting it right there and

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.200 
kind of adjusting it right there and
then<00:05:32.250> I<00:05:32.310> realize<00:05:32.580> there's<00:05:32.669> I'm<00:05:32.820> gonna<00:05:32.940> it's

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
then I realize there's I'm gonna it's

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.219 
then I realize there's I'm gonna it's
going<00:05:33.360> to<00:05:33.419> be<00:05:33.510> a<00:05:33.539> problem<00:05:33.720> there<00:05:33.990> so<00:05:34.110> we're

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:34.229 
going to be a problem there so we're

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:36.110 
going to be a problem there so we're
just<00:05:34.260> going<00:05:34.440> to<00:05:34.560> go<00:05:34.889> back<00:05:35.100> and<00:05:35.310> I<00:05:35.550> might<00:05:35.729> now

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
just going to go back and I might now

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.310 
just going to go back and I might now
