it<00:01:00.570> like<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.109> lot<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.320> times<00:01:01.590> you'll<00:01:01.800> see<00:01:02.750> at

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
it like a lot of times you'll see at

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:06.710 
it like a lot of times you'll see at
gtx460<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.549> know<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.760> new<00:01:05.850> nvidia<00:01:06.090> card<00:01:06.479> and

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
gtx460 you know the new nvidia card and

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.289 
gtx460 you know the new nvidia card and
you'll<00:01:06.840> see<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:06.990> gtx<00:01:07.409> 460m<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.939> think<00:01:09.119> well

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
you'll see a gtx 460m and you think well

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.250 
you'll see a gtx 460m and you think well
what's<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.570> difference<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:10.049> know<00:01:10.110> it's

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
what's the difference you know it's

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.230 
what's the difference you know it's
obviously<00:01:10.619> it's<00:01:11.070> going<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.280> have<00:01:11.369> gtx<00:01:11.760> 460

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
obviously it's going to have gtx 460

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.929 
obviously it's going to have gtx 460
power<00:01:12.479> this<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.229> wrong<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:14.430> only<00:01:14.580> time<00:01:14.790> this

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
power this is wrong the only time this

power this is wrong the only time this
was<00:01:15.119> somewhat<00:01:15.570> soon<00:01:15.930> as<00:01:16.049> somewhat<00:01:16.439> correct

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
was somewhat soon as somewhat correct

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
was the AMD mobility 4000 series in

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.530 
was the AMD mobility 4000 series in
which<00:01:21.270> case<00:01:21.509> you'd<00:01:21.869> find<00:01:22.170> like<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.680> mobility

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
which case you'd find like a mobility

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.170 
which case you'd find like a mobility
4850<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:25.350> mobility<00:01:25.770> 4850<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.610> act<00:01:26.880> was

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
4850 and the mobility 4850 is act was

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.870 
4850 and the mobility 4850 is act was
actually<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.829> slowed<00:01:28.829> down<00:01:28.860> version<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.790> the

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
actually a slowed down version of the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.730 
actually a slowed down version of the
4850<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.750> desktop<00:01:31.140> they<00:01:31.290> actually<00:01:31.619> had

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
4850 and the desktop they actually had

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.880 
4850 and the desktop they actually had
the<00:01:31.890> same<00:01:32.070> hardware<00:01:32.520> but<00:01:33.270> they<00:01:33.450> were<00:01:33.600> just

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
the same hardware but they were just

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.899 
the same hardware but they were just
significantly<00:01:34.890> clock<00:01:35.159> down<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.400> her<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.729> save

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
significantly clock down to her to save

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.569 
significantly clock down to her to save
power<00:01:36.259> if<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.380> go<00:01:37.500> up<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.799> 5000<00:01:38.430> series

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
power if you go up to the 5000 series

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.060 
power if you go up to the 5000 series
they're<00:01:38.880> actually<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.659> model<00:01:40.110> behind<00:01:40.619> itself

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
they're actually the model behind itself

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.139 
they're actually the model behind itself
so<00:01:41.579> if<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.790> find<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.329> mobility<00:01:43.280> 5870<00:01:44.280> AMD<00:01:44.939> chip

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
so if you find a mobility 5870 AMD chip

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.310 
so if you find a mobility 5870 AMD chip
in<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.630> laptop<00:01:46.079> it's<00:01:46.619> actually<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.250> desktop<00:01:48.320> 5770

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
in a laptop it's actually a desktop 5770

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.310 
in a laptop it's actually a desktop 5770
not<00:01:49.649> ship<00:01:50.009> so<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.430> mean<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:51.479> changes<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:52.110> mean

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
not ship so I mean that changes I mean

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.020 
not ship so I mean that changes I mean
you<00:01:52.409> really<00:01:52.439> can't<00:01:52.829> use<00:01:52.979> that<00:01:53.009> for<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.460> base<00:01:53.700> on

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
you really can't use that for a base on

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.469 
you really can't use that for a base on
what<00:01:54.420> is<00:01:54.600> what<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.350> power<00:01:55.649> what's<00:01:55.979> not<00:01:56.479> so

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
what is what is power what's not so

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.050 
what is what is power what's not so
without<00:01:57.990> further<00:01:58.049> ado<00:01:58.530> let's<00:01:58.920> take<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.430> head

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
without further ado let's take a head

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:07.370

now<00:02:08.380> it's<00:02:08.590> kind<00:02:08.740> of<00:02:08.770> a<00:02:08.860> busy<00:02:09.130> website<00:02:09.520> there's

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
now it's kind of a busy website there's

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.300 
now it's kind of a busy website there's
a<00:02:09.760> lot<00:02:09.970> of<00:02:10.000> stuff<00:02:10.360> on<00:02:10.540> a<00:02:10.570> lot<00:02:10.869> of<00:02:11.020> ads<00:02:11.230> and<00:02:11.620> you

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
a lot of stuff on a lot of ads and you

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.680 
a lot of stuff on a lot of ads and you
know<00:02:12.400> all<00:02:12.700> these<00:02:12.820> things<00:02:12.880> going<00:02:13.120> on<00:02:13.420> and

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
know all these things going on and

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.240 
know all these things going on and
there's<00:02:14.440> a<00:02:14.530> little<00:02:16.110> those<00:02:17.110> little<00:02:17.140> reviews<00:02:17.980> on

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
there's a little those little reviews on

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.400 
there's a little those little reviews on
specific<00:02:19.180> notebooks<00:02:19.600> and<00:02:19.900> netbooks<00:02:19.930> and

specific notebooks and netbooks and

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.270 
specific notebooks and netbooks and
let's<00:02:20.680> Jes<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:22.120> look<00:02:22.270> over<00:02:22.360> here<00:02:22.660> though<00:02:23.280> this

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
let's Jes you look over here though this

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.670 
let's Jes you look over here though this
is<00:02:24.700> a<00:02:24.940> lineup<00:02:25.330> of<00:02:25.720> all<00:02:25.960> the<00:02:26.140> current<00:02:26.410> video

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
is a lineup of all the current video

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.180 
is a lineup of all the current video
cards<00:02:27.120> on<00:02:28.140> laptops<00:02:29.140> and<00:02:29.410> when<00:02:29.590> I<00:02:29.650> say<00:02:29.860> current

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
cards on laptops and when I say current

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.740 
cards on laptops and when I say current
I<00:02:30.280> use<00:02:30.400> that<00:02:30.460> term<00:02:30.730> liberal<00:02:31.120> lake<00:02:31.390> so<00:02:31.540> it<00:02:31.570> goes

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
I use that term liberal lake so it goes

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.840 
I use that term liberal lake so it goes
quite<00:02:31.990> a<00:02:32.020> ways<00:02:32.200> back<00:02:32.410> and<00:02:33.070> it<00:02:33.340> actually<00:02:33.490> shows

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
quite a ways back and it actually shows

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.240 
quite a ways back and it actually shows
you<00:02:34.180> like<00:02:34.450> where<00:02:34.510> each<00:02:35.080> card<00:02:35.530> is<00:02:35.680> performance

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
you like where each card is performance

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:42.090 
you like where each card is performance
wise<00:02:37.560> they're<00:02:38.560> also<00:02:38.710> going<00:02:38.890> to<00:02:38.950> have<00:02:41.100> searches

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
wise they're also going to have searches

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.500 
wise they're also going to have searches
for<00:02:42.430> like<00:02:43.980> CPUs<00:02:44.980> you<00:02:45.760> know<00:02:45.880> to<00:02:45.940> have<00:02:46.270> a<00:02:46.300> lot<00:02:46.480> of

and in these two units it was five 8400
and<00:03:43.570> a<00:03:43.720> lot<00:03:43.870> of<00:03:43.959> times<00:03:44.140> you'll<00:03:44.350> see<00:03:44.530> this<00:03:44.739> and

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
and a lot of times you'll see this and

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.620 
and a lot of times you'll see this and
they're<00:03:45.489> actually<00:03:46.320> different<00:03:48.630> they're

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
they're actually different they're

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:50.850 
they're actually different they're
called<00:03:49.840> different<00:03:50.140> models<00:03:50.500> like<00:03:50.739> you'll

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
called different models like you'll

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.790 
called different models like you'll
actually<00:03:50.950> see<00:03:51.340> like<00:03:51.519> you<00:03:52.360> know<00:03:52.390> in<00:03:53.080> Nvidia's

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
actually see like you know in Nvidia's

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.670 
actually see like you know in Nvidia's
case<00:03:54.040> it's<00:03:54.370> like<00:03:54.489> the<00:03:54.610> gt2<00:03:54.940> 30<00:03:55.330> and<00:03:55.600> the<00:03:55.690> GT<00:03:56.019> 240

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
case it's like the gt2 30 and the GT 240

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.850 
case it's like the gt2 30 and the GT 240
mobiles<00:03:57.340> are<00:03:57.670> the<00:03:58.480> same<00:03:58.720> chip<00:03:59.140> but<00:03:59.620> there<00:03:59.769> are

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
mobiles are the same chip but there are

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.509 
mobiles are the same chip but there are
different<00:04:00.130> speeds<00:04:00.400> and<00:04:01.920> you'll<00:04:02.920> see<00:04:03.130> like<00:04:03.370> the

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
different speeds and you'll see like the

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.160

it where it lines up with these other
ones<00:04:07.440> some<00:04:08.440> more<00:04:08.590> benchmarks<00:04:09.190> and<00:04:09.790> then<00:04:10.209> they

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
ones some more benchmarks and then they

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.800 
ones some more benchmarks and then they
have<00:04:10.530> like<00:04:11.530> a<00:04:11.980> game<00:04:12.519> performance<00:04:12.760> and

cards that are currently out there and

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:39.629 
cards that are currently out there and
you<00:04:38.500> can<00:04:38.560> compare<00:04:38.889> them<00:04:39.040> against<00:04:39.370> each<00:04:39.430> other

you can compare them against each other

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:45.860 
you can compare them against each other
like<00:04:40.120> if<00:04:40.240> you<00:04:41.880> checked<00:04:42.880> out<00:04:42.970> like<00:04:43.120> a<00:04:43.180> 5870

works<00:05:03.070> out<00:05:03.340> remember<00:05:03.639> how<00:05:03.760> I<00:05:03.790> said<00:05:03.880> that<00:05:04.270> the

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
works out remember how I said that the

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.219 
works out remember how I said that the
5770<00:05:05.550> her<00:05:06.550> 5870<00:05:07.180> was<00:05:07.330> the<00:05:07.389> same<00:05:07.540> as<00:05:07.570> a<00:05:07.780> 5770

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229 
5770 her 5870 was the same as a 5770

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:11.580 
5770 her 5870 was the same as a 5770

German site so um and I don't mean that
many<00:05:40.419> like<00:05:40.660> spelling<00:05:41.229> error<00:05:41.530> way<00:05:41.740> but<00:05:42.010> I<00:05:42.039> think

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
many like spelling error way but I think

many like spelling error way but I think
I've<00:05:42.430> seen<00:05:42.940> the<00:05:43.060> German<00:05:43.360> version<00:05:43.389> of<00:05:43.840> the<00:05:43.900> site

I've seen the German version of the site

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:46.830 
I've seen the German version of the site
before<00:05:44.560> and<00:05:44.740> it's<00:05:45.000> you<00:05:46.000> translate<00:05:46.510> and<00:05:46.690> it

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
before and it's you translate and it

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.620 
before and it's you translate and it
comes<00:05:46.990> out<00:05:47.080> pretty<00:05:47.229> much<00:05:47.470> like<00:05:47.680> this<00:05:47.889> so

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630
