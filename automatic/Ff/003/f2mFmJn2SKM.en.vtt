00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
yeah I didn't think it was in the

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.620 
yeah I didn't think it was in the
bargain<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.850> be<00:01:42.000> honest<00:01:42.270> I<00:01:42.360> never<00:01:42.479> really

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
bargain to be honest I never really

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.219 
bargain to be honest I never really
think<00:01:43.079> like<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:43.500> Jim<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.890> stock<00:01:44.130> car<00:01:44.369> race<00:01:44.640> but

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
think like that Jim a stock car race but

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.170 
think like that Jim a stock car race but
after<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.470> first<00:01:47.070> few<00:01:47.280> laps<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.820> was<00:01:47.939> so

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
after the first few laps it was so

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.899 
after the first few laps it was so
uneventful<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:49.259> thought<00:01:49.799> yeah<00:01:50.369> we've<00:01:50.610> got<00:01:50.790> this

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
uneventful I thought yeah we've got this

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.539 
uneventful I thought yeah we've got this
one<00:01:51.149> here<00:01:51.180> but<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:51.930> think<00:01:52.500> if<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:52.950> went<00:01:53.189> in<00:01:53.399> it

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
one here but I think if it went in it

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.340 
one here but I think if it went in it
