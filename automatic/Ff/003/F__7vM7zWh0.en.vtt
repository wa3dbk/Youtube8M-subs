00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.690

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.400
 faceless 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.340
 Scratching springs means often first 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:28.320
 queue we really need to have jalapenas 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:30.150
 that is, if we don't have this, then we can 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.740
 Taku can score on any more there 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.960

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.520
 Must be, of course, nude 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:42.480

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.579
 avocado 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.739
 well, as usual, I can't be with me 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.989
 one hand 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:07.979
 2 my mouth keeps the phone of my mind to 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:13.740
 shoot here and well here and all things srezh 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:16.229
 excess lemon then we cut the tomato to us 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.369
 will need to cut into slices and 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.259
 get rid of the skin less often this 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.330
 finely fingers mister basked it 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.630
 place damn tvarine cherry lemon 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:31.159
 just in half and in general now i'm getting 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:36.479
 scroll of the ancient cutting spell and 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:38.610
 caste it then, well, we all cut 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.430
 anyhow as usual but it's not 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.710
 fundamentally if for example my 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.470
 how here a piece seems to have stayed 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.040
 tomato is not so important dish 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:53.970
 will not spoil okay it's time for us to fire now 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.850
 onions so what else we continue well I 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.600
 I filled the pan with oil I prefer 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.450
 no, well, no, how can I say 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.630
 add a little bit of oil 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.879
 olive but i prefer bigger and 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.459
 just then his plum and rub on the buzz 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.250
 when all fry first as for me 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.570
 better warm it up 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:17.220
 frying pan and butter before there 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.380
 throw a bow but 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.810
 minutes already passed begins already 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:26.310
 twitch oil is a sure sign that it's time 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:29.340
 fry onions ok polina did not invent a box 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.980
 do it with gosh fingers huge 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:36.210
 red fingers so still interfere 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:38.640
 Now I think a minute or two will be enough but I 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.780
 I love that right here fried onion was 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:45.350
 know to make it with a golden crust 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.040
 have you got green and your boss 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:52.020
 param pam pashki 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:57.810
 but after a couple of minutes it will be 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:03:02.760
 green okay quiet sharing conquer 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:04.380
 I am the lord of the bow, command the bow oh here 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.210
 what do i like when you cook 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:11.490
 so it is that all sorts of flavors know 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:16.170
 stirs the imagination and 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:18.800
 and once burning 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:24.420
 hunger so when the lip dish is ready 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:27.690
 already the whole growth of people's hair and and ready for 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.300
 eating food and the one who cooks it like 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.070
 rule but if he has 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:33.990
 the room smells there and he doesn't 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:37.740
 observe all this action 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:40.110
 his appetite is not that great 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:44.850
 already want to eat waiting to be all ready 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:51.120
 but so far the onions are not really fried 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:55.170
 Of course it is a matter of a few seconds here 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:58.830
 then we stop it all just 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.400
 leave and go to prepare the filling for 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.060
 so y 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.630
 Well, actually he himself is not that cakes and 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:10.260

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.570
 I did not take a spoon and 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:24.330
 you see 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:28.870

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:31.270
 take the war does not know will not have to have 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.170
 a little memory is not necessary especially 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.070

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:38.230

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:44.170
 zealous not necessary but still well 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:47.080
 take paprika of course it's just 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:50.740
 damn spice in so perfect 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:05:03.180
 fits in and add all this 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:05:03.180
 and tomatoes and hla lamb cilantro and avocado 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:13.360
 Shuffle don't take it in head I don't want to fall 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:17.080
 wear this bit wipe and back away 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:19.420
 but super master Misha doesn't live belly and 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.310
 msi help to notice you only one 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:24.720
 arm 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:28.180
 take sea salt i prefer 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:30.250
 french so quiet calm spouse 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:33.010
 also do not have to go too well, you can still 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:42.130
 add pepper okay let's add 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:46.750
 there are four kinds of pepper handy thing yes 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:53.230
 and half a lime can someone more 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:55.930
 like to use lemon, you know everything 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:06:01.300
 there is still a difference between lime and lemon 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:04.000
 Lime is somehow softer and tastier as well as 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:06.190
 according to me repair some dishes too 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.770
 great fit again the hand will start 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:11.820
 burn and god in general okay i 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:14.920
 sat normally mix and come back 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:16.840
 so well I mixed everything up normally 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:19.870
 now we take the actual facial 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:22.570
 rice cake can be heated but I 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:25.000
 it seems not necessarily take a sheet of it 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:28.300
 itâ€™s very important to look at the list 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:32.190
 do not put it like this 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:34.990
 Well, how to say these parts with 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:36.640
 Well, as they approached each other because 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.450
 when we get here food will bulk it up 

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.570
 big pile 

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:43.360
 we'll eat the right side and squeezing 

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:45.430
 a scone of food as will fit up 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.370
 and away from where we are 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:50.410
 squeeze that is if we say here 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:53.080
 so make food will stupidly reload 

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:57.570
 through so it sucks and so she 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:59.410
 It will be here in this pocket and pulled together 

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:03.930
 respectively, on the left side is better not 

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:07.930
 there is nothing we take just means ah 

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:10.720
 yummy just fierce yummy we take with 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:15.720
 and according to them here but from the fact that we have 

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:20.560
 It turned out here I think not 1 tako will 

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:24.340
 not enough but definitely enough for 2 

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:30.160
 Well, put it like this We take this already merged 

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:34.290
 oil is not convenient with one hand put 

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:39.430
 From above the bow I will begin to do everything and continue 

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:41.830
 well 2 so ready and in the right hands 

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:45.160

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:50.740
 take it like that from the country bite 

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:52.750
 and gradually eat it fucking sweet 

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:54.730
