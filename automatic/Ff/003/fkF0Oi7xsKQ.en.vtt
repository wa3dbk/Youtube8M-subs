well<00:00:01.140> if<00:00:01.260> you've<00:00:01.380> been<00:00:01.439> a<00:00:01.560> little<00:00:01.770> bit<00:00:01.920> curious

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
well if you've been a little bit curious

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.760 
well if you've been a little bit curious
to<00:00:02.669> see<00:00:02.700> what<00:00:03.090> it<00:00:03.210> looks<00:00:03.389> like<00:00:03.510> inside<00:00:04.290> of<00:00:04.589> one

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
to see what it looks like inside of one

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.039 
to see what it looks like inside of one
of<00:00:04.799> our<00:00:05.100> charred<00:00:05.460> oak<00:00:05.640> barrels<00:00:05.700> I<00:00:06.359> thought<00:00:06.899> I'd

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
of our charred oak barrels I thought I'd

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.720 
of our charred oak barrels I thought I'd
give<00:00:07.290> you<00:00:07.410> a<00:00:07.440> video<00:00:07.710> and<00:00:08.160> show<00:00:08.340> you<00:00:08.400> what<00:00:08.610> it

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
give you a video and show you what it

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.910 
give you a video and show you what it
looks<00:00:08.910> like<00:00:09.090> first<00:00:09.660> of<00:00:09.870> all<00:00:10.019> once<00:00:10.380> you<00:00:10.590> take

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
looks like first of all once you take

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.160 
looks like first of all once you take
the<00:00:11.099> hoops<00:00:11.340> off<00:00:11.550> now<00:00:12.179> this<00:00:12.509> is<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:12.719> barrel

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
the hoops off now this is a barrel

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.709 
the hoops off now this is a barrel
that's<00:00:13.290> actually<00:00:13.710> been<00:00:13.920> used<00:00:14.340> so<00:00:14.880> once<00:00:15.480> it's

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
that's actually been used so once it's

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.740 
that's actually been used so once it's
been<00:00:15.929> cured<00:00:16.440> what<00:00:17.220> will<00:00:17.340> happen<00:00:17.789> is<00:00:18.090> if<00:00:18.570> you

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
been cured what will happen is if you

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.290 
been cured what will happen is if you
let<00:00:18.960> it<00:00:18.990> dry<00:00:19.410> out<00:00:19.650> then<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.490> course<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:21.060> wood

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
let it dry out then of course the wood

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.769 
let it dry out then of course the wood
will<00:00:21.949> will<00:00:22.949> contract<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:24.029> then<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.570> hoops

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
will will contract and then the hoops

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.109 
will will contract and then the hoops
actually<00:00:25.199> will<00:00:25.350> just<00:00:25.380> fall<00:00:25.949> right<00:00:26.220> off<00:00:26.250> so

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
actually will just fall right off so

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.390 
actually will just fall right off so
there's<00:00:27.630> six<00:00:27.900> loops<00:00:28.380> on<00:00:28.650> each<00:00:28.859> one<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.250> our

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
there's six loops on each one of our

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.690 
there's six loops on each one of our
barrels<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.240> you'll<00:00:31.199> notice<00:00:31.500> that<00:00:31.700> the

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
barrels and you'll notice that the

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.630 
barrels and you'll notice that the
staves<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.809> head<00:00:34.160> there<00:00:35.160> there's<00:00:35.489> not

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
staves and the head there there's not

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.760 
staves and the head there there's not
any<00:00:35.850> type<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.210> glue<00:00:36.510> or<00:00:36.719> nails<00:00:36.750> that<00:00:37.350> holds<00:00:37.680> it

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
any type of glue or nails that holds it

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.580 
any type of glue or nails that holds it
together<00:00:37.920> it's<00:00:38.550> it's<00:00:39.149> just<00:00:40.020> like<00:00:40.230> they<00:00:40.379> make

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
together it's it's just like they make

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.100 
together it's it's just like they make
the<00:00:40.770> full-size<00:00:41.520> barrels<00:00:42.149> it's<00:00:42.570> all<00:00:42.840> held

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
the full-size barrels it's all held

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.850 
the full-size barrels it's all held
together<00:00:43.260> by<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.829> pressure<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.360> water

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
together by the pressure of the water

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.080 
together by the pressure of the water
the<00:00:46.860> liquor<00:00:47.129> soaking<00:00:47.879> into<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:49.140> actual<00:00:49.680> wood

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
the liquor soaking into the actual wood

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.330 
the liquor soaking into the actual wood
against<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.239> hoops<00:00:51.649> but<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.800> can<00:00:52.980> see<00:00:53.160> the

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
against the hoops but you can see the

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.700 
against the hoops but you can see the
staves<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:54.059> mean<00:00:54.270> each<00:00:54.449> one<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.780> these<00:00:54.899> fits<00:00:55.440> on

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
staves I mean each one of these fits on

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.610 
staves I mean each one of these fits on
each<00:00:56.010> side<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.460> head<00:00:56.730> like<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.719> then

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
each side of the head like that and then

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.529 
each side of the head like that and then
of<00:00:58.829> course<00:00:58.890> it's<00:00:59.340> charred<00:01:00.109> this<00:01:01.109> one<00:01:01.320> here<00:01:01.680> has

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
of course it's charred this one here has

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.679 
of course it's charred this one here has
lived<00:01:03.539> its<00:01:03.870> life<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.559> been<00:01:04.860> used<00:01:05.479> for<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:06.510> guess

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
lived its life and been used for I guess

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.730 
lived its life and been used for I guess
I<00:01:06.960> probably<00:01:07.110> used<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.560> for<00:01:07.710> about<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.920> year<00:01:08.340> now

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
I probably used it for about a year now

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.190 
I probably used it for about a year now
these<00:01:10.740> barrels<00:01:11.250> are<00:01:11.610> made<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.840> mean

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
these barrels are made so that I mean

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.890 
these barrels are made so that I mean
you<00:01:13.560> could<00:01:13.920> reach<00:01:14.310> are<00:01:14.729> these<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.420> use<00:01:15.659> these

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
you could reach are these and use these

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.130 
you could reach are these and use these
again<00:01:16.820> what<00:01:17.820> you'd<00:01:18.270> have<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.659> do<00:01:18.840> though<00:01:19.080> you

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
again what you'd have to do though you

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.990 
again what you'd have to do though you
wouldn't<00:01:19.500> want<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.770> take<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.070> apart<00:01:20.189> you

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
wouldn't want to take it apart you

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.090 
wouldn't want to take it apart you
wouldn't<00:01:21.270> want<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.450> dry<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.780> out<00:01:22.080> either<00:01:22.439> what

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
wouldn't want to dry it out either what

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.770 
wouldn't want to dry it out either what
you'd<00:01:23.280> have<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.640> do<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:23.970> you'd<00:01:24.150> have<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.420> go<00:01:24.600> in

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
you'd have to do is you'd have to go in

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.950 
you'd have to do is you'd have to go in
through<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.259> bung<00:01:25.530> with<00:01:26.310> some<00:01:26.729> sort<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.330> of

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
through the bung with some sort of a of

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.260 
through the bung with some sort of a of
a<00:01:28.350> flame<00:01:28.710> that's<00:01:29.310> on<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:31.909> flexible<00:01:32.909> type<00:01:33.240> of

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
a flame that's on a flexible type of

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.109 
a flame that's on a flexible type of
head<00:01:33.860> I've<00:01:34.860> seen<00:01:35.159> them<00:01:35.340> before<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.729> haven't

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
head I've seen them before I haven't

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.690 
head I've seen them before I haven't
ever<00:01:36.210> tried<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:37.170> actually<00:01:37.560> reach<00:01:38.369> are

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
ever tried to actually reach are

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.060 
ever tried to actually reach are
especially<00:01:39.299> one<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.659> small<00:01:40.020> ones<00:01:40.070> it's

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
especially one of the small ones it's

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.370 
especially one of the small ones it's
usually<00:01:41.490> just<00:01:41.970> not<00:01:42.270> even<00:01:42.570> worth<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.780> effort

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
usually just not even worth the effort

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.499 
usually just not even worth the effort
it's<00:01:43.649> just<00:01:43.950> easier<00:01:44.399> just<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.820> buy<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.030> new<00:01:45.329> one

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
it's just easier just to buy a new one

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.090 
it's just easier just to buy a new one
the<00:01:46.290> larger<00:01:46.829> ones<00:01:47.070> though<00:01:47.369> can<00:01:48.180> be<00:01:48.210> done<00:01:48.920> so<00:01:49.920> if

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
the larger ones though can be done so if

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.350 
the larger ones though can be done so if
that's<00:01:50.250> something<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.759> you're<00:01:51.060> interested

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
that's something that you're interested

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.679 
that's something that you're interested
in<00:01:51.720> let<00:01:52.020> me<00:01:52.049> know<00:01:52.380> but<00:01:53.090> basically<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.299> can<00:01:54.479> see

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
in let me know but basically you can see

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.389 
in let me know but basically you can see
that<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:55.049> inside<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.829> barrel<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:57.290> charred

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
that the inside of the barrel is charred

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.270 
that the inside of the barrel is charred
white<00:01:59.399> American<00:02:00.000> oak<00:02:00.180> so<00:02:01.009> they're<00:02:02.009> really

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
white American oak so they're really
