coffee sales actually continued to grow
there<00:00:49.590> was<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.710> positive<00:00:49.950> price<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:50.520> asta

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
there was a positive price that asta

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.270 
there was a positive price that asta
City<00:00:51.000> but<00:00:51.539> this<00:00:51.660> was<00:00:51.840> only<00:00:51.989> true<00:00:52.110> for<00:00:52.949> one<00:00:53.129> of

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
City but this was only true for one of

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.010 
City but this was only true for one of
two<00:00:53.520> Fairtrade<00:00:54.000> certified<00:00:54.329> coffees<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:54.899> we

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
two Fairtrade certified coffees that we

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.639 
two Fairtrade certified coffees that we
tested<00:00:55.410> for<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.250> less<00:00:56.940> expensive<00:00:57.510> coffee<00:00:57.960> and

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
tested for the less expensive coffee and

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:59.959 
tested for the less expensive coffee and
the<00:00:59.010> sales<00:00:59.219> actually<00:00:59.460> decreased

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
the sales actually decreased

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.660 
the sales actually decreased
dramatically<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:02.070> suggests<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.579> us

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
dramatically and so that suggests to us

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.210 
dramatically and so that suggests to us
that<00:01:02.760> there's<00:01:03.149> two<00:01:03.870> segments<00:01:04.379> in<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.890> market

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
that there's two segments in the market

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.440 
that there's two segments in the market
there's<00:01:05.580> consumers<00:01:06.060> who<00:01:06.150> are<00:01:06.180> willing<00:01:06.330> to

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
there's consumers who are willing to

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.240 
there's consumers who are willing to
support<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:07.170> price<00:01:07.350> increases<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:08.070> come

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
support the price increases that come

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.950 
support the price increases that come
with<00:01:08.369> Fairtrade<00:01:08.700> certification<00:01:09.000> but<00:01:09.840> they're

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
with Fairtrade certification but they're

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.750 
with Fairtrade certification but they're
also<00:01:10.080> consumers<00:01:10.560> who<00:01:10.650> will<00:01:10.770> not<00:01:10.950> support<00:01:11.549> this

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
also consumers who will not support this

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.050 
also consumers who will not support this
and<00:01:12.510> they<00:01:12.689> know<00:01:12.810> it's<00:01:12.900> about<00:01:13.080> an<00:01:13.200> equal<00:01:13.470> split

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
and they know it's about an equal split

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.469 
and they know it's about an equal split
I<00:01:16.399> think<00:01:17.399> the<00:01:17.460> main<00:01:17.610> takeaway<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.180> their

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
I think the main takeaway is that their

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.450 
I think the main takeaway is that their
substantial<00:01:19.020> support<00:01:19.500> for<00:01:19.560> Fairtrade

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
substantial support for Fairtrade

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.999 
substantial support for Fairtrade
certification<00:01:20.820> in<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.479> marketplace<00:01:22.020> today

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
certification in the marketplace today

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.310 
certification in the marketplace today
but<00:01:23.700> it's<00:01:23.850> not<00:01:24.000> unlimited<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:24.960> think<00:01:25.079> there

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
but it's not unlimited so I think there

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.170 
but it's not unlimited so I think there
is<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.470> fair<00:01:25.799> segment<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.460> fairly<00:01:26.759> sizeable

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
is a fair segment a fairly sizeable

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.539 
is a fair segment a fairly sizeable
segment<00:01:27.539> that<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.500> not<00:01:28.799> willing<00:01:29.039> to<00:01:29.220> pay<00:01:29.340> more

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
segment that is not willing to pay more

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:30.830 
segment that is not willing to pay more
for<00:01:29.579> these<00:01:29.820> ethically<00:01:30.210> made<00:01:30.329> product<00:01:30.689> as<00:01:30.810> much

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
for these ethically made product as much

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.859 
for these ethically made product as much
as<00:01:31.110> we<00:01:31.259> might<00:01:31.380> want<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.830> but<00:01:32.700> there<00:01:32.850> are<00:01:33.030> like

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
as we might want to but there are like

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.389 
as we might want to but there are like
there<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.140> fair<00:01:34.439> they<00:01:34.740> lock<00:01:34.979> share<00:01:35.250> of

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
there is a fair they lock share of

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:36.710 
there is a fair they lock share of
consumers<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:35.850> are<00:01:36.119> willing<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.450> pay<00:01:36.570> more

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
consumers that are willing to pay more

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.789 
consumers that are willing to pay more
for<00:01:36.780> these<00:01:37.020> products<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.439> that's<00:01:37.500> something

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
for these products and that's something

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.730 
for these products and that's something
that<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.189> know<00:01:38.340> companies<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:39.030> think<00:01:39.590> can<00:01:40.590> take

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
that you know companies I think can take

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.020 
that you know companies I think can take
as<00:01:40.890> an<00:01:40.979> important<00:01:41.340> lesson<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.729> mean<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:41.970> think

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
as an important lesson I mean I think

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.880 
as an important lesson I mean I think

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
that this this gives you an opportunity

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.620 
that this this gives you an opportunity
to<00:01:44.189> differentiate<00:01:44.670> your<00:01:44.970> product<00:01:45.210> from<00:01:45.450> your

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
to differentiate your product from your

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.960 
to differentiate your product from your
competitors<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.829> really<00:01:47.039> like<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:47.880> know

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
competitors and to really like you know

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.749 
competitors and to really like you know
have<00:01:48.179> I<00:01:48.390> think<00:01:48.690> there<00:01:48.899> is<00:01:48.959> a<00:01:48.990> business<00:01:49.200> case

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
have I think there is a business case

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.130 
have I think there is a business case
for<00:01:50.759> these<00:01:51.030> ethical<00:01:51.450> differentiation

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
for these ethical differentiation

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.460 
for these ethical differentiation
schemes<00:01:52.440> where<00:01:52.880> you<00:01:53.880> basically<00:01:54.270> try<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.200> pass

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
schemes where you basically try to pass

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.770 
schemes where you basically try to pass
on<00:01:55.709> some<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:56.009> these<00:01:56.069> costs<00:01:56.640> for<00:01:57.000> ethically

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
on some of these costs for ethically

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.090 
on some of these costs for ethically
upgrading<00:01:58.229> your<00:01:58.319> supply<00:01:58.560> chains<00:01:58.830> to<00:01:58.920> the

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
upgrading your supply chains to the

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.190 
upgrading your supply chains to the
consumers<00:01:59.580> I<00:02:02.299> think<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.599> lesson<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:03.929> comes

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
consumers I think the lesson that comes

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.660 
consumers I think the lesson that comes
from<00:02:04.319> our<00:02:04.409> experiment<00:02:04.830> is<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:05.069> that<00:02:05.250> this<00:02:05.490> is

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
from our experiment is is that this is

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.889 
from our experiment is is that this is
something<00:02:05.849> that<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.209> should<00:02:06.240> look<00:02:06.689> into

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
something that you should look into

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.020 
something that you should look into
seriously<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:08.039> should<00:02:08.280> look<00:02:08.459> into<00:02:08.700> whether

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
seriously you should look into whether

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.550 
seriously you should look into whether
you<00:02:09.239> can<00:02:09.390> ethically<00:02:09.720> differentiate<00:02:10.410> your

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
you can ethically differentiate your

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.960 
you can ethically differentiate your
product<00:02:10.769> cuz<00:02:11.009> there<00:02:11.160> are<00:02:11.280> consumers<00:02:11.819> out

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
product cuz there are consumers out

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.640 
product cuz there are consumers out
there<00:02:12.180> depending<00:02:12.780> on<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.230> market<00:02:13.380> that

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
there depending on the market that

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.320 
there depending on the market that
you're<00:02:13.769> in<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:14.099> are<00:02:14.280> really<00:02:14.819> willing<00:02:15.000> to

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
you're in that are really willing to

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.479 
you're in that are really willing to
reward<00:02:15.660> you<00:02:16.019> and<00:02:16.170> who<00:02:16.890> might<00:02:17.069> on<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.310> other

reward you and who might on the other

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.069 
reward you and who might on the other
hand<00:02:17.670> punish<00:02:17.970> you<00:02:18.150> if<00:02:18.360> you<00:02:18.510> don't<00:02:18.660> go<00:02:18.900> down

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:19.079 
hand punish you if you don't go down

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:20.690 
hand punish you if you don't go down
this<00:02:19.260> road<00:02:19.470> it<00:02:19.680> might<00:02:19.829> be<00:02:19.950> singled<00:02:20.280> out<00:02:20.340> as<00:02:20.579> the

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
this road it might be singled out as the

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.640 
this road it might be singled out as the
company<00:02:21.090> that's<00:02:21.600> kind<00:02:21.810> of<00:02:21.840> left<00:02:22.049> behind<00:02:22.200> while

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
company that's kind of left behind while

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.470 
company that's kind of left behind while
other<00:02:22.829> new<00:02:22.980> competitors<00:02:23.519> are<00:02:23.760> ethically

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
other new competitors are ethically

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.930 
other new competitors are ethically
upgrading<00:02:25.019> you're<00:02:25.440> not<00:02:25.650> doing<00:02:25.920> that<00:02:26.070> and<00:02:26.310> and

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
upgrading you're not doing that and and

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.699 
upgrading you're not doing that and and
so<00:02:27.090> I<00:02:27.120> think<00:02:27.450> there's<00:02:27.600> a<00:02:27.660> risk<00:02:27.840> in<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.530> not

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
so I think there's a risk in to not

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.410 
so I think there's a risk in to not
considering<00:02:29.400> these<00:02:29.549> schemes<00:02:29.880> into<00:02:30.269> not

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
considering these schemes into not

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.599 
considering these schemes into not
thinking<00:02:30.810> about<00:02:31.019> you<00:02:31.560> know<00:02:31.680> what<00:02:31.859> can<00:02:32.040> I<00:02:32.130> do<00:02:32.190> to

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:32.609 
thinking about you know what can I do to

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:35.509 
thinking about you know what can I do to
produce<00:02:33.239> my<00:02:33.569> products<00:02:34.140> in<00:02:34.500> a<00:02:35.010> way<00:02:35.160> that<00:02:35.400> it's

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
produce my products in a way that it's

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:36.890 
produce my products in a way that it's
environmentally<00:02:35.910> more<00:02:36.239> friendly<00:02:36.630> that<00:02:36.840> is

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
environmentally more friendly that is

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.539 
environmentally more friendly that is
sort<00:02:37.140> of<00:02:37.170> ethically<00:02:37.620> more<00:02:37.769> sustainable<00:02:38.400> and

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
sort of ethically more sustainable and

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.430 
sort of ethically more sustainable and
that<00:02:38.609> has<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:39.480> better<00:02:39.690> impact<00:02:40.079> on<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.319> planet

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
that has a better impact on the planet
