00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
what you know is very fascinating the

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.000 
what you know is very fascinating the
amount<00:00:38.040> of<00:00:38.159> songs<00:00:38.820> which<00:00:39.000> are<00:00:39.120> there<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:40.010> both

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
amount of songs which are there and both

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.399 
amount of songs which are there and both
of<00:00:41.190> them<00:00:41.370> kind<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.820> culminated<00:00:42.720> we<00:00:42.900> said<00:00:43.079> why

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:43.409 
of them kind of culminated we said why

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:47.130 
of them kind of culminated we said why
don't<00:00:43.470> we<00:00:43.620> do<00:00:43.829> something<00:00:44.070> which<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.839> mix<00:00:45.839> of

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
don't we do something which is a mix of

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.220 
don't we do something which is a mix of
visuals<00:00:48.140> and<00:00:48.410> songs<00:00:49.030> combining<00:00:50.030> this<00:00:50.149> poetry

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.819 

so<00:00:53.980> his<00:00:54.190> songs<00:00:54.730> were<00:00:55.000> more<00:00:55.300> about<00:00:55.660> life<00:00:56.289> more

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:56.829 
so his songs were more about life more

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.790 
so his songs were more about life more
about<00:00:58.620> pain

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.030 

desires<00:01:03.800> and<00:01:04.010> all<00:01:04.070> the<00:01:04.250> stuff<00:01:04.489> so

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.010 

I<00:01:07.070> was<00:01:08.060> thinking<00:01:08.330> it<00:01:08.450> would<00:01:08.540> be<00:01:08.570> a<00:01:08.690> great

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
I was thinking it would be a great

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.640 
I was thinking it would be a great
opportunity<00:01:09.260> to<00:01:09.710> go<00:01:09.860> to<00:01:09.890> a<00:01:10.130> space<00:01:10.460> where

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
opportunity to go to a space where

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.220 
opportunity to go to a space where
things<00:01:12.650> are<00:01:12.800> more<00:01:12.920> slow<00:01:13.220> down<00:01:13.460> and<00:01:14.080> not<00:01:15.080> in

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:15.230 
things are more slow down and not in

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.890 
things are more slow down and not in
this<00:01:15.320> rapid<00:01:15.740> pace<00:01:15.980> of<00:01:16.190> what<00:01:16.850> we<00:01:17.090> are<00:01:17.120> in<00:01:17.750> our

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900

ramírez whole new experience I actually
personally<00:02:38.969> like<00:02:39.299> Ibiza<00:02:40.489> because<00:02:41.489> it's<00:02:41.670> not<00:02:42.180> a

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
personally like Ibiza because it's not a

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.479 
personally like Ibiza because it's not a
very<00:02:42.299> conventional<00:02:42.750> tune<00:02:43.349> but<00:02:44.129> I<00:02:44.189> think

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
very conventional tune but I think

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.089 
very conventional tune but I think
what's<00:02:45.239> happened<00:02:45.689> is<00:02:45.840> when<00:02:46.409> you<00:02:46.560> combine

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
what's happened is when you combine

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.949 
what's happened is when you combine
these<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.790> student<00:02:48.180> with<00:02:48.269> this<00:02:48.390> visual<00:02:48.810> they

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
these the student with this visual they

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.380 
these the student with this visual they
feel<00:02:49.170> in<00:02:49.769> certain<00:02:50.430> parts<00:02:50.879> of<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.120> video

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
feel in certain parts of the video

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.200 
feel in certain parts of the video
there's<00:02:51.720> some<00:02:51.870> magic
