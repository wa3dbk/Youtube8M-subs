00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:41.919 
back and forth and it's really hard just

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:43.319 
back and forth and it's really hard just
to<00:03:42.040> get<00:03:42.159> these<00:03:42.310> guys<00:03:42.549> to<00:03:42.759> go<00:03:42.879> on<00:03:42.909> a<00:03:43.030> straight

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
to get these guys to go on a straight

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:47.189 
to get these guys to go on a straight
line<00:03:43.409> if<00:03:44.409> they<00:03:44.620> have<00:03:44.739> these<00:03:44.919> tabs<00:03:46.049> like<00:03:47.049> the

line if they have these tabs like the

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:51.719 
line if they have these tabs like the
lumagrowl<00:03:47.620> has<00:03:47.919> a<00:03:47.949> tab<00:03:48.280> like<00:03:48.459> that<00:03:48.699> too<00:03:50.729> so

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:51.729
