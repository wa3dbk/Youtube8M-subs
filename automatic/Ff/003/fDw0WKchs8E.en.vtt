remove this basically this is going to
be<00:06:37.219> your<00:06:37.370> left<00:06:37.550> side<00:06:38.169> right<00:06:39.169> side<00:06:39.229> like<00:06:39.710> so<00:06:39.979> you

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:40.039 
be your left side right side like so you

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:41.499 
be your left side right side like so you
can<00:06:40.310> see<00:06:40.460> this<00:06:40.550> is<00:06:40.669> kind<00:06:40.849> of<00:06:40.909> a<00:06:40.969> medium<00:06:41.300> density

00:06:41.499 --> 00:06:41.509
