solve<00:00:30.290> the<00:00:30.500> gelatin<00:00:30.950> with<00:00:31.099> the<00:00:31.220> half<00:00:31.400> a<00:00:31.489> cup<00:00:31.669> of

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
solve the gelatin with the half a cup of

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.510 
solve the gelatin with the half a cup of
cold<00:00:32.000> water<00:00:32.090> just<00:00:33.010> sprinkle<00:00:34.010> a<00:00:34.130> little<00:00:34.370> at<00:00:34.489> a

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
cold water just sprinkle a little at a

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.450 
cold water just sprinkle a little at a
time<00:00:34.670> until<00:00:34.940> it<00:00:35.360> dissolves<00:00:36.260> then<00:00:36.980> once<00:00:37.310> it's

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
time until it dissolves then once it's

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.790 
time until it dissolves then once it's
dissolved<00:00:37.550> suddenly<00:00:38.210> sprinkle<00:00:38.600> more<00:00:38.810> on<00:00:39.500> top

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
dissolved suddenly sprinkle more on top

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.650 
dissolved suddenly sprinkle more on top
until<00:00:40.070> until<00:00:40.850> all<00:00:41.239> the<00:00:41.750> gelatin<00:00:41.960> dissolve

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
until until all the gelatin dissolve

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.349 
until until all the gelatin dissolve
then<00:00:44.660> you<00:00:45.109> said<00:00:45.320> it<00:00:45.460> better<00:00:46.460> the<00:00:46.699> side<00:00:46.940> for<00:00:47.210> 5

00:00:47.349 --> 00:00:47.359 
then you said it better the side for 5

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:56.369 
then you said it better the side for 5
minutes

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.279 

after<00:00:57.129> the<00:00:57.219> five<00:00:57.430> minute<00:00:57.879> tested<00:00:58.329> the<00:00:58.690> gelatin

00:00:59.279 --> 00:00:59.289 
after the five minute tested the gelatin

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:02.279 
after the five minute tested the gelatin
has<00:00:59.559> dissolved<00:01:00.000> put<00:01:01.000> the<00:01:01.149> gelatin<00:01:01.390> into<00:01:01.870> the

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:02.289 
has dissolved put the gelatin into the

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:06.090 
has dissolved put the gelatin into the
hot<00:01:02.559> water<00:01:03.330> so<00:01:04.330> until<00:01:04.750> it<00:01:04.900> melts<00:01:05.409> you<00:01:05.650> can<00:01:05.830> you

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
hot water so until it melts you can you

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:13.860 
hot water so until it melts you can you
can<00:01:06.250> watch<00:01:06.460> it<00:01:06.670> melts<00:01:07.119> and<00:01:07.360> it<00:01:07.509> dissolves

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.680 

so<00:01:14.870> the<00:01:15.050> cut<00:01:15.260> the<00:01:15.560> complete<00:01:16.220> and<00:01:16.520> looks<00:01:16.940> clumpy

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
so the cut the complete and looks clumpy

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.410 
so the cut the complete and looks clumpy
but<00:01:17.960> at<00:01:18.560> once<00:01:18.860> it<00:01:19.100> hits<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:19.490> hot<00:01:19.700> water<00:01:19.970> it

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
but at once it hits the hot water it

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:27.710 
but at once it hits the hot water it
will<00:01:20.690> turn<00:01:21.020> to<00:01:21.710> liquidy

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.740 

so<00:01:28.200> up<00:01:28.290> with<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:29.160> can<00:01:29.540> dissolve<00:01:30.540> the

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
so up with that you can dissolve the

00:01:30.750 --> 00:02:09.930 
so up with that you can dissolve the
sugar<00:01:30.780> into<00:01:31.440> the<00:01:31.560> hot<00:01:31.710> water

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.699 

someone<00:02:10.940> slept<00:02:11.150> gelatin<00:02:11.600> sugar<00:02:11.900> mixture<00:02:12.530> has

someone slept gelatin sugar mixture has

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.170 
someone slept gelatin sugar mixture has
dissolve<00:02:14.410> in<00:02:15.410> a<00:02:15.620> large<00:02:15.860> bowl<00:02:16.250> mix<00:02:16.520> the<00:02:16.910> coconut

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
dissolve in a large bowl mix the coconut

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.120 
dissolve in a large bowl mix the coconut
milk<00:02:17.750> and<00:02:17.959> the<00:02:18.230> gelatin<00:02:18.590> together

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.090 

after<00:02:24.000> that<00:02:24.180> allow<00:02:24.900> it<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.320> cool<00:02:25.830> to<00:02:25.860> room

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
after that allow it to cool to room

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.600 
after that allow it to cool to room
temperature<00:02:26.900> after<00:02:27.900> -<00:02:28.050> after<00:02:28.620> it<00:02:29.010> cools<00:02:29.280> but

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
temperature after - after it cools but

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.260

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:52.960 
in the refrigerator for about 15 to 20
minutes<00:02:33.570> until<00:02:33.750> it<00:02:34.080> sets<00:02:34.380> a<00:02:34.710> little<00:02:35.520> bit

we<00:02:57.500> can<00:02:57.650> now<00:02:57.860> whip<00:02:58.160> the<00:02:58.190> whipping<00:02:58.730> cream<00:03:02.020> so

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
we can now whip the whipping cream so

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.440 
we can now whip the whipping cream so
we'll<00:03:03.230> whip<00:03:03.530> it<00:03:03.680> until<00:03:03.860> it<00:03:04.370> reach<00:03:04.820> to<00:03:05.120> soft

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
we'll whip it until it reach to soft

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:14.940 
we'll whip it until it reach to soft
peak

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.089 

so<00:03:15.520> when<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:15.849> mixture<00:03:16.209> begins<00:03:16.390> to<00:03:16.720> set<00:03:17.170> we<00:03:17.890> can

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
so when the mixture begins to set we can

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:22.410 
so when the mixture begins to set we can
now<00:03:18.310> hold<00:03:18.640> in<00:03:19.000> the<00:03:19.330> whipping<00:03:19.720> cream<00:03:21.150> so<00:03:22.150> if<00:03:22.209> you

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
now hold in the whipping cream so if you

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.570 
now hold in the whipping cream so if you
want<00:03:22.750> your<00:03:23.050> pudding<00:03:23.410> to<00:03:23.770> be<00:03:23.920> more<00:03:24.190> light<00:03:26.580> you

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
want your pudding to be more light you

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.990 
want your pudding to be more light you
should<00:03:27.910> allow<00:03:28.750> your<00:03:29.140> mixture<00:03:29.530> to<00:03:29.890> step<00:03:30.310> longer

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
should allow your mixture to step longer

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.449 
should allow your mixture to step longer
if<00:03:31.180> you<00:03:31.239> don't<00:03:31.510> want<00:03:31.840> it<00:03:31.930> to<00:03:32.170> light<00:03:32.530> then<00:03:33.040> allow

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
if you don't want it to light then allow

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:33.840 
if you don't want it to light then allow
it

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
it

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:52.950 
it
don't<00:03:34.180> don't<00:03:34.780> allow<00:03:35.140> it<00:03:35.290> to<00:03:35.319> set<00:03:35.650> too<00:03:35.980> long

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:52.960 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.460 

so<00:03:53.960> it's<00:03:54.140> best<00:03:54.470> to<00:03:54.680> use<00:03:54.890> a<00:03:55.400> whip<00:03:55.700> to<00:03:56.170> fold<00:03:57.170> in

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
so it's best to use a whip to fold in

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.590 
so it's best to use a whip to fold in
your<00:03:57.500> whipping<00:03:58.010> cream<00:03:58.280> that<00:03:58.730> allows<00:03:59.210> it<00:03:59.570> to

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
your whipping cream that allows it to

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:29.020 
your whipping cream that allows it to
put<00:04:00.140> more<00:04:00.530> air<00:04:00.890> into<00:04:01.460> the<00:04:01.760> body

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.960 

so<00:04:29.750> once<00:04:29.960> everything<00:04:30.500> is<00:04:30.620> mixed<00:04:30.949> you<00:04:31.520> can

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
so once everything is mixed you can

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.779 
so once everything is mixed you can
transfer<00:04:32.569> it<00:04:32.599> into<00:04:32.810> a<00:04:33.020> dish<00:04:33.349> and<00:04:33.789> refrigerate

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:34.789 
transfer it into a dish and refrigerate

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:51.510 
transfer it into a dish and refrigerate
it<00:04:35.030> until<00:04:35.210> it's<00:04:35.750> set

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.510 

so<00:04:52.000> there<00:04:52.210> you<00:04:52.240> have<00:04:52.419> it<00:04:52.810> voila<00:04:53.560> cotton

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
so there you have it voila cotton

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.320 
so there you have it voila cotton
coconut<00:04:55.120> pudding
