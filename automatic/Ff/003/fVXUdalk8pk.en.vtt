I have learned so much from from the

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.520 
I have learned so much from from the
basic<00:00:55.739> things<00:00:56.010> in<00:00:56.280> in<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:57.000> AC<00:00:57.180> system<00:00:57.629> but<00:00:58.050> one

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
basic things in in the AC system but one

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.819 
basic things in in the AC system but one
one<00:00:59.219> one<00:00:59.820> important<00:01:00.420> thing<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:00.960> really

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
one one important thing that I really

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.579 
one one important thing that I really
learned<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.550> art<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:03.030> goal-setting<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:03.899> I

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
think that goal-setting is very

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.140 
think that goal-setting is very
important<00:01:07.049> for<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.260> student<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:08.040> not<00:01:08.670> only<00:01:09.000> for

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
important for a student and not only for

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.600
