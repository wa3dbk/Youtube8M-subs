00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
and as you can see the Rue night bulb

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.560 
and as you can see the Rue night bulb
and<00:01:27.399> the<00:01:27.490> broad<00:01:27.729> world<00:01:27.970> are<00:01:28.119> exactly

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
and the broad world are exactly

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.120 
and the broad world are exactly
equivalent<00:01:28.930> in<00:01:29.260> terms<00:01:29.350> of<00:01:29.560> damage<00:01:29.890> and<00:01:30.010> the

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
equivalent in terms of damage and the

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.520 
equivalent in terms of damage and the
broad<00:01:31.090> arrow<00:01:31.299> is<00:01:31.630> actually<00:01:31.990> better<00:01:32.170> than<00:01:32.290> the

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
broad arrow is actually better than the

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.530 
broad arrow is actually better than the
rune<00:01:32.680> arrow<00:01:32.920> so<00:01:33.640> if<00:01:33.970> you're<00:01:34.150> going<00:01:34.360> to<00:01:34.420> be

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
rune arrow so if you're going to be

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.000 
rune arrow so if you're going to be
ranging<00:01:34.869> I<00:01:34.960> recommend<00:01:35.350> not<00:01:35.440> using<00:01:35.500> the<00:01:35.830> rude

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.010 
ranging I recommend not using the rude

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.109 
ranging I recommend not using the rude
ones<00:01:36.190> and<00:01:36.369> just<00:01:36.520> using<00:01:36.820> the<00:01:36.880> really

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
ones and just using the really

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.960 
ones and just using the really
inexpensive<00:01:37.659> broad<00:01:37.840> ones<00:01:38.490> next<00:01:39.490> is<00:01:39.610> something

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
inexpensive broad ones next is something

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.460
