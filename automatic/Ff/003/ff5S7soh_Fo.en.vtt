it's a seven to one gear ratio I thought

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.749 
it's a seven to one gear ratio I thought
I<00:01:25.899> was<00:01:25.990> gonna<00:01:26.079> ask<00:01:26.289> for<00:01:26.680> six<00:01:26.890> to<00:01:27.009> three<00:01:27.159> because

cool about this is I'm it's not like

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:07.319 
cool about this is I'm it's not like
you're<00:02:04.799> like<00:02:05.799> normal<00:02:06.429> magnetic<00:02:07.119> braking

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329 
you're like normal magnetic braking

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:10.800 
you're like normal magnetic braking
system<00:02:07.780> pizza<00:02:08.049> acs<00:02:08.979> system<00:02:09.369> it's<00:02:09.610> it's<00:02:09.970> like<00:02:10.780> a

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
system pizza acs system it's it's like a

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.660 
system pizza acs system it's it's like a
friction<00:02:11.319> it<00:02:11.470> doesn't<00:02:11.739> use<00:02:11.890> magnetic<00:02:12.220> its

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
friction it doesn't use magnetic its

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.670 
friction it doesn't use magnetic its
uses<00:02:13.360> friction<00:02:13.510> here's<00:02:14.500> max<00:02:15.180> then<00:02:16.180> there's

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
uses friction here's max then there's

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.160 
uses friction here's max then there's
that's<00:02:17.680> no<00:02:17.950> that's<00:02:18.190> free<00:02:18.519> free<00:02:18.970> spool<00:02:19.209> and

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
that's no that's free free spool and

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.080 
that's no that's free free spool and
just<00:02:20.410> poor<00:02:20.769> choices<00:02:21.010> and<00:02:21.310> you<00:02:21.430> can<00:02:21.519> even<00:02:21.700> I

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
just poor choices and you can even I

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.940 
just poor choices and you can even I
don't<00:02:22.599> know<00:02:22.660> if<00:02:22.780> I<00:02:22.840> can<00:02:22.900> do<00:02:23.079> it<00:02:23.110> now<00:02:23.260> might<00:02:23.799> take

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
don't know if I can do it now might take

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.879 
don't know if I can do it now might take
a<00:02:24.010> little<00:02:24.190> bit<00:02:28.200> that's<00:02:29.200> how<00:02:29.350> pop<00:02:29.590> just<00:02:29.799> a

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:29.889 
a little bit that's how pop just a

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:31.680 
a little bit that's how pop just a
little<00:02:30.040> lever<00:02:30.220> you<00:02:31.090> know<00:02:31.150> you<00:02:31.269> just<00:02:31.359> get<00:02:31.569> in

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
little lever you know you just get in

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.289 
little lever you know you just get in
there<00:02:31.840> and<00:02:32.639> this<00:02:33.639> is<00:02:33.790> like<00:02:33.910> where<00:02:34.060> you<00:02:34.180> can

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
there and this is like where you can

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:35.940 
there and this is like where you can
even<00:02:34.510> change<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:34.870> bearings<00:02:35.260> if<00:02:35.680> you<00:02:35.769> want<00:02:35.889> to

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
even change the bearings if you want to

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.879 
even change the bearings if you want to
put<00:02:36.040> new<00:02:36.160> bearings<00:02:36.430> so<00:02:36.750> that's<00:02:37.799> pretty<00:02:38.799> cool

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:38.889 
put new bearings so that's pretty cool

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:43.530 
put new bearings so that's pretty cool
little<00:02:39.489> device<00:02:39.700> how<00:02:40.239> did<00:02:40.359> it<00:02:40.420> works<00:02:42.389> all<00:02:43.389> right

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
little device how did it works all right

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.819 
little device how did it works all right
i'll<00:02:43.780> put<00:02:43.959> that<00:02:43.989> back<00:02:44.230> in<00:02:44.350> a<00:02:44.410> second<00:02:44.650> just

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
i'll put that back in a second just

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:46.650 
i'll put that back in a second just
click<00:02:45.010> it<00:02:45.040> in<00:02:45.190> but<00:02:45.400> that's<00:02:46.180> pretty<00:02:46.329> much<00:02:46.420> my

talk<00:02:58.269> about<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:58.840> line<00:02:59.459> just<00:03:00.459> this<00:03:01.060> is<00:03:01.180> why<00:03:01.299> I

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
talk about the line just this is why I

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:02.550 
talk about the line just this is why I
got<00:03:01.480> four<00:03:01.720> jigs<00:03:01.959> I<00:03:02.079> think<00:03:02.230> it's<00:03:02.319> pretty<00:03:02.440> good

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
got four jigs I think it's pretty good

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.960 
got four jigs I think it's pretty good
for<00:03:02.680> deep<00:03:02.950> bar<00:03:03.100> Arizona<00:03:03.549> would<00:03:03.639> have<00:03:03.790> much

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
for deep bar Arizona would have much

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.020 
for deep bar Arizona would have much
structure<00:03:04.269> so<00:03:05.069> it's<00:03:06.069> fluorocarbon<00:03:06.730> coated

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
structure so it's fluorocarbon coated

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.460 
structure so it's fluorocarbon coated
your<00:03:07.569> good<00:03:07.660> thing<00:03:07.810> as<00:03:07.900> I<00:03:07.959> can<00:03:08.109> use<00:03:08.230> this<00:03:08.319> for
