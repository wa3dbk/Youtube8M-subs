now what exactly they do these numbers
mean<00:00:23.630> well<00:00:24.630> for<00:00:24.900> that<00:00:24.990> we're<00:00:25.140> gonna<00:00:25.199> have<00:00:25.380> to

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
mean well for that we're gonna have to

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.250 
mean well for that we're gonna have to
go<00:00:25.619> back<00:00:25.800> in<00:00:25.949> time<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.189> little<00:00:26.460> bit<00:00:27.019> back<00:00:28.019> in

dramatic difference between say the GTX
670<00:05:01.810> and<00:05:02.350> 770<00:05:03.510> now<00:05:04.510> I<00:05:04.539> personally<00:05:05.139> hope<00:05:05.650> that

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 
670 and 770 now I personally hope that

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:07.920 
670 and 770 now I personally hope that

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
they do switch it up as is a new

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.500 
they do switch it up as is a new
generation<00:05:08.830> so<00:05:09.430> it<00:05:09.700> should<00:05:09.880> have<00:05:10.030> a<00:05:10.090> new<00:05:10.270> look

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
generation so it should have a new look

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.870 
generation so it should have a new look
