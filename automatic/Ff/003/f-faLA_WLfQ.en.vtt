00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:27.500
 first hymn to tan on if possible a 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:32.369
 camera quite light and not very round 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:35.219
 after that so that's the main thing for 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.940
 a sin is not very long between them 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:43.739

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:46.829
 to walk on the river or what 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:51.839
 whether because it's even 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:57.780

00:00:51.839 --> 00:01:00.119

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:05.340
 worn then I advise you ingested 

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:09.290
 as here where with lots of pockets 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:12.930
 before orange is clear the only 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:28.240
 when I go to you 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:32.410
 with a hook this is an example for 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:36.270
 know right after the task at the cost 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:40.560
 because it's always check if the 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:44.740
 ceiling if the house you see there 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.340
 is very good for another for a 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.030
 other fishing 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:52.240

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.520
 worries then that siglÃ© buffet his 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.460
 base in europe 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.680
 it means that the hook is not 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:10.330
 reusable 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:19.150
