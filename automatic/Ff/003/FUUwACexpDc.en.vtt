00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.830
 seven trouble friends saliva will show you 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.200
 some cool moments as well 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.790
 finally one moment with face miles 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.550
 which all require 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.470
 I finally downloaded the cheat thanks to everyone 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.890
 turns out to be sharpening which works on 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.029
 ordinary last varnish works on 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.430
 addition i mean i have a pirate 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.009
 add-ons and pirate look as of course 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.020
 but it works like that 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.390
 out of ordinary autlast this is very cool 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.610
 Now we have something I will show you what I 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.460
 among managed to see from the face miles 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.520
 also one joke show first show with 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.470
 these warriors, well, that is, these 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.930
 dudes show what is opaque what 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.360
 no way to go is impossible well for that 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.070
 I think everyone understands the release pass 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.750
 more will be needed 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.290
 pause for now though okay 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:01.950
 see through come on faster 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:04.829
 President for me from the button that is down 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.140
 C grade and 

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:09.000
 from foam laptops there it was easier 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.580
 immediately two buttons at once Asian 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.450
 threesome for 0 scream so let's get here 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.150
 Such a shichko thing about all understood I not these 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.830
 I pressed the buttons is not with me 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.140
 almost near the arrows on 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.360
 We wear the keyboard here and here we allow 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.820
 will be a window 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.070
 where the sound is not as irritable as in 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.080
 tom coach but it's very good here 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.909
 run and again I restarted from here 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.340
 locations see my tanker 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:44.280
 teleport to them and here they are 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:47.040
 transparent with and do not shoot at all 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:51.229
 do not shoot but such times of luxury 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.229
 growth as a park is about the same 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.820
 now one will go here for further 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.439
 here it is now give it impossible for some reason 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.690
 that is, I can go no further 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:05.960
 I know why I donâ€™t jump 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:09.350
 I can not go here, I will be nothing 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.360
 this iodine is down but there probably i am 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.340
 showed laptops I after now fall 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.170
 there you can fall through the texture 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.110
 so I will not go anywhere but here 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.300
 here you can see here numer trick 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.120
 in short but this is not the most important hour we 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.520
 show the face of miles on my channel features 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.610
 take it even in gods will not show here 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.040
 it is here that show it so again I 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.410
 here to see us miles i 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.209
 I think many know about the good of they know 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:41.269
 and they'll come to my channel like that 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:43.430
 here we put a point here we go well that is 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:47.690
 it is not clear yes we go sit down and 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:49.700
 then it went back and page down 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.220
 now of course there will be a cool video 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.380
 at least in the fact that we will still be through 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.950
 all go will hang in the air go 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:00.079
 go with you approaching the door 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:06.620
 cook cool and without camera 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:08.350
 By the way, too cool where did he put 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.500
 this invisible camera 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:17.050
 probably attacked 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:21.630
 how is he going now we will drive up 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:24.100
 mail is worth and teleport back 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:30.370
 we must now appear on the spot if 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:31.990
 I did not confuse anything well here we are 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:38.970
 all we can now contemplate 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:41.980
 miles's face it 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.440
 Yes, on a computer, it's better than a vidos on a laptop 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.590
 then straight on at the earliest is all 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:53.500
 the skywalker sky remains like this 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:56.920
 this is me this is yes and well 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.980
 a little bit like even a little bit 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.980
 very similar to what the game files were 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.560
 that is, the head that served exactly 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:09.700
 for the shadows but no one knows that 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.980
 Velma. exactly the same head 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.000
 that he has exactly the same as Maza 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.910
 texture only 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.310
 textures of the arms and legs and other things 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.890
 changed the head is the most think 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:24.280
 it was necessary to do something new they what 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:26.800
 make yes it seems that miles is miles 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.080
 Wanted that he had no fingers 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.070
 although I can make them dust him 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:35.530
 the rest he does not have them on the plot 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:38.430
 the jeans are the same then he is the walrieder that is 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:43.180
 miles driven name at a distance 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:45.490
 grow and that car was not sure what was there 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.590
 does exactly can be inside this 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.840
 machines they somehow put something 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:53.220
 tell but at least I don't 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:56.680
 I see him somewhere there somewhere around here 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.510
 shouldn't come in some building we 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.550
 I donâ€™t understand them where they can 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.640
 will need to be figured out later 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:06.040
 but in general, the main thing is not that I 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.900
 I showed you everything I wanted to thank you all 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.820
 for viewing if you like it 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.190
 Like put prokomentiruyte as well as 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.800
 subscribe articles this is generally perfect 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:18.520
 there is no go oasis but the risk 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:21.090
 real magic comes all come together and 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:24.210
 outlast whistleblower 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:27.500
 that there is something that there is something and lured 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.500
 here here
