 gernot kuwait and today it goes to 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.900
 we use the cold season 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.360
 Something about our houseplants 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.220
 to do good 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.080
 From time to time we should be ours 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.700
 Zimmerplatz give new ground and thus 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.550
 to supply fresh nutrients 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.470
 It is also important that the 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.989
 respective plant also the right one 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.390
 substrate gets classic 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.059
 indoor plants like the ficus benjamini 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.010
 or the sport's filling is enough 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.640
 simple indoor plants substrate that in 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.719
 get your specialty shop 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.579
 This is already the right one 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.949
 ingredients mixed together and 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.569
 just enough for a large part of our 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:55.890
 indoor plants while repotting themselves 

00:00:53.569 --> 00:01:00.989
 Choose one to two and number 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:06.780
 larger new pot fill this 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:08.909
 then ground covered with earth take 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:13.910
 now the old plant out of her head 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.910
 out lure the roots felt 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.080
 to fill the new pot 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.080
 all around with the fresh earth 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.110
 It is important that one with the fingers on 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.740
 rand beautiful purely does not press it 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.740
 cavities arise 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.140
 finished only now more cast and the 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.820
 Plant can grow again 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.399
 something looks different with cactus and 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.490
 Succulents from these need a lot 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:52.579
 permeable substrate that with more sand 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.020
 share is mixed special

 grow naturally in the trees 

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:03.679
 they really only feed on 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.700
 the air roots of which they the 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:09.459
 humidity absorb the water 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:14.209
 if you want to repot these plants 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:19.549
 Take the breaks and remove them now 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:22.280
 the old pot drops the old substral 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:25.849
 mostly by itself and down 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.349

 on the very air is permeable 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.569
 while repotting themselves, they are similar 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.760
 before filling as in the indoor plants 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.760

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.180
