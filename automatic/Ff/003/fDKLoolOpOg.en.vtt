00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:20.480 
hi my name is Rasmus and I'm here
reviewing<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:16.430> 1923<00:00:17.600> herring<00:00:18.600> winter<00:00:19.020> chop

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
reviewing the 1923 herring winter chop

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.130 
reviewing the 1923 herring winter chop
it's<00:00:21.210> I<00:00:21.420> got<00:00:21.900> this<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:22.740> think<00:00:23.010> it's<00:00:23.130> pear

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
it's I got this I think it's pear

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.140 
it's I got this I think it's pear
pudding<00:00:25.140> home<00:00:25.519> a<00:00:26.519> very<00:00:27.269> distinctive<00:00:28.050> and

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
pudding home a very distinctive and

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.550 
pudding home a very distinctive and
instrument<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.240> play<00:00:30.359> because<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:30.960> really

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
instrument to play because you really

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.950 
instrument to play because you really
feel<00:00:31.769> that<00:00:31.800> it's<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.520> great<00:00:32.969> bit<00:00:33.510> different

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
feel that it's a great bit different

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.490 
feel that it's a great bit different
from<00:00:34.020> other<00:00:34.280> homologous<00:00:35.280> because<00:00:35.640> of<00:00:35.790> the

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
from other homologous because of the

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.850 
from other homologous because of the
brightness<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.040> reeds<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.989> had<00:00:40.410> I<00:00:40.680> would

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
brightness of the reeds I had I would

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.010 
brightness of the reeds I had I would
compare<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.430> another<00:00:41.460> wooden<00:00:42.360> harmonica

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
compare it to another wooden harmonica

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:50.200 
compare it to another wooden harmonica
but<00:00:44.989> if<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.170> see<00:00:46.430> is<00:00:47.930> roughly<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.079> same<00:00:49.260> size

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
but if you see is roughly the same size

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.660 
but if you see is roughly the same size
the<00:00:51.210> herring<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.719> tiny<00:00:52.260> bit<00:00:52.440> wider<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.340> tiny

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
the herring is a tiny bit wider a tiny

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.139 
the herring is a tiny bit wider a tiny
tiny<00:00:53.940> bit<00:00:54.649> they<00:00:55.649> got<00:00:55.800> kind<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.879> same

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
tiny bit they got kind of the same

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.229 
tiny bit they got kind of the same
structure<00:00:57.629> which<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.680> quite<00:00:59.300> nice<00:01:00.300> too<00:01:00.719> and

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
structure which is quite nice too and

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.020 
structure which is quite nice too and
the<00:01:03.239> thing<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.600> about<00:01:04.080> these<00:01:04.290> hops<00:01:04.589> but<00:01:05.430> as<00:01:06.000> I

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
the thing is about these hops but as I

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.789 
the thing is about these hops but as I
said<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.330> have<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.570> wider<00:01:07.700> broader<00:01:09.500> set<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.530> reeds

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
said I have a wider broader set of reeds

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.289 
said I have a wider broader set of reeds
so<00:01:11.280> it's<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.520> bit<00:01:11.700> hard<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.060> blow<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:13.549> so<00:01:14.549> but<00:01:15.270> I

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
so it's a bit hard to blow and so but I

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.910 
so it's a bit hard to blow and so but I
think<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.990> heard<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.259> they<00:01:16.560> should<00:01:16.740> hold

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
think I heard that they should hold

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.340 
think I heard that they should hold
longer<00:01:17.520> I'm<00:01:17.850> not<00:01:18.030> quite<00:01:18.270> sure<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.509> can't<00:01:18.960> verify

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
longer I'm not quite sure I can't verify

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.450 
longer I'm not quite sure I can't verify
this<00:01:19.619> but<00:01:20.610> then<00:01:21.030> they<00:01:21.450> are<00:01:21.479> supposed<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.930> do<00:01:22.080> so

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
this but then they are supposed to do so

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.520 
this but then they are supposed to do so
so<00:01:23.460> this<00:01:24.119> one<00:01:24.299> is<00:01:24.390> an<00:01:24.509> e<00:01:24.720> as<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.170> heard<00:01:25.320> it's<00:01:25.470> a

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
so this one is an e as you heard it's a

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.249 
so this one is an e as you heard it's a
bit<00:01:25.680> high<00:01:26.159> mid<00:01:27.000> tone<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.420> only<00:01:27.659> have<00:01:27.869> one<00:01:28.020> an<00:01:28.140> e

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
bit high mid tone I only have one an e

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.249 
bit high mid tone I only have one an e
you<00:01:28.290> haven't<00:01:28.650> bought<00:01:28.829> any<00:01:29.070> more<00:01:29.250> because<00:01:29.790> I

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
you haven't bought any more because I

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.109 
you haven't bought any more because I
really<00:01:31.259> don't<00:01:31.439> like<00:01:31.829> this<00:01:32.340> harmonica<00:01:32.670> that

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
really don't like this harmonica that

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:33.620 
really don't like this harmonica that
much

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
much

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.630 
much
usually<00:01:34.320> when<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:34.470> review<00:01:34.890> come<00:01:35.130> on<00:01:35.250> guess<00:01:35.490> I'm

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
usually when I review come on guess I'm

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.940 
usually when I review come on guess I'm
like<00:01:35.820> yeah<00:01:36.299> everything's<00:01:36.810> great<00:01:37.079> this<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.799> one

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
like yeah everything's great this is one

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.679 
like yeah everything's great this is one
that<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.189> could<00:01:38.340> use<00:01:38.579> all<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.909> time<00:01:39.060> but<00:01:39.600> this

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
that you could use all the time but this

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.859 
that you could use all the time but this
one<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:39.960> would<00:01:40.290> be<00:01:40.470> most<00:01:41.509> if<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.689> want

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
one I would be most if you want

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.010 
one I would be most if you want
something<00:01:43.200> more<00:01:43.579> specifically<00:01:44.579> like<00:01:45.570> this<00:01:45.840> a

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
something more specifically like this a

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.770 
something more specifically like this a
bit<00:01:46.579> then<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:47.610> should<00:01:47.939> recommend<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.479> otherwise

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
bit then I should recommend it otherwise

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.990 
bit then I should recommend it otherwise
this<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.380> not<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:50.159> first<00:01:50.579> thing<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:50.850> would

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
this is not the first thing I would

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.539 
this is not the first thing I would
recommend<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.630> beginner<00:01:51.960> nor<00:01:52.950> someone<00:01:53.399> who

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
recommend to beginner nor someone who

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.550 
recommend to beginner nor someone who
just<00:01:53.640> likes<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.090> try<00:01:54.329> something<00:01:54.659> out<00:01:54.780> this<00:01:55.380> is

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
just likes to try something out this is

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.440 
just likes to try something out this is
for<00:01:55.710> someone<00:01:55.890> who<00:01:56.040> really<00:01:56.340> knows<00:01:57.149> what

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
for someone who really knows what

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.940 
for someone who really knows what
they're<00:01:57.570> looking<00:01:57.600> for<00:01:57.930> someone<00:01:58.710> dedicated

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
they're looking for someone dedicated

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.929 
they're looking for someone dedicated
and<00:01:59.640> so<00:02:00.390> as<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:00.990> said<00:02:01.200> it's<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.829> bit<00:02:01.979> tougher<00:02:02.549> it's

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
and so as I said it's a bit tougher it's

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:09.449 
and so as I said it's a bit tougher it's
a<00:02:03.030> bit<00:02:03.180> harder<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.140> make<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.500> react

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.059 

even<00:02:10.459> though<00:02:10.580> it's<00:02:10.729> very<00:02:10.910> responsive<00:02:11.239> to<00:02:12.069> been

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
even though it's very responsive to been

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.670 
even though it's very responsive to been
the<00:02:13.250> notes<00:02:13.459> is<00:02:13.849> a<00:02:14.000> bit<00:02:14.300> harder<00:02:15.170> than<00:02:15.200> usual

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
the notes is a bit harder than usual

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.520 
the notes is a bit harder than usual
Hobbs<00:02:16.099> I<00:02:16.310> think<00:02:16.580> at<00:02:16.700> least<00:02:16.849> you<00:02:17.599> get<00:02:17.780> this<00:02:17.930> Bend

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.410 

but<00:02:21.530> you<00:02:21.920> really<00:02:22.099> have<00:02:22.250> sustained<00:02:23.120> it<00:02:23.269> with

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
but you really have sustained it with

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.949 
but you really have sustained it with
the<00:02:23.510> whole<00:02:23.750> of<00:02:24.080> your<00:02:24.349> body<00:02:24.560> to<00:02:24.830> get<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.010> real

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
the whole of your body to get the real

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.009 
the whole of your body to get the real
sustainable<00:02:26.959> bendings<00:02:27.440> and<00:02:27.739> then<00:02:28.900> so<00:02:29.900> it's

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
sustainable bendings and then so it's

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:31.570 
sustainable bendings and then so it's
not<00:02:30.140> a<00:02:30.200> bad<00:02:30.500> heart<00:02:30.860> I<00:02:30.920> definitely<00:02:31.129> not<00:02:31.549> I

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
not a bad heart I definitely not I

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.890 
not a bad heart I definitely not I
wouldn't<00:02:31.940> say<00:02:32.060> that<00:02:32.239> it's<00:02:32.480> about<00:02:33.280> 35<00:02:34.840> pounds<00:02:35.840> I

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
wouldn't say that it's about 35 pounds I

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.220 
wouldn't say that it's about 35 pounds I
guess<00:02:36.049> in<00:02:36.410> Swedish<00:02:36.799> crowns<00:02:37.069> it<00:02:37.280> was<00:02:38.200> no<00:02:39.200> I

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
guess in Swedish crowns it was no I

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.960 
guess in Swedish crowns it was no I
guess<00:02:39.440> it's<00:02:39.620> more<00:02:39.769> I<00:02:40.040> think<00:02:40.400> it<00:02:40.489> was<00:02:40.579> about<00:02:41.829> 400

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
guess it's more I think it was about 400

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.819 
guess it's more I think it was about 400
430<00:02:44.019> Swedish<00:02:45.019> crowns<00:02:45.260> so<00:02:45.379> I<00:02:45.440> guess<00:02:45.590> it's<00:02:45.769> like

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829 
430 Swedish crowns so I guess it's like

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:49.449 
430 Swedish crowns so I guess it's like
40<00:02:46.430> pounds<00:02:46.610> or<00:02:46.819> something<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.980> it<00:02:49.129> comes<00:02:49.280> in

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
40 pounds or something and it comes in

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:50.860 
40 pounds or something and it comes in
this<00:02:49.549> great<00:02:49.730> box<00:02:50.150> though<00:02:50.450> that's<00:02:50.810> the

playing harmonica this isn't my

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:21.910 
playing harmonica this isn't my
harmonica<00:03:20.540> because<00:03:21.079> it's<00:03:21.230> a<00:03:21.290> bit<00:03:21.500> tough<00:03:21.889> to

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
harmonica because it's a bit tough to

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.559 
harmonica because it's a bit tough to
play<00:03:22.220> and<00:03:22.430> I<00:03:22.489> like<00:03:22.639> my<00:03:22.819> amount<00:03:23.090> because<00:03:23.239> to<00:03:23.419> be

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
play and I like my amount because to be

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.870 
play and I like my amount because to be
very<00:03:24.319> gentle<00:03:24.769> so<00:03:24.919> that<00:03:25.069> everything<00:03:25.609> that<00:03:25.730> I<00:03:25.790> do

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
very gentle so that everything that I do

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.830 
very gentle so that everything that I do
will<00:03:26.720> come<00:03:26.930> out<00:03:27.220> like

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.699 

consequently<00:03:32.840> because<00:03:33.169> the<00:03:33.260> thing<00:03:33.440> that<00:03:33.470> is

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
consequently because the thing that is

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.370 
consequently because the thing that is
hard<00:03:33.950> in<00:03:34.639> this<00:03:34.910> bottom<00:03:35.419> and<00:03:35.569> the<00:03:35.840> high-pitched

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
hard in this bottom and the high-pitched

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.500 
hard in this bottom and the high-pitched
thing<00:03:36.680> the<00:03:37.160> high<00:03:37.280> pitch<00:03:37.519> holds<00:03:38.120> on<00:03:38.209> this<00:03:38.329> one

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
thing the high pitch holds on this one

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.690 
thing the high pitch holds on this one
to<00:03:39.049> get<00:03:39.200> the<00:03:39.470> right

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
to get the right

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.140 
to get the right
like<00:03:41.769> forget<00:03:42.769> the<00:03:42.950> right<00:03:43.099> sound<00:03:43.459> at<00:03:43.790> least<00:03:44.030> I

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
like forget the right sound at least I

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.479

had<00:03:44.419> problems<00:03:44.810> with<00:03:44.840> it<00:03:44.989> it's<00:03:45.829> like<00:03:46.069> when<00:03:46.340> I

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
had problems with it it's like when I

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:54.890 
had problems with it it's like when I
tried<00:03:46.549> to<00:03:46.700> shock<00:03:46.970> I<00:03:50.799> don't<00:03:51.799> get<00:03:51.980> the<00:03:52.099> right

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.140 

it's<00:03:55.890> a<00:03:55.950> bit<00:03:56.099> too<00:03:56.220> hard<00:03:56.459> for<00:03:56.640> me<00:03:56.760> to<00:03:56.849> blow<00:03:57.000> in

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.240 
it's a bit too hard for me to blow in
and<00:03:57.239> out<00:03:57.360> that's<00:03:58.019> of<00:03:58.470> course<00:03:58.860> if<00:03:59.040> you've<00:03:59.160> got

texture<00:04:06.510> off<00:04:06.660> the<00:04:06.810> harmonica<00:04:07.379> by<00:04:07.500> itself

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
texture off the harmonica by itself

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.979 
texture off the harmonica by itself
because<00:04:08.010> it's<00:04:08.370> got<00:04:08.519> this<00:04:08.670> like<00:04:08.879> it<00:04:09.720> got<00:04:09.870> this

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
because it's got this like it got this

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.390 
because it's got this like it got this
nice<00:04:10.200> like<00:04:10.560> winters<00:04:10.950> look<00:04:11.190> though<00:04:12.000> it's<00:04:12.989> like

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
nice like winters look though it's like

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.180 
nice like winters look though it's like
polished<00:04:14.400> in<00:04:14.549> some<00:04:14.730> like<00:04:14.940> again<00:04:15.299> I<00:04:16.190> really

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
polished in some like again I really

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.830 
polished in some like again I really
don't<00:04:17.370> know<00:04:17.519> it's<00:04:17.729> like<00:04:17.880> because<00:04:18.810> it's

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
don't know it's like because it's

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.539 
don't know it's like because it's
weighed<00:04:19.109> polish<00:04:19.530> everywhere<00:04:20.100> and<00:04:20.310> I<00:04:20.489> think

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
weighed polish everywhere and I think

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.210 
weighed polish everywhere and I think
it's<00:04:20.820> like<00:04:21.000> it<00:04:21.209> feels<00:04:21.560> weird<00:04:22.560> against<00:04:22.860> my<00:04:22.979> lips

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
it's like it feels weird against my lips

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.440 
it's like it feels weird against my lips
I<00:04:23.400> like<00:04:23.580> to<00:04:23.729> have<00:04:24.240> the<00:04:24.830> like<00:04:25.830> metal<00:04:26.550> straight

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
I like to have the like metal straight

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.440 
I like to have the like metal straight
against<00:04:27.720> my<00:04:27.840> lips<00:04:28.050> but<00:04:28.229> this<00:04:28.410> has<00:04:28.700> this<00:04:29.700> polish

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
against my lips but this has this polish

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.920 
against my lips but this has this polish
and<00:04:30.889> it's<00:04:31.889> not<00:04:32.070> my<00:04:32.220> stylist<00:04:32.820> and<00:04:33.030> I'm<00:04:33.690> not

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
and it's not my stylist and I'm not

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.830 
and it's not my stylist and I'm not
really<00:04:34.410> keen<00:04:35.010> about<00:04:35.310> the<00:04:35.870> like<00:04:38.030> then<00:04:39.030> because

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
really keen about the like then because

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.070 
really keen about the like then because
I<00:04:39.870> think<00:04:40.340> if<00:04:41.340> you<00:04:41.460> look<00:04:41.610> at<00:04:41.729> these<00:04:41.850> two<00:04:42.080> this

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
I think if you look at these two this

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.219 
I think if you look at these two this
one<00:04:43.320> is<00:04:43.410> a<00:04:43.440> bit<00:04:43.680> bulkier<00:04:44.220> it<00:04:44.460> goes<00:04:44.700> a<00:04:44.729> bit<00:04:44.850> more

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
one is a bit bulkier it goes a bit more

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:47.990 
one is a bit bulkier it goes a bit more
it's<00:04:46.229> a<00:04:46.320> bit<00:04:46.500> more<00:04:47.250> to<00:04:47.460> have<00:04:47.610> in<00:04:47.729> your<00:04:47.820> mouth

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
it's a bit more to have in your mouth

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.390 
it's a bit more to have in your mouth
when<00:04:48.360> you're<00:04:48.479> trying<00:04:48.660> to<00:04:48.780> do<00:04:48.990> this<00:04:49.080> deep<00:04:49.350> blows

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.850 

and<00:04:53.690> on<00:04:54.690> the<00:04:54.990> corner<00:04:55.860> and<00:04:56.010> other<00:04:56.479> mms<00:04:57.479> types

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
and on the corner and other mms types

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.879 
and on the corner and other mms types
has<00:04:58.860> a<00:04:59.190> quite<00:04:59.669> similar<00:05:00.000> shape<00:05:00.560> they<00:05:01.560> are<00:05:01.680> a<00:05:01.740> bit

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
has a quite similar shape they are a bit

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:05.270 
has a quite similar shape they are a bit
narrower<00:05:02.490> a<00:05:02.610> bit<00:05:03.320> smaller<00:05:04.320> so<00:05:04.620> it's<00:05:04.979> much

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
narrower a bit smaller so it's much

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.420 
narrower a bit smaller so it's much
easier<00:05:05.460> thing<00:05:05.880> to<00:05:05.910> use<00:05:06.360> these<00:05:06.960> ones<00:05:07.200> than<00:05:07.380> this

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
easier thing to use these ones than this

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.400 
easier thing to use these ones than this
so<00:05:08.430> I'm<00:05:08.580> not<00:05:08.610> really<00:05:08.880> keen<00:05:09.180> about<00:05:09.389> this<00:05:09.570> even

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
so I'm not really keen about this even

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.800 
so I'm not really keen about this even
though<00:05:10.590> I<00:05:10.770> think<00:05:11.039> it's<00:05:11.760> definitely<00:05:12.479> you<00:05:12.630> get

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
though I think it's definitely you get

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:13.730 
though I think it's definitely you get
what<00:05:13.080> you<00:05:13.260> pay<00:05:13.440> for

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
what you pay for

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.420 
what you pay for
you<00:05:14.520> do<00:05:14.669> the<00:05:15.660> reed<00:05:15.840> plates<00:05:16.169> now<00:05:16.860> the<00:05:16.919> cover

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
you do the reed plates now the cover

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.870 
you do the reed plates now the cover
plates<00:05:17.729> and<00:05:17.910> they<00:05:18.060> have<00:05:18.180> no<00:05:19.280> support<00:05:20.280> so<00:05:20.760> it's

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
plates and they have no support so it's

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.210 
plates and they have no support so it's
it<00:05:21.510> falls<00:05:21.810> over<00:05:21.990> like<00:05:22.050> this<00:05:22.349> quite<00:05:22.650> easily<00:05:22.680> and

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
it falls over like this quite easily and

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.550 
it falls over like this quite easily and
that's<00:05:23.789> sad<00:05:24.060> even<00:05:24.780> though<00:05:24.960> you<00:05:25.050> can<00:05:25.229> fix<00:05:25.410> it

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
that's sad even though you can fix it

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.820 
that's sad even though you can fix it
quite<00:05:25.740> easily<00:05:25.950> definitely<00:05:26.760> but<00:05:26.970> I<00:05:27.150> don't<00:05:27.770> yeah

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
quite easily definitely but I don't yeah

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.190 
quite easily definitely but I don't yeah
I'm<00:05:29.039> truly<00:05:29.280> keen<00:05:29.580> about<00:05:29.820> this<00:05:29.970> one<00:05:30.150> but<00:05:31.080> it<00:05:31.169> has

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.200 
I'm truly keen about this one but it has

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.980 
I'm truly keen about this one but it has
great<00:05:32.160> appearance<00:05:32.520> it<00:05:33.090> has<00:05:33.360> a<00:05:33.389> good<00:05:33.720> tone

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
great appearance it has a good tone

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.260 
great appearance it has a good tone
definitely<00:05:34.650> I<00:05:34.830> think<00:05:35.190> sometimes<00:05:35.849> it's<00:05:36.000> a<00:05:36.120> bit

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
definitely I think sometimes it's a bit

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:41.930 
definitely I think sometimes it's a bit
unreliable

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.640 

but<00:05:42.940> that<00:05:43.060> might<00:05:43.240> be<00:05:43.270> yes<00:05:43.630> because<00:05:43.780> I'm<00:05:44.170> not

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
but that might be yes because I'm not

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.250 
but that might be yes because I'm not
that<00:05:44.830> much<00:05:45.100> of<00:05:45.160> a<00:05:45.370> I'm<00:05:45.970> used<00:05:46.330> to<00:05:46.540> harmonicas

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
that much of a I'm used to harmonicas

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.930 
that much of a I'm used to harmonicas
that<00:05:47.410> easier<00:05:47.740> they're<00:05:48.220> easier<00:05:48.640> to<00:05:48.700> make

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
that easier they're easier to make

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.400 
that easier they're easier to make
thumbs<00:05:49.180> in<00:05:49.360> so<00:05:51.690> if<00:05:52.690> you<00:05:52.750> know<00:05:52.990> what<00:05:53.110> you<00:05:53.230> want

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.410 
thumbs in so if you know what you want

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:54.960 
thumbs in so if you know what you want
if<00:05:53.560> you<00:05:53.650> want<00:05:53.800> a<00:05:53.860> powerful<00:05:54.400> harmonica<00:05:54.850> that

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:54.970 
if you want a powerful harmonica that

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.480 
if you want a powerful harmonica that
you<00:05:55.150> really<00:05:55.450> need<00:05:55.660> to<00:05:55.780> force<00:05:56.350> it<00:05:56.740> doesn't<00:05:57.400> need

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
you really need to force it doesn't need

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.750 
you really need to force it doesn't need
force<00:05:57.820> to<00:05:58.000> like<00:05:58.830> if<00:05:59.830> you<00:05:59.890> like<00:06:00.130> to<00:06:00.250> blow<00:06:00.400> a<00:06:00.430> loft

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:00.760 
force to like if you like to blow a loft

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.040 
force to like if you like to blow a loft
in<00:06:00.940> your<00:06:01.060> harmonica<00:06:01.450> and<00:06:01.570> you'd<00:06:01.690> like<00:06:01.810> to<00:06:01.930> blow

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050 
in your harmonica and you'd like to blow

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:03.780 
in your harmonica and you'd like to blow
it<00:06:02.110> hard<00:06:02.410> and<00:06:02.650> you<00:06:02.740> like<00:06:02.920> this<00:06:03.130> like<00:06:03.310> old-time

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:03.790 
it hard and you like this like old-time

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.090 
it hard and you like this like old-time
blues<00:06:04.360> to<00:06:04.540> style<00:06:04.780> then<00:06:05.380> I<00:06:05.410> would<00:06:05.650> recommend

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:06.100 
blues to style then I would recommend

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.510 
blues to style then I would recommend
this<00:06:06.220> I<00:06:06.370> would<00:06:06.660> though<00:06:07.660> I<00:06:08.100> would<00:06:09.100> definitely

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:09.520 
this I would though I would definitely

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.070 
this I would though I would definitely
recommend<00:06:09.610> other<00:06:10.030> Monica's<00:06:10.600> above<00:06:10.900> it

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
recommend other Monica's above it

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.270 
recommend other Monica's above it
because<00:06:11.440> it's<00:06:11.650> not<00:06:11.800> really<00:06:12.220> my<00:06:12.660> type<00:06:14.100> like<00:06:15.100> it

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 
because it's not really my type like it

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:20.010 
because it's not really my type like it
nice<00:06:16.260> most<00:06:18.000> other<00:06:19.000> harmonicas<00:06:19.510> this<00:06:19.660> falls

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:20.020 
nice most other harmonicas this falls

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.530 
nice most other harmonicas this falls
off<00:06:20.230> but<00:06:20.500> this<00:06:20.680> is<00:06:20.920> really<00:06:21.280> is<00:06:21.490> this<00:06:22.150> still

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:22.540 
off but this is really is this still

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.420 
off but this is really is this still
sticks<00:06:22.840> and<00:06:23.080> though<00:06:23.590> I<00:06:23.620> have<00:06:23.890> it's<00:06:24.040> an<00:06:24.130> e<00:06:24.250> so

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.430 
sticks and though I have it's an e so

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.770 
sticks and though I have it's an e so
I'm<00:06:24.550> not<00:06:24.640> quite<00:06:24.790> sure<00:06:24.880> but<00:06:25.060> I<00:06:25.240> don't<00:06:25.330> think

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:25.780 
I'm not quite sure but I don't think

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.170 
I'm not quite sure but I don't think
that<00:06:26.260> it's<00:06:26.430> definitely<00:06:27.430> not<00:06:27.790> if<00:06:28.030> you're

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:28.180 
that it's definitely not if you're

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.490 
that it's definitely not if you're
beginner<00:06:28.630> you<00:06:28.810> shouldn't<00:06:29.080> use<00:06:29.290> this

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:29.500 
beginner you shouldn't use this

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.460 
beginner you shouldn't use this
definitely<00:06:30.430> not<00:06:30.630> if<00:06:31.630> you're<00:06:31.870> an<00:06:31.990> experienced

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:32.470 
definitely not if you're an experienced

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.159 
definitely not if you're an experienced
pro<00:06:32.760> you<00:06:33.760> might<00:06:33.970> I'm<00:06:34.330> not<00:06:34.540> that<00:06:34.690> experienced

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:35.169 
pro you might I'm not that experienced

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:37.770 
pro you might I'm not that experienced
so<00:06:35.700> many<00:06:36.700> people<00:06:37.090> would<00:06:37.150> definitely<00:06:37.300> like<00:06:37.750> it

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:37.780 
so many people would definitely like it

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.510 
so many people would definitely like it
and<00:06:38.140> would<00:06:38.620> definitely<00:06:38.710> like<00:06:39.100> the<00:06:39.280> thickness

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520 
and would definitely like the thickness

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.890 
and would definitely like the thickness
of<00:06:39.730> the<00:06:39.850> tone<00:06:40.060> because<00:06:40.210> this<00:06:40.450> has<00:06:40.600> a<00:06:40.630> thickness

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:40.900 
of the tone because this has a thickness

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.720 
of the tone because this has a thickness
definitely<00:06:41.500> though<00:06:41.830> this<00:06:41.980> is<00:06:42.130> an<00:06:42.280> e<00:06:42.430> I<00:06:42.460> can

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:42.730 
definitely though this is an e I can

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:50.490 
definitely though this is an e I can
still<00:06:42.940> do<00:06:43.120> this<00:06:43.270> like<00:06:47.340> and<00:06:48.810> get<00:06:49.810> this<00:06:49.990> feeling

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:50.500 
still do this like and get this feeling

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:55.380 
still do this like and get this feeling
of<00:06:50.590> broadness<00:06:51.550> and<00:06:53.280> yeah<00:06:54.280> and<00:06:54.520> that's<00:06:54.760> quite

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:55.390 
of broadness and yeah and that's quite

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:56.790 
of broadness and yeah and that's quite
everything<00:06:55.690> it's<00:06:55.930> not<00:06:56.020> that<00:06:56.169> brassy<00:06:56.410> so<00:06:56.770> I

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800 
everything it's not that brassy so I

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.850 
everything it's not that brassy so I
think<00:06:57.010> that's<00:06:57.280> this<00:06:58.180> a<00:06:58.210> con<00:06:59.110> for<00:06:59.140> me<00:06:59.380> at<00:06:59.650> least

00:06:59.850 --> 00:06:59.860 
think that's this a con for me at least

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.620 
think that's this a con for me at least
but<00:07:00.040> many<00:07:00.400> people<00:07:00.729> don't<00:07:01.060> like<00:07:01.270> the<00:07:01.419> breath

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:01.630 
but many people don't like the breath

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:05.070 
but many people don't like the breath
sound<00:07:01.990> so<00:07:03.000> though<00:07:04.000> it<00:07:04.120> has<00:07:04.210> breath<00:07:04.419> reeds<00:07:04.660> of

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:05.080 
sound so though it has breath reeds of

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.010 
sound so though it has breath reeds of
course<00:07:06.040> not<00:07:06.760> of<00:07:06.880> course<00:07:06.910> say<00:07:07.540> it'll<00:07:07.720> have<00:07:07.840> some

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:08.020 
course not of course say it'll have some

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.080 
course not of course say it'll have some
other<00:07:08.200> ones<00:07:08.380> and<00:07:09.010> it's<00:07:09.220> easy<00:07:09.370> to<00:07:09.640> disassemble

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:10.090 
other ones and it's easy to disassemble

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:13.110 
other ones and it's easy to disassemble
and<00:07:10.540> such<00:07:10.780> so<00:07:11.140> it's<00:07:11.169> not<00:07:11.410> that<00:07:11.650> much<00:07:12.490> of<00:07:12.550> a<00:07:12.760> deal

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:13.120 
and such so it's not that much of a deal

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.540 
and such so it's not that much of a deal
except<00:07:13.630> that<00:07:14.050> it's<00:07:14.169> a<00:07:14.410> bit<00:07:14.590> hard<00:07:14.860> to<00:07:14.950> blow<00:07:15.220> and

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:15.550 
except that it's a bit hard to blow and

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.930 
except that it's a bit hard to blow and
it's<00:07:15.910> not<00:07:16.510> my<00:07:16.690> style<00:07:16.990> and<00:07:17.770> a<00:07:18.220> good<00:07:18.400> wooden<00:07:18.729> comb

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:18.940 
it's not my style and a good wooden comb

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:22.580 
it's not my style and a good wooden comb
it<00:07:19.150> hasn't<00:07:19.620> done<00:07:20.620> anything<00:07:20.919> strange<00:07:21.370> to<00:07:21.580> me

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:22.590 
it hasn't done anything strange to me

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:25.500 
it hasn't done anything strange to me
the<00:07:23.590> comb<00:07:23.830> is<00:07:24.010> still<00:07:24.190> intact<00:07:24.490> and<00:07:24.880> it<00:07:25.270> hasn't

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:25.510 
the comb is still intact and it hasn't

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:28.050 
the comb is still intact and it hasn't
changed<00:07:25.720> was<00:07:26.200> shifted<00:07:26.500> that<00:07:26.620> much<00:07:26.830> so<00:07:27.640> I<00:07:27.669> would

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:28.060 
changed was shifted that much so I would

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.780 
changed was shifted that much so I would
recommend<00:07:28.600> it<00:07:28.780> if<00:07:29.140> you<00:07:29.710> really<00:07:30.310> know<00:07:30.490> what<00:07:30.669> you

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:30.790 
recommend it if you really know what you

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:34.590 
recommend it if you really know what you
want<00:07:30.970> to<00:07:31.180> I<00:07:32.080> hope<00:07:32.470> this<00:07:32.650> helps<00:07:33.040> because<00:07:33.600> before

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:34.600 
want to I hope this helps because before

want to I hope this helps because before
I<00:07:34.660> bite<00:07:34.870> it<00:07:35.050> should<00:07:35.260> really<00:07:35.680> consider<00:07:35.800> it

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:36.130 
I bite it should really consider it

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:38.040 
I bite it should really consider it
though<00:07:36.520> I<00:07:36.550> wouldn't<00:07:36.910> say<00:07:37.120> it<00:07:37.240> was<00:07:37.330> a<00:07:37.390> bad<00:07:37.540> hop<00:07:37.750> I

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:38.050 
though I wouldn't say it was a bad hop I

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:39.630 
though I wouldn't say it was a bad hop I
will<00:07:38.380> just<00:07:38.500> say<00:07:38.620> that<00:07:38.650> I<00:07:38.860> don't<00:07:38.919> like<00:07:39.220> it<00:07:39.400> and

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:39.640 
will just say that I don't like it and

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:43.130 
will just say that I don't like it and
