00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:10.610
 Hi everyone, this time is again a mutant creature 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:13.160
 Monde introduction It is late for this to put out, but it is still 1.4 stores 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:17.840
 Dechotto Mine craft does not correspond 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:20.370
 I'm downgrading and now I'm playing with 1.4 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:25.200
 Source of mutant creature was put 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:27.930
 Because it is divided and introduced to this already- mutant creature part 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:35.270
 Mutant Zombie Mutant Cree par on the next 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:35.270
 And this time I would like to introduce Mutant Snow Golem Yes 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:43.960
 Positive how to make Bhutan and snow golem in 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:49.780
 Since the potion is such you need to say x from you 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:52.960
 It is the completion of you or Rex put a bottle of Oite water to such Fu obsidian 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:59.600
 And you can make this a mutant 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:00.930
 Throwing monsters or animals will result in a 50% chance of being mutant. 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.300
 Then 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.330
 I think that want to go 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.270
 Ray 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.430
 Someone got up 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.850
 came 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.850
 And 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.120
 Had disappeared 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.330
 As I said my little while ago because the probability of 50% 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.540
 Let's take a look 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.540
 love 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:33.560
 I heard this is Mutant Snow Golem 

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:35.360
 It is not this play that this day is different from the monster a little while ago 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.330
 Even out such of at 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:42.860
 I will not attack you 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:45.470
 Let's go looking for the best of the Well 1 mutant zombies 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:50.450
 But I do not have to search 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:55.180
 I was creative and I got a mutant egg when I went here 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.180
 Because the mutant zombie is this 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.299
 I'm happy 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.299
 Written I 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:08.280
 Yes 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:13.020
 What kind of enemy of the 4th rib of the channel that the channel has come? 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:18.740
 Throwing gifts to such Fu even nothing at Kripa in Toka zombie 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.740
 at this is a little bit of a fight 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:26.299
 There is a scrub like a hungry movie just by looking at this 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:29.450
 But because it is possible to meet hole in such Fu 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:31.260
 This is bad luck for us to win 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.010
 are 4 y 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.090
 Use the pond ice 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:40.470
 Mutant snow golem 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:43.230
 Yes and is so Golem of mutant room receive a 1 damage will also Naoso it 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.580
 Is to throw the ball in such Fu 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.580
 Then I will recover 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:55.710
 When you right-click to say yes and this 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:59.350
 My name is me and I wake up to the Mart 6 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:02.680
 Because it is Tom 0 017 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.500
 Pooh in the feeling Tom 00117 pet 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.100
 Come out above 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.980
 Good luck 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.900
 Now golem yeah 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.049
 Good 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.480
 If you look at the vampire Tanto zombie I think that you understand 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:20.720
 I know I have to burn 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:24.910
 Yes Mutant Zombie Hen and Mutant 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:28.060
 The creeper side has a link where you see more 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:31.960
 It's now because I made a playlist 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.850
 You can go to the playlist by clicking the burn and the motion that came out Mutants 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.330
 All of the creatures 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:40.000
 This guy 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:42.750
 The coolest thing is that the best thing is that it's not true 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.430
 When I walk on the water like this 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.430
 It lumps in the blink of an eye Akumaiza 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:54.250
 Yes It hardens in a moment 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.250
 And when it falls in the water, this person 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.290
 I 'm jumping , I 'm not good at water 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.310
 Economy 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:11.340
 Well, in most cases it will fall into the water but if it falls it will jump out 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.340
 Yes Well 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:17.690
 This person who is strong 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.590
 Longer more and more rapidly recovery Once that this kind of Fu in One of bowl full have 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.430
 Because it will 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:25.590
 It is okay if there are a lot of zombies with mu standing 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.750
 It did not disappear even if peaceful 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:31.750
 And 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.750
 It's a bit sad, but throw away all one goal 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.740
 Come on a minute 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:45.719
 This is a video, so I can not help 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.920
 I'm sorry 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:58.540
 Well, I 'm going to do something with a prefectural car 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:05:01.129
 Also that this mutant as defeated 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:03.789
 In what Golem of 5 dropped 

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:03.789
 newly 

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:10.399
 You can make a snow golem 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.350
 I have been 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.670

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:21.570

 Yes, and in such the 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:38.170
 I think that the mutant enderman went before 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:38.170
 I think I will fix in the next update because Enderman has a bug now 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:50.150
 This is the New Tanto Enderman, but I showed it a little earlier 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:52.210
 Older age will work with the next update, so now it doesn't move at all 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.639
 Hardly do anything 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:06:00.350

00:05:54.639 --> 00:06:02.540

 Added back- floor videos of mutant creatures to the playlist
