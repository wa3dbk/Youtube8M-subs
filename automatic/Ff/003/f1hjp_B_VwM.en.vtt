00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.690 
how it works
that<00:03:40.080> doesn't<00:03:40.470> make<00:03:40.560> sense<00:03:40.620> to<00:03:40.920> me<00:03:41.010> what<00:03:41.340> they

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
that doesn't make sense to me what they

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.850 
that doesn't make sense to me what they
save<00:03:41.940> your<00:03:42.090> ankles<00:03:42.450> somehow<00:03:42.840> yeah<00:03:43.350> this<00:03:43.560> this

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
save your ankles somehow yeah this this

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.490 
save your ankles somehow yeah this this
is<00:03:44.040> pretty<00:03:44.430> much<00:03:44.580> the<00:03:44.790> reason<00:03:45.150> why<00:03:46.110> I<00:03:46.140> actually

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
is pretty much the reason why I actually

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.610 
is pretty much the reason why I actually
buy<00:03:46.830> these<00:03:46.890> and<00:03:47.420> also<00:03:48.420> because<00:03:49.019> they're

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
buy these and also because they're

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.620 
buy these and also because they're
readable<00:03:50.250> as<00:03:50.580> well<00:03:50.760> I<00:03:50.790> mean<00:03:51.060> I<00:03:51.120> didn't<00:03:51.450> really

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
readable as well I mean I didn't really

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.570 
readable as well I mean I didn't really
expect<00:03:51.989> them<00:03:52.140> to<00:03:52.170> meet<00:03:52.380> this<00:03:52.620> durable<00:03:53.100> this<00:03:53.400> is

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
expect them to meet this durable this is

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.190 
expect them to meet this durable this is
probably<00:03:53.850> the<00:03:54.000> most<00:03:54.150> of<00:03:54.390> shoes<00:03:54.570> lost<00:03:54.900> at<00:03:55.049> me

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
probably the most of shoes lost at me

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.160 
probably the most of shoes lost at me
like<00:03:56.190> recently<00:03:56.820> probably<00:03:57.360> my<00:03:57.510> these<00:03:57.930> are<00:03:57.989> my
