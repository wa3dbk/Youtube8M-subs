00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.980
 requests and I am pleased to perform them in 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.899
 comments to the video about the wardrobe in the fall 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.360
 the girl asked me to tell you about 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:34.489
 what things can be without losing 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.190
 accessories in the wardrobe I want to tell 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.650
 about these subtleties and share how i 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.350
 I pick them so that they are not relevant 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.629
 one season and as a bonus I'll show you a few 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.420
 tricks that will help without harm to 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:49.940
 health stop walking on flat sole 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.059
 long time high heels and 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.750
 so the most win-win accessories in 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.649
 wardrobe are scarves and handkerchiefs and 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.379
 stoles 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:03.079
 where to start your choice for autumn and winter 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.960
 choose scarves or tippet and large 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.300
 and long simply because with long 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.119
 scarves you have more options for them 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.830
 tying the second important point is that 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.619
 shade or coloring should 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.590
 blend in with your skin tone if u 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.070
 you brown eyes dark hair and dark 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.739
 leather 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.530
 choose a scarf and bright colors with a cold 

00:01:21.739 --> 00:01:26.989
 undertone for example crimson white blue 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.239
 turquoise and so on girls with 

00:01:26.989 --> 00:01:31.039
 brown or red hair with 

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:34.250
 light eyes and skin tone 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:36.160
 It is recommended to choose scarves saturated 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.349
 brown olive 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:42.380
 yellow burgundy shade avoid 

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:43.009
 gray black blue gray blue 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.830
 shades 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:48.500
 since the skin tom will look pale 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.950
 eyes lose expressiveness to girls 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.179
 with blond hair and bright eyes 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.959
 should pay attention to bright 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:58.959
 warm shades of gold 

00:01:55.959 --> 00:02:01.610
 light green coral beige 

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:05.720
 pistachio are not recommended 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:08.179
 blue brown black purple these 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.860
 the colors will redden the skin tone and 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.980
 emphasize its shortcomings 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.550
 if you have light eyes cold tone 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.530
 skin light brown or dark blond hair 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.150
 notice the white color is bright 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.670
 orange lime 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:26.150
 as well as the color with a cold hint 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.879
 blue blue gray green cold rose 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.180
 you putting on outerwear with patterns in 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:34.220
 cage or strip pick up 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:38.959
 plain scarf or vice versa will be too 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:41.209
 look very harmonious and of course 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.849
 choosing a scarf stole or shawl 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:46.819
 imagine with what you will wear it 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.859
 what coat cardigan jacket will be 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.349
 the most harmoniously combined 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:54.140
 in winter usually using two options 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:57.230
 I tied a scarf and mostly in the winter I 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:01.569
 found a tippet and a silk spring 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.569
 viscose tie them up by mood 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.410
 if you want a thing not one season 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.020
 pleased you and it was also relevant 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.190
 choose accessories of classic colors 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.069
 and styles 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.590
 for example high heels 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:27.830
 beige is not the first 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.620
 year 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.890
 choosing the color of the people pay attention to 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.470
 patton of your skin if it is cold we take 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.380
 Nude with cold base and vice versa 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.510
 then you will definitely hit the feet 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.310
 will look ideal and also 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.230
 feel perfect when walking in 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.959
 high heels shoes 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.660
 narrowed nose when thumb 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:53.090
 is deformed and 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.880
 may develop the so -called 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.920
 bone to avoid it knowing that 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.410
 long time will have to spend on 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.300
 high heels i wear silicone 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.209
 corrector which prevents 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:07.310
 deformation of the fingers and at the same time in the area 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.650
 thumb prevents from 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.170
 rubbing this shoe model for me 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:15.739
 the find came to a point with color and 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:18.500
 podton holds the leg tightly do not rub 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:21.290
 this is probably my previous reward 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.970
 bad experience i could buy a model 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.669
 because I liked 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.360
 original design but not comfortable 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:29.300
 block 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.800
 and as a result, both of them have never been 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:36.260
 learn from our mistakes and experiences 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.810
 another classic shoe in the wardrobe is 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.990
 ballet shoes from various materials and 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:45.410
 actual seasonal colors dynamically 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.390
 practical but unfortunately it is flat 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.370
 sole and foot time to be 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:52.460
 long time in such shoes 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.740
 and for those who have flat feet especially to 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.570
 unfortunately in ballet shoes do not make the insole with 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.240
 arch support but we ourselves about it 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.250
 can take care and ease walking and 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.169
 extend the health of our pillar in 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:06.440
 orthopedic store or pharmacy 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:08.990
 buy insole silicone arch support 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.840
 heel thanks to her amortized and 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:14.479
 foot supports instep and silicone 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.630
 hygienic so washed and again you can 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:16.630
 use 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:35.880
 Here are some simple tricks and you can wear 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:38.040
 any shoes and with pleasure in this 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.710
 the model fell in love at first sight 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:43.530
 seeing that she was the only one 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:46.350
 my size so i'm already starting 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:50.010

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:53.490
 will emphasize your image and your style then where 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:56.070
 people look into this wallet with interest 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:59.030
 money house should be spacious 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:02.610
 so that paper notes are not wrinkled 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:05.340
 I have comfortable elongated spacious models 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:09.420
 roomy where can i put everything 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:11.790
 in places and in order it is convenient for me when 

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:14.310
 there are several departments for different 

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:17.720
 money value and a compartment for coins and 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.720
 card space 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:26.460
 calm shade with contrast embroidered 

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:28.860
 pattern creates a concise discreet 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:31.520
 Elegant look and suitable for a variety of 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:34.469
