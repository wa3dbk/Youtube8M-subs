00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.750
 hello to all the video of today in 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.550
 their stories recognized the crown 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.880
 natural and the interiors that we are going to 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:19.970
 need are these that are being 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:23.119
 wire this is two meters of the number 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.820
 24 there are different thicknesses between more 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.650
 cheap wants to be that it's thinner than 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.090
 wire and they will need more meters 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.939
 so that your crown is there is enough 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.990
 fixed between thicker the wire goes 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.110
 to be more expensive but they will need 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:38.480
 less meters then there depends on what 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.370
 that they are going to use and many 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.560
 Flowers of the colors that you choose 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.350
 and of these sizes that also 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.900
 like and ways so there are many are of 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.810
 paper 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:53.890
 The only thing that flowers require is 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:56.590
 that they are in the branch because 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.440
 they need the stem because with this thing 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.180
 they are going to screw it then a flower that 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.090
 come this way flat on the back is not going to 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:08.190
 serve unless you want what they are going 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:11.760
 to do is that they are going to measure the head 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:15.420
 for that I'm going to make a ready model 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:18.930
 I came back with my models and they are 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.720
 explaining from the head they are going to take the 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.650
 wire 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:29.890
 and they're going to put it in this part of their 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:32.110
 head where are the eyebrows more or less 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.850
 they were going to measure the circumference if they have 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.670
 a tape measure talking to a tape 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.159
 metric or if you can not do it with your 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.930
 sister or someone who has a head 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.960
 about the size more or less similar to that of 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:48.380
 your 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:50.600
 Look, they're going to take the circle and I'm good 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.270
 they are going to roll it that size with the 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:57.259
 rest of the wire so they're going to do 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.299
 is to make sure that the measure you have 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.009
 your wire or be like the circle that 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:02.720
 remains is the size of your head 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:07.300
 then they will be placed 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:10.000
 they obviously put it on 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.670
 and once they realize that they do not 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 they are not too tight too loose go 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:19.090
 to close it to secure its crown and 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.830
 this is one they are going to give it a few laps 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.830
 with the edges that they have left 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.410
 make sure it is firm 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.080
 the crown that is not going to walk 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:39.490
 moving anyway what is going to 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:43.530
 give resistance is the stems of the 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.530
 flowers because they are going to go 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.959
 that is closed they measure it again 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.549
 they make sure they look good and 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.879
 then we can start placing 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.879
 flowers 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:02.080
 here I have a flower ready if you want 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:05.140
 give not so many laps to the flowers what 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:08.740
 what they can do is cut the stem 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:12.120
 but at this moment what I 'm going to do 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.120
 nothing else is entangling 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:21.410
 and with that they will give more tension to 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:23.510
 your crown and so they will prevent you from 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.790
 moving anyway a move moves 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.790
 little but make sure that the flowers 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.820
 always stay out because here 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.230
 in here here is worth his head and for 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.170
 here is what remains as a consultant 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.760
 then the flowers should look like this 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.920
 and good is a matter of intercalating 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.530
 the tastes of each doing is to follow 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.460
 embroidering x giving by giving or binding or 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.330
 as you want to call 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:49.630
 all the other flowers around your 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.630
 crown 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.420
 and repeat 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.549
 should be staying more or less like that 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:05.030
 back and this is what helps your 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:06.739
 crown is no longer as fragile as it is 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.900
 the force that is applying it now 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:12.109
 that are growing stems are going 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.970
 traveling, they also deform 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:17.000
 hoop is changing shape then 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:20.410
 I feel they have to structure again 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.410
 I would be measuring it constantly 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:28.430
 Dealing with mistakes from time to time 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:32.080
 it is also good that 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.080
 jal in a popular 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.940
 the flowers accentuate so that they remain 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.710
 I want you to go around that you do not walk around 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.710
 moving 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.710
 another thing install colors 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:56.999
 in this direction and the next flower you 

00:04:53.159 --> 00:05:01.319
 they will put this going down and another tip 

00:04:56.999 --> 00:05:03.889
 It is also that when they tie one of the 

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:03.889
 stems 

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:08.720
 one 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:12.409
 go 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:16.069
 one stem 5 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:19.119
 for example so be it and that the 

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:19.119
 next flower they eat 

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:21.969
 go 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:32.710
 go up and with that they are going to 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:36.420
 achieve is to go as if weaving a 1 to 1 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.420
 other flowers and with that they will have 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:42.850
 I recommend you do it for 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:45.880
 sections I do not know what I'm going to put about 20 

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:48.100
 flowers 30 and then if they take the ones from 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:51.370
 case he has the bands because if he is 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:54.610
 very heavy because of the crowning 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.960
 approximately one half hour 40 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.060
 minutes 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.660
 I say in doing the whole process of 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:05.310
 place the flowers I do not tell them anymore 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:14.480
 cut fears in such long 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:17.379
 here because I work on the wire 

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:20.539
 work apart 

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:24.379
 well I'm the product and I'm 

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:27.340
 finished and anyway whenever 

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:31.550
 one of these is over I got tired 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:34.910
 you have to take care of the flowers 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:39.980
 so I'm not going to go then lose 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:43.360
 as the round shape measure it several 

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:47.020
 times and no longer as refine details 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:50.480
 of your combinations to store it 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:53.930
 they are putting it in a bag 

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:57.520
 of plastic or in a box of provenance 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.520
 so that no more suns are postponed 

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:02.100
 you do not need many materials either 

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:04.070
 a lot of money but if you require 

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:08.360
 a lot of time 

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:10.700
 I wait for the tutorial and see you 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:13.480
