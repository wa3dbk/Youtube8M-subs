00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
that way I knew where I wanted the

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.089 
that way I knew where I wanted the
placement<00:02:41.180> of<00:02:41.239> the<00:02:41.360> letters<00:02:41.599> to<00:02:41.780> be<00:02:41.920> so<00:02:42.920> once

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
placement of the letters to be so once

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:44.320 
placement of the letters to be so once
you<00:02:43.160> have<00:02:43.340> that<00:02:43.459> obviously<00:02:43.819> you<00:02:43.970> can<00:02:44.090> start

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
you have that obviously you can start

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.759

painting<00:02:44.540> we<00:02:44.989> found<00:02:45.200> that<00:02:45.260> the<00:02:45.380> best<00:02:45.560> way<00:02:45.739> to

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
painting we found that the best way to

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:47.590 
painting we found that the best way to
do<00:02:45.980> this<00:02:46.099> was<00:02:46.310> to<00:02:46.489> use<00:02:46.640> the<00:02:46.910> dabber<00:02:47.120> not<00:02:47.450> the

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
do this was to use the dabber not the

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.840 
do this was to use the dabber not the
brush<00:02:47.840> and<00:02:48.079> then<00:02:48.620> also<00:02:48.890> to<00:02:49.100> use<00:02:49.340> a<00:02:49.370> light

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
brush and then also to use a light

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.580 
brush and then also to use a light
amount<00:02:50.120> of<00:02:50.299> paint<00:02:50.570> and<00:02:50.720> kind<00:02:50.989> of<00:02:51.109> gradually

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
amount of paint and kind of gradually

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.259 
amount of paint and kind of gradually
layer<00:02:51.859> it<00:02:52.070> on<00:02:52.190> top<00:02:52.370> of<00:02:52.430> each<00:02:52.609> other<00:02:52.730> because<00:02:53.000> if

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
layer it on top of each other because if

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:54.729 
layer it on top of each other because if
you<00:02:53.329> use<00:02:53.510> too<00:02:53.720> much<00:02:53.750> paint<00:02:54.079> at<00:02:54.200> once<00:02:54.410> it<00:02:54.620> will

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
you use too much paint at once it will

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.170 
you use too much paint at once it will
just<00:02:54.859> cause<00:02:55.070> it<00:02:55.220> to<00:02:55.340> bleed<00:02:55.549> underneath<00:02:56.000> your

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
just cause it to bleed underneath your

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.390 
just cause it to bleed underneath your
stencil<00:02:56.570> so<00:02:57.260> I<00:02:57.320> just<00:02:57.500> continued<00:02:57.890> this<00:02:58.010> until<00:02:58.190> I

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
stencil so I just continued this until I

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.390 
stencil so I just continued this until I

her<00:03:30.590> fingers<00:03:30.950> down<00:03:31.160> as<00:03:31.400> she<00:03:31.549> continues<00:03:31.970> down

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
her fingers down as she continues down

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.759

that way once again no paint is slipping

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.229 
that way once again no paint is slipping
out<00:03:38.319> from<00:03:38.530> underneath<00:03:38.800> and<00:03:39.220> it's<00:03:39.430> gonna<00:03:39.580> make

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
out from underneath and it's gonna make

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:41.460 
out from underneath and it's gonna make
your<00:03:40.360> onesie<00:03:40.660> look<00:03:40.840> kind<00:03:41.019> of<00:03:41.050> watch<00:03:41.230> or

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
anything like that so just put your

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.490 
anything like that so just put your
fingers<00:03:43.120> really<00:03:43.360> tight<00:03:43.660> beside<00:03:43.989> the<00:03:44.110> stencil

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
fingers really tight beside the stencil

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.869 
fingers really tight beside the stencil
where<00:03:44.650> you're<00:03:44.860> actually<00:03:45.010> dabbing<00:03:45.519> it<00:03:45.610> at<00:03:45.730> the

where you're actually dabbing it at the

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:47.550 
where you're actually dabbing it at the
time<00:03:46.090> and<00:03:46.390> then<00:03:46.900> that'll<00:03:47.110> make<00:03:47.230> for<00:03:47.470> a<00:03:47.500> very

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
time and then that'll make for a very

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.330 
time and then that'll make for a very
clean<00:03:48.220> line

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
clean line

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.490
