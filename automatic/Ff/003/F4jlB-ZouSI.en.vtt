00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
fine line and it's pretty much like a

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.950 
fine line and it's pretty much like a
felt<00:00:22.769> eyeliner<00:00:23.160> kit<00:00:23.550> this<00:00:24.090> was<00:00:24.300> forty<00:00:24.660> seven

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
felt eyeliner kit this was forty seven

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.320

dollars it's waterproof liquid eyeliner
and<00:00:27.570> felt<00:00:28.170> liners<00:00:28.560> are<00:00:28.769> super<00:00:29.189> easy<00:00:29.369> because

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
and felt liners are super easy because

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.220 
and felt liners are super easy because
you<00:00:29.849> literally<00:00:30.150> just<00:00:30.539> draw<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:30.929> on<00:00:31.019> your<00:00:31.199> eye

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
you literally just draw it on your eye

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.970 
you literally just draw it on your eye
and<00:00:31.619> you<00:00:31.920> have<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.279> most<00:00:32.460> control<00:00:32.759> over<00:00:33.980> the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
and you have the most control over the

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.299 
and you have the most control over the
shape<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.700> it's<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.210> lot<00:00:36.420> easier<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:37.110> learn<00:00:37.320> to

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
shape and it's a lot easier to learn to

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.790 
shape and it's a lot easier to learn to
use<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.489> felt<00:00:38.820> liner<00:00:39.090> versus<00:00:39.780> an<00:00:39.989> actual<00:00:40.410> liquid

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
use a felt liner versus an actual liquid

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.560 
use a felt liner versus an actual liquid
eyeliner<00:00:41.190> because<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.610> was<00:00:41.790> very<00:00:41.820> hard<00:00:42.300> for<00:00:42.450> me

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
eyeliner because I was very hard for me

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.020 
eyeliner because I was very hard for me
to<00:00:42.600> learn<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.710> looks<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.160> lot<00:00:44.489> more<00:00:44.550> bold

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
to learn and it looks a lot more bold

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.279 
to learn and it looks a lot more bold
versus<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:47.090> pencil<00:00:48.090> eyeliner<00:00:48.420> so<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:48.989> comes<00:00:49.110> in

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
versus a pencil eyeliner so it comes in

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.930 
versus a pencil eyeliner so it comes in
a<00:00:49.379> really<00:00:49.530> nice<00:00:49.770> tin<00:00:50.129> like<00:00:50.370> this<00:00:50.610> which<00:00:50.820> I

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
a really nice tin like this which I

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.490 
a really nice tin like this which I
really<00:00:51.210> like<00:00:51.360> because<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.750> can<00:00:51.930> actually<00:00:52.320> use

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
really like because I can actually use

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.100 
really like because I can actually use
that<00:00:52.800> for<00:00:53.430> storage<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:54.120> other<00:00:54.390> things<00:00:54.719> when<00:00:55.079> I

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
that for storage of other things when I

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.750 
that for storage of other things when I
want<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.590> take<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.920> eyeliners<00:00:56.309> out<00:00:56.489> which<00:00:56.640> is

tried the blue eyeliner on my eyes today
and<00:01:23.759> for<00:01:24.180> some<00:01:24.420> reason<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:25.020> feels<00:01:25.380> like<00:01:25.890> it's

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
and for some reason it feels like it's

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.770 
and for some reason it feels like it's
already<00:01:26.549> dried<00:01:26.820> out<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.299> might<00:01:27.509> take<00:01:27.659> it

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
already dried out so I might take it

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.120 
already dried out so I might take it
back<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:28.080> Sephora<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.409> see<00:01:28.619> if<00:01:28.680> they<00:01:28.799> can<00:01:28.950> give

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 
have quite oily skin I'm in the winter

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.460 
have quite oily skin I'm in the winter
time<00:01:54.520> I<00:01:54.580> find<00:01:54.910> my<00:01:55.030> skin<00:01:55.330> is<00:01:55.480> a<00:01:55.510> lot<00:01:55.750> more<00:01:55.990> oily

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
time I find my skin is a lot more oily

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.860 
time I find my skin is a lot more oily
er<00:01:56.500> probably<00:01:57.460> because<00:01:57.760> my<00:01:58.000> skin<00:01:58.240> is<00:01:58.300> so<00:01:58.660> dry

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
er probably because my skin is so dry

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.530 
er probably because my skin is so dry
and<00:01:59.260> then<00:01:59.380> my<00:01:59.530> my<00:02:00.220> face<00:02:00.610> is<00:02:00.850> pretty<00:02:01.390> much

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.540 
and then my my face is pretty much

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.200 
and then my my face is pretty much
telling<00:02:01.810> me<00:02:02.020> that<00:02:02.260> I<00:02:02.560> need<00:02:03.160> to<00:02:03.520> put<00:02:04.030> more

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
telling me that I need to put more

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.060 
telling me that I need to put more
moisturizer<00:02:04.750> on<00:02:04.870> so<00:02:05.230> it's<00:02:05.410> kind<00:02:05.590> of<00:02:05.620> producing

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
moisturizer on so it's kind of producing

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.740 
moisturizer on so it's kind of producing
more<00:02:06.280> oil<00:02:06.340> which<00:02:06.850> is<00:02:06.880> what<00:02:07.330> I<00:02:07.360> think<00:02:07.450> is

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
more oil which is what I think is

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.420 
more oil which is what I think is
happening<00:02:07.930> because<00:02:08.200> my<00:02:08.470> hair<00:02:08.680> also<00:02:08.920> gets<00:02:09.310> a

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:09.430 
happening because my hair also gets a

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.670 
happening because my hair also gets a
lot<00:02:09.580> more<00:02:09.610> oily<00:02:10.119> or<00:02:10.149> in<00:02:10.600> the<00:02:11.110> winter<00:02:11.530> time

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
lot more oily or in the winter time

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.330 
lot more oily or in the winter time
which<00:02:11.890> is<00:02:12.010> kind<00:02:12.190> of<00:02:12.220> weird<00:02:13.140> but<00:02:14.160> it's<00:02:15.160> pretty

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
which is kind of weird but it's pretty

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.180 
which is kind of weird but it's pretty
much<00:02:15.520> like<00:02:15.580> a<00:02:15.760> mini<00:02:16.230> size<00:02:17.230> of<00:02:17.560> their<00:02:17.770> makeup

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
much like a mini size of their makeup

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.920 
much like a mini size of their makeup
setting<00:02:18.490> spray<00:02:18.640> I<00:02:18.850> think<00:02:19.120> it's<00:02:19.540> perfect<00:02:19.900> for

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
setting spray I think it's perfect for

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.480 
setting spray I think it's perfect for
your<00:02:20.110> purse<00:02:20.350> which<00:02:20.650> is<00:02:20.680> good<00:02:20.980> because<00:02:21.130> I<00:02:21.340> can

with being this obnoxious with my nails

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
you do have to use like a good four

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.690 
you do have to use like a good four
coats<00:04:00.870> for<00:04:01.200> it<00:04:01.290> to<00:04:01.440> become<00:04:01.770> this<00:04:02.280> sort<00:04:02.550> of

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
coats for it to become this sort of

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.700 
coats for it to become this sort of
opaque<00:04:03.060> but<00:04:03.360> it<00:04:03.540> looks<00:04:03.720> gorgeous<00:04:03.990> and<00:04:04.440> it'll

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:04.710 
opaque but it looks gorgeous and it'll

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.520 
opaque but it looks gorgeous and it'll
last<00:04:04.890> you<00:04:05.100> a<00:04:05.130> very<00:04:05.220> long<00:04:05.460> time<00:04:05.640> and<00:04:06.270> a<00:04:07.020> faster

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
last you a very long time and a faster

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.980 
last you a very long time and a faster
way<00:04:07.650> of<00:04:07.680> taking<00:04:08.160> it<00:04:08.310> off<00:04:08.520> is<00:04:08.850> by<00:04:09.060> using<00:04:09.330> acetone

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990 
way of taking it off is by using acetone

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.930 
way of taking it off is by using acetone
because<00:04:10.200> glitter<00:04:10.680> is<00:04:10.920> really<00:04:11.430> really<00:04:11.640> hard<00:04:11.820> to

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
because glitter is really really hard to

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.120 
because glitter is really really hard to
get<00:04:12.060> off<00:04:12.210> but<00:04:12.690> if<00:04:12.810> you<00:04:12.960> use<00:04:13.110> acetone<00:04:13.710> it's<00:04:13.980> a

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
get off but if you use acetone it's a

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.220 
get off but if you use acetone it's a
lot<00:04:14.310> faster<00:04:14.490> and<00:04:14.880> then<00:04:15.390> the<00:04:15.540> next<00:04:15.900> thing<00:04:16.049> I<00:04:16.200> got

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
lot faster and then the next thing I got

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:21.680 
lot faster and then the next thing I got
was<00:04:16.739> this<00:04:17.070> Sephora<00:04:17.730> brand<00:04:19.640> Pro<00:04:20.640> bent<00:04:21.060> eyeliner

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
was this Sephora brand Pro bent eyeliner

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.080 
was this Sephora brand Pro bent eyeliner
I<00:04:22.440> probably<00:04:22.860> should<00:04:23.100> have<00:04:23.130> opened<00:04:23.520> this<00:04:23.610> up<00:04:23.910> a

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
I probably should have opened this up a

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.870 
I probably should have opened this up a
little<00:04:24.360> bit<00:04:24.600> earlier<00:04:25.590> before<00:04:26.310> this<00:04:26.400> video<00:04:26.580> but

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
little bit earlier before this video but

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.580 
little bit earlier before this video but
it's<00:04:27.090> a<00:04:27.210> really<00:04:27.570> nice<00:04:27.720> eyeliner<00:04:29.900> brush<00:04:30.900> but<00:04:31.500> I

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
it's a really nice eyeliner brush but I

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.530 
it's a really nice eyeliner brush but I
can't<00:04:31.860> seem<00:04:32.130> to<00:04:32.220> get<00:04:32.430> it<00:04:32.550> open<00:04:32.820> but<00:04:33.180> anyways

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:33.540 
can't seem to get it open but anyways

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.870 
can't seem to get it open but anyways
it's<00:04:33.810> pretty<00:04:33.990> much<00:04:34.140> like<00:04:34.200> bent<00:04:34.850> hopefully<00:04:35.850> I

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
it's pretty much like bent hopefully I

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.820 
it's pretty much like bent hopefully I
can<00:04:36.000> zoom<00:04:36.360> this<00:04:36.570> thing<00:04:36.780> for<00:04:37.050> you<00:04:37.140> guys<00:04:37.290> it's

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
very nicely bent so it gives you a

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.380 
very nicely bent so it gives you a
little<00:04:40.620> bit<00:04:40.740> more<00:04:40.890> control<00:04:41.460> and<00:04:41.790> I'm<00:04:42.150> probably

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
little bit more control and I'm probably

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.280 
little bit more control and I'm probably
gonna<00:04:42.780> use<00:04:42.900> this<00:04:43.290> for<00:04:43.680> more<00:04:44.040> of<00:04:44.190> my<00:04:44.220> concealer
