00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
wondering what it actually was I had a

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.850 
wondering what it actually was I had a
lot<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.030> speculations<00:01:51.869> on<00:01:52.049> reddit<00:01:52.439> but<00:01:52.740> it

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
lot of speculations on reddit but it
