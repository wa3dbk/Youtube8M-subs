00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.429
 Hello everyone, I will be for you today 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.849
 write down an option here these 4 palettes here 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.620
 I â€™m still not getting used to Lorak 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.540
 correct emphasis put me girls 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.789
 asked for but also past videos so that I 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.800
 I did a mini review on these palettes and I 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.289
 thought why not usually i 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.210
 try not to review one not 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.000
 product but since there are 4 palettes here 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.699
 mini-collection then I think that some 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.759
 will be interesting especially if you like 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.010
 such video promo palette shadows in general 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.670
 stay with me these 4 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:41.280
 the palettes they are called sweet temptation 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:45.239
 translated means sweet temptation or 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.039
 sweet temptations and me they are very 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.370
 liked their appearance they 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.410
 look like little chocolate bars 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.360
 beautiful packaging with these palette meme 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.230
 need to do any makeup and for each 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.640
 no romantic day and such a field 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.699
 something between grammatical and 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.280
 natural makeup is very good 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.180
 The quality of the girl's shadow is good 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.439
 pigmentation 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.330
 In general, I am pretty but with these cells 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.150
 let's now go through each about them 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.950
 in short, I'll tell you and let's get started 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.740
 from the first pallet which is intended 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.460
 for a natural make-up make-up on 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.380
 every day 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.720
 she is called with this her own herbs and 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.060
 crunch i thought to translate you first 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.600
 title or not because literal 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.880
 transfer 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.970
 pretty and funny for example this 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.630
 that will be satisfying with its crunch 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.970
 toffee 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.439
 to affect such candy here in the states 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:43.049
 sold and sounds so fun but they 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:46.710
 look like chocolate bars so 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:50.850
 probably such name came up when 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.009
 I open the very palette here mirror 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.509
 all four palettes and the same palette 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.200
 on a magnet, that is, it is very easy 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.890
 closes opens too go 4 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.080
 shade 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.840
 I really liked it, I personally love 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.050
 such shades are brown and beige 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:09.030
 gold and bronze means there are 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.959
 cream tina to the first so beautiful 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.470
 very much later 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:16.170
 and the gold water is brown then 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.810
 Copper with a red shimmer and dark 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.500
 brown with a bronze sheen all 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.630
 shades very well pigmented 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.940
 beautiful such me here is copper with red 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.340
 ebb also liked in and rarely such 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:33.030
 shades use it as a dream i try 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.560
 so that the shoes are not present some 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.720
 red tint because sometimes 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:42.269
 it turns out that the eyes then look like 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:43.890
 tired but here's a dark brown with 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.500
 bronze tint and these are the first 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.739
 I really liked two hundred percent 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.920
 I will use this palette 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:55.260
 most often and by the way in this palette all 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.510
 These niches are peaceful except for 1 shade. 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.970
 Now that it is more like cream on 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.269
 satin shade next tile 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.850
 which next tile 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:07.590
 the next mark I show you 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:11.220
 looks like a bar of white chocolate 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:14.010
 such packaging see this is a palette for 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.920
 dramatic makeup and it's called 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.070
 gave them that and any chocolat that is 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.880
 indulge in white chocolate or 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.970
 give pleasure 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.260
 white chocolate myself literally on my 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.670
 loyalty to the translation is very good for me 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.880
 I try to get mine 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:33.630
 and here it means there is a light golden hue 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.940
 light silver and black 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.640
 such it is more satinous because in 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:43.920
 there are such small gold ones 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:46.950
 pieces yes beautiful such to me this 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.510
 also liked the palette and they themselves 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.400
 how much will I use it 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.340
 because I try dramatic 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:57.980
 Make up yourself rarely do all the quality 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.970
 cool shadows in this palette no cons 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.620
 the next palette is in my hands 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.280
 called disney chifles 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.500
 I will probably translate as 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.060
 truffle candy box yes there are 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.030
 truffles and 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:14.569
 this carriage contains plum 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.190
 shades if you like makeup with such 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:18.530
 shades I think you will like it 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.440
 in this palette the following shades 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.510
 light purple light plum or 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.760
 plum how penetrated chenki remind me 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.830
 I already began to forget Russian about me 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:33.139
 it seems he is not a clean plum drill in 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:35.840
 there is something else and then it goes dark 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:38.560
 plum so saturated will be similar to 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.840
 real plum know so ripe and 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:44.660
 also goes black shade it is satin in 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.150
 there are small spangles of particles 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.880
 some very small something similar to 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:53.030
 the previous black I said that there is 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.800
 little golden pieces right there they are 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.590
 silver seems to me 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.780
 blue or something else some common girls 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.180
 if you like shades and approximate 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.310
 to the color of the plum I think that this palette 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.639
 you will like it 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.830
 as for evening makeup as well if 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:11.780
 need to create some kind of 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.840
 image for example for a photo shoot not for 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:19.880
 some outfit before the event and need such 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:21.890
 Here are the shades that fit the way of the order 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.530
 well done here while going 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:27.140
 recorded and I always have everything out of hand 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:29.360
 falls and the palettes fell to the floor tfu tfu with 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:31.850
 nothing happened to them and 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:35.150
 preservation and finally girls and 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:37.850
 left the most delicious palette in 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.860
 quotes of course translate general 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:42.350
 called she answered zindan cho'gat 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:45.169
 translates as if into this attractive 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:48.560
 black chocolate but i think 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:51.710
 seductive too can be in general 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:55.760
 this palette with bronze shades here 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:56.990
 there is a light golden light and bronze 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.870
 gold shimmer 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.080
 dark bronze and brown dark 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.590
 brown 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:08.039
 your way is the only matte shade 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:10.289
 in all the palettes here this one I 

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:12.210
 most likely I will use too 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:12.870
 often because I love bronze 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:18.409
 shades 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:19.560
 gold and brown is that beautiful 

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:22.650
 made 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:25.710
 like a bar of black chocolate true and 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:28.620
 so in all these four palettes 16 

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:31.050
 shades and all the good pigmentation 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:33.539
 if you don't like shimmer shadows then 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:37.169
 Of course, you are unlikely to like them but 

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:38.490
 they are very good in quality 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:41.580
 convenient to take on the road you can 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:42.840
 put in a bag in a beautician easy and 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:45.139
 they look pretty 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:49.319
 attractive if you collect 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:50.129
 check those no I think that such here 

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:53.340
 palettes 

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:57.240
 one hundred percent of it will please the eye 

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.779
 and 1 palette from this company and I am not very 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.340
 happy

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:34.740
 enough just but we will move, I hope
