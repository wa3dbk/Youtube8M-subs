00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:06.080
 and the reason why I'm just going to 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:07.879
 talk about this topic is because the day 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.290
 last Thursday facebook deleted me for 

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:11.599
 always my facebook account without 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.250
 no reason whatsoever and he does not want me 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:14.750
 return and well it turns out that I do not use 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.700
 many social networks only use facebook 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.590
 because I have my work contacts and 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.790
 friendships etc neither of the shit 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.380
 of television so that's why I have not 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.550
 aware of this topic but it turns out that the 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.050
 yesterday a friend teaches me to the 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.130
 photography and he says hey color felipe 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.140
 I had this bullshit 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.340
 I said good I see him going up black and 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.290
 I also saw it in that color but they had 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.610
 two friends who saw white and gold 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.680
 apart from a friend who is so unique 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.070
 I saw coffee and pink but it is that apart from me 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.330
 I thought I was sleeping too 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.220
 but good from a little the benefit of 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.560
 the doubt then suddenly start to 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.210
 talk a little about theories that the 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.740
 who saw this colors looked sad the 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.180
 who saw this color was cheerful the one 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.620
 you see yellow or the face is not 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.480
 the one that comprises a little bit seven 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.950
 ports cojudeces and media 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.750
 supposedly on scientific grounds what 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.400
 that it seemed a reverend shit but 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.690
 good from village gel then when the 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.920
 I studied a friend a life that was there 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.360
 the computer showed me the photo of the 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.520
 dressed and when I saw him talking 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.989
 degree so I assumed that that dress 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.970
 it was retouched compared to the other 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.700
 but it was not like that he told me it was the 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.130
 same 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.110
 so when I stay watching for a while 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.479
 I realized that after the road over 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.830
 black and I stayed ok 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.750
 this huevada is an optical illusion 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.490
 and this bullshit has nothing to do 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.440
 with that the cornea opens up like that it embraces 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.690
 or you open your legs does not have anything 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.940
 what to see this bullshit is based on the 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.930
 perception of people according to 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.530
 the experiences they have had or 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.000
 simply when you have an image 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.260
 they imagine themselves in agreement in a 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.390
 visual experience that they have had and 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.119
 ended the matter that's all the 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.729
 illumination of both the background and 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.040
 forward makes anyone 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.390
 think that it is of such color and the world 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.130
 knows that the original color is blue and 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.899
 black for this reason this video is going to 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.369
 try on how to make people 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.380
 who see the dress in blue and black 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.909
 You can see it white and gold and 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.229
 those who sell dorado can see it from 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.450
 blue and black the application is very 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.850
 simple is only based on the perception and 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.290
 in the visual experience of each one and 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.610
 It is actually around the world people 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.500
 that the people who see the dress 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.080
 blue and black color when they see the image 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.970
 who are imagining that it's okay 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.770
 Illuminated the dress and how it is well 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.690
 illuminated it shows that it is blue black 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.940
 because it is hitting a direct light and 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.209
 warm to the dress so it also 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.890
 sees a slightly yellowish hue 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.019
 because it is the yellow one assumes 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.569
 true focus but the people that is 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.519
 white and gold are watching him thinking 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.860
 in which the lighting is behind since 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:28.200
 at the bottom of the picture you see 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.300
 a radiant lighting and this happens 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.340
 because the photograph was taken with a 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.270
 white balance saturation 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.220
 disastrous I do not think it was 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.620
 dedicated to photoshop was simply 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.970
 a terrible coincidence this illusion 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.400
 optics then there are people who in 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.710
 white and gold to see the color that 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.500
 they see white they are thinking they see 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.480
 in color with shadow by as much as what 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.520
 we see what he says to that he is white and the 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.050
 another one sees it golden because actually the 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.520
 black that looks a little movement there 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.470
 anyway I will try to put them 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.460
 an animation to see if they succeeded 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:08.979
 understand 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:08.979
 [Music] 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:55.670
 [Music] 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.400
 If they did not understand, repeat at this point 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:01.190
 video try to think what comes 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.019
 black groove that what they are seeing is 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.300
 white and gold according to which is a 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:06.680
 shadow by a backlight and 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.720
 those who see gold and white try 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.420
 thinking is also called front and 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.860
 that's why it's blue and black damn it 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.390
 so your cave is solved and they will be able to 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.100
 see the colors that chucha gives in the 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.479
 win by and on the subject of facebook 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.459
 facebook deleted my account for 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:21.440
 always for more than I sent them an email 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.840
 asking for the explanations they 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.340
 they responded with this supposedly 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.290
 my account does not meet the parameters for 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.000
 be on facebook and I do not 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.830
 can you say which are for issues 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.010
 of privacy can create similar 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.750
 stupidity fucking fucking facebook and mark 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.889
 shit zuckerber but good not 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.360
 matter anyway, I'm going to keep claiming 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:40.639

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.360
 fuck the fanpage since I administer 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.430

 is that I was pissed because I did not 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:17.710
 they let the video record so much noise that 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:21.420
 they make out here but 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.420
 they were only divided
