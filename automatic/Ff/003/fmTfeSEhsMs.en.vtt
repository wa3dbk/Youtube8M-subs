a video probably won't be that exciting
but<00:00:40.860> my<00:00:41.700> Al<00:00:42.060> Smith<00:00:42.330> here<00:00:42.660> my<00:00:42.900> water<00:00:43.500> heater

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
but my Al Smith here my water heater

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.260 
but my Al Smith here my water heater
here<00:00:43.950> my<00:00:44.070> gas-fired<00:00:44.460> water<00:00:44.550> heater<00:00:44.940> went<00:00:45.150> out

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
here my gas-fired water heater went out

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.570 
here my gas-fired water heater went out
and<00:00:45.420> this<00:00:45.510> happens<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:45.930> be<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.140> 50<00:00:47.130> gallon<00:00:47.280> water

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:47.580 
and this happens to be a 50 gallon water

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.100 
and this happens to be a 50 gallon water
heater<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.060> I<00:00:48.150> believe<00:00:48.390> we<00:00:48.540> installed<00:00:48.930> this

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110
