00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.990
 to be refreshed welcome to this new one 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:20.040
 video where I present you let's say it 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.320
 very modern map for the 1.4.2 thank you 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.149
 of course for the thousand members and al 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.000
 the sooner it comes we will say the truth 

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:30.660
 thanks but now I'll show you 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.120
 how the minimum race works because not 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.980
 he knew her this way adds well 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.480
 three functions in all three minecraft 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.399
 very useful 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.320
 first of all the thing to give a thing 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.310
 we say that it is the eye 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:48.300
 mini map in the upper right corner we can 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:53.370
 enlarge with the z button 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.560
 watch them you can enlarge up to 8 e 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.440
 then clicking them z 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:01.050
 come back then we have another 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.519
 that is, the function of having the 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:08.100
 more extensive map and it is very useful to say 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.090
 because to have the extended map one must 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.009
 kraft are there you need kraft arla but with 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.159
 this way you don't have to craft anything e 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:20.189
 you always have a learned map instead 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.710
 with us you can add waypoints an hour 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.060
 let me tell you what the practical waypoint is 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.679
 now I find myself close to the cows 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.959
 fiom which color I want blue is watched 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:35.100
 and added a point that I will always see 

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:37.859
 both in the let's say in the big map 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.350
 in fact walking he knew the point 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:42.709
 blue that you find from and gila I had created 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.770
 another point what if you see it there 

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:48.260
 and you will always see even the mini map 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.070
 then 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:54.530
 never lose that point and then with m 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.170
 you can have the menu to change 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:01.400
 let's say the options that I don't 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:07.100
 here you can put off remove a 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:10.040
 point if I don't like it and then here instead 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.810
 you can change the options if any 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.750
 I know something you do n't like or me 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:18.080
 find yourself well with some option i 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:22.610
 generally never 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:26.300
 let's say untidy on the out of file not 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:29.900
 I never changed the options because it goes 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.330
 see well as it is defined 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.980
 thank you for the next video 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.360
 thousand subscribers for views 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:41.900
 for the like and then I tell you that here is video 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:45.950
 on 1.4.2 I wrote that I am for the 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.420
 1.4.2 because they will be updated 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.300
 in a few hours because I was informed 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.700
 all will be updated in a few hours 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:55.370
 and then note how such by saying if 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.160
 parliament work 4.2 why not 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.440
 those who want and will work too much 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.280
