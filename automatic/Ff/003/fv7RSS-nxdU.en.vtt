00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:14.940
 iphone 5 as you can see 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.379
 I'm in Mexico from the iphone this was 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.160
 bought and again from the nightly sale 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.470
 tension 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.230
 it's a bit late they're close to 2 in 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.580
 the morning I come here after 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.340
 Acquire the product after about 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:31.330
 setbacks with the operator as 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:33.760
 you can see is the iphone white belt of 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.870
 session of 4 gigabytes and this a boxing 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.870
 something just for you 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:47.380
 Some phone features 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:50.010
 this includes iphones and ipods with double 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.010
 microphone 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:57.300
 the key looks good from more things 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.300
 confirming that according to box 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:23.320
 well there we have a new iphone we are going to 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:27.500
 see that take service 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:31.420
 but I feel very different the 4s 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.420
 very very nice root 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.940
 a little bit of the magic of the camera in 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.060
 half now 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.710
 in what are the explosion within the 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.460
 hearing aids and below 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.460
 and good 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.680
 compared to a 4 s 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.700
 if you keep spending the weight that is banal 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.049
 the iphone 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.049
 let 's put on the side 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.750
 here you can see 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.850
 the difference forgive the light is that 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:11.150
 I'm recording with one hand 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.400
 but yes yes good we will see that it has new 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.920
 iphone 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.920
 we can see the posts 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.760
 in the famous cable 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.200
 some I do not know anything of great taste guti 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.290
 but for us 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.599
 I am more the life that they have rose is the 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:33.580
 30 pint heater 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:36.909
 Here we have all this apparent good 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.599
 but in the end what interests them we are going to 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:39.599
 turn on the phone 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.319
 being true is that it is very living the 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.840
 new iphone 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:54.519
 he is very very cute 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.519
 I'm going to win some 4 that 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:02.950
 you eat enough 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.540
 well I'm a very fast video and 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.750
 we will have more videos about the new 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.750
 iphone 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.920
 Here are some pictures so they can 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.900
 appreciate it better the truth is very very 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.570
 pretty the phone can see lighting 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.980
 much smaller I really like the 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.320
 Detail of the banks looks very very 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.180
 cute and then the back is one of the 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.690
 better parts of the new iphone and access 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.160
 very very elegant is also this we 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.260
 I would give some small photos of the new 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.310
 connector that yes the truth is very very 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.040
 small compared to the previous one and then 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.480
 good is that reversible the bad thing is that 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.010
 Well, the products that you had with the 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.020
 another connector no longer serve and these are 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.170
 the spots that really sound very, very 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.170
 all right
