00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.159
 "Regeneration after sport without disturbing adaptation mechanisms" 

00:00:06.159 --> 00:00:10.387
 Runners participating in ultramarathon 

00:00:10.387 --> 00:00:13.348
 so many free radicals are created during the race 

00:00:13.348 --> 00:00:16.071
 that of a significant number of their cells 

00:00:16.071 --> 00:00:18.305
 DNA damage occurs. 

00:00:18.305 --> 00:00:21.738
 Some see the increase in free radicals in this 

00:00:21.738 --> 00:00:24.204
 which is induced by motion, a special paradox. 

00:00:24.204 --> 00:00:26.827
 How is it possible that clearly healthy activity, ie movement, 

00:00:26.827 --> 00:00:28.829
 has such a detrimental effect 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:30.781
 and causes damage to a variety of molecules and tissues? 

00:00:30.781 --> 00:00:33.414
 There is certainly a misunderstanding; 

00:00:33.414 --> 00:00:37.107
 Exercise alone may not necessarily be a healthy act 

00:00:37.107 --> 00:00:40.365
 especially beneficial is regeneration after exercise that has health benefits. 

00:00:40.365 --> 00:00:44.962
 It's just to say that "what doesn't kill us will make us stronger." 

00:00:44.962 --> 00:00:48.760
 There are other claims, for example, "During the exercise, 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.027
 that antioxidant protection has increased 

00:00:51.027 --> 00:00:54.031
 by increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes. " 

00:00:54.031 --> 00:00:57.298
 During racing, those who run ultramarathon can 

00:00:57.298 --> 00:00:58.898
 suffer some form of DNA interference. 

00:00:58.898 --> 00:01:01.529
 But let's review it a week later. 

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:03.551
 Six days after the race 

00:01:03.551 --> 00:01:06.555
 DNA damage level was not the same as the default 

00:01:06.555 --> 00:01:08.996
 but it was significantly lower 

00:01:08.996 --> 00:01:13.818
 probably because the cells have intensified their antioxidant defense. 

00:01:13.818 --> 00:01:17.873
 Thus, it is possible that exercise-induced oxidative damage is beneficial, 

00:01:17.873 --> 00:01:19.464
 like vaccination. 

00:01:19.464 --> 00:01:21.464
 Maybe a slight "bias of the body out of balance" 

00:01:21.464 --> 00:01:23.363
 we will induce such a response 

00:01:23.363 --> 00:01:26.097
 which is favorable in the long run. 

00:01:26.097 --> 00:01:29.333
 This mechanism that compensates for damage 

00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:31.833
 and can activate protection mechanisms 

00:01:31.833 --> 00:01:33.599
 we call it "hormÃ©za". 

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:37.901
 For example, herbicides cause plant death. 

00:01:37.901 --> 00:01:41.060
 But in low doses they can boost their growth. 

00:01:41.065 --> 00:01:43.100
 This is probably due to plant stress, 

00:01:43.107 --> 00:01:47.760
 which then mobilizes its resources for a successful fight. 

00:01:47.764 --> 00:01:50.130
 But let's stop for a while. 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.260
 May consume plant foods rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory ingredients 

00:01:55.263 --> 00:01:58.100
 to weaken this adaptation response? 

00:01:58.108 --> 00:02:01.750
 We have seen that berries alleviate inflammatory muscle damage 

00:02:01.753 --> 00:02:05.550
 and leafy vegetables reduce DNA damage by free radicals. 

00:02:05.551 --> 00:02:10.000
 Dark chocolate and tomato juice have similar effects. 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.500
 Flavonoid phytonutrients in fruits, vegetables and legumes 

00:02:14.506 --> 00:02:16.930
 apparently inhibit xanthine oxidase activity, 

00:02:16.933 --> 00:02:21.360
 which greatly contributes to the formation of free radicals during exercise. 

00:02:21.363 --> 00:02:23.620
 Carbohydrates in plant foods 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:25.730
 can reduce stress hormone levels. 

00:02:25.731 --> 00:02:30.230
 There was some theoretical concern in 1999. 

00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:33.960
 Perhaps making free radicals during exercise is a good thing 

00:02:33.967 --> 00:02:37.160
 and higher consumption of some antioxidants 

00:02:37.165 --> 00:02:41.630
 it can disrupt these necessary adaptation processes. 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.960
 Reduce tissue damage by free radicals 

00:02:44.964 --> 00:02:46.240
 then there may not be an increase 

00:02:46.242 --> 00:02:48.700
 antioxidant enzyme activities. 

00:02:48.703 --> 00:02:52.840
 Scientists responded 

00:02:52.848 --> 00:02:56.240
 that although it is likely 

00:02:56.247 --> 00:02:58.300
 That is, muscle damage, inflammation development, and oxidative stress 

00:02:58.305 --> 00:03:00.660
 important factors in the adaptation process, 

00:03:00.663 --> 00:03:03.440
 minimizing them can improve recovery 

00:03:03.448 --> 00:03:06.300
 that you can train more and perform better. 

00:03:06.305 --> 00:03:09.100
 Thus, on both sides, there are certain theories offering explanations. 

00:03:09.103 --> 00:03:13.570
 But how will this happen when we begin to examine it in more detail? 

00:03:13.571 --> 00:03:15.790
 What do the found data show? 

00:03:15.793 --> 00:03:19.970
 While antioxidants or dietary supplements with anti-inflammatory effect 

00:03:19.971 --> 00:03:22.830
 they can prevent these adaptation mechanisms, 

00:03:22.836 --> 00:03:25.240
 experts found that the extract of berries, 

00:03:25.243 --> 00:03:27.040
 specifically, blackcurrants in this study 

00:03:27.048 --> 00:03:28.870
 despite the high content of antioxidants 

00:03:28.871 --> 00:03:30.140
 and anti-inflammatory components, 

00:03:30.146 --> 00:03:33.580
 in fact, it has been highlighted 

00:03:33.582 --> 00:03:35.490
 health benefits of regular exercise. 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.870
 However, if you use antioxidants as food supplements, 

00:03:37.871 --> 00:03:40.140
 for example, vitamin C or E, 

00:03:40.146 --> 00:03:42.250
 thus reducing the effect of stress 

00:03:42.251 --> 00:03:43.440
 induced by exercise 

00:03:43.447 --> 00:03:47.150
 but at the same time you can block it 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:50.270
 the intrinsic antioxidant activity of the enzyme that is activated by the exercise. 

00:03:50.276 --> 00:03:52.770
 Maybe no support is needed, 

00:03:52.773 --> 00:03:54.620
 if there is no significant damage, 

00:03:54.625 --> 00:03:57.730
 but supplements with vitamin C may be the first 

00:03:57.732 --> 00:03:59.430
 negatively affect physical performance. 

00:03:59.432 --> 00:04:01.750
 However, from plant foods probably 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.270
 you get the best of both sides. 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.820
 Take a look at a recent study on lemon aloisia 

00:04:07.821 --> 00:04:10.140
 which is actually an antioxidant-rich herbal tea. 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.960
 Protects against oxidative damage 

00:04:11.968 --> 00:04:15.540
 reduces the symptoms of muscle damage and inflammation, 

00:04:15.547 --> 00:04:19.940
 all without blocking cellular adaptation during exercise. 

00:04:19.947 --> 00:04:21.420
 It turned out that aloisie lemon 

00:04:21.426 --> 00:04:25.170
 does not affect the increase in response 

00:04:25.171 --> 00:04:27.340
 antioxidant enzyme in the context of exercise. 

00:04:27.347 --> 00:04:30.750
 In contrast, glutathione reductase activity 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.060
 it was even higher in the group consuming this plant. 

00:04:33.068 --> 00:04:36.140
 The level of activity of antioxidant enzymes is evident here 

00:04:36.147 --> 00:04:38.700
 before and after 21 days of intensive jogging 

00:04:38.703 --> 00:04:41.470
 by the control group. 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.190
 Thanks to all the damaging radicals 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.160
 the body began to activate its antioxidant defense. 

00:04:47.161 --> 00:04:49.220
 But after eating green tea 

00:04:49.222 --> 00:04:52.090
 not only is the damage reduced 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.240
 thanks to antioxidant phytonutrients, 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:57.220
 moreover, defense is being strengthened, 

00:04:57.221 --> 00:05:04.160
 which is even better in this case.
