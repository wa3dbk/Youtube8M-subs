00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:06.180
 hello to all we find ourselves in front of a 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.710
 magic could shiny that I still sinned 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.040
 faster than I found this week 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.840
 lounes 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.450
 he fell after twelve fishing 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.469
 so I had already tested the oak 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.049
 card to see if it was always 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.609
 as fast as on pokemon x and y is 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.920
 it's always so fast I do not speak 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.949
 only for magicka javi venta cool 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.830
 also in 55 fishing so it's very very 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.960
 fast and there it suits me that it is 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.140
 fell fast enough because I wanted 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.079
 have a little gator milk in my 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.660
 team like on pokemon x and I had 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:41.460
 a gladiator so that's it if he's not 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.840
 if it's that bad in nature it could 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.050
 come with a team 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.730
 so let's go I'll send a 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.960
 huge bowl I redid a little bit 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:57.870

00:00:51.960 --> 00:01:00.329
 still not bought kronwall good at 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.399
 my opinion 8 it will not take 15 8 for 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.690
 catch 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.909
 by the way here is one honor bolt 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.650

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.020

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.680

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:15.180

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.310
 will give a nickname to that it's a 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.350
 backache and perfect male I 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:34.950
 could call him near rage like 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:42.829
 on pokemon x is what I had attached 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:47.759
 the sinking had tied the stallion 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:52.409
 raid rage cool it will only remain 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.990
 to evolve and for whom his pretty 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.670

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:00.090

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.560

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.590

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.579

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.900

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:57.190
 play in attack this pea a little bit 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.569
 but hey it would have been better if he had 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:03.430
 not there if he did not have a drop in 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:06.370
 attacks but hey, I'm going 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.870
 quickly go to the right for you 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.160
 show that and then I'll do my 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:16.599
 small backup and leave you there 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:18.420
 I should have healed him 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:23.280
 passage but hey it's okay 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.280

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.049
 female said white mustache 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:43.260
