you want to pick it up or not

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.609 
you want to pick it up or not
now<00:00:30.240> besides<00:00:30.630> having<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:31.019> incredibly<00:00:31.439> high

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
now besides having the incredibly high

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.170 
now besides having the incredibly high
slash<00:00:31.949> rating<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.340> also<00:00:32.460> has<00:00:32.669> an<00:00:32.759> incredibly

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
slash rating it also has an incredibly

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.810 
slash rating it also has an incredibly
high<00:00:33.390> status<00:00:33.989> chance<00:00:34.260> 50%<00:00:35.040> base<00:00:35.340> which<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.790> the

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
high status chance 50% base which is the

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.000 
high status chance 50% base which is the
highest<00:00:36.180> out<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.480> any<00:00:36.750> primary<00:00:37.170> in<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.739> game

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
highest out of any primary in the game

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.709 
highest out of any primary in the game
so<00:00:38.309> even<00:00:38.550> though<00:00:38.640> it's<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.820> single<00:00:39.120> shot<00:00:39.149> charge

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
so even though it's a single shot charge

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.930 
so even though it's a single shot charge
weapon<00:00:40.200> for<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.530> most<00:00:40.710> part<00:00:41.070> you<00:00:41.670> have<00:00:41.910> a

weapon for the most part you have a

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.670 
weapon for the most part you have a
really<00:00:42.390> good<00:00:42.660> chance<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.110> proc<00:00:43.379> in<00:00:43.559> your

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
really good chance of proc in your

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.380 
really good chance of proc in your
statuses<00:00:44.250> especially<00:00:44.760> when<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:44.940> incorporate

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
statuses especially when you incorporate

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.360 
statuses especially when you incorporate
the<00:00:45.539> dual<00:00:45.719> status<00:00:45.930> elements<00:00:46.739> onto<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.100> weapon

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
the dual status elements onto the weapon

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.709 
the dual status elements onto the weapon
but<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.670> feature<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:48.090> really<00:00:48.239> stands<00:00:48.600> out

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
but the feature that really stands out

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:49.880

center<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.020> your<00:01:19.259> crosshair<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:19.920> seems<00:01:20.100> to

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
center of your crosshair and it seems to

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.160 
center of your crosshair and it seems to
be<00:01:20.280> wildly<00:01:20.759> unstable<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.570> it's<00:01:21.720> definitely

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
be wildly unstable so it's definitely

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.140 
be wildly unstable so it's definitely
not<00:01:22.350> worth<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:23.040> damage<00:01:23.250> boost<00:01:23.700> because<00:01:23.909> the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
not worth the damage boost because the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.450 
not worth the damage boost because the
actually<00:01:24.659> loss<00:01:24.900> really<00:01:25.590> affects<00:01:25.920> this<00:01:26.070> weapon

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
actually loss really affects this weapon

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.830 
actually loss really affects this weapon

split chamber is always a nice mod to
have<00:01:42.780> on<00:01:42.960> because<00:01:43.290> basically<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:44.220> gives<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.490> a

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
instead of one per shot so basically

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.520 
instead of one per shot so basically
doubling<00:01:48.360> your<00:01:48.450> damage<00:01:48.840> like<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.049> 90<00:01:49.259> percent

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
chance of that and of course speed trick

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.609 
chance of that and of course speed trick
is<00:01:51.270> gonna<00:01:51.329> be<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.570> staple<00:01:51.840> too<00:01:52.290> because<00:01:52.530> it's

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
is gonna be a staple too because it's

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:53.990 
is gonna be a staple too because it's
just<00:01:52.710> gonna<00:01:52.860> really<00:01:53.159> speed<00:01:53.460> up<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.729> charge

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
just gonna really speed up that charge

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.819 
just gonna really speed up that charge
mechanic<00:01:54.540> which<00:01:54.869> is<00:01:54.960> gonna<00:01:55.110> be<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.350> primary

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
mechanic which is gonna be the primary

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.620 
mechanic which is gonna be the primary
use<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.549> weapon<00:01:56.909> because<00:01:57.119> not<00:01:57.299> only<00:01:57.509> to

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
use of the weapon because not only to

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.880 
use of the weapon because not only to
get<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.899> innate<00:01:58.140> punch<00:01:58.409> through<00:01:58.649> like<00:01:58.799> I

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
get that innate punch through like I

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.170 
get that innate punch through like I
already<00:01:58.979> mentioned<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.610> usually<00:02:00.030> charge

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
already mentioned I usually charge

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.760 
already mentioned I usually charge
mechanic<00:02:00.600> but<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:00.810> greatly<00:02:01.079> increases<00:02:01.619> your

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
mechanic but it greatly increases your

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.490 
mechanic but it greatly increases your
overall<00:02:01.799> damage<00:02:02.700> as<00:02:02.850> well<00:02:03.270> which<00:02:03.570> is<00:02:03.719> actually

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
overall damage as well which is actually

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.410 
overall damage as well which is actually
better<00:02:04.799> DPS<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.520> just<00:02:05.640> spamming<00:02:06.000> out<00:02:06.270> the

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
better DPS and just spamming out the

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.359 
better DPS and just spamming out the
blades<00:02:06.689> themselves<00:02:07.439> so<00:02:07.649> just<00:02:07.829> take<00:02:08.160> note<00:02:08.340> of

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
she based off of the charge mechanic

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.089 
she based off of the charge mechanic
damage<00:02:15.720> so<00:02:16.080> just<00:02:16.260> take<00:02:16.409> note<00:02:16.440> of<00:02:16.620> that<00:02:16.769> and<00:02:16.890> the

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
status now and as it turns out when

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.250 
status now and as it turns out when
you're<00:02:20.940> using<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.420> charge<00:02:21.659> mechanic<00:02:22.049> it<00:02:22.140> will

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
you're using the charge mechanic it will

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.559 
you're using the charge mechanic it will
boost<00:02:22.680> up<00:02:22.890> your<00:02:23.010> status<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.849> point<00:02:24.150> where

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.360 
boost up your status to the point where
you<00:02:24.629> only<00:02:24.810> need<00:02:25.080> two<00:02:25.379> of<00:02:25.409> the<00:02:25.860> dual<00:02:26.040> status

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
you only need two of the dual status

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.880 
you only need two of the dual status
elements<00:02:27.110> including<00:02:28.110> your<00:02:28.230> split<00:02:28.500> chambers

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
elements including your split chambers

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.080

so<00:02:29.040> I'll<00:02:29.340> just<00:02:29.519> show<00:02:29.610> it<00:02:29.640> I'm<00:02:29.790> talking<00:02:29.909> about

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
so I'll just show it I'm talking about

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.970 
so I'll just show it I'm talking about
remove<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.659> split<00:02:30.900> chamber<00:02:31.079> I'm<00:02:31.530> still<00:02:31.860> at

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
remove the split chamber I'm still at

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.819 
remove the split chamber I'm still at
100%<00:02:32.310> if<00:02:32.760> I<00:02:33.030> remove<00:02:33.299> one<00:02:33.329> of<00:02:33.629> these<00:02:33.829> status

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
100% if I remove one of these status

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:37.750 
100% if I remove one of these status
mods<00:02:35.069> I'm<00:02:35.310> down<00:02:35.549> to<00:02:35.700> 80%<00:02:36.030> if<00:02:36.569> I<00:02:36.900> put<00:02:37.110> it<00:02:37.200> back<00:02:37.379> on

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
mods I'm down to 80% if I put it back on

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.490 
mods I'm down to 80% if I put it back on
so<00:02:38.760> here<00:02:39.030> it<00:02:39.090> is<00:02:39.180> right<00:02:39.299> here<00:02:39.360> I<00:02:39.690> go<00:02:40.140> up<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.319> a

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
so here it is right here I go up to a

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.960 
so here it is right here I go up to a
hundred<00:02:40.890> percent<00:02:41.250> so<00:02:41.400> that's<00:02:41.549> not<00:02:41.730> even

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
hundred percent so that's not even

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.280 
hundred percent so that's not even
factoring<00:02:42.180> in<00:02:42.450> probability<00:02:42.989> I'm<00:02:43.110> just

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
factoring in probability I'm just

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.960 
factoring in probability I'm just
straight<00:02:43.590> up<00:02:43.620> at<00:02:43.920> a<00:02:44.159> hundred<00:02:44.400> percent<00:02:44.549> with

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
straight up at a hundred percent with

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.430 
straight up at a hundred percent with
the<00:02:45.030> charge<00:02:45.450> mechanic<00:02:45.959> and<00:02:46.079> I'll<00:02:46.140> just<00:02:46.230> put<00:02:46.410> on

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
the charge mechanic and I'll just put on

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.289 
the charge mechanic and I'll just put on
my<00:02:46.530> split<00:02:46.859> chamber<00:02:47.220> back<00:02:47.430> right<00:02:47.730> there<00:02:47.910> so

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
my split chamber back right there so

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:49.789 
my split chamber back right there so
because<00:02:48.450> of<00:02:48.720> this<00:02:48.810> we're<00:02:49.200> gonna<00:02:49.319> be<00:02:49.470> running

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
because of this we're gonna be running

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.190 
because of this we're gonna be running
to<00:02:50.099> regular<00:02:50.640> elements<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:51.209> to<00:02:51.420> dual<00:02:51.780> set<00:02:52.049> of

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
to regular elements and to dual set of

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.630 
to regular elements and to dual set of
elements<00:02:52.560> for<00:02:52.680> our<00:02:52.859> bills<00:02:53.129> just<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.489> help

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
elements for our bills just to help

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.490 
elements for our bills just to help
maximize<00:02:54.239> our<00:02:54.510> damage<00:02:54.780> a<00:02:54.870> bit<00:02:55.019> more<00:02:55.200> because

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
maximize our damage a bit more because

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.130 
maximize our damage a bit more because
the<00:02:55.620> regular<00:02:55.920> illness<00:02:56.250> offer<00:02:56.489> 30%<00:02:57.480> more<00:02:57.780> top

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
the regular illness offer 30% more top

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.930 
the regular illness offer 30% more top
end<00:02:58.170> damage<00:02:58.620> so<00:02:59.190> it's<00:02:59.340> gonna<00:02:59.430> work<00:02:59.670> out<00:02:59.819> really

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
end damage so it's gonna work out really

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.580 
end damage so it's gonna work out really
well<00:03:00.150> but<00:03:00.329> for<00:03:00.480> actually<00:03:00.900> our<00:03:01.230> actual

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
well but for actually our actual

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.649 
well but for actually our actual
elements<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.430> first<00:03:02.609> one<00:03:02.879> is<00:03:02.970> config<00:03:03.329> a<00:03:03.450> for

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
elements the first one is config a for

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:05.149 
elements the first one is config a for
the<00:03:03.720> grenier<00:03:03.989> we're<00:03:04.109> gonna<00:03:04.200> want<00:03:04.440> a<00:03:04.530> radiation

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 
the grenier we're gonna want a radiation

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:07.399 
the grenier we're gonna want a radiation
combo<00:03:05.489> first<00:03:05.730> so<00:03:05.909> electric<00:03:06.390> plus<00:03:06.930> fire<00:03:07.230> will

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:07.409 
combo first so electric plus fire will

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:08.839 
combo first so electric plus fire will
give<00:03:07.560> us<00:03:07.709> that<00:03:07.920> good<00:03:08.280> against<00:03:08.459> the<00:03:08.579> alloy

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
give us that good against the alloy

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:10.460 
give us that good against the alloy
target<00:03:09.209> units<00:03:09.450> for<00:03:09.569> the<00:03:09.659> heavy<00:03:09.840> units<00:03:10.319> and

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
target units for the heavy units and

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.550 
target units for the heavy units and
then<00:03:10.890> viral<00:03:11.400> which<00:03:11.700> is<00:03:11.849> toxic<00:03:12.120> plus<00:03:12.569> ice<00:03:12.810> will

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
then viral which is toxic plus ice will

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.990 
then viral which is toxic plus ice will
affect<00:03:13.859> the<00:03:13.980> entire<00:03:14.190> faction<00:03:14.549> because<00:03:14.909> it

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
affect the entire faction because it

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.880 
affect the entire faction because it
affects<00:03:15.239> clone<00:03:15.480> flesh<00:03:15.810> but<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.349> primary<00:03:16.620> use

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
affects clone flesh but the primary use

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.920 
affects clone flesh but the primary use
of<00:03:16.920> this<00:03:17.190> is<00:03:17.400> for<00:03:17.730> that<00:03:17.910> proc<00:03:18.389> which<00:03:18.690> basically

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
of this is for that proc which basically

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.199 
of this is for that proc which basically
halves<00:03:19.319> enemies<00:03:19.829> HP<00:03:20.190> after<00:03:20.400> six<00:03:20.849> seconds

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
halves enemies HP after six seconds

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:22.759 
halves enemies HP after six seconds
which<00:03:21.359> is<00:03:21.480> amazing<00:03:22.049> especially<00:03:22.410> for<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.590> leg

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
which is amazing especially for the leg

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.890 
which is amazing especially for the leg
game<00:03:22.980> moving<00:03:23.700> on<00:03:23.790> to<00:03:23.880> config<00:03:24.239> be<00:03:24.480> though<00:03:24.690> which

is the corpus for corpus we're first

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.030 
is the corpus for corpus we're first
gonna<00:03:27.030> want<00:03:27.299> our<00:03:27.389> magnetic<00:03:28.019> so<00:03:28.230> take<00:03:28.680> note<00:03:28.889> I'm

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
gonna want our magnetic so take note I'm

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.619 
gonna want our magnetic so take note I'm
using<00:03:29.220> rhyme<00:03:29.579> rounds<00:03:29.910> and<00:03:30.060> my<00:03:30.120> malignant

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:30.629 
using rhyme rounds and my malignant

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:34.129 
using rhyme rounds and my malignant
force<00:03:30.900> as<00:03:31.169> my<00:03:31.769> dual<00:03:32.310> said<00:03:32.609> elements<00:03:33.139> and

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
force as my dual said elements and

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:35.390 
force as my dual said elements and
basically<00:03:34.470> though<00:03:34.680> but<00:03:34.889> so<00:03:35.010> I'm<00:03:35.099> brewing<00:03:35.250> is

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
basically though but so I'm brewing is

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.470 
basically though but so I'm brewing is
going<00:03:35.519> to<00:03:35.579> combine<00:03:35.700> with<00:03:35.940> Ryan<00:03:36.180> rounds<00:03:36.419> to

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
going to combine with Ryan rounds to

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.909 
going to combine with Ryan rounds to
give<00:03:36.629> me<00:03:36.690> that<00:03:36.810> magnetic<00:03:37.440> and<00:03:37.620> then

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:37.919 
give me that magnetic and then

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:40.250 
give me that magnetic and then
Millennium<00:03:38.639> Force<00:03:38.819> is<00:03:39.120> gonna<00:03:39.299> double<00:03:39.930> up<00:03:40.049> on

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
Millennium Force is gonna double up on

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.379 
Millennium Force is gonna double up on
toxic<00:03:40.769> with<00:03:40.919> infected<00:03:41.280> clip<00:03:41.669> because<00:03:41.819> toxic

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
toxic with infected clip because toxic

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.000 
toxic with infected clip because toxic
by<00:03:42.510> itself<00:03:42.720> will<00:03:42.900> go<00:03:42.989> through<00:03:43.349> shields<00:03:43.829> and

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
by itself will go through shields and

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.460 
by itself will go through shields and
proto<00:03:44.340> shows<00:03:44.699> so<00:03:45.150> it's<00:03:45.269> the<00:03:45.389> best<00:03:45.599> way<00:03:45.870> against

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
proto shows so it's the best way against

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.110 
proto shows so it's the best way against
that<00:03:46.590> faction<00:03:47.069> because<00:03:47.160> toxic<00:03:47.940> just

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
that faction because toxic just

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.689 
that faction because toxic just
absolutely<00:03:48.599> wrecks<00:03:48.959> the<00:03:49.199> corpus<00:03:49.680> going<00:03:50.519> on<00:03:50.609> to

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:50.699 
absolutely wrecks the corpus going on to

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:52.369 
absolutely wrecks the corpus going on to
our<00:03:50.790> final<00:03:51.030> config<00:03:51.540> though<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:51.900> first<00:03:52.109> one<00:03:52.290> is

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
our final config though the first one is

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:55.189 
our final config though the first one is
for<00:03:52.560> infested<00:03:53.220> we're<00:03:53.579> gonna<00:03:53.699> want<00:03:54.000> our<00:03:54.199> base

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:55.199 
for infested we're gonna want our base

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:56.780 
for infested we're gonna want our base
our<00:03:55.349> corrosive<00:03:55.949> first<00:03:56.160> which<00:03:56.340> is<00:03:56.489> really<00:03:56.669> good

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
our corrosive first which is really good

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.580 
our corrosive first which is really good
against<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.150> ancients<00:03:57.870> and<00:03:58.199> I'm<00:03:58.290> gonna<00:03:58.410> make

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
against the ancients and I'm gonna make

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.949 
against the ancients and I'm gonna make
blast<00:03:58.980> after<00:03:59.280> that<00:03:59.549> which<00:03:59.760> is<00:03:59.970> ice<00:04:00.209> plus<00:04:00.629> fire

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
blast after that which is ice plus fire

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.990 
blast after that which is ice plus fire
which<00:04:01.440> has<00:04:01.620> that<00:04:01.739> nice<00:04:01.949> knockdown<00:04:02.459> effect<00:04:02.819> as

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
which has that nice knockdown effect as

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.920 
which has that nice knockdown effect as
well

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
well

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.409 
well
when<00:04:04.290> it<00:04:04.410> procs<00:04:04.739> so<00:04:05.010> but<00:04:05.639> also<00:04:05.849> plastic<00:04:06.209> is

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:06.419 
when it procs so but also plastic is

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:07.670 
when it procs so but also plastic is
really<00:04:06.480> good<00:04:06.780> damage<00:04:06.930> against<00:04:07.199> the<00:04:07.290> ancients

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
really good damage against the ancients

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.349 
really good damage against the ancients
so<00:04:07.739> just<00:04:07.949> pure<00:04:08.310> focused<00:04:08.760> damage<00:04:08.970> against<00:04:09.209> them

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
so just pure focused damage against them

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:10.939 
so just pure focused damage against them
because<00:04:09.569> they're<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:09.780> problematic<00:04:10.319> targets

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:10.949 
because they're the problematic targets

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:12.920 
because they're the problematic targets
in<00:04:11.069> that<00:04:11.489> faction<00:04:11.910> and<00:04:12.090> then<00:04:12.389> for<00:04:12.599> the<00:04:12.690> voids

in that faction and then for the voids
what<00:04:13.139> we're<00:04:13.230> gonna<00:04:13.319> want<00:04:13.560> to<00:04:13.590> do<00:04:13.680> is<00:04:13.799> remove

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
what we're gonna want to do is remove

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.039 
what we're gonna want to do is remove
both<00:04:14.340> these<00:04:14.609> mods<00:04:14.970> and<00:04:15.269> we're<00:04:15.599> gonna<00:04:15.720> first

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
both these mods and we're gonna first

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.110 
both these mods and we're gonna first
want<00:04:16.260> to<00:04:16.320> put<00:04:16.470> on<00:04:16.590> our<00:04:16.799> high<00:04:17.010> voltage<00:04:17.579> and<00:04:17.729> then

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
want to put on our high voltage and then

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.460 
want to put on our high voltage and then
we're<00:04:18.209> going<00:04:18.329> to<00:04:18.389> look<00:04:18.539> for<00:04:18.840> our<00:04:18.870> infected

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
we're going to look for our infected

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.289 
we're going to look for our infected
clip<00:04:19.979> and<00:04:20.220> now<00:04:20.250> this<00:04:20.880> wait<00:04:21.090> we're<00:04:21.269> just

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
clip and now this wait we're just

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:22.730 
clip and now this wait we're just
getting<00:04:21.630> straight-up<00:04:22.049> corrosive<00:04:22.710> damage

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
getting straight-up corrosive damage

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.680 
getting straight-up corrosive damage
which<00:04:23.580> will<00:04:23.880> work<00:04:24.060> really<00:04:24.270> well<00:04:24.419> because

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
which will work really well because

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:25.790 
which will work really well because
again<00:04:25.020> we<00:04:25.140> don't<00:04:25.229> have<00:04:25.380> to<00:04:25.560> worry<00:04:25.710> about

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
again we don't have to worry about

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.140 
again we don't have to worry about
putting<00:04:26.219> on<00:04:26.340> our<00:04:26.370> thermite<00:04:26.849> round

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
putting on our thermite round

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.760 
putting on our thermite round
for<00:04:27.270> extra<00:04:27.570> status<00:04:27.840> we're<00:04:28.199> already<00:04:28.410> a<00:04:28.500> hundred

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
for extra status we're already a hundred

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.730 
for extra status we're already a hundred
percent<00:04:28.830> so<00:04:29.400> we<00:04:29.460> just<00:04:29.610> put<00:04:29.850> all<00:04:30.030> into

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
percent so we just put all into

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.540 
percent so we just put all into
corrosive<00:04:31.740> and<00:04:31.830> that's<00:04:31.979> gonna<00:04:32.100> be<00:04:32.250> the<00:04:32.340> best

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
corrosive and that's gonna be the best

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.010 
corrosive and that's gonna be the best
way<00:04:32.850> of<00:04:32.880> taking<00:04:33.270> down<00:04:33.389> those<00:04:33.509> heavy<00:04:33.750> gunners

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
way of taking down those heavy gunners

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.480 
way of taking down those heavy gunners
and<00:04:34.530> one<00:04:34.710> thing<00:04:34.889> I<00:04:34.949> will<00:04:35.100> say<00:04:35.130> about<00:04:35.310> the

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
and one thing I will say about the

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.340 
and one thing I will say about the
weapon<00:04:35.759> too<00:04:35.850> is<00:04:36.000> is<00:04:36.120> definitely<00:04:36.600> situational

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
weapon too is is definitely situational

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.659 
weapon too is is definitely situational
in<00:04:37.440> certain<00:04:37.740> warframes<00:04:38.130> will<00:04:38.310> take<00:04:38.490> more

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
in certain warframes will take more

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:40.340 
in certain warframes will take more
kindly<00:04:39.120> to<00:04:39.330> it<00:04:39.360> than<00:04:39.630> others<00:04:39.990> like<00:04:40.020> you've

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
kindly to it than others like you've

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.350 
kindly to it than others like you've
been<00:04:40.410> seeing<00:04:40.620> a<00:04:40.710> lot<00:04:40.830> of<00:04:40.860> Bob<00:04:41.160> and<00:04:41.430> play<00:04:41.970> with

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
been seeing a lot of Bob and play with

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.879 
been seeing a lot of Bob and play with
this<00:04:42.570> weapon<00:04:42.780> and<00:04:43.199> he's<00:04:43.470> probably<00:04:43.620> the<00:04:43.860> best

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
this weapon and he's probably the best

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:45.650 
this weapon and he's probably the best
frame<00:04:44.370> for<00:04:44.639> it<00:04:44.669> just<00:04:44.850> because<00:04:45.120> of<00:04:45.240> his<00:04:45.360> vortex

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
frame for it just because of his vortex

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.300 
frame for it just because of his vortex
being<00:04:46.139> able<00:04:46.259> to<00:04:46.350> gather<00:04:46.590> a<00:04:46.770> bunch<00:04:46.889> of<00:04:47.009> enemies

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
being able to gather a bunch of enemies

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.439 
being able to gather a bunch of enemies
into<00:04:47.490> a<00:04:47.550> ball<00:04:47.850> and<00:04:47.880> then<00:04:48.120> you<00:04:48.180> can<00:04:48.300> basically

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:48.449 
into a ball and then you can basically

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:50.090 
into a ball and then you can basically
one-shot<00:04:49.169> them<00:04:49.350> at<00:04:49.440> that<00:04:49.530> point<00:04:49.740> because<00:04:50.070> of

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
one-shot them at that point because of

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.710 
one-shot them at that point because of
the<00:04:50.220> five<00:04:50.430> meter<00:04:50.610> punch<00:04:50.970> through<00:04:51.210> another

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
the five meter punch through another

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.840 
the five meter punch through another
good<00:04:51.900> example<00:04:51.930> though<00:04:52.470> can<00:04:52.650> be<00:04:52.680> mag<00:04:53.550> with<00:04:53.759> her

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
good example though can be mag with her

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.219 
good example though can be mag with her
bullet<00:04:54.210> attractors<00:04:54.720> the<00:04:54.840> blades<00:04:55.080> can

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 
bullet attractors the blades can

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:56.840 
bullet attractors the blades can
actually<00:04:55.620> hit<00:04:55.770> the<00:04:55.919> bubble<00:04:56.190> multiple<00:04:56.580> times

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
actually hit the bubble multiple times

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.700 
actually hit the bubble multiple times
in<00:04:57.060> one<00:04:57.270> shot<00:04:57.600> so<00:04:57.630> you<00:04:57.840> definitely<00:04:58.020> rack<00:04:58.440> up<00:04:58.650> a

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
in one shot so you definitely rack up a

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.320 
in one shot so you definitely rack up a
lot<00:04:58.740> of<00:04:58.949> damage<00:04:59.280> that<00:04:59.310> way<00:04:59.699> I<00:04:59.880> think<00:05:00.000> more<00:05:00.300> than

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
lot of damage that way I think more than

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:01.580 
lot of damage that way I think more than
anything<00:05:00.660> it<00:05:00.870> comes<00:05:01.080> down<00:05:01.229> to<00:05:01.380> personal

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
anything it comes down to personal

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.500 
anything it comes down to personal
preference<00:05:02.160> because<00:05:02.669> in<00:05:02.820> the<00:05:02.940> right<00:05:03.120> hands

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
preference because in the right hands

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.090 
preference because in the right hands
the<00:05:03.570> weapon<00:05:03.840> can<00:05:03.930> do<00:05:04.050> a<00:05:04.080> lot<00:05:04.440> of<00:05:04.620> damage<00:05:05.070> so

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
the weapon can do a lot of damage so

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.379 
the weapon can do a lot of damage so
it's<00:05:05.490> one<00:05:05.639> of<00:05:05.729> those<00:05:05.820> things<00:05:06.030> where<00:05:06.210> players

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
it's one of those things where players

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:07.879 
it's one of those things where players
will<00:05:06.510> either<00:05:06.720> absolutely<00:05:07.289> love<00:05:07.590> it<00:05:07.740> or<00:05:07.860> hate

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:07.889 
will either absolutely love it or hate

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:09.560 
will either absolutely love it or hate
it<00:05:08.340> I<00:05:08.430> think<00:05:08.729> but<00:05:08.910> you<00:05:09.000> didn't<00:05:09.240> not<00:05:09.360> me<00:05:09.479> know
