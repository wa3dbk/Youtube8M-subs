both<00:03:54.189> of<00:03:54.250> these<00:03:54.610> cards

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
both of these cards

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.500 
both of these cards
puts<00:03:55.780> them<00:03:55.989> in<00:03:56.230> one<00:03:56.560> card<00:03:56.860> and<00:03:57.129> while<00:03:57.969> it's<00:03:58.239> not

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
puts them in one card and while it's not

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.030 
puts them in one card and while it's not
quite<00:03:58.959> as<00:03:59.200> strong<00:04:00.159> at<00:04:00.459> either<00:04:00.790> particular<00:04:01.629> job

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
quite as strong at either particular job

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.520 
quite as strong at either particular job
it's<00:04:03.040> the<00:04:03.310> fact<00:04:03.609> that<00:04:03.790> it<00:04:04.120> does<00:04:04.420> do<00:04:04.750> both<00:04:05.079> that

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
it's the fact that it does do both that

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.880 
it's the fact that it does do both that
makes<00:04:05.799> it<00:04:05.950> a<00:04:06.040> good<00:04:06.219> car<00:04:07.379> expect<00:04:08.379> a<00:04:08.530> surge<00:04:08.859> in

makes it a good car expect a surge in

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.390 
makes it a good car expect a surge in
