the pan I normally cook with the number
8<00:01:09.299> but<00:01:10.299> here<00:01:10.450> it<00:01:10.539> is<00:01:10.600> inside<00:01:10.990> the<00:01:11.229> the<00:01:11.619> number

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
8 but here it is inside the the number

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.389 
8 but here it is inside the the number
10<00:01:12.130> and<00:01:13.049> you<00:01:14.049> can<00:01:14.079> see<00:01:14.350> a<00:01:14.380> big<00:01:14.920> difference<00:01:14.950> here

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
10 and you can see a big difference here

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:16.889 
10 and you can see a big difference here
the<00:01:15.579> number<00:01:15.759> 10<00:01:15.939> is<00:01:16.030> really<00:01:16.299> really<00:01:16.479> heavy<00:01:16.659> too

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:16.899 
the number 10 is really really heavy too

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:19.560 
the number 10 is really really heavy too
so<00:01:17.770> we're<00:01:17.979> gonna<00:01:18.070> go<00:01:18.280> ahead<00:01:18.369> and<00:01:18.729> get<00:01:19.210> our

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.609 
butter going we're gonna do the eggs
first<00:01:24.299> so<00:01:25.299> once<00:01:25.450> your<00:01:25.569> pans<00:01:25.810> warm<00:01:26.140> put<00:01:26.500> your

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
eggs in scrambled eggs just use a little

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:34.679 
eggs in scrambled eggs just use a little
bit<00:01:32.710> lower<00:01:32.890> than<00:01:32.950> medium<00:01:33.340> heat<00:01:33.579> and<00:01:33.850> just<00:01:33.880> keep

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 
bit lower than medium heat and just keep

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:35.850 
bit lower than medium heat and just keep
stirring<00:01:35.020> them<00:01:35.110> around<00:01:35.259> until<00:01:35.469> they<00:01:35.740> get

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
stirring them around until they get

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:43.800 
stirring them around until they get
cooked<00:01:36.869> magically<00:01:37.869> done<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:43.329> here<00:01:43.630> we<00:01:43.720> go

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
cooked magically done and here we go

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.809 
cooked magically done and here we go
with<00:01:43.990> our<00:01:44.110> griddle<00:01:44.619> so<00:01:44.799> once<00:01:45.399> our<00:01:45.490> griddle

00:01:45.809 --> 00:01:45.819 
with our griddle so once our griddle

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:48.449 
with our griddle so once our griddle
gets<00:01:45.939> warmed<00:01:46.240> up<00:01:46.329> to<00:01:46.599> about<00:01:46.810> say<00:01:47.459> medium-high

00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:48.459 
gets warmed up to about say medium-high

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:48.690 
gets warmed up to about say medium-high
heat

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
heat

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.240 
heat
go<00:01:49.420> ahead<00:01:49.539> and<00:01:49.630> throw<00:01:50.110> the<00:01:50.229> meat<00:01:50.380> on<00:01:50.560> and<00:01:51.130> can

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
go ahead and throw the meat on and can

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.499 
go ahead and throw the meat on and can
really<00:01:51.399> see<00:01:51.579> how<00:01:51.700> much<00:01:51.819> the<00:01:52.000> meat<00:01:52.149> shrinks

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
really see how much the meat shrinks

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.969 
really see how much the meat shrinks
there<00:01:55.229> so<00:01:56.229> these<00:01:56.319> things<00:01:56.500> cook<00:01:56.770> fairly

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
quickly about three minutes on each side

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:05.010 
quickly about three minutes on each side
and<00:01:59.739> you<00:01:59.829> should<00:02:00.819> be<00:02:01.090> good<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.780> you<00:02:04.840> can

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
and you should be good and you can

and you should be good and you can
either<00:02:05.110> chop<00:02:05.709> this<00:02:05.979> meat<00:02:06.220> up<00:02:06.369> or<00:02:06.610> you<00:02:06.939> can<00:02:07.060> just

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
either chop this meat up or you can just

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.729 
either chop this meat up or you can just
throw<00:02:07.509> it<00:02:07.539> on<00:02:07.689> here<00:02:07.869> like<00:02:07.899> this<00:02:08.170> and<00:02:08.380> then<00:02:08.470> chop

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
throw it on here like this and then chop

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.870 
throw it on here like this and then chop
it<00:02:08.769> up<00:02:08.950> later<00:02:09.160> which<00:02:09.340> is<00:02:09.489> what<00:02:09.639> I<00:02:09.670> did<00:02:11.880> all

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
it up later which is what I did all

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.240 
it up later which is what I did all
right<00:02:13.000> so<00:02:13.180> here's<00:02:13.359> the<00:02:13.420> last<00:02:13.569> piece<00:02:13.810> done<00:02:14.250> and

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
right so here's the last piece done and

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.949 
right so here's the last piece done and
it<00:02:15.370> smells<00:02:15.609> really<00:02:15.850> good<00:02:16.260> look<00:02:17.260> at<00:02:17.350> that<00:02:18.959> so

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
it smells really good look at that so

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.900 
it smells really good look at that so
I'm<00:02:20.049> gonna<00:02:20.139> go<00:02:20.319> ahead<00:02:20.410> and<00:02:20.530> saute<00:02:21.160> the<00:02:21.549> onions

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
I'm gonna go ahead and saute the onions

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.870 
I'm gonna go ahead and saute the onions
on<00:02:22.209> the<00:02:22.810> griddle<00:02:23.049> just<00:02:23.410> to<00:02:23.500> help<00:02:23.709> try<00:02:24.579> to<00:02:24.639> get

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
on the griddle just to help try to get

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.440 
on the griddle just to help try to get
some<00:02:25.060> of<00:02:25.180> this<00:02:25.590> residue<00:02:26.819> off<00:02:27.819> that<00:02:28.209> was<00:02:28.299> left

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
some of this residue off that was left

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.770 
some of this residue off that was left
over<00:02:28.569> by<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:28.810> meat<00:02:33.389> and<00:02:34.389> it's<00:02:34.540> a<00:02:34.630> little

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
over by the meat and it's a little

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.170 
over by the meat and it's a little
difficult<00:02:35.019> to<00:02:35.470> saute<00:02:36.459> on<00:02:36.609> this<00:02:36.760> thing<00:02:36.970> but

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
difficult to saute on this thing but

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.020 
difficult to saute on this thing but
it's<00:02:37.480> doable<00:02:38.370> just<00:02:39.370> because<00:02:39.609> of<00:02:39.730> this<00:02:39.819> it

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
it's doable just because of this it

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.199 
it's doable just because of this it
doesn't<00:02:40.239> have<00:02:40.359> sides

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
doesn't have sides

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.030 
doesn't have sides
so<00:02:43.209> we're<00:02:43.390> gonna<00:02:43.480> got<00:02:43.659> them<00:02:43.750> spread<00:02:44.019> out<00:02:44.049> I'm

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
so we're gonna got them spread out I'm

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.220 
so we're gonna got them spread out I'm
gonna<00:02:45.310> do<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.640> bell<00:02:45.939> peppers<00:02:46.329> and<00:02:46.540> the

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
gonna do the bell peppers and the

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:54.030 
gonna do the bell peppers and the
skillet<00:02:47.590> here<00:02:52.469> and<00:02:53.469> remember<00:02:53.620> when<00:02:53.890> we're

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
skillet here and remember when we're

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.039 
skillet here and remember when we're
sauteing<00:02:54.519> we<00:02:55.030> want<00:02:55.180> to<00:02:55.239> maintain<00:02:55.359> a<00:02:55.569> high<00:02:55.780> heat

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
sauteing we want to maintain a high heat

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.920 
sauteing we want to maintain a high heat
it's<00:02:56.799> that<00:02:57.040> way<00:02:57.159> they<00:02:57.400> they<00:02:57.819> cook<00:02:58.390> but<00:02:58.810> they

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
it's that way they they cook but they

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.770 
it's that way they they cook but they
stay<00:02:59.140> crisp<00:02:59.590> and<00:02:59.769> firm<00:03:00.010> if<00:03:00.849> you<00:03:01.000> using<00:03:01.359> too<00:03:01.629> low

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
stay crisp and firm if you using too low

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.000 
stay crisp and firm if you using too low
of<00:03:01.870> a<00:03:01.930> heat<00:03:02.079> and<00:03:02.260> that<00:03:02.349> just<00:03:02.530> ends<00:03:02.739> up<00:03:02.799> like

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
of a heat and that just ends up like

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:09.679 
of a heat and that just ends up like
steaming<00:03:03.310> them<00:03:06.540> onions<00:03:07.540> are<00:03:07.629> looking<00:03:07.870> good
