other improvements on this latest model

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.479 
other improvements on this latest model
include<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:49.050> slightly<00:00:49.379> higher<00:00:49.680> ISO<00:00:50.160> range

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
include a slightly higher ISO range

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.600 
include a slightly higher ISO range
which<00:00:50.730> runs<00:00:50.940> from<00:00:51.120> 100<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:52.230> 6400<00:00:52.800> if<00:00:53.280> you

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
which runs from 100 to 6400 if you

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.389 
which runs from 100 to 6400 if you
increase<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.210> sensitivity<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:55.530> native<00:00:55.980> ISO

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
increase the sensitivity the native ISO

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.930 
increase the sensitivity the native ISO
range<00:00:56.670> runs<00:00:56.910> from<00:00:57.090> 100<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.870> 3200<00:00:58.820> also<00:00:59.820> the

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
range runs from 100 to 3200 also the

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.700 
range runs from 100 to 3200 also the
back<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.270> camera<00:01:00.480> there's<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:01.020> new<00:01:01.289> screen

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
back of the camera there's a new screen

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.340 
back of the camera there's a new screen
and<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.070> features<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.399> 921<00:01:03.359> KDOT<00:01:03.750> resolution

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
and it features a 921 KDOT resolution

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.350 
and it features a 921 KDOT resolution
again<00:01:05.010> this<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.400> an<00:01:05.489> improvement<00:01:05.760> on<00:01:06.299> its

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
again this is an improvement on its

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.020 
again this is an improvement on its
predecessor<00:01:07.580> just<00:01:08.580> like<00:01:08.729> we've<00:01:08.850> seen<00:01:08.880> on

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
up on is the cameras lack of raw support

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
now on first glance the teaser at 40 may

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.080 
now on first glance the teaser at 40 may
look<00:01:43.439> very<00:01:43.710> similar<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.280> its<00:01:44.399> predecessors

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
look very similar to its predecessors

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.670 
look very similar to its predecessors
but<00:01:45.420> actually<00:01:45.720> when<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:45.869> take<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.140> closer<00:01:46.530> look

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
but actually when you take a closer look

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.520 
but actually when you take a closer look
there<00:01:47.070> are<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.399> few<00:01:47.880> little<00:01:48.090> revisions<00:01:48.630> now<00:01:49.350> one

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
there are a few little revisions now one

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.870 
there are a few little revisions now one
of<00:01:49.560> these<00:01:49.770> is<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.070> hand<00:01:50.280> grip<00:01:50.430> on<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.640> side

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
of these is the hand grip on the side

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.850 
of these is the hand grip on the side
it's<00:01:51.149> an<00:01:51.240> autumn<00:01:51.479> rubberized<00:01:51.960> hand<00:01:52.290> grip<00:01:52.470> and

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
NFC now NFC stands for near field

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.360 
NFC now NFC stands for near field
communication<00:02:22.050> and<00:02:22.500> what<00:02:22.740> this<00:02:22.920> allows<00:02:23.190> you

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
communication and what this allows you

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.310 
communication and what this allows you
to<00:02:23.490> do<00:02:23.610> is<00:02:23.820> just<00:02:24.300> to<00:02:24.420> communicate<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.020> camera

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
to do is just to communicate the camera

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.080 
to do is just to communicate the camera
with<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.530> smart<00:02:25.890> device<00:02:26.070> such<00:02:26.490> as<00:02:26.520> a<00:02:26.670> smartphone

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
with a smart device such as a smartphone

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.720 
with a smart device such as a smartphone
that<00:02:27.450> is<00:02:27.510> NFC<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.290> labeled<00:02:28.680> so<00:02:29.400> how<00:02:29.490> does<00:02:29.640> it

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
that is NFC and labeled so how does it

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.730 
that is NFC and labeled so how does it
work<00:02:29.850> well<00:02:30.180> basically<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:31.140> just<00:02:31.170> touch<00:02:31.560> the

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
work well basically you just touch the

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.380 
work well basically you just touch the
two<00:02:31.890> devices<00:02:32.130> together<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:32.880> you<00:02:33.090> can<00:02:33.210> just

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
two devices together and you can just

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.030 
two devices together and you can just
transmit<00:02:33.810> your<00:02:33.930> images<00:02:34.290> from<00:02:34.500> one<00:02:34.680> device<00:02:34.980> to

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
transmit your images from one device to

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.520 
transmit your images from one device to
the<00:02:35.250> other<00:02:35.340> very<00:02:35.970> very<00:02:36.210> easily<00:02:36.450> just<00:02:36.840> meaning

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
the other very very easily just meaning

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.890 
the other very very easily just meaning
that<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:37.800> don't<00:02:37.830> need<00:02:38.070> any<00:02:38.220> cables<00:02:38.810> one<00:02:39.810> of

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
that you don't need any cables one of

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.150 
that you don't need any cables one of
the<00:02:39.960> main<00:02:40.110> requirements<00:02:40.260> a<00:02:40.830> travel

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
the main requirements a travel

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.250 
the main requirements a travel
photographer<00:02:41.580> needs<00:02:41.730> from<00:02:42.360> a<00:02:42.510> compact<00:02:42.990> such

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
photographer needs from a compact such

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.140 
photographer needs from a compact such
as<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:43.470> Teesside<00:02:43.770> 40<00:02:44.070> is<00:02:44.280> it<00:02:44.790> for<00:02:44.970> it<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.090> be

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
as the Teesside 40 is it for it to be

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.440 
as the Teesside 40 is it for it to be
small<00:02:45.660> and<00:02:45.950> durable<00:02:46.950> the<00:02:47.460> t<00:02:47.610> 740<00:02:48.030> does<00:02:48.180> both<00:02:48.420> of

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
small and durable the t 740 does both of

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.150 
small and durable the t 740 does both of
these<00:02:48.780> and<00:02:49.080> you<00:02:49.140> can<00:02:49.260> just<00:02:49.410> see<00:02:49.560> by<00:02:49.710> extending

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
these and you can just see by extending

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.830 
these and you can just see by extending
the<00:02:50.250> lens<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:50.670> then<00:02:51.060> just<00:02:51.240> by<00:02:51.330> contracting

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
the lens and then just by contracting

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.890 
the lens and then just by contracting
again<00:02:52.080> just<00:02:52.860> how<00:02:52.950> small<00:02:53.250> it<00:02:53.430> really<00:02:53.760> is<00:02:53.940> the

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
again just how small it really is the

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.960 
again just how small it really is the
performance<00:02:55.350> of<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.560> TZD<00:02:55.920> 40<00:02:56.220> is<00:02:56.400> very<00:02:56.730> good

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
performance of the TZD 40 is very good

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.910 
performance of the TZD 40 is very good
indeed<00:02:57.120> it<00:02:57.660> fires<00:02:57.930> up<00:02:58.110> very<00:02:58.410> very<00:02:58.620> quickly

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
indeed it fires up very very quickly

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.140 
indeed it fires up very very quickly
allowing<00:02:59.430> you<00:02:59.610> to<00:02:59.790> shoot<00:02:59.970> any
