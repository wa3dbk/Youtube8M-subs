car and there's also sensors inside
those<00:01:32.819> filters<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:34.050> will<00:01:34.289> sense<00:01:35.899> the<00:01:36.899> air

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
those filters that will sense the air

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.710 
those filters that will sense the air
and<00:01:37.380> say<00:01:38.340> you're<00:01:38.550> behind<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.910> diesel<00:01:39.270> truck<00:01:39.479> or

and say you're behind a diesel truck or
something<00:01:39.990> like<00:01:40.050> that<00:01:40.110> it'll<00:01:40.979> automatically

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
something like that it'll automatically

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.100 
something like that it'll automatically
switch<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.030> cabin<00:01:42.390> air<00:01:42.509> over<00:01:42.690> to<00:01:42.810> recirculate

switch the cabin air over to recirculate

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:50.359 
switch the cabin air over to recirculate
so<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.709> doesn't<00:01:44.039> draw<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.340> into<00:01:44.580> the<00:01:44.670> car<00:01:49.369> we'll

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
so it doesn't draw it into the car we'll

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.740 
so it doesn't draw it into the car we'll
take<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.550> look<00:01:50.789> at<00:01:50.880> on<00:01:50.940> the<00:01:51.030> passenger<00:01:51.509> side<00:01:51.690> of
