00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.790
 but the wheel of the story continues to turn we look into the future of 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.840
 Gardening a vertical indicated that the cue 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.850
 and we have a pioneer of this scene in California for her 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.219
 visited 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.399
 Who actually said that the cake must be offered 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.890
 Space for the green is everywhere at the end 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:25.599
 pay at the walls 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:30.489
 in the world capital of the ecological upheaval also Gerd Billen even the 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:34.840
 Car repair shops hang the nature of the green soul of many banks 

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:36.120
 per year 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.810
 the San Francisco 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:42.350
 In this huge city that concrete and asphalt is more and more urban 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.220
 green 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.620
 this is also due to Green Car in the forge - that Purtscher Kuhlmann 2 million 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.250
 who beautiful Forest Guard Ernst is the vision for this garden is worldwide 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.140
 to provide more people with systems by which they use their own names 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.670
 The site is sal, even if they have neither land nor enough water 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.759
 Data abuse brought the point how do we reach here two billion 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:09.400
 Humans on earth gave no water and no shelters but Haase the 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.310
 Eee Pad Inter then set the goal because especially for him personally 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.659
 so far you can do your development aid in Africa 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.320
 and because it's just grief that Rene planting keeps pests 

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:26.700
 why not fall into the vertical with a cycle of fall victim 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.700
 the water itself circulates constantly 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.110
 he became famous for having built a ship through the expedition with the Plastiki 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.590
 Trash with a round in the garden to drive over the Pacific 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.670
 the price of the counterclaim 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.140
 he himself is in the PlusCity garden is so exciting because he first time the 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.650
 Possibility to eat vegetables completely independently on the sea 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:52.550
 there 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.420
 1240 fresh vegetables or fruits in the middle of the sea. Attachments for 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.770
 especially interesting for cruise ships or ferries in the ear 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.670
 of strength and he proves 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.799
 with the little what should the entire crew on a 18 by 8 meters large 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.269
 Boat from the beginning of the concert 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.949
 a perfect model for 3 2 billion people on earth who just over 

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:15.029
 a few liters of water per capita in the lead before Norbert Kleyboldt 

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:16.289
 discuss it 

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:18.439
 Picture AVO Ramsauer 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:23.620
 This system uses water with a wind turbine or, alternatively, a solar cell 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.689
 Lena squirmed from below 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:28.869
 it flows down through the vertical garden again 

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:31.589
 and collects in an aquarium at the foot 

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:34.589
 the cycle is closed 

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:39.969
 it is the strongest winner of this what we do relax in the garden 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:43.549
 simply because he's like an eardrum cocked on a frame of applicants 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:44.309
 blackens 

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:47.999
 al the subject matter with Thales and the plants grow on a fleece that 

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:50.969
 less than two inches thick is in bed 

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:54.989
 Server these plants are only a week old and that's easy 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.989
 who remove the earth from the roots of the seedlings feel it and then 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.569
 they were used in this notch here 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:05.269
 SSL we put them in Vienna a kind of envelope 7 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:06.649
 That's how it looks 

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:08.379
 should be sideways 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:12.590
 this is IT because of the war, whether it's sacrificing this organic wall hanging we use 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.720
 For example, around fences and buildings around schools 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:19.599
 Last season, you'll quickly find a garden without a bite 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:23.349
 or gilding room yes it looks very nice in Bavaria 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:24.499
 around this 

00:03:24.499 --> 00:03:25.650
 he is here before 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.000
 Warren Buffett is it's a school project now are the pumps with 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.240
 solar or wind powered Celle will be the whole then too 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:37.400
 Educationally used to control everything from a weather station to the controlled 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.400
 among other things the humidity and culture conditions would have 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.590
 Ellis price for a barrel Isa if necessary then the solar cells or the 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.239
 Wind turbine activated so the bottom line generates this pretty plants 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.659
 Now on a small area a lot of energy is reserved here now 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:58.420
 By the way, on the back makes a heavy rubber mat all waterproof Val 

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:01.590
 d'isere and this is it is the consumer variant of the little vampire 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.649
 so Morgan 

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:07.039
 The frame is made of hard plastic in a steep descent 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:12.289
 several layers of FIS allow the plants to become sufficiently rooted 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:18.079
 VAT that they only have one plant 

00:04:19.059 --> 00:04:22.059
 a practical matter for every household 

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:25.409
 Rositzki Champs around 

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:28.990
 most of the herbs are parsley mint just about everything you can 

00:04:28.989 --> 00:04:30.449
 in the kitchen garden course 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:33.199
 "There are still hopes for leaves, but Alonso is a giant for a long time. 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:36.199
 Tischkicker Woeser 1 Euro to be heard 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.720
 against Carinthia for everyone 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.230
 is currently used as a professor in the classroom for prospective teachers 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.770
 so he coined the new American garden pedagogy 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.400
 Yesterday Koller was only to meet ham and politicians from Haiti 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.550
 The former earthquake area will be the site of his next vertical gardens 

00:04:57.309 --> 00:05:01.969
 after that, the world's smallest fan in Marten settlements will join him 

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:04.410
 Margit Grohmann 2 Mio 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:05.189
 is one 

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:07.610
 these revisions lie 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.409
 essential part of a 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:12.339
 she wants what does not let me sleep if he is the next 

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:14.979
 Generations leave a world worth living for 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:19.229
 I'm looking for new ideas angry farmers at a few 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:21.759
 interesting construction existence instead
