actually quite fun coming up with the

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.199 
actually quite fun coming up with the
concept<00:01:58.679> we<00:01:59.340> kind<00:01:59.549> of<00:01:59.640> designed<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.000> bag

00:02:00.199 --> 00:02:00.209 
concept we kind of designed the bag

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:02.359 
concept we kind of designed the bag
based<00:02:00.600> on<00:02:00.780> what<00:02:01.020> would<00:02:01.200> be<00:02:01.380> inside<00:02:02.069> of<00:02:02.130> that

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
based on what would be inside of that

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.279 
based on what would be inside of that
person's<00:02:02.729> bag<00:02:02.940> essentially<00:02:03.750> made<00:02:03.929> it<00:02:04.049> like<00:02:04.200> an

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
person's bag essentially made it like an

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:06.910 
person's bag essentially made it like an
x-ray

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.499 

there's<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:08.009> sense<00:02:08.250> of<00:02:08.490> being<00:02:08.729> quite<00:02:09.030> moved<00:02:09.300> by

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
there's a sense of being quite moved by

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.390 
there's a sense of being quite moved by
being<00:02:10.170> here<00:02:10.350> and<00:02:10.530> showing<00:02:10.740> a<00:02:10.860> collection<00:02:11.250> but

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
being here and showing a collection but

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.250 
being here and showing a collection but
I<00:02:11.490> think<00:02:11.700> won't<00:02:12.360> anything<00:02:12.600> it<00:02:12.840> makes<00:02:12.990> you<00:02:13.110> feel

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
I think won't anything it makes you feel

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.309 
I think won't anything it makes you feel
like<00:02:13.410> you<00:02:13.530> need<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:13.770> strive<00:02:14.040> so<00:02:14.310> much<00:02:14.490> harder

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
like you need to strive so much harder

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.170 
like you need to strive so much harder
every<00:02:16.319> time<00:02:16.560> I<00:02:16.739> go<00:02:16.890> away<00:02:17.010> it<00:02:17.430> inspires<00:02:17.850> me

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
every time I go away it inspires me

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.699 
every time I go away it inspires me
especially<00:02:18.690> when<00:02:18.810> you<00:02:18.930> allow<00:02:19.170> yourself<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.590> be

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
especially when you allow yourself to be

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.559
