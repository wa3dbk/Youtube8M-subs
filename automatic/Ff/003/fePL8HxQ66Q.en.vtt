you<00:00:19.140> I<00:00:19.500> see<00:00:20.339> how<00:00:20.460> thick<00:00:20.730> that<00:00:20.759> lettuce<00:00:21.269> I<00:00:22.310> think

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
you I see how thick that lettuce I think

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.210 
you I see how thick that lettuce I think
it<00:00:23.609> was<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.820> waste<00:00:24.179> an<00:00:24.359> entire<00:00:26.960> city<00:00:27.960> saying<00:00:28.349> we
