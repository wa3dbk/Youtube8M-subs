and a lot of people don't really even

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.370 
and a lot of people don't really even
know<00:01:24.220> about<00:01:24.460> them<00:01:24.730> in<00:01:24.940> fact<00:01:25.540> every<00:01:25.930> time<00:01:26.170> they

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
know about them in fact every time they

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.770

of war figures like Bogner now since
this<00:02:34.930> is<00:02:35.170> a<00:02:35.620> low<00:02:36.310> production<00:02:36.819> figure<00:02:37.269> that<00:02:37.450> is

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
this is a low production figure that is

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.649 
this is a low production figure that is
all<00:02:37.810> hand<00:02:38.260> cast<00:02:38.620> and<00:02:39.010> hand-painted<00:02:40.000> these<00:02:40.510> are

all hand cast and hand-painted these are

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:42.000 
all hand cast and hand-painted these are
definitely<00:02:41.049> going<00:02:41.319> to<00:02:41.409> be<00:02:41.500> priced

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
definitely going to be priced

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.890

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
accordingly so they are going to be a

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.179 
accordingly so they are going to be a
little<00:02:44.109> more<00:02:44.260> expensive<00:02:44.590> than<00:02:44.769> your<00:02:44.980> average

action<00:02:46.120> figure<00:02:46.450> these<00:02:46.870> are<00:02:47.049> certainly<00:02:47.409> more

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
action figure these are certainly more

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.869 
action figure these are certainly more

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 
meant for display and they're definitely

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:51.110 
meant for display and they're definitely
not<00:02:49.209> for<00:02:49.420> everybody<00:02:49.629> but<00:02:49.959> I'll<00:02:50.409> tell<00:02:50.620> you<00:02:50.769> this

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
this would actually probably run cheaper

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.119 
this would actually probably run cheaper
