plot by the sword the sword I like the

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.190 
plot by the sword the sword I like the
idea<00:02:55.940> that<00:02:56.240> again<00:02:56.660> the<00:02:56.990> sword<00:02:57.290> can<00:02:57.710> reach<00:02:58.610> out

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
idea that again the sword can reach out

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.910 
idea that again the sword can reach out
further<00:03:00.700> even<00:03:01.700> when<00:03:01.820> you<00:03:01.850> do<00:03:02.410> like<00:03:03.410> with<00:03:03.650> the

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
further even when you do like with the

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.680 
further even when you do like with the
Trident<00:03:04.490> kind<00:03:04.730> of<00:03:04.820> thing<00:03:05.060> going<00:03:05.390> with<00:03:05.540> the

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
Trident kind of thing going with the

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.740 
Trident kind of thing going with the
sword<00:03:05.980> sort<00:03:06.980> flips<00:03:07.550> out<00:03:08.500> supposedly<00:03:09.610> giggle

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
sword sort flips out supposedly giggle

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.690 
sword sort flips out supposedly giggle
and<00:03:11.750> like<00:03:12.200> that's<00:03:12.320> cooking<00:03:12.890> you<00:03:12.980> off<00:03:13.160> to<00:03:13.460> and

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
and like that's cooking you off to and

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.580 
and like that's cooking you off to and
again<00:03:14.060> like<00:03:14.300> I<00:03:14.420> said<00:03:14.450> it<00:03:14.780> has<00:03:14.960> a<00:03:14.990> try<00:03:15.380> and

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
again like I said it has a try and

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.240 
again like I said it has a try and
effect<00:03:15.920> yeah<00:03:16.540> now<00:03:17.540> based<00:03:18.140> on<00:03:18.350> how<00:03:18.530> I<00:03:18.830> have

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
effect yeah now based on how I have

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.580 
effect yeah now based on how I have
imposed<00:03:19.580> here<00:03:20.060> obviously<00:03:20.720> the<00:03:21.110> sword<00:03:21.380> is<00:03:21.560> a

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
imposed here obviously the sword is a

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.410 
imposed here obviously the sword is a
little<00:03:21.860> heavy<00:03:22.070> because<00:03:22.610> I<00:03:22.850> originally<00:03:23.120> had

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
little heavy because I originally had

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.100 
little heavy because I originally had
imposed<00:03:23.930> with<00:03:24.830> the<00:03:24.950> sword<00:03:25.220> behind<00:03:26.180> him<00:03:26.450> based

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
imposed with the sword behind him based

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.260 
imposed with the sword behind him based
on<00:03:27.320> the<00:03:27.470> fact<00:03:27.710> that<00:03:27.830> he<00:03:28.160> has<00:03:28.550> a<00:03:28.580> limited<00:03:29.000> pose
