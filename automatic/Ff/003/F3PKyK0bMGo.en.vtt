00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
or end so when you look at the drawing

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.800 
or end so when you look at the drawing

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
itself it has kind of a a resonating

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.900 
itself it has kind of a a resonating
quality<00:01:59.319> because<00:01:59.649> it's<00:01:59.950> a<00:02:00.190> line<00:02:00.429> drawing<00:02:00.729> you

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
quality because it's a line drawing you

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.400

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
starting point that could potentially

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.180 
starting point that could potentially
raise<00:02:21.420> $25,000<00:02:22.420> for<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:22.959> fund<00:02:23.230> it's
