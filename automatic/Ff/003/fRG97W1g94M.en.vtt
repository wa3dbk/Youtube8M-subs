00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.300 
to clip onto the side but I recommend
is<00:01:52.749> getting<00:01:52.960> a<00:01:53.079> nice<00:01:53.229> digital<00:01:53.649> thermometer

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
is getting a nice digital thermometer

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.550 
is getting a nice digital thermometer
very<00:01:54.700> cheap<00:01:55.030> and<00:01:55.060> inexpensive<00:01:55.299> and<00:01:56.079> one<00:01:56.380> thing

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
very cheap and inexpensive and one thing

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.200 
very cheap and inexpensive and one thing
I<00:01:56.619> like<00:01:56.799> about<00:01:56.829> it<00:01:57.130> is<00:01:57.549> that<00:01:57.700> you<00:01:57.909> can<00:01:58.030> set<00:01:58.179> a

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
I like about it is that you can set a

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.120 
I like about it is that you can set a
timer<00:01:58.509> so<00:01:58.840> when<00:01:59.170> it's<00:01:59.469> a<00:01:59.560> certain<00:01:59.859> temperature

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
timer so when it's a certain temperature

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.069 
timer so when it's a certain temperature
an<00:02:00.670> alarm<00:02:01.000> go<00:02:01.119> off<00:02:01.149> allowing<00:02:01.569> me<00:02:01.719> to<00:02:01.869> do<00:02:01.960> other

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:03.959 
an alarm go off allowing me to do other
things<00:02:02.140> in<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:02.439> kitchen<00:02:02.560> so<00:02:03.340> it's<00:02:03.579> beautiful

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:03.969 
things in the kitchen so it's beautiful

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:05.990
