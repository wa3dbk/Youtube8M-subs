00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.710 
and the next the galaxy s2 is still
trying<00:02:27.320> to<00:02:27.560> load<00:02:27.740> it<00:02:27.860> up<00:02:28.010> and<00:02:28.430> it's<00:02:29.420> done<00:02:29.600> as

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
trying to load it up and it's done as

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.600 
trying to load it up and it's done as
well<00:02:29.900> so<00:02:30.470> it's<00:02:30.590> just<00:02:30.770> a<00:02:30.830> couple<00:02:31.040> of<00:02:31.220> seconds

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
well so it's just a couple of seconds

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.570 
well so it's just a couple of seconds
slower<00:02:31.880> not<00:02:32.840> that<00:02:33.200> much<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:34.190> nexus

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
slower not that much the nexus

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.740 
slower not that much the nexus
definitely<00:02:34.970> be<00:02:35.060> again<00:02:35.540> so<00:02:36.170> that's<00:02:36.290> two<00:02:36.560> points

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
definitely be again so that's two points

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.510 
definitely be again so that's two points
let's<00:02:38.750> try<00:02:38.930> another<00:02:39.080> one<00:02:39.350> this<00:02:40.070> time<00:02:40.340> we'll

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
let's try another one this time we'll

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:51.880 
let's try another one this time we'll
try<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:40.730> BBC<00:02:41.209> website

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.820 

so<00:02:52.890> it<00:02:52.950> looks<00:02:53.010> like<00:02:53.570> the<00:02:54.570> Nexus<00:02:55.380> done<00:02:55.650> that

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
so it looks like the Nexus done that

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.310 
so it looks like the Nexus done that
before<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.340> galaxy<00:02:56.550> s2<00:02:56.820> it<00:02:57.510> was<00:02:57.630> really<00:02:58.080> fast

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
before the galaxy s2 it was really fast

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.830 
before the galaxy s2 it was really fast
on<00:02:58.500> that<00:02:58.560> website<00:02:58.830> mind<00:02:59.730> you<00:03:00.000> try<00:03:00.750> and

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
on that website mind you try and

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.740 
on that website mind you try and
remember<00:03:01.080> that<00:03:02.070> ICS<00:03:02.460> doesn't<00:03:03.000> support<00:03:03.390> flash

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
remember that ICS doesn't support flash

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.070 
remember that ICS doesn't support flash
at<00:03:04.320> the<00:03:04.380> moment<00:03:04.740> so<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:06.120> galaxy<00:03:06.480> s2<00:03:06.630> is<00:03:06.930> got

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
at the moment so the galaxy s2 is got

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.370 
at the moment so the galaxy s2 is got
flash<00:03:07.320> enabled<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:08.750> Nexus<00:03:09.750> doesn't<00:03:10.260> have

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
flash enabled and Nexus doesn't have

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.450 
flash enabled and Nexus doesn't have
flash<00:03:10.650> enabled<00:03:10.890> obviously<00:03:12.320> so<00:03:13.320> with<00:03:14.190> that<00:03:14.310> in

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
flash enabled obviously so with that in

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.880 
flash enabled obviously so with that in
mind<00:03:14.490> the<00:03:15.270> galaxy<00:03:15.690> s2<00:03:16.140> is<00:03:16.380> just<00:03:16.620> slightly

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
mind the galaxy s2 is just slightly

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
mind the galaxy s2 is just slightly
slower<00:03:17.430> maybe<00:03:18.200> when<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.290> next<00:03:19.470> gets<00:03:20.010> flash<00:03:20.610> it

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
slower maybe when the next gets flash it

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.040 
slower maybe when the next gets flash it
might<00:03:21.060> slow<00:03:21.210> down<00:03:21.300> a<00:03:21.480> bit<00:03:21.600> because<00:03:21.810> it's<00:03:21.960> gonna

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
might slow down a bit because it's gonna

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.170 
might slow down a bit because it's gonna
have<00:03:22.200> more<00:03:22.380> to<00:03:22.560> load<00:03:22.770> up<00:03:22.980> but<00:03:23.850> for<00:03:24.000> a<00:03:24.030> moment

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
have more to load up but for a moment

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.320 
have more to load up but for a moment
the<00:03:24.750> Nexus<00:03:25.200> is<00:03:25.500> definitely<00:03:26.130> necessary<00:03:26.460> it's

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
the Nexus is definitely necessary it's

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.110 
the Nexus is definitely necessary it's
definitely<00:03:27.870> one<00:03:28.500> or<00:03:28.620> two<00:03:28.740> seconds<00:03:29.190> faster<00:03:29.340> but

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
definitely one or two seconds faster but

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.180 
definitely one or two seconds faster but
let's<00:03:30.270> see<00:03:30.390> how<00:03:30.570> it<00:03:30.600> does<00:03:30.780> with<00:03:31.380> zooming<00:03:31.950> and

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
let's see how it does with zooming and

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.400 
let's see how it does with zooming and
you<00:03:32.340> know<00:03:32.460> actually<00:03:33.210> scrolling<00:03:34.080> around<00:03:34.170> the

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
you know actually scrolling around the

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:41.510 
you know actually scrolling around the
website<00:03:36.770> that's<00:03:37.770> not<00:03:37.950> too<00:03:38.100> bad<00:03:39.950> the<00:03:40.950> galaxy<00:03:41.400> s2

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
website that's not too bad the galaxy s2

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.820 
website that's not too bad the galaxy s2
has<00:03:41.820> that<00:03:42.030> bounce<00:03:42.690> to<00:03:43.020> it<00:03:43.050> when<00:03:43.380> you<00:03:43.470> go<00:03:43.620> right

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
has that bounce to it when you go right

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.920 
has that bounce to it when you go right
to<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.040> bottom<00:03:44.220> so<00:03:44.550> it<00:03:44.580> does<00:03:44.850> feel<00:03:45.630> a<00:03:45.870> bit

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
to the bottom so it does feel a bit

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.480 
to the bottom so it does feel a bit
smoother<00:03:46.830> but<00:03:47.340> a<00:03:47.400> nexus<00:03:47.940> is<00:03:48.900> also<00:03:49.620> smooth<00:03:49.950> it

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
smoother but a nexus is also smooth it

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.040 
smoother but a nexus is also smooth it
just<00:03:50.670> doesn't<00:03:50.820> feel<00:03:51.060> as<00:03:51.300> smooth<00:03:51.630> by<00:03:51.900> it's

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
just doesn't feel as smooth by it's

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.690 
just doesn't feel as smooth by it's
definitely<00:03:52.440> smooth<00:03:52.710> it's<00:03:53.340> because<00:03:53.610> it

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
definitely smooth it's because it

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.820 
definitely smooth it's because it
doesn't<00:03:53.910> have<00:03:53.970> that<00:03:54.060> bounce<00:03:54.420> effect<00:03:54.830> now

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
doesn't have that bounce effect now

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.540 
doesn't have that bounce effect now
we'll<00:03:55.980> try<00:03:56.160> a<00:03:56.190> double<00:03:56.580> tap<00:03:58.220> are<00:03:59.220> they<00:03:59.370> gay

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
we'll try a double tap are they gay

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.949 
we'll try a double tap are they gay
straight<00:04:00.090> on<00:04:00.209> that<00:04:00.330> one<00:04:02.540> looks<00:04:03.540> like<00:04:03.720> there<00:04:03.930> is

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
straight on that one looks like there is

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.710 
straight on that one looks like there is
to<00:04:04.230> perform<00:04:04.590> slightly<00:04:05.070> bitter<00:04:05.220> dear<00:04:05.489> um<00:04:05.720> it

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
to perform slightly bitter dear um it

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.750 
to perform slightly bitter dear um it
just<00:04:06.780> wrapped<00:04:07.770> the<00:04:07.920> text<00:04:08.370> and<00:04:08.459> everything

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
just wrapped the text and everything

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.210 
just wrapped the text and everything
around<00:04:08.880> properly<00:04:09.390> well<00:04:10.020> as<00:04:10.290> you<00:04:10.739> can<00:04:10.830> see<00:04:10.890> you

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
around properly well as you can see you

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.320 
around properly well as you can see you
layer<00:04:11.400> mixes<00:04:12.239> things<00:04:13.200> are<00:04:13.670> hiding<00:04:14.670> a<00:04:14.910> bit<00:04:15.209> to

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
layer mixes things are hiding a bit to

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:21.770 
layer mixes things are hiding a bit to
the<00:04:15.420> left<00:04:15.919> let's<00:04:16.919> zoom<00:04:17.070> out<00:04:17.190> again<00:04:20.060> okay<00:04:21.060> one

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
the left let's zoom out again okay one

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.290 
the left let's zoom out again okay one
and<00:04:22.160> this<00:04:23.160> time<00:04:23.370> we'll<00:04:23.550> try<00:04:23.730> a<00:04:23.760> pinch<00:04:24.120> to<00:04:24.390> zoom

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
and this time we'll try a pinch to zoom

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.839 
and this time we'll try a pinch to zoom
very<00:04:27.300> smooth

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:31.849 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:35.439 

okay<00:04:32.629> it's<00:04:33.199> acting<00:04:33.709> a<00:04:33.770> bit<00:04:33.800> at<00:04:34.069> this<00:04:34.279> time<00:04:34.490> it's

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:35.449 
okay it's acting a bit at this time it's

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:39.129 
okay it's acting a bit at this time it's
still<00:04:35.629> smooth<00:04:35.929> but<00:04:36.619> I<00:04:36.999> can<00:04:37.999> still<00:04:38.300> sense<00:04:38.719> a<00:04:38.929> bit

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
still smooth but I can still sense a bit

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:42.909 
still smooth but I can still sense a bit
of<00:04:39.289> lag<00:04:39.770> there<00:04:40.219> I<00:04:40.490> mean<00:04:41.389> it's<00:04:41.539> not<00:04:41.689> bad<00:04:41.929> let's

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
of lag there I mean it's not bad let's

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:47.079 
of lag there I mean it's not bad let's
give<00:04:43.099> the<00:04:43.279> galaxy<00:04:43.999> s2<00:04:44.119> a<00:04:44.300> try<00:04:46.089> that's

00:04:47.079 --> 00:04:47.089 
give the galaxy s2 a try that's

00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:49.499 
give the galaxy s2 a try that's
definitely<00:04:47.330> smooth<00:04:47.779> I<00:04:48.050> mean<00:04:48.529> it's<00:04:48.649> just

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:49.509 
definitely smooth I mean it's just

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:52.839 
definitely smooth I mean it's just
zooming<00:04:50.509> in<00:04:50.629> and<00:04:50.749> out<00:04:50.839> like<00:04:51.139> that<00:04:51.669> so<00:04:52.669> the<00:04:52.819> next

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:52.849 
zooming in and out like that so the next

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:55.689 
zooming in and out like that so the next
this<00:04:53.209> is<00:04:53.270> slightly<00:04:53.689> slower<00:04:54.319> in<00:04:54.679> zooming<00:04:55.580> in

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:55.699 
this is slightly slower in zooming in

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:58.540 
this is slightly slower in zooming in
when<00:04:55.849> you<00:04:55.939> do<00:04:56.029> pinching<00:04:57.249> but<00:04:58.249> it's<00:04:58.399> definitely

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
when you do pinching but it's definitely
