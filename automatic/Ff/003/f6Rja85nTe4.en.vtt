00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:58.110 
stretch I don't believe it's damaging my
hair<00:03:54.020> I<00:03:54.530> actually<00:03:55.460> seen<00:03:55.640> a<00:03:55.670> lot<00:03:56.000> of<00:03:56.030> positive

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
hair I actually seen a lot of positive

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.790 
hair I actually seen a lot of positive
results<00:03:59.120> with<00:03:59.870> my<00:04:00.050> hair<00:04:00.290> since<00:04:00.560> I've<00:04:00.680> been

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:00.800 
results with my hair since I've been

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.290 
results with my hair since I've been
doing<00:04:00.980> this<00:04:01.070> stretch<00:04:01.340> the<00:04:01.700> thickness<00:04:02.120> of<00:04:02.240> my

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
doing this stretch the thickness of my

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.170 
doing this stretch the thickness of my
hair<00:04:02.660> is<00:04:02.990> more<00:04:03.500> manageable<00:04:03.830> like<00:04:04.580> I<00:04:04.850> can

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
hair is more manageable like I can

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.420 
hair is more manageable like I can
pretty<00:04:06.110> much<00:04:06.200> do<00:04:06.470> anything<00:04:06.500> that<00:04:07.100> I<00:04:07.130> could

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
pretty much do anything that I could

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.340 
pretty much do anything that I could
when<00:04:07.670> I<00:04:07.730> was<00:04:07.880> relaxing<00:04:08.390> on<00:04:08.510> a<00:04:08.540> regular<00:04:08.870> basis

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
when I was relaxing on a regular basis

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.440 
when I was relaxing on a regular basis
so<00:04:09.410> I<00:04:09.860> really<00:04:10.340> had<00:04:10.490> a<00:04:10.520> pretty<00:04:10.790> much<00:04:11.000> negative

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
so I really had a pretty much negative

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.449 
so I really had a pretty much negative
impact<00:04:11.840> to<00:04:12.020> my<00:04:12.140> hair<00:04:12.350> since<00:04:13.190> I've<00:04:13.310> been

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
impact to my hair since I've been

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:16.599 
impact to my hair since I've been
