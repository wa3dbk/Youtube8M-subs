we have to make a weapon that allows us
to<00:01:31.240> do<00:01:31.420> the<00:01:31.630> whole<00:01:31.840> procedure<00:01:32.229> but<00:01:32.650> from<00:01:32.890> far

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
to do the whole procedure but from far

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.630 
to do the whole procedure but from far
away<00:01:33.310> and<00:01:33.670> a<00:01:33.940> moving<00:01:34.299> target<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:35.560> I<00:01:35.859> present<00:01:36.369> to

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
away and a moving target so I present to

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.440 
away and a moving target so I present to
you<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:38.439> Portobello<00:01:38.950> witch<00:01:39.299> incinerator<00:01:42.450> it

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
you the Portobello witch incinerator it

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.260 
you the Portobello witch incinerator it
does<00:01:43.659> three<00:01:43.990> things<00:01:44.020> it<00:01:44.619> douses<00:01:45.609> the<00:01:45.640> witch<00:01:46.000> in

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
does three things it douses the witch in

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.899 
does three things it douses the witch in
gasoline<00:01:46.740> second<00:01:47.740> trigger<00:01:47.950> would<00:01:48.369> set<00:01:48.700> the

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
gasoline second trigger would set the

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:50.969 
gasoline second trigger would set the
burning<00:01:49.299> arrow<00:01:49.479> on<00:01:49.810> fire<00:01:50.109> and<00:01:50.350> the<00:01:50.710> third

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
burning arrow on fire and the third

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.219 
burning arrow on fire and the third
trigger<00:01:51.340> will<00:01:51.850> launch<00:01:52.119> that<00:01:52.270> arrow<00:01:52.659> towards

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
trigger will launch that arrow towards

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.240 
trigger will launch that arrow towards
the<00:01:53.380> witch<00:01:53.530> and<00:01:53.829> burn<00:01:54.250> her<00:01:55.679> don't<00:01:56.679> do<00:01:56.859> this<00:01:57.039> at

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
the witch and burn her don't do this at

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.760 
the witch and burn her don't do this at
home

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.680 

so<00:02:04.770> this<00:02:05.010> is<00:02:05.160> how<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.460> works<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:06.000> put<00:02:06.570> the

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
so this is how it works you put the

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.530 
so this is how it works you put the
nozzle<00:02:06.930> into<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.530> gasoline<00:02:08.180> pull<00:02:09.180> back<00:02:09.390> the

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:09.540 
nozzle into the gasoline pull back the

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.460 
nozzle into the gasoline pull back the
plunger<00:02:10.670> lifts<00:02:11.670> up<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.090> weapon<00:02:12.420> put<00:02:13.320> the

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
plunger lifts up the weapon put the

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.210 
plunger lifts up the weapon put the
rubber<00:02:13.650> on<00:02:13.890> it

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
rubber on it

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.240 
rubber on it
fire<00:02:14.640> and<00:02:14.970> it<00:02:15.420> squirts<00:02:15.720> out<00:02:15.900> so<00:02:16.440> we<00:02:16.770> will<00:02:17.070> have

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
fire and it squirts out so we will have

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.920 
fire and it squirts out so we will have
a<00:02:17.310> soaking<00:02:18.060> wet<00:02:18.860> which<00:02:19.860> covered<00:02:20.430> in<00:02:20.580> gasoline

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
a soaking wet which covered in gasoline

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:27.830 
a soaking wet which covered in gasoline
okay<00:02:21.930> so<00:02:21.990> let's<00:02:22.380> see<00:02:22.560> how<00:02:22.680> it<00:02:22.830> sprays<00:02:26.810> okay<00:02:27.810> I

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
okay so let's see how it sprays okay I

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.450 
okay so let's see how it sprays okay I
think<00:02:27.990> that<00:02:28.260> was<00:02:28.410> perfect<00:02:28.830> it<00:02:29.100> was<00:02:29.160> slow

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
think that was perfect it was slow

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.010 
think that was perfect it was slow
enough<00:02:29.730> so<00:02:29.970> that<00:02:30.000> here<00:02:30.330> you<00:02:30.390> can<00:02:30.570> really<00:02:30.810> aim

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
enough so that here you can really aim

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.230 
enough so that here you can really aim
and<00:02:31.260> follow<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.650> witch<00:02:31.830> but<00:02:32.640> quick<00:02:32.940> enough<00:02:33.210> to

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
and follow the witch but quick enough to

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.270 
and follow the witch but quick enough to
soak<00:02:33.600> her<00:02:33.780> within<00:02:34.020> a<00:02:34.170> fraction<00:02:34.350> of<00:02:34.650> a<00:02:34.740> second<00:02:35.130> I

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
soak her within a fraction of a second I

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.400 
soak her within a fraction of a second I
think<00:02:36.120> it's<00:02:36.270> time<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.570> test<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.080> burning

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
think it's time to test the burning

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.580 
think it's time to test the burning
arrow<00:02:37.560> if<00:02:38.310> I<00:02:38.400> pull<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.850> trigger<00:02:38.880> here<00:02:39.590> there

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
arrow if I pull the trigger here there

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.250 
arrow if I pull the trigger here there
this<00:02:41.130> level<00:02:41.520> presses<00:02:41.850> on<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:42.030> plunger<00:02:42.300> of<00:02:42.600> the

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
this level presses on the plunger of the

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.000 
this level presses on the plunger of the
lighter<00:02:43.820> setting<00:02:44.820> the<00:02:45.030> arrow<00:02:45.440> on<00:02:46.440> fire

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.360 

now<00:02:50.010> I<00:02:50.040> think<00:02:50.220> it's<00:02:50.550> time<00:02:50.610> to<00:02:50.970> shoot<00:02:52.370> then

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
now I think it's time to shoot then

00:02:53.370 --> 00:03:04.619 
now I think it's time to shoot then
let's<00:02:53.580> fire<00:02:54.080> oops<00:02:58.640> we<00:02:59.640> find<00:02:59.910> the<00:03:00.000> arrow

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:04.629 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.770 

he's<00:03:05.409> still<00:03:05.680> burning

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.470 

okay<00:03:09.780> I<00:03:09.810> get<00:03:10.110> a<00:03:10.140> little<00:03:10.320> bit<00:03:10.470> closer<00:03:10.710> this<00:03:10.950> time

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
spread it like you would spread butter

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.400 
spread it like you would spread butter
on<00:03:55.380> a<00:03:55.560> sandwich<00:03:56.630> make<00:03:57.630> sure<00:03:57.780> to<00:03:57.990> work<00:03:58.170> the

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
on a sandwich make sure to work the

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.430 
on a sandwich make sure to work the
sulfur<00:03:58.860> nicely<00:03:59.790> into<00:04:00.120> the<00:04:00.300> TiVo<00:04:02.330> okay<00:04:03.330> and<00:04:03.900> we

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
sulfur nicely into the TiVo okay and we

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.850 
sulfur nicely into the TiVo okay and we
take<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:04.800> arrow<00:04:04.980> like<00:04:05.730> this<00:04:05.760> and<00:04:06.270> then<00:04:07.080> we

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
take the arrow like this and then we

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.370 
take the arrow like this and then we
roll<00:04:08.100> this<00:04:08.360> like<00:04:09.360> you<00:04:09.480> would<00:04:09.630> roll<00:04:09.810> a<00:04:09.870> cigar

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
roll this like you would roll a cigar

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.980 
roll this like you would roll a cigar
and<00:04:11.030> once<00:04:12.030> it's<00:04:12.240> done<00:04:12.600> we<00:04:12.930> take<00:04:13.709> the<00:04:14.040> wire<00:04:14.280> and

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:14.990 
and once it's done we take the wire and

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.820 
and once it's done we take the wire and
wrap<00:04:15.990> it<00:04:16.170> around<00:04:16.290> the<00:04:16.620> stable<00:04:17.040> not<00:04:17.940> too<00:04:18.120> dense

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
wrap it around the stable not too dense

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:24.530 
wrap it around the stable not too dense
just<00:04:19.830> so<00:04:20.040> it<00:04:20.190> holds<00:04:20.370> on<00:04:20.760> the<00:04:20.940> shaft<00:04:21.860> then<00:04:23.540> cut

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
just so it holds on the shaft then cut

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.200 
just so it holds on the shaft then cut
the<00:04:24.690> wire<00:04:25.160> and<00:04:26.160> we're<00:04:26.340> done<00:04:26.490> with<00:04:26.550> our<00:04:26.700> burning

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
the wire and we're done with our burning

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.590 
the wire and we're done with our burning
arrow<00:04:27.480> this<00:04:28.260> will<00:04:28.620> not<00:04:28.830> go<00:04:29.100> out<00:04:29.130> in<00:04:29.550> flight<00:04:29.820> the

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
arrow this will not go out in flight the

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.840 
arrow this will not go out in flight the
wind<00:04:30.870> will<00:04:31.170> make<00:04:31.650> it<00:04:31.800> really<00:04:32.130> hot<00:04:32.280> and<00:04:32.490> so

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
wind will make it really hot and so

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.810 
wind will make it really hot and so
sparks<00:04:33.420> will<00:04:33.630> fly<00:04:33.830> very<00:04:34.830> pretty<00:04:35.190> sight<00:04:35.520> at

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820

sparks will fly very pretty sight at
night<00:04:36.500> so<00:04:37.500> now<00:04:37.680> let's<00:04:37.920> see<00:04:38.130> it<00:04:38.220> in<00:04:38.310> action
