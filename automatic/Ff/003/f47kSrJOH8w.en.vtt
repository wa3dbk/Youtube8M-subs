00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.580 
when it doesn't kill them very
effectively<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.869> whole<00:01:52.079> point<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.439> this

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
effectively and the whole point of this

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.819 
effectively and the whole point of this
this<00:01:53.340> circle<00:01:54.299> is<00:01:54.479> is<00:01:54.810> when<00:01:55.110> they<00:01:55.200> enter<00:01:55.590> the

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
this circle is is when they enter the

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.639 
this circle is is when they enter the
circle<00:01:56.820> they're<00:01:57.299> supposed<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.659> die<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.170> they

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
circle they're supposed to die and they

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.830 
circle they're supposed to die and they
can<00:01:58.799> actually<00:01:59.009> run<00:01:59.700> through<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.090> because<00:02:00.390> it

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
can actually run through it because it

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.539 
can actually run through it because it
doesn't<00:02:01.140> kill<00:02:01.350> them<00:02:01.500> fast<00:02:01.740> enough<00:02:02.009> because<00:02:02.280> it

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
doesn't kill them fast enough because it

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.190 
doesn't kill them fast enough because it
just<00:02:02.640> doesn't<00:02:02.909> do<00:02:03.090> as<00:02:03.210> much<00:02:03.240> damage<00:02:03.390> anymore

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
just doesn't do as much damage anymore

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.490 
just doesn't do as much damage anymore
but<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.369> other<00:02:05.640> piece<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.149> equipment<00:02:06.780> is<00:02:06.990> the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
but the other piece of equipment is the

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.380 
but the other piece of equipment is the
distractions<00:02:08.340> room<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.759> distraction

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
distractions room and the distraction

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.410 
distractions room and the distraction
drone<00:02:09.629> is<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.890> exact<00:02:11.400> same<00:02:11.670> thing<00:02:12.030> as<00:02:12.209> the

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.240 
look out for those two pieces of

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.170 
look out for those two pieces of
equipment<00:03:35.540> I<00:03:35.870> recommend<00:03:36.740> getting<00:03:37.280> the<00:03:37.760> Nano

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
equipment I recommend getting the Nano

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.080 
equipment I recommend getting the Nano
swarm<00:03:38.330> early<00:03:39.110> on<00:03:39.140> I<00:03:39.350> have<00:03:39.620> to<00:03:39.800> say<00:03:40.010> I'd<00:03:40.700> rather

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
swarm early on I have to say I'd rather

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.750 
swarm early on I have to say I'd rather
use<00:03:41.480> the<00:03:41.660> Nano<00:03:41.930> swarm<00:03:42.050> early<00:03:43.010> in<00:03:43.130> the<00:03:43.250> game<00:03:43.459> and

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
use the Nano swarm early in the game and

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.790 
use the Nano swarm early in the game and
try<00:03:44.060> to<00:03:44.120> get<00:03:44.390> the<00:03:44.570> distraction<00:03:45.350> don't<00:03:45.530> out

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
try to get the distraction don't out

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.820 
try to get the distraction don't out
after<00:03:46.550> around<00:03:46.760> 22<00:03:47.300> just<00:03:47.959> because<00:03:48.410> the<00:03:48.590> Nano

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
after around 22 just because the Nano

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.490 
after around 22 just because the Nano
swarm<00:03:48.980> is<00:03:49.520> very<00:03:50.209> effective<00:03:50.660> in<00:03:50.990> the<00:03:51.140> early

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
swarm is very effective in the early

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.949 
swarm is very effective in the early
rounds<00:03:51.530> because<00:03:52.010> it<00:03:52.760> just<00:03:53.090> all<00:03:53.330> along<00:03:53.930> that

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
rounds because it just all along that

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:55.900 
rounds because it just all along that
spawn<00:03:54.440> in<00:03:54.560> a<00:03:54.650> run<00:03:54.860> towards<00:03:55.280> you<00:03:55.310> know<00:03:55.430> just<00:03:55.670> die

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
spawn in a run towards you know just die

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.140
