it's a very long the length of the
action<00:00:04.500> the<00:00:05.069> good<00:00:05.250> timing<00:00:05.819> is<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.180> priority

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
action the good timing is the priority

action the good timing is the priority
the<00:00:07.259> rotation<00:00:07.770> is<00:00:07.859> many<00:00:08.040> more<00:00:08.280> so<00:00:08.880> we're<00:00:09.030> going

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
the rotation is many more so we're going

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.180 
the rotation is many more so we're going
to<00:00:09.269> concentrate<00:00:09.800> primarily<00:00:10.800> on<00:00:11.099> space<00:00:13.190> let's

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
to concentrate primarily on space let's

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.640 
to concentrate primarily on space let's
show<00:00:14.519> it<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:14.670> you<00:00:17.750> so<00:00:18.750> I'm<00:00:18.869> very<00:00:19.050> where's<00:00:19.350> man
