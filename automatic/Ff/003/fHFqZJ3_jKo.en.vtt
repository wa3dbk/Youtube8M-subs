in this video we're going to look at
using<00:00:04.380> burnt<00:00:04.890> in<00:00:05.100> timecode<00:00:05.759> now<00:00:06.690> just<00:00:07.170> to<00:00:07.230> be

using burnt in timecode now just to be

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.230 
using burnt in timecode now just to be
clear<00:00:07.620> I'm<00:00:07.859> talking<00:00:07.890> about<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.580> eight<00:00:08.760> digit

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
clear I'm talking about the eight digit

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
burned into the video now why would you

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.269 
burned into the video now why would you
want<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.480> timecode<00:00:19.020> burnt<00:00:19.380> into<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.890> screen

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
want the timecode burnt into the screen

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.220 
want the timecode burnt into the screen
well<00:00:20.970> there<00:00:21.359> are<00:00:21.449> two<00:00:21.570> reasons<00:00:21.600> why<00:00:21.990> I<00:00:22.080> use

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
well there are two reasons why I use

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.890 
well there are two reasons why I use
Burton<00:00:22.859> timecode<00:00:23.310> firstly<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.539> might<00:00:24.720> want

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
Burton timecode firstly you might want

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.839 
Burton timecode firstly you might want
to<00:00:24.960> use<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.410> where<00:00:25.650> your<00:00:25.980> video<00:00:26.310> isn't<00:00:26.670> ready

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
to use it where your video isn't ready

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.490 
to use it where your video isn't ready
for<00:00:26.910> release<00:00:27.180> yet<00:00:27.660> so<00:00:27.990> if<00:00:28.080> you're<00:00:28.230> sending

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
for release yet so if you're sending

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.099 
for release yet so if you're sending
rough<00:00:28.859> cuts<00:00:29.189> with<00:00:29.490> burnt<00:00:29.730> in<00:00:29.910> timecode<00:00:30.480> just

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
rough cuts with burnt in timecode just

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.020 
rough cuts with burnt in timecode just
makes<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.439> very<00:00:31.590> clear<00:00:32.130> that<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.399> video<00:00:32.700> isn't

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
makes it very clear that the video isn't

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.389 
makes it very clear that the video isn't
ready<00:00:33.239> for<00:00:33.329> publishing<00:00:33.840> my<00:00:34.770> second<00:00:35.250> reason

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
ready for publishing my second reason

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.190 
ready for publishing my second reason
for<00:00:35.579> using<00:00:35.820> burning<00:00:36.390> timecode<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:37.020> for

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
for using burning timecode is for

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.869 
for using burning timecode is for
reference<00:00:37.380> on<00:00:37.800> rough<00:00:38.040> cuts<00:00:38.340> where<00:00:38.760> you

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
reference on rough cuts where you

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.459 
reference on rough cuts where you
haven't<00:00:39.149> got<00:00:39.270> your<00:00:39.300> client<00:00:39.840> sat<00:00:40.050> next<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.379> you

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
haven't got your client sat next to you

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.139 
haven't got your client sat next to you
during<00:00:40.739> editing<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.579> might<00:00:41.730> be<00:00:41.879> thinking

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
during editing you might be thinking

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.700 
during editing you might be thinking
that<00:00:42.180> most<00:00:42.390> media<00:00:42.809> players<00:00:43.020> have<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.230> runtime

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
that most media players have a runtime

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.010 
that most media players have a runtime
display<00:00:44.160> why<00:00:44.309> not<00:00:44.460> use<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:44.910> well<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:45.809> could

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
display why not use that well you could

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.600 
display why not use that well you could
but<00:00:46.260> I'll<00:00:46.350> give<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.620> two<00:00:46.800> quick<00:00:47.070> reasons<00:00:47.460> why

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
but I'll give you two quick reasons why

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.639 
but I'll give you two quick reasons why
you<00:00:47.670> shouldn't<00:00:48.170> firstly<00:00:49.170> it's<00:00:49.289> highly

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
you shouldn't firstly it's highly

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.500 
you shouldn't firstly it's highly
unlikely<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.489> person<00:00:50.670> watching<00:00:51.120> your

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
unlikely that the person watching your

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.540 
unlikely that the person watching your

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
wheat and a clock

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.880 
wheat and a clock
so<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.719> first<00:01:45.929> thing<00:01:46.079> I'm<00:01:46.170> going<00:01:46.289> to<00:01:46.350> do<00:01:46.500> is

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
so the first thing I'm going to do is

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.499 
so the first thing I'm going to do is
right-click<00:01:47.399> in<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:47.969> bin<00:01:48.179> here<00:01:48.509> go<00:01:49.289> new<00:01:49.560> item

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
right-click in the bin here go new item

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.539 
right-click in the bin here go new item
transparent<00:01:51.509> video<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:52.109> default<00:01:53.009> settings<00:01:53.429> are

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
transparent video a default settings are

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.270 
transparent video a default settings are
going<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.729> do<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.179> we<00:01:54.270> click<00:01:54.479> OK<00:01:54.869> then<00:01:55.740> we<00:01:55.920> drag

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
going to do so we click OK then we drag

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.969 
going to do so we click OK then we drag
the<00:01:57.000> transparent<00:01:57.659> video<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.409> top<00:01:58.679> layer

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
the transparent video to the top layer

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.950 
the transparent video to the top layer
in<00:01:59.250> our<00:01:59.369> sequence<00:01:59.789> so<00:02:00.270> that<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.479> timecode

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
in our sequence so that the timecode

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.559 
in our sequence so that the timecode
sits<00:02:01.319> on<00:02:01.469> top<00:02:01.649> of<00:02:01.799> everything<00:02:02.009> else<00:02:02.420> drag<00:02:03.420> it

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:03.569 
sits on top of everything else drag it

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:05.389 
sits on top of everything else drag it
out<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:03.990> duration<00:02:04.380> of<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.740> sequence<00:02:05.189> and

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
out to the duration of the sequence and

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.429 
out to the duration of the sequence and
as<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.119> would<00:02:06.209> expect<00:02:06.329> there's<00:02:06.990> no<00:02:07.110> change

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
as you would expect there's no change

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.160 
as you would expect there's no change
there<00:02:07.799> because<00:02:08.039> it's<00:02:08.190> transparent<00:02:08.429> video<00:02:09.170> we

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
there because it's transparent video we

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.720 
there because it's transparent video we
want<00:02:10.349> to<00:02:10.410> get<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.590> timecode<00:02:11.160> onto<00:02:11.640> this

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
want to get the timecode onto this

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.030 
want to get the timecode onto this
transparent<00:02:12.450> video<00:02:12.569> so<00:02:13.440> head<00:02:13.739> over<00:02:13.769> to

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
transparent video so head over to

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.140 
transparent video so head over to
effects<00:02:14.870> video<00:02:15.870> effects<00:02:16.760> video

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
effects video effects video

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.569 
effects video effects video
there's<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.989> timecode<00:02:19.530> so<00:02:20.160> we<00:02:20.310> drag<00:02:20.549> that

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:20.579 
there's the timecode so we drag that

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:22.940 
there's the timecode so we drag that
over<00:02:20.849> to<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.180> transparent<00:02:21.690> video<00:02:21.810> you<00:02:22.799> can

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
over to the transparent video you can

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.350 
over to the transparent video you can
see<00:02:23.190> it<00:02:23.400> appears<00:02:23.549> over<00:02:24.060> here

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
see it appears over here

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.060 
see it appears over here
so<00:02:26.020> now<00:02:26.140> we<00:02:26.200> want<00:02:26.410> to<00:02:26.470> go<00:02:26.530> to<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.770> effect

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
so now we want to go to the effect

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.750 
so now we want to go to the effect
controls<00:02:27.910> now<00:02:28.590> here's<00:02:29.590> timecode<00:02:30.220> settings

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
controls now here's timecode settings

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.340 
controls now here's timecode settings
you<00:02:31.420> can<00:02:31.540> see<00:02:31.720> we've<00:02:31.870> got<00:02:31.930> this<00:02:32.050> little

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
you can see we've got this little

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.080 
you can see we've got this little
indicator<00:02:32.620> here<00:02:33.070> that's<00:02:33.280> four<00:02:33.490> fields<00:02:33.940> and

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
indicator here that's four fields and

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.910 
indicator here that's four fields and
soon<00:02:34.330> as<00:02:34.510> our<00:02:34.660> timeline<00:02:35.110> is<00:02:35.140> progressive<00:02:35.770> we

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
soon as our timeline is progressive we

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.620 
soon as our timeline is progressive we
don't<00:02:36.130> need<00:02:36.310> that<00:02:36.520> so<00:02:36.820> I'm<00:02:36.910> going<00:02:37.090> to<00:02:37.120> turn<00:02:37.360> off

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
don't need that so I'm going to turn off

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.730 
don't need that so I'm going to turn off
the<00:02:38.080> field<00:02:38.350> symbol<00:02:38.800> and<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:40.660> next<00:02:40.900> thing<00:02:41.140> you

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
the field symbol and the next thing you

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.670 
the field symbol and the next thing you
see<00:02:41.950> that<00:02:42.130> there's<00:02:42.400> a<00:02:42.720> semi-transparent<00:02:43.720> box

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
see that there's a semi-transparent box

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.730 
see that there's a semi-transparent box
around<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.370> timecode<00:02:45.940> now<00:02:46.690> that<00:02:46.930> looks<00:02:47.170> ok<00:02:47.620> on

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
around the timecode now that looks ok on

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.440 
around the timecode now that looks ok on
that<00:02:47.890> clip<00:02:48.250> but<00:02:48.580> if<00:02:48.730> you<00:02:48.880> go<00:02:49.090> over<00:02:49.420> to

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
that clip but if you go over to

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.770 
that clip but if you go over to
something<00:02:49.960> that's<00:02:50.290> got<00:02:50.530> a<00:02:50.560> white<00:02:50.860> background

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
something that's got a white background

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.350 
something that's got a white background
it's<00:02:52.780> not<00:02:53.050> quite<00:02:53.590> as<00:02:53.800> visible<00:02:54.070> so<00:02:54.670> I'm<00:02:55.120> going

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
it's not quite as visible so I'm going

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.000 
it's not quite as visible so I'm going
to<00:02:55.420> change<00:02:55.690> the<00:02:55.870> opacity<00:02:55.960> on<00:02:56.740> that<00:02:56.920> from<00:02:57.700> 40

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
to change the opacity on that from 40

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.949 
to change the opacity on that from 40
two-sixty<00:03:00.640> just<00:03:01.150> to<00:03:01.239> make<00:03:01.390> it<00:03:01.540> a<00:03:01.599> little<00:03:01.750> bit

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
two-sixty just to make it a little bit

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.199 
two-sixty just to make it a little bit
clearer<00:03:02.370> now<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:03.459> next<00:03:03.730> thing<00:03:03.849> i<00:03:03.939> want<00:03:04.120> to

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
clearer now the next thing i want to

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:05.940 
clearer now the next thing i want to
change<00:03:04.420> i<00:03:04.750> want<00:03:05.019> to<00:03:05.200> make<00:03:05.319> it<00:03:05.439> a<00:03:05.470> bit<00:03:05.560> smaller

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
change i want to make it a bit smaller

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.530 
change i want to make it a bit smaller
because<00:03:06.189> it's<00:03:06.430> a<00:03:06.519> bit<00:03:06.700> of<00:03:06.790> truce<00:03:07.060> if<00:03:07.269> stuck

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
because it's a bit of truce if stuck

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.539 
because it's a bit of truce if stuck
right<00:03:07.840> in<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:07.989> middle<00:03:08.140> there<00:03:08.409> so<00:03:09.220> the<00:03:09.340> default

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
right in the middle there so the default

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.589 
right in the middle there so the default
is<00:03:09.879> 15%<00:03:10.540> i'm<00:03:11.200> going<00:03:11.439> to<00:03:11.500> change<00:03:11.709> that<00:03:11.860> to<00:03:12.040> 8<00:03:12.599> so

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
is 15% i'm going to change that to 8 so

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.990 
is 15% i'm going to change that to 8 so
there<00:03:13.780> we<00:03:13.900> go<00:03:13.930> that's<00:03:14.379> much<00:03:14.799> more<00:03:15.010> like<00:03:15.250> it<00:03:15.489> now

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
there we go that's much more like it now

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.789 
there we go that's much more like it now
i<00:03:16.030> want<00:03:16.180> to<00:03:16.299> move<00:03:16.450> it<00:03:16.569> over<00:03:16.780> into<00:03:17.110> the<00:03:17.319> corner

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
i want to move it over into the corner

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.369 
i want to move it over into the corner
so<00:03:18.010> it's<00:03:18.190> even<00:03:18.940> less<00:03:19.150> obtrusive<00:03:19.450> so<00:03:20.110> i'm<00:03:20.200> going

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:20.379 
so it's even less obtrusive so i'm going

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:23.160 
so it's even less obtrusive so i'm going
to<00:03:20.440> use<00:03:20.769> the<00:03:20.950> slider<00:03:21.370> to<00:03:21.730> get<00:03:22.569> that<00:03:22.750> over<00:03:23.140> to

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
to use the slider to get that over to

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.860 
to use the slider to get that over to
there<00:03:23.530> and<00:03:24.489> move<00:03:24.730> it<00:03:24.909> down<00:03:25.150> a<00:03:25.180> little<00:03:25.450> bit<00:03:25.690> and

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
there and move it down a little bit and

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.940 
there and move it down a little bit and
that<00:03:26.799> is<00:03:26.920> fine<00:03:27.280> if<00:03:27.579> we<00:03:28.420> go<00:03:29.140> to<00:03:29.200> the<00:03:29.590> beginning

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
that is fine if we go to the beginning

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.649 
that is fine if we go to the beginning
of<00:03:30.010> the<00:03:30.069> timeline<00:03:30.340> you'll<00:03:31.180> see<00:03:31.420> that<00:03:31.569> our

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:31.659 
of the timeline you'll see that our

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:34.080 
of the timeline you'll see that our
timecode<00:03:32.349> is<00:03:32.650> all<00:03:33.069> zeroes<00:03:33.609> there<00:03:33.879> as<00:03:34.000> it

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
timecode is all zeroes there as it

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.559

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
see what's going on there if you come to

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.479 
see what's going on there if you come to
the<00:03:40.180> effect<00:03:40.510> controls<00:03:41.069> you'll<00:03:42.069> see<00:03:42.310> that

there's a setting called timecode source

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.039 
there's a setting called timecode source
at<00:03:45.400> the<00:03:45.519> moment<00:03:45.819> that's<00:03:45.909> set<00:03:46.180> to<00:03:46.209> media<00:03:46.659> we

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
at the moment that's set to media we

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.410 
at the moment that's set to media we
