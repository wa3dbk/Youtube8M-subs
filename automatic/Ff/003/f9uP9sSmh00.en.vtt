00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.779
 Today I mutate mutate times 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.360
 a few tips the last few days it was 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.010
 not important he is called and in such 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.490
 I like it again 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.310
 fifa too hot a gram it but today for 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.470
 some tips as you guys in the 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.390
 summer could cool off at this heat 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.970
 and she promised that holes 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.460
 today a basin view is the topic 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.410
 who a west pulls a castrate 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.779
 or the difference must be sterilized 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.360
 today some general questions about 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.120
 topic lawyers prefers to answer one 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.430
 So this theme blows a bit 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.829
 was more acute than what to do 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.239
 a puppy moves in, it comes next 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.870
 week so we do not have you 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.329
 to forget 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.550
 but because then much asked 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.739
 have the office in any case max week 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.739
 and now have fun with the video 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.220
 The first tip has something to do with water 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.229
 and of course you can with yours 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.030
 100 a lake then it is natural 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.830
 Make sure that dogs are allowed there 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.570
 are not necessarily linen 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.140
 then that does not do that much 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.320
 fun 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.060
 then you can of course like us 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.950
 Here we now have a pool 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.340
 bought because it is just such a mega hot 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.899
 was 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.479
 You can also put your dog in there 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:30.580
 let swimming pay attention 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.170
 if your klo does not do the dog 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.500
 it's up to us to swim in it 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.600
 not good for stallone for the skin then 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.880
 I recommend you so 100 pool 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.470
 Of course, they are more like something 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.159
 Expensive there is a cheaper 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:48.399
 alternative, this baby sand 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:50.799
 diagonally through water mussels the cost 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:53.049
 and ten euros are in two packs in 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.909
 even every baby market or hardware store 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:56.890
 I mean, too, and you can totally do it 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:00.270
 Just fill with water and that is 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.270
 then a small dog pole 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.590
 now wanted tip has something with cooling 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.019
 to do with food and that is what he is 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.629
 first our favorite variant the 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:16.129
 to fill accounts so completely 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:20.360
 maybe many of you are these 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:22.160
 little toys things where you something 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.930
 Treats can empathize 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.360
 Here we have done that now that 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.950
 we just worked wing taken 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.989
 but you can also liverwurst dogs 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.870
 or whatever you like into it from 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.670
 or cottage cheese, for example, does that for 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.709
 a few hours into the freezer 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.690
 we always make that stay is on 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.640
 each case properly frozen and 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.200
 then the dog has a really great 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.360
 cooling to the he also one 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.260
 a little bit longer and something 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.260
 to lick 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:02.440
 the second edible refrigeration are 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.450
 I call the liver sausage ice cream itself 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.600
 made and indeed need it easy 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.430
 just a normal dice shape now 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.050
 I have these poultry again here 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.850
 fit taken from trixi there you can 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.740
 again cottage cheese or dogs 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.600
 liver sausage whatever you like there 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.550
 but also comes in fruit whatever 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.620
 and then you just feel one more 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.710
 a little bit of water over it that too 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.270
 He is the here so little ice cube 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.370
 Of course, sawing is not that appetizing 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.320
 out but for the dog that is also a 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.470
 Nice cooling and it seems too 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.470
 taste 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.530
 So theoretically do the first thing 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.020
 should if too hot what is your dogs 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.760
 neatly brush that whole 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.250
 so come out of the roll of course 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.930
 In addition, the whole hair warms the 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.520
 maybe already failed though 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.040
 somehow still hanging in the field inside 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.980
 This brushes the dog with relief 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.440
 already tremendously and yes that with the 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.380
 air circulation here especially at 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.360
 low at the double fell is that 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.820
 really a relief for the dog 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.410
 and yes there will be in any case 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.410
 first brush the dogs properly 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.030
 As a last tip we have one for you 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:27.430
 cool heitz tied and that we had 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.750
 in our surprise dog box 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.340
 box for dogs in it 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.780
 I have an honest beginning 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.610
 bit skeptical but the thing is 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.970
 Great and I think I think so too 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.090
 Great 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.160
 you need them just in below 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.680
 Keep cold water and a bit 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.330
 soak and then these are pearls 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.120
 those in there are the ruling ones with the 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.470
 water and then get cold and that 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.560
 you can just your dog and the 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:52.389
 tie neck and then have one too 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.039
 great cooling especially dog I think 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:55.599
 also very practical for example for 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:57.639
 dogs that do not like to go into the water 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:00.509
 that at least a bit 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:00.509
 have cooling 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:15.580
 that was already with me replaced 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.440
 I hope there are a few things at the 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.930
 They also liked to inspire you 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.940
 if you can do for example 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.220
 This wonder after replenishment more 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.950
 of it but sometimes insight at a photo 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:29.770
 which variant has chosen and also in 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:33.510
 bunch that tasted and then would 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.510
 I'll say no to that
