00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 good lesson forever we are here in a 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.130
 new video of gta 5 and well then I come 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.230
 to give great news that has finally been 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.090
 already confirmed the exit of the blows of 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.679
 robberies to banks and also because 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.210
 has modified the output of the gta a bit 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.490
 for pc we hope that this is already the 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.780
 final dates although as you know no 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.369
 it's nothing safe but good 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.630
 is announced by rockstar I suppose 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.820
 when they have put it on and both were 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.619
 because it is definitive and good because 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.029
 basically the blows are going to come out 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.640
 bank robberies as you like to call 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.470
 on March 10th which is then 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.670
 practically already I was very 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.890
 close so we're going to be able to 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.420
 Enjoy it in a little bit and good 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.760
 since the output for pc has been set by 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.500
 April 14 I think it was on the 21st 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.320
 March in principle so they have 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.219
 delayed for half a month we could say 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.020
 and well, here what it tells us is that 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:48.719
 about bank robberies that are going to 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.910
 be very epic assaults that we will be able to 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.500
 do it between four players that good 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.030
 because inside what is a robbery we go 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.770
 to have to do many things not only 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.809
 go to rob the bank but we have to 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.000
 got out to get a car or do we have to 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.360
 go to 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.739
 I do not know how to get a truck I do not know 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.900
 anything you can send us 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.610
 spying on someone or whatever is not 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.320
 Well, they say you're going to be very 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.360
 well done they wanted it they have taken 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.190
 so much because they wanted to leave it very well 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.860
 done and very curious everything and well then 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.840
 basically they tell us a few things about 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.060
 this is worth I say more or less because that 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.410
 It's what I always tell us and good for 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.300
 the launch date seems to be going 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.490
 to be official because he is very close and 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.260
 they just gave that is that it is already official 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.940
 almost sure at least the blows are worth 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.410
 those of the blows is almost certain already and 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.270
 Well, they already tell us that the next 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.340
 week we will have more information about 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.200
 what will they tell us, I suppose 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.700
 will be putting new news and such and 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.680
 well then after we put some pictures 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.509
 down who follows her also teaching 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.940
 so you can see them in the video and also 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.500
 I will leave in the description the link to the 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.630
 news so you can read it and see 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.670
 you in detail later on the 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.590
 gta for pc tell us that the 14 will arrive 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.320
 April, as I said, well, well, 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.149
 has delayed a lot asking for forgiveness but 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.100
 is that they wanted it to go perfect and not 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.539
 there must be no defect that 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.160
 there were as few as possible wanted to include 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:03.409
 also robberies to banks already in the 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.860
 gta for pc and well that's why it's been 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.200
 to delay a little but 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.560
 Well, it's going to be the best version that 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.350
 there is for pc that is the best gta 5 that goes 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.870
 to have better graphics better of everything and 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.640
 Well what they expect to do well and 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.900
 that's good, that's why they're taking a 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.480
 little bit better as I said so that 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.940
 go everything perfect we already know that they are 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.710
 very professional in that that they 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.940
 always like everything goes well though 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.920
 then there is always something that goes wrong 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.810
 that is inevitable but good 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.450
 they simply tell us that as 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.790
 reward to give 200 thousand of money in 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.830
 the gta 5 of pc simply for 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.910
 compensate a little bit for the delay not and 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.830
 Well, afterwards they also tell you that 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.260
 if we have any failure during those 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.760
 first weeks of play whatever it is that 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.010
 they just put their contacts here 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.110
 to then tell your portal that 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.209
 one because they will try to fix what 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.890
 that users say they do not know what 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.660
 this happens, so simply 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.010
 you want to help it send if 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.989
 they will try to solve it 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.550
 then here as pictures to highlight then 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.700
 I can tell you that I see here 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:06.280
 very cool things for example there are like 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.780
 new clothes with masks and all these 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.370
 little things that good with clothes the truth 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.620
 is that she was very pretty after we have 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.610
 a kind of karim revel with a 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.930
 giant machine gun 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.440
 for it is behind that the truth is 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.150
 amazing or very handsome afterwards 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.010
 here we have some beautiful motorcycles 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.810
 also that they will be attacking on the motorcycle 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.630
 with a helmet and a super pretty clothes 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.790
 we also have around here because several 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.530
 photos there going up with masks the 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.990
 it's true that it's cool a lot after 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.460
 we have an airplane there too 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.650
 helicopters with the metra of now that 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:37.240
 the truth is that that is what the truth 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.280
 is that I'm really cool 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.110
 helicopters those kind of cars 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.810
 ice armored giants that the truth is 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.370
 which is very cool and good because after 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.530
 some more photos we also have a 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.380
 picture we're going in a spot and in the background 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.470
 you see a giant aircraft carrier or a 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.780
 carrier that's something I do not know or 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.730
 whether it comes out will be because it will be I do not know 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.980
 but it is quite a flip and molar 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.270
 very much so nothing then afterwards 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.310
 Here we have some more pictures 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.200
 simply with people in suits attacking 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.489
 the bank and such equal but good to 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.930
 highlight the helicopter with 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.700
 machine guns these cars 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.790
 armored vehicles with 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.110
 machine gun also new clothes 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.850
 is that the aircraft carrier has left me 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.620
 totally hallucinated and good and what if 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.400
 there is an aircraft carrier would be great and given 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.090
 all of them, I hope that I have 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.400
 liked 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.940
 where there are favorites and until next time 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.940
 goodbye
