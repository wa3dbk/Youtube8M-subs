00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:11.629
 And then, guys, beauty, Lucas. 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:14.449
 Welcome to another 4d movie trial. 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:17.119
 and in today's tutorial bringing you 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:18.830
 a nice club that is quite 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.740
 used to make animations of 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.050
 collision and explosion of texts and objects 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.909
 because it has a very good effect and is 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.829
 100 percent recommended 

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:29.989
 I 'm talking about the strause plugin 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:32.119
 many there must already know or should 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:34.760
 have heard I'm leaving him 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.290
 download in the description then after 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.720
 What you download is only you. 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.300
 unzip it with iha or any 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.940
 another program of the genre to copy it and 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.510
 4d movie directory and paste inside the 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.880
 folder 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.650
 the club is good now to give as 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.670
 I'm doing an example here. 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:55.040
 collision between a sphere and a text here 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:58.210
 to start creating a plan here to 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:01.940
 to serve as our ground is good 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.660
 about here that size is already okay 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.339
 good 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.350
 after we here created our 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:10.130
 pan we will come here in simulei tea 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.470
 of the link and client with the leader 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.800
 now the next step is to create a text 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:18.800
 so I had a monograph on a test that 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.229
 I'm going to change my text to tutorial ok 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.540
 and now I will win here in source and I will 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.460
 choose which font is a bit more 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.250
 Let's say this is so that our 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.320
 Mayor, stay as real as possible, okay. 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:35.870
 I will select the source here at home 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:39.590
 Charlie Brown 54 m ok 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:42.260
 it was here in the middle here in depp that the 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.420
 our depth change from 20 to 100 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.600
 and here in subdivision you can place 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.510
 between 1 and 10 is good in my case put 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.729
 here 10 and now with our text 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:56.420
 We selected you here 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:02:00.229
 plugins and let's activate our plugin 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.810
 Is it okay to have clips while the 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:06.260
 bit our text will be fragmented 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:09.140
 here in a house in the park 20 more in 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.150
 nothing in the attack on portunhol team already 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.120
 is doing is mentally minded in our 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.909
 text or late 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.069
 in several pieces so that when there is 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:20.980
 the effect is the most real 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.860
 possible here already you will see how 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:28.590
 it will be nice our effect then it is 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.590
 just wait and the process is over 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.829
 finished now we can close it here 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.319
 This girl I already do now 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:41.140
 we will create here a ball to someone 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:43.930
 hope it will collide with our text 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.829
 so I'll come here my camera or 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:50.109
 increase our sphere a little more 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:52.329
 At that time it's already good I'm going to a 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:54.609
 a little more in the middle here 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:57.190
 so it's great now with our sphere 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:03:01.090
 selected we will return here again in 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.049
 silence of linux and client hard ball 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.530
 fine 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:08.799
 and now what we do in our 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.019
 last piece of our text will hold 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.829
 shift and will stay here our first 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.200
 shock 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:17.590
 here we will come in the aba daniel ex 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.579
 buoy and will change immediately to a 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.400
 school 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:25.239
 Good now when you're good at what 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:28.480
 happens to a collision between our 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:30.669
 text and our sphere can see that it does 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.250
 a very nice effect is only you have 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:36.489
 creativity and that makes it possible to do 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.980
 a lot of things even with this effect ok 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:41.109
 Good people, this is what I hope you 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.030
 have enjoyed it if you liked leave the 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:45.579
 its range or if you're favorite 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.530
 Helping me a lot, okay, any questions. 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:50.440
 in relation to this tutorial leave the 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:56.310
 comments that soon I say ok 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.310
 Good guys, this is good and until the next
