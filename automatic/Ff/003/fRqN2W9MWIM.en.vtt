00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.920
 let the color express 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:16.619
 the intensity of all chanel looks 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.439
 is always at the forefront 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.660
 hello girls here I am to show you the 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:23.830
 new look that arrived today at 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.810
 shop 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.240
 my first video after the summer the 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:32.760
 first of many that will come 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:36.340
 and to show you a preview of the make-up 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:39.160
 autumn winter 2012 2013 of this 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:42.640
 fashion house behind the scenes of creation 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.969
 of this make up there is the creative genius 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.910
 of karl lagerfeld who then dictates them 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:53.019
 fashion lines has thought of consistencies 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:55.769
 shiny and precious minerals for this 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:58.660
 reason the beauty look was chosen 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:02.230
 it is completely concentrated not only 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.960
 on the look but also on the lips 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:08.400
 the complexion always remains faithful to the 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:12.460
 maison with a clear and bright face 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:16.030
 then fixed incredibly by the figures 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.369
 and from the illuminant that we will now go to 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.200
 to see 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.869
 here is where I show you is a trick 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.820
 really beautiful and I had already way 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.189
 to review my blog a 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:31.509
 July and now I'm here to be able to 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:35.170
 demonstrate impart their own by 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:39.130
 gaze framed by obvious lines 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:45.240
 has practically launched four colors 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:49.479
 of mono eye shadows from the effect 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.640
 pearly luminescent here they are if 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:56.289
 can you see them a golden one 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:02:00.969
 beige and champagne and a glittery gray 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:05.049
 and a darker gray for the choices it has 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:08.680
 always launched in the name 12 eyeshadows 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:12.760
 wanting to base and also to create a 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:19.150
 beginning of smokey eyes opaque the 83 slate 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:20.490
 and 84 there to create the shading e 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.720
 an effect 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:26.160
 the most obvious has created the four 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.040
 colors 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.430
 the premier regard where the beige is located 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.550
 in combination with a dove dot 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.340
 light and golden champagne but very light 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:42.210
 and the very dark gray to create a 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:45.140
 smoky eyes effect evident for how much 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:48.120
 concerns the illuminating lumiere 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:51.210
 firework which is an illuminant 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.970
 which can be applied before the blush 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:57.240
 on the cheekbones create a dot for you 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:00.300
 the whole central area of the front of the 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.100
 chin nose and even wanting 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.710
 dusted all over the face and the 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.470
 décolleté then the look will be 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.890
 framed by abolishing the double line of 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:14.160
 silver pencil eyeliner 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:17.160
 silverlight and from noir intense le 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.750
 pencils are the waterproof walks 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.780

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:32.390
 be used both for the upper rhyme 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:36.390
 eyelid and the lower eyelashes 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:40.230
 as for the pomat the blush has 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:44.550
 created a very natural delicate rosé 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:46.530
 which, however, defines the cheekbone well 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.800
 initial rose 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:52.380
 as you can obviously see from the photo 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:56.280
 here it is in combination with the color of the 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:59.750
 lipstick that we're going to see now 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:04.140
 lipsticks are two of the cuckoo line 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:06.210
 charm that an antique rose is the color 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:10.410

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:17.160
 paired with his pencil which is the 54th 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.950
 marant that of the new collection is the 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.410
 nature that instead proposed it again for 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:25.110
 the two new colors he launched of 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:28.800

 instead the perfect one 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:42.240
 and a rosé a little ancient but always 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:46.620
 natural to want to use alone 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:49.740
 or in combination with the two colors either 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.860
