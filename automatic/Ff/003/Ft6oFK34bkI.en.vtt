00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.250

of<00:04:32.960> the<00:04:33.080> film<00:04:33.410> I<00:04:33.710> mean<00:04:34.070> the<00:04:34.160> video<00:04:34.400> I<00:04:35.200> want<00:04:36.200> to

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
of the film I mean the video I want to

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.240 
of the film I mean the video I want to
know<00:04:36.380> your<00:04:36.530> thoughts<00:04:36.560> on<00:04:36.830> that<00:04:36.890> is<00:04:37.100> that

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
know your thoughts on that is that

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.540 
know your thoughts on that is that
really<00:04:37.790> gonna<00:04:38.330> show<00:04:38.810> multiplayer<00:04:39.470> or<00:04:39.500> I<00:04:40.130> think

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
really gonna show multiplayer or I think

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.550 
really gonna show multiplayer or I think
it<00:04:40.669> showed<00:04:40.970> levels<00:04:41.419> which<00:04:42.260> what<00:04:42.440> they're

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
it showed levels which what they're

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.260 
it showed levels which what they're
saying<00:04:42.770> there<00:04:43.010> it<00:04:43.220> seems<00:04:43.490> like<00:04:43.700> single<00:04:44.030> player

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
saying there it seems like single player

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.240 
saying there it seems like single player
like<00:04:44.990> they<00:04:45.169> did<00:04:45.380> with<00:04:45.500> the<00:04:45.650> previous<00:04:45.800> Call<00:04:46.220> of

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
like they did with the previous Call of

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.680 
like they did with the previous Call of
Duty<00:04:46.490> which<00:04:46.700> is<00:04:46.850> interesting<00:04:47.360> because<00:04:47.390> you

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
Duty which is interesting because you

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.560 
Duty which is interesting because you
get<00:04:47.810> to<00:04:47.870> see<00:04:48.110> a<00:04:48.140> few<00:04:48.410> of<00:04:48.500> the<00:04:48.560> weapons<00:04:49.240> like<00:04:50.240> the

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:50.570 
get to see a few of the weapons like the

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.020 
get to see a few of the weapons like the
last<00:04:50.780> one<00:04:50.840> we<00:04:51.020> saw<00:04:51.050> storm<00:04:51.979> PSR<00:04:52.610> with

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.760 
last one we saw storm PSR with
we<00:04:53.240> were<00:04:53.360> all<00:04:53.570> fearing<00:04:53.960> it<00:04:54.020> being<00:04:54.200> multiplayer

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
we were all fearing it being multiplayer

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:00.940 
we were all fearing it being multiplayer
the<00:04:56.110> MA<00:04:57.110> the<00:04:58.070> type<00:04:58.370> 25<00:04:58.580> and<00:04:59.510> I<00:05:00.170> think<00:05:00.440> one<00:05:00.800> or

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
the MA the type 25 and I think one or

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.190 
the MA the type 25 and I think one or
two<00:05:01.190> other<00:05:01.540> guns<00:05:02.540> like<00:05:02.750> the<00:05:02.840> vector<00:05:03.140> or

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
two other guns like the vector or

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.260 
two other guns like the vector or
something<00:05:03.560> which<00:05:04.520> were<00:05:04.640> all<00:05:04.790> guns<00:05:05.120> that

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
something which were all guns that

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.760 
something which were all guns that

for<00:05:06.920> the<00:05:06.980> type<00:05:07.130> 25<00:05:07.280> because<00:05:08.000> we<00:05:08.390> already<00:05:08.510> sell

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750
