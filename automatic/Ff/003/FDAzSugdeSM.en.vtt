to the outside world safely as I say it
isn't<00:01:17.549> necessary<00:01:18.180> here<00:01:19.189> because<00:01:20.189> it's<00:01:20.490> a

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
isn't necessary here because it's a

ready for tightening up typically it's a

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.030 
ready for tightening up typically it's a
twelve<00:04:04.940> millimeter<00:04:05.209> spanner<00:04:05.930> but<00:04:06.650> you<00:04:06.799> need

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
twelve millimeter spanner but you need

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:16.300 
twelve millimeter spanner but you need
for<00:04:07.250> this<00:04:13.540> the<00:04:14.540> negative<00:04:15.110> side<00:04:15.380> should<00:04:16.040> drop

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
for this the negative side should drop

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:26.620 
for this the negative side should drop
on<00:04:16.519> as<00:04:16.669> well

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630
