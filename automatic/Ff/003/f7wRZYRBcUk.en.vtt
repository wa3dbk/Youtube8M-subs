00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
Harry Potter films have been out and

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.059 
Harry Potter films have been out and
what<00:02:49.980> can<00:02:50.130> I<00:02:50.220> say<00:02:50.430> that's<00:02:50.910> bloody<00:02:51.269> epic

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
what can I say that's bloody epic

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.039 
what can I say that's bloody epic
although<00:02:53.069> although<00:02:53.880> that<00:02:54.150> he<00:02:54.239> doesn't<00:02:54.630> scream

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
although although that he doesn't scream

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.860 
although although that he doesn't scream
as<00:02:55.380> much<00:02:55.410> as<00:02:56.069> he<00:02:56.400> did<00:02:56.579> in<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.819> last<00:02:56.849> trailer<00:02:57.599> I

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
as much as he did in the last trailer I

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.240 
as much as he did in the last trailer I
think<00:02:58.079> though<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.260> more<00:02:58.530> screens<00:02:59.010> have<00:02:59.190> been

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
think though the more screens have been

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.089 
think though the more screens have been
too<00:02:59.730> much<00:03:00.060> like<00:03:00.420> every<00:03:01.319> line<00:03:01.530> of<00:03:01.560> dialogue<00:03:01.709> I

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
too much like every line of dialogue I

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:11.590 
too much like every line of dialogue I
hear

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.300 

it's<00:03:12.600> a<00:03:12.660> bit<00:03:12.870> out<00:03:13.560> of<00:03:13.680> that<00:03:13.800> a<00:03:13.830> bit<00:03:14.010> annoying

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
it's a bit out of that a bit annoying

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.200 
it's a bit out of that a bit annoying
but<00:03:14.790> I<00:03:15.000> guess<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.810> filmmakers<00:03:16.560> just<00:03:17.210> wanted

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
but I guess the filmmakers just wanted

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.300 
but I guess the filmmakers just wanted
to<00:03:18.330> get<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.600> impression<00:03:18.840> that<00:03:19.020> he's<00:03:19.410> being

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
to get the impression that he's being

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.420 
to get the impression that he's being
defeated<00:03:20.700> on<00:03:21.060> something<00:03:21.480> at<00:03:21.690> last<00:03:21.930> I<00:03:22.500> don't

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
defeated on something at last I don't

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.340 
defeated on something at last I don't
know<00:03:23.490> in<00:03:24.330> any<00:03:24.540> way<00:03:24.780> a<00:03:25.970> lot<00:03:26.970> of<00:03:27.060> CGI<00:03:27.300> yes<00:03:27.990> I<00:03:28.200> hope

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
know in any way a lot of CGI yes I hope

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.910 
know in any way a lot of CGI yes I hope
the<00:03:28.530> CGI<00:03:28.890> doesn't<00:03:29.310> become<00:03:29.610> too<00:03:30.830> dominant<00:03:31.830> of

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
the CGI doesn't become too dominant of

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.710 
the CGI doesn't become too dominant of
the<00:03:31.980> film<00:03:32.310> anything<00:03:32.940> you<00:03:33.030> know<00:03:33.150> what<00:03:33.330> I<00:03:33.360> mean<00:03:33.540> I
