00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480 

in<00:00:00.750> this<00:00:01.079> video<00:00:01.319> we're<00:00:01.680> going<00:00:01.860> to<00:00:01.949> look<00:00:02.190> at<00:00:02.340> how

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
in this video we're going to look at how

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.990 
in this video we're going to look at how
to<00:00:02.550> round<00:00:03.120> the<00:00:03.480> number<00:00:04.069> 159<00:00:05.069> to<00:00:05.609> the<00:00:05.730> nearest

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
to round the number 159 to the nearest

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.540 
to round the number 159 to the nearest
hundred<00:00:06.870> now<00:00:07.680> that<00:00:07.890> means<00:00:08.160> that<00:00:08.280> we're

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
hundred now that means that we're

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.060 
hundred now that means that we're
focused<00:00:09.120> on<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.570> number<00:00:09.929> in<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.380> hundreds

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
focused on the number in the hundreds

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.890 
focused on the number in the hundreds
place<00:00:11.160> and<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.820> number<00:00:12.090> in<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.420> tens<00:00:12.690> place

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
place and the number in the tens place

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.390 
place and the number in the tens place
and<00:00:13.349> I'm<00:00:13.440> going<00:00:13.559> to<00:00:13.620> look<00:00:13.769> at<00:00:13.920> how<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.099> round

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
and I'm going to look at how to round

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.849 
and I'm going to look at how to round
this<00:00:14.610> in<00:00:14.820> two<00:00:15.059> different<00:00:15.389> ways<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:16.500> first<00:00:16.710> way

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
this in two different ways the first way

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.370 
this in two different ways the first way
will<00:00:17.130> be<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.369> just<00:00:17.580> focus<00:00:17.940> on<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.900> different

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
will be to just focus on the different

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.820 
will be to just focus on the different
digits<00:00:19.830> in<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.820> various<00:00:21.210> places<00:00:21.470> so<00:00:22.470> first

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
digits in the various places so first

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:23.990 
digits in the various places so first
thing<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.160> we're<00:00:23.279> looking<00:00:23.430> for<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:23.850> we're

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
thing that we're looking for is we're

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.150 
thing that we're looking for is we're
looking<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.420> round<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.289> nearest<00:00:25.380> hundred

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
looking to round to the nearest hundred

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.920 
looking to round to the nearest hundred
which<00:00:26.369> means<00:00:26.699> that<00:00:26.970> this<00:00:27.150> number<00:00:27.539> here<00:00:27.750> the

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
which means that this number here the

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.009 
which means that this number here the
one<00:00:28.199> is<00:00:28.529> either<00:00:29.160> going<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.609> remain<00:00:29.939> one<00:00:30.330> or<00:00:30.660> be

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
one is either going to remain one or be

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.860 
one is either going to remain one or be
rounded<00:00:31.470> up<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:32.040> two<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.700> that<00:00:33.270> all<00:00:33.480> depends

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
rounded up to a two and that all depends

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.040 
rounded up to a two and that all depends
on<00:00:34.079> what<00:00:34.290> number<00:00:34.680> we<00:00:34.829> have<00:00:34.860> in<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.399> tens<00:00:35.640> place

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
on what number we have in the tens place

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.560 
on what number we have in the tens place
so<00:00:37.050> in<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.590> tens<00:00:37.860> place<00:00:38.010> if<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.640> number<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:38.969> 5

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
so in the tens place if the number is 5

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.530 
so in the tens place if the number is 5
or<00:00:39.989> above<00:00:40.020> that<00:00:40.739> means<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.820> we<00:00:41.940> are<00:00:41.969> going<00:00:42.270> to

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
or above that means that we are going to

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.830 
or above that means that we are going to
round<00:00:42.899> up<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.489> hundreds<00:00:44.910> place<00:00:45.000> if<00:00:45.539> the

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
round up in the hundreds place if the

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.709 
round up in the hundreds place if the
number<00:00:46.110> is<00:00:46.140> four<00:00:46.559> or<00:00:46.739> below<00:00:47.539> then<00:00:48.539> the

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
number is four or below then the

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.209 
number is four or below then the
hundreds<00:00:49.020> place<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.350> going<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.620> stay<00:00:49.890> what<00:00:50.100> it

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
hundreds place is going to stay what it

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.700 
hundreds place is going to stay what it
was<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.399> one<00:00:50.789> as<00:00:51.030> we<00:00:51.690> can<00:00:51.840> see<00:00:52.020> however<00:00:52.230> we<00:00:52.530> have

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
was a one as we can see however we have

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.590 
was a one as we can see however we have
the<00:00:52.829> number<00:00:52.980> five<00:00:53.460> here<00:00:53.850> which<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.270> enough<00:00:54.570> to

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
the number five here which is enough to

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.860 
the number five here which is enough to
round<00:00:54.989> up<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:56.129> this<00:00:56.370> one<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:57.030> going<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.480> become

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
round up so this one is going to become

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.580 
round up so this one is going to become
a<00:00:58.050> two<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:59.270> every<00:01:00.270> number<00:01:00.510> after<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:01.410> is

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
a two and every number after that is

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.880 
a two and every number after that is
going<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.039> become<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.520> 0<00:01:03.080> so<00:01:04.080> when<00:01:04.379> we<00:01:04.500> round<00:01:04.769> to

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
going to become a 0 so when we round to

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.660 
going to become a 0 so when we round to
the<00:01:04.920> nearest<00:01:05.040> hundred<00:01:06.979> 159<00:01:07.979> will<00:01:08.250> become<00:01:08.869> 200

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
the nearest hundred 159 will become 200

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.090 
the nearest hundred 159 will become 200
looking<00:01:11.670> at<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.030> same<00:01:12.270> thing<00:01:12.689> on<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.500> number

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
looking at the same thing on a number

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.080 
looking at the same thing on a number
line<00:01:14.630> the<00:01:15.630> different<00:01:16.020> hundreds<00:01:16.470> would<00:01:17.220> be<00:01:17.369> 100

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
line the different hundreds would be 100

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.700 
line the different hundreds would be 100
would<00:01:18.390> be<00:01:18.509> what<00:01:18.900> would<00:01:18.990> happen<00:01:19.290> if<00:01:19.380> we<00:01:19.500> round

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
would be what would happen if we round

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.550 
would be what would happen if we round
down<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.570> 200<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.689> what<00:01:21.840> we<00:01:21.960> get<00:01:22.170> if<00:01:22.259> we<00:01:22.290> round

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
down and 200 is what we get if we round

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.760 
down and 200 is what we get if we round
it<00:01:22.740> up<00:01:23.030> let's<00:01:24.030> just<00:01:24.119> make<00:01:24.390> sure<00:01:24.600> here<00:01:24.840> 10<00:01:25.080> 20<00:01:25.500> 30

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
it up let's just make sure here 10 20 30

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.340 
it up let's just make sure here 10 20 30
40<00:01:26.280> 50<00:01:26.580> 60<00:01:27.210> 70<00:01:27.689> 80<00:01:27.990> 90<00:01:28.490> good<00:01:29.490> so<00:01:30.270> since<00:01:31.140> we<00:01:31.320> have

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
40 50 60 70 80 90 good so since we have

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.190 
40 50 60 70 80 90 good so since we have
100<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.100> 200<00:01:32.640> on<00:01:32.759> this<00:01:32.880> number<00:01:33.240> line<00:01:33.270> each<00:01:33.869> of

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
100 and 200 on this number line each of

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.649 
100 and 200 on this number line each of
these<00:01:34.380> dashes<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.700> going<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.090> represent<00:01:36.240> an

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
these dashes is going to represent an

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:43.569 
these dashes is going to represent an
increase<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.140> 10<00:01:37.619> so<00:01:38.340> 110<00:01:38.880> 120<00:01:39.600> 130<00:01:41.210> 140<00:01:42.210> 150

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
increase of 10 so 110 120 130 140 150

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:51.200 
increase of 10 so 110 120 130 140 150
160<00:01:44.689> 170<00:01:46.220> 180<00:01:47.930> 190<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.350> 200<00:01:50.130> now<00:01:50.670> where<00:01:51.030> does

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
160 170 180 190 and 200 now where does

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.980 
160 170 180 190 and 200 now where does
159<00:01:52.079> fall<00:01:52.439> well<00:01:53.130> as<00:01:53.280> in<00:01:53.430> between<00:01:53.729> 150<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:54.360> 160

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
159 fall well as in between 150 and 160

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.800 
159 fall well as in between 150 and 160
but<00:01:55.229> it's<00:01:55.350> closer<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.829> 160<00:01:56.610> now<00:01:57.360> looking<00:01:57.659> at

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
but it's closer to 160 now looking at

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.899 
but it's closer to 160 now looking at
the<00:01:57.930> placement<00:01:58.439> of<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:58.649> right<00:01:58.860> there<00:01:59.159> I<00:01:59.369> could

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
the placement of it right there I could

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.760 
the placement of it right there I could
see<00:02:00.210> just<00:02:00.689> by<00:02:00.869> looking<00:02:01.259> at<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:01.619> it's

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
see just by looking at it that it's

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.749 
see just by looking at it that it's
closer<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.520> 200<00:02:03.360> than<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:03.630> is<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.930> 100<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:05.100> we're

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
closer to 200 than it is to 100 so we're

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.330 
closer to 200 than it is to 100 so we're
going<00:02:05.939> to<00:02:06.119> round<00:02:06.360> up<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.750> 200<00:02:07.350> this<00:02:07.920> shows<00:02:08.160> you

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
going to round up to 200 this shows you

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.309 
going to round up to 200 this shows you
two<00:02:08.640> different<00:02:08.970> ways<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.420> round<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.050> number

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
two different ways to round the number

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.629 
two different ways to round the number
159<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.879> nearest<00:02:12.090> hundred
