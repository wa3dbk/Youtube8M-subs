connections<00:01:52.790> one<00:01:53.790> was<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.149> fat<00:01:54.390> one<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.869> then

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
connections one was the fat one and then

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.730 
connections one was the fat one and then
the<00:01:55.079> other<00:01:55.229> one<00:01:55.380> was<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.770> one<00:01:56.219> with<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.520> spring

the other one was to one with the spring

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.610 
the other one was to one with the spring
and<00:01:57.920> then<00:01:58.460> I<00:01:58.700> tacked<00:01:59.210> it<00:01:59.390> all<00:01:59.510> in<00:01:59.750> put<00:02:00.440> some

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
stuff in here to secure it and then I

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.020 
stuff in here to secure it and then I
sprayed<00:02:06.710> some<00:02:06.800> stuff<00:02:07.130> here<00:02:07.310> to<00:02:07.400> waterproof<00:02:07.850> it

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
sprayed some stuff here to waterproof it

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.450 
sprayed some stuff here to waterproof it
and<00:02:08.179> stuff<00:02:08.390> put<00:02:08.630> some<00:02:08.810> stuff<00:02:09.050> in<00:02:09.200> here

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
and stuff put some stuff in here

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.850 
and stuff put some stuff in here
electrical<00:02:10.460> tape<00:02:10.640> and<00:02:10.789> then<00:02:11.030> duct<00:02:11.300> taped<00:02:11.600> it

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
electrical tape and then duct taped it

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.040 
electrical tape and then duct taped it
with<00:02:12.860> a<00:02:13.090> first<00:02:14.090> I<00:02:14.240> put<00:02:14.420> another<00:02:14.690> piece<00:02:14.990> of

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
with a first I put another piece of

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.960 
with a first I put another piece of
plastic<00:02:15.350> in<00:02:15.770> there<00:02:15.950> cut<00:02:16.459> it<00:02:16.550> out

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
plastic in there cut it out

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.710 
plastic in there cut it out
that<00:02:17.390> so<00:02:17.900> it<00:02:18.110> fits<00:02:18.530> perfect<00:02:19.400> in<00:02:19.490> here<00:02:19.670> and<00:02:20.060> then

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
that so it fits perfect in here and then

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.050 
that so it fits perfect in here and then
electrical<00:02:21.500> tape<00:02:21.680> and<00:02:21.860> then<00:02:22.250> duct<00:02:22.520> taped<00:02:22.850> it

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
electrical tape and then duct taped it

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.920 
electrical tape and then duct taped it
and<00:02:23.720> then<00:02:24.200> this<00:02:24.470> bracket<00:02:25.240> this<00:02:26.240> bracket<00:02:26.660> fits

and then this bracket this bracket fits
right<00:02:27.200> back<00:02:27.410> in<00:02:27.620> there<00:02:33.700> these<00:02:34.700> ties<00:02:35.030> right

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
right back in there these ties right

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.120 
right back in there these ties right
here<00:02:35.709> my<00:02:36.709> battery<00:02:37.070> the<00:02:37.880> inside<00:02:38.239> of<00:02:38.360> the<00:02:38.450> body

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
here my battery the inside of the body

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.949 
here my battery the inside of the body
and<00:02:40.130> then<00:02:40.580> grant<00:02:40.910> cut<00:02:41.360> a<00:02:41.390> piece<00:02:41.570> out<00:02:41.750> of<00:02:41.810> the
