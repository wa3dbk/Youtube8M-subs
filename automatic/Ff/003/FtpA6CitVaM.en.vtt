there are windows pcs playing against
yeah<00:00:36.870> well<00:00:37.050> go<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.530> check<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:37.920> out<00:00:37.950> now<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:38.879> see

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
yeah well go to check that out now I see

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.180 
yeah well go to check that out now I see
that<00:00:39.329> as<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.660> first<00:00:39.960> definitely<00:00:40.440> first-person

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
that as a first definitely first-person

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.119 
that as a first definitely first-person
shooter<00:00:41.489> so<00:00:42.210> what<00:00:42.960> can<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.170> do<00:00:43.440> about<00:00:43.739> the

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
shooter so what can you do about the

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.069 
shooter so what can you do about the
fact<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.579> pc<00:00:45.180> gamers<00:00:45.510> have<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.719> slight

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
fact that pc gamers have a slight

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.229 
fact that pc gamers have a slight
advantage<00:00:46.110> with<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.160> mouse<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.399> keyboard<00:00:47.789> I

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
advantage with the mouse and keyboard I

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.139 
advantage with the mouse and keyboard I
mean<00:00:48.420> arguably<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.860> we<00:00:50.640> spent<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:50.910> lot<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.059> time

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
mean arguably so we spent a lot of time

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.790 
mean arguably so we spent a lot of time
balancing<00:00:51.690> controls<00:00:52.079> obviously<00:00:52.530> we<00:00:52.620> play

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
balancing controls obviously we play

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.729 
balancing controls obviously we play
both<00:00:52.980> PC<00:00:53.399> vs<00:00:53.940> 360<00:00:54.480> we<00:00:54.660> play<00:00:54.840> with<00:00:55.110> keyboard<00:00:55.559> and

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
both PC vs 360 we play with keyboard and

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.350 
both PC vs 360 we play with keyboard and
mouse<00:00:55.800> we<00:00:56.070> play<00:00:56.250> with<00:00:56.399> controller<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.300> we

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
mouse we play with controller and we

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.580 
mouse we play with controller and we
feel<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.539> both<00:00:57.750> are<00:00:57.930> equally<00:00:58.230> awesome<00:00:58.350> at

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
feel that both are equally awesome at

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.959 
feel that both are equally awesome at
this<00:00:58.739> point<00:00:58.920> we've<00:00:59.370> done<00:00:59.609> some<00:00:59.789> things

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
this point we've done some things

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.580 
this point we've done some things
obviously<00:01:00.480> we're<00:01:00.840> trying<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.109> balance<00:01:01.230> mount

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
obviously we're trying to balance mount

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.590 
obviously we're trying to balance mount
make<00:01:01.739> them<00:01:01.859> fair<00:01:02.180> we<00:01:03.180> don't<00:01:03.270> think<00:01:03.480> that

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
make them fair we don't think that

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.759 
make them fair we don't think that
either<00:01:03.629> want<00:01:03.989> us<00:01:04.049> an<00:01:04.199> advantage<00:01:04.470> at<00:01:04.680> this

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
either want us an advantage at this

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.890
