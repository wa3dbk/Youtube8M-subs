00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.189 
I don't know like 120,000 dollars it was
ridiculous<00:00:34.770> this<00:00:35.520> is<00:00:35.700> more<00:00:36.450> reasonable<00:00:37.170> and

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:37.199 
ridiculous this is more reasonable and

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:40.549 
ridiculous this is more reasonable and
this<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.679> believe<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:38.030> the<00:00:39.030> third<00:00:39.530> type<00:00:40.530> of

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
this is I believe the the third type of

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.220 
this is I believe the the third type of
watch<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.309> use<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.640> style<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.179> was<00:00:42.269> a<00:00:42.329> split

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
which i think is kind of cool and then

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:11.229 
which i think is kind of cool and then

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
the Porsche Carrera GT which is a super

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.400 
the Porsche Carrera GT which is a super
car<00:02:33.370> made<00:02:33.580> in<00:02:33.820> I<00:02:34.270> don't<00:02:34.870> know<00:02:34.960> I<00:02:34.990> think<00:02:35.140> like

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
car made in I don't know I think like

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.430 
car made in I don't know I think like
2004<00:02:36.340> to<00:02:36.460> 2006<00:02:37.420> and<00:02:37.630> it<00:02:37.690> was<00:02:37.780> a<00:02:37.840> very<00:02:38.260> very

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
2004 to 2006 and it was a very very

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.140 
2004 to 2006 and it was a very very
expensive<00:02:38.770> car<00:02:39.190> I<00:02:39.250> think<00:02:39.430> it<00:02:39.580> was<00:02:39.670> half<00:02:40.000> a

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
expensive car I think it was half a

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.100 
expensive car I think it was half a
million<00:02:40.420> dollars<00:02:40.690> or<00:02:40.810> something<00:02:40.990> like<00:02:41.050> that

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
million dollars or something like that

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.890 
million dollars or something like that
and<00:02:41.500> that<00:02:42.060> $120,000<00:02:43.060> watch<00:02:43.270> was<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.630> one<00:02:43.780> to

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
and that $120,000 watch was the one to

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.710 
and that $120,000 watch was the one to
go<00:02:44.020> with<00:02:44.170> it<00:02:44.350> and<00:02:45.130> this<00:02:45.730> one<00:02:46.000> continues<00:02:46.570> that

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
go with it and this one continues that

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.030 
go with it and this one continues that

one<00:03:17.500> thing<00:03:17.710> which<00:03:17.860> is<00:03:18.040> I<00:03:18.310> guess<00:03:19.000> maybe<00:03:19.450> a

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
one thing which is I guess maybe a

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.450 
one thing which is I guess maybe a
little<00:03:19.750> bit<00:03:19.960> tough<00:03:20.230> is<00:03:20.500> the<00:03:20.950> fact<00:03:21.190> that<00:03:21.280> it

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.460 
little bit tough is the fact that it

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.680 
little bit tough is the fact that it
does<00:03:21.640> have<00:03:21.850> one<00:03:21.880> of<00:03:22.060> those<00:03:22.120> straps<00:03:22.390> you<00:03:22.630> have

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
does have one of those straps you have

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.980 
does have one of those straps you have
to<00:03:22.960> cut<00:03:23.790> which<00:03:24.790> basically<00:03:25.150> means<00:03:25.540> that<00:03:25.690> you

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:25.990 
to cut which basically means that you

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.900 
to cut which basically means that you
know<00:03:26.080> once<00:03:26.290> you<00:03:26.440> cut<00:03:26.620> it<00:03:26.650> that's<00:03:26.950> it<00:03:27.130> you<00:03:27.700> can't

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
know once you cut it that's it you can't

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.340 
know once you cut it that's it you can't
really<00:03:27.970> exchange<00:03:28.510> it<00:03:28.630> with<00:03:28.720> your<00:03:28.840> friends<00:03:29.200> and

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
really exchange it with your friends and

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:30.840 
really exchange it with your friends and
they<00:03:29.410> can't<00:03:29.620> wear<00:03:29.740> and<00:03:29.920> things<00:03:30.070> like<00:03:30.250> that<00:03:30.400> it

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
they can't wear and things like that it
