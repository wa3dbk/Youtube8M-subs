boards<00:02:00.299> three<00:02:01.079> monkey<00:02:01.530> peg<00:02:01.799> boards<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.700> I

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
boards three monkey peg boards and I

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.370 
boards three monkey peg boards and I
think<00:02:03.090> these<00:02:03.210> are<00:02:03.270> so<00:02:03.780> cute

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
think these are so cute

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.410 
think these are so cute
tons<00:02:05.009> of<00:02:05.369> heart<00:02:05.790> peg<00:02:06.090> boys<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.750> have<00:02:07.290> some<00:02:07.649> white

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
tons of heart peg boys I have some white

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.010 
tons of heart peg boys I have some white
pegboard<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:09.660> believe<00:02:10.050> this<00:02:10.229> one<00:02:10.470> is<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.800> dog

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
pegboard I believe this one is a dog

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.580 
pegboard I believe this one is a dog
and<00:02:12.110> then<00:02:12.290> I<00:02:12.320> guess<00:02:12.620> this<00:02:12.860> one<00:02:13.040> is<00:02:13.070> like<00:02:13.400> a<00:02:13.610> cat

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
and then I guess this one is like a cat

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.170 
and then I guess this one is like a cat
and<00:02:15.590> then<00:02:15.770> this<00:02:15.920> one<00:02:16.190> I<00:02:16.220> really<00:02:16.370> don't<00:02:16.880> know<00:02:17.030> it

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
and then this one I really don't know it

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.570 
and then this one I really don't know it
might<00:02:17.360> be<00:02:17.390> a<00:02:17.870> boy<00:02:18.440> or<00:02:18.800> like<00:02:18.950> a<00:02:19.010> penguin<00:02:19.550> or

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
might be a boy or like a penguin or

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.850 
might be a boy or like a penguin or
something<00:02:20.150> probably<00:02:20.750> not<00:02:21.170> a<00:02:21.200> boy<00:02:21.440> now<00:02:21.710> it

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
something probably not a boy now it

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:22.810 
something probably not a boy now it
looks<00:02:22.040> like<00:02:22.100> a<00:02:22.220> penguin

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
looks like a penguin

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.120 
looks like a penguin
