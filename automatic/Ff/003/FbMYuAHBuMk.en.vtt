00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.910
 how come the micro friends my club 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:21.369
 there it is today and days 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.289
 this time it's about the black in play 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.050
 heart for baguette because i'm minecraft 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:27.640
 pocket exactly 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.500
 yes you are now wondering where am 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.119
 I just want it to be an old one 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.399
 I had chosen one for me 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:37.000
 server has built for me but to do so 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:39.550
 later more about mesmer to the plug-in 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.809
 quite simply we give a bad 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.079
 ph 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:46.840
 for blade of the born and then the name 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.850
 the head for example minecraft bucket 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.100
 I want to head my player now 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.590
 and I want that too 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.030
 Give players a minecraft bucket and that 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.090
 are the number for example one 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.060
 share of 20 I get a 20s 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.800
 number of minecraft backes mind yes 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.619
 that's the deep-drawn head , though 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.270
 if I place it now hangs here 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:08.380
 my head you can compare it 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.040
 I'll stand next to it 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:14.200
 it is exactly the same bulb as here 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.149
 So completely the same and that is 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.920
 just come for there to me for 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:19.510
 Just give your spawn to the server 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.090
 to modify it and he says it now 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.770
 the app now looks like this then behind 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.680
 just keep your head on it so completely 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.510
 just hang on it so you can 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.549
 just keep players heads as well 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.710
 city, so to speak, still creates it 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:35.350
 are any zombie heads or are 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.430
 other heads just that we can 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.110
 but we also have to rename it now 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.970
 Plan and say ten to twenty heads 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.260
 but I have no desire for that 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.150
 you still have heads of that 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:48.220
 I would like to rename 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:50.710
 I give a phd and then the new one 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.720
 For example, players took as an example 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.460
 the cronk I just sit down now 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.380
 and now I can take my head off 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.630
 concrete running or we take as 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.160
 for now at times for example 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.380
 which player names do I know now 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.320
 still the mountain summit 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.550
 then I grab the top of the mountain 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.350
 put it on and then I have the 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.660
 head of tool trust i believe 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.780
 that's wrong, that's not his head 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.930
 I have to write the name small 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.720
 outside else likes exactly is 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.150
 now a head not in the head very much 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.170
 weird but okay and then you can 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.340
 just hang on the wall 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.380
 maybe just that one with you 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.170
 So, make a nice shield outfit so easy 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.640
 a shield to take you in hand and 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.970
 that he put it then it stops 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:38.430
 here the link and write about it 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:41.410
 breathe blababla and then 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.510
 owner or other things thinks something 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.070
 then confirms it then sees that 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.900
 but actually quite nice or so 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.370
 I think that's really great here but 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.860
 you quickly remember sweater with it 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.390
 is bright again and then you can 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.790
 a change and then you have these 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.440
 great player has and have your own 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.959
 fun for you to say that's it 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.340
 with the plugin that was small and me 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.050
 Just have something to say what that now 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.160
 with the map that has the people on it 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.930
 who can not care anymore 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.330
 turn off thank you for watching 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.840
 then you again and the rest can 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.550
 Now just keep watching, that's it 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.080
 just my map that is here that should 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.060
 just like an airship factory 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.519
 represent the lifewatch hammer for me 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.070
 you had built yourself here 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:23.019
 The station was started here 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.970
 it's all here in the area 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.769
 that you very much to the beautiful beautiful valley 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.970
 nice part 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.590
 and we even have one 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.730
 another airship water for me 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.650
 had built and here goes to 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.630
 water tower and quite a few 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.980
 things I had my map for one 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.570
 I have to prepare a server 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:42.070
 I honestly say I wanted one 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:44.170
 reopen server 445 months ago 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.250
 sometime last year it was so against 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.049
 winter exactly 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.239
 december christmas exactly in time 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:50.769
 was that there I have this built here 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.510
 with the life coaching resp 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.940
 he had built me and then have 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.950
 i said okay i can do that 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.660
 not implement and of you I would 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.730
 I would like to know you would like to 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.440
 easy server sometime again 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.150
 in the future I do not know 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.220
 because then I want to be so slow 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.020
 Maybe maybe I can meet you there 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.580
 I do not say it depends on how much 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.140
 time how much I enjoy myself so much 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.730
 Slowly alone again to the 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.710
 Project run dare a bit 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.270
 what to do and then me to the 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.810
 Put plugins on it and then you can 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:21.510
 I'll say okay then I would like 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.970
 I'm not sure why 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.230
 learn to do that and that's it 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.190
 Pay attention to that simple story 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.410
 In any case, I have now the place 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.150
 just picked out my videos here 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.560
 It's cool to choose out 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.540
 I quite thematically quite appropriate 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.740
 overall well designed and 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.200
 that's why I use it in now 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.850
 The future always needs to be as precise as possible 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.250
 to light up again is a bit 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.810
 dark but anyway I think to myself 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.700
 look please give a rating 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.140
 if you give your ratings off when 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:50.040
 you liked the video when i did 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:52.110
 also because reviews help us 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.670
 youtuber over and over to know what 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.050
 In the area we can improve myself 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.250
 thank you for watching me wish you 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:00.050

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.050
 concept but until today
