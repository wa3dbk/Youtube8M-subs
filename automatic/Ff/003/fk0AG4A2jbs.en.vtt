00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:23.279
 on January 22 , 1952 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:26.849
 approximately 11 hours and 40 minutes from 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.609
 night in the girl region north of the 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.120
 state of alaska united states 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.449
 the gift radar radar station 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:38.579
 located a strange object in the device 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:41.940
 flying over the region the fact is unusual 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.789
 since there were no air routes on that 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.530
 region and the only aircraft that 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.899
 another flew over the area was a baby 50 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:55.140
 used for meteorological studies 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:57.510
 who only flew during the day 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.120
 target was moving at a speed of 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.300
 approximately two thousand four hundred 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.580
 kilometers per hour and its altitude was 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.310
 about seven thousand meters 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.160
 the flight controller in service in that 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.400
 opportunity requested the sending of a 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:17.760
 hunt to intercept the base object 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.370
 nearest airspace was about 160 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:25.080
 kilometers south of the radar station and 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:27.900
 a f 94 fighter was already in the 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.930
 place a UFO flew in a straight line and 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.060
 He spent just 80 kilometers from the station 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.090
 when hunting advanced towards a 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.550
 object it suddenly decreased to 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.970
 speed hovered in the air momentarily 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:45.570
 and then went on very high 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.790
 speed towards the radar station 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.670
 the controller had to adjust in that 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.580
 the device for a short 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.610
 and for a moment lost the signal from the 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.820
 hunting and the UFO while trying 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.330
 to recover the signal the hunt went over 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.510
 of the controller's radar installations 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:09.570
 guided the pilot lieutenant ce galletti to 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.660
 around the place and try to find the 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.870
 object is not 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.720
 of the game but the pilot was almost 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:20.920
 and had to return to the base 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:23.470
 a second f 94 fighter was sent and 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.930
 again with the aircraft and advanced in 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.570
 towards the ovi he did maneuvers 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.420
 high speed 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:34.780
 from the other stationed in the air and always 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.120
 escape from radar 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.160
 times the controller team who set the 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.160
 range alternating between short and long 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.380
 not to miss the view object 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.690
 another interesting detail is that the 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:50.980
 variable radar signal between strong 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:54.850
 emitted and weak and faint the third hunt 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.850
 f 94 was also sent since the second 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.670
 without success and with little fuel after 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:03.580
 chasing the UFO for several minutes had 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.070
 to return to the base at any given time. 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.260
 third party had to carry out a 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.620
 abrupt maneuver one year the pilot 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:15.040
 target in front of you on the radar of 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:18.280
 so the pilot's fear was to collide with 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.770
 such object even during the persecution 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.830
 controller can observe through the 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:27.490
 Oil sign on the radar that he hung in 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:30.370
 air and suddenly dove lost 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:32.709
 quickly afterwards. 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.459
 controller has returned to the 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:38.709
 The object of hunting was only 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:41.380
 200 meters away from the UFO 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:45.700
 but none of those involved 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:48.730
 fact observe the object with naked eye the force 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.920
 American airman explained the episode as 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.560
 a powerful thermal inversion that 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.470
 confused the radar devices 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.650
 but this explanation did not convince 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:02.050
 no one even the officers of the force 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.410
 because a thermal inversion in that 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:08.020
 region is a very rare phenomenon and even 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:11.650
 that occurred would not present itself as 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:13.750
 a signal at 7 thousand meters of altitude 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.570
 another detail is the speed of the 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.440
 object and the fact that the time signal was 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.560
 strong 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.480
 now it was weak is that not 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.820
 occur phenomena of 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.880
 the thermal version the officers themselves 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.400
 involved did not agree with the version 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.980
 and were aware that 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.050
 it was a cover-up of what 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.270
 really happened 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.970
 although none of those involved 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:43.330
 seen man in fact his maneuvers 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:46.120
 abrupt and its incredible speed does not 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.400
 doubts as to the nature of the 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.920
 phenomenon is understandable that 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.320
 extraterrestrials are interested in this 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.520
 the most inhospitable and icy region of the planet 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.160
 Earth 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.860
 but the question that remains is why they 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.500
 did not leave the site and continued 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:05.740
 flying over the region as if provoking 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:09.220
 the hunts that followed him, do not
