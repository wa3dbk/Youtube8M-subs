00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.500
 I put cartoneras I am josema source 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.259
 and this is test mania in the mania of 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:34.660
 today we have an authentic missile that comes 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:39.980
 East of Poland specifically lacrosse 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:43.160
 level r plus a 27-inch cucumber and 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:46.160
 media that especially highlights a picture 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:50.030
 of great robust bill where the 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:52.040
 be with extraordinary stiffness that 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.970
 simply with you fixed on the edges 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:58.880
 of all its tubes gives us an idea of 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:01.520
 all that rigidity that is presupposed and 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:05.059
 that our test has given way 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:08.930
 outstanding an address for frei of 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:13.040
 what is to say conical an axis of 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:16.340
 press fit 30 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:20.440
 some pods of a section rather of 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:24.020
 angular they give incredible stiffness 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:27.500
 also also the section braces 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:30.680
 triangular they give a rigidity so much 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:34.040
 vertical as lateral 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:37.130
 I repeat incredible to give more 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.070
 stiffness if fits and accentuate a sleeping 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.650
 really pronounced we have high 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.320
 reinforcements on the seat post 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:48.560
 that if we continue the extension of this 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:52.610
 same tube we see the curvature that makes 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.800
 so that the wheels of 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.220
 this larger section that we were 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:01.220
 accustomed with 26-inch wheels 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:04.280
 a picture of extraordinary invoice 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:08.300
 that lightness does not prevail in this case 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.490
 but have a rigid and effective picture 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.530
 what is it about for the 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:17.030
 transmission has been chosen in this case 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:20.600
 by schramm a double xx full plate 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:23.210
 you have the leb the ere plus with the fist 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.420
 rotary is a statement of 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.060
 intentions at the time 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.910
 to change as quickly as possible not 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.569
 there is a change in the market with this 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.910
 precision and as fast as the round of 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.130
 rotating fist if I have to make a 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.959
 criticism to the gentlemen of the run is 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.450
 possibly for those of us who have 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.450
 the small hands the size of the 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.900
 points 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.240
 to my way of thinking they are quite big and 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.960
 when you want to access 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.550
 in this case to the brake trigger 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.860
 we are a little away 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:02.070
 we have to approach would be 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:05.070
 It is therefore advisable to have more measures of 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.590
 fists to have that same option 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.740
 to stop the bicycle has opted 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:15.420
 in this case also for the branch in 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:18.150
 aviv xx, avoiding the 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:21.390
 problems that once had loss of 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:25.140
 touch when tightening the handle of the 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:29.190
 firm brake and with the typical power of 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:31.290
 avid with 160 mm discs in 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.660
 both wheels to give life to 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.370
 suspension has been chosen and following the 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:41.170
 sram line 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.950
 rock shox shit workout does not stop 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.819
 surprise us 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.650
 as always the hydraulic lock one 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:50.290
 authentic delight that has already 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.079
 seasons in the market and that still 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:56.500
 has not been surpassed by any of 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:04:00.129
 the competition a linear and soft touch 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:03.069
 from beginning to end that swallows more than 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:07.720
 enough for a pure bicycle 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:11.200
 Rally handlebar power and fixed saddle 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:14.700
 of stupendous invoice in this case of 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:18.000
 the american signature history 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:22.320
 a precious power 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.910
 robust with a handlebar of 71 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.030
 centimeters than with the width 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:30.210
 enough gives us an extraordinary 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:33.030
 manageability of steering a seatpost 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.970
 straight that we liked the way 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:40.530
 to embrace in this case the rails of 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:44.540
 saddle a tundra 2 physicist with rails of 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:48.270
 carbon that for my personal taste is 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:50.850
 extraordinary for its hardness and comfort 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.669
 and when seating the ischium is 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:56.340
 on the saddle gives us an effectiveness 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:05:00.000
 of really outstanding pedaling and 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:03.390
 chapter deserves the wheel in this 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.100
 case of the Swiss dt suisse the 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:08.400
 explayan h 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:12.660
 rc 1250 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:15.150
 carbon ring and the hub so good a 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:18.539
 authentic wonder of engineering in 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:22.470
 this reliable robust Swiss case and a 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:24.660
 rolling infinity will not possibly be the 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:27.630
 lighter but we can say that the 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.910
 rolling is simply exquisite and 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.430
 perfectly accompany all the 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:36.810
 set of this beautiful bicycle 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:41.210
 cross level ere your covers come 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:44.940
 in charge of soft the rock rum in measure 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:47.340
 2.1 I had the network and maybe a little bit 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.500
 flimsy casing but how good he 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.630
 is created is more than enough to 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.880
 a treatment of a rally bike 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:59.330
 and the weight that our garbage has given 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:59.330
 is cross level r plus is d 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:07.270
 nine kilograms 195 grams without pedals 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:09.700
 Once we have put in place 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:12.280
 on the bicycle, just sit down 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.020
 on the saddle what we notice is how 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:18.340
 if we had put in this 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:21.910
 life-long bicycle is comfort 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:24.970
 It makes you want to squeeze the pedals to the fullest 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:30.070
 the cranks to sac because what he asks 

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:32.440
 this r plus of cross is war and war 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:34.840
 is what we have given him manageable 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:38.190
 beginning to end in twisty curves 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:42.010
 upwards down when it becomes 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:44.680
 criadera the way give everything what can 

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:47.919
 give of oneself a rigid bicycle of some 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:50.440
 wheels of 27 and a half inches has been 

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:51.940
 surprising the overall quality of the 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:56.530
 bicycle but it has also 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:58.690
 surprised to roll a fine roll that 

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:00.900
 gives that comfort you have when you put on 

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:04.330
 about the bicycle and that simply 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:07.150
 all that rigidity that the painting has 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:10.419
 just squeeze the cranks has been 

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:13.450
 translated into an immediacy at the time of 

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:15.400
 catapult it forward now 

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:18.169
 it depends on you and especially on 

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:20.779
 pilot our pilot 

00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:24.020
 our friend arriola is an authentic 

00:07:20.779 --> 00:07:27.409
 Formula 1 driver and of course he's going to 

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:30.259
 squeeze this level r plus cross 

00:07:27.409 --> 00:07:33.949
 to its ultimate consequences 

00:07:30.259 --> 00:07:38.020
 we give good faith of it josema source and 

00:07:33.949 --> 00:07:38.020
 see you in a next test mania
