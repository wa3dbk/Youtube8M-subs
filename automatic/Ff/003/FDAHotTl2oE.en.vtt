00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.350 
gonna be interesting
and<00:02:05.290> I<00:02:06.290> can't<00:02:06.920> actually<00:02:07.100> wait<00:02:07.430> I'm<00:02:07.580> hoping<00:02:08.119> as

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
and I can't actually wait I'm hoping as

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.810 
and I can't actually wait I'm hoping as
well<00:02:08.600> I<00:02:08.630> can<00:02:08.960> somehow<00:02:09.740> get<00:02:10.009> my<00:02:10.070> own<00:02:10.310> character

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
well I can somehow get my own character

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.060 
well I can somehow get my own character
copied<00:02:11.810> over<00:02:12.050> but<00:02:12.260> but<00:02:12.560> we'll<00:02:12.740> have<00:02:12.860> to<00:02:12.920> see

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
copied over but but we'll have to see

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.980 
copied over but but we'll have to see
because<00:02:13.370> that<00:02:13.700> would<00:02:13.820> be<00:02:13.850> so<00:02:14.240> much<00:02:14.480> easier<00:02:14.540> if

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
because that would be so much easier if

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.400 
because that would be so much easier if
I<00:02:15.170> could<00:02:15.200> actually<00:02:15.440> do<00:02:15.800> that<00:02:16.010> with<00:02:16.790> a<00:02:17.410> without

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
I could actually do that with a without

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.949 
I could actually do that with a without
having<00:02:18.860> to<00:02:18.980> level<00:02:19.280> everything<00:02:19.430> up<00:02:19.820> again<00:02:19.970> but

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
having to level everything up again but

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.430 
having to level everything up again but
anyway<00:02:21.320> let's<00:02:21.620> go<00:02:21.800> back<00:02:21.980> to<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:23.110> to<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.230> pet

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
anyway let's go back to the to the pet

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.380 
anyway let's go back to the to the pet
pet<00:02:25.370> pets<00:02:26.060> versus<00:02:26.660> pets<00:02:27.970> they<00:02:28.970> don't<00:02:29.209> make

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
pet pets versus pets they don't make

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.690 
pet pets versus pets they don't make

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700
