the blue Hornet it's been in there for
about<00:01:40.369> two<00:01:41.369> weeks<00:01:41.400> now<00:01:41.970> bottom<00:01:44.000> head-to-heads

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
about two weeks now bottom head-to-heads

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.690 
about two weeks now bottom head-to-heads
on<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.479> he's<00:01:45.720> got<00:01:45.899> five<00:01:46.200> now<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:46.950> he's<00:01:47.430> growing

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
on it he's got five now so he's growing

on it he's got five now so he's growing
a<00:01:47.850> lot<00:01:49.939> kryptonite<00:01:50.939> gonna<00:01:51.270> cool<00:01:51.600> not<00:01:52.200> sure

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
a lot kryptonite gonna cool not sure

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.810 
a lot kryptonite gonna cool not sure
what<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.560> one<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.310> think<00:01:53.340> it's<00:01:53.640> like<00:01:53.790> a
