00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.770 

I<00:02:29.349> like<00:02:29.920> that<00:02:30.099> they<00:02:30.280> have<00:02:30.489> the<00:02:30.849> things<00:02:31.540> for

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
I like that they have the things for

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.449 
I like that they have the things for
tightening<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.290> wire<00:02:32.500> on<00:02:32.769> the<00:02:32.890> side<00:02:33.190> rather

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
tightening the wire on the side rather

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.600 
tightening the wire on the side rather
than<00:02:33.670> through<00:02:34.060> these<00:02:34.299> I've<00:02:35.110> had<00:02:35.470> these<00:02:36.220> blocks

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
than through these I've had these blocks

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.550 
than through these I've had these blocks
before<00:02:37.090> that<00:02:37.330> tighten<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:37.780> wire<00:02:37.959> and<00:02:38.349> the

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
before that tighten the wire and the

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.990 
before that tighten the wire and the
fuse<00:02:38.799> through<00:02:39.159> these<00:02:39.370> and<00:02:39.700> then<00:02:39.819> there's

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
fuse through these and then there's

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.390 
fuse through these and then there's
nothing<00:02:40.420> on<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.629> side<00:02:40.840> so<00:02:41.379> that's<00:02:41.980> pretty

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
nothing on the side so that's pretty

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.910 
nothing on the side so that's pretty
nice<00:02:45.180> wish<00:02:46.180> I<00:02:46.299> had<00:02:46.510> some<00:02:46.750> round<00:02:46.989> show<00:02:47.530> love<00:02:47.799> it

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
nice wish I had some round show love it

00:02:47.920 --> 00:03:03.270 
nice wish I had some round show love it
like<00:02:48.129> that<00:02:59.340> that<00:03:00.340> one's<00:03:00.819> just<00:03:01.000> a<00:03:01.450> little<00:03:02.280> fuses

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
like that that one's just a little fuses

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:16.500 
like that that one's just a little fuses
clamping<00:03:12.090> okay<00:03:13.090> so<00:03:13.150> there's<00:03:13.569> a<00:03:13.629> fuse<00:03:13.930> block<00:03:15.510> we

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
clamping okay so there's a fuse block we

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.710 
clamping okay so there's a fuse block we
have<00:03:16.690> zero<00:03:17.290> gauge<00:03:17.590> wire<00:03:19.319> nice<00:03:20.430> pre-installed

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
have zero gauge wire nice pre-installed

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.849 
have zero gauge wire nice pre-installed
ends<00:03:22.720> I<00:03:22.840> like<00:03:23.260> that

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
ends I like that

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:30.509 
ends I like that
that<00:03:24.069> looks<00:03:24.400> clean<00:03:28.440> past<00:03:29.440> my<00:03:29.709> pull<00:03:29.980> test<00:03:30.250> so

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
that looks clean past my pull test so

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:36.030 
that looks clean past my pull test so
that's<00:03:30.819> good<00:03:31.239> and<00:03:33.690> let's<00:03:34.690> see<00:03:34.870> here<00:03:35.230> four

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
that's good and let's see here four

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.330 
that's good and let's see here four
thousand<00:03:37.019> seven<00:03:38.019> hundred<00:03:38.200> and<00:03:38.530> four<00:03:38.859> strand

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
count pretty nice wire um see if I got a

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.159 
count pretty nice wire um see if I got a
piece<00:03:45.700> around<00:03:46.060> of<00:03:46.419> something<00:03:46.780> else<00:03:46.930> to

flexible and that's bending it hard this
stuff<00:04:20.470> is<00:04:20.709> just<00:04:20.739> like<00:04:21.130> nothing<00:04:21.700> to<00:04:21.970> that

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.250

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.920 
unless I have to really really crimped I
get<00:04:29.470> there<00:04:30.150> this<00:04:31.150> is<00:04:31.450> just<00:04:31.630> nice<00:04:32.190> and<00:04:33.930> this

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
get there this is just nice and this

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.820 
get there this is just nice and this
once<00:04:35.170> it's<00:04:35.380> bent<00:04:36.330> tends<00:04:37.330> to<00:04:37.540> stay<00:04:37.780> bent<00:04:38.050> like

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
once it's bent tends to stay bent like

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.900 
once it's bent tends to stay bent like
this<00:04:39.100> which<00:04:39.750> obviously<00:04:40.750> just<00:04:41.230> kind<00:04:41.680> of<00:04:41.910> bends

right<00:04:43.210> back<00:04:48.300> yeah

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.120 

yeah

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:06.160 

this<00:04:59.760> is<00:04:59.910> definitely<00:05:00.330> thicker<00:05:00.750> more<00:05:01.650> strands

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:20.920 

well<00:05:13.790> this<00:05:14.090> is<00:05:14.270> distribution<00:05:14.900> block<00:05:19.930> so

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
well this is distribution block so

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.250 
well this is distribution block so
here's<00:05:21.440> a<00:05:21.500> little<00:05:21.890> connectors<00:05:22.520> granel<00:05:23.420> stage

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260 
here's a little connectors granel stage

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:30.420 
here's a little connectors granel stage

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
actors whatnot remote wire

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.940 
actors whatnot remote wire
decent<00:05:31.430> size<00:05:31.640> remote<00:05:32.060> wire<00:05:32.330> I<00:05:32.690> usually<00:05:33.590> don't

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:33.950 
decent size remote wire I usually don't

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.800 
decent size remote wire I usually don't
use<00:05:34.130> the<00:05:34.550> remote<00:05:34.850> wire<00:05:35.060> that<00:05:35.330> comes<00:05:35.570> with

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
use the remote wire that comes with

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.810 
use the remote wire that comes with
amplifier<00:05:36.380> kits<00:05:36.770> because<00:05:36.950> it's<00:05:37.250> just<00:05:37.460> not<00:05:37.640> big

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
amplifier kits because it's just not big

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:38.950 
amplifier kits because it's just not big
enough<00:05:37.880> to<00:05:38.240> my<00:05:38.330> liking

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
enough to my liking

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:47.530 
enough to my liking
this<00:05:39.800> I'll<00:05:40.010> actually<00:05:40.220> use<00:05:46.090> okay<00:05:47.090> this<00:05:47.330> is<00:05:47.510> a

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:47.540 
this I'll actually use okay this is a

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.090 
this I'll actually use okay this is a
nylon<00:05:47.960> braided<00:05:48.410> stuff<00:05:48.860> they're<00:05:49.070> talking

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:49.100 
nylon braided stuff they're talking

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:54.130 
nylon braided stuff they're talking
about<00:05:50.140> must<00:05:51.140> be<00:05:51.320> the<00:05:51.470> girl<00:05:51.710> like<00:05:52.130> users<00:05:52.870> or<00:05:53.870> the

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:54.140 
about must be the girl like users or the

00:05:54.140 --> 00:06:08.390 
about must be the girl like users or the
part<00:05:54.380> goes<00:05:54.830> on<00:05:55.010> your<00:05:55.280> engine

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.920 

looks<00:06:09.400> like<00:06:09.640> this<00:06:10.060> is<00:06:10.270> the<00:06:10.420> part<00:06:10.630> that<00:06:10.690> would

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:10.930 
looks like this is the part that would

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.870 
looks like this is the part that would
go<00:06:11.080> up<00:06:11.230> in<00:06:11.410> there<00:06:11.590> Asian<00:06:12.190> compartment<00:06:12.790> should

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 
go up in there Asian compartment should

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.900 
go up in there Asian compartment should
be<00:06:13.390> nice<00:06:13.900> and<00:06:14.260> not<00:06:15.160> look<00:06:15.400> like<00:06:15.610> you<00:06:15.760> have<00:06:15.880> a

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:15.910 
be nice and not look like you have a

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:17.510 
be nice and not look like you have a
power<00:06:16.150> one<00:06:16.450> out<00:06:16.660> there

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 
power one out there

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:25.650 
power one out there
Thanks<00:06:18.550> n<00:06:18.730> VX<00:06:19.500> pieces<00:06:20.500> there<00:06:24.150> I'm<00:06:25.150> assuming

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:25.660 
Thanks n VX pieces there I'm assuming

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.000 
Thanks n VX pieces there I'm assuming
that's<00:06:25.810> where<00:06:26.080> they<00:06:26.230> want<00:06:26.410> you<00:06:26.560> to<00:06:26.650> put<00:06:26.860> your

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.010 
that's where they want you to put your

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:36.620 
that's where they want you to put your
fuse<00:06:27.340> just<00:06:27.940> right<00:06:28.660> in<00:06:28.810> between<00:06:28.930> horn<00:06:32.190> like<00:06:34.650> so

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:36.630 
fuse just right in between horn like so

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:39.360 
fuse just right in between horn like so
so<00:06:37.630> you'd<00:06:37.780> have<00:06:37.810> the<00:06:38.050> nd<00:06:38.530> X<00:06:38.650> on<00:06:38.890> both<00:06:38.920> sides

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:39.370 
so you'd have the nd X on both sides

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:45.930 
so you'd have the nd X on both sides
this<00:06:41.400> pretty<00:06:42.400> nice<00:06:42.730> I<00:06:43.000> like<00:06:43.210> that<00:06:44.040> it's<00:06:45.040> very

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:45.940 
this pretty nice I like that it's very

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.730 
this pretty nice I like that it's very
user<00:06:46.300> friendly<00:06:46.450> for<00:06:47.080> someone<00:06:47.380> who<00:06:47.530> doesn't

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:47.740 
user friendly for someone who doesn't

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.180 
user friendly for someone who doesn't
know<00:06:48.010> what<00:06:48.190> they're<00:06:48.340> doing<00:06:48.760> that's<00:06:49.270> for<00:06:49.630> sure

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:50.190

know what they're doing that's for sure
you<00:06:51.190> can<00:06:51.430> test<00:06:52.270> on<00:06:52.540> the<00:06:52.630> edge<00:06:53.160> good<00:06:55.740> yeah

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:56.740 
you can test on the edge good yeah

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:02.540 
you can test on the edge good yeah
that's<00:06:56.980> that's<00:06:57.760> a<00:06:57.970> big<00:06:58.180> heavy<00:06:58.450> piece<00:06:58.840> of<00:06:58.870> water

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.920 

compared<00:07:03.550> to<00:07:03.640> my<00:07:03.760> new<00:07:03.910> concepts<00:07:04.510> I<00:07:04.690> actually

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:04.930 
compared to my new concepts I actually

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:09.360 
compared to my new concepts I actually
like<00:07:05.320> this<00:07:05.560> stuff<00:07:05.860> it's<00:07:06.220> a<00:07:07.650> tad<00:07:08.650> less<00:07:08.919> strain

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:09.370 
like this stuff it's a tad less strain

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:13.560 
like this stuff it's a tad less strain
