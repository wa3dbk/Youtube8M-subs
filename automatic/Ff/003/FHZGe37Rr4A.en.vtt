00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:29.419
 It's JurerÃª, he was born in Vienna, Austria. 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.730
 in 1887 and became one of the scientists 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:34.280
 which contributed most to the 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.780
 development of quantum mechanics its 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.660
 controversial cat hypothesis 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.339
 simultaneously alive and dead was released 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.470
 in 1935 

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:45.410
 two years after he had won the 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:50.869
 fred physics Nobel Prize he passed away 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:53.000
 in 1961 the chu young cat is one of the 

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:53.869
 more bizarre ideas already produced by 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.390
 human mind 

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:59.629
 it is an imaginary experience 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.909
 in which a cat in the role of korba is 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.129
 alive and dead at the same time and not 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:06.320
 We are talking about spiritism, but 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.939
 quantum mechanics is the branch of physics that 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.090
 study the strange world of 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:13.430
 sub-atomic particles the hypothesis was 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.350
 Austrian conceived by one frangueiro 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.250
 of the century's most brilliant scientists 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.140
 20 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.400
 his intention was to show how the 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.490
 particle behavior 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.740
 sub-atomic equations seems logical to 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.630
 easy to see 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.780
 like a cat stuck in a closed box 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.180
 in the situation proposed by him the life of the 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.430
 animal would be at the mercy of 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.190
 radioactive substances if it 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.770
 case the cat would die otherwise he 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.150
 I'd stay alive until then there's nothing 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.850
 too much 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.190
 the story goes crazy even when 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.680
 analyzed according to the laws of the world 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.659
 subatomic analysis according to which both 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.390
 possibilities can happen at the same 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.710
 time leaving the animal simultaneously 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.780
 alive and dead 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.330
 but what if a scientist looked at 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.150
 inside the box he would be nothing 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.909
 more just a live or dead cat 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.130
 This is because according to quantum 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.170
 there was a minimum of interference as 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.780
 a source of light used to observe 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.360
 phenomenon the parallel realities of the 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.790
 subatomic world would collapse and 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.980
 we will only see one of them because of this 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.470
 It is worthwhile to try to 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.150
 practice found it difficult to understand 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.730
 crazy good stuff 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.439
 the best physicists have the same problem 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.150
 this example shows that not yet 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:31.880
 we understand the deeper implications 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.530
 of quantum mechanics 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.510
 where the hypothetical would be made 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.940
 surprising experience contains a 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.250
 container with radioactive material and a 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.160
 gaga counter detector device 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.170
 radiation if this material releases 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.720
 radioactive particles or counter 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.760
 notices its presence and triggers the hammer 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.200
 which in turn breaks the bottle of 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.600
 poison 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.610
 here the cat appears alive because in 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:00.110
 version of reality nothing detected 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:02.090
 by the gaigher counter here the cat comes up 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.670
 dead because in this other version of it 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.650
 instant of time game account detected 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.960
 particle and fired the hammer. 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.960
 poison from the party bottle killed the cat 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.170
 following the rationale of xuri read the 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.480
 two realities will happen 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.760
 simultaneously and the cat would be alive and 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.060
 killed at the same time until the box 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.830
 was open to an observer 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:28.810
 would end the duality he could only 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.810
 see a live cat or a dead cat 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.030
 Bock, that 's it.
