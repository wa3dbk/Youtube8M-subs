00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
initially got a little trial sizes with

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.080 
initially got a little trial sizes with
a<00:00:27.900> gift<00:00:28.170> set<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.859> trial<00:00:29.099> size<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.550> massive

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
a gift set and the trial size is massive

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.150 
a gift set and the trial size is massive
anyways<00:00:30.420> like<00:00:31.109> that<00:00:31.260> big<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:31.679> you<00:00:31.800> only<00:00:31.920> need

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
anyways like that big and you only need

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.639 
anyways like that big and you only need
a<00:00:32.550> tiny<00:00:33.300> bit<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.750> so<00:00:33.840> this<00:00:33.960> lasted<00:00:34.350> me<00:00:34.469> about

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
a tiny bit of it so this lasted me about

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.410 
a tiny bit of it so this lasted me about
for<00:00:35.340> moms<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:37.550> and<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.670> really<00:00:38.940> liked<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.360> and

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
for moms and and I really liked it and

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.630 
for moms and and I really liked it and
it<00:00:40.260> doesn't<00:00:40.469> members<00:00:40.649> can<00:00:40.800> really<00:00:41.010> soft<00:00:41.309> and

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
it doesn't members can really soft and

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.660 
it doesn't members can really soft and
nice<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.239> didn't<00:00:42.960> break<00:00:43.110> me<00:00:43.260> out<00:00:43.320> which

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
nice and didn't break me out which

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.709 
nice and didn't break me out which
moisturizers<00:00:44.670> can<00:00:44.940> tend<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.390> break<00:00:45.510> me<00:00:45.660> out

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
moisturizers can tend to break me out

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.770 
moisturizers can tend to break me out
sometimes<00:00:46.309> so<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.340> thought<00:00:47.730> it's<00:00:48.329> well<00:00:48.570> worth

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
sometimes so I thought it's well worth

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.970 
sometimes so I thought it's well worth
paying<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.289> price<00:00:49.469> tag<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:51.829> it's<00:00:52.829> got<00:00:52.949> a

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
paying the price tag and it's got a

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.029 
paying the price tag and it's got a
really<00:00:53.190> nice<00:00:54.170> smell<00:00:55.170> like<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.440> really<00:00:55.649> soft

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
really nice smell like a really soft

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.819 
really nice smell like a really soft
clean<00:00:56.579> smell<00:00:56.940> with<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.300> hint<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.690> floral<00:00:58.199> but

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
clean smell with a hint of floral but

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.250

sometimes I'll come and the skin is
really<00:01:20.040> red<00:01:20.340> which<00:01:21.140> isn't<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.229> best<00:01:22.380> thing

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530
