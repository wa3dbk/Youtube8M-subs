 gamescollection.it god on your that 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.320
 this is our usual column of 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.310
 last purchases 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.560
 let's start immediately the climate bayonet believe 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.590
 shaun for xbox 60 this is the version 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.239
 Australian pal that came out clearly 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.160
 only in australia 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:35.230
 I don't have this version here 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.780
 purchased but I made an exchange with 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.969
 a user who was here first on the channel 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.960
 he was a member of the forum and he liked it 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:46.960
 Meanwhile invitation to do the same to you 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.620
 we made the exchange and then the 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.990
 I thank 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.900
 I did take it from capital and 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:55.690
 again master I hope I said so 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:01:02.680
 correctly it has been a while since 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:05.619
 2009 but I have not forgotten contains 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.530
 a nice artbook a column cd 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:12.450
 sound is clearly the game then 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:15.189
 continuing purchased are a second 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.990
 in justice collector's edition 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:18.940
 I took it too lectiones eagle a lot 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.430
 I like the game beautiful 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.040
 clearly it is as many say how 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.440
 many write and mortal kombat with le 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.180
 skins of the dc comics characters 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.670
 however, it is always a good game 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:34.150
 then purchased the lego city undercover 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:38.650
 for wii unlimited edition by kids not 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.820
 it's mince dice that lego games 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.330
 they are made really well there you have it 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.229
 played 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.670
 I really think so, oh God, it's not like that 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.220
 lego batman lego the lord of the rings 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.960
 or lego harry potter is a little more 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.299
 childish to tell the truth but it is always 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.979
 fun these games are made 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.970
 very very great inspirations for 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:02:00.280
 the famous funny lego bricks 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.040
 good graphics on you too 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.220
 there are always riddles of truth 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.530
 the story is cute and fun 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:13.900
 in other words, I read another in the challenge of the 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:16.209
 others read at the market this time 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.790
 not that I was fantastic to say the 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.920
 but what the fuck if not that I can 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:25.040
 always find them I play for 5 euros 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:29.239
 in any case, I took little 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:32.810
 the 5 euro usl for fuck winter game 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:35.900
 mortal kombat nilo g very cool should 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.750
 be the third chapter practically 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.269
 brought on nintendo 64 done right 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.760
 well done great game very nice 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:46.209
 a title that very few people 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:52.010
 surely they know only I know 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:54.439
 of the da da zelda dl i never have 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.439
 heard the truth ocarina of time 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:59.720
 fucking zelda ocarina of time is a title 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:00.939
 strafigo is one of the best games 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.349
 adventure 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:06.470
 in short, what the fuck do I tell you do you know 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:08.629
 companies a cool plus another cool 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.959
 but in this case in the field of 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:15.409
 fighting game killer instinct gold always 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:19.189
 5 euro use is a version is a port 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:21.530
 of the version of killer instinct 2 for 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:24.409
 nintendo 64 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.109
 in theory the porting of the 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:29.269
 very first killer istinct 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:31.760
 but then since I was leaving the 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:36.500
 nintendo 64 then called inter alia 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:38.389
 ultra 64 then decided to wait for them 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.319
 they are about to port on nintendo 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:44.750
 64 and to do another super porting 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:47.930
 nintendo of who the rhythmics are now 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:50.629
 become history i bought resident 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.699
 of the 2 for Nintendo 64 an ambitious 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:55.310
 porting of the output version to 

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:57.349
 playstation is done quite well 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.169
 despite the backdrops are 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:02.870
 actually we say photography 

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:06.019
 instead of real backdrops in 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:10.939
 like 3d clearly respecting i 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:11.329
 canonical methods they used in those 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:13.159
 times 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:16.190
 anyway it's a port is enough 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:19.940
 decent version for nintendo 64 yes 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:23.750
 found about 50 60 euros and I did that 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:26.389
 take it and for better ex beckstrom that 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:29.389
 it's kind of an unofficial necklace 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:32.240
 which collects many games released for the 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:33.229
 back tex here I count about 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.720
 about thirty 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:39.210
 there are almost all the titles I believe and 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.310
 in theory it is an unofficial version 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.790
 just as for fact workers I do 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:47.400
 see what is actually inside 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:50.610
 this pack practically a chip 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:53.840
 with two circuits retyping changed le 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:57.420
 positions of these tiny feet 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.640
 you can change the game it was 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:02.340
 closed practically all this inside 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:05.010
 single chip or is ready if we want to go 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.110
 specifically I wanted to take in 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.630
 actually normal games then 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.220
 actually made to cost they cost 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.260
 a lot because they are very difficult to 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.290
 find 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:18.270
 so to say let's start getting into it 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:21.150
 in the world of death race even if it already is 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:23.580
 I knew I did take this 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:26.700
 unofficial necklace that you do anyway 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:29.669
 finds on 40 euros counting that with 40 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:33.320
 I would have bought one maybe maybe two 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:35.520
 box games to whom and complete and therefore 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.680
 first of testers or later those who do 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:41.550
 liked more definitely i will buy them 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:44.370
 in a steelbook physical version of bioshock 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:47.190
 endless that I wanted this I had to 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:50.100
 break the balls to my games 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:51.390
 of trust to find me 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.580
 in fact I only took it now 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:56.540
 despite and the game is already finished but 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:59.010
 cute anyway free 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.440
 ok video a little short this month 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:03.960
 but then close it up enough 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:07.620
 beauty with an object I was looking for from 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:11.160
 a lot of time also because I had you 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:13.320
 said I have a private game room no 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.200
 maybe I didn't tell you 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:18.419
 okay this is my last purchase 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:21.260
