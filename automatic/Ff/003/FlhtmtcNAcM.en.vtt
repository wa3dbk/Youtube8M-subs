00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
so I get lots of screen space over here

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.500 
so I get lots of screen space over here
it<00:00:34.890> really<00:00:35.399> looks<00:00:35.670> running<00:00:36.120> into<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.329> door

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
here so it's a really nice setup and I

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.850 
here so it's a really nice setup and I
like<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:38.760> thing<00:00:39.450> is<00:00:39.480> sitting<00:00:40.290> down<00:00:40.410> all<00:00:40.770> the

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
like it thing is sitting down all the

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.520 
like it thing is sitting down all the
time<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.399> not<00:00:41.550> necessarily<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.450> best<00:00:42.750> idea<00:00:43.379> in

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
time is not necessarily the best idea in

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.799 
time is not necessarily the best idea in
the<00:00:43.620> world<00:00:43.649> which<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.250> why<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.910> went<00:00:45.420> over<00:00:45.690> to

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
the world which is why I went over to

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.380 
the world which is why I went over to
this<00:00:46.280> but<00:00:47.280> my<00:00:47.430> other<00:00:47.579> computer<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.090> a<00:00:48.120> laptop

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
this but my other computer is a laptop

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.959 
this but my other computer is a laptop
was<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:48.960> 15<00:00:49.320> inch<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.860> know<00:00:49.950> MacBook<00:00:50.430> Pro<00:00:50.640> here

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
was a 15 inch you know MacBook Pro here

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.889 
was a 15 inch you know MacBook Pro here
so<00:00:51.300> how<00:00:51.449> do<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.629> get<00:00:51.809> two<00:00:52.140> screens<00:00:53.600> attached<00:00:54.600> to

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
so how do I get two screens attached to

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.330 
so how do I get two screens attached to
it<00:00:55.050> so<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.199> don't<00:00:55.469> feel<00:00:55.680> like<00:00:55.739> I'm<00:00:56.100> sacrificing

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
it so I don't feel like I'm sacrificing

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.240 
it so I don't feel like I'm sacrificing
too<00:00:57.210> much<00:00:57.449> screen<00:00:57.809> space<00:00:58.109> well<00:00:59.010> what<00:00:59.160> I've

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
too much screen space well what I've

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.569 
too much screen space well what I've
done<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.850> I<00:00:59.969> went<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.449> bought<00:01:00.690> one<00:01:01.250> of<00:01:02.250> these

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
done is I went and bought one of these

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.350 
done is I went and bought one of these
so<00:01:03.480> matrix<00:01:04.080> duo<00:01:04.710> head<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.430> go<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.790> can<00:01:06.210> see

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
so matrix duo head to go you can see

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.020 
so matrix duo head to go you can see
there<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.930> has<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.320> digital<00:01:07.680> em<00:01:08.130> eversion

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
there it has a digital em eversion

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.090 
there it has a digital em eversion
hopefully<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.689> can<00:01:09.840> see<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.229> which<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.070> think

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
hopefully you can see that which I think

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.399 
hopefully you can see that which I think
stands<00:01:11.490> for<00:01:11.700> Mac<00:01:11.970> Edition<00:01:12.180> but<00:01:13.049> it's<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.200> little

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
stands for Mac Edition but it's a little

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.990 
stands for Mac Edition but it's a little
tiny<00:01:13.619> box<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.100> can<00:01:14.250> see<00:01:14.369> it's<00:01:14.490> not<00:01:14.580> very<00:01:14.790> big

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
tiny box you can see it's not very big

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.270 
tiny box you can see it's not very big
according<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.479> my<00:01:15.600> hand<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:16.259> attaches<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.189> the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
according to my hand it attaches to the

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.910 
according to my hand it attaches to the
macbook<00:01:17.610> pro<00:01:17.820> via<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.390> built-in<00:01:18.920> display

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
macbook pro via the built-in display

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.630 
macbook pro via the built-in display
port<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.460> USB<00:01:21.060> for<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.869> power<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:23.159> powers

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
port and USB for the power and it powers

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.140 
port and USB for the power and it powers
these<00:01:23.909> two<00:01:24.240> big<00:01:24.600> monitors<00:01:25.580> now<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.640> one<00:01:26.880> thing

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
these two big monitors now the one thing

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.270 
these two big monitors now the one thing
that<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.720> interesting<00:01:28.020> about<00:01:28.439> this<00:01:28.799> thing<00:01:29.040> is

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
that is interesting about this thing is

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.390 
that is interesting about this thing is
that<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.640> does<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.630> when<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.369> maximize<00:01:32.369> a

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
that it does the when you maximize a

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.580 
that it does the when you maximize a
window<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:33.210> basically<00:01:33.600> tries<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:34.079> go<00:01:34.200> over<00:01:34.409> to

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
window it basically tries to go over to

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.230 
window it basically tries to go over to
screen<00:01:34.950> so<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.220> basically<00:01:35.340> takes<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.060> two

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
screen so it basically takes the two

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.200 
screen so it basically takes the two
screens<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.900> acts<00:01:37.380> like<00:01:37.799> it's<00:01:38.070> one<00:01:38.430> screen<00:01:38.909> so

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
screens and acts like it's one screen so

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.760 
screens and acts like it's one screen so
it's<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.420> little<00:01:39.600> bit<00:01:39.810> interesting<00:01:40.439> in<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.650> way

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
it's a little bit interesting in the way

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.740 
it's a little bit interesting in the way
that<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.070> does<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.240> really<00:01:42.600> don't

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
that it does that so you really don't

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.200 
that it does that so you really don't
maximize<00:01:43.170> windows<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.310> just<00:01:44.490> kind<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.759> drag

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
maximize windows you just kind of drag

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.389 
maximize windows you just kind of drag
it<00:01:45.390> around<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.780> they're<00:01:45.930> big<00:01:46.170> but<00:01:46.470> still<00:01:46.770> being

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
it around to they're big but still being

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.920 
it around to they're big but still being
