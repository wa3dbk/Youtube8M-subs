00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.300
 hello everyone I'm bringing the hack in 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.450
 black ops 2 in zombies on the map 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.670
 transit and good we are concretely in 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.740
 survival mode ok we're in mode 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.660
 Survival you know how good that 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.820
 when you shoot the first time it is activated 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.680
 what is the patch or the hack or the 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.180
 mochos as you want to call it and well we 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.460
 gives a million points because as you can see 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.770
 I could go out without killing any zombies 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.430
 and be able to buy what you want but 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.720
 well I do not come to teach rounds or anything 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.970
 is here in survival not much 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.670
 less good as you know we have the super 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.140
 jump is worth but infinite ammunition but 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.880
 put weapons 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.620
 there is no fog as you are seeing 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.690
 sun and fog here in this part of here 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.000
 what would be the separation with the seen 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.739
 already left the map I'm out of the 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.630
 map in what would be in the mode 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.790
 survival and good is now sounding 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.879
 a laugh off the map is worth it because 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.710
 suppose that if we did normal 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.270
 ok if we did not have the patch then 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.280
 we would be dead new here no no 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.950
 we can go wrong in all this pieces 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.660
 we would be dead but good what 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.950
 I come to show and I taught it recently 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.110
 in a streaming but for those who 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.790
 you lost the good streaming so that 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.400
 see it a little here 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.500
 better in hd we should refer that the 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.600
 streaming you know it's not on hd and 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.580
 good and what you are going to see is going to be 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.410
 paranoia for the map is worth it because 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.390
 supposes that we are in survival mode 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.580
 right now at the station and how are you 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.310
 seeing we can go to town for example and 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.130
 open the bank and as you are seeing is 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.890
 full of failures we did not say that is 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.020
 see transparent walls there are things that 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.670
 the door is not worth logically here 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.200
 it did not open but as you can see the 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.870
 outside of the map especially on the outside 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.430
 many paranoia are based are worth the 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.680
 posters have disappeared all 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.360
 crystals do not break I do not know here as 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.009
 You are looking at the bar poster 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.990
 it is right now you see some squares 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.910
 rare and good we can open we can 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.580
 enter and explore a bit what is the 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.920
 map and a little see the madness that you 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.509
 enter the game not here as you see is not 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.060
 the pool table are not only the 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:14.239
 blood stains are neither the nor the 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.010
 table or anything and it was basically good for 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.690
 show a little the paranoia is there is no 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.120
 they are not on the posters as you see 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.489
 of the motel or the bowling or anything and there 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.060
 doors that are open and things like that 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:27.069
 no and well what are you going to see this as 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.379
 I already say is the superior mode 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.510
 at the station why at the station 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:33.609
 the beginning was fine and the rest is 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.129
 everything like that with paranoia is not the map 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:39.579
 complete of transit is worth but as 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:41.439
 I say it's super weird and good and you go to 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:44.500
 see a little what are the areas more like this 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:45.939
 more curious not of things that are missing as 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.769
 here for example missing the door to 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:49.900
 the laundry now you will see another door 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:52.060
 missing from back also bad and things 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.579
 well and good what will be the end of the 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.769
 video you will see what is the station 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:59.709
 with social paranoia, that is, I made another 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.090
 departure on the map here of village vale 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.469
 in survival and I left the map 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.060
 village and I went to the station to 

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:05.290
 that comes is also the station the 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.469
 paranoia that he does when we play in 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.629
 People in survival are surely worth 

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:12.970
 I will also show some more mode already 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:14.980
 I showed this in a streaming but good 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.570
 and I'll show it so that he just lost and 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.100
 little better so I'm going to leave 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.300
 with the rest of the video I hope that you 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.770
 like it and if you like to vote I like it 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.910
 favorites and see you in the next 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.910
