00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
basketball turnovers on the road can

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.720 
basketball turnovers on the road can
cost<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.660> giving<00:00:31.470> teams<00:00:31.679> extra<00:00:32.189> possessions

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
to take care of basketball I thought

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.260 
to take care of basketball I thought
that<00:00:37.770> was<00:00:37.890> key<00:00:38.190> for<00:00:38.219> us<00:00:38.579> especially<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.180> way

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
that was key for us especially the way

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.110 
that was key for us especially the way
we<00:00:39.300> set<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.899> tone<00:00:40.140> early<00:00:40.410> on<00:00:40.739> by<00:00:41.399> executing<00:00:41.940> on

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
we set the tone early on by executing on

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.030 
we set the tone early on by executing on
the<00:00:42.210> offensive<00:00:42.690> end<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:43.350> seen<00:00:43.649> your<00:00:43.800> coach

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
the offensive end you seen your coach

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.650

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
she needs bulletin board material but

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.940 
she needs bulletin board material but
the<00:00:45.780> fact<00:00:46.020> that<00:00:46.110> they<00:00:46.260> did<00:00:46.469> say<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.739> don't

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
the fact that they did say you don't

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.100 
the fact that they did say you don't
like<00:00:47.039> contact<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:48.149> played<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.390> role<00:00:48.480> right<00:00:48.780> I

understandable there's nothing against

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.149 
understandable there's nothing against
him<00:01:28.979> because<00:01:29.610> like<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:29.970> said<00:01:30.140> he<00:01:31.140> was<00:01:31.350> right<00:01:31.590> if

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
him because like I said he was right if

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.340 
him because like I said he was right if
he<00:01:32.400> was<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.579> year<00:01:32.880> earlier<00:01:33.180> he<00:01:33.659> was<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.840> hundred

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
he was a year earlier he was a hundred

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.410 
he was a year earlier he was a hundred
percent<00:01:34.439> on<00:01:34.829> point<00:01:35.130> I'd<00:01:35.700> have<00:01:35.850> never<00:01:35.939> said<00:01:36.270> it

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
percent on point I'd have never said it

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.350 
percent on point I'd have never said it
but<00:01:37.350> he<00:01:37.710> was<00:01:37.890> right<00:01:38.150> we're<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.180> different

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
but he was right we're a different

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.679 
but he was right we're a different
basketball<00:01:39.990> team<00:01:40.310> and<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.939> think<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.450> shows

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
basketball team and I think it shows

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.770 
basketball team and I think it shows
when<00:01:42.960> you're<00:01:43.079> able<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.439> go<00:01:43.590> out<00:01:43.770> on<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.040> road

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
when you're able to go out on the road

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.870 
when you're able to go out on the road
against<00:01:45.780> good<00:01:45.930> teams<00:01:46.140> compete<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:46.979> get

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
against good teams compete and get

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.080 
against good teams compete and get
