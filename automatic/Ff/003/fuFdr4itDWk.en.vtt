00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
but the inspiration really came from an

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.940 
but the inspiration really came from an

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
about the nature of creativity he said

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.310

in<00:00:43.950> effect<00:00:44.309> that<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.910> key<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.180> his<00:00:45.690> creativity

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
in effect that the key to his creativity

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.520 
in effect that the key to his creativity
is<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:47.160> make<00:00:47.399> something<00:00:47.730> every<00:00:48.629> day<00:00:48.660> I've

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
is to make something every day I've

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.619 
is to make something every day I've
always<00:00:49.800> had<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.070> sneaking<00:00:50.460> suspicion<00:00:50.700> this

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
always had a sneaking suspicion this

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.049 
always had a sneaking suspicion this
might<00:00:51.930> be<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.140> good<00:00:52.410> idea<00:00:52.469> in<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.760> creative

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
might be a good idea in the creative

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.330 
might be a good idea in the creative
projects<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.780> I've<00:00:54.930> done<00:00:55.260> in<00:00:55.410> my<00:00:55.440> time<00:00:55.920> I've

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
projects that I've done in my time I've

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.700 
projects that I've done in my time I've
always<00:00:56.670> found<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.629> if<00:00:57.930> i<00:00:58.230> could<00:00:58.410> get<00:00:58.530> the

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
always found that if i could get the

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.860 
always found that if i could get the
ball<00:00:58.739> rolling<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.670> creativity<00:01:00.180> always

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
ball rolling the creativity always

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.360 
ball rolling the creativity always
seemed<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.140> sort<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.590> just<00:01:01.800> take<00:01:02.010> care<00:01:02.039> of

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
seemed to sort of just take care of

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.840 
seemed to sort of just take care of
itself<00:01:02.550> but<00:01:03.149> when<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.420> ball<00:01:03.719> isn't<00:01:04.049> rolling

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
itself but when that ball isn't rolling

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.390 
itself but when that ball isn't rolling
creativity<00:01:05.850> can<00:01:06.210> often<00:01:06.600> feel<00:01:06.869> like<00:01:07.229> hell<00:01:08.070> or

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
creativity can often feel like hell or

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.560 
creativity can often feel like hell or
terror<00:01:09.390> or<00:01:10.490> something<00:01:11.490> worse<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.540> feel

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
terror or something worse and I feel

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.539 
terror or something worse and I feel
like<00:01:12.780> I've<00:01:13.080> been<00:01:13.110> succumbing<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.890> this<00:01:14.189> terror

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
like I've been succumbing to this terror

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.640 
like I've been succumbing to this terror
for<00:01:14.970> just<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.450> little<00:01:15.630> bit<00:01:15.750> too<00:01:16.140> long<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.619> think

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
for just a little bit too long I think

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.460 
for just a little bit too long I think
that<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.250> commitment<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.390> just<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.110> kick<00:01:19.320> in

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
that this commitment is just the kick in

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.800 
that this commitment is just the kick in
the<00:01:19.500> ass<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.189> need<00:01:20.460> even<00:01:21.330> as<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:21.540> start

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
the ass that I need even as I start

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.480 
the ass that I need even as I start
making<00:01:22.020> this<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.710> doesn't<00:01:23.070> really<00:01:23.130> feel<00:01:23.430> that

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
making this it doesn't really feel that

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.880 
making this it doesn't really feel that
hard<00:01:23.970> but<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.509> idea<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:24.960> doing<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.770> be

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
hard but the idea of doing it to be

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.370 
hard but the idea of doing it to be
honest<00:01:26.250> with<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.700> seemed<00:01:27.540> like<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:28.170> would<00:01:28.320> be

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
honest with you seemed like it would be

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.640 
honest with you seemed like it would be
a<00:01:28.530> lot<00:01:28.890> more<00:01:28.920> daunting<00:01:29.400> than<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.689> is<00:01:30.900> even

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
a lot more daunting than it is even

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.990 
a lot more daunting than it is even
right<00:01:31.890> now<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.130> kind<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.579> feel<00:01:32.700> like<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:32.939> could

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
right now I kind of feel like I could

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.660 
right now I kind of feel like I could
just<00:01:33.270> be<00:01:33.420> up<00:01:33.570> all<00:01:33.750> night<00:01:33.960> doing<00:01:34.259> this<00:01:34.650> making<00:01:35.579> a

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
just be up all night doing this making a

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.280 
just be up all night doing this making a
new<00:01:35.820> project<00:01:36.329> may<00:01:36.450> be<00:01:36.509> drawing<00:01:36.930> maybe

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
new project may be drawing maybe

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.440 
new project may be drawing maybe
learning<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.920> piano<00:01:38.100> so<00:01:38.850> i<00:01:38.880> guess<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.299> can

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
learning the piano so i guess you can

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.330 
learning the piano so i guess you can
expect<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:40.020> be<00:01:40.259> seeing<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.650> lot<00:01:40.680> more<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:41.189> me

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
expect to be seeing a lot more of me

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.460 
expect to be seeing a lot more of me
