00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.180
 our chat today about halitosis 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.980
 in dogs 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.840
 We'll take advantage of the fact that Adrian is 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.400
 here today you came to us to try 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.449
 solve the problem that the pearl is 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.840
 happening now 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:22.760
 adriana welcome I wanted to thank 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.310
 ask since when did the 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.820
 realize that the stone had a problem 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.190
 of halitosis and fec year attracts 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:35.329
 When did you try to do something? 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:38.359
 You have to brush her tooth once, right? 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.039
 I can tell you that halitosis 

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:42.979
 in fact it is indicative of some 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:45.979
 disease that the little dog of this 

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:47.899
 gingival diseases stomach diseases 

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:48.710
 can lead to this type of 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.829
 problem 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.109
 Ok, we'll try to do with 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.209
 that the pearl has a healthy habit with 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:58.489
 some recommendations come first 

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:59.809
 daily brushing we have to 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.429
 remember that just as we brush 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.530
 three times a day at least 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:05.900
 The precise coding brush does not need 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.870
 both at least once a day have 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.840
 need to brush there are pn products in the 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.580
 market today that you can use 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.220
 there is even mouthwash you 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.340
 places in the drinking water that facilitates 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.530
 withdrawal of this tartar causes the 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.930
 plaque is bacterial plaque 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.540
 on teeth that caused bad breath 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:30.550
 and there are also situations of 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.810
 taxonomy which are procedures 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.760
 procedures with the use of 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.600
 ultrasound and appliance already has 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.260
 can be to take the issue of anesthesia 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.260
 animal 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.060
 With all this we try to do with 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.940
 that he has a healthy habit 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.370
 at some point are you come to 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:53.810
 feed your dog with wet feed does not 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:57.290
 It's only 30 there, as I said exactly 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.360
 use of food is home-based yet 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:03.020
 plus a bad breath problem 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.600
 're always dry feed and preferably 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:09.080
 person because it does not go with the house 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.510
 so much plaque aggregation in the teeth 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.150
 when you give a wet reason 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.709
 never her tool in the mouth so this 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.930
 makes the animal worse off 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.569
 breath we can still use 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.180
 also some homemade recipes not so 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:27.140
 as is the juice of 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:31.700
 beet him he neutralizes this ph 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:34.129
 of mouth is mint boots drops of 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.739
 the use of 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:40.489
 toast when you give a dry toast 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:43.459
 your dog tooth is sanded there is a 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:46.010
 an abrasion residing on that plate also 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.859
 then leaves it all then we try to see 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.510

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:51.590

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.030
 this problem 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.030
 from now on you will start to 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:59.540
 to make a ring to treat water 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.470
 the pick is the exchange surely're 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.819
