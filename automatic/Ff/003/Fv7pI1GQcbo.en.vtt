00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.190
 Hello everyone and welcome to this new one 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.840
 video 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.359
 today we will see how to solve this 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.949
 battery inconvenience 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.859
 of the habitat hours that unfortunately later 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.320
 some time it is no longer possible to 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.560
 recharge and then or would go 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.199
 replaced as in this case 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.450
 it is difficult to find for a while a 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.270
 casino to replace it 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.660
 I decided to change the screwdriver in 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.810
 so you can use it over the counter and 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.420
 so we will attach a cable of this 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.280
 type with clamps on one side 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.810
 connect it to tell the battery all 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.260
 power supply on the right 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:54.120
 on the other side of the simple 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.880
 uncovered icards who are going to do 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.800
 contact where previously he was in contact 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.650
 battery 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:05.450
 therefore we trust 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:09.070
 the two ends of the destiny of the two contacts 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:11.350
 maybe we press the levers with pliers 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.120
 tabs that pop out so that 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.160
 they hold a prize without wishing we can 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.410
 put a drop of pond from the train is 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.650
 I stop everything if we prefer 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.620
 open this part so you can then 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.090
 to make a knot is to stop the cable 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:30.800
 inside so that it does not come off 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:34.369
 maybe even as a result a rip 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.979
 of the wire does not come loose from the contacts e 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.810
 so keep working 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.660
 and here we are finished now 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.119
 we can find with the right with the 12 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.910
 volt this hours habitat was fed to 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:50.900
 9.6 so today it turns even more 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:54.619
 and even more powerful we can hear that 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.840
 it runs very well even under stress not 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:00.320
 has no problem indeed it works 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:05.030
 too well towards has a lot of power e 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:09.190
 comfortable with either the tx3 counter or 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:12.530
 we can connect it to a battery 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.120
 so here too we see the community of 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.190
 common with being able to carry it where not 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.110
 there is current or even putting ourselves 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.970
 I took the cigarette lighter plug it in 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.500
 also there is no safe machine or 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.630
 also directly to the battery from the 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.480
 car in case of emergency if maybe 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.540
 we need it on the road or in a place that 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.910
 there is 220 in this video ended 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.160
 if you have any questions you can do it in 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.350
