00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
we will be doing a really cool piston

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.210 
we will be doing a really cool piston
door<00:00:06.509> so<00:00:06.990> now<00:00:07.170> if<00:00:07.350> we<00:00:07.440> look<00:00:07.500> at<00:00:07.740> this<00:00:07.919> floor

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
door so now if we look at this floor

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.459 
door so now if we look at this floor
looks<00:00:08.460> pretty<00:00:08.760> boring<00:00:09.330> just<00:00:09.690> kind<00:00:09.990> of<00:00:10.080> flat

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
looks pretty boring just kind of flat

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.290 
looks pretty boring just kind of flat
floor<00:00:10.830> nothing<00:00:11.250> special<00:00:11.519> about<00:00:11.759> it<00:00:11.880> but<00:00:12.179> when

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
floor nothing special about it but when

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.189 
floor nothing special about it but when
you<00:00:12.389> hit<00:00:12.570> this<00:00:12.719> lever<00:00:14.120> back<00:00:15.120> so<00:00:15.690> perfect

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
you hit this lever back so perfect

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.880 
you hit this lever back so perfect
piston<00:00:16.619> staircase<00:00:17.160> going<00:00:17.490> right<00:00:17.820> down<00:00:17.850> below

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
piston staircase going right down below

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.630 
piston staircase going right down below
so<00:00:19.890> this<00:00:20.580> is<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.789> great<00:00:21.000> way<00:00:21.119> if<00:00:21.270> your<00:00:21.570> wall<00:00:21.930> is

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
so this is a great way if your wall is

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.320 
so this is a great way if your wall is
completely<00:00:23.640> covered<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:24.060> you're<00:00:24.210> looking

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
completely covered and you're looking

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.929 
completely covered and you're looking
for<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.689> way<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:24.869> get<00:00:25.350> more<00:00:25.529> room<00:00:25.800> go<00:00:26.580> into<00:00:26.820> the

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
for a way to get more room go into the

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.849 
for a way to get more room go into the
floor<00:00:27.710> closes<00:00:28.710> up<00:00:28.859> nice<00:00:30.140> this<00:00:31.140> is<00:00:31.199> actually<00:00:31.470> my

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
floor closes up nice this is actually my

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.010 
floor closes up nice this is actually my
third<00:00:32.189> version<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.270> this<00:00:33.360> floor<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.780> it's<00:00:33.870> by

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
third version of this floor and it's by

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.220 
third version of this floor and it's by
far<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.320> simplest<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.340> most<00:00:35.399> compact

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
far the simplest and most compact

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.229 
far the simplest and most compact
efficient<00:00:37.230> version<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:37.920> I've<00:00:38.070> made<00:00:38.309> so

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
efficient version of it I've made so

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.060 
efficient version of it I've made so
talking<00:00:39.750> about<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.140> wiring<00:00:40.530> we've<00:00:40.710> got<00:00:40.920> our

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
talking about the wiring we've got our

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.479 
talking about the wiring we've got our
basic<00:00:41.790> abb<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.510> switch<00:00:43.050> right<00:00:43.290> here<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.739> if<00:00:44.370> you

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
basic abb a switch right here and if you

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.010 
basic abb a switch right here and if you
don't<00:00:44.670> know<00:00:44.760> what<00:00:44.910> that<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.690> look

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
don't know what that it that is look

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.350 
don't know what that it that is look
more<00:00:46.289> look<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:47.100> up<00:00:47.190> on<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.670> wiki<00:00:48.030> there's

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
more look it up on the wiki there's

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.020 
more look it up on the wiki there's
other<00:00:48.870> places<00:00:49.140> like<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.850> basically<00:00:50.850> what<00:00:51.000> it

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
other places like that basically what it

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.090 
other places like that basically what it
does<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.539> makes<00:00:51.570> this<00:00:51.870> side<00:00:52.140> go<00:00:52.680> on<00:00:52.860> first

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
does is it makes this side go on first

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.160 
does is it makes this side go on first
that's<00:00:53.789> why<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.000> go<00:00:54.149> on<00:00:54.300> second<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:54.840> this<00:00:54.960> side

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
that's why I go on second and this side

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.840 
that's why I go on second and this side
turn<00:00:55.350> offers<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.010> that's<00:00:56.160> I'd<00:00:56.340> turn<00:00:56.699> off

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
turn offers and that's I'd turn off

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.790 
turn offers and that's I'd turn off
second<00:00:57.649> so<00:00:58.649> we've<00:00:59.430> got<00:00:59.670> two<00:01:00.600> sides<00:01:00.989> here<00:01:01.320> we've

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
second so we've got two sides here we've

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.460 
second so we've got two sides here we've
got<00:01:01.829> this<00:01:02.280> side<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:02.820> pulls<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.110> floor

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
got this side and this pulls the floor

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.460 
got this side and this pulls the floor
down<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.100> then<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:06.000> pulls<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.840> into<00:01:06.960> here<00:01:07.260> for

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
down and then it pulls it into here for

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.800 
down and then it pulls it into here for
storage<00:01:07.740> leaving<00:01:08.700> space<00:01:09.000> on<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.299> top<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.720> in

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
storage leaving space on the top and in

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.109 
storage leaving space on the top and in
this<00:01:09.930> side<00:01:10.200> pushes<00:01:10.619> stairs<00:01:10.979> in<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:12.000> then

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
this side pushes stairs in and then

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.510 
this side pushes stairs in and then
pushes<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.630> stairs<00:01:12.930> up<00:01:13.170> into<00:01:13.470> place<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:14.340> let's

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
pushes the stairs up into place so let's

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:23.490 
pushes the stairs up into place so let's
watch

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.610 

so<00:01:24.130> you<00:01:24.220> can<00:01:24.460> see<00:01:24.640> that<00:01:24.670> the<00:01:24.850> Pistons<00:01:25.620> pulled

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.620 
so you can see that the Pistons pulled

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.800 
so you can see that the Pistons pulled
and<00:01:27.310> store<00:01:27.700> them<00:01:27.760> in<00:01:27.910> the<00:01:27.970> side<00:01:28.240> and<00:01:28.480> these

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
and store them in the side and these

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.170 
and store them in the side and these
fishings<00:01:29.230> push<00:01:29.560> out<00:01:29.800> and<00:01:30.100> put<00:01:30.520> the<00:01:30.700> stairs<00:01:30.940> on

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
fishings push out and put the stairs on

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.780 
fishings push out and put the stairs on
making<00:01:32.050> it<00:01:32.170> as<00:01:32.290> a<00:01:32.350> lot<00:01:32.620> easier<00:01:32.920> since<00:01:33.610> I've

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
making it as a lot easier since I've

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.440 
making it as a lot easier since I've
made<00:01:34.000> this<00:01:34.180> new<00:01:34.390> version<00:01:34.540> of<00:01:34.870> it<00:01:34.990> so<00:01:35.830> to<00:01:35.920> start

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
made this new version of it so to start

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.560 
made this new version of it so to start
we're<00:01:37.450> going<00:01:37.600> to<00:01:37.660> want<00:01:37.840> to<00:01:37.930> make<00:01:38.080> a<00:01:38.110> 2<00:01:38.500> by<00:01:38.680> 3

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
we're going to want to make a 2 by 3

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.980 
we're going to want to make a 2 by 3
piston<00:01:40.570> wall<00:01:40.810> 3<00:01:41.500> by<00:01:41.530> 2<00:01:41.710> whatever<00:01:42.220> you<00:01:42.340> want<00:01:42.990> and

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
piston wall 3 by 2 whatever you want and

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.260 
piston wall 3 by 2 whatever you want and
then<00:01:44.070> we're<00:01:45.070> going<00:01:45.160> to<00:01:45.220> want<00:01:45.400> to<00:01:45.460> put<00:01:45.640> three

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
then we're going to want to put three

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.740 
then we're going to want to put three
Pistons<00:01:46.690> facing<00:01:47.200> up<00:01:47.350> on<00:01:47.650> the<00:01:48.430> bottom<00:01:49.330> piston

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
Pistons facing up on the bottom piston

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:50.969 
Pistons facing up on the bottom piston
there<00:01:49.930> and<00:01:50.260> we're<00:01:50.410> going<00:01:50.500> to<00:01:50.560> want<00:01:50.740> to<00:01:50.800> put

there and we're going to want to put

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:52.560 
there and we're going to want to put
three<00:01:51.220> blocks<00:01:51.490> of<00:01:51.670> your<00:01:51.790> choice<00:01:52.030> on<00:01:52.210> top<00:01:52.390> of

that this will be your basic this is
what's<00:01:56.410> going<00:01:56.560> to<00:01:56.619> push<00:01:56.979> out<00:01:57.250> and<00:01:57.490> up<00:01:58.240> into<00:01:58.450> the

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
what's going to push out and up into the

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.550 
what's going to push out and up into the
floor<00:01:58.960> and<00:01:59.440> the<00:01:59.560> wire<00:01:59.770> this<00:01:59.979> is<00:02:00.040> fairly<00:02:00.670> simple

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
floor and the wire this is fairly simple

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.510 
floor and the wire this is fairly simple
same<00:02:02.560> one<00:02:02.770> as<00:02:03.040> I<00:02:03.160> used<00:02:03.399> on<00:02:03.640> my<00:02:04.509> floating<00:02:04.840> house

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
same one as I used on my floating house

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.690 
same one as I used on my floating house
video<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:08.380> wires<00:02:08.619> just<00:02:08.920> like<00:02:09.130> that<00:02:09.369> and

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
video the wires just like that and

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.020 
video the wires just like that and
you're<00:02:09.850> set

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
you're set

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.170 
you're set
hey<00:02:12.630> now<00:02:13.620> for<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.980> other<00:02:14.040> side<00:02:14.370> we're<00:02:15.090> going

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
hey now for the other side we're going

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.790 
hey now for the other side we're going
to<00:02:15.270> want<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.540> go<00:02:15.690> right<00:02:16.020> from<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.410> middle<00:02:16.560> we

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
to want to go right from the middle we

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.160 
to want to go right from the middle we
want<00:02:17.010> one<00:02:17.520> pissing<00:02:17.910> on<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.150> floor<00:02:18.180> on<00:02:19.110> the

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
want one pissing on the floor on the

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.260 
want one pissing on the floor on the
ground<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:19.800> then<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.700> second<00:02:21.030> one<00:02:21.060> we're

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
ground and then the second one we're

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.530 
ground and then the second one we're
going<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:21.450> want<00:02:21.630> one<00:02:21.900> pissing<00:02:22.380> in<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:23.580> air<00:02:23.730> to

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
going to want one pissing in the air to

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.840 
going to want one pissing in the air to
up<00:02:24.720> and<00:02:25.680> those<00:02:25.830> that's<00:02:26.130> where<00:02:26.340> our<00:02:26.459> stairs<00:02:26.700> are

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
up and those that's where our stairs are

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.700 
up and those that's where our stairs are
going<00:02:27.000> to<00:02:27.060> be

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.830 

wiring<00:02:30.580> it<00:02:30.730> is<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.180> same<00:02:31.420> way<00:02:32.550> but<00:02:33.840> Peter

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
wiring it is the same way but Peter

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.610 
wiring it is the same way but Peter
right<00:02:35.080> there<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:36.760> redstone<00:02:37.120> and<00:02:37.570> a<00:02:38.110> block<00:02:38.410> in

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
right there to redstone and a block in

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.920 
right there to redstone and a block in
the<00:02:38.740> middle<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.130> that'll<00:02:40.030> get<00:02:40.480> your<00:02:40.600> wiring

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
the middle and that'll get your wiring

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.980 
the middle and that'll get your wiring
for<00:02:41.260> now<00:02:42.160> for<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.880> part<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.720> stair<00:02:43.960> that

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
for now for the part the stair that

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.870 
for now for the part the stair that
moves<00:02:44.350> up<00:02:44.530> and<00:02:44.680> down<00:02:44.770> you<00:02:45.070> don't<00:02:45.310> need<00:02:45.490> sticky

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
moves up and down you don't need sticky

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.300 
moves up and down you don't need sticky
pistons<00:02:46.330> for<00:02:46.480> this<00:02:46.660> but<00:02:46.900> you<00:02:47.860> can<00:02:48.010> use<00:02:48.160> regular

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
pistons for this but you can use regular

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.040 
pistons for this but you can use regular
Pistons<00:02:48.850> but<00:02:48.970> it<00:02:49.390> doesn't<00:02:49.690> matter<00:02:49.750> if<00:02:49.900> you

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
Pistons but it doesn't matter if you

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.990 
Pistons but it doesn't matter if you
sticky<00:02:50.440> pistons<00:02:50.830> works<00:02:51.190> both<00:02:51.430> ways<00:02:51.700> you<00:02:51.880> want

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
sticky pistons works both ways you want

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.810 
sticky pistons works both ways you want
a<00:02:52.120> piston<00:02:52.710> have<00:02:53.710> any<00:02:53.860> sort<00:02:54.160> right<00:02:54.370> on<00:02:54.610> either

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
a piston have any sort right on either

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.220 
a piston have any sort right on either
side<00:02:56.580> that's<00:02:57.580> where<00:02:57.790> that's<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:58.960> change

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
side that's where that's the change

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.830 
side that's where that's the change
block<00:02:59.440> that's<00:02:59.620> going<00:02:59.890> to<00:03:00.090> be<00:03:01.090> pushing<00:03:01.390> up<00:03:01.630> and

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
block that's going to be pushing up and

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.590 
block that's going to be pushing up and
down<00:03:01.990> so<00:03:02.500> to<00:03:03.460> what<00:03:03.640> to<00:03:03.850> make<00:03:04.030> sure<00:03:04.180> this<00:03:04.300> is<00:03:04.450> why

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
down so to what to make sure this is why

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.120 
down so to what to make sure this is why
from<00:03:04.780> this<00:03:04.960> I'd<00:03:05.110> put<00:03:05.290> a<00:03:05.320> block<00:03:05.590> right<00:03:05.830> behind

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
from this I'd put a block right behind

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.690 
from this I'd put a block right behind
it<00:03:06.340> and<00:03:07.050> there<00:03:08.050> it's<00:03:08.200> already<00:03:08.560> required<00:03:09.010> so

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
it and there it's already required so

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.970 
it and there it's already required so
now<00:03:09.910> also<00:03:10.360> to<00:03:10.690> get<00:03:11.140> these<00:03:11.380> fossils<00:03:11.860> you're

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
now also to get these fossils you're

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.230 
now also to get these fossils you're
going<00:03:12.160> to<00:03:12.220> want<00:03:12.340> to<00:03:12.400> use<00:03:12.520> a<00:03:12.550> sticky<00:03:13.030> piston

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
going to want to use a sticky piston

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.960 
going to want to use a sticky piston
right<00:03:14.230> there<00:03:14.530> on<00:03:14.800> the<00:03:14.890> bottom<00:03:15.220> now<00:03:15.640> let's<00:03:15.850> see

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
right there on the bottom now let's see

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.180 
right there on the bottom now let's see
what<00:03:16.060> we<00:03:16.210> have<00:03:16.240> so<00:03:16.600> far<00:03:16.630> so<00:03:17.050> we've<00:03:17.170> got<00:03:17.350> this

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
what we have so far so we've got this

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:24.810 
what we have so far so we've got this
side<00:03:18.460> pushes<00:03:19.420> out<00:03:19.680> in<00:03:21.030> this<00:03:22.030> side<00:03:23.730> pushes<00:03:24.730> the

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
side pushes out in this side pushes the

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.910 
side pushes out in this side pushes the
stairs<00:03:25.090> out<00:03:25.380> okay<00:03:26.380> so<00:03:27.310> all<00:03:27.340> that<00:03:27.670> set<00:03:28.000> now<00:03:28.920> for

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
stairs out okay so all that set now for

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.580 
stairs out okay so all that set now for
the<00:03:30.040> wiring<00:03:30.460> of<00:03:30.610> the<00:03:30.640> floor<00:03:31.330> the<00:03:31.870> floor<00:03:32.080> pieces

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
the wiring of the floor the floor pieces

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.000 
the wiring of the floor the floor pieces
that<00:03:32.830> are<00:03:32.950> going<00:03:33.100> to<00:03:33.190> extend<00:03:33.490> up<00:03:34.470> we<00:03:35.470> want<00:03:35.920> to

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
that are going to extend up we want to

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.130 
that are going to extend up we want to
look<00:03:36.130> at<00:03:36.310> where<00:03:36.610> whatever<00:03:37.270> blocks<00:03:37.630> that<00:03:37.870> these

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
look at where whatever blocks that these

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.440 
look at where whatever blocks that these
Pistons<00:03:38.740> right<00:03:38.950> here<00:03:39.070> will<00:03:39.250> be<00:03:39.400> on<00:03:39.580> once<00:03:40.240> these

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
Pistons right here will be on once these

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.630 
Pistons right here will be on once these
pistons<00:03:40.960> are<00:03:41.110> extended<00:03:41.620> so<00:03:41.920> in<00:03:42.100> that<00:03:42.220> case<00:03:42.430> it

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
pistons are extended so in that case it

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.780 
pistons are extended so in that case it
sees<00:03:42.880> three<00:03:43.240> blocks<00:03:43.540> right<00:03:43.750> here<00:03:44.460> these<00:03:45.460> three

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
sees three blocks right here these three

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.700 
sees three blocks right here these three
are<00:03:45.850> the<00:03:45.910> one<00:03:46.120> we<00:03:46.270> want<00:03:46.420> to<00:03:46.570> look<00:03:46.750> at<00:03:46.900> so<00:03:47.620> when

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:47.710 
are the one we want to look at so when

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:53.580 
are the one we want to look at so when
we<00:03:47.800> get<00:03:48.010> down<00:03:48.280> to<00:03:48.310> wire<00:03:48.670> it

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.040 

it's<00:03:54.160> these<00:03:54.580> three<00:03:55.120> right<00:03:55.330> that<00:03:55.660> I'm<00:03:55.780> looking

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
it's these three right that I'm looking

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.790 
it's these three right that I'm looking
at<00:03:56.170> right<00:03:56.200> now

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.740 

so<00:03:59.800> we're<00:03:59.950> going<00:04:00.040> to<00:04:00.130> want<00:04:00.310> to<00:04:00.430> set<00:04:00.700> Peter's<00:04:01.540> to

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
so we're going to want to set Peter's to

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.059 
so we're going to want to set Peter's to
each<00:04:01.930> of<00:04:02.110> them

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.979 

and<00:04:05.310> then<00:04:05.879> the<00:04:06.090> wiring<00:04:06.540> behind<00:04:07.230> it<00:04:07.640> so<00:04:08.640> now

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
and then the wiring behind it so now

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.360 
and then the wiring behind it so now
with<00:04:09.989> the<00:04:10.109> door<00:04:10.319> like<00:04:10.469> this<00:04:10.709> timing<00:04:11.249> is

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
with the door like this timing is

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.849 
with the door like this timing is
essential<00:04:11.639> it's<00:04:12.389> crucial<00:04:13.109> to<00:04:13.139> how<00:04:13.439> the<00:04:13.499> store

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
essential it's crucial to how the store

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:15.199 
essential it's crucial to how the store
operates<00:04:14.310> so<00:04:14.459> we<00:04:14.549> want<00:04:14.760> to<00:04:14.790> make<00:04:14.939> sure<00:04:14.969> that

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
operates so we want to make sure that

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.229 
operates so we want to make sure that
this<00:04:15.359> repeater<00:04:15.780> is<00:04:16.049> set<00:04:16.829> because<00:04:17.400> at<00:04:17.669> least<00:04:18.000> a

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
this repeater is set because at least a

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:24.830 
this repeater is set because at least a
fold<00:04:18.509> just<00:04:19.070> fuller<00:04:20.070> this<00:04:20.729> delay<00:04:23.630> behind<00:04:24.630> these

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
fold just fuller this delay behind these

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.659 
fold just fuller this delay behind these
four<00:04:25.349> Pistons<00:04:25.800> right<00:04:25.949> there<00:04:26.160> so<00:04:26.310> now<00:04:26.460> let's

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
four Pistons right there so now let's

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:31.820 
four Pistons right there so now let's
look<00:04:26.789> at<00:04:26.940> how<00:04:27.090> that's<00:04:27.330> going<00:04:27.539> to<00:04:27.599> work<00:04:30.830> so

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
look at how that's going to work so

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.400 
look at how that's going to work so
we're<00:04:32.190> also<00:04:32.370> going<00:04:33.330> to<00:04:33.419> want<00:04:33.479> to<00:04:33.990> set<00:04:34.229> this

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
we're also going to want to set this

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.610 
we're also going to want to set this
repeater<00:04:34.830> right<00:04:34.979> here<00:04:35.190> to<00:04:35.520> to<00:04:35.849> take<00:04:36.120> the<00:04:36.270> leg

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
repeater right here to to take the leg

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.629 
repeater right here to to take the leg
now<00:04:37.620> to<00:04:38.580> make<00:04:38.759> this<00:04:38.970> middle<00:04:39.449> piston<00:04:40.080> go<00:04:40.639> we

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
now to make this middle piston go we

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:44.749 
now to make this middle piston go we
want<00:04:41.880> to<00:04:41.970> put<00:04:42.210> a<00:04:42.419> block<00:04:42.840> right<00:04:43.349> behind<00:04:43.740> it<00:04:43.979> or

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:44.759 
want to put a block right behind it or

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:47.270 
want to put a block right behind it or
in<00:04:44.880> front<00:04:45.120> of<00:04:45.210> it<00:04:45.330> we<00:04:46.169> want<00:04:46.440> a<00:04:46.680> repeater<00:04:47.190> on

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
in front of it we want a repeater on

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:50.680 
in front of it we want a repeater on
both<00:04:47.669> sides<00:04:48.000> with<00:04:48.449> a<00:04:48.479> full<00:04:48.840> four<00:04:49.199> tape<00:04:49.470> delay

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
both sides with a full four tape delay

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.790 
both sides with a full four tape delay
wire<00:04:51.690> it<00:04:51.870> up<00:04:51.930> to<00:04:52.110> each<00:04:52.259> side<00:04:52.550> so<00:04:53.550> that<00:04:53.759> way

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
wire it up to each side so that way

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.850 
wire it up to each side so that way
power<00:04:55.800> up<00:04:55.979> each<00:04:56.160> side

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.310 

this<00:05:01.460> side

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.930 

now<00:05:04.920> you<00:05:05.010> can<00:05:05.190> see<00:05:05.370> why<00:05:05.490> we<00:05:05.640> didn't<00:05:05.880> need

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
now you can see why we didn't need

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.670 
now you can see why we didn't need
sticky<00:05:06.360> piston<00:05:06.750> tears<00:05:06.990> because<00:05:07.200> this<00:05:07.410> block

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
sticky piston tears because this block

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.500 
sticky piston tears because this block
will<00:05:07.710> just<00:05:08.040> push<00:05:08.250> it<00:05:08.280> over<00:05:08.640> and<00:05:08.760> swap<00:05:09.000> it<00:05:09.210> you

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
will just push it over and swap it you

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.030 
will just push it over and swap it you
can<00:05:09.720> use<00:05:09.930> ticket<00:05:10.260> Pistons<00:05:10.620> if<00:05:10.710> you<00:05:10.830> want

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040 
can use ticket Pistons if you want

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.310 
can use ticket Pistons if you want
doesn't<00:05:11.640> matter<00:05:11.760> so<00:05:12.660> now<00:05:12.840> that<00:05:12.870> we've<00:05:13.140> got

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
doesn't matter so now that we've got

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.530 
doesn't matter so now that we've got
both<00:05:13.500> sides<00:05:13.860> working<00:05:14.130> we<00:05:14.880> just<00:05:15.090> have<00:05:15.240> to<00:05:15.270> wire

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
both sides working we just have to wire

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.830 
both sides working we just have to wire
them<00:05:15.690> both<00:05:15.900> up<00:05:16.140> so<00:05:17.040> we<00:05:17.160> bring<00:05:17.400> out<00:05:17.610> both<00:05:18.060> these

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
them both up so we bring out both these

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.040 
them both up so we bring out both these
parts<00:05:19.290> we're<00:05:19.980> going<00:05:20.100> to<00:05:20.160> make<00:05:20.310> our<00:05:20.520> basic<00:05:21.050> ABB

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
parts we're going to make our basic ABB

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:33.590 
parts we're going to make our basic ABB
a<00:05:22.080> switch<00:05:26.120> 8<00:05:28.010> put<00:05:29.010> that

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.360 

your<00:05:34.200> repeaters<00:05:34.710> in<00:05:34.830> the<00:05:35.010> mini<00:05:35.250> here

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
your repeaters in the mini here

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.370 
your repeaters in the mini here
so<00:05:37.940> notice<00:05:38.270> how<00:05:38.449> it<00:05:38.600> goes<00:05:38.900> in<00:05:39.080> a<00:05:39.169> pattern

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 
so notice how it goes in a pattern

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:40.460 
so notice how it goes in a pattern
around

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
around

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.460 
around
this<00:05:40.980> block<00:05:41.280> now<00:05:42.090> well<00:05:42.870> this<00:05:43.110> one<00:05:43.320> you're

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 
this block now well this one you're

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.660 
this block now well this one you're
going<00:05:43.590> to<00:05:43.650> want<00:05:43.830> to<00:05:43.950> invert<00:05:44.280> the<00:05:44.490> outcome<00:05:46.670> so

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:47.670 
going to want to invert the outcome so

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.000 
going to want to invert the outcome so
this<00:05:48.660> one<00:05:48.900> is<00:05:49.170> going<00:05:49.410> to<00:05:49.530> just<00:05:49.800> flow<00:05:49.980> naturally

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
this one is going to just flow naturally

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.620 
this one is going to just flow naturally
in

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.660 

so<00:05:54.630> to<00:05:55.440> make<00:05:55.470> sure<00:05:55.830> these<00:05:56.070> this<00:05:56.400> works

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:56.670 
so to make sure these this works

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.720 
so to make sure these this works
properly<00:05:56.970> make<00:05:57.390> these<00:05:57.690> three<00:05:58.050> repeaters<00:05:58.730> that

00:05:59.720 --> 00:05:59.730 
properly make these three repeaters that

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.540 
properly make these three repeaters that
go<00:06:00.000> and<00:06:00.360> a<00:06:00.870> full<00:06:01.110> circle<00:06:01.380> around<00:06:01.770> make<00:06:02.370> them

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
go and a full circle around make them

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.690 
go and a full circle around make them
fold<00:06:02.910> delay<00:06:03.860> now<00:06:04.860> when<00:06:05.070> we<00:06:05.190> light<00:06:05.400> this<00:06:05.640> thing

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:05.700 
fold delay now when we light this thing

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:10.500 
fold delay now when we light this thing
up<00:06:06.090> it<00:06:06.870> should<00:06:07.110> work<00:06:07.350> perfectly

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:10.510 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.470 

look<00:06:11.080> at<00:06:11.230> that

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:12.480 
look at that

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.580 
look at that
really

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:15.590 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.320 

so<00:06:16.100> now<00:06:16.250> all<00:06:16.280> you<00:06:16.610> have<00:06:16.640> to<00:06:16.790> do<00:06:16.970> is<00:06:17.090> make<00:06:17.300> a

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:17.330 
so now all you have to do is make a

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.920 
so now all you have to do is make a
floor<00:06:17.690> for<00:06:17.930> it<00:06:18.050> so<00:06:18.970> just<00:06:19.970> whatever<00:06:20.510> whatever

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:20.930 
floor for it so just whatever whatever

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:32.330 
floor for it so just whatever whatever
for<00:06:21.410> you<00:06:21.560> want<00:06:21.880> put<00:06:22.880> it<00:06:22.970> in<00:06:24.490> there

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:37.959 

use<00:06:32.970> your<00:06:33.150> form

00:06:37.959 --> 00:06:37.969 

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:40.419 

you<00:06:38.449> can't<00:06:38.719> even<00:06:38.839> tell<00:06:39.139> it<00:06:39.259> was<00:06:39.289> there<00:06:39.589> so

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:40.429 
you can't even tell it was there so

00:06:40.429 --> 00:06:42.729 
you can't even tell it was there so
there<00:06:40.639> you<00:06:40.789> go<00:06:40.819> hope<00:06:41.629> you<00:06:41.839> liked<00:06:42.019> the<00:06:42.169> video<00:06:42.289> if

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:42.739 
there you go hope you liked the video if

00:06:42.739 --> 00:06:45.279 
there you go hope you liked the video if
you<00:06:42.949> want<00:06:43.189> any<00:06:43.429> more<00:06:43.639> just<00:06:44.299> tell<00:06:44.719> me<00:06:44.869> if<00:06:45.049> you
