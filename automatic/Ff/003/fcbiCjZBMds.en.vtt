00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:24.279
 obviously I played I was a group 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:28.570
 with another pair of goals 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:31.749

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:36.010
 in the section of christopher he was having 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:40.510
 a practice match with us on black ops 2 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:42.340
 that I take this opportunity to greet him and you 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.320
 to invite you to pass in his channel 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.719
 that he also has a youtube channel that 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.840
 I say I will then leave you an inscription anyway 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:55.390
 I tell you on the fly that the game is played 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:58.949
 with a msc cruises here this 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:01.420
 this weapon with silencer e 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.140
 The total data rechargers will be 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.360
 here is the bonus class 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:12.310
 I had inflexible as a first 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.900
 bonus and steel and the type 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.840
 magician who does not make a mistake 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.369
 call as per the bonuses and how 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.720
 last focus is the one you are familiar with 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:21.369
 plus the one down after the race that you don't 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.450
 I remember what it's called as if 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:27.610
 decisions is using an of an attack 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.950
 lightning the one that throws so much active 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.130
 4 predator is so and finally revel 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.950
 the helicopter, however, the game is 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.229
 a 42 6 so nothing but a 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.340
 nice game in short, beautiful left 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.420
 with lots of kills 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.490
 then I failed to launch 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.439
 even a helicopter then 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.750
 anyway I wanted to talk to you a little 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:53.359
 black ops 2 to give opinions 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.869
 which are a little more founded and 

00:01:53.359 --> 00:02:01.549
 especially a little more we say they go 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:03.829
 towards how the fuck is said to be more final 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:06.020
 more decisive on this game after a while 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:07.250
 of time I've played with level 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.560
 34 then Msgr 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.239
 I do not say that I know him very well 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.579
 I play, however, for what I have known 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.549
 so far I can give these 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:20.180
 these I can draw these conclusions 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:26.629
 let's say first of all the game mi 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:29.030
 like the game I like it not very much 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:30.890
 but in fact I like the first few days 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.349
 I was playing this game 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.450
 really shit I couldn't play 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:37.549
 he could not find a weapon with which I was 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.700
 I find it good there really has been almost 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:43.579
 a disaster while in the end I have 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.440
 tried the second the second first 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.730
 machine guns are however after the 7 MP 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.500
 I do not remember what it's called is the one 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.200
 that recharge demonstrates the aato vabbè 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.819
 and then finally I tried this which I am 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.019
 the two machine guns with which I am 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.819
 I find it better then with these two 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.049
 I can play gameplay 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.760
 decent 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.200
 while instead with all the rifles 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.569
 assault that I have tried so far not 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.010
 I even managed to do one 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:04.430
 so positive things started 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.010
 gender 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.750
 and it gave me enough trouble 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.870
 but after trying these where and lawn 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.190
 in short, these are my rams 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:17.419
 think again or I'm starting to change my mind 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:19.819
 on this game then then i wanted to tell you that 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:20.870
 to level quickly vi 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:22.579
 I recommend playing a site neither 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.829
 confirmed then you will see at the end of the game 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:27.169
 how many points did I make this game 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:30.319
 having also confirmed as a thing 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:32.389
 like 27 platelets so I went 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.470
 even a lot for goals this is 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:35.540
 the game I liked in 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.209
 particular because I managed to 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:41.840
 go both for objectives and obviously 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:45.019
 for those who are here I have also leveled now 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.930
 this is 34 instead 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:50.250
 what you have just seen that when 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.620
 he was launching the course but 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.200
 and got to one who killed me I was 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.540
 freshly baked then on black ops 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.990
 they have really balanced all of them 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.730
 the weapons really have high last 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:04.320
 hope the dead man's hand added 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.870
 but this turret that numbs you 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.480
 people will live behind the commercials 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.160
 they left exactly as before 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.080
 not to mention the connection that 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.670
 this is one of the very few matches 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.859
 this he had managed to do today with one 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.450
 Decent connection because I did 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:20.340
 interrupted version 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.700
 or as wide as like camels 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.840
 dead ones that is absurd things also 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.750
 because we are playing 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.610
 I would like to remember it on servers 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.260
 Australian Australian servers and with 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.950
 Italians have not yet activated them and 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:37.560
 I probably will never activate them 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:40.740
 I also wanted to tell you that this is a call 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:44.220
 of duty as call of duty was 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:46.520
 created created a unique unique discovery 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.820
 the purpose of profit in my opinion 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:52.260
 even if good or bad good or bad here 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:54.180
 always doing everything in his head 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.910
 them with usual here in this game 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.160
 in this game piece they tried to 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:02.520
 get closer to the demands of 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:05.940
 player also because there are those who 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.550
 they have the crap connection that that 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.290
 they'll say i want private servers not 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.440
 want to start those who have the 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:15.900
 I mean semi shit connection 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.860
 private media servers don't want to 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.750
 start while those who have us 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.510
 super connection pull I do not want 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:24.180
 private servers so it's a bit of a give 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:27.210
 a raise to someone and give another 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.870
 so then i don't know if maybe you are 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:34.770
 limited on this on the connection 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:39.419
 of the art vision player that of the dead 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:42.419
 I'm not sure oh well one of them is good 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:44.460
 or in short this game seems 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:47.130
 however well structured the weapons are 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.590
 balanced though in my opinion all 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:52.570
 how many have virtually no ass is 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:55.520
 something really absurd 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:58.100
 I have not found a weapon that recoils so much 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.950
 that seems seems to ferries 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:04.850
 some less cumin without less laser some things 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:08.030
 strange on some on some weapons though for 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:09.710
 example I assault rifles as already 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:14.180
 just said I can't use them but 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:16.250
 in the sense that there can not have been 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.950
 they are not unusable for putting 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:22.610
 sky on maybe one more landing 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:24.680
 the latter as ska racca n 94 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:27.560
 but for now with the there are now at 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.140
 34 in short I can't use them e 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:32.630
 I'm finding only with machine guns 

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:33.650
 however decided to bring our own 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:36.050
 gameplay 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:37.940
 also because good or bad I went into 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.370
 series I think that if I had been one could 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:44.120
 draw this pure work think a little 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:46.310
 so there is broken tv mob on two fox 2 is 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.680
 obviously the insights what will succeed 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:50.050
 to take fashion here too, however, is a 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:54.350
 another speech 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:56.480
 however the game was over we are 

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.880
 at 90 points we went because 

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.710
 obviously if you find the gozzi in front 

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:05.300
 I advise you to leave immediately 

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:07.640
 as you can see that it was klaus j ax e 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:09.440
 their great expression though 

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.930
 klaus now I think we know it with 

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.880
 you know it and therefore how you can 

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:15.620
 see i was going just like i 

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.080
 deficient to run on the platelets 

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:22.540
 because I wanted to make both a good score 

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:27.260
 that we say a good score of struts a 

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:29.420
 take home and of course it is obviously 

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:32.090
 arrive as early as the game time 

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:35.690
 it's over we can see that I've done a 

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:38.960
 nice 5 thousand points with a 27 platelets 

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:40.370
 confirm a 40 26 I greet you past 

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:44.830
