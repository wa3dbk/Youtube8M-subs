brakes and then undo the quick-release
if<00:00:07.500> it's<00:00:07.740> the<00:00:07.799> front<00:00:08.040> wheel<00:00:08.189> you<00:00:08.490> need<00:00:08.610> to

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
if it's the front wheel you need to

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.400 
if it's the front wheel you need to
unwind<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:09.210> quick-release<00:00:09.420> slightly<00:00:10.050> so

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
unwind the quick-release slightly so

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.080 
unwind the quick-release slightly so

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
rim and then tuck the rest of the tube

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.390 
rim and then tuck the rest of the tube
back<00:01:24.180> into<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.600> well<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.960> rim<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.950> refit

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
back into the well of the rim to refit

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.370 
back into the well of the rim to refit
the<00:01:26.549> last<00:01:26.759> side<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.240> top<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.170> really

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
the last side of the top and it really

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.719 
the last side of the top and it really
helps<00:01:28.680> if<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.860> wheel<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:29.130> on<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.369> ground<00:01:29.610> in

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
helps if the wheel is on the ground in

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.520 
helps if the wheel is on the ground in
front<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:30.060> me<00:01:30.150> pointing<00:01:30.600> out<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.259> can<00:01:31.409> just

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
front of me pointing out so I can just

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.469 
front of me pointing out so I can just
tuck<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.950> bead<00:01:32.159> inside<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.970> rim<00:01:33.150> with<00:01:33.390> my

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
tuck the bead inside the rim with my

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.719 
tuck the bead inside the rim with my
fingers<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.020> then<00:01:34.470> push<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.130> with<00:01:35.280> both<00:01:35.520> my

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
fingers and then push it with both my

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.640 
fingers and then push it with both my
thumb's<00:01:36.030> on<00:01:36.299> either<00:01:36.509> side<00:01:36.869> all<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.560> way

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
thumb's on either side all the way

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.499 
thumb's on either side all the way
around<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.950> rim<00:01:38.130> take<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.820> last<00:01:39.060> bit<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.270> bead

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
around the rim take the last bit of bead

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.179 
around the rim take the last bit of bead
and<00:01:39.780> insert<00:01:40.259> your<00:01:40.439> tire<00:01:40.680> leave<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:40.950> very

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
and insert your tire leave it very

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.130 
and insert your tire leave it very
carefully<00:01:41.430> underneath<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.659> then<00:01:42.869> lever

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
carefully underneath it and then lever

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.740 
carefully underneath it and then lever
it<00:01:43.439> so<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:44.070> tire<00:01:44.430> just<00:01:44.700> pops<00:01:45.000> back<00:01:45.210> inside<00:01:45.540> the

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
it so the tire just pops back inside the

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.660 
it so the tire just pops back inside the
rim<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.259> might<00:01:46.409> need<00:01:46.560> two<00:01:46.860> or<00:01:47.189> three<00:01:47.430> tire

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
rim you might need two or three tire

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.069 
rim you might need two or three tire
leaders<00:01:48.000> for<00:01:48.149> this<00:01:48.240> last<00:01:48.509> little<00:01:48.750> bit

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
leaders for this last little bit

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.630 
leaders for this last little bit
be<00:01:49.500> really<00:01:49.770> careful<00:01:49.920> at<00:01:50.159> this<00:01:50.250> point<00:01:50.520> because

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
be really careful at this point because

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.760 
be really careful at this point because
it's<00:01:50.880> quite<00:01:51.030> easy<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.450> pinch<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.350> inner<00:01:52.500> tube

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
it's quite easy to pinch the inner tube

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.319 
it's quite easy to pinch the inner tube
with<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.189> tire<00:01:53.430> leave<00:01:53.640> when<00:01:54.000> you're<00:01:54.119> doing

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
with the tire leave when you're doing

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.389 
with the tire leave when you're doing
this<00:01:54.450> last<00:01:54.689> stage<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.500> just<00:01:55.680> double-check

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
this last stage so just double-check

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.069 
this last stage so just double-check
when<00:01:56.670> you've<00:01:56.790> got<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.000> tiny<00:01:57.240> bit<00:01:57.420> inserted

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
when you've got the tiny bit inserted

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.130 
when you've got the tiny bit inserted
before<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.560> start<00:01:58.799> applying<00:01:59.009> in<00:01:59.189> pressure

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
before you start applying in pressure

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.310 
before you start applying in pressure
in<00:02:00.200> a<00:02:00.320> tube<00:02:00.500> isn't<00:02:00.920> caught<00:02:01.990> make<00:02:02.990> sure<00:02:03.170> that

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
in a tube isn't caught make sure that

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.200 
in a tube isn't caught make sure that
the<00:02:03.470> tire<00:02:03.680> is<00:02:03.710> fully<00:02:04.040> seated<00:02:04.370> on<00:02:04.550> the<00:02:04.640> rim<00:02:04.850> and

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
the tire is fully seated on the rim and

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.610 
the tire is fully seated on the rim and
there<00:02:05.360> are<00:02:05.450> no<00:02:05.600> bits<00:02:05.810> of<00:02:05.930> inner<00:02:06.050> tube<00:02:06.320> sticking

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
there are no bits of inner tube sticking

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.469 
there are no bits of inner tube sticking
out<00:02:06.920> is<00:02:07.159> when<00:02:07.340> you<00:02:07.430> reinflates<00:02:07.820> it<00:02:08.149> at<00:02:08.360> this

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
out is when you reinflates it at this

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.300 
out is when you reinflates it at this
point<00:02:08.750> it<00:02:08.869> could<00:02:09.140> burst<00:02:09.410> put<00:02:10.100> the<00:02:10.160> wheel<00:02:10.280> back

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
point it could burst put the wheel back

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.250 
point it could burst put the wheel back
in<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:10.729> frame<00:02:11.000> and<00:02:11.240> away<00:02:11.480> you<00:02:11.540> get<00:02:11.750> just

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
in the frame and away you get just

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.690 
in the frame and away you get just
remember<00:02:12.590> that<00:02:12.740> if<00:02:12.920> it's<00:02:13.130> the<00:02:13.220> back<00:02:13.430> wheel

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
remember that if it's the back wheel

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.130 
remember that if it's the back wheel
that<00:02:13.819> you<00:02:13.880> do<00:02:14.060> you<00:02:14.510> need<00:02:14.660> to<00:02:14.750> pull<00:02:14.990> the

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
that you do you need to pull the

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.510 
that you do you need to pull the
derailleur<00:02:15.290> towards<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.010> back<00:02:16.160> of<00:02:16.310> the<00:02:16.370> bike

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
derailleur towards the back of the bike

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.250 
derailleur towards the back of the bike
again<00:02:16.880> just<00:02:17.180> so<00:02:17.270> that<00:02:17.420> it<00:02:17.570> can<00:02:17.720> clear<00:02:18.020> the

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
again just so that it can clear the

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.199 
again just so that it can clear the
sprockets<00:02:18.709> and<00:02:18.980> fat<00:02:19.280> with<00:02:19.430> seats<00:02:19.730> properly

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
to go you can take the tire off without

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.620 
to go you can take the tire off without
using<00:02:24.890> tire<00:02:25.220> levers<00:02:25.520> and<00:02:25.670> this<00:02:25.820> is<00:02:25.940> my<00:02:26.060> pro<00:02:26.360> tip

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
using tire levers and this is my pro tip

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.720 
using tire levers and this is my pro tip
take<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:27.530> wheel<00:02:27.709> and<00:02:27.950> put<00:02:28.100> it<00:02:28.190> in<00:02:28.250> front<00:02:28.430> of<00:02:28.610> me

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
take the wheel and put it in front of me

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.059 
take the wheel and put it in front of me
facing<00:02:29.209> up<00:02:29.360> I<00:02:29.569> take<00:02:30.050> my<00:02:30.170> thumbs<00:02:30.440> and<00:02:30.680> I<00:02:30.739> run<00:02:30.950> it

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
facing up I take my thumbs and I run it

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:32.680 
facing up I take my thumbs and I run it
on<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.250> inside<00:02:31.760> of<00:02:31.790> the<00:02:32.030> bead<00:02:32.239> you're<00:02:32.480> trying

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
on the inside of the bead you're trying

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.810 
on the inside of the bead you're trying
to<00:02:32.750> force<00:02:32.989> any<00:02:33.290> slack<00:02:33.739> between<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.280> bead<00:02:34.489> and

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
to force any slack between the bead and

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.880 
to force any slack between the bead and
the<00:02:34.910> rib<00:02:35.120> towards<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:36.020> bottom<00:02:36.230> and<00:02:36.680> then<00:02:36.860> I

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
the rib towards the bottom and then I

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.070 
the rib towards the bottom and then I
take<00:02:37.190> this<00:02:37.420> hopefully<00:02:38.420> there's<00:02:38.570> enough<00:02:38.840> there

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
take this hopefully there's enough there

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.930 
take this hopefully there's enough there
that<00:02:39.110> it<00:02:39.440> will<00:02:39.560> clear<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:40.070> rim<00:02:40.280> you<00:02:40.640> can<00:02:40.790> just

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
that it will clear the rim you can just

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.280 
that it will clear the rim you can just
pull<00:02:41.150> it<00:02:41.239> over<00:02:41.330> with<00:02:41.570> your<00:02:41.690> fingers<00:02:42.050> or<00:02:42.080> your
