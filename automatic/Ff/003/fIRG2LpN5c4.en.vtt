00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:23.669 
you know what what you're looking at

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:27.169 
you know what what you're looking at
here<00:00:23.730> is<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.119> series<00:00:24.570> of<00:00:24.829> solenoids<00:00:25.910> each<00:00:26.910> one

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:27.179 
here is a series of solenoids each one

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:29.830 
here is a series of solenoids each one
of<00:00:27.269> these<00:00:27.359> controls<00:00:27.989> a<00:00:28.169> different<00:00:28.529> gear<00:00:28.739> for

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
of these controls a different gear for

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.349 
of these controls a different gear for
combination<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:30.989> gears

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:32.359 
combination of gears

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:35.170 
combination of gears
and<00:00:32.480> the<00:00:32.870> one<00:00:33.079> after

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
and the one after

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.700 
and the one after
goes<00:00:35.750> right<00:00:35.870> here<00:00:36.320> that's<00:00:36.829> the<00:00:37.010> sspc<00:00:37.670> -<00:00:38.149> a

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
goes right here that's the sspc - a

goes right here that's the sspc - a
Coast<00:00:39.710> crutch<00:00:40.070> solenoid

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.709 

we<00:00:44.870> got<00:00:45.079> my<00:00:45.289> replacement<00:00:45.679> solenoid<00:00:46.399> hear

00:00:46.709 --> 00:00:46.719 
we got my replacement solenoid hear

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:50.709 
we got my replacement solenoid hear
about<00:00:47.719> it<00:00:47.899> from<00:00:48.019> towels<00:00:48.320> Lee's<00:00:48.940> $83<00:00:49.940> and

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
about it from towels Lee's $83 and

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.240 
about it from towels Lee's $83 and
they're<00:00:51.649> really<00:00:51.979> super<00:00:52.519> easy<00:00:53.920> make<00:00:54.920> sure<00:00:55.100> it's

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
they're really super easy make sure it's

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.570 
they're really super easy make sure it's
clean

00:00:59.570 --> 00:00:59.580 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:09.109 

tracking<00:01:03.300> time<00:01:04.300> to<00:01:04.630> returning

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:16.530 

-<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.170> here<00:01:10.409> similar

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.050 

mine<00:01:17.540> did<00:01:17.750> not<00:01:17.900> come<00:01:18.170> with<00:01:18.320> a<00:01:18.440> new<00:01:18.620> one<00:01:19.060> that's

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
mine did not come with a new one that's

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:30.789 
mine did not come with a new one that's
all<00:01:20.390> that<00:01:20.570> holds<00:01:20.840> it<00:01:20.930> in

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:39.039 

boom<00:01:31.340> there<00:01:31.939> it<00:01:31.969> is<00:01:34.090> electrical<00:01:35.090> connector<00:01:38.049> so

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
boom there it is electrical connector so

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.520 
boom there it is electrical connector so
you<00:01:39.079> have<00:01:39.320> a<00:01:39.939> ghost<00:01:40.939> Koch<00:01:41.270> and<00:01:42.460> direct-drive

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
you have a ghost Koch and direct-drive

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.440 
you have a ghost Koch and direct-drive
solenoid<00:01:45.530> that<00:01:45.890> are<00:01:46.729> both<00:01:46.880> the<00:01:47.060> same<00:01:49.329> then<00:01:50.329> you

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
solenoid that are both the same then you

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.690 
solenoid that are both the same then you
have<00:01:50.600> four<00:01:50.959> other<00:01:51.289> solenoids<00:01:51.890> that<00:01:52.219> are<00:01:52.369> a

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
have four other solenoids that are a

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.999 
have four other solenoids that are a
different<00:01:53.270> kind<00:01:53.810> but<00:01:54.140> also<00:01:54.319> they're<00:01:54.829> also

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
different kind but also they're also

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:55.870 
different kind but also they're also
same

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
same

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.200 
same
so<00:01:56.780> you<00:01:56.929> God<00:01:58.600> set<00:01:59.600> a<00:01:59.659> two<00:01:59.869> in<00:02:00.079> the<00:02:00.170> center<00:02:00.319> for

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
so you God set a two in the center for

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.950 
so you God set a two in the center for
take<00:02:03.200> pictures<00:02:03.680> of<00:02:03.799> this<00:02:03.890> for<00:02:04.220> reference

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
take pictures of this for reference

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.580 
take pictures of this for reference
never<00:02:05.960> wanted<00:02:06.350> to<00:02:06.409> know<00:02:06.500> where<00:02:07.040> your<00:02:08.590> where

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
never wanted to know where your where

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.970 
never wanted to know where your where
your<00:02:09.709> dipstick<00:02:10.190> goes<00:02:11.319> looks<00:02:12.319> like<00:02:12.530> your<00:02:12.709> cold

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
your dipstick goes looks like your cold

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.540 
your dipstick goes looks like your cold
line<00:02:13.240> top<00:02:14.240> of<00:02:14.270> your<00:02:14.480> cold<00:02:14.690> line<00:02:15.040> is<00:02:16.040> right

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
line top of your cold line is right

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.660 
line top of your cold line is right
above<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:17.780> level<00:02:17.959> of<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:18.290> solenoid<00:02:18.530> your<00:02:19.489> hot

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
above the level of the solenoid your hot

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.590 
above the level of the solenoid your hot
line<00:02:19.940> is<00:02:20.330> almost<00:02:21.050> to<00:02:21.470> the<00:02:21.590> top<00:02:21.800> of<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.040> pan<00:02:22.280> I

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
line is almost to the top of the pan I

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.400 
line is almost to the top of the pan I
went<00:02:23.600> in<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:23.750> top<00:02:24.739> of<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:24.980> valve<00:02:25.160> body<00:02:25.370> there

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
went in the top of the valve body there

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.740 
went in the top of the valve body there
so<00:02:27.790> good<00:02:28.790> to<00:02:28.910> know

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.020 

and<00:02:33.560> that's<00:02:33.920> it<00:02:34.160> I'm<00:02:34.340> going<00:02:34.490> to<00:02:34.520> put<00:02:34.730> the<00:02:34.820> pan

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
and that's it I'm going to put the pan

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.690 
and that's it I'm going to put the pan
back<00:02:35.060> on<00:02:35.740> refill<00:02:36.740> it<00:02:36.860> and<00:02:37.070> hopefully<00:02:37.580> it

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
back on refill it and hopefully it

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.120 
back on refill it and hopefully it
starts
