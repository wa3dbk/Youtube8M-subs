00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 The Digitar preset 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 The digitar preset assigns the Touch Y control to the amplitude release parameter. 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 This example uses the digitar preset and the X / Y control ball. 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 The position on the Y axis of the ball controls the level of distortion, put it high. 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 I play here a power chord. 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 By touching the upper part of the screen, the sound has a short release. 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 By touching the lower part of the screen, the sound has a long release. 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 This is therefore achieved with the release amplitude assigned to the Touch Y control. 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 The velocity of the notes (velocity note) is assigned to the Touch X control. 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 The notes are played louder depending on the location of the screen touched on the X axis (from left to right). This gives an interesting effect using the distortion and low pass filter effects. 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 It is also possible to drag the chords by keeping your finger on the screen.
