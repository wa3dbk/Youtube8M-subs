the<00:00:54.800> real<00:00:55.010> reason<00:00:55.340> why<00:00:55.460> I'm<00:00:55.579> out

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.050 

so<00:01:04.400> I<00:01:05.980> would<00:01:06.980> like<00:01:07.130> to<00:01:07.190> talk<00:01:07.460> about<00:01:07.640> something

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.050 

I<00:01:16.050> guess<00:01:17.050> it<00:01:17.200> would<00:01:17.320> be

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
I guess it would be

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.680 
I guess it would be
the<00:01:19.630> difference<00:01:20.079> is<00:01:20.259> between<00:01:20.970> my<00:01:21.970> old<00:01:22.149> bike

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
the difference is between my old bike

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:32.140 
the difference is between my old bike
the<00:01:24.260> ninja<00:01:24.530> 250<00:01:25.100> and<00:01:25.340> the<00:01:26.830> 03<00:01:27.830> is<00:01:28.070> at<00:01:28.220> X<00:01:28.400> 6<00:01:28.670> and

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.230 

does<00:01:32.720> hit<00:01:32.900> said<00:01:33.080> x6<00:01:33.530> yeah<00:01:33.860> I<00:01:33.920> did<00:01:34.130> okay<00:01:34.520> the

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
does hit said x6 yeah I did okay the

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.020 
does hit said x6 yeah I did okay the
deuce<00:01:35.450> is<00:01:35.780> okay<00:01:36.790> there's<00:01:37.790> a<00:01:37.850> lot<00:01:38.000> of

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
deuce is okay there's a lot of

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.110 
deuce is okay there's a lot of
differences<00:01:38.540> obviously<00:01:39.640> the<00:01:40.640> first<00:01:40.820> thing<00:01:40.970> I

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
differences obviously the first thing I

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.920 
differences obviously the first thing I
noticed<00:01:41.480> was

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.540 

first<00:01:44.930> of<00:01:45.080> all<00:01:45.140> let's<00:01:45.860> just<00:01:45.979> go<00:01:46.100> on<00:01:46.220> how<00:01:46.400> they

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
first of all let's just go on how they

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.630 
first of all let's just go on how they
ride<00:01:47.229> obviously<00:01:48.229> the<00:01:48.409> 636

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
ride obviously the 636

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.450 
ride obviously the 636
is<00:01:50.909> like<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.600> whole<00:01:51.840> lot<00:01:52.320> not<00:01:52.860> hold<00:01:53.130> up<00:01:53.280> is

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
is like a whole lot not hold up is

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.399 
is like a whole lot not hold up is
heavier<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:54.540> feels<00:01:54.780> more<00:01:55.020> bulky<00:01:55.850> than<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.409> OA

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
heavier it feels more bulky than the OA

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.870 
heavier it feels more bulky than the OA
250<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.460> so<00:01:59.850> I<00:02:00.150> first<00:02:01.050> got<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.770> felt<00:02:02.310> it

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
250 and so I first got it it felt it

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.880 
250 and so I first got it it felt it
made<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.090> huge<00:02:03.210> huge<00:02:04.200> difference

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
made a huge huge difference

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.410 
made a huge huge difference
because<00:02:06.159> it<00:02:06.310> felt<00:02:06.490> like<00:02:06.670> I<00:02:06.880> was<00:02:07.000> riding<00:02:07.330> on

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
because it felt like I was riding on

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.160 
because it felt like I was riding on
like<00:02:07.450> a<00:02:07.659> big<00:02:08.110> fatty<00:02:08.530> patty<00:02:09.569> patty<00:02:10.569> patty<00:02:10.869> I

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
like a big fatty patty patty patty I

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.430 
like a big fatty patty patty patty I
just<00:02:12.100> felt<00:02:12.370> like

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.180 

it<00:02:16.040> felt<00:02:16.280> different<00:02:16.730> like

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.410 

it<00:02:21.550> just<00:02:21.790> wasn't<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.210> same<00:02:22.300> you<00:02:22.960> know

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:36.180 

there's<00:02:26.930> a<00:02:27.020> homeboy<00:02:27.709> right<00:02:27.890> there

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.380 

guys<00:02:37.150> doesn't<00:02:37.450> even<00:02:37.540> have<00:02:37.750> an<00:02:37.870> uncle<00:02:38.350> see

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.930 

yeah<00:02:43.390> so<00:02:43.690> the<00:02:43.840> 636<00:02:44.500> felt<00:02:44.950> so<00:02:45.280> much<00:02:45.490> different

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
yeah so the 636 felt so much different

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.900 
yeah so the 636 felt so much different
because<00:02:46.090> it<00:02:46.720> was<00:02:47.530> big<00:02:47.860> and<00:02:48.190> it<00:02:48.310> felt<00:02:49.270> heavier

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
because it was big and it felt heavier

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.900 
because it was big and it felt heavier
and

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
and

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.390 
and
and<00:02:53.360> like<00:02:53.630> and<00:02:53.960> I<00:02:54.110> had<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:54.410> stabilizer<00:02:54.950> on<00:02:55.160> it

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
and like and I had the stabilizer on it

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.220 
and like and I had the stabilizer on it
and<00:02:55.580> I<00:02:55.670> didn't<00:02:55.910> know<00:02:56.000> what<00:02:56.150> it<00:02:56.240> did<00:02:56.450> well<00:02:57.170> I

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
and I didn't know what it did well I

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.630 
and I didn't know what it did well I
knew<00:02:57.410> what<00:02:57.560> a<00:02:57.590> kind<00:02:58.280> of<00:02:58.370> knew<00:02:58.460> what<00:02:58.610> a

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
knew what a kind of knew what a

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.390 
knew what a kind of knew what a
stabilized<00:02:59.120> it<00:02:59.390> but<00:02:59.620> so<00:03:00.620> was<00:03:00.800> it<00:03:00.950> used<00:03:01.070> to<00:03:01.250> it<00:03:01.370> i

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
stabilized it but so was it used to it i

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.580 
stabilized it but so was it used to it i
just<00:03:02.000> kept<00:03:02.240> messing<00:03:02.630> around<00:03:02.690> it<00:03:03.110> and<00:03:03.260> it<00:03:03.410> felt

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
just kept messing around it and it felt

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.320 
just kept messing around it and it felt
like<00:03:03.680> the<00:03:03.860> handlebars<00:03:04.430> are<00:03:04.670> like<00:03:04.790> really<00:03:05.060> hard

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
like the handlebars are like really hard

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
like the handlebars are like really hard
to<00:03:05.480> turn<00:03:06.340> so<00:03:07.340> i<00:03:07.730> guess<00:03:08.630> that's<00:03:08.840> what<00:03:09.020> it<00:03:09.140> feels

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
to turn so i guess that's what it feels

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.160 
to turn so i guess that's what it feels
like<00:03:09.440> when<00:03:09.650> you<00:03:09.770> step<00:03:10.040> up<00:03:10.190> to<00:03:10.250> a<00:03:10.400> bigger<00:03:10.670> bike

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.930 

so

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
so

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:54.670 

I<00:04:52.850> don't<00:04:53.480> know

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
I don't know

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.710 
I don't know
it<00:04:55.070> felt<00:04:55.310> like<00:04:55.340> I<00:04:55.580> could<00:04:55.759> pick<00:04:56.000> it<00:04:56.030> up<00:04:56.210> and<00:04:56.419> like

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
that's how light it felt and

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.410 
that's how light it felt and
so<00:05:01.950> the<00:05:02.070> perfect<00:05:02.520> size<00:05:02.670> for<00:05:02.700> me<00:05:03.000> I<00:05:03.030> could

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.420 
so the perfect size for me I could

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.710 
so the perfect size for me I could
almost<00:05:03.630> flat<00:05:04.110> foot<00:05:04.350> it

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.290 

so<00:05:07.720> it<00:05:07.960> was<00:05:08.110> just<00:05:08.140> a<00:05:08.320> good<00:05:08.470> size<00:05:08.680> for<00:05:08.890> me<00:05:09.300> but

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
so it was just a good size for me but

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.940 
so it was just a good size for me but
definitely<00:05:10.750> highway<00:05:11.110> sometimes<00:05:11.680> I<00:05:11.830> would

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950 
definitely highway sometimes I would

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.839 
definitely highway sometimes I would
have<00:05:12.100> to<00:05:12.220> go<00:05:12.340> down<00:05:12.550> here

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:13.849 
have to go down here

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:16.299 
have to go down here
not<00:05:14.360> always<00:05:14.599> if<00:05:15.529> I<00:05:15.619> didn't<00:05:15.889> really<00:05:16.039> have<00:05:16.129> a

00:05:16.299 --> 00:05:16.309 
not always if I didn't really have a

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:19.980 
not always if I didn't really have a
whole<00:05:16.520> lot<00:05:16.550> of<00:05:17.020> problems<00:05:18.020> passing<00:05:18.439> people

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
whole lot of problems passing people

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.530 
whole lot of problems passing people
anything<00:05:20.990> of<00:05:21.080> that<00:05:21.110> nature

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
so I didn't really have too much

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.860 
so I didn't really have too much
problems<00:05:27.600> passing<00:05:28.020> people

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410 
I was pretty good but it definitely

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.350 
I was pretty good but it definitely
didn't<00:05:38.860> feel<00:05:39.160> that<00:05:39.370> because<00:05:39.640> I<00:05:39.910> wrote<00:05:40.090> like

didn't feel that because I wrote like
boosts<00:05:41.050> is<00:05:41.230> a<00:05:41.260> couple<00:05:41.620> times<00:05:41.800> and<00:05:42.760> obviously

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
boosts is a couple times and obviously

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.820 
boosts is a couple times and obviously
that's<00:05:43.360> like<00:05:43.630> the<00:05:44.380> highest<00:05:44.590> you<00:05:44.950> could<00:05:45.130> go

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
that's like the highest you could go

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.580 
that's like the highest you could go
there's<00:05:47.520> a<00:05:47.610> like<00:05:47.790> sport<00:05:48.090> bike<00:05:48.300> and<00:05:49.080> so<00:05:49.290> there's

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
there's a like sport bike and so there's

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:50.900 
there's a like sport bike and so there's
obviously<00:05:49.710> different<00:05:50.340> the<00:05:50.490> only<00:05:50.640> thing<00:05:50.790> I

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:50.910 
obviously different the only thing I

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.950 
obviously different the only thing I
didn't<00:05:51.330> like<00:05:51.360> about<00:05:51.510> it<00:05:51.810> was<00:05:51.990> that<00:05:53.810> even<00:05:54.810> those

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
didn't like about it was that even those

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.350 
didn't like about it was that even those
faster<00:05:55.590> than<00:05:55.740> pretty<00:05:55.920> much<00:05:56.010> every<00:05:56.790> single<00:05:57.120> car

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 
faster than pretty much every single car

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.340 
faster than pretty much every single car
out<00:05:57.540> there<00:05:57.750> it<00:05:58.260> was<00:05:58.440> still<00:05:58.710> like<00:05:59.840> not<00:06:00.840> as<00:06:01.020> fast

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:01.350 
out there it was still like not as fast

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:03.350 
out there it was still like not as fast
I<00:06:01.800> still<00:06:02.250> love<00:06:02.400> the<00:06:02.520> bike<00:06:02.670> though<00:06:02.880> is<00:06:03.090> an

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
I still love the bike though is an

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.830 
I still love the bike though is an
excellent<00:06:03.750> city<00:06:04.080> bike<00:06:04.320> i<00:06:04.530> got<00:06:04.740> like

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.520 

say<00:06:08.840> 45<00:06:09.440> city<00:06:09.830> and<00:06:10.100> maybe<00:06:10.250> 55<00:06:11.140> highway<00:06:12.140> okay

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:12.530 
say 45 city and maybe 55 highway okay

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:14.740 
say 45 city and maybe 55 highway okay
maybe<00:06:12.740> a<00:06:13.130> little<00:06:13.280> bit<00:06:13.640> too<00:06:14.390> much<00:06:14.510> of<00:06:14.690> a

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:14.750 
maybe a little bit too much of a

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.720 
maybe a little bit too much of a
variance<00:06:15.200> but<00:06:15.470> uh<00:06:15.910> let's<00:06:16.910> say<00:06:17.060> 50<00:06:17.480> city<00:06:17.720> yeah

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:18.730 
variance but uh let's say 50 city yeah

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:24.510 
variance but uh let's say 50 city yeah
56-49<00:06:19.730> city<00:06:20.920> 55<00:06:21.940> dish<00:06:22.940> highway

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.610 
one time I got like fifty seven
I<00:06:29.210> don't<00:06:30.080> know<00:06:30.140> why<00:06:30.320> but

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:31.620 
I don't know why but

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.280 
I don't know why but

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:36.520 
couple times our budget eyes

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:42.119 
couple times our budget eyes
and<00:06:38.910> it<00:06:39.910> works<00:06:40.300> but<00:06:41.050> you<00:06:41.289> know<00:06:41.379> don't<00:06:41.410> try<00:06:42.039> to

go<00:06:42.370> on<00:06:42.490> the<00:06:42.580> highway<00:06:42.940> because<00:06:44.009> you're<00:06:45.009> pretty

00:06:45.149 --> 00:06:45.159 
go on the highway because you're pretty

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:47.320 
go on the highway because you're pretty
much<00:06:45.430> like<00:06:45.729> screwed

we have

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:50.659 
we have
but<00:06:49.110> you'll<00:06:49.260> be<00:06:49.410> like<00:06:49.590> slow<00:06:50.070> it'll<00:06:50.370> be<00:06:50.490> like

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:50.669 
but you'll be like slow it'll be like

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:52.750 
but you'll be like slow it'll be like
driving<00:06:51.150> a

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:57.490 
with

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.760 
with
riding<00:06:58.270> on<00:06:58.389> for<00:06:58.630> donuts

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:00.770 
riding on for donuts

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:03.640 
riding on for donuts
and<00:07:00.889> it<00:07:01.520> has<00:07:01.669> like<00:07:01.940> 200,000<00:07:02.840> miles<00:07:02.990> on<00:07:03.229> it<00:07:03.289> it's

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:03.650 
and it has like 200,000 miles on it it's

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:08.249 
and it has like 200,000 miles on it it's
like<00:07:03.800> that<00:07:04.389> so<00:07:05.389> slow<00:07:05.720> it<00:07:05.870> is<00:07:06.280> slow<00:07:07.280> no<00:07:07.520> power

00:07:08.249 --> 00:07:08.259 
like that so slow it is slow no power

00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:11.260 
like that so slow it is slow no power
pretty<00:07:09.259> much<00:07:09.379> has<00:07:09.590> to<00:07:09.620> be<00:07:09.800> in<00:07:09.889> life<00:07:10.099> the<00:07:10.940> lowest

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:11.270 
pretty much has to be in life the lowest

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.499 
pretty much has to be in life the lowest
gear<00:07:11.449> possible<00:07:12.020> just<00:07:12.259> to<00:07:12.409> even<00:07:12.500> get<00:07:12.800> anywhere

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:13.509 
gear possible just to even get anywhere

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:15.660 
gear possible just to even get anywhere
so

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:15.670 
so

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:17.640 
so
that<00:07:16.090> actually<00:07:16.300> did<00:07:16.570> suck<00:07:16.840> a<00:07:16.870> lot<00:07:17.110> about<00:07:17.290> it

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:17.650 
that actually did suck a lot about it

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:22.320 
that actually did suck a lot about it
but<00:07:17.860> uh<00:07:18.850> I'm<00:07:19.840> really<00:07:20.710> fast<00:07:21.010> because<00:07:21.280> like<00:07:21.790> talk

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:22.330 
but uh I'm really fast because like talk

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:28.380 
but uh I'm really fast because like talk
to<00:07:22.570> a<00:07:22.600> race<00:07:22.840> track<00:07:23.080> a<00:07:23.760> few<00:07:24.760> times<00:07:24.820> and

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:28.390 

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:32.620 

it<00:07:29.390> was<00:07:29.510> lots<00:07:29.630> of<00:07:29.780> fun

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:32.630 

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:34.879 

but

00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:34.889 
but

00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:38.300 
but
and<00:07:35.249> it<00:07:35.969> was<00:07:36.120> a<00:07:36.150> very<00:07:36.479> comfortable<00:07:37.050> bike<00:07:37.259> I<00:07:37.620> did

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:38.310 
and it was a very comfortable bike I did

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:40.040 
and it was a very comfortable bike I did
what<00:07:38.879> I<00:07:38.909> could<00:07:39.240> to<00:07:39.270> lower<00:07:39.599> it<00:07:39.810> because<00:07:39.960> I

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:40.050 
what I could to lower it because I

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:41.709 
what I could to lower it because I
honestly<00:07:40.169> didn't<00:07:40.680> like<00:07:40.830> the<00:07:41.009> sit-up<00:07:41.490> position

00:07:41.709 --> 00:07:41.719 
honestly didn't like the sit-up position

00:07:41.719 --> 00:07:43.939 
honestly didn't like the sit-up position
it<00:07:42.719> felt<00:07:43.020> like<00:07:43.080> I<00:07:43.229> should<00:07:43.259> have<00:07:43.529> been<00:07:43.710> leaning

00:07:43.939 --> 00:07:43.949 
it felt like I should have been leaning

00:07:43.949 --> 00:07:46.820 
it felt like I should have been leaning
when<00:07:44.520> I<00:07:44.550> really<00:07:44.939> wasn't

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:46.830
