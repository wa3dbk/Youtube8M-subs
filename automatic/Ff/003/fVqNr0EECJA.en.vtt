 buzz 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:47.750
 until you go to the other end I read you 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.450
 and I've heard you say that you do not have 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.430
 friends in the middle is impossible not because 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.930
 he does not have a friend he gave me a voice of 25-30 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.020
 You are every day, not because you do not have 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:01.840
 a friend from the middle 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:04.869
 I have to take it into account one day a 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.219
 journalist tells you a guy sir how to 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.500
 did to reach 100 years says no 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:12.599
 I argue with good people does not have to be 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.599
 that's why only and it should not be told 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:21.299
 I must have I say it of the question 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:27.999
 I'm not telling the truth that I do not know I have 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.889
 people that I love very much but I have a 

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:33.250
 have I'm going to open my heart since 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:36.639
 we are playing hard because my dad who 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.889
 today that 12 years ago yesterday he died 25 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:40.989
 always the day of the virgin is that 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:43.719
 Alzheimer's disease and there were many 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:46.209
 friends that he had he was saying 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:49.780
 Fantino example is my friend because he 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:51.299
 it distinguishes me he said and many friends do not 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.840
 they went to visit when he was 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:58.329
 This sick man and I must have 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.140
 there was something half common there 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:04.270
 resolved with this from what 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.220
 friendship yes if it does not give you the five 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.650
 liters blood no friendship 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.430
 then it gives a product valorization 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.750
 of a defect of a pac a ghost of mine 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.770
 and then I have that quilombo with the 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.870
 friendship for that reason I am very very lonely to the 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.520
 time to define friendship has happened to me 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.200
 the midachi tells me the crazy you do not know 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.340
 I say it here to have a 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.800
 relationship stronger than half 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:32.780
 economic of triples we are friends 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:34.370
 because it is a strong one did not say it if the 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.990
 title is a strong but not the fact 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.480
 one would believe that there was with the d with the 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.890
 Chinese 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.460
 brother and capable that we are brothers 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.930

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.750

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.210
 brothers overcomes the friend 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.400
 but you saw how he beat her we did not enter the 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.830
 disquisition I stayed that you love me which one 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:58.520
 is the difference you left loving is more than 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:01.130
 I want to know if you also but you saw 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.930
 leave for also that kind definition and 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.790
 that I am good in the term of the 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.310
 friendship you have it clear when you go a 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.230
 event and you come five or six of the stick 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.620
 and they tell you friend you do not know they are not 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.799
 friends 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.470
 but also when playing and I tell you 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.930
 there are people that I love a lot there are people 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.600
 I appreciate you, there are people with 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:25.940
 which he shared very nice things 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:28.840
 but friendship is something very 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:32.660
 very strong for me 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.819
 dignity and friendship is from her 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:38.030
 it's like more than love something like that 

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:40.759
 so I do not like to simplify it 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.410
