00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
dog in the video it's quite funny you

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.119 
dog in the video it's quite funny you
think<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:40.020> younger<00:00:40.230> dog<00:00:40.530> should<00:00:40.770> do<00:00:40.950> that

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
think the younger dog should do that

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.630 
think the younger dog should do that
right<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:42.530> obviously<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:43.950> thought<00:00:46.370> my<00:00:47.370> first

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
right and obviously I thought my first

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.690 
right and obviously I thought my first
thoughts<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.360> video<00:00:48.660> were<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.700> puppies

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
thoughts of the video were the puppies

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.229 
thoughts of the video were the puppies
did<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:51.239> they<00:00:51.600> got<00:00:51.750> into<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.050> garbage<00:00:52.260> and

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
did that they got into the garbage and

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.569 
did that they got into the garbage and
younger<00:00:54.239> dogs<00:00:54.449> gone<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.930> garbage<00:00:55.289> end

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.220 
younger dogs gone to the garbage end
made<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.730> big<00:00:56.910> mess<00:00:57.149> but<00:00:57.449> turned<00:00:57.960> out<00:00:58.170> that

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230
