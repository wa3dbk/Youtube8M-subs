arrested Stephanie right on the spot I

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.800 
arrested Stephanie right on the spot I
which<00:05:10.199> I<00:05:10.380> thought<00:05:10.590> was<00:05:10.710> a<00:05:10.800> classic<00:05:11.340> moment<00:05:11.810> I

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
which I thought was a classic moment I

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.360 
which I thought was a classic moment I
think<00:05:13.320> that's<00:05:13.800> going<00:05:14.310> to<00:05:14.370> be<00:05:15.139> you<00:05:16.139> know<00:05:16.370> really

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
think that's going to be you know really

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:22.120 
think that's going to be you know really
it's<00:05:17.880> my<00:05:18.180> mind<00:05:18.449> for<00:05:18.720> a<00:05:18.750> long<00:05:18.960> time<00:05:19.259> there<00:05:19.970> and

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
it's my mind for a long time there and

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.100 
it's my mind for a long time there and
so<00:05:23.130> this<00:05:23.250> that's<00:05:23.550> what<00:05:23.699> led<00:05:23.849> up<00:05:23.940> to<00:05:23.970> this

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
so this that's what led up to this

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.920 
so this that's what led up to this
of<00:05:25.380> course<00:05:25.590> Bri<00:05:25.919> lasts<00:05:26.669> this<00:05:27.150> past<00:05:27.389> Monday<00:05:27.659> she
