00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.639
 online this time we have the 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.289
 alfa romeo giulietta but before 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.900
 start let's take a look at the 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.820
 story in the centennial year the 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.610
 name pays tribute to an icon of 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.290
 automobile and a myth within the brand 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.269
 during the 50s the giulietta 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.160
 original allowed many enthusiasts 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:32.710
 of the brand access for the first time to a 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.330
 alfa romeo in the current giulietta 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.010
 competes within the segment of 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.470
 compact in which we find models 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.780
 like the volkswagen golf the lion seat the 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.820
 opel astra or the renault megane releases 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.829
 a completely new architecture that 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.989
 employs aluminum and ultra high steels 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.090
 resistance is also manufactured with 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.010
 avant-garde techniques but one step 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.100
 behind for example citroÃ«n that already 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.000
 employs laser welding is a new c4 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.039
 this new platform has 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.329
 very elaborate suspensions yes it is true 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:00.280
 that in the front train we found the 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.690
 typical mcpherson but it's in the butt 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.309
 where they have thrown the rest here 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.440
 we found an exquisite multibrazo 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.060
 own upper segments other 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.890
 feature of the new platform is 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.960
 the system of enea that already premiered the 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.119
 myth and that as in this is standard in 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.410
 the whole giulietta range but we have to 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.929
 look at the new dual direction 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.720
 has double pinion to understand us 

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:19.160
 that exists 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.050
 that decouple the address of the 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.670
 wheels with which by means of an engine 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.040
 electric allows to act on it 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.840
 getting it to be direct and precise 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.460
 but the truth is that they penalize the radio 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.020
 of spinning since we've talked about the dna 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.370
 tell you that it is located in the part 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.630
 low of the dashboard and that we can 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.670
 act on it in three modes of 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.230
 Driving system modifies cattail 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.540
 driving parameters such as 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.700
 engine and accelerator response the 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.770
 change management including differential 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.700
 Q2 electronic and control system 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.160
 of stability 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.970
 the version we tested is the 2.0 jd of 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.380
 170 hp engine is a 2.0 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.540
 four cylinders placed in position 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.460
 front cross that has the 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.330
 direct injection by common rail and turbo 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.369
 of variable geometry 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.460
 the multi jet system is second 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.460
 generation 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.830
 in terms of passive safety the alpha 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.210
 romeo has been concerned that the 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.130
 giulietta get 5 stars in the 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.380
 Euroncap tests have done this 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.910
 more than 15,000 hours of 150 calculations 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.310
 slide tests always more than 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.040
 components and 80 'crash test' 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.200
 They have adapted to hit the car 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.209
 at the controls of giulietta we find 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.500
 a very nice atmosphere and some 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.359
 Finishes that look like segment 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.040
 superior the suspensions of which 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:27.500
 we were talking before confirming a 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.030
 flawless behavior the car of 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.500
 trace the curves with tyralignals but 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.090
 we have to do it very well 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.340
 because any error in our 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.720
 driving makes it lose effectiveness 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.819
 touch of the address is exquisite 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.650
 it seems in rear-wheel drive something similar 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.989
 happens to the change the routes are 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.879
 a tad long but the accuracy is 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.469
 extraordinary that yes we are wishing 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:48.439
 test the clutch gearbox 

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:50.329
 double a new element of the dna is the 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:52.069
 pre- field system that acts on the 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:54.620
 brakes let's go to the jarama circuit 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:58.569
 to test the difference between the mode 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.569
 dynamic and normal mode when braking 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.860
 here we see the first braking with the 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:02.480
 Enea mode in dynamic position here 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:05.299
 we see where the giulietta has stopped 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:08.659
 with the position of the dna in normal 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:10.310
 the difference is more than remarkable for that 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:12.470
 it seems inexplicable to us that the new 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.569
 profile system only act in the mode 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.739
 dna's dynamic is something that we believe 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:17.739
 they would have to study in alfa romeo
