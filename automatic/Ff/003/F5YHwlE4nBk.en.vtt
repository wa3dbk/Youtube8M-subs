assembly<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.410> as<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.189> can<00:00:29.279> see<00:00:29.429> that<00:00:29.670> this

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
assembly and as you can see that this

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.889 
assembly and as you can see that this
little<00:00:30.840> plus<00:00:31.289> here<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:32.610> normally<00:00:33.059> vertical

little plus here is normally vertical
and<00:00:34.050> horizontal<00:00:34.079> but<00:00:35.010> right<00:00:35.190> now<00:00:35.309> it's<00:00:35.489> a

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
and horizontal but right now it's a

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.040 
and horizontal but right now it's a
little<00:00:35.640> bit<00:00:35.760> askew<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.480> basically<00:00:36.870> what<00:00:37.020> I

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
little bit askew and basically what I

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.690 
little bit askew and basically what I
did<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.530> pulled<00:00:37.920> out<00:00:38.040> every<00:00:38.250> one<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:38.550> these

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
did is I pulled out every one of these

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.510 
did is I pulled out every one of these
geared<00:00:39.149> pieces<00:00:40.079> center<00:00:40.410> pieces<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.980> I

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
geared pieces center pieces and I

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.420 
geared pieces center pieces and I
twisted<00:00:42.239> them<00:00:42.420> counterclockwise<00:00:42.980> one<00:00:43.980> tooth

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
twisted them counterclockwise one tooth

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.750 
twisted them counterclockwise one tooth
and<00:00:44.780> and<00:00:45.780> put<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.140> back<00:00:46.230> together<00:00:46.440> so<00:00:46.890> now<00:00:47.280> it's

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
and and put it back together so now it's

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.110 
and and put it back together so now it's
each<00:00:48.180> little<00:00:48.870> cross<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:49.500> askew<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.460> when<00:00:51.000> it's

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
each little cross is askew and when it's

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.700 
each little cross is askew and when it's
like<00:00:51.270> this<00:00:51.510> in<00:00:51.660> this<00:00:51.780> configuration<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.590> can

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
like this in this configuration you can

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.709 
like this in this configuration you can
see<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:52.949> doesn't<00:00:53.250> want<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.489> turn<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:54.030> won't<00:00:54.570> turn

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
see it doesn't want to turn I won't turn

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.560 
see it doesn't want to turn I won't turn
at<00:00:54.960> all<00:00:55.199> but<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:56.039> course<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.460> can<00:00:56.640> still<00:00:57.329> turn

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
at all but of course you can still turn

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.869 
at all but of course you can still turn
these<00:00:57.870> corners<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.500> when<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:58.770> do<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.850> can

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
these corners and when you do you can

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.810 
these corners and when you do you can
turn<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.660> center's<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:01.800> they<00:01:02.039> are<00:01:02.280> no

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
turn the center's so that they are no

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.160 
turn the center's so that they are no
longer<00:01:02.850> askew<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.660> they're<00:01:03.780> perfectly

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
longer askew and they're perfectly

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.170 
longer askew and they're perfectly
vertical<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.159> horizontal<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.760> then<00:01:06.000> the

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
vertical and horizontal and then the

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.289 
vertical and horizontal and then the
puzzle<00:01:06.510> will<00:01:06.600> turn<00:01:06.780> like<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:06.990> 2x2<00:01:07.610> so<00:01:08.610> doing

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
puzzle will turn like a 2x2 so doing

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.710 
puzzle will turn like a 2x2 so doing
this<00:01:09.750> alternate<00:01:10.729> assembly<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:12.030> does<00:01:12.360> make<00:01:12.600> the

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
this alternate assembly it does make the

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.050 
this alternate assembly it does make the
puzzle<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.140> little<00:01:13.530> bit<00:01:13.680> harder<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.100> solve<00:01:14.310> it

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
puzzle a little bit harder to solve it

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.999 
puzzle a little bit harder to solve it
doesn't<00:01:15.540> make<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:16.049> much<00:01:16.409> harder<00:01:16.619> but<00:01:16.860> it

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
doesn't make it that much harder but it

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.190 
doesn't make it that much harder but it
is<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.159> little<00:01:17.490> bit<00:01:17.610> harder<00:01:18.049> some<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.140> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
is a little bit harder some of the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.280 
is a little bit harder some of the
challenges<00:01:19.650> are<00:01:19.830> first<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:21.030> have<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.270> kind<00:01:22.229> of

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
challenges are first you have to kind of

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.830 
challenges are first you have to kind of
solve<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.740> puzzle<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.180> gets<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.659> this

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
solve the puzzle so that it gets to this

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.359 
solve the puzzle so that it gets to this
state<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.350> then<00:01:25.500> when<00:01:25.680> you're<00:01:25.830> here

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
state and then when you're here

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.210 
state and then when you're here
then<00:01:26.700> finally<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.479> can<00:01:28.439> flatten<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.890> puzzle

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
then finally you can flatten the puzzle

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.760 
then finally you can flatten the puzzle
out<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:30.030> anyway<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:30.869> think<00:01:31.020> it's<00:01:31.320> just<00:01:31.500> so

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
out and so anyway I think it's just so

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:32.600 
out and so anyway I think it's just so
cool

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
cool

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.460 
cool

anyway this is the David's gear cube and

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.359 
anyway this is the David's gear cube and
the<00:01:59.399> alternate<00:02:00.530> assembly<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.740> that's<00:02:02.250> pretty

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
the alternate assembly and that's pretty

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.490 
the alternate assembly and that's pretty
much<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:02.729> for<00:02:02.850> this<00:02:02.969> video<00:02:03.149> I<00:02:03.329> figured<00:02:03.810> you

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
much it for this video I figured you

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.959 
much it for this video I figured you
know<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.619> do<00:02:04.740> make<00:02:05.009> videos<00:02:05.040> at<00:02:05.490> least<00:02:05.520> every

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
know I do make videos at least every

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.570 
know I do make videos at least every
other<00:02:06.000> weekend<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.649> I've<00:02:07.649> been<00:02:07.979> doing<00:02:08.310> weekly

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
other weekend and I've been doing weekly

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.580 
other weekend and I've been doing weekly
videos<00:02:08.700> for<00:02:09.090> a<00:02:09.119> long<00:02:09.300> time<00:02:09.599> so<00:02:10.170> I<00:02:10.200> thought<00:02:10.530> I

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
videos for a long time so I thought I

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.770 
videos for a long time so I thought I
would<00:02:10.770> at<00:02:11.069> least<00:02:11.250> do<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.760> short<00:02:12.239> video<00:02:12.450> for<00:02:12.690> you

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
would at least do a short video for you

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.030 
would at least do a short video for you
guys<00:02:12.840> this<00:02:13.140> weekend

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.530 
guys this weekend
and<00:02:14.340> I<00:02:14.400> figure<00:02:14.670> a<00:02:14.700> short<00:02:14.970> video<00:02:15.150> is<00:02:15.330> better

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
and I figure a short video is better

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.420 
and I figure a short video is better
than<00:02:15.750> no<00:02:15.900> video<00:02:16.200> so<00:02:16.680> I<00:02:16.709> hope<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:17.040> guys<00:02:17.129> enjoyed
