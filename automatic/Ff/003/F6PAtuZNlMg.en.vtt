00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.130 

I<00:00:00.920> went<00:00:01.920> to<00:00:02.100> study<00:00:02.610> abroad<00:00:02.879> in<00:00:02.970> Squa<00:00:03.330> it's<00:00:03.689> two

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
I went to study abroad in Squa it's two

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.710 
I went to study abroad in Squa it's two
hours<00:00:04.259> away<00:00:04.410> from<00:00:04.920> Paris<00:00:05.430> it<00:00:05.940> made<00:00:06.390> me<00:00:06.509> realize

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
hours away from Paris it made me realize

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.259 
hours away from Paris it made me realize
that<00:00:07.040> annealing<00:00:08.040> is<00:00:08.189> universal<00:00:08.849> like<00:00:09.059> you<00:00:09.150> can

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
that annealing is universal like you can

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:10.970 
that annealing is universal like you can
take<00:00:09.420> any<00:00:09.719> engineering<00:00:10.110> class<00:00:10.290> any<00:00:10.469> country

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
take any engineering class any country

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.560 
take any engineering class any country
and<00:00:11.099> still<00:00:11.400> you<00:00:11.519> can<00:00:11.670> succeed<00:00:12.059> in<00:00:12.240> it<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:12.450> do

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
and still you can succeed in it and do

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.200 
and still you can succeed in it and do
up

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.810

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
automotive supplier company some of the

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.890 
automotive supplier company some of the
skills<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:58.309> definitely<00:00:59.309> gave<00:00:59.550> me<00:00:59.580> where<00:00:59.970> the

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
skills that definitely gave me where the

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.539 
skills that definitely gave me where the
ability<00:01:01.229> to<00:01:01.260> keep<00:01:01.409> track<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.830> a<00:01:01.920> lot<00:01:01.949> of<00:01:02.339> time

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:02.549 
ability to keep track of a lot of time

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:04.850 
ability to keep track of a lot of time
zones<00:01:02.580> at<00:01:03.059> once<00:01:03.269> I<00:01:03.720> was<00:01:04.049> in<00:01:04.199> Peru<00:01:04.409> for<00:01:04.680> two

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
zones at once I was in Peru for two

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.210 
zones at once I was in Peru for two
weeks<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.549> we<00:01:06.470> volunteered<00:01:07.470> in<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.920> village

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
weeks and we volunteered in a village

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.550 
weeks and we volunteered in a village
called<00:01:08.250> chapati<00:01:09.090> this<00:01:09.810> village<00:01:10.170> was<00:01:10.350> at<00:01:10.530> a

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
called chapati this village was at a

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.160 
called chapati this village was at a
very<00:01:10.890> high<00:01:11.460> elevation<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.360> very<00:01:12.600> remote

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
very high elevation in a very remote

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.760 
very high elevation in a very remote
area<00:01:13.549> so<00:01:14.549> we<00:01:14.670> got<00:01:14.820> there<00:01:15.060> by<00:01:15.299> hiking<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.590> way

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
area so we got there by hiking the way

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.250 
area so we got there by hiking the way
the<00:01:17.010> women<00:01:17.159> would<00:01:17.460> cook<00:01:17.670> food<00:01:17.970> was<00:01:18.330> just<00:01:18.690> burn

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
the women would cook food was just burn

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.530 
the women would cook food was just burn
wood<00:01:19.530> in<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.830> house<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.909> was<00:01:20.940> very<00:01:21.180> bad

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
wood in the house and that was very bad

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.330 
wood in the house and that was very bad
because<00:01:21.780> there's<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.170> very<00:01:22.350> small<00:01:22.440> enclosed

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
because there's a very small enclosed

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.400 
because there's a very small enclosed
area<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.330> was<00:01:24.390> basically<00:01:24.600> very<00:01:25.020> unhealthy

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:25.410 
area and it was basically very unhealthy

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.230 
area and it was basically very unhealthy
and<00:01:25.650> equivalent<00:01:26.190> to<00:01:26.250> smoking<00:01:26.400> 40<00:01:27.030> cigarettes

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
and equivalent to smoking 40 cigarettes

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.710 
and equivalent to smoking 40 cigarettes
a<00:01:27.510> day

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
a day

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.610 
a day
we<00:01:28.080> built<00:01:28.490> stoves<00:01:29.490> for<00:01:29.700> them<00:01:29.850> with<00:01:30.090> chimneys

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
we built stoves for them with chimneys

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.310 
we built stoves for them with chimneys
that<00:01:31.790> you<00:01:32.790> know<00:01:32.910> got<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.240> smoke<00:01:33.570> out<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.200> then

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
that you know got the smoke out and then

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.340 
that you know got the smoke out and then
we<00:01:34.530> had<00:01:34.800> the<00:01:35.070> chimneys<00:01:35.550> high<00:01:35.760> up<00:01:35.940> so<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.570> the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
we had the chimneys high up so that the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.140 
we had the chimneys high up so that the
embers<00:01:37.740> wouldn't<00:01:38.070> catch<00:01:38.220> on<00:01:38.370> to<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.790> straw

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
embers wouldn't catch on to the straw

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.750 
embers wouldn't catch on to the straw
and<00:01:39.450> burn<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:40.040> pot<00:01:41.040> while<00:01:41.280> we<00:01:41.400> were<00:01:41.520> there

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
and burn the pot while we were there

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.300 
and burn the pot while we were there
that<00:01:42.030> actually<00:01:42.270> happened<00:01:42.870> one<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.050> the<00:01:43.310> the

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
that actually happened one of the the

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.800 
that actually happened one of the the
kitchen<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.940> school<00:01:45.270> caught<00:01:45.450> on<00:01:45.600> fire

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
kitchen of the school caught on fire

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.630 
kitchen of the school caught on fire
because<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.470> stoves<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:46.920> they<00:01:47.130> had<00:01:47.370> so

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
because of the stoves that they had so

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.130 
because of the stoves that they had so
it<00:01:47.730> actually<00:01:47.910> validated<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.630> project<00:01:49.050> that

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
it actually validated the project that

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.430 
it actually validated the project that
we<00:01:49.260> were<00:01:49.380> doing<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.890> went<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:51.230> Imperial<00:01:52.230> College
