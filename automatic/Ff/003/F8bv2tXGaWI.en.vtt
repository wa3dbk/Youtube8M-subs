00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.970
 I have an appointment at paris cave in the 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.309
 6th district of Paris where françois 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.719
 surget oenologist experts agreed to 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.690
 we receive to deliver us some 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.490
 secrets about whiskey this balvenie us 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.490
 let's discover together this balvenie 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:25.080
 single barrel son post 12 years old and 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.820
 balbigny de belou 17 years old françois 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.099
 to go to the tasting of the back 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.349
 balvenie single barrel force it 12 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.669
 years and back balvenie of ball or 17 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.780
 years can you tell us about 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.730
 the history of this country 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.320
 yes of course the balvenie is 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.890
 certainly one of the oldest 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.899
 distillery of the kids 1892 but also 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.450
 still held by the same the same 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.820
 family the family grant 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:50.129
 we can not speak I would say two 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.920
 balvenie not to mention both drums 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.719
 of oak both stills but 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.270
 also maltsters doing a job 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.829
 remarkable simply because 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.960
 you have a meter of checks and everything to 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.489
 unique fact that is david stewart 's opinion 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.989
 stewart is definitely the best 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.530
 cellar master lycos at the moment 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.170
 and puts all in activity so as to 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.750
 what the distillery always come out 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.909
 products that are signed the 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.229
 balvenie with this side but what we 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.720
 love to find in this distillery 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.369
 with this candied fruit side also when 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.869
 also even in this distillery with 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.790
 different variants everything depends on 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.100
 ages 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.170
 françois we go to tasting then 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.870
 how do we appreciate a yes if like 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.130
 balvenie then first by its color the 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.110
 color is very important she we 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.790
 provides information on the age of whiskey 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.770
 can also the quality of the flows that we are going 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.350
 use so now we move on to 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.300
 another phase which is to smell the 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.340
 whiskey then had but the whiskey is fine 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.960
 to be to fetch all the flavors 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.660
 possible then there is no 36 solutions 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.120
 first you will spend your other 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.530
 born your nose raised and for 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.030
 really appreciate it at that moment 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.040
 that is to say really does not come out because 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.810
 all the aromas we will bring some 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.580
 relatively simple thing a few 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.960
 drops of water in the green and you go 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.200
 see that it's going to explode every 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.200
 aromas 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.979
 that's where we put the famous drop 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.530
 that's where we put a little drop 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.750
 water 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.240
 take your glass back to me and 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.069
 you put your nose on the glass and there 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.209
 you have bouquets that expresses itself 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.209
 quite simply 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.360
 a very nice bush length 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.190
 spoke just now we really 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.850
 something bulky something 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.470
 kader thing well certainly we have 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.170
 something that always has but we have 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.840
 really feel like having a product 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:45.830
 of great maturity and especially with its 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:50.530
 flavors his favors I would say the de 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:52.790
 fruit fruits not confessed very secret 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.460
 either for the tasting was seen 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.760
 now luis who consumes earlier 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:01.310
 as an aperitif at the end of the meal tips 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.130
 first for the aperitif I think the 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.110
 12 years old would be perfect on the elegance that 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.330
 can have and his finesse I think we 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.650
 would have something perfect for 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.320
 the aperitif that will prepare us 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.120
 in fact what to open the appetite after 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.650
 at the end of the meal why not this one 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.840
 as they say I stif 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.310
 it's okay it would be perfect 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.160
 finish a meal here is simply 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.770
 agree french thank you very much for 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.200
 all his advice and this welcome in paris 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.440
 cape 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.020
 but it's a pleasure 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.180
