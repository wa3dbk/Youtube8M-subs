00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.070 
to show you how to curl synthetic hair
one<00:00:14.490> of<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.670> things<00:00:14.940> that<00:00:15.150> I<00:00:15.179> actually<00:00:15.509> use

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
one of the things that I actually use

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.529 
one of the things that I actually use
it's<00:00:16.410> two<00:00:16.770> items<00:00:17.250> that<00:00:17.340> I<00:00:17.460> actually<00:00:17.760> use<00:00:18.240> and

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
it's two items that I actually use and

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.970 
it's two items that I actually use and
that<00:00:19.230> is<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.650> water<00:00:19.890> bottle<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:21.529> my<00:00:22.529> ceramic

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
that is the water bottle and my ceramic

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.070 
that is the water bottle and my ceramic
iron<00:00:25.699> so<00:00:26.699> what<00:00:26.880> I'm<00:00:27.000> going<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.210> do<00:00:27.420> first<00:00:27.869> is

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
iron so what I'm going to do first is

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.860 
iron so what I'm going to do first is
lightly<00:00:28.800> miss<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.550> hair<00:00:30.800> and<00:00:32.149> the<00:00:33.149> reason<00:00:33.600> is

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
lightly miss the hair and the reason is

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.100 
lightly miss the hair and the reason is
the<00:00:34.559> water<00:00:34.860> allows<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:36.059> barrier<00:00:36.540> acts<00:00:36.809> as<00:00:37.079> a

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
the water allows a barrier acts as a

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.860 
the water allows a barrier acts as a
barrier<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.520> detangle<00:00:41.719> making<00:00:42.719> sure

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
barrier and so I detangle making sure

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.170 
barrier and so I detangle making sure
that<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.140> distribute<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.860> water<00:00:44.160> evenly<00:00:44.789> on

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
that I distribute the water evenly on

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:51.549 
that I distribute the water evenly on
each<00:00:45.809> strand<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.500> hair<00:00:48.559> and<00:00:49.559> their<00:00:50.010> eye<00:00:50.219> part

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
each strand of hair and their eye part

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.130 
each strand of hair and their eye part
and<00:00:52.559> while<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.699> hair<00:00:53.969> is<00:00:54.180> still<00:00:54.570> slightly

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
and while the hair is still slightly

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.270 
and while the hair is still slightly
missed<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:56.360> will<00:00:57.360> take<00:00:57.600> my<00:00:57.870> iron<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.680> this<00:00:59.100> is

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
missed I will take my iron and this is

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.760 
missed I will take my iron and this is
synthetic<00:00:59.730> so<00:01:00.480> my<00:01:00.629> iron<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.109> about<00:01:01.410> at<00:01:01.739> a

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
synthetic so my iron is about at a

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.060 
synthetic so my iron is about at a
hundred<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.670> ten<00:01:03.149> degrees<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.960> I'm<00:01:04.830> not

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
hundred and ten degrees and I'm not

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.090 
hundred and ten degrees and I'm not
closing<00:01:05.460> down<00:01:05.700> tightly<00:01:06.500> so<00:01:07.500> I'm<00:01:07.650> going<00:01:07.920> to

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
closing down tightly so I'm going to

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.740 
closing down tightly so I'm going to
actually<00:01:08.840> hold<00:01:09.840> barely<00:01:10.470> hold<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.430> I'm

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
actually hold barely hold it and I'm

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.120 
actually hold barely hold it and I'm
barely<00:01:12.750> have<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.200> hair<00:01:13.500> through<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.860> iron

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
barely have the hair through the iron

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.999 
barely have the hair through the iron
and<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:15.330> just<00:01:15.600> hold<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:16.020> on<00:01:16.110> there<00:01:16.350> for<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.680> few

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
and I just hold it on there for a few

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.460 
and I just hold it on there for a few
seconds<00:01:18.020> and<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.590> get<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.830> curl<00:01:21.140> and<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.290> will

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
seconds and you get a curl and I will

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.670 
seconds and you get a curl and I will
move<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:23.040> next<00:01:23.310> one

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
move to the next one

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.289 
move to the next one
distributing<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.770> water<00:01:26.310> evenly<00:01:26.820> throughout

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
distributing the water evenly throughout

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.850 
distributing the water evenly throughout
the<00:01:27.420> strands<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.140> hair<00:01:30.140> my<00:01:31.140> temperature<00:01:31.590> is

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
the strands of hair my temperature is

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.359 
the strands of hair my temperature is
still<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.340> same<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:33.350> I'm<00:01:34.350> constantly<00:01:34.680> moving

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
still the same and I'm constantly moving

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.780 
still the same and I'm constantly moving
I<00:01:35.850> start<00:01:36.570> with<00:01:36.900> at<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.140> 45<00:01:37.740> degree<00:01:37.770> angle<00:01:38.579> and

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
I start with at a 45 degree angle and

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.690 
I start with at a 45 degree angle and
I'm<00:01:39.479> making<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.500> curl<00:01:42.619> and<00:01:43.619> then<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.220> just

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
I'm making that curl and then I just

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.039 
I'm making that curl and then I just
turned<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.570> iron<00:01:45.810> all<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.200> way<00:01:46.710> down<00:01:47.869> hold<00:01:48.869> it

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
turned the iron all the way down hold it

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.240 
turned the iron all the way down hold it
in<00:01:49.200> Justin<00:01:49.799> no<00:01:50.549> more<00:01:50.759> than<00:01:51.000> about<00:01:51.799> ten<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:53.040> nine

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
in Justin no more than about ten to nine

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.910 
in Justin no more than about ten to nine
