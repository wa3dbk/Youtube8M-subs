lobby on a game with American kids the
first<00:01:32.850> question<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.299> ask<00:01:33.450> true<00:01:34.200> or<00:01:34.290> false<00:01:34.320> the

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
first question I ask true or false the

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.990 
first question I ask true or false the
Earth<00:01:34.799> revolves<00:01:35.189> around<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.579> Sun<00:01:35.640> and

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
Earth revolves around the Sun and

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.460 
Earth revolves around the Sun and
ninety-five<00:01:36.479> percent<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:36.930> time<00:01:37.079> they<00:01:37.350> get

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
ninety-five percent of the time they get

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.230 
ninety-five percent of the time they get
that<00:01:37.650> wrong<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:38.070> I'm<00:01:38.189> just<00:01:38.400> throwing<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.119> out

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
that wrong so I'm just throwing it out

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.850 
that wrong so I'm just throwing it out
there<00:01:39.299> but<00:01:39.570> maybe<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.900> American<00:01:40.470> education

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
there but maybe the American education

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.630 
there but maybe the American education
system<00:01:41.280> isn't<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.820> best<00:01:42.350> anyway<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.640> think

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
system isn't the best anyway I think

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.490 
system isn't the best anyway I think
it's<00:01:44.820> pretty<00:01:44.909> cool<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.210> like<00:01:46.110> some<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.439> the

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
it's pretty cool that like some of the

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.109 
it's pretty cool that like some of the
things<00:01:46.710> here<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.220> can<00:01:47.460> dual<00:01:47.939> wield

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
things here that you can dual wield

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.120 
things here that you can dual wield
weapons<00:01:48.350> that<00:01:49.350> we've<00:01:49.500> always<00:01:49.680> been<00:01:49.860> able<00:01:49.979> to

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
weapons that we've always been able to

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.170 
weapons that we've always been able to
do<00:01:50.220> actually<00:01:50.549> no<00:01:50.610> we<00:01:50.700> haven't<00:01:50.880> been<00:01:50.939> able<00:01:51.000> to

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
do actually no we haven't been able to

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.899 
do actually no we haven't been able to
do<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.329> we<00:01:52.140> can<00:01:52.290> climb<00:01:52.530> trees<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:53.369> they'll

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
do that we can climb trees and they'll

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.569 
do that we can climb trees and they'll
be<00:01:54.000> deer<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.630> bears<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.079> animals<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.920> you

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
be deer and bears and animals and you

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.240 
be deer and bears and animals and you
can<00:01:56.759> hunt<00:01:57.000> them<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.649> I<00:01:58.649> think<00:01:58.920> it's<00:01:59.159> pretty

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
can hunt them and I think it's pretty

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.649 
can hunt them and I think it's pretty
cool<00:01:59.490> I<00:01:59.549> don't<00:01:59.820> think<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.270> don't<00:02:00.420> think<00:02:00.570> it's

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
cool I don't think I don't think it's

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.030 
cool I don't think I don't think it's
what<00:02:00.780> everyone<00:02:00.960> wanted<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:01.560> think<00:02:01.590> everyone

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
what everyone wanted I think everyone

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.649 
what everyone wanted I think everyone
wanted<00:02:02.310> this<00:02:02.399> series<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.850> end<00:02:02.880> on<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:04.040> on<00:02:05.040> the

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
wanted this series to end on the on the

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.660 
wanted this series to end on the on the
on<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.719> you<00:02:07.290> know<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.500> real<00:02:07.770> world<00:02:08.160> at<00:02:08.550> the

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
on the you know the real world at the

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.919 
on the you know the real world at the
current<00:02:09.000> moment<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.509> all<00:02:09.569> that<00:02:09.660> kind<00:02:09.869> of

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
current moment and all that kind of

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.960 
current moment and all that kind of
stuff<00:02:09.989> I<00:02:10.830> think<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.250> we<00:02:11.340> are<00:02:11.400> going<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.700> be<00:02:11.760> half

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
stuff I think it we are going to be half

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.320 
stuff I think it we are going to be half
and<00:02:12.150> half<00:02:12.300> I<00:02:12.420> think<00:02:12.450> it'll<00:02:12.690> be<00:02:12.720> half

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
and half I think it'll be half

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.900 
and half I think it'll be half
Desmond<00:02:13.750> and<00:02:13.930> half<00:02:14.170> Connor<00:02:14.980> apparently<00:02:15.820> his

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
Desmond and half Connor apparently his

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.980 
Desmond and half Connor apparently his
name<00:02:16.180> is<00:02:18.060> do<00:02:19.060> we<00:02:19.150> even<00:02:19.240> know<00:02:19.480> if<00:02:19.540> his<00:02:19.690> native

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
name is do we even know if his native

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.900 
name is do we even know if his native
american<00:02:20.410> or<00:02:20.560> are<00:02:20.650> we<00:02:20.740> just<00:02:20.770> all<00:02:21.190> assuming

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
american or are we just all assuming

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.280 
american or are we just all assuming
that<00:02:22.120> actually<00:02:22.510> let<00:02:22.600> me<00:02:22.660> scroll<00:02:22.960> down<00:02:23.170> I

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
that actually let me scroll down I

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.510 
that actually let me scroll down I
probably<00:02:23.470> should<00:02:23.650> have<00:02:23.740> studied<00:02:23.980> this<00:02:24.160> before

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
probably should have studied this before

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.590 
probably should have studied this before
I<00:02:24.550> talked<00:02:24.790> about<00:02:25.000> it<00:02:25.060> anyway<00:02:25.300> I<00:02:25.330> think<00:02:25.510> it's

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
I talked about it anyway I think it's

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.820 
I talked about it anyway I think it's
cool<00:02:25.750> i<00:02:25.810> really<00:02:25.900> like<00:02:26.200> Assassin's<00:02:26.590> Creed<00:02:26.800> I

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
cool i really like Assassin's Creed I

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:33.120 
cool i really like Assassin's Creed I
think<00:02:28.050> I<00:02:30.720> think<00:02:31.720> that<00:02:32.560> they<00:02:32.680> should<00:02:32.710> have<00:02:33.010> took

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
think I think that they should have took

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.640 
think I think that they should have took
two<00:02:33.310> years<00:02:33.340> of<00:02:33.610> development<00:02:34.000> time<00:02:34.590> instead<00:02:35.590> of

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
two years of development time instead of

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.560 
two years of development time instead of
one<00:02:35.890> I<00:02:36.130> think<00:02:36.310> Assassin's<00:02:36.760> Creed<00:02:37.000> is<00:02:37.270> a<00:02:37.300> great

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
one I think Assassin's Creed is a great

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.060 
one I think Assassin's Creed is a great
series<00:02:37.960> but<00:02:37.990> I<00:02:38.140> don't<00:02:38.320> think<00:02:38.530> it<00:02:38.620> deserves<00:02:38.920> to

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
series but I don't think it deserves to

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:40.410 
series but I don't think it deserves to
be<00:02:39.160> at<00:02:39.280> every<00:02:39.400> year<00:02:39.700> but<00:02:39.820> as<00:02:39.940> long<00:02:40.060> as<00:02:40.090> it<00:02:40.270> keep

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
be at every year but as long as it keep

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.730 
be at every year but as long as it keep
making<00:02:40.870> money<00:02:40.990> of<00:02:41.230> course<00:02:41.260> they're<00:02:41.560> going<00:02:41.680> to

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
making money of course they're going to

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.330 
making money of course they're going to
keep<00:02:41.830> bringing<00:02:42.130> it<00:02:42.190> out<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:44.230> more<00:02:45.190> to<00:02:45.250> that

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
keep bringing it out and more to that

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.490 
keep bringing it out and more to that
point<00:02:45.610> as<00:02:45.870> well<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:47.020> think<00:02:47.140> a<00:02:47.260> lot<00:02:47.380> of<00:02:47.410> people

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
point as well to think a lot of people

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.570 
point as well to think a lot of people
will<00:02:47.710> be<00:02:47.740> turned<00:02:47.980> off<00:02:48.130> by<00:02:48.160> this<00:02:48.370> because

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
will be turned off by this because

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.980 
will be turned off by this because
revelations<00:02:49.180> wasn't<00:02:49.450> the<00:02:49.510> best<00:02:49.630> game<00:02:49.840> like

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
revelations wasn't the best game like

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.420 
revelations wasn't the best game like
Assassin's<00:02:50.410> Creed<00:02:50.590> one<00:02:50.770> was<00:02:51.100> alright

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
Assassin's Creed one was alright

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.040 
Assassin's Creed one was alright
assassins<00:02:51.910> creed<00:02:52.090> two<00:02:52.150> was<00:02:52.390> fucking<00:02:52.810> amazing

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
assassins creed two was fucking amazing

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.020 
assassins creed two was fucking amazing
i<00:02:53.500> would<00:02:54.070> probably<00:02:54.160> put<00:02:54.340> that<00:02:54.520> my<00:02:54.640> top<00:02:54.700> five

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
i would probably put that my top five

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.699 
i would probably put that my top five
games<00:02:55.270> of<00:02:55.420> this<00:02:55.810> Jehol<00:02:56.110> generation

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
games of this Jehol generation

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.320 
games of this Jehol generation
Brotherhood<00:02:57.580> was<00:02:57.760> really<00:02:58.000> really<00:02:58.150> really

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
Brotherhood was really really really

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.330 
Brotherhood was really really really
good<00:02:58.600> and<00:02:58.810> revelations<00:02:59.650> was<00:02:59.830> just<00:03:00.070> more<00:03:00.310> of

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
good and revelations was just more of

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.550 
good and revelations was just more of
the<00:03:00.459> same<00:03:00.610> and<00:03:01.330> they<00:03:01.900> had<00:03:02.050> to<00:03:02.200> do<00:03:02.290> that<00:03:02.440> because

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
the same and they had to do that because

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.170 
the same and they had to do that because
obviously<00:03:02.800> they<00:03:03.130> had<00:03:03.250> to<00:03:03.430> hurry<00:03:03.940> up<00:03:04.000> and

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
obviously they had to hurry up and

what's<00:03:24.430> going<00:03:24.730> on<00:03:24.910> so<00:03:25.209> if<00:03:25.300> you<00:03:25.420> haven't<00:03:25.600> beat

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.960 
what's going on so if you haven't beat
them<00:03:26.170> all<00:03:26.320> good<00:03:27.040> luck<00:03:27.220> understanding<00:03:27.850> what's

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
them all good luck understanding what's

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.130 
them all good luck understanding what's
going<00:03:28.060> to<00:03:28.209> be<00:03:28.269> happening<00:03:28.300> number<00:03:28.810> three<00:03:28.989> but<00:03:29.110> I

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
going to be happening number three but I

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.570 
going to be happening number three but I
think<00:03:29.320> it's<00:03:29.410> a<00:03:29.470> cool<00:03:29.590> setting<00:03:29.830> lasers<00:03:30.190> this<00:03:30.489> is

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
think it's a cool setting lasers this is

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:31.860 
think it's a cool setting lasers this is
probably<00:03:30.760> why<00:03:31.000> like<00:03:31.209> Assassin's<00:03:31.630> Creed

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
probably why like Assassin's Creed

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.680 
probably why like Assassin's Creed
because<00:03:32.620> other<00:03:33.130> games<00:03:33.459> can<00:03:33.700> take<00:03:33.910> you<00:03:34.090> back<00:03:34.390> in

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.800 
because other games can take you back in
time<00:03:34.750> our<00:03:35.410> world<00:03:35.769> war<00:03:35.950> two<00:03:36.130> games<00:03:36.459> or<00:03:36.880> prince

awesome game I don't know what the
American<00:03:59.980> Revolution<00:04:00.459> is<00:04:00.930> that's<00:04:01.930> one

American Revolution is that's one

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.650 
American Revolution is that's one
problem<00:04:02.739> i<00:04:03.130> think<00:04:03.610> the<00:04:03.730> american<00:04:03.790> revolution

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
problem i think the american revolution

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.430 
problem i think the american revolution
is<00:04:04.870> when<00:04:05.350> the<00:04:06.040> british<00:04:06.670> were<00:04:06.880> fighting<00:04:07.390> the

is when the british were fighting the
Americans<00:04:08.440> I<00:04:10.739> think<00:04:11.739> or<00:04:12.010> was<00:04:12.250> the<00:04:12.519> American

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940

Americans I think or was the American
Revolution<00:04:13.480> the<00:04:13.600> one<00:04:13.750> where<00:04:13.989> the<00:04:14.110> Indians

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410
