00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:04.850
 how can I replace this heavy and used business 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:05.569
 Academy 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:06.830
 matters here 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.289
 and that's why nobody 

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:11.860
 it's basically me you add some 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.609
 products in the 

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:16.769
 for example that we usually call additives these additives 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.949
 when added you reduce the amount of water in the mixture from 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.430
 you can reduce the amount of water you 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.219
 resistance to concrete compression is basically this 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.390
 additives and some 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.490
 m products also that you can add in such a way you fill 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.720
 spaces delivery connected kids aggregates kids and cement 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.410
 It's like having exposed organic ones that we usually say for example 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.970
 microsilica just so you have an idea this material it has a surface 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.970
 prices are every gram 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.350
 a grass is 20 square meters you can 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.980
 a drama of this material is a violent person indeed he is much thinner 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:06.970
 than cement 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.840
 I joined the cd to fill these spaces 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.969
 which exist between the grain between the degree of aggregate cement gringo river 

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:15.570
 me 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.490
 and fill the concrete areas of the crust resistance of the concrete if you 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.090
 stop at the construction site talk to the owner of the house talk to the masons 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.940
 with the master of works because these exits are more and more modern 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:27.990
 technological 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.550
 are still not being employed in the work with 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.770
 only there is the price this is also more expensive than the straight unemployed 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.340
 opposed to speaking louder 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.340
 it's up to you to take a time to absorb this technology 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.710
 due to economic viability 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.540
 which represents a further cost 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.280
 there is a time d 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.799
 for people to get to the market at an affordable price 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.280
 you just bring us two examples here of what is used today in 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.909
 construction 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.859
 of what is technologically durable is the delivery of 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:02.530
 employees 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.340
 There are those who pull the teles to catch the one who does not love 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.510
 her house maybe taken there the lady heads being now released this year 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:11.260
 now it might be worth having put 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.910
 the roof of your house may be clay that meets cement 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:20.499
 is that segment she supports that hail rain 

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:23.849
 she is a little heavier she is also much more resistant 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.159
 It is also a little more expensive this already the delivery of Brazil a few decades in the 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:29.599
 in the delivery 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:30.730
 and what the future is 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.299
 highlight where we are going to evolve 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:37.969
 Today, this technology is still 

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:39.940
 al 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.740
 he identifies provide superior thermal comfort of the tile of 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.019
 mud started badly 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:46.829
 superior resistance 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.639
 her body weight to less per square meter take advantage to give more 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:51.090
 Light 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.150
 exactly it takes the much less consumes the structure of 2009 there was blowing 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.830
 enduring the ready-to-goal weight is very surprised to speak that it was up to speed 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.660
 I'm not going to have to answer twice so we can deal with so many 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.700
 I'll tell you the truth, I'll show you. 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.190
 astonished and what the future of the yew is the traquejo of what you used to concilia 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.830
 your home and if the same in 50 to 60 years 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.300
 and the capture of solar energy that today is already law in many cities 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.250
 you with your accountant even wonder why it is 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.560
 that the country counts on when it becomes scrap because that is not recycled 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.739
 this is a new market that has just come 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.790
 construction image that would have been centuries and still does not dry the 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.060
 right stuff explain to me what it is that would have doubles we have there in the corner 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.120
 that is an example of a capture board only there is not used for 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.060
 what cements to talk about 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.909
 the industry lists 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:45.399
 ditta this was already somewhat popular 'in Brazil 

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:50.829
 incredible that it seems in Brazil only to a point 78% of the work of the 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:54.959
 buildings use it crazy although popular in Egypt just under 2% 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:57.439
 less than 2% 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:00.859
 is that this is applied in that way insulated roof 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:03.859
 on the closed bottom in the areas where it has information 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:08.240
 in an angle of sunshine so come on you've already been there 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.550
 in front of a house that there was a solar pickup plate this one is 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.350
 a clipping of the vehicle plate 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.209
 just for you to see how it works 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.939
 explains what each of these Pakistanis are 

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:21.569
 Why do you have there with streamers, right? 

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:26.179
 after the circulation of the air now if it happens every year within yours 

00:04:26.179 --> 00:04:28.729
 Pipes here is the color cadu 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:30.620
 exactly he goes there 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.060
 and then make connection with the boiler that receives hot water france circulation 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.740
 Are you going to try every person? 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.039
 I want to know in a little while 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:40.699
 restless from here 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:44.460
 will probably be replaced by something that I have that they love us very much 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.419
 bigger 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:46.460
 weird 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.090
 We'll know what it is. 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.970
 in a minute 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.770
 Armed with me, please, please. 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.770
 we still talk about concrete bricks 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.020
 the solar heating plate why now I want to show you how the 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.909
 Superman 

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:02.900
 depression leprosy powers a little machine in england 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.240
 she stays at the airport but it seems to us nothing with that country x by which you 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.229
 is accustomed to passing 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:13.770
 the passenger in financing magnetic event reserves with levels 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.110
 of radiation considered blind 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.279
 in a computer screen the three-dimensional image show the person's body 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:25.330
 the airport officials said that everything is anonymous and the images 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.009
 are destroyed after checking 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:31.930
 the equipment is sensitive to silicone implant ipi other types of 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:32.870
 prostheses 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:38.040
 many people complain because the genital parts are also exposed and despite 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:43.169
 dressing will be an alternative to the 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:47.540
 passengers who do not like to be searched by security guards and should be 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.540
 more efficiently possible terrorist attacks 

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:56.189
 Give it to yourself, you have to use this as a warm montaner tube if you come back. 

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:59.189
 here a polemic out there that he knows if it will fall and here in Brazil 

00:05:59.809 --> 00:06:01.159
 I'll be there soon 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:04.699
 We're going to pro break time, enjoy this time to stay with us. 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:09.399
 more and more fans coming back with presents for you botafogo-rj come on 

00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:12.629
 give tips for its construction and I will also interview one of you by skype 

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:14.999
 What will today be from which part of Brazil? 

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:15.509
 stay with god
