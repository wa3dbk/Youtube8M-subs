00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
three practice sessions in real life

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.970 
three practice sessions in real life
into<00:03:29.820> this<00:03:30.030> one<00:03:30.350> session<00:03:31.350> that<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.620> game<00:03:31.800> has

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
into this one session that the game has

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.190 
into this one session that the game has
to<00:03:32.100> offer<00:03:32.130> a<00:03:32.340> shame<00:03:32.760> that<00:03:32.790> it's<00:03:33.690> the<00:03:33.810> only<00:03:34.050> time

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
to offer a shame that it's the only time

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.390 
to offer a shame that it's the only time
really<00:03:34.530> i<00:03:34.560> think<00:03:34.650> i've<00:03:34.890> actually<00:03:35.010> missed

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
really i think i've actually missed

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.340 
really i think i've actually missed
three<00:03:35.670> practice<00:03:36.060> sessions<00:03:36.450> but<00:03:36.690> i<00:03:36.930> hope<00:03:37.200> we

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
three practice sessions but i hope we

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:38.960 
three practice sessions but i hope we
can<00:03:37.530> cram<00:03:37.800> as<00:03:37.950> much<00:03:38.100> into<00:03:38.550> the<00:03:38.640> one-hour

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
can cram as much into the one-hour

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.850 
can cram as much into the one-hour
session<00:03:39.360> as<00:03:39.450> possible<00:03:39.930> without<00:03:40.410> making<00:03:40.800> it

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
session as possible without making it

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.229 
session as possible without making it
ridiculously<00:03:41.370> long<00:03:41.519> and<00:03:41.730> boring<00:03:41.850> for<00:03:42.180> you

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
ridiculously long and boring for you

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
guys be I don't know how that will work

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.729 
guys be I don't know how that will work
with<00:03:45.269> tyre<00:03:45.570> allocation<00:03:46.140> and<00:03:46.260> timing<00:03:46.620> and
