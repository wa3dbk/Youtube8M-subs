00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
field of scheme today I'm going to talk

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.340 
field of scheme today I'm going to talk
to<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.340> about<00:00:53.430> mounting<00:00:54.060> bindings<00:00:54.420> okay<00:00:55.140> when

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
to you about mounting bindings okay when

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.620 
to you about mounting bindings okay when
it<00:00:55.440> comes<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.739> mounting<00:00:55.890> bindings<00:00:56.489> it's<00:00:57.210> very

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:57.630 
it comes to mounting bindings it's very

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.900 
it comes to mounting bindings it's very
dependent<00:00:57.870> on<00:00:58.230> which<00:00:58.380> skis<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.800> buy<00:00:59.010> if<00:00:59.309> you

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
dependent on which skis you buy if you

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.540 
dependent on which skis you buy if you
get<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.059> freestyle<00:01:00.570> set<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:00.960> skis<00:01:01.680> you'll

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
get a freestyle set of skis you'll

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.520 
get a freestyle set of skis you'll
generally<00:01:02.880> get<00:01:03.180> asked<00:01:03.570> which<00:01:03.870> point<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.379> want

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
generally get asked which point you want

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.050 
generally get asked which point you want
the<00:01:04.589> amount<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:04.979> this<00:01:05.339> confuses<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.939> lot

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
the amount of that this confuses a lot

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.760 
the amount of that this confuses a lot
of<00:01:06.210> people<00:01:06.299> as<00:01:06.750> they<00:01:07.229> don't<00:01:07.350> know<00:01:07.560> there's

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
of people as they don't know there's

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.530 
of people as they don't know there's
different<00:01:08.100> mounting<00:01:08.430> points<00:01:08.700> if<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.329> have<00:01:09.509> a

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
different mounting points if you have a

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.749 
different mounting points if you have a
look<00:01:09.659> at<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.869> ski<00:01:10.049> over<00:01:10.229> here<00:01:10.430> you<00:01:11.430> can<00:01:11.579> see

look at the ski over here you can see

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:13.100 
look at the ski over here you can see
all<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.060> different<00:01:12.329> mounting<00:01:12.630> points<00:01:12.899> on<00:01:12.990> the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
all the different mounting points on the

all the different mounting points on the
ski<00:01:13.670> each<00:01:14.670> mounting<00:01:15.209> point<00:01:15.450> will<00:01:15.929> suggest<00:01:16.380> a

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
ski each mounting point will suggest a

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.410 
ski each mounting point will suggest a
different<00:01:16.740> type<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.159> skiing<00:01:17.549> we<00:01:18.209> have<00:01:18.299> the

out<00:01:39.270> there<00:01:39.509> basically<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:40.859> mounting<00:01:41.189> point

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
out there basically this mounting point

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:43.730 
out there basically this mounting point
is<00:01:41.549> dead<00:01:41.880> center<00:01:42.209> of<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.630> ski<00:01:42.840> this<00:01:43.439> allows

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:54.719 
riding up to jumps backwards so you can

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:57.199 
riding up to jumps backwards so you can

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
mountain skis and it's very important

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:02.120 
mountain skis and it's very important
that<00:02:00.599> you<00:02:00.689> have<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.869> binding<00:02:01.319> that's<00:02:01.709> suitable

settings of the ski it will basically

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.440 
settings of the ski it will basically
determine<00:02:21.220> how<00:02:22.220> much<00:02:22.400> pressure<00:02:22.670> is<00:02:22.909> needed<00:02:23.090> on

there<00:02:33.110> are<00:02:33.200> two<00:02:33.349> types<00:02:33.680> of<00:02:33.910> mounting<00:02:34.910> we<00:02:35.870> have

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
there are two types of mounting we have

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.220 
there are two types of mounting we have
a<00:02:36.019> drill<00:02:36.290> mount<00:02:36.440> and<00:02:36.769> a<00:02:37.400> rail<00:02:37.610> mount<00:02:38.049> as<00:02:39.049> you

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
a drill mount and a rail mount as you

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.199 
a drill mount and a rail mount as you
can<00:02:39.349> see<00:02:39.530> the<00:02:40.010> rail<00:02:40.190> mount<00:02:40.430> has<00:02:40.670> a<00:02:40.700> plate<00:02:40.970> and

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
can see the rail mount has a plate and

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.740 
can see the rail mount has a plate and
built<00:02:41.480> into<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:42.049> ski<00:02:43.120> this<00:02:44.120> is<00:02:44.329> so<00:02:44.480> when<00:02:44.660> the

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
built into the ski this is so when the

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.270 
built into the ski this is so when the
binding<00:02:45.140> is<00:02:45.230> mounted<00:02:45.620> to<00:02:45.650> the<00:02:45.769> ski<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.250> whole

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
binding is mounted to the ski the whole

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.580 
binding is mounted to the ski the whole
ski<00:02:46.730> can<00:02:46.910> flex<00:02:47.180> it<00:02:47.629> will<00:02:47.780> not<00:02:47.959> be<00:02:48.079> a<00:02:48.110> dead<00:02:48.319> point

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
ski can flex it will not be a dead point

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.530 
ski can flex it will not be a dead point
on<00:02:48.739> that<00:02:48.829> ski<00:02:49.099> because<00:02:49.819> there's<00:02:50.150> no<00:02:50.299> screws

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
on that ski because there's no screws

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.619 
on that ski because there's no screws
going<00:02:50.780> into<00:02:51.079> it<00:02:51.819> with<00:02:52.819> a<00:02:52.879> drill<00:02:53.120> mount<00:02:53.299> we

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:53.629 
going into it with a drill mount we

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:56.589 
going into it with a drill mount we
drill<00:02:53.900> right<00:02:54.319> into<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:54.859> base<00:02:55.209> fire<00:02:56.209> a<00:02:56.239> jig

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
drill right into the base fire a jig

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.710 
drill right into the base fire a jig
over<00:02:56.890> here<00:02:57.890> so<00:02:58.730> we<00:02:58.819> can<00:02:58.910> get<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.060> bindings<00:02:59.450> to

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
over here so we can get the bindings to

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.580 
over here so we can get the bindings to
sit<00:02:59.930> where<00:03:00.170> we<00:03:00.290> want<00:03:00.470> them<00:03:00.620> to<00:03:00.650> sit<00:03:02.590> when

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
sit where we want them to sit when

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.000 
sit where we want them to sit when
choosing<00:03:04.370> which<00:03:04.940> system<00:03:05.420> to<00:03:05.629> have<00:03:05.810> a<00:03:06.140> lot<00:03:06.950> of

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
choosing which system to have a lot of

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.860 
choosing which system to have a lot of
the<00:03:07.069> time<00:03:07.280> it's<00:03:07.519> determines<00:03:08.030> on<00:03:08.209> which<00:03:08.599> Keys

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
the time it's determines on which Keys

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.979 
the time it's determines on which Keys
you<00:03:09.079> buy<00:03:09.260> and<00:03:09.530> my<00:03:10.489> skis<00:03:10.790> will<00:03:11.239> come<00:03:11.540> with

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
you buy and my skis will come with

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.309 
you buy and my skis will come with
either<00:03:12.200> a<00:03:12.319> rail<00:03:12.590> or<00:03:12.829> as<00:03:13.160> a<00:03:13.190> drill<00:03:13.519> mount<00:03:13.640> and

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
either a rail or as a drill mount and

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.809 
either a rail or as a drill mount and
some<00:03:15.319> will<00:03:15.470> come<00:03:15.590> with<00:03:15.769> a<00:03:15.799> choice<00:03:16.040> but<00:03:16.519> this<00:03:16.669> is

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
some will come with a choice but this is

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:21.970 
some will come with a choice but this is
very<00:03:17.030> rare

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.220 

once<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.190> bindings<00:03:23.610> are<00:03:24.240> on<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.660> skis<00:03:24.900> you

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
once the bindings are on the skis you

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.260 
once the bindings are on the skis you
need<00:03:26.010> to<00:03:26.130> make<00:03:26.340> sure<00:03:26.370> that<00:03:26.850> the<00:03:26.940> forward

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
need to make sure that the forward

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.780 
need to make sure that the forward
pressure<00:03:27.480> is<00:03:27.720> correct<00:03:28.020> of<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.320> ski<00:03:28.530> and<00:03:28.790> this

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
pressure is correct of the ski and this

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.440 
pressure is correct of the ski and this
is<00:03:29.910> done<00:03:30.090> differently<00:03:30.510> by<00:03:30.780> each<00:03:30.840> binding<00:03:31.590> and

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
is done differently by each binding and

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.970 
is done differently by each binding and
unlocked<00:03:33.450> bindings<00:03:33.930> there's<00:03:34.140> a<00:03:34.230> screw<00:03:34.500> on<00:03:34.800> the

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
unlocked bindings there's a screw on the

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.180 
unlocked bindings there's a screw on the
back<00:03:35.130> that<00:03:35.460> needs<00:03:35.550> to<00:03:35.700> be<00:03:35.790> adjusted<00:03:36.000> and<00:03:37.190> on

back that needs to be adjusted and on
some<00:03:38.700> ski<00:03:38.970> you<00:03:39.180> might<00:03:39.360> have<00:03:39.510> a<00:03:39.540> window<00:03:40.020> with<00:03:40.650> a

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
some ski you might have a window with a

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.930 
some ski you might have a window with a
line<00:03:40.950> in<00:03:41.100> the<00:03:41.160> middle<00:03:41.430> that<00:03:41.460> needs<00:03:41.760> to<00:03:41.910> be

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
line in the middle that needs to be

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.370 
line in the middle that needs to be
sitting<00:03:42.390> in<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:42.540> middle<00:03:42.840> or<00:03:43.050> there<00:03:43.230> might<00:03:43.350> be

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
sitting in the middle or there might be

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.100 
sitting in the middle or there might be
an<00:03:43.590> arrow<00:03:43.800> that<00:03:44.070> needs<00:03:44.250> to<00:03:44.340> be<00:03:44.400> pointed<00:03:44.610> to

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
an arrow that needs to be pointed to

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.660 
an arrow that needs to be pointed to
this<00:03:46.110> is<00:03:46.350> very<00:03:46.440> important<00:03:47.130> because<00:03:47.370> it<00:03:47.520> also

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
this is very important because it also

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.420 
this is very important because it also
determines<00:03:48.270> how<00:03:48.450> your<00:03:48.600> ski<00:03:48.840> will<00:03:49.770> be<00:03:50.100> released

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
determines how your ski will be released

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.510 
determines how your ski will be released
from<00:03:50.610> your<00:03:50.760> boot<00:03:51.830> when<00:03:52.830> having<00:03:53.190> your<00:03:53.280> skis
