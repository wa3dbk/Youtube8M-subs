broiler<00:00:18.000> chicks<00:00:18.359> change<00:00:18.600> practice<00:00:19.020> so<00:00:19.350> let's

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
broiler chicks change practice so let's

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.150 
broiler chicks change practice so let's
get<00:00:19.650> on<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:19.920> job<00:00:21.289> and<00:00:22.289> basically<00:00:22.710> me<00:00:23.039> on

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
get on to the job and basically me on

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:38.840 
get on to the job and basically me on
firefox<00:00:23.550> aside<00:00:24.140> it's<00:00:25.140> mine

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.810 

so<00:00:39.449> choose<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.930> synchronic<00:00:40.320> listen<00:00:41.010> i'm

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
so choose the synchronic listen i'm

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.009 
so choose the synchronic listen i'm
gonna<00:00:41.879> be<00:00:42.090> using<00:00:42.120> ash<00:00:42.510> ash<00:00:42.719> might<00:00:44.809> want<00:00:45.809> to

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:46.019 
gonna be using ash ash might want to

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:51.349 
gonna be using ash ash might want to
increase<00:00:46.620> itself<00:00:47.070> at<00:00:47.219> a<00:00:47.250> difference<00:00:50.359> so

00:00:51.349 --> 00:00:51.359 
increase itself at a difference so

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:57.980 
increase itself at a difference so
synchronous

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:57.990 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.080 

well<00:00:58.620> basically<00:00:59.070> going<00:00:59.310> to<00:00:59.370> decrease<00:00:59.820> its

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
well basically going to decrease its

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:18.200 
well basically going to decrease its
attack<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:01.170> won't<00:01:01.410> take<00:01:01.560> much<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.770> damage<00:01:02.280> or

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.820 

you<00:01:18.750> don't<00:01:18.900> have<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.170> use<00:01:19.290> strong<00:01:19.620> wish

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
you don't have to use strong wish

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:27.560 
you don't have to use strong wish
purchased<00:01:20.280> relief<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:20.640> is<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:26.300> the<00:01:27.300> more<00:01:27.510> you

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
purchased relief it is and the more you

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.500 
purchased relief it is and the more you
are<00:01:27.960> decreased<00:01:28.590> attack<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.580> more<00:01:29.850> chances<00:01:30.390> of

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
are decreased attack the more chances of

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:37.870 
are decreased attack the more chances of
missing<00:01:31.340> sync<00:01:32.340> way

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.870 

it<00:01:38.420> might<00:01:38.750> not<00:01:38.899> miss<00:01:39.290> out<00:01:39.560> cheaper<00:01:39.979> actually

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
it might not miss out cheaper actually

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.660 
it might not miss out cheaper actually
on<00:01:41.149> Cinco<00:01:41.899> de<00:01:42.020> in<00:01:42.140> groups<00:01:42.320> of<00:01:42.530> five<00:01:42.860> is

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
on Cinco de in groups of five is

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.370 
on Cinco de in groups of five is
accuracy<00:01:44.180> of<00:01:44.329> synchrony<00:01:44.750> gotta<00:01:44.960> quit<00:01:45.200> her

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
accuracy of synchrony gotta quit her

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.160 
accuracy of synchrony gotta quit her
purse<00:01:45.619> it<00:01:45.799> so<00:01:46.369> there's<00:01:47.270> only<00:01:47.450> one<00:01:47.720> checks<00:01:48.020> in

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
purse it so there's only one checks in

00:01:48.170 --> 00:02:02.960 
purse it so there's only one checks in
every<00:01:48.259> four<00:01:48.680> to<00:01:48.710> get<00:01:48.920> us

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.840 

so<00:02:03.600> we<00:02:04.200> decreased<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.920> fiscal<00:02:05.340> track<00:02:05.640> and

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
so we decreased of fiscal track and

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.450 
so we decreased of fiscal track and
admit<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.660> the<00:02:06.750> time<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.350> minus<00:02:07.650> 50<00:02:07.980> so<00:02:08.250> let's

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
admit to the time to minus 50 so let's

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:20.690 
admit to the time to minus 50 so let's
just<00:02:08.850> keep<00:02:09.030> on<00:02:09.210> depreciated<00:02:09.869> in<00:02:10.080> Baghdad

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.710 

so<00:02:21.300> clean<00:02:21.510> back<00:02:21.720> dead<00:02:22.430> so<00:02:23.430> um<00:02:23.730> let's<00:02:24.270> keep<00:02:24.599> on

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
so clean back dead so um let's keep on

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:55.800 
so clean back dead so um let's keep on
using<00:02:24.900> shy<00:02:25.260> smile

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.770 

so<00:02:56.440> one

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.050 

so<00:03:00.780> we<00:03:00.959> still<00:03:01.230> need<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.069> keep<00:03:02.280> decreasing<00:03:02.519> then

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
so we still need to keep decreasing then

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.709 
so we still need to keep decreasing then
attacks<00:03:04.010> then<00:03:05.010> I'm<00:03:05.219> after<00:03:05.549> like<00:03:06.299> the<00:03:06.329> normal

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:06.719 
attacks then I'm after like the normal

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:08.449 
attacks then I'm after like the normal
attacks<00:03:07.170> put<00:03:07.499> too<00:03:07.620> much<00:03:07.769> more<00:03:08.069> dots<00:03:08.249> equals

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
attacks put too much more dots equals

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.399 
attacks put too much more dots equals
then<00:03:09.209> you<00:03:09.329> gotta<00:03:09.510> just<00:03:09.569> keep<00:03:09.959> on<00:03:10.139> increasing

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:10.409 
then you gotta just keep on increasing

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:13.160 
then you gotta just keep on increasing
it<00:03:10.709> fits<00:03:11.010> so<00:03:11.310> is<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.510> sequel<00:03:12.810> is<00:03:12.930> on<00:03:13.049> you're

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:18.379 
is just let me see man attacks fish um

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:21.050 
is just let me see man attacks fish um
you're<00:03:19.379> not<00:03:19.409> going<00:03:19.650> to<00:03:19.739> bikaner<00:03:20.189> okay<00:03:20.909> let's

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
you're not going to bikaner okay let's

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.690 
you're not going to bikaner okay let's
just<00:03:21.209> weaker<00:03:21.950> you<00:03:22.950> can't<00:03:23.219> increase<00:03:23.489> the

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
just weaker you can't increase the

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.789 
just weaker you can't increase the
elemental<00:03:24.090> difference<00:03:24.420> of<00:03:24.599> our<00:03:25.079> only<00:03:25.319> hope<00:03:25.620> is

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
elemental difference of our only hope is

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:41.910 
elemental difference of our only hope is
the<00:03:26.010> physical<00:03:26.370> damage

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.920 

you<00:03:42.920> understand<00:03:43.520> me<00:03:43.550> bata<00:03:43.880> or<00:03:44.030> minus<00:03:44.540> in<00:03:44.690> a<00:03:44.750> lot

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
you understand me bata or minus in a lot

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.620 
you understand me bata or minus in a lot
so<00:03:45.650> we<00:03:45.740> can<00:03:45.890> do<00:03:46.010> it<00:03:46.130> we<00:03:46.310> can<00:03:46.730> do<00:03:46.910> anything<00:03:47.060> we

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
so we can do it we can do anything we

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.810 
so we can do it we can do anything we
can't<00:03:48.260> exactly<00:03:48.470> the<00:03:48.890> green<00:03:49.130> do<00:03:49.340> and<00:03:49.670> my

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
can't exactly the green do and my

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.670 
can't exactly the green do and my
defensive<00:03:50.570> Nov<00:03:50.870> decrease<00:03:51.200> there's<00:03:51.470> a<00:03:51.530> long

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
defensive Nov decrease there's a long

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:58.150 
defensive Nov decrease there's a long
long<00:03:52.070> way<00:03:52.280> to<00:03:52.310> be<00:03:52.520> three<00:03:56.500> now<00:03:57.500> we<00:03:57.560> have<00:03:57.800> spectra

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
long way to be three now we have spectra

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.010 
long way to be three now we have spectra
so<00:03:58.340> let's<00:03:58.520> just<00:03:58.760> see<00:03:58.940> what<00:03:59.180> we<00:03:59.450> do<00:03:59.630> okay<00:03:59.780> we're

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.020 
so let's just see what we do okay we're

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.200 
so let's just see what we do okay we're
going<00:04:00.140> to<00:04:00.200> use<00:04:00.350> a<00:04:00.380> fever<00:04:00.850> so<00:04:01.850> just<00:04:02.030> use<00:04:02.180> a
