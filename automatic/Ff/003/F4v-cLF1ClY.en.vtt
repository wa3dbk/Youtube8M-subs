00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
come all the way down and so from here I

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.600 
come all the way down and so from here I
want<00:02:36.730> to<00:02:36.850> do<00:02:37.030> it<00:02:37.950> somewhere<00:02:38.950> where<00:02:39.010> it

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
want to do it somewhere where it

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.270 
want to do it somewhere where it
wouldn't<00:02:39.850> be<00:02:40.030> disturbed<00:02:40.180> by<00:02:40.510> or<00:02:41.440> this<00:02:41.920> so<00:02:42.250> i

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
wouldn't be disturbed by or this so i

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.229 
wouldn't be disturbed by or this so i
made<00:02:42.610> this<00:02:43.569> rich<00:02:44.410> sort<00:02:45.400> of<00:02:45.430> thing<00:02:45.610> across<00:02:45.940> the

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
made this rich sort of thing across the

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.420 
made this rich sort of thing across the
water<00:02:46.510> and<00:02:46.780> then<00:02:47.290> this<00:02:47.470> was<00:02:47.680> all<00:02:47.860> water<00:02:48.100> here

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
water and then this was all water here

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.509 
water and then this was all water here
so<00:02:48.670> i<00:02:48.730> had<00:02:48.819> to<00:02:48.910> put<00:02:49.060> this<00:02:49.209> all<00:02:49.390> in<00:02:50.340> let's<00:02:51.340> see

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
so i had to put this all in let's see

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.699 
so i had to put this all in let's see
what<00:02:51.670> else<00:02:51.700> is<00:02:52.060> there<00:02:52.209> now<00:02:54.989> the<00:02:55.989> one<00:02:56.110> part<00:02:56.319> IV

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
what else is there now the one part IV

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.150 
what else is there now the one part IV
fires<00:02:56.950> that<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:57.340> door<00:02:57.640> isn't<00:02:57.819> big<00:02:58.120> enough<00:02:59.160> so

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
fires that the door isn't big enough so

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.130 
fires that the door isn't big enough so
i'm<00:03:00.310> going<00:03:00.640> to<00:03:00.700> try<00:03:00.850> and<00:03:00.940> find<00:03:01.209> a<00:03:01.390> way<00:03:01.600> i<00:03:01.870> can

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
i'm going to try and find a way i can

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:15.300 
i'm going to try and find a way i can
make<00:03:02.620> that

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.059

in<00:05:20.750> the<00:05:20.840> way<00:05:20.990> of<00:05:21.020> building<00:05:21.349> it<00:05:22.570> let's<00:05:23.570> click

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
in the way of building it let's click

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:24.190 
in the way of building it let's click
the

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
the

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:31.900

oh yeah that's even more and sometimes
they<00:05:32.420> like<00:05:32.990> spiders<00:05:33.590> to<00:05:33.770> die<00:05:34.360> but<00:05:35.590> then<00:05:36.940> most

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:37.940 
they like spiders to die but then most

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.240 
they like spiders to die but then most
it's<00:05:38.810> time<00:05:39.110> they<00:05:39.320> die<00:05:39.680> i<00:05:40.330> believe<00:05:41.330> is<00:05:41.480> again

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
it's time they die i believe is again

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:48.250 
it's time they die i believe is again
stop<00:05:43.840> so<00:05:44.840> better<00:05:45.080> get<00:05:45.230> back<00:05:45.380> inside<00:05:47.050> also<00:05:48.050> when
