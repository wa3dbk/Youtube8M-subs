00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hi Galician friends, how are you? 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.509
 give the girl wins goal and I'm here with 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.059
 this week's suggestions a 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.920
 sorry for the delay they crossed me 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.870
 a little things but the avalanches of 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.660
 here from puerto escondido oaxaca where 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.800
 I'm making a trip but I do not 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.439
 I forget football and I hope that you 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.720
 also and well in this week we have a 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:26.189
 the xolos who have returned from leaders 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.019
 to the tournament opening 2002 I'm very very 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.869
 happy as good as you know 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.700
 This is my team and I could not be more 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.260
 happy but we 're going with the first 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.050
 match of the betting wins a goal that 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.879
 I have some surprises, not so not so 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.190
 good grata is not a matter of winning goal 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.170
 but the party 1 the party of monarchs 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.140
 against atlas will be raffled off because 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.960
 a reprogramming of the party since 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.940
 good is fifa date and for being fifa date 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.320
 of both teams are leading 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.420
 selected both foreigners and 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.090
 Mexicans and good had to change 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.399
 this date and this is how this is drawn 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.500
 lot of luck in this draw in 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.970
 match 2 we have the machine of the 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.480
 Blue Cross 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.280
 in the blue to the roosters of the querétaro 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.730
 good the roosters as we all know the 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.860
 fallen are no longer 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:15.520
 they should only have pulled out 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:18.040
 two points in twelve days what has 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.570
 pretty worried the people of roosters 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.270
 since good they are to a step of the 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.770
 descent but good you are very different 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.110
 the story that you have to use since 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.240
 blue cross has been playing a lot 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.490
 better what the hobby is the state very 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.990
 very happy about that and good makes us 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.570
 a very easy decision therefore we 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.580
 we go for a place in match 3 of the 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.580
 quiniela wins goal we have the champion still 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.530
 the saints that faces my solos 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.260
 because we could not go out with the three 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.550
 points of the corrector and stayed with 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.500
 the tie which shows us that no 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.030
 is making the unstoppable team that 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.610
 we used to see in not having previous 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.130
 tournaments in in the case of me the good ones 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.800
 they are the best visitor with 11 points of 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.960
 the 18 possible things that leaves me very 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.910
 very easy decision 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.620
 iure here you also have to have an eye 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.600
 could leave a draw as good 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.800
 saints of saints can you say a 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.050
 little bit more than he's playing good 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.790
 against the leader of the table which I 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.010
 makes us think that we're going for a double 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.080
 we go for a local and sorry for a 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.270
 tie and a visit 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.100
 in match 4 we have the party of 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.300
 monterrey before the toluca that good will be 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.420
 another game that will have to be drawn 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:25.120
 also because there is a 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.350
 reprogramming by the amount of 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.569
 selected you also wished 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.689
 lots of luck in this tournament 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.849
 in match 5 the Real de San Luis 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:36.409
 they face the good plant in the 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.359
 Real has not been able to win in his last 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:40.370
 three clashes where there was even 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:43.420
 a rout of chiapas that nobody 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.680
 and good is expected 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.810
 we also have 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.689
 the iron ponies of the volpe where 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.299
 they lost the chance to win 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:57.780
 win by losing by when they were two 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.099
 goals against the morelia will have to see if 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.069
 his goal scorer walls will be 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:04.469
 available for this game I think that 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.730
 here are 22 teams that are very even 

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:07.859
 they are more or less in the same place 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.079
 the table so we're going for a 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:13.950
 tie in match 6 we have a 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:16.260
 good match the cougars receive hugo 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.989
 sanchez and al pachuca good I would like 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.060
 see how they are going to receive hugo sanchez 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.939
 the person who made them two-time champions 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.340
 the cougars arrive with their team with the 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:29.400
 pachuca to this stadium 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.920
 I think pachuca is going to be a duel 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.790
 interesting this duel 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.010
 I think it 's very easy here 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.739
 say it since good they are with it as 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.780
 local cougars have a much more daring 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.209
 strong villa that they will want to demonstrate 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.250
 then sanchez stayed even without him go 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.810
 to see what they're made of so it's very 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.560
 easy with everything of locality we go away 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.360
 with the cougars in match 7 we have the 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.340
 party of the people before the america that 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.739
 well another game that is drawn 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.349
 three games drawn this week by 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:03.180
 the same situation was reprogrammed and good 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:05.670
 the players of the national team 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.530
 as of selections 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.299
 foreign players will have their players 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.250
 is fifa date is out of the hands of 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:15.670
 ghana goal and I wish you lots of luck 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.760
 in this tournament in game 8 we have 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.049
 in the chivas that receive the jaguars 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.360
 good the chivas won in the classic 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.639
 national we all saw those two goals of 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.680
 Rafael Marquez, I think it's good for me 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.440
 is going to become a great goal scorer in 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.650
 this tournament 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.220
 those two goals over all the second was 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.620
 wonderful I think they come 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.560
 unstoppable these chivas and good or 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.390
 Jaguars is going to fight, I think so 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.250
 is going to fight but still chivas is coming 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.680
 with all is not going to let us go by 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.260
 a place in game 9 we are going 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.390
 In Brazil-2014 we have the tri that closes 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:51.000
 his participation in the antler in the Aztec 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:53.400
 before the good savior he loves you 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.590
 close in a perfect way the 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:00.000
 eliminatory and thus get to the hexagonal 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:01.710
 final summoned the Europeans and they 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.930
 formed a selection of much much 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.910
 quality will have to be seen if the project is 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.130
 meet the scorer with the tri the same as 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.510
 oribe peralta and here obviously not 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.340
 there's more to say we go with the local 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.890
 we go with the Aztec and we go with 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.470
 mexico in the game days we have the 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:19.550
 heading to Brazil-2014 to the current champion 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:22.140
 World to Spain to get to France 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.590
 good of the two duels we would like 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:26.270
 witness more followed two by three 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.600
 with a spain that has won lately 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:31.370
 everything in europe we have seen but it 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.760
 faces in France that is good full 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:36.680
 of cracks that we know also between 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:40.160
 they are the merengue goalie merengue 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:42.200
 like me karim benzema weird 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.580
 weird to duel because good these two 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.680
 selections are from selections very 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.840
 important me here if I do not risk it 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.610
 we go for a triple place 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.400
 visitor and tie because this is going to 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:54.860
 put terrific in the game 11 we have 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.810
 also heading to brazil-2014 we have the 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:00.230
 selection of chile wants to receive the 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.400
 Argentine selection and fear none of 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.440
 the two has arrived with the best 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.780
 results lately Argentina tied 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.660
 in his visit but and he lost a match 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.550
 friendly against brasil chile lost against 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.800
 Ecuador the friendly against Colombia and the 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:15.290
 Argentine eliminator continues on top 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.150
 of the table which good we do not have left 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:19.700
 more than Argentina because there they have a 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:21.170
 player that certain culés falls very 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.600
 well that good we all know who is 

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:25.970
 god of the month and so we go by the 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.280
 visit in match 12 also heading to 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:30.640
 brazil-2014 we have the national team 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.950
 Venezuelan who will receive the national team 

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:35.180
 Ecuadorian good venezuela achieved a very 

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.670
 good result in his last game 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:40.040
 eliminator by defeating a visit to 

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:42.330
 paraguay which has it with 11 points 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:44.669
 in the fight to the pass to the world 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.810
 Ecuador comes better because it is 

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:47.159
 in the second place of the table by 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:49.020
 Argentina below by a point 

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:50.490
 only for what is going to take you out 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.969
 points with your visit not to go down 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.559
 positions 

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:55.599
 without a hollow the selection of chucho 

00:06:53.559 --> 00:06:57.759
 benítez a player that we want a lot in 

00:06:55.599 --> 00:06:59.889
 mexico so we 're going for a visit 

00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:01.239
 and remember that for five pesos more in 

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:03.189
 the betting winning goal can participate 

00:07:01.239 --> 00:07:05.619
 for the millionaire goal take the bag 

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:06.969
 accumulated last week there were 33 

00:07:05.619 --> 00:07:08.739
 goals I think that these weeks we 

00:07:06.969 --> 00:07:11.529
 let's go a little lower we go with 

00:07:08.739 --> 00:07:14.549
 32 goals if you already made her face equal 

00:07:11.529 --> 00:07:14.549
 fewer matches more
