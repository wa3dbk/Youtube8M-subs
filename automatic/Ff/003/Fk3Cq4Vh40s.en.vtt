sometimes<00:02:36.430> this<00:02:36.610> happens<00:02:36.820> if<00:02:37.150> we<00:02:37.270> let

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
sometimes this happens if we let

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.320 
sometimes this happens if we let
ourselves<00:02:37.570> get<00:02:37.990> too<00:02:38.440> hungry<00:02:38.730> but<00:02:39.730> more<00:02:40.060> times

ourselves get too hungry but more times

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.970 
ourselves get too hungry but more times
than<00:02:40.540> not<00:02:40.600> this<00:02:41.050> happens<00:02:41.470> because<00:02:41.650> we<00:02:41.860> are

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
than not this happens because we are

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.090 
than not this happens because we are
experiencing<00:02:42.760> an<00:02:43.080> overwhelming<00:02:44.100> emotion

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
experiencing an overwhelming emotion

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.979 
experiencing an overwhelming emotion
that<00:02:45.370> we're<00:02:45.520> not<00:02:45.730> comfortable<00:02:46.120> being<00:02:46.690> with

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
that we're not comfortable being with

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.770 
that we're not comfortable being with
and<00:02:47.260> then<00:02:47.739> that<00:02:47.770> is<00:02:48.160> driving<00:02:48.459> the<00:02:49.030> eating<00:02:49.420> so

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
and then that is driving the eating so

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.290 
and then that is driving the eating so
really<00:02:50.489> this<00:02:51.489> takes<00:02:51.820> a<00:02:51.940> little<00:02:52.030> bit<00:02:52.239> of

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
really this takes a little bit of

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.570 
really this takes a little bit of
practice<00:02:52.780> because<00:02:53.080> the<00:02:53.410> idea<00:02:53.800> with<00:02:54.010> this<00:02:54.280> type

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
practice because the idea with this type

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.150 
practice because the idea with this type
of<00:02:54.610> eating<00:02:54.850> is<00:02:55.269> you<00:02:55.420> want<00:02:55.630> to<00:02:55.690> get<00:02:55.920> ahead<00:02:56.920> of

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
of eating is you want to get ahead of

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.000 
of eating is you want to get ahead of
the<00:02:57.790> eating<00:02:58.120> session<00:02:58.510> and<00:02:58.660> really<00:02:59.110> see<00:02:59.380> what

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
the eating session and really see what

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.040 
the eating session and really see what
is<00:03:00.160> coming<00:03:00.340> up<00:03:00.550> for<00:03:00.730> you<00:03:00.790> emotionally<00:03:01.630> that's

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
is coming up for you emotionally that's

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.290 
is coming up for you emotionally that's
driving<00:03:02.800> that<00:03:02.950> eating<00:03:03.430> so<00:03:03.790> that<00:03:03.970> takes<00:03:04.120> a

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
driving that eating so that takes a

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.449 
driving that eating so that takes a
little<00:03:04.420> bit<00:03:04.540> of<00:03:04.690> practice<00:03:05.070> that's<00:03:06.070> actually

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
little bit of practice that's actually

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:07.590 
little bit of practice that's actually
something<00:03:06.670> when<00:03:07.090> I<00:03:07.120> work<00:03:07.300> with<00:03:07.330> my<00:03:07.480> clients

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
something when I work with my clients

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.170 
something when I work with my clients
that<00:03:08.080> I<00:03:08.110> can<00:03:08.320> help<00:03:08.470> them<00:03:08.680> do<00:03:08.890> is<00:03:09.700> do<00:03:10.060> a<00:03:10.090> little

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
that I can help them do is do a little

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.360 
that I can help them do is do a little
detective<00:03:10.660> work<00:03:10.900> around<00:03:11.440> that<00:03:11.620> so<00:03:12.040> you<00:03:12.130> can

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
detective work around that so you can

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.020 
detective work around that so you can
understand<00:03:13.180> what<00:03:14.080> is<00:03:14.320> driving<00:03:14.350> the<00:03:15.310> unwanted

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
understand what is driving the unwanted
