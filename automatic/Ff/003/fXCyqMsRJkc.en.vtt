00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:32.829 
best way I can try and explain is it's

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:35.100 
best way I can try and explain is it's
kind<00:01:33.040> of<00:01:33.130> got<00:01:33.250> a<00:01:33.280> super<00:01:33.759> oh<00:01:33.820> ish<00:01:34.030> Chicago<00:01:34.960> we

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
kind of got a super oh ish Chicago we

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.080 
kind of got a super oh ish Chicago we
feel<00:01:35.470> that's<00:01:36.280> got<00:01:36.460> a<00:01:36.490> lot<00:01:36.640> of<00:01:36.790> dirt<00:01:37.060> and

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
feel that's got a lot of dirt and

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.700 
feel that's got a lot of dirt and
distortion<00:01:37.750> but<00:01:37.930> it<00:01:38.020> doesn't<00:01:38.259> it's<00:01:38.439> not<00:01:38.590> as

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
distortion but it doesn't it's not as

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.469 
distortion but it doesn't it's not as
like<00:01:38.860> doesn't<00:01:39.430> have<00:01:39.460> that<00:01:39.610> British<00:01:39.970> mid-range

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
like doesn't have that British mid-range

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:41.550 
like doesn't have that British mid-range
punch<00:01:40.810> that<00:01:40.960> you<00:01:41.049> get<00:01:41.200> out<00:01:41.320> of<00:01:41.350> like<00:01:41.530> a

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
punch that you get out of like a

punch that you get out of like a
Marshall<00:01:42.070> it's<00:01:42.579> not<00:01:42.729> really<00:01:42.939> like<00:01:43.090> a<00:01:43.119> tweed

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
Marshall it's not really like a tweed

Marshall it's not really like a tweed
amp<00:01:43.689> it's<00:01:43.899> just<00:01:44.079> kind<00:01:44.320> of<00:01:44.409> its<00:01:44.590> own<00:01:44.880> beast<00:01:46.590> when

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
amp it's just kind of its own beast when

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.260 
amp it's just kind of its own beast when
we<00:01:47.740> hear<00:01:47.860> a<00:01:47.890> little<00:01:47.979> bit<00:01:48.159> more<00:01:48.220> um<00:01:48.670> tell<00:01:49.210> us

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
we hear a little bit more um tell us

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.120 
we hear a little bit more um tell us
about<00:01:49.420> the<00:01:49.600> cabinet<00:01:50.350> right<00:01:50.470> before<00:01:50.799> you<00:01:50.950> do
