00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.320
 Hello 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.080
 hello guys well found again 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.300
 on the youtube channel followed by lea and today vi 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.490
 I wanted to talk about the famous meanwhile 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.130
 we have a bit because famas famas 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.990
 could say that we should su tm news su 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.390
 Darmian 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.600
 mammamia is almost scary I was china o 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.720
 anyway, well you have understood not devoid of 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.790
 all no, oh well, I would be beat 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.920
 assault rifle manufacturing weapons of 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.460
 saint etienne translated to french 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.790
 Italian is an assault rifle you have 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.200
 understood is French and by the way is one 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.380
 of the most famous weapons ever 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:58.110
 beautiful video games like the p 90 e 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.430
 the hood 47 are therefore the weapons that most 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.829
 or not are all video games 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.190
 this has more than one famous assault 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.990
 for its high on the net it also goes to 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.450
 via f 4 is denied and really 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.110
 fast facts we pass immediately to 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.440
 statistics 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:17.010
 we are talking about 1200 rpm vico mille is the 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.260
 assault rifle faster than there is on the way 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.470
 f 4, however, the absolute weapon more 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:25.140
 quick to shoot as created kind of 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.890
 all it seems to me that there is a smg of 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:33.570
 genre that cz 3 to 1 which also 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:36.920
 he too at that weapon ii at 1000 rpm e 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:42.570
 so anyway really to a wounds 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:45.810
 between fast then we have unusual damage 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.170
 maximum from close range of 25 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.920
 give a minimum of 50 meters of 18 and a 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.180
 charger alas a quarrel this 26 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.799
 shots 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.390
 then meanwhile they grow in the premises 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.310
 the other time I said it at the end 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.799
 now reason at the beginning the clips don't 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.970
 only mine are from the other Phoenician player 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.299
 boy playing with us 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.190
 so if you see clamorous misses 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.929
 or I just don't like them there 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.329
 you can safely give it on 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.610
 boat type tex underscore fe nilo 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:16.520
 to praise on the boat and then be able to 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.930
 insult him like 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:22.310
 ok said that we start talking about 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.770
 this weapon like a weapon 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:29.340
 fast it is a beautiful thing but 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.690
 even a problem I could summarize the 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.390
 features this weapon by telling you 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.190
 simply that maybe it's the best 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.890
 weapon the strongest weapon of a multiple assault 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.470
 strong 1 with one against one and is the 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.650
 worst against one because play not 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.500
 make this consideration because the fact 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.950
 that it is so fast are only 26 shots 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.380
 it is a terrifying thing that is not only a 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.090
 a recall to south planes with the highest in 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.370
 absolute if you go to add records 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.010
 while in the two axes then to the left and 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.780
 vertical to the right to get the number 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.580
 greater than all the other de 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.920
 Goal of assault rifles 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.470
 moreover, you finish shots this year is 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.660
 an incredible way that I am 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.780
 explaining that even if you are very good 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.960
 to shoot summer of counting shots of 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.660
 basin to kill one fail 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.310
 almost to charger to less than 15 accounts a 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.410
 any of these this up close 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.690
 so it means that you have others 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.410
 another ten to kill another 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.470
 player 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.320
 since I had one always shoot one not 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.450
 at maximum aim control and therefore 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.040
 it must also cultivate some leaves a little 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.280
 more the spread a little more per capita 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.780
 good than making a person out 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.610
 beautiful to make out two becomes almost 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.420
 impossible in this art or that 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:47.520
 although they can be done for charity 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:51.540
 but triple doubles is not that you have to 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:53.310
 be lucky and very good for 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.610
 As for loadout purposes recommend 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.440
 for this weapon the use of the 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.480
 exclusive of the angled group 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.340
 then of course it's okay you can put yourself 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.050
 milini what you want the laser 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.870
 as I said earlier 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.459
 review the lazy 52c cubes put it 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.920
 always because it's always a good thing 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.180
 however with regard to the designer labels and the 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.330
 reeds that are then those that go to 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.459
 change the Greek spread the asset this into 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.299
 this case quater the famous use 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.370
 exclusively the year 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.460
 who has a choice that I personally 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.590
 I agree because these weapons quici 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.020
 form an alliance with a high network that have 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.840
 always a spread already several and a lot 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.879
 high then go there to attack a 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.460
 accessory that further increases it 

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:37.110
 spread is never a good thing 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.240
 the area from the distance with this weapon 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.419
 it's really complicated especially because 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:45.180
 it's hard to try to get it out 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:47.009
 from the pop gun shot that is right 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.280
 complicated than above all for that 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:53.639
 reason even if you pay attention 34 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.900
 shots come out definitely and then 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:57.479
 this is a problem because you know that 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:01.800
 you f4 differences to see in the ass yes 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:03.930
 makes you feel a lot more based on how many 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:05.759
 consecutive shots and then shoot more 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.650
 copious bursts plus long recoil 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:09.870
 accentuated a little the opposite with respect to 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.389
 what was happening via 3 3 then for 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:17.759
 this is the reason for every object 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:20.190
 from afar I said it 

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:22.409
 it will be difficult to do two who maybe but the 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.870
 first loser you meet 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:26.550
 seriously injured because good from 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:30.990
 instant maybe but what do you notice for 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:32.819
 how much is what the weapon to shoot 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.259
 ok also this way is everything there 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:37.190
 leave some final clips and there 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:37.190
 we catch the next one 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.939
 the doctor
