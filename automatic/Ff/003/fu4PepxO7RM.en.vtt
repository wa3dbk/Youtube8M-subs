00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
and so I always thought that I would be

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.180 
and so I always thought that I would be
a<00:02:15.400> high<00:02:15.730> school<00:02:16.090> history<00:02:16.360> teacher<00:02:16.740> and<00:02:17.740> that<00:02:18.069> I

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
a high school history teacher and that I

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.640 
a high school history teacher and that I
would<00:02:18.460> coach<00:02:18.940> football<00:02:19.270> I<00:02:19.780> just<00:02:20.200> thought<00:02:20.590> that

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
would coach football I just thought that

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.850 
would coach football I just thought that
all<00:02:21.010> along<00:02:22.319> until<00:02:23.340> one<00:02:24.340> day<00:02:24.520> in<00:02:24.700> 1963<00:02:25.510> and<00:02:26.050> all

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
all along until one day in 1963 and all

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.080 
all along until one day in 1963 and all
of<00:02:26.980> a<00:02:27.040> sudden<00:02:27.069> changed

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.940 

I<00:02:30.200> just<00:02:31.200> think<00:02:31.440> that<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:32.300> atmosphere<00:02:33.680> in<00:02:34.680> the

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
I just think that the atmosphere in the

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.770 
I just think that the atmosphere in the
town<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.910> kindness<00:02:36.780> that<00:02:37.050> I<00:02:37.170> saw<00:02:38.690> there<00:02:39.690> was

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
town the kindness that I saw there was

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.780 
town the kindness that I saw there was
