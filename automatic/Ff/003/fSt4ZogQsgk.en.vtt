00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.380
 one day 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:10.510
 He has not 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:13.770
 merry christmas another to go shopping 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.770
 not to be done 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:29.180
 milano this joke has gone into 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:31.700
 cement that has and must be levered 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.820
 that business book you have to take it in 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.660
 winter dark green but when I saw 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.430
 well 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.879
 yesterday there was a party they put 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:46.370
 attached to the deal there when I see 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:50.690
 It notes that these things did remain 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:53.089
 committed and for some things some things 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.190
 at the beginning yes now not that much 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:57.680
 however the first two years if also because 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:04.989
 had to end up as special things 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:04.989
 of the church had for example the 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.570
 at the gate 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:15.260
 the mailbox that of course 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.930
 also in the mail we turn and it was not 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:22.040
 planned had not foreseen and the aid 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.690
 to design it also because you get there 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.030
 I would have put one thing in short 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.800
 probably one we talked for 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.890
 positive architecture forgets the 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.229
 most trivial things and that are these and 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.479
 since it is certainly on the facade 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:38.830
 had to have done is the bulletin board with the 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.830
 cassette shows that he designed 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.450
