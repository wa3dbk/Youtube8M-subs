the<00:00:34.649> compass<00:00:34.980> in<00:00:35.100> bad<00:00:35.250> company<00:00:35.460> 2<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:36.059> think<00:00:36.840> I

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
the compass in bad company 2 I think I

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.080 
the compass in bad company 2 I think I
compass<00:00:37.260> helps<00:00:37.559> in<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.829> very<00:00:38.190> variety<00:00:38.760> of

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
compass helps in a very variety of

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.819 
compass helps in a very variety of
levels<00:00:39.329> namely<00:00:39.870> call<00:00:40.140> out<00:00:40.320> so<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:40.530> know<00:00:40.739> if

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
levels namely call out so you know if

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.590 
levels namely call out so you know if
it's<00:00:40.950> north<00:00:41.219> side<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.550> road<00:00:41.790> south<00:00:42.270> side

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.500 
it's north side of the road south side
it<00:00:43.230> just<00:00:43.410> helps<00:00:43.789> now<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.879> next<00:00:45.180> thing<00:00:45.390> I

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
it just helps now the next thing I

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.830 
it just helps now the next thing I

going to be the maximum squad sighs I

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.319 
going to be the maximum squad sighs I
don't<00:00:55.110> know<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.680> could<00:00:55.710> be<00:00:56.160> it's<00:00:56.969> definitely

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
don't know it could be it's definitely

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.880 
don't know it could be it's definitely
going<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.750> be<00:00:57.840> hard<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.199> tell<00:00:58.410> if<00:00:58.530> that's<00:00:58.710> going

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
going to be hard to tell if that's going

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.610 
going to be hard to tell if that's going
to<00:00:59.039> be<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.370> maximum<00:00:59.760> squad<00:01:00.239> sighs<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.960> imagined

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.060 
buttons in the sequence from the single
player<00:05:12.930> might<00:05:13.230> make<00:05:13.380> it<00:05:13.530> into<00:05:13.710> multiplayer

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
player might make it into multiplayer

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.580 
player might make it into multiplayer
where<00:05:14.640> if<00:05:15.600> somebody<00:05:15.810> comes<00:05:16.050> up<00:05:16.140> to<00:05:16.200> stab<00:05:16.560> you

multiplayer<00:05:22.050> that<00:05:22.920> would<00:05:23.040> be<00:05:23.130> kind<00:05:23.340> of<00:05:23.430> cool

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
multiplayer that would be kind of cool

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.270
