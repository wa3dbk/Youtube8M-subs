00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
that 2.5 millimeter jack from this

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.230 
that 2.5 millimeter jack from this
corner<00:01:27.659> here<00:01:27.960> right<00:01:28.920> up<00:01:29.070> there<00:01:29.310> took<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.090> one

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
corner here right up there took that one

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.060 
corner here right up there took that one
off<00:01:30.360> for<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.659> this<00:01:31.350> headset<00:01:31.680> didn't<00:01:31.950> work

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
off for that this headset didn't work

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.819 
off for that this headset didn't work
anymore<00:01:32.310> anyway<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:33.420> we<00:01:33.840> started<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.530> and

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
anymore anyway and we started that and

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
get this to focus soldered that guy in

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.069 
get this to focus soldered that guy in
and<00:01:37.530> hot<00:01:38.400> glued<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.759> down<00:01:38.790> actually<00:01:39.689> hot<00:01:39.869> glued

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
and hot glued it down actually hot glued

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.770 
and hot glued it down actually hot glued
that<00:01:40.170> jack<00:01:40.680> down<00:01:40.890> right<00:01:41.130> here<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.780> then

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
that jack down right here and then

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.859 
that jack down right here and then
soldered<00:01:43.770> on<00:01:43.860> these<00:01:44.009> jumper<00:01:44.340> wires<00:01:44.630> the<00:01:45.630> wire

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
soldered on these jumper wires the wire

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.389 
soldered on these jumper wires the wire
all<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.170> way<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.560> rear<00:01:46.710> sat<00:01:46.950> three<00:01:47.100> pole

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
all the way to the rear sat three pole

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.880 
all the way to the rear sat three pole
2.5<00:01:48.060> inch<00:01:48.619> jack

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
2.5 inch jack

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.030 
2.5 inch jack
so<00:01:50.640> wire<00:01:51.540> all<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.170> way<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.560> rear<00:01:52.740> is<00:01:52.920> the

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
so wire all the way to the rear is the

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.569 
so wire all the way to the rear is the
ground<00:01:53.280> no<00:01:54.149> is<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.420> mic<00:01:54.630> I'm<00:01:54.780> sorry<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.920> next

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
ground no is the mic I'm sorry the next

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.920 
ground no is the mic I'm sorry the next
wire<00:01:56.759> is<00:01:57.030> for<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:58.259> audio<00:01:59.329> and<00:02:00.329> then<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.689> last

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
wire is for the audio and then the last

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.709 
wire is for the audio and then the last
wire<00:02:01.460> or<00:02:02.460> first<00:02:02.850> -<00:02:03.000> everyone<00:02:03.299> look<00:02:03.450> at<00:02:03.600> it

wire or first - everyone look at it

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.370 
wire or first - everyone look at it
right<00:02:04.380> up<00:02:04.469> here<00:02:04.740> goes<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.939> the

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.680
