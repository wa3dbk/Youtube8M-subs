00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.830 

okay<00:03:31.069> so<00:03:31.609> you<00:03:31.730> can<00:03:31.849> see<00:03:32.060> that<00:03:32.090> she's<00:03:32.450> got<00:03:32.659> the

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
okay so you can see that she's got the

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.530 
okay so you can see that she's got the
bull<00:03:33.019> hooks<00:03:33.290> on<00:03:33.469> her<00:03:33.730> that's<00:03:34.730> that<00:03:35.060> took<00:03:35.299> off

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
bull hooks on her that's that took off

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.390 
bull hooks on her that's that took off
getting<00:03:36.019> that<00:03:36.109> short<00:03:36.439> business<00:03:36.620> start<00:03:37.010> I

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
getting that short business start I

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.119 
getting that short business start I
thought<00:03:38.299> that<00:03:38.420> the<00:03:38.840> kids<00:03:39.349> so<00:03:39.560> we<00:03:39.650> both<00:03:39.859> got<00:03:40.099> a

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:40.129 
thought that the kids so we both got a

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:44.259 
thought that the kids so we both got a
rushee<00:03:41.409> on<00:03:42.409> that<00:03:42.620> one<00:03:42.909> so<00:03:43.909> I'm<00:03:43.969> just<00:03:44.060> going<00:03:44.209> to

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
rushee on that one so I'm just going to

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:49.750 
rushee on that one so I'm just going to
set<00:03:44.450> it<00:03:44.480> back<00:03:44.719> up<00:03:44.780> again<00:03:45.109> I<00:03:46.420> thought<00:03:47.420> that<00:03:48.760> will

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
set it back up again I thought that will

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.069 
set it back up again I thought that will
take<00:03:49.969> a<00:03:50.000> path<00:03:50.180> again<00:03:52.389> the<00:03:53.389> best<00:03:53.629> shoulder<00:03:53.810> to

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
take a path again the best shoulder to

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:56.679 
take a path again the best shoulder to
start<00:03:54.139> and<00:03:54.739> then<00:03:55.549> just<00:03:55.849> keep<00:03:56.030> the<00:03:56.239> rib<00:03:56.269> cage

00:03:56.679 --> 00:03:56.689 
start and then just keep the rib cage

00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:02.440 
start and then just keep the rib cage
lined<00:03:57.109> up<00:03:57.379> with<00:03:57.650> you<00:04:00.819> so<00:04:01.819> that<00:04:01.849> it<00:04:02.000> keeps<00:04:02.209> her

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
lined up with you so that it keeps her

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.440 
lined up with you so that it keeps her
coming<00:04:02.870> around<00:04:03.459> it<00:04:04.459> also<00:04:04.730> makes<00:04:05.090> her<00:04:05.239> take

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
coming around it also makes her take

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.629 
coming around it also makes her take
smaller<00:04:05.780> steps<00:04:05.959> she's<00:04:06.769> faster<00:04:07.219> than<00:04:07.340> I<00:04:07.459> am

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:07.639 
smaller steps she's faster than I am

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:12.189 
smaller steps she's faster than I am
whew<00:04:10.030> that's<00:04:11.030> a<00:04:11.120> first<00:04:11.359> as<00:04:11.480> they<00:04:11.569> take<00:04:11.780> smaller

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:12.199 
whew that's a first as they take smaller

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:16.810 
whew that's a first as they take smaller
steps<00:04:12.430> when<00:04:13.430> she<00:04:13.760> wants<00:04:14.180> to<00:04:14.359> rush<00:04:15.519> if<00:04:16.519> you<00:04:16.639> keep

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
steps when she wants to rush if you keep

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.590 
steps when she wants to rush if you keep
that<00:04:16.849> ribcage<00:04:17.239> lined<00:04:17.720> up

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.230 

Oh

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:19.159 

again<00:05:17.729> this<00:05:17.879> isn't<00:05:18.090> something<00:05:18.449> that<00:05:18.599> practice

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
again this isn't something that practice

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:22.760 
again this isn't something that practice
on<00:05:19.319> the<00:05:19.439> regular<00:05:19.800> basis<00:05:20.780> so<00:05:21.780> you're<00:05:22.020> probably

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
on the regular basis so you're probably

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.219 
on the regular basis so you're probably
have<00:05:23.039> to<00:05:23.159> work<00:05:23.310> on<00:05:23.520> it<00:05:23.719> livermore<00:05:24.719> yourself

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:25.229 
have to work on it livermore yourself

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:29.170 
have to work on it livermore yourself
obviously

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.730
