00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
circuit let's have a look how it starts

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.730 
circuit let's have a look how it starts
up<00:01:47.340> I<00:01:47.579> don't<00:01:47.880> think<00:01:48.000> there's<00:01:48.170> so<00:01:49.170> we<00:01:49.259> got<00:01:49.409> Mario

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
up I don't think there's so we got Mario

up I don't think there's so we got Mario
Kart<00:01:49.950> Super<00:01:50.280> circuit<00:01:50.460> II<00:01:51.079> just<00:01:52.079> go<00:01:52.259> there

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
Kart Super circuit II just go there

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.270

single-player<00:01:54.860> this<00:01:55.860> is<00:01:55.950> gonna<00:01:56.070> be

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
single-player this is gonna be

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.929
