 hello everyone with you dan and after 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.910
 updates all smartphones on 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.790
 windows phone 7 5 operating system 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.620
 for windows phone 7 and 8 appeared 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.810
 big delay when opening the app 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:21.980
 and filmed this topic video well and here is the 15th 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:27.109
 March this update version 7.10 came 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:32.570
 80 82. 144 which 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:35.280
 helped solve this problem compare on 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.010
 example of two smartphones and drag and 8x 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:48.239
 on windows phone 8 operating system 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:51.090
 Well, in addition to 800 7 8 so let's start 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.070
 the most basic is a phone call 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:58.760
 previously rebooted and let's 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:03.379
 try so hard to press at the same time 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:10.799
 but you can with absolute certainty 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:15.900
 say that this delay has disappeared what else 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:21.680
 games can be said that even here 78 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.680
 ahead of note 8 to 8 Windows 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:33.630
 here let's example we open the calculator 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.630
 which is important at the same time opened 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:44.819
 you can open your reader 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.819
 depends on dive 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:53.310
 on the number of cores on the phone, let's 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.310
 also open the marketplace 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:07.019
 slightly ahead of 8x 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:12.730
 but no wonder the Internet explorer to 80 too 

00:02:07.019 --> 00:02:14.560
 I won a little bit, for example, you can still 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:21.160
 open settings 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:28.510
 my stop at the same time really 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:31.840
 Corrected a problem and also many write 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.440
 what if the phone began to hold the battery 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.510
 long at the mercy of hundreds of mail holds 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.980
 the battery is still long well and all 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.980
 Thank you for your attention goodbye
