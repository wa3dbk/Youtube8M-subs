00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.399 

let's<00:01:26.369> push<00:01:26.820> my<00:01:27.090> limits<00:01:27.810> in<00:01:27.929> terms<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.289> way

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
let's push my limits in terms of the way

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.520 
let's push my limits in terms of the way
I<00:01:28.619> perceive<00:01:29.250> things<00:01:29.759> in<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.420> past<00:01:30.689> in<00:01:31.049> classes

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
I perceive things in the past in classes

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.950 
I perceive things in the past in classes
we<00:01:31.649> do<00:01:31.770> like<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.219> know<00:01:32.340> group<00:01:32.670> work<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.149> you

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
we do like you know group work and you

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.510 
we do like you know group work and you
hear<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.439> many<00:01:34.649> different<00:01:34.920> viewpoints<00:01:35.429> and

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
hear so many different viewpoints and

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.709 
hear so many different viewpoints and
you<00:01:35.640> go<00:01:35.729> ok<00:01:36.060> that's<00:01:36.090> yeah<00:01:36.420> it's<00:01:36.570> really

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:36.719 
you go ok that's yeah it's really

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:38.480 
you go ok that's yeah it's really
interesting<00:01:37.289> and<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.619> would<00:01:37.770> never<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.219> thought

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
interesting and I would never a thought

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.730 
interesting and I would never a thought
like<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.780> just<00:01:39.960> really<00:01:40.200> pushes<00:01:40.560> you

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
like that and it just really pushes you

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.499 
like that and it just really pushes you
and<00:01:40.950> allows<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.490> become<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:42.149> lot<00:01:42.479> more

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
and allows you become a lot more

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.380 
and allows you become a lot more
open-minded<00:01:43.369> I've<00:01:44.369> seen<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.759> happen<00:01:44.789> so<00:01:45.329> many

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
open-minded I've seen it happen so many

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.440 
open-minded I've seen it happen so many
times<00:01:45.649> hundreds<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.799> times<00:01:47.069> in<00:01:47.340> my<00:01:47.429> 20<00:01:48.299> odd

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
times hundreds of times in my 20 odd

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.779 
times hundreds of times in my 20 odd
years<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.110> never<00:01:49.170> get<00:01:49.590> bored<00:01:49.860> by<00:01:50.340> watching

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
years and I never get bored by watching

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:53.510 
years and I never get bored by watching
that<00:01:51.209> exciting<00:01:51.750> processing<00:01:52.560> young<00:01:53.069> people

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
that exciting processing young people

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.999 
that exciting processing young people
transform<00:01:54.149> themselves<00:01:54.329> into<00:01:55.009> individuals

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
transform themselves into individuals

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.190

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
it it's made me more quipped when I go

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.199 
it it's made me more quipped when I go
out<00:02:03.599> into<00:02:03.989> real<00:02:04.739> life<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.610> actually<00:02:05.759> know

00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:06.209 
out into real life you actually know

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:08.180

what's<00:02:06.569> going<00:02:06.929> on<00:02:07.079> you<00:02:07.289> know<00:02:07.439> how<00:02:07.709> things<00:02:07.920> work

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
what's going on you know how things work

what's going on you know how things work
now<00:02:08.489> you<00:02:08.519> know<00:02:08.910> what's<00:02:09.569> about<00:02:10.079> to<00:02:10.140> come<00:02:10.319> at<00:02:10.649> you

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:10.829 
now you know what's about to come at you

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:12.530 
now you know what's about to come at you
you're<00:02:11.099> not<00:02:11.130> going<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.519> just<00:02:11.700> be<00:02:11.819> put<00:02:12.030> in<00:02:12.360> the

I<00:02:17.560> really<00:02:18.520> had<00:02:18.880> a<00:02:18.910> soft<00:02:19.420> spot<00:02:19.660> for<00:02:19.720> little<00:02:20.170> God

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
I really had a soft spot for little God

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.890 
I really had a soft spot for little God
