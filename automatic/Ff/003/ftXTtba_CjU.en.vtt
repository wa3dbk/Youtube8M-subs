00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 in the video today we are going to learn to 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.339
 connect the virtual module arduino let's 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.440
 to see how connections are made as 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.940
 we get communication between the two and 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.710
 how through an android application 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.019
 we can communicate with the bluetooth 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.429
 of the arduino and to be able to send commands 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.220
 example to light bulbs 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.320
 in this case for pin 12 for 11 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.250
 I can turn them off too or I can vary 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.260
 The intensity 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.180
 You can also get data readings from 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.710
 the analog ports do not think that 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.269
 it is only made to turn on led 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.949
 is therefore in the instruction so that 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.510
 move a servomotor so that it has 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.340
 lift the curtains of the house so that 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.020
 I lit a fireplace for what I 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.940
 want everything can be possible with this 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.559
 type of projects including for 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.420
 turn on the car to start the motorcycle 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.890
 to open a safe to open the 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.719
 house after you have to learn download 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.489
 the arduino application to connect the 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.840
 bluetooth and program the android for 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.770
 let us know, let's see all the 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.770
 steps in this video 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.590
 to start programming the module 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.910
 public initially we come to my page 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.780
 being in the download area in the 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.210
 lower part 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.760
 we found arduino control program by 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.530
 Android bluetooth module we click on 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.300
 hence what we are going to do is mark 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.980
 Irlo entire program to copy in 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.610
 the arduino line we give right click 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.800
 copy 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.510
 we open arduino remember that we already saw 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.040
 how to program the driver and is we have 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.210
 that to be sure before plate we are 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.460
 connected 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.540
 we give you right click paste and here already 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.880
 we have the whole program 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.710
 this program originally made him like this 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.630
 invite and what the teacher says 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.950
 was to make some modifications 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.530
 to find the connection points of the 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.180
 arduino that pin is connected with pepÃ­n 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.920
 of the bluetooth module and we will find 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.869
 in the bottom all that is the 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.150
 program we return to the page of the 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.610
 teacher and we are going to download the plan 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.229
 Arduino connection to bluetooth module 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.000
 we click here and we will find 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.100
 the plan that what we should do to 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.920
 connect it connect the 5 volts of 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.440
 arduino at times in the ground module with 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.840
 earth and pin 0 which is reception 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.610
 let's connect to transmission of 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.750
 bluetooth module the pin or not that is 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.760
 transmission 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.010
 let's reception have crossed the two 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.420
 reception with transmission and transmission 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.830
 reception are all 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.750
 conditions that must be done 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.370
 be careful that this connection is going to 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.830
 do after having downloaded the 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.330
 program to the arduino so in these 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.340
 connections to fire her we have already 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.959
 downloaded the program is now ready what 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.880
 only that we have to give you download 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.530
 we press here and after it is 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.120
 loaded we need the connection of the 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.800
 click module and the connections we see 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.080
 in the diagram we are going to review it by 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.970
 this red wire the power the 5 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.040
 volts of the arduino are connected to the 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.260
 bluetooth at 5 volts also the 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.120
 green is gn of or earth you have connected 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.950
 the same position to the arduino then here 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.320
 pin 0 left with a cable color 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.180
 orange to the arduino is connected to 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.670
 transmission remembers that crossed 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.410
 bluetooth transmission with reception 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.610
 of the arduino equal the yellow wire 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.380
 yellow wire on the tree and it's not 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.239
 transmission that is on pin 1 and it's going 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.590
 connected to bluetooth reception 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.000
 on the back of the module 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.530
 bluetooth we can see the points of 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.050
 connection with the names that is 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.910
 Transmission reception in the voltage 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.260
 current contains it is mandatory that 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.209
 when we go to download the program 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.920
 on the side and not the bluetooh module 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.840
 be disconnected because if we do not 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.610
 generates errors at the time of taking 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.780
 It carlo this is because the module is 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.810
 connected to the transmission and reception 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.220
 so we must remove them and being 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.379
 disconnected the cables if we can 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.610
 download the program to the arduino after 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:14.739
 that we have done it we go back to 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.239
 connect them the module will have a led 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.129
 red indicating that it is on but 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.989
 is going to be blinking this means 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:21.549
 that there is still no communication with another 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.080
 bluetooh device in this case the del 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.640
 android later that we have already 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.170
 proven that the bluetooth module works 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.000
 is connected we can make the connection 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.250
 of the pins that we're going to try the 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.049
 program has a series of definitions 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.880
 and it comes divided into parts the most 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.920
 important is at the end we have a 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.650
 switch function in case it has been lost 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.780
 button 13 then sends me a pulse to 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.540
 through pin 13 of the arduino the same 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.280
 he does it with 12 11 10 with everyone if there's 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.959
 to modify something for example on the pin 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.720
 9 and generate a function of a servomotor 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:52.180
 or something what I do is stick to chemical dt 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.680
 and to erase these two lines that the 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.480
 At the moment, all they do is turn on or 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.549
 turn off a led if I want to make another 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.220
 modification to connect a relay to 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:01.629
 turn on a 220 bulb to open 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.610
 a door for whatever 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:04.629
 I can go modifying the program without 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.459
 no problem 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:08.500
 above we find the options for 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.630
 place text 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.460
 10 data or characters through the 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.620
 application we have the variants for 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.329
 get text and in this same way is 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.709
 documented the entire program so that 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.570
 you can vary it in your taste 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.640
 remember that this is part of the 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.990
 collective intelligence is to say all 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.160
 the software are open to be 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.140
 modified by the one they want 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.190
 depending on the application the program 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.260
 it's not so complex it's fine 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.360
 documented so depending on what 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.920
 who want can be modified here 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.200
 is for example the option that allows 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.330
 read then the analog body 0 now 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.860
 we return to the download area of ââthe 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.330
 own channel I want 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.160
 thank the people that in these 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.630
 10 have invited me a coffee and that has 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.550
 served to buy new components 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.990
 since it is a donation to this channel and 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.030
 I could acquire other components like 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.770
 the accelerometer to be able to make futures 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.600
 videos that send the inclination of a 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.430
 remote control like the console does 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.500
 of the wii remember that it is a coffee of only 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.820
 a dollar and for nothing are the 20 dollars 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.500
 what can a class of 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.669
 electronics in any country so 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.530
 thank you very much to all those who are 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:04.510
 sponsoring with this channel by inviting 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:08.020
 a delicious Colombian coffee we come to 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:09.790
 the droid arduino app in apk format here 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.530
 You can download it and install it 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.840
 cell phone I know that everyone does not 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.190
 you know how to install an apk application what 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.600
 let's learn how to take a picture 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.280
 videos since we're going to create our 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.930
 own application so I'm going to 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.880
 show the other method that is download 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.770
 of the gift of the android play store 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.690
 Another way to download it is to download it from 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.430
 play stop so we enter the store 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.440
 being in the store we are going to look for 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.330
 and we write on the top 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.400
 ardÃºh droid I have it because I already 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.740
 had looked for is the application that 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.570
 appears as arturo made by hashim and 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.100
 what we do is install it I already have 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.630
 installed I will not do it again and 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.580
 this is the icon that we have installed 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.020
 arturo and first thing if we already have 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.790
 our application let's see how 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.650
 connect the bluetooth module as 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.600
 we made the connection the first thing that 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.490
 we must ensure is to have on 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.260
 another bluetooth module in our 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.090
 phone if it becomes disabled 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.530
 we must turn it on after it is 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.900
 on we go to the application 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.400
 arturo and being between the application we 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.560
 we come to the menu and there we find 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.610
 connect to bluetooth device 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.350
 then we see a series of 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:09.160
 devices that we have because the beech 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:11.620
 detected and we go to hc 06 we give it 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.330
 connect wait a moment if he does not 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.490
 has stopped blinking it was that it failed in 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.530
 the attempt but when the 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:19.180
 led was that it was connected if necessary 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:21.070
 must repeat the operation a couple of 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.910
 times until you connect as you are 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.980
 fixed means that 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:25.510
 connected we can connect some led 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.430
 test or initially we can do it 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:28.180
 with the 13 we already know that it has a led 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:29.770
 internal 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.510
 so that no press to turn 13 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:33.520
 the internal led will light up and we would see 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:35.380
 how it turns on it turns on and off and 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.940
 then we can connect some led 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.470
 test or the application that we have 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.090
 developed with this program we can 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:41.290
 connect all digital ports 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:43.180
 but in this case we're just 

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:44.590
 connecting from 9 to 13 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.450
 what we do is to get to the 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:47.830
 positive of the leds then leave with a 

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:49.630
 resistance in this case one kilo 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:51.010
 obvious that it goes to this green wire that we 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:52.450
 ends up leading to a ground point 

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:54.160
 these are all the connections of the 

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:56.020
 leds remember that if you update 

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.760
 the program that I left them can instead 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.890
 of turning on a led send the order to 

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.150
 control a servomotor we already saw it in 

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:02.920
 other videos how to control the 

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:04.420
 servomotors how to monitor with a 

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.100
 distance sensor we also saw the 

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.450
 videos and as I told them the limit the 

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.410
 imagination of all the projects that 

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:10.450
 can be done with this application 

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:12.580
 I hope you have learned with this program 

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:14.080
 how to connect the bluetooth module and 

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:16.360
 be useful in your projects 

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.340
 remember to give me a like to the video and 

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.110
 we will be creating now our 

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:22.000
 own application not using this one 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:23.680
 but creating an own application in 

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.120
 much simpler android but we're going 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.130
 to learn how to subscribe to my channel 

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.270
 enter my triple page or link the 

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.680
 teacher point 

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.120
 and thank you very much to all the people 

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.800
 these days they have invited me 

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.300
 coffee of my page thanks to them I can 

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.860
 buy materials and continue with this 

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:38.580
 educational project see you next 

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.580
 Wednesday
