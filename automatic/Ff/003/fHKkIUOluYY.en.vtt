00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.910 

okay<00:00:17.820> so<00:00:18.810> now<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.050> verse<00:00:19.350> okay

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
okay so now the verse okay

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.290 
okay so now the verse okay
so<00:00:19.980> you<00:00:20.070> got<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.340> verse<00:00:20.520> now<00:00:20.760> coming<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.180> the

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
so you got the verse now coming to the

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:33.910 
so you got the verse now coming to the
end<00:00:21.450> of<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.630> verse<00:00:24.619> so<00:00:25.619> now<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.800> last<00:00:26.070> part<00:00:26.400> is

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.099 

then<00:00:34.550> if<00:00:34.670> they<00:00:34.789> have<00:00:34.940> a<00:00:34.969> C<00:00:35.300> minor<00:00:35.539> here<00:00:35.899> right

00:00:36.099 --> 00:00:36.109 
then if they have a C minor here right

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:37.919 
then if they have a C minor here right
with<00:00:36.289> the<00:00:36.350> e-flat

00:00:37.919 --> 00:00:37.929 
with the e-flat

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:40.599 
with the e-flat
that's<00:00:38.929> the<00:00:39.079> chord<00:00:39.320> change<00:00:39.589> but<00:00:39.800> it's<00:00:39.980> an<00:00:40.460> E

00:00:40.599 --> 00:00:40.609 
that's the chord change but it's an E

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:45.399 
that's the chord change but it's an E
flat<00:00:40.850> six<00:00:41.379> but<00:00:43.449> it's<00:00:44.449> too<00:00:44.719> soon<00:00:44.960> to<00:00:45.140> hit<00:00:45.260> the

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:45.409 
flat six but it's too soon to hit the

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:48.099 
flat six but it's too soon to hit the
root<00:00:45.589> in<00:00:46.399> my<00:00:46.609> opinion<00:00:47.059> this<00:00:47.479> should<00:00:47.539> be<00:00:47.929> a

00:00:48.099 --> 00:00:48.109 
root in my opinion this should be a

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:52.359 
root in my opinion this should be a
transition<00:00:50.320> to<00:00:51.320> the<00:00:51.440> first<00:00:51.649> measure<00:00:51.949> of<00:00:52.100> the

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:52.369 
transition to the first measure of the

00:00:52.369 --> 00:01:01.650 
transition to the first measure of the
refrain<00:00:52.729> so<00:00:53.149> it<00:00:53.269> should<00:00:53.479> be

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.560 

and<00:01:02.260> get<00:01:02.380> that<00:01:02.590> so<00:01:03.460> what<00:01:03.640> I<00:01:03.670> did<00:01:03.790> was<00:01:04.090> a<00:01:04.120> three

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
and get that so what I did was a three

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.040 
and get that so what I did was a three
then<00:01:04.989> I<00:01:05.020> came<00:01:05.140> down<00:01:05.320> chromatically<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.900> know

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
then I came down chromatically you know

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.890 
then I came down chromatically you know
flat<00:01:08.440> 3<00:01:08.770> 2<00:01:09.930> then<00:01:10.930> I<00:01:11.080> can<00:01:11.290> go<00:01:11.410> to<00:01:11.530> 5<00:01:12.870> right<00:01:13.870> there

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
flat 3 2 then I can go to 5 right there

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.170 
flat 3 2 then I can go to 5 right there
so<00:01:14.440> right<00:01:14.680> on<00:01:14.710> that<00:01:15.100> where<00:01:15.460> it<00:01:15.550> was<00:01:15.670> out<00:01:15.940> the

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
so right on that where it was out the

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.210 
so right on that where it was out the
one<00:01:16.360> I<00:01:16.390> go<00:01:16.720> to<00:01:16.750> 3<00:01:17.110> instead<00:01:17.530> in<00:01:17.740> it<00:01:17.860> and<00:01:18.070> it

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
one I go to 3 instead in it and it

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.000 
one I go to 3 instead in it and it
creates<00:01:18.520> a<00:01:18.730> little<00:01:19.140> movement<00:01:20.140> nice<00:01:20.590> little

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
creates a little movement nice little

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.130 
creates a little movement nice little
movement<00:01:21.520> chromatic<00:01:22.180> movement<00:01:22.540> into<00:01:22.810> the<00:01:22.840> one

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
movement chromatic movement into the one

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:34.940 
movement chromatic movement into the one
chord

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.860 

not<00:01:35.950> right<00:01:36.160> here<00:01:36.460> you<00:01:36.610> need<00:01:36.820> something<00:01:37.660> in

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:37.870 
not right here you need something in

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.040 
not right here you need something in
that<00:01:38.580> space<00:01:39.580> where<00:01:40.030> there's<00:01:40.210> no<00:01:40.270> cord<00:01:40.720> so<00:01:41.020> I

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
that space where there's no cord so I

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.870 
that space where there's no cord so I
putting<00:01:41.560> a<00:01:41.650> progression<00:01:42.040> I'm<00:01:42.520> going<00:01:42.700> to<00:01:42.760> go

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
putting a progression I'm going to go

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:49.080 
putting a progression I'm going to go
for<00:01:43.950> dominate<00:01:44.950> four<00:01:45.480> three<00:01:47.430> six<00:01:48.430> dominant

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
for dominate four three six dominant

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.160 
for dominate four three six dominant
like<00:01:49.240> that<00:01:49.480> so<00:01:49.840> it's<00:01:50.020> a<00:01:50.110> 1<00:01:50.320> it's<00:01:50.560> a<00:01:50.650> 1<00:01:50.890> 4<00:01:51.790> 3<00:01:52.450> 6

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
like that so it's a 1 it's a 1 4 3 6

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:00.140 
like that so it's a 1 it's a 1 4 3 6
that's<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:53.710> progression<00:01:54.250> so<00:01:54.430> again

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.590 

you

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.550 

see<00:02:04.200> that<00:02:04.380> how<00:02:04.980> that<00:02:05.159> works

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.839 

now<00:02:09.130> you<00:02:09.190> need<00:02:09.429> something<00:02:09.850> here

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
now you need something here

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.820 
now you need something here
now<00:02:12.420> I'd<00:02:12.599> like<00:02:12.810> this

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.980 

for<00:02:16.370> that<00:02:16.630> ascending<00:02:17.630> line<00:02:17.840> to<00:02:18.590> harmonize<00:02:19.040> it

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
for that ascending line to harmonize it

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.040 
for that ascending line to harmonize it
now<00:02:20.990> here<00:02:21.260> you<00:02:21.380> have

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
now here you have

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.160 
now here you have
sort<00:02:24.050> of<00:02:24.080> a<00:02:24.170> diminished<00:02:24.620> chord<00:02:24.830> right<00:02:26.020> to<00:02:27.020> the

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
sort of a diminished chord right to the

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.740 
sort of a diminished chord right to the
a-flat<00:02:27.970> so<00:02:28.970> if<00:02:29.030> he<00:02:29.150> thought<00:02:29.390> it<00:02:29.510> could<00:02:29.540> be

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
a-flat so if he thought it could be

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.650 
a-flat so if he thought it could be
thought<00:02:29.930> of<00:02:29.990> as<00:02:30.140> an<00:02:30.260> a-flat<00:02:30.530> diminished

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.730 

here's<00:02:35.660> another<00:02:35.750> diminished<00:02:36.380> chord<00:02:36.590> an

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
here's another diminished chord an

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:48.630 
here's another diminished chord an
f-sharp<00:02:40.990> or<00:02:41.990> could<00:02:42.200> be<00:02:42.910> you'll<00:02:43.910> see

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.970 

my<00:02:49.640> data<00:02:49.910> cargo<00:02:50.270> F<00:02:50.480> sharp<00:02:50.810> to<00:02:51.020> G<00:02:51.050> minor<00:02:51.470> then

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
my data cargo F sharp to G minor then

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.020 
my data cargo F sharp to G minor then
the<00:02:52.220> C<00:02:52.460> minor<00:02:53.560> now<00:02:54.560> this<00:02:54.770> is<00:02:54.950> obviously<00:02:55.130> here

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
the C minor now this is obviously here

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.520 
the C minor now this is obviously here
an<00:02:56.330> f7<00:02:57.050> or<00:02:57.200> an<00:02:57.560> f9<00:02:58.480> it<00:02:59.480> can<00:02:59.660> have<00:02:59.840> the<00:02:59.990> flat<00:03:00.230> 5

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
an f7 or an f9 it can have the flat 5

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.870 
an f7 or an f9 it can have the flat 5
and<00:03:00.770> if<00:03:00.920> you<00:03:01.010> want

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
and if you want

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.020 
and if you want
now<00:03:03.880> immediately<00:03:04.180> becomes<00:03:04.780> miners<00:03:06.030> because

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
now immediately becomes miners because

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.300 
now immediately becomes miners because
of<00:03:07.150> the<00:03:07.239> bat<00:03:07.510> or<00:03:07.780> a<00:03:07.810> sharp<00:03:08.200> line

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.340 

here<00:03:11.880> I<00:03:11.910> like<00:03:12.120> to<00:03:12.240> use<00:03:12.390> the<00:03:12.510> tritone<00:03:12.900> sub<00:03:13.200> sit

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
here I like to use the tritone sub sit

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.630 
here I like to use the tritone sub sit
there<00:03:13.500> just<00:03:13.530> because<00:03:13.830> the<00:03:13.980> sound<00:03:14.340> of<00:03:14.520> that

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
there just because the sound of that

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.880 
there just because the sound of that
what<00:03:15.060> you<00:03:15.180> want<00:03:15.360> is<00:03:15.420> a<00:03:15.480> tritone<00:03:16.020> right<00:03:16.440> here<00:03:16.740> on

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
what you want is a tritone right here on

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.560 
what you want is a tritone right here on
the<00:03:17.070> F<00:03:17.220> minor<00:03:17.490> on<00:03:18.270> the<00:03:18.390> two<00:03:18.570> chord<00:03:20.570> which

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
the F minor on the two chord which

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.610 
the F minor on the two chord which
should<00:03:21.810> be<00:03:21.900> a<00:03:21.930> fine<00:03:22.260> I<00:03:22.620> use<00:03:23.250> them<00:03:24.350> now<00:03:25.350> step

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
should be a fine I use them now step

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.550 

you

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.760 

now<00:03:55.980> here<00:03:56.430> I<00:03:59.390> put<00:04:00.390> the<00:04:00.510> C<00:04:00.750> minor<00:04:00.990> on<00:04:01.230> that<00:04:01.470> note

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
now here I put the C minor on that note

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.970 
now here I put the C minor on that note
there<00:04:02.069> and<00:04:02.340> then<00:04:02.880> I<00:04:02.910> immediately<00:04:03.180> go<00:04:03.630> to<00:04:03.660> a<00:04:03.980> c7

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
there and then I immediately go to a c7

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:11.300 
there and then I immediately go to a c7
sharp<00:04:05.430> 9<00:04:06.890> there's<00:04:07.890> a<00:04:07.950> c7<00:04:09.650> sharp<00:04:10.650> 5<00:04:10.950> that's

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
sharp 9 there's a c7 sharp 5 that's

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:18.150 
sharp 9 there's a c7 sharp 5 that's
called<00:04:11.610> for<00:04:11.910> their<00:04:12.180> in<00:04:12.300> the<00:04:12.390> melody

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.140 

you<00:04:18.640> following<00:04:18.970> me

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.100 

so<00:04:22.780> they're<00:04:22.990> going<00:04:23.199> f-sharp<00:04:23.410> G<00:04:24.070> minor<00:04:24.340> C<00:04:24.820> minor

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
so they're going f-sharp G minor C minor

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:31.710 
so they're going f-sharp G minor C minor
11<00:04:27.389> just<00:04:28.470> dominant<00:04:30.060> that's<00:04:31.060> a<00:04:31.210> tricky<00:04:31.570> little

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
11 just dominant that's a tricky little

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.719 
11 just dominant that's a tricky little
thing<00:04:31.870> there<00:04:32.320> from<00:04:32.919> the<00:04:33.040> C<00:04:33.280> minor<00:04:33.490> which<00:04:33.699> is

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
thing there from the C minor which is

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:36.170 
thing there from the C minor which is
really<00:04:34.060> the<00:04:34.210> sixth<00:04:34.570> chord<00:04:34.870> now<00:04:35.139> becomes<00:04:35.620> dumb

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
really the sixth chord now becomes dumb

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.990 
really the sixth chord now becomes dumb
at<00:04:37.180> the<00:04:37.419> end<00:04:37.570> there<00:04:38.190> this<00:04:39.190> could<00:04:39.400> be<00:04:39.520> dominant

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
at the end there this could be dominant

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.749 
at the end there this could be dominant
or<00:04:40.120> minor<00:04:40.389> 7

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:42.759 
or minor 7

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:44.969 
or minor 7
see<00:04:43.659> but<00:04:43.809> the<00:04:43.930> poor<00:04:44.169> things<00:04:44.379> you<00:04:44.469> get<00:04:44.559> the<00:04:44.620> flow

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:44.979 
see but the poor things you get the flow

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:52.989 
see but the poor things you get the flow
of<00:04:45.009> those<00:04:45.249> cords<00:04:45.789> with<00:04:46.419> that<00:04:46.629> baseline<00:04:47.199> flow

00:04:52.989 --> 00:04:52.999 

00:04:52.999 --> 00:05:02.560 

however<00:04:53.749> it<00:04:53.869> is<00:04:54.159> there's<00:04:55.159> that<00:04:55.369> progression

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.260 

see<00:05:03.110> I'm<00:05:03.230> keeping<00:05:03.410> this<00:05:03.740> this<00:05:04.340> flow<00:05:04.790> going<00:05:05.150> in

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
see I'm keeping this this flow going in

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.690 
see I'm keeping this this flow going in
the<00:05:05.360> left<00:05:05.570> hand

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:38.169 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:41.559 

little<00:05:39.169> rhythm<00:05:39.439> in<00:05:39.559> there

00:05:41.559 --> 00:05:41.569 
little rhythm in there
