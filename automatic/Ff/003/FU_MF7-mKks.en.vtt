little bit you get blisters if you use
them<00:03:03.180> for<00:03:03.360> something<00:03:03.390> like<00:03:03.750> mountain<00:03:04.080> biking

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
them for something like mountain biking

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.850 
them for something like mountain biking
because<00:03:06.390> there's<00:03:06.840> no<00:03:06.989> real<00:03:07.170> extra<00:03:07.440> protection

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
because there's no real extra protection

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.080

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
use permanently as my one glove I would

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.750 
use permanently as my one glove I would
pick<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.360> camelbaks<00:03:18.840> they<00:03:19.500> offer<00:03:19.799> more<00:03:20.250> with

pick the camelbaks they offer more with
the<00:03:20.940> fire<00:03:21.150> resistance<00:03:21.750> and<00:03:22.019> the<00:03:22.950> little<00:03:23.100> bit

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
the fire resistance and the little bit

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.490 
the fire resistance and the little bit
of<00:03:23.400> extra<00:03:23.640> protection<00:03:24.330> and<00:03:24.630> I<00:03:25.170> don't<00:03:25.350> really

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
of extra protection and I don't really

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.520 
of extra protection and I don't really
think<00:03:25.620> that<00:03:25.980> this<00:03:26.160> palm<00:03:27.170> compromises<00:03:28.170> any<00:03:28.350> of

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
think that this palm compromises any of

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:29.810 
think that this palm compromises any of
the<00:03:28.650> dexterity<00:03:29.040> because<00:03:29.459> I<00:03:29.489> don't<00:03:29.700> really

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
the dexterity because I don't really

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.940 
the dexterity because I don't really
need<00:03:30.030> dexterity<00:03:30.570> in<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.780> palm<00:03:31.049> more<00:03:31.830> the

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
need dexterity in the palm more the

fingers that that need dexterity and

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.759 
fingers that that need dexterity and
these<00:03:36.390> do<00:03:36.600> offer<00:03:36.780> a<00:03:36.959> bit<00:03:37.230> of<00:03:37.350> cold<00:03:37.590> weather

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
these do offer a bit of cold weather

a<00:04:32.640> Velcro<00:04:33.320> strip<00:04:34.320> here<00:04:34.740> the<00:04:35.310> cuff<00:04:35.610> is<00:04:35.910> just

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
a Velcro strip here the cuff is just

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.330 
a Velcro strip here the cuff is just
elastic<00:04:36.780> and<00:04:36.930> you<00:04:36.990> can<00:04:37.110> just<00:04:37.260> pull<00:04:37.410> it<00:04:37.560> right

elastic and you can just pull it right
on<00:04:38.610> and<00:04:38.880> it's<00:04:39.630> it's<00:04:39.930> the<00:04:40.200> cuffs<00:04:40.440> it's<00:04:40.710> a<00:04:40.800> bit

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
on and it's it's the cuffs it's a bit

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.090 
on and it's it's the cuffs it's a bit
lower<00:04:41.430> than<00:04:42.210> the<00:04:42.390> oakley<00:04:42.780> cuff<00:04:43.020> does<00:04:43.320> the

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
lower than the oakley cuff does the

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.370 
lower than the oakley cuff does the
oakley<00:04:44.430> cuff<00:04:44.640> goes<00:04:45.540> up<00:04:45.720> a<00:04:45.840> little<00:04:46.050> bit<00:04:46.170> higher

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
oakley cuff goes up a little bit higher

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.830 
oakley cuff goes up a little bit higher
and<00:04:46.680> I<00:04:47.370> do<00:04:47.550> think<00:04:47.910> that<00:04:48.030> the<00:04:48.210> cuff<00:04:48.450> on<00:04:48.630> the<00:04:48.720> oak

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
and I do think that the cuff on the oak

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.770 
and I do think that the cuff on the oak
leaves<00:04:49.110> is<00:04:49.400> very<00:04:50.400> nice<00:04:50.670> and<00:04:51.090> probably<00:04:51.690> a

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
leaves is very nice and probably a

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.180 
leaves is very nice and probably a
little<00:04:52.050> bit<00:04:52.260> better<00:04:52.440> than<00:04:52.590> the<00:04:52.650> camelbaks

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
little bit better than the camelbaks

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.850 
little bit better than the camelbaks
just<00:04:53.430> because<00:04:53.870> it'll<00:04:54.870> stay<00:04:55.260> a<00:04:55.290> little<00:04:55.470> snugger

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
just because it'll stay a little snugger

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.410 
just because it'll stay a little snugger
and<00:04:56.190> it's<00:04:56.310> a<00:04:56.370> little<00:04:56.580> bit<00:04:56.700> higher<00:04:56.910> up<00:04:57.150> other

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
and it's a little bit higher up other

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.240 
and it's a little bit higher up other
than<00:04:57.780> that<00:04:57.870> I'd<00:04:58.170> say<00:04:58.350> the<00:04:58.470> camelbaks<00:04:58.920> are

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
than that I'd say the camelbaks are

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.970 
than that I'd say the camelbaks are
superior<00:04:59.790> now<00:05:00.510> these<00:05:00.720> run<00:05:01.530> a<00:05:01.560> little<00:05:01.800> more
