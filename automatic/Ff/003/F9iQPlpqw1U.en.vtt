00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
living things I think it's a 55 gallon

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.590 
living things I think it's a 55 gallon
my<00:00:19.320> wife<00:00:19.800> says<00:00:20.279> it's<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.520> 50<00:00:20.760> gallon<00:00:20.880> she's

my wife says it's a 50 gallon she's
probably<00:00:21.990> right<00:00:22.260> because<00:00:22.500> she's<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:22.949> one

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
probably right because she's the one

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.109 
probably right because she's the one
that<00:00:23.130> bought<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.460> that's<00:00:23.519> been<00:00:23.699> using<00:00:23.880> it

recently<00:00:33.030> we<00:00:33.270> did<00:00:33.450> some<00:00:33.750> killifish<00:00:34.440> in<00:00:34.739> it<00:00:34.860> but

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
recently we did some killifish in it but

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.240 
recently we did some killifish in it but
we<00:00:36.329> got<00:00:36.480> tired<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.840> doing<00:00:36.930> freshwater<00:00:37.920> tanks

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
we got tired of doing freshwater tanks

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.130 
we got tired of doing freshwater tanks
after<00:00:38.430> about<00:00:38.670> 17<00:00:39.210> years<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.510> doing<00:00:39.690> them<00:00:39.809> so

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
after about 17 years of doing them so

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.520 
after about 17 years of doing them so
we've<00:00:40.410> decided<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.890> do<00:00:41.040> our<00:00:41.070> first<00:00:41.520> saltwater

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
we've decided to do our first saltwater

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.740 
we've decided to do our first saltwater
so<00:00:43.530> either<00:00:44.219> this<00:00:44.520> is<00:00:44.579> gonna<00:00:44.820> turn<00:00:45.059> out<00:00:45.120> awesome

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
so either this is gonna turn out awesome

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.630 
so either this is gonna turn out awesome
or<00:00:46.379> it's<00:00:46.620> gonna<00:00:46.739> be<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.920> huge<00:00:47.190> waste<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.520> money

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
or it's gonna be a huge waste of money

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.160 
or it's gonna be a huge waste of money
and<00:00:47.879> I'm<00:00:48.870> going<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.320> hate<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.520> entire<00:00:50.640> thing

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
things to go ahead and get it started

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.770 
things to go ahead and get it started
we're<00:00:56.100> gonna<00:00:56.190> start<00:00:56.430> out<00:00:56.520> with<00:00:56.550> these<00:00:57.480> items

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
we're gonna start out with these items

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.130 
we're gonna start out with these items
right<00:00:57.870> here<00:00:58.609> we've<00:00:59.609> got<00:00:59.879> some<00:01:00.120> basic<00:01:00.870> very

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
right here we've got some basic very

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.500 
right here we've got some basic very
fine<00:01:01.350> sand<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.829> go<00:01:01.949> in<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.219> we've<00:01:02.969> got<00:01:03.210> some

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
fine sand to go in it we've got some

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.660 
fine sand to go in it we've got some
live<00:01:03.840> sand<00:01:04.229> which<00:01:04.589> may<00:01:04.860> or<00:01:04.979> may<00:01:05.070> not<00:01:05.100> be<00:01:05.430> alive

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
live sand which may or may not be alive

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.359 
live sand which may or may not be alive
may<00:01:06.360> may<00:01:06.600> not<00:01:06.750> have<00:01:06.930> anything<00:01:07.110> in<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.920> then

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
may may not have anything in it and then

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.090 
may may not have anything in it and then
we've<00:01:08.490> got<00:01:08.640> some<00:01:08.909> crushed<00:01:09.630> coral<00:01:09.900> type<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.860> add

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
we've got some crushed coral type to add

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.490 
we've got some crushed coral type to add
a<00:01:11.130> little<00:01:11.369> different<00:01:12.119> texture<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.290> sand

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
a little different texture to the sand

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.359 
a little different texture to the sand
hopefully<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.460> regulate<00:01:15.119> our<00:01:15.270> pH<00:01:15.540> values<00:01:15.930> and

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
hopefully to regulate our pH values and

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.010 
hopefully to regulate our pH values and
everything<00:01:17.369> else<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:17.909> goes<00:01:17.970> into<00:01:18.119> making<00:01:18.810> a

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
everything else that goes into making a

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.969 
everything else that goes into making a
tank<00:01:19.490> now<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.520> am<00:01:20.850> by<00:01:21.030> no<00:01:21.299> means<00:01:21.330> an<00:01:21.990> expert<00:01:22.320> in

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
tank now I am by no means an expert in

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.160 
tank now I am by no means an expert in
saltwater<00:01:23.340> in<00:01:24.060> fact<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.540> haven't<00:01:24.750> ever<00:01:24.840> done<00:01:25.080> it

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
saltwater in fact I haven't ever done it

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.630 
saltwater in fact I haven't ever done it
before<00:01:25.200> or<00:01:25.650> ever<00:01:25.799> taken<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.130> class<00:01:26.310> on<00:01:26.460> how<00:01:26.520> to

do it but this is gonna be a learning

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.050 
do it but this is gonna be a learning
process<00:01:31.650> we're<00:01:32.220> gonna<00:01:32.310> figure<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.670> out<00:01:32.820> and

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
process we're gonna figure it out and

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.819 
process we're gonna figure it out and
we're<00:01:33.240> gonna<00:01:33.299> get<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.630> started<00:01:33.799> here<00:01:34.799> we<00:01:34.890> go

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829 
we're gonna get it started here we go

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:39.260 
we're gonna get it started here we go
this<00:01:37.829> is<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:38.070> one<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.880> things<00:01:38.909> that<00:01:39.180> I'm

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
this is a one of the things that I'm

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.310 
this is a one of the things that I'm
putting<00:01:39.329> in<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.570> bottom<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.810> my<00:01:39.840> tank<00:01:40.140> it's

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
putting in the bottom of my tank it's

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.410 
putting in the bottom of my tank it's
the<00:01:40.470> Caribbean<00:01:41.189> puka<00:01:41.549> shells<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:42.000> actually<00:01:42.270> is

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
the Caribbean puka shells it actually is

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.819 
the Caribbean puka shells it actually is
much<00:01:42.750> cooler<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.259> thought<00:01:43.470> it<00:01:43.619> was<00:01:43.710> gonna

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
much cooler and I thought it was gonna

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.920 
much cooler and I thought it was gonna
be<00:01:44.119> dumped<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.180> out<00:01:45.240> here<00:01:45.450> in<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.600> bottom<00:01:45.840> of

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
be dumped it out here in the bottom of

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.469 
be dumped it out here in the bottom of
the<00:01:46.020> video<00:01:46.290> tank<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.070> that's<00:01:47.670> got<00:01:47.909> all<00:01:48.149> sorts

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
the video tank and that's got all sorts

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.539 
the video tank and that's got all sorts
of<00:01:48.509> cool<00:01:48.659> little<00:01:49.140> shells<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.680> shell

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549

while I've changed the filter pad a few

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.869 
while I've changed the filter pad a few
times<00:02:17.680> trying<00:02:18.010> to<00:02:18.040> get<00:02:18.159> it<00:02:18.250> cleaned<00:02:18.459> up<00:02:18.579> a

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879
