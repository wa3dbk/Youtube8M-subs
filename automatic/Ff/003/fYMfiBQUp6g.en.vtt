actually<00:00:55.350> may<00:00:55.500> have<00:00:55.530> caused<00:00:55.829> me<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.219> make<00:00:56.370> an

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
actually may have caused me to make an

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.180 
actually may have caused me to make an
air<00:00:56.670> yeah<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.840> think<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.230> mix<00:00:58.710> them<00:00:58.890> up<00:00:58.980> just

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
air yeah I think it mix them up just

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.840 
air yeah I think it mix them up just
enough<00:00:59.460> oh<00:01:00.770> but<00:01:01.770> Samus<00:01:02.219> doesn't<00:01:02.520> die<00:01:02.640> that

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
enough oh but Samus doesn't die that

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.520 
enough oh but Samus doesn't die that
easily<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.359> that's<00:01:03.539> when<00:01:03.809> this<00:01:03.930> matchup<00:01:04.379> can

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
easily and that's when this matchup can

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.730 
easily and that's when this matchup can
get<00:01:04.680> very<00:01:04.920> difficult<00:01:05.430> yeah<00:01:06.060> but<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.720> good<00:01:07.590> the
