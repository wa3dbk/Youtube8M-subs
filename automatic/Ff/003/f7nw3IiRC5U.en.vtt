00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.759

 boils we will add spices in 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:42.470
 this water is for making marinade for 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:43.480
 cooking squid we will use 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.850

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.879
 to spicy squid 

00:00:56.119 --> 00:01:02.600
 you can use dill fresh or 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:07.700
 frozen somewhat but this 56 can 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:12.759
 be 8 black peas peas 2 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:15.439
 leaves of laurel can be broken and 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:17.240
 about a tablespoon of vinegar but this 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:18.710
 you can taste it already 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:24.320
 when we boil 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:25.600
 our marinade marinade we boil we take 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:31.960
 sypim there 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:39.289
 peas farther on bay leaf 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:44.499

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:47.950
 and 2 spoons of salt 

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:47.950
 something like this 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:02:05.690
 and stir our boil a little bit should 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.929
 formula to taste just not 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.520
 burn yourself because the water is boiling well 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.510
 and to your taste you can add either 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.990
 a little sugar and 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:18.080
 either salt well not rearranged and because 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:21.650
 squid he is the same and paint the furnace he 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.010

 boil cover can not be covered 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.050
 maybe less but just a little bit 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.540
 the smell of these spices is more accurate to 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.440
 Marina enjoyed the smell 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:46.670
