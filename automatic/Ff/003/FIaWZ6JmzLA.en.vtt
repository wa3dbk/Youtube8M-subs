00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.150 
don't have it ah right next to the
nuclear<00:02:53.260> I<00:02:53.290> think<00:02:53.500> I'm<00:02:53.590> one<00:02:53.740> off<00:02:53.890> at<00:02:54.040> this

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
nuclear I think I'm one off at this

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.640 
nuclear I think I'm one off at this
point<00:02:54.370> so<00:02:54.520> I'm<00:02:54.610> like<00:02:54.730> shit<00:02:55.240> but<00:02:55.930> yeah<00:02:56.080> there<00:02:56.560> we

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
point so I'm like shit but yeah there we

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.190 
point so I'm like shit but yeah there we
go<00:02:56.680> nuclear<00:02:57.250> Collin<00:02:57.820> Collin<00:02:58.240> Collin<00:02:58.750> you

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
go nuclear Collin Collin Collin you

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.960 
go nuclear Collin Collin Collin you
can't<00:02:59.410> call<00:02:59.590> it<00:02:59.680> in<00:02:59.740> dikit<00:03:00.070> and<00:03:00.280> but<00:03:00.700> then<00:03:00.850> I'm

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
can't call it in dikit and but then I'm

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.370 
can't call it in dikit and but then I'm
getting<00:03:01.180> get<00:03:01.300> a<00:03:01.330> few<00:03:01.480> unstoppable<00:03:01.990> so<00:03:02.170> it's<00:03:02.320> a

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
getting get a few unstoppable so it's a

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.750 
getting get a few unstoppable so it's a
lot<00:03:02.530> of<00:03:02.560> gun<00:03:02.740> feels<00:03:02.950> it's<00:03:03.100> all<00:03:03.280> action<00:03:03.490> it's

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
lot of gun feels it's all action it's

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.730 
lot of gun feels it's all action it's
prosperously<00:03:04.600> I<00:03:04.930> think<00:03:05.230> this<00:03:05.290> is<00:03:05.350> what<00:03:05.590> makes

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
prosperously I think this is what makes

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.949 
prosperously I think this is what makes
this<00:03:05.920> my<00:03:06.250> probably<00:03:07.120> best<00:03:07.180> nuclear<00:03:07.720> today<00:03:07.900> so

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
this my probably best nuclear today so

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.270 
this my probably best nuclear today so
I'd<00:03:08.170> really<00:03:08.500> appreciate<00:03:08.560> your<00:03:08.920> getting<00:03:09.040> guys
