00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.020
 who is interested in tablets 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.260
 for the moment, I am sure of interest in how 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.280
 you have it 8 and windows located 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:17.439
 Nonetheless, of course, there are also 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:21.230
 new devices with android like this one 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:23.439
 mediapad 10 fh.de that we to the test 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.960
 have received 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:29.529
 The product name may already be guessed 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.939
 let fh d stands for full hd display 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:35.390
 the special feature is that 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:38.299
 robbie here a high-resolution full hd 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.900
 Display has only been installed so far 

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:43.879
 few manufacturers done so shows 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.360
 how ambitious that is 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.320
 Chinese company is as 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.739
 operating system 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.339
 the opponent android 4.0 must there 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.930
 you look like it looks like updates 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:59.780
 the whole thing is definitely in one 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.890
 look pretty white cardboard 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:07.420
 we had objectively hidden cables 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:11.890
 on the back the core specification 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:15.770
 the display even with 1920 x 1200 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.450
 resolution and an ips-panel that is 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.940
 It should be relatively stable 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.670
 his 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.920
 the processor is in here 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.700
 comes from Broadway itself a processor 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:32.620
 with four cores and 1 2 gigahertz 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:35.150
 clock rate should be so too 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.740
 provide enough power to 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:41.020
 this high resolution display too 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:44.659
 fire camera with 8 megapixels 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.560
 Also there seems to be competition 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.909
 to orient 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:52.850
 asus also installed one as high 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:56.470
 resolution camera and that's natural 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.850
 Not too bad an aluminum case 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.760
 because you can hope that the relative 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.560
 quality affects the MediaPad 3g that 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.510
 we tested a long time ago 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.569
 also stuck to an aluminum housing 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.840
 and that has a really good impression 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.840
 made 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.930
 the hammer the tablet still in one 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.939
 plastic film wrapped 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.609
 we want to take a moment to the side 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:24.530
 lay and listen to us that further 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:28.260
 look at 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:32.700
 no big surprise a thinner 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.840
 quickstart guide the power supply and the 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.680
 charge resp 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.120
 USB cable that can be used either 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.969
 Be the tablet to the computer 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.819
 to connect or you can use the usb 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:48.709
 plug in the power supply and plug it in 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.709
 then use a charging cable 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:02.329
 Resolve plastic cover 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:11.180
 the photo page is of course from the display 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:14.849
 taken by camera 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.949
 that does not surprise us positively 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:24.840
 surprised how slim that is 

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:28.319
 device fails and also how high quality 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:31.790
 the whole thing is almost the area 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:34.650
 So completely made of aluminum 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.729
 the edges are rounded that is 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.889
 does not cut in 

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:39.239
 with some other aluminum tablets 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:42.930
 I already have a bit of problems there 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:45.389
 with the upper area a white one 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.919
 plastic strips we find that you 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:49.769
 quite chic and it is natural 

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:52.409
 also practically because so sure 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.720
 Will that be the wireless connectivity 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:57.870
 not affected by aluminum 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:03.269
 up here then also the camera 8 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:06.870
 megapixel with led flash speaker 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:08.220
 radiate backwards that's called 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.829
 The tablet is not necessarily on the 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:15.180
 if you have a good table 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:19.670
 Otherwise, audio quality will be the same here 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:23.250
 the volume rocker and a switch 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:26.520
 on the side then the 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:30.000
 headphone jack and on the 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:32.850
 bottom the connection for the data 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.600
 or charging cable very interesting left and 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:38.940
 on the right we have two openings left 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.410
 where a keyboard dock is connected 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.770
 We can have the keyboard dock 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.300
 seen on the ifa before us and 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.220
 synonymous something can play around with it 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.580
 so far it is not offered 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.900
 we are curious if this will follow 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.210
 So it has to do with Transformers year 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.220
 front and side keyboard dock 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:00.330
 yes very useful 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:02.540
 But you have to let's see how here at 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.990
 he looks 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:12.600
 on the top then something hidden 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:14.310
 there is still an opening here for the 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.479
 micro sd cards 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:21.830
 that means the built-in memory 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:24.330
 can be extended if necessary 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.540
 mobile internet is in the version 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:30.810
 unfortunately not supported is the 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:31.530
 iphone variant but maybe he will come 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.380
 something after 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.750
 as I said the mediapad 3g that we 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.880
 already had in the test 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:43.200
 that of course has the name betrayed 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:46.919
 but mobile internet also supports 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:48.710
 so that's a very interesting device 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:53.990
 especially because of the high resolution 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:58.080
 screen and high-quality housing 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:06:00.870
 for the price of 420 euro it is natural 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.970
 not a bargain but given the 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:07.020
 equipment thoroughly to compete 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:09.390
 priced as the mediapad 10 fh.de 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.710
 then we will beat in practice 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:12.570
 of course in a detailed test 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:14.820
 still find out 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:18.229
 there is also a test video what 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:18.229
 the device shows again in use
