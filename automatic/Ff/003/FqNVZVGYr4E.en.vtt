00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:42.109 
grass clippings I'm just going to cover

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:44.080 
grass clippings I'm just going to cover
the<00:02:42.260> whole<00:02:42.410> thing<00:02:42.440> is<00:02:42.829> grasping<00:02:43.370> things<00:02:43.549> when

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
the whole thing is grasping things when

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.059 
the whole thing is grasping things when
I<00:02:44.180> finish<00:02:44.480> doing<00:02:44.630> this<00:02:44.930> so<00:02:45.650> what<00:02:45.799> are<00:02:45.920> those

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
I finish doing this so what are those

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.590 
I finish doing this so what are those
I'm<00:02:46.310> a<00:02:46.370> taken<00:02:46.870> for<00:02:47.870> fish<00:02:48.140> out<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:50.120> sky<00:02:50.390> all

I'm a taken for fish out the sky all

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.910 
I'm a taken for fish out the sky all
that<00:02:50.780> time<00:02:51.640> eat<00:02:52.640> the<00:02:52.790> other<00:02:52.910> fish<00:02:53.299> on<00:02:53.569> the<00:02:53.690> ice

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
that time eat the other fish on the ice

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.819 
that time eat the other fish on the ice
getting<00:02:54.920> cool<00:02:55.280> and<00:02:56.090> it's<00:02:56.750> fully<00:02:56.989> at<00:02:57.140> 450<00:02:57.739> the

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
getting cool and it's fully at 450 the

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.000 
getting cool and it's fully at 450 the
time<00:02:58.040> and<00:02:58.480> scale<00:02:59.480> them<00:02:59.720> and<00:02:59.900> then<00:03:00.049> filter<00:03:00.799> them

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
time and scale them and then filter them

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.940 
time and scale them and then filter them
and<00:03:02.019> add<00:03:03.019> them<00:03:03.049> into<00:03:03.260> pieces<00:03:03.530> and<00:03:03.920> then

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
and add them into pieces and then

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.699 
and add them into pieces and then
trimming<00:03:04.370> the<00:03:04.459> breather<00:03:05.139> so<00:03:06.139> we'll<00:03:06.380> come<00:03:06.530> back

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
trimming the breather so we'll come back

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.080 
trimming the breather so we'll come back
when<00:03:06.859> we're<00:03:07.069> ready<00:03:07.340> to<00:03:07.700> put<00:03:07.850> them<00:03:07.940> in<00:03:08.000> the

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
when we're ready to put them in the

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.150 
when we're ready to put them in the
freezer<00:03:08.299> but<00:03:08.900> I<00:03:09.170> feel<00:03:09.410> that<00:03:09.440> if<00:03:09.650> that<00:03:09.829> is<00:03:09.950> for

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
freezer but I feel that if that is for

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.650 
freezer but I feel that if that is for
fish<00:03:10.459> and<00:03:12.310> took<00:03:13.310> the<00:03:13.489> two<00:03:13.670> the<00:03:14.000> two<00:03:14.030> larger

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
fish and took the two the two larger

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:15.920 
fish and took the two the two larger
heads<00:03:14.900> off<00:03:15.109> to<00:03:15.500> make

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
heads off to make

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.979 
heads off to make
the<00:03:16.019> fish<00:03:16.739> curry<00:03:17.069> fish<00:03:17.549> head<00:03:17.730> curry<00:03:17.760> and<00:03:18.599> we've

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
the fish curry fish head curry and we've

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.640 
the fish curry fish head curry and we've
also<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.590> last<00:03:19.799> month<00:03:20.129> we<00:03:21.109> realized<00:03:22.109> how<00:03:22.409> good

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
also the last month we realized how good

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.720 
also the last month we realized how good
these<00:03:22.859> Thai<00:03:23.670> inspired<00:03:24.560> lemongrass<00:03:25.560> and<00:03:25.920> prawn

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
these Thai inspired lemongrass and prawn

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.089 
these Thai inspired lemongrass and prawn
soup<00:03:27.209> is<00:03:27.450> so<00:03:27.780> we're<00:03:28.349> going<00:03:28.500> to<00:03:28.620> we've<00:03:28.890> been

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
soup is so we're going to we've been

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.369 
soup is so we're going to we've been
making<00:03:29.400> a<00:03:29.519> fish<00:03:29.730> stock<00:03:29.969> with<00:03:30.629> the<00:03:30.810> fish<00:03:31.019> brains

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379 
making a fish stock with the fish brains

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:35.990 
making a fish stock with the fish brains
and<00:03:32.209> they'll<00:03:33.209> put<00:03:33.569> the<00:03:33.719> smaller<00:03:34.379> fish<00:03:35.000> brains

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
and they'll put the smaller fish brains

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.199 
and they'll put the smaller fish brains
in<00:03:36.299> the<00:03:36.389> bag<00:03:36.599> there<00:03:36.870> to<00:03:37.019> freeze<00:03:37.319> and<00:03:39.049> so<00:03:40.049> the

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
in the bag there to freeze and so the

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.759 
in the bag there to freeze and so the
the<00:03:42.209> smaller<00:03:42.510> fish<00:03:42.870> you've<00:03:43.139> got<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.409> head<00:03:43.620> in

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
the smaller fish you've got the head in

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.619 
the smaller fish you've got the head in
the<00:03:43.920> front<00:03:44.069> and<00:03:44.489> then<00:03:44.790> the<00:03:44.939> larger<00:03:45.299> one<00:03:45.450> chief

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
the front and then the larger one chief

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:48.259 
the front and then the larger one chief
of<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:45.900> brain<00:03:46.170> so<00:03:46.639> I'll<00:03:47.639> probably<00:03:47.879> eat<00:03:48.120> about

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
of the brain so I'll probably eat about

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.349 
of the brain so I'll probably eat about
three<00:03:48.419> bags<00:03:48.959> out<00:03:49.230> of<00:03:49.260> this<00:03:49.500> catch<00:03:49.769> and<00:03:50.359> I've

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
three bags out of this catch and I've

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:55.879 
three bags out of this catch and I've
kept<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:52.019> on<00:03:52.560> so<00:03:52.889> this<00:03:53.129> one<00:03:54.290> of<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.470> larger

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
kept the on so this one of the larger

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:58.099 
kept the on so this one of the larger
ones<00:03:55.919> are<00:03:56.340> kept<00:03:56.730> the<00:03:56.939> wing<00:03:57.180> section<00:03:57.780> in<00:03:57.930> what

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
ones are kept the wing section in what

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:00.740 
ones are kept the wing section in what
in<00:03:58.319> one<00:03:58.560> piece<00:03:58.889> so<00:03:59.159> I've<00:03:59.669> got<00:03:59.879> six<00:04:00.209> sections

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
in one piece so I've got six sections

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.530 
in one piece so I've got six sections
and<00:04:01.260> of<00:04:01.469> frozen<00:04:02.159> I've<00:04:02.669> packed<00:04:03.000> in<00:04:03.239> for<00:04:03.480> the

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
and of frozen I've packed in for the

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.619 
and of frozen I've packed in for the
freezer<00:04:03.840> and<00:04:04.349> I'll<00:04:04.590> show<00:04:04.799> you<00:04:04.829> how<00:04:05.489> I<00:04:05.549> did<00:04:05.909> the

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
freezer and I'll show you how I did the

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:08.270 
freezer and I'll show you how I did the
reason<00:04:06.930> why<00:04:07.019> I<00:04:07.049> keep<00:04:07.290> these<00:04:07.560> together<00:04:07.829> is

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
reason why I keep these together is

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.949 
reason why I keep these together is
because<00:04:08.669> there's<00:04:08.879> a<00:04:08.939> bit<00:04:09.090> more<00:04:09.120> blood<00:04:09.599> around

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
because there's a bit more blood around

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.319 
because there's a bit more blood around
the<00:04:10.079> wing<00:04:10.349> area<00:04:10.769> and<00:04:11.010> you<00:04:11.700> want<00:04:11.939> to<00:04:12.030> eat<00:04:12.150> that

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
the wing area and you want to eat that

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.179 
the wing area and you want to eat that
first<00:04:12.719> so<00:04:13.290> I'll<00:04:13.409> keep<00:04:13.620> all<00:04:13.769> the<00:04:13.980> wings

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:14.189 
first so I'll keep all the wings

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:17.870 
first so I'll keep all the wings
together<00:04:15.919> okay<00:04:16.919> so<00:04:16.979> I'm<00:04:17.190> just<00:04:17.370> going<00:04:17.549> to<00:04:17.669> show

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
together okay so I'm just going to show

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.420 
together okay so I'm just going to show
you<00:04:17.910> what<00:04:18.630> I<00:04:18.660> do<00:04:18.810> with<00:04:19.049> a<00:04:19.199> spill<00:04:19.650> it's<00:04:19.799> the

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
you what I do with a spill it's the

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.350 
you what I do with a spill it's the
4life<00:04:21.419> reason<00:04:21.959> so<00:04:22.889> what<00:04:23.099> to<00:04:23.220> do<00:04:23.400> is<00:04:23.610> you<00:04:23.880> you

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
4life reason so what to do is you you

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.310 
4life reason so what to do is you you
fill<00:04:24.659> with<00:04:24.780> them<00:04:24.930> and<00:04:26.120> get<00:04:27.120> them<00:04:27.240> really<00:04:27.360> ready

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
fill with them and get them really ready

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.770 
fill with them and get them really ready
to<00:04:28.470> cook<00:04:28.650> so<00:04:29.039> what<00:04:29.880> we'll<00:04:30.060> do<00:04:30.270> is<00:04:30.300> put<00:04:30.389> a<00:04:30.570> layer

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
to cook so what we'll do is put a layer

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.050 
to cook so what we'll do is put a layer
of<00:04:30.810> blade<00:04:31.260> wrap<00:04:31.560> on<00:04:31.710> the<00:04:31.830> table<00:04:32.280> and<00:04:32.430> just<00:04:32.490> put

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
of blade wrap on the table and just put

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.600 
of blade wrap on the table and just put
well<00:04:33.840> there's<00:04:34.050> two<00:04:34.229> of<00:04:34.409> us<00:04:34.590> so<00:04:35.010> we<00:04:35.190> have<00:04:35.370> two

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
well there's two of us so we have two

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.330 
well there's two of us so we have two
pieces<00:04:36.090> one<00:04:36.360> piece<00:04:36.659> each<00:04:36.900> so<00:04:37.169> we<00:04:37.199> just<00:04:37.560> put

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
pieces one piece each so we just put

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.810 
pieces one piece each so we just put
them<00:04:38.400> in<00:04:38.520> layers<00:04:38.789> so<00:04:39.780> I<00:04:39.810> just<00:04:40.169> put<00:04:40.409> two<00:04:41.220> two

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
them in layers so I just put two two

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.140 
them in layers so I just put two two
pieces<00:04:42.300> there<00:04:42.539> and<00:04:42.840> then<00:04:43.440> just<00:04:43.880> drag<00:04:44.880> it<00:04:45.060> over

over there and then put another two
pieces<00:04:51.599> I<00:04:52.039> think<00:04:53.039> some<00:04:53.460> people<00:04:53.759> call<00:04:53.940> these

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.310 
pieces I think some people call these
filets<00:04:54.979> so<00:04:56.419> anyway<00:04:57.419> we<00:04:57.630> call<00:04:57.810> them<00:04:57.960> Phillips

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
filets so anyway we call them Phillips

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.990

so you've got another till you fill its
head<00:05:00.240> and<00:05:00.570> then<00:05:01.199> you<00:05:01.380> fold<00:05:01.889> it<00:05:02.130> back<00:05:02.340> and<00:05:02.610> then

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:14.540 

and<00:05:10.319> then<00:05:10.560> you<00:05:10.710> fold<00:05:10.949> it<00:05:11.190> over<00:05:11.430> again<00:05:13.550> like

and then you fold it over again like

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.719 
and then you fold it over again like
