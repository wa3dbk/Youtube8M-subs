 reconstruction of the old building that in its day pretends to be a 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.080
 but that currently will be trying to convert so that it has 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.529

 fish with riparian vegetation invertebrate colomer amend the 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.330
 bullfighters a little bit that ecosystem concept 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.590
 and that fishing is compatible with conservation and that we form 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.070
 part of that ecosystem and therefore we should also 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.380
 get involved in the conservation of it 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.630

 fishing that is called what the cane is the parts that it has as we launch and 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.410
 above all it is very interesting to transmit the subject and capture and release the ends of 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.300
