00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
you made us even right away that the

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.090 
you made us even right away that the
water<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:06.869> going<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.140> start<00:01:07.320> getting<00:01:07.470> thicker

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
water is going to start getting thicker

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.310 
water is going to start getting thicker
but<00:01:08.580> here's<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.210> trick<00:01:09.540> so<00:01:09.869> what<00:01:10.020> we're<00:01:10.170> going

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
but here's the trick so what we're going

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.899 
but here's the trick so what we're going
to<00:01:10.380> do<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.830> we're<00:01:11.040> actually<00:01:11.159> going<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.640> set

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
to do is we're actually going to set

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.249 
to do is we're actually going to set
this<00:01:12.119> in<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:13.020> frigerator<00:01:13.950> for<00:01:14.729> about<00:01:15.259> at

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
this in the frigerator for about at

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.730 
this in the frigerator for about at
least<00:01:16.590> about<00:01:17.250> an<00:01:17.369> hour<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:18.090> two<00:01:18.299> hours<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.869> the

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
least about an hour to two hours and the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.340 
least about an hour to two hours and the
easiest<00:01:20.070> way<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.310> do<00:01:20.520> this<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.880> actually<00:01:21.630> set

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
easiest way to do this is actually set

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.190 
easiest way to do this is actually set
in<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.619> fridge<00:01:22.860> for<00:01:23.220> overnight<00:01:23.540> so<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.570> let

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
in the fridge for overnight so I let

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.590 
in the fridge for overnight so I let
these<00:01:25.470> chia<00:01:25.830> seeds<00:01:26.220> stay<00:01:26.729> in<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.330> jar

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
these chia seeds stay in the jar

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.480 
these chia seeds stay in the jar
overnight<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.829> can<00:01:29.009> see<00:01:29.220> they're

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
overnight and you can see they're

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.090 
overnight and you can see they're
actually<00:01:29.670> really<00:01:30.329> thick<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:31.680> we're<00:01:31.860> almost

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
actually really thick and we're almost

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.190 
actually really thick and we're almost
to<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.700> consistency<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.570> pudding<00:01:33.990> and

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
to the consistency of pudding and

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.510 
to the consistency of pudding and
actually<00:01:34.560> some<00:01:34.710> people<00:01:34.829> actually<00:01:35.220> make<00:01:35.369> these

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
actually some people actually make these

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.679 
actually some people actually make these
a<00:01:35.579> pudding<00:01:36.049> so<00:01:37.049> this<00:01:37.560> getting<00:01:37.890> about<00:01:38.100> um<00:01:39.030> I

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
a pudding so this getting about um I

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.600 
a pudding so this getting about um I
would<00:01:40.049> say<00:01:40.170> two<00:01:40.229> servings<00:01:40.890> if<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.189> want<00:01:41.430> you

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
would say two servings if you want you

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.100 
would say two servings if you want you
can<00:01:41.759> even<00:01:41.820> split<00:01:42.060> up<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.390> three<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:42.780> depends<00:01:42.990> on

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
can even split up to three it depends on

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.230 
can even split up to three it depends on
how<00:01:43.350> thick<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.950> like<00:01:43.979> your<00:01:44.159> dream<00:01:44.520> if<00:01:44.970> you've
