so<00:00:00.719> this<00:00:00.900> is<00:00:01.050> them<00:00:01.199> very<00:00:01.469> lighting<00:00:01.920> using<00:00:02.250> the

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
so this is them very lighting using the

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:14.470 
so this is them very lighting using the
wind<00:00:02.550> to<00:00:02.970> turn<00:00:03.179> across<00:00:11.540> the<00:00:12.540> winds<00:00:12.719> behind<00:00:12.929> him

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 
wind to turn across the winds behind him

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.919 
wind to turn across the winds behind him
what<00:00:15.480> he's<00:00:15.599> doing

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
what he's doing

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.660 
what he's doing
just<00:00:16.139> angled<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.560> boat<00:00:16.740> so<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.100> wind<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:17.460> now

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
just angled the boat so the wind is now

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.220 
just angled the boat so the wind is now
pushing<00:00:17.970> on<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.270> starboard<00:00:18.720> port<00:00:18.930> for<00:00:19.199> the

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
pushing on the starboard port for the

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.240 
pushing on the starboard port for the
boat<00:00:19.470> which<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:20.609> just<00:00:20.910> pushing<00:00:21.359> her<00:00:21.390> in<00:00:21.600> gently

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250 
boat which is just pushing her in gently

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.620 
boat which is just pushing her in gently
and<00:00:23.250> towards<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.760> jetties<00:00:24.119> you<00:00:24.269> can<00:00:24.449> see

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
and towards the jetties you can see

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.570 
and towards the jetties you can see
she's<00:00:24.810> just<00:00:24.840> starting<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.619> slide<00:00:25.859> in<00:00:26.099> quite

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
she's just starting to slide in quite

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.120 
she's just starting to slide in quite
nicely<00:00:27.109> parallel<00:00:28.109> so<00:00:28.500> if<00:00:28.800> you've<00:00:28.980> ever

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
nicely parallel so if you've ever

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.690 
nicely parallel so if you've ever
wondered<00:00:29.310> this<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:29.789> how<00:00:32.780> using<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.899> wind

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
wondered this is how using the wind

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.049 
wondered this is how using the wind
people<00:00:35.700> simply<00:00:35.940> can't<00:00:37.460> considering<00:00:38.460> this<00:00:38.879> is

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
people simply can't considering this is

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.970

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
quite very good job of it he's a little

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.410 
quite very good job of it he's a little
bit<00:00:52.530> too<00:00:52.710> much<00:00:52.860> throttle<00:00:53.100> there<00:00:53.430> it's<00:00:54.120> not<00:00:54.270> the

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
bit too much throttle there it's not the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.910 
bit too much throttle there it's not the
point<00:00:54.690> uses<00:00:54.989> Planeta<00:00:55.440> forwards<00:00:57.710> it's<00:00:58.710> just

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
point uses Planeta forwards it's just

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.090 
point uses Planeta forwards it's just
doesn't<00:00:59.070> get<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.579> little<00:00:59.850> bit<00:00:59.969> sticky<00:01:00.899> on<00:01:01.170> these

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.710 

but<00:01:05.100> because<00:01:05.400> we're<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:05.850> now<00:01:06.090> behind<00:01:06.390> these

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
but because we're is now behind these

but because we're is now behind these
boats<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.290> winds<00:01:07.500> slowly<00:01:07.710> disappear

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:37.390 

now<00:01:18.950> see<00:01:19.720> hopefully<00:01:20.980> speak<00:01:21.980> to<00:01:22.130> please<00:01:36.400> hold

on guys
parallel<00:01:39.800> parking<00:01:40.100> booth<00:01:42.340> so<00:01:43.340> this<00:01:43.490> time<00:01:43.730> in

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
parallel parking booth so this time in

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.100 
parallel parking booth so this time in
Reverse<00:01:44.150> what<00:01:44.390> he's<00:01:44.510> going<00:01:44.630> to<00:01:44.690> do<00:01:44.840> is<00:01:44.960> just

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
Reverse what he's going to do is just

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.660 
Reverse what he's going to do is just
finish<00:01:45.260> positioning<00:01:46.220> the<00:01:46.310> engine<00:01:46.550> out

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
finish positioning the engine out

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.140 
finish positioning the engine out
slightly<00:01:46.970> into<00:01:47.630> the<00:01:47.720> wind<00:01:48.250> and<00:01:49.250> then<00:01:49.790> the<00:01:49.970> wind

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
slightly into the wind and then the wind

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.970 
slightly into the wind and then the wind
will<00:01:50.210> transfer<00:01:50.780> to<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:51.020> port<00:01:51.380> quarter<00:01:51.620> at<00:01:51.920> the

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:51.980 
will transfer to the port quarter at the

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.550 
will transfer to the port quarter at the
back<00:01:52.540> as<00:01:53.540> you<00:01:53.570> can<00:01:53.750> see<00:01:53.930> there<00:01:54.080> the<00:01:54.230> boat<00:01:54.380> is

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
back as you can see there the boat is

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.870 
back as you can see there the boat is
now<00:01:54.740> just<00:01:54.950> pushing<00:01:55.310> starting<00:01:55.670> to<00:01:55.730> push

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
now just pushing starting to push

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.490 
now just pushing starting to push
sideways<00:01:56.120> so<00:01:56.450> the<00:01:56.510> boat<00:01:56.750> will<00:01:56.900> always<00:01:57.290> always

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
sideways so the boat will always always

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.030 
sideways so the boat will always always
go<00:01:57.830> sideways<00:01:58.130> in<00:01:58.460> the<00:01:58.490> wind<00:01:59.620> so<00:02:00.620> has<00:02:00.740> the<00:02:00.860> boat

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
go sideways in the wind so has the boat

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.890 
go sideways in the wind so has the boat
slides<00:02:01.370> in<00:02:01.490> a<00:02:01.550> way<00:02:01.670> what<00:02:02.240> he<00:02:02.300> can<00:02:02.510> do<00:02:02.660> is<00:02:02.780> you

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
slides in a way what he can do is you

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.530 
slides in a way what he can do is you
can<00:02:03.050> have<00:02:03.170> straighten<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.620> engine<00:02:03.890> slightly

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
can have straighten the engine slightly

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.640 
can have straighten the engine slightly
touch<00:02:05.540> the<00:02:05.690> reverse<00:02:05.960> and<00:02:06.230> that<00:02:06.410> will<00:02:06.560> just

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
touch the reverse and that will just

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.880 
touch the reverse and that will just
pull<00:02:06.890> over<00:02:07.010> for<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:07.460> nose<00:02:07.640> round<00:02:08.890> nicely

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890
