marley<00:02:25.760> here<00:02:26.000> it<00:02:26.120> felt<00:02:26.360> like<00:02:26.830> just<00:02:27.830> like<00:02:27.920> a

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
marley here it felt like just like a

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.370 
marley here it felt like just like a
softer<00:02:28.610> version<00:02:28.790> of<00:02:29.150> it<00:02:29.269> and<00:02:29.510> it<00:02:30.019> was<00:02:30.170> very

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
softer version of it and it was very

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.070 
softer version of it and it was very
smooth<00:02:31.280> but<00:02:31.610> I<00:02:31.790> have<00:02:32.060> to<00:02:32.239> use<00:02:32.420> the<00:02:32.450> Marla<00:02:32.870> hair

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
smooth but I have to use the Marla hair

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.530 
smooth but I have to use the Marla hair
in<00:02:33.200> order<00:02:33.350> to<00:02:33.560> connect<00:02:34.550> my<00:02:34.730> hair<00:02:34.970> with<00:02:35.239> or

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
in order to connect my hair with or

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.720 
in order to connect my hair with or
attach<00:02:35.989> it<00:02:36.170> to<00:02:36.200> my<00:02:36.350> hair<00:02:36.680> because<00:02:36.860> it<00:02:37.220> was<00:02:37.550> very

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
attach it to my hair because it was very

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.300 
attach it to my hair because it was very
smooth<00:02:38.120> and<00:02:38.300> slippery<00:02:38.690> and<00:02:38.870> it<00:02:38.989> bounced<00:02:39.590> a<00:02:39.890> lot

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
smooth and slippery and it bounced a lot

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.460 
smooth and slippery and it bounced a lot
so<00:02:40.670> it<00:02:41.000> was<00:02:41.150> hard<00:02:41.180> for<00:02:41.450> me<00:02:41.600> to<00:02:41.780> just<00:02:41.810> attach<00:02:42.290> it

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
so it was hard for me to just attach it

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.310 
so it was hard for me to just attach it
to<00:02:42.500> my<00:02:42.620> hair<00:02:42.950> so<00:02:43.850> we'll<00:02:44.120> show<00:02:44.330> you<00:02:44.360> guys<00:02:44.570> what

percent<00:02:53.420> dry<00:02:54.019> hair<00:02:54.380> and<00:02:55.370> then<00:02:55.519> I<00:02:55.550> just<00:02:55.850> add

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
percent dry hair and then I just add

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.259 
percent dry hair and then I just add
some<00:02:56.420> coconut<00:02:57.320> oil<00:02:57.680> on<00:02:57.950> my<00:02:58.130> ends<00:02:58.610> and<00:02:58.820> then

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
I'll just separate the two pieces but

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.250 
I'll just separate the two pieces but
first<00:03:01.310> thing<00:03:01.489> I<00:03:01.580> do<00:03:01.640> is<00:03:01.760> just<00:03:02.120> get<00:03:02.269> my<00:03:02.480> weave

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
first thing I do is just get my weave

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.890 
first thing I do is just get my weave
piece<00:03:03.530> which<00:03:03.769> is<00:03:03.800> the<00:03:04.190> Marley<00:03:05.030> hair<00:03:05.239> and<00:03:05.510> then

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
piece which is the Marley hair and then

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.080 
piece which is the Marley hair and then
I<00:03:05.989> just<00:03:06.170> twist<00:03:06.470> the<00:03:06.650> top<00:03:06.860> and<00:03:07.160> then<00:03:07.580> I<00:03:07.700> work<00:03:07.970> it

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
I just twist the top and then I work it

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.229 
I just twist the top and then I work it
in<00:03:08.269> to<00:03:08.810> my<00:03:08.959> hair<00:03:09.200> which<00:03:09.410> I<00:03:09.620> twist<00:03:09.980> over<00:03:10.239> about

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.610 
in to my hair which I twist over about
twice<00:03:11.600> so<00:03:12.560> that<00:03:12.709> it<00:03:12.890> can<00:03:13.100> be<00:03:13.250> locked<00:03:13.630> and<00:03:14.630> then

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
twice so that it can be locked and then

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.680 
twice so that it can be locked and then
I<00:03:15.709> take<00:03:15.920> the<00:03:16.130> shorter<00:03:16.489> piece<00:03:16.700> and<00:03:16.970> I<00:03:17.030> just<00:03:17.239> put

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
to wrap it around the roots so won't

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.020

hair with the Marley hair I'm not

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.370 
hair with the Marley hair I'm not
separating<00:03:31.430> the<00:03:31.550> Marley<00:03:31.880> hair<00:03:32.060> until<00:03:32.300> I<00:03:32.900> get

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
separating the Marley hair until I get

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.309 
separating the Marley hair until I get
to<00:03:33.410> the<00:03:33.680> end<00:03:33.830> of<00:03:34.459> my<00:03:34.490> hair<00:03:35.030> so<00:03:35.330> so<00:03:36.080> that<00:03:36.200> I<00:03:36.260> can

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 
to the end of my hair so so that I can

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.090 
to the end of my hair so so that I can
blend<00:03:36.560> it<00:03:36.830> with<00:03:37.040> the<00:03:37.670> rest<00:03:37.940> but<00:03:38.569> when<00:03:38.750> i<00:03:38.780> do

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
blend it with the rest but when i do

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.130 
blend it with the rest but when i do
into<00:03:40.100> my<00:03:40.220> hair<00:03:40.520> that's<00:03:40.790> why<00:03:40.970> i<00:03:41.240> will<00:03:41.630> end<00:03:41.870> the

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
into my hair that's why i will end the

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:45.720 
into my hair that's why i will end the
braid<00:03:42.880> and<00:03:43.880> i<00:03:44.569> won't<00:03:44.780> go<00:03:44.959> all<00:03:45.140> the<00:03:45.260> way<00:03:45.290> down

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
braid and i won't go all the way down

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.280 
braid and i won't go all the way down
because<00:03:46.730> the<00:03:47.090> rest<00:03:47.360> of<00:03:47.510> the<00:03:47.600> Marley<00:03:47.930> hair<00:03:48.140> is

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
because the rest of the Marley hair is

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.830 
because the rest of the Marley hair is
going<00:03:48.560> to<00:03:48.680> be<00:03:48.800> used<00:03:49.550> to<00:03:49.790> wrap<00:03:50.000> around<00:03:50.209> the

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
going to be used to wrap around the

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.830 
going to be used to wrap around the
dread<00:03:51.350> so<00:03:51.980> I'm<00:03:52.850> going<00:03:52.910> to<00:03:53.090> add<00:03:53.239> the<00:03:53.450> dread<00:03:53.720> in

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
dread so I'm going to add the dread in

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.300 
dread so I'm going to add the dread in
and<00:03:54.020> I'm<00:03:54.110> just<00:03:54.260> going<00:03:54.380> to<00:03:54.470> do<00:03:54.620> the<00:03:54.739> same<00:03:54.950> method

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
and I'm just going to do the same method

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.880 
and I'm just going to do the same method
i<00:03:55.400> did<00:03:55.610> just<00:03:55.640> wrap<00:03:56.090> the<00:03:56.300> root<00:03:56.510> around<00:03:56.690> a<00:03:57.350> few

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
i did just wrap the root around a few

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.680 
i did just wrap the root around a few
times<00:03:57.950> so<00:03:58.519> that<00:03:58.550> it<00:03:58.820> stays<00:03:59.120> and<00:03:59.450> then<00:03:59.570> i'm<00:03:59.660> just

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
times so that it stays and then i'm just

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.030 
times so that it stays and then i'm just
going<00:03:59.959> to<00:04:00.019> wrap<00:04:00.260> it<00:04:00.430> wrap<00:04:01.430> the<00:04:02.290> root<00:04:03.290> Marley

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
going to wrap it wrap the root Marley

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.880 
going to wrap it wrap the root Marley
hair<00:04:04.280> and<00:04:04.580> just<00:04:04.790> wrap<00:04:04.970> it<00:04:05.000> around<00:04:05.209> the<00:04:05.480> piece

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
hair and just wrap it around the piece

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.830 
hair and just wrap it around the piece
so<00:04:06.890> basically<00:04:07.880> I'm<00:04:08.090> not<00:04:08.239> going<00:04:08.510> to<00:04:08.570> be<00:04:08.660> adding

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
so basically I'm not going to be adding

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.900 
so basically I'm not going to be adding
any<00:04:09.410> more<00:04:09.500> hair<00:04:09.980> after<00:04:10.310> that<00:04:10.459> i'm<00:04:10.610> just<00:04:10.670> going

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
any more hair after that i'm just going

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.490 
any more hair after that i'm just going
to<00:04:10.970> keep<00:04:11.090> wrapping<00:04:11.569> until<00:04:11.690> i<00:04:11.900> get<00:04:11.959> to<00:04:12.140> the<00:04:12.350> very

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
to keep wrapping until i get to the very

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.199 
to keep wrapping until i get to the very
bottom<00:04:12.739> and<00:04:13.010> then<00:04:13.130> start<00:04:13.400> rapping<00:04:13.730> again<00:04:13.819> with

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
bottom and then start rapping again with

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:15.940 
bottom and then start rapping again with
the<00:04:14.630> rest<00:04:14.870> of<00:04:14.959> the<00:04:15.080> Marley<00:04:15.380> hair<00:04:15.530> that's<00:04:15.769> on

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
the rest of the Marley hair that's on

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.670 
the rest of the Marley hair that's on
there<00:04:16.340> and<00:04:16.669> this<00:04:17.510> method<00:04:17.750> is<00:04:17.989> much<00:04:18.169> easier<00:04:18.350> for

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
there and this method is much easier for

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.469 
there and this method is much easier for
me<00:04:18.950> rather<00:04:19.100> than<00:04:19.250> having<00:04:19.669> to<00:04:19.790> finish<00:04:20.180> a<00:04:20.209> whole

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
me rather than having to finish a whole

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:22.659 
me rather than having to finish a whole
braid<00:04:20.780> and<00:04:20.989> then<00:04:21.049> wrap<00:04:21.320> it<00:04:21.350> again<00:04:21.739> and<00:04:22.010> seal<00:04:22.640> it

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
braid and then wrap it again and seal it

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.210 
braid and then wrap it again and seal it
everything<00:04:23.630> is<00:04:23.780> pretty<00:04:23.990> much<00:04:24.080> entwine<00:04:24.860> didn't

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
everything is pretty much entwine didn't

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.400 
everything is pretty much entwine didn't
want<00:04:25.370> in<00:04:25.550> each<00:04:26.090> other<00:04:26.419> so<00:04:26.750> it's<00:04:26.930> not<00:04:27.139> going<00:04:27.320> to

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
want in each other so it's not going to

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.969 
want in each other so it's not going to
unravel<00:04:27.830> easy<00:04:28.360> and<00:04:29.360> using<00:04:30.080> this<00:04:30.200> method<00:04:30.620> is<00:04:30.740> so

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
unravel easy and using this method is so

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:33.940 
unravel easy and using this method is so
much<00:04:31.160> easier<00:04:31.400> for<00:04:31.669> me<00:04:31.970> like<00:04:32.180> I<00:04:32.330> swear<00:04:32.780> the<00:04:33.740> last

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
much easier for me like I swear the last

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.950 
much easier for me like I swear the last
method<00:04:34.250> I<00:04:34.490> tried<00:04:34.790> I<00:04:34.820> tried<00:04:35.000> with<00:04:35.419> Kanekalon

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
method I tried I tried with Kanekalon

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.730 
method I tried I tried with Kanekalon
hair<00:04:36.500> and<00:04:36.770> it<00:04:36.919> just<00:04:37.100> didn't<00:04:37.370> work<00:04:37.550> it<00:04:38.090> wasn't

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
hair and it just didn't work it wasn't

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.159 
hair and it just didn't work it wasn't
kinky<00:04:39.740> enough<00:04:40.010> to<00:04:40.370> hold<00:04:40.630> and<00:04:41.630> you<00:04:41.780> had<00:04:41.930> to<00:04:42.050> like

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169 
kinky enough to hold and you had to like

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:43.690 
kinky enough to hold and you had to like
burn<00:04:42.410> the<00:04:42.560> ends<00:04:42.740> and<00:04:43.070> stuff<00:04:43.310> like<00:04:43.430> that<00:04:43.490> so

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
burn the ends and stuff like that so

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.600 
burn the ends and stuff like that so
it's<00:04:44.030> much<00:04:44.180> easier<00:04:44.210> for<00:04:44.810> me<00:04:44.960> to<00:04:45.140> do<00:04:45.770> it<00:04:45.950> and<00:04:46.130> so

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
it's much easier for me to do it and so

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.670 
it's much easier for me to do it and so
the<00:04:46.760> method<00:04:46.910> I<00:04:47.120> use<00:04:47.330> for<00:04:47.630> sealing<00:04:48.080> it<00:04:48.200> is<00:04:48.380> just

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
the method I use for sealing it is just

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:54.340 
the method I use for sealing it is just
using<00:04:48.979> a<00:04:50.380> little<00:04:51.380> mini<00:04:51.890> straightener<00:04:52.280> I<00:04:53.350> just

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
using a little mini straightener I just

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:55.900 
using a little mini straightener I just
use<00:04:54.500> the<00:04:54.650> mini<00:04:54.800> straightener<00:04:55.130> to<00:04:55.520> seal

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
use the mini straightener to seal

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.080 
use the mini straightener to seal
everything<00:04:56.870> together<00:04:57.440> and<00:04:57.890> after<00:04:58.669> doing<00:04:58.880> this

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
everything together and after doing this

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.969 
everything together and after doing this
I<00:04:59.270> actually<00:04:59.360> realized<00:04:59.780> that<00:05:00.229> adding<00:05:00.650> glue

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:00.979 
I actually realized that adding glue

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:03.159 
I actually realized that adding glue
like<00:05:01.700> hair<00:05:02.030> glue<00:05:02.270> to<00:05:02.450> the<00:05:02.479> ends<00:05:02.960> of<00:05:03.020> the<00:05:03.140> hair

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
like hair glue to the ends of the hair

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:05.170 
like hair glue to the ends of the hair
actually<00:05:03.620> seal<00:05:04.190> it<00:05:04.340> a<00:05:04.370> lot<00:05:04.700> better<00:05:04.850> and<00:05:05.120> it

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
actually seal it a lot better and it

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.790 
actually seal it a lot better and it
makes<00:05:05.210> it<00:05:05.510> look<00:05:05.660> more<00:05:05.690> like<00:05:05.990> a<00:05:06.050> dread<00:05:06.380> but

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
makes it look more like a dread but

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.350 
makes it look more like a dread but
that's<00:05:06.979> my<00:05:07.190> preference<00:05:07.550> you<00:05:07.940> don't<00:05:08.090> have<00:05:08.240> to

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
that's my preference you don't have to

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.940 
that's my preference you don't have to
do<00:05:08.510> it<00:05:08.660> if<00:05:08.750> you<00:05:08.870> don't<00:05:08.960> want<00:05:09.140> glue<00:05:09.380> on<00:05:09.590> the<00:05:09.710> hair

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:09.950 
do it if you don't want glue on the hair

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.820 
do it if you don't want glue on the hair
and<00:05:10.370> that's<00:05:10.610> your<00:05:11.180> preference<00:05:11.600> I<00:05:11.990> just<00:05:12.530> did<00:05:12.710> it

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
and that's your preference I just did it

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.710 
and that's your preference I just did it
just<00:05:13.010> to<00:05:13.070> seal<00:05:13.340> it<00:05:13.520> this<00:05:13.940> style<00:05:14.210> isn't<00:05:14.479> going

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
just to seal it this style isn't going

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.150 
just to seal it this style isn't going
to<00:05:14.780> last<00:05:14.930> long<00:05:15.229> for<00:05:15.260> me<00:05:15.590> just<00:05:15.800> because<00:05:15.830> I<00:05:16.100> know

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
to last long for me just because I know

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.890 
to last long for me just because I know
I<00:05:16.280> will<00:05:16.669> want<00:05:16.880> to<00:05:16.940> take<00:05:17.030> it<00:05:17.150> out<00:05:17.360> pretty<00:05:17.630> soon

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
I will want to take it out pretty soon

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.810 
I will want to take it out pretty soon
so<00:05:18.500> i'll<00:05:18.710> probably<00:05:18.950> leave<00:05:19.130> it<00:05:19.400> in<00:05:19.490> for<00:05:19.520> about

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
so i'll probably leave it in for about

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.180 
so i'll probably leave it in for about
two<00:05:20.060> weeks<00:05:20.090> but<00:05:20.600> that's<00:05:21.440> the<00:05:21.740> most<00:05:21.919> that<00:05:22.160> i

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
two weeks but that's the most that i

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.330 
two weeks but that's the most that i
leave<00:05:22.460> it<00:05:22.610> in<00:05:22.760> for<00:05:22.910> my<00:05:23.150> hair<00:05:23.510> on<00:05:23.690> I<00:05:24.620> don't<00:05:25.250> like

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
leave it in for my hair on I don't like

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.520 
leave it in for my hair on I don't like
doing<00:05:25.700> a<00:05:26.030> lot<00:05:26.270> to<00:05:26.510> my<00:05:26.660> hair<00:05:26.900> whenever<00:05:27.140> I<00:05:27.320> have

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
doing a lot to my hair whenever I have

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.560 
doing a lot to my hair whenever I have
braids<00:05:27.830> I<00:05:28.130> just<00:05:28.640> leave<00:05:28.789> it<00:05:28.910> in<00:05:29.060> and<00:05:29.330> then<00:05:29.419> I'll

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:29.570 
braids I just leave it in and then I'll

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.000 
braids I just leave it in and then I'll
just<00:05:29.600> take<00:05:29.930> it<00:05:30.080> out<00:05:30.169> whenever<00:05:30.440> I<00:05:30.620> want<00:05:30.800> a<00:05:30.860> new

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
just take it out whenever I want a new

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.550 
just take it out whenever I want a new
style<00:05:31.310> even<00:05:32.000> though<00:05:32.090> it<00:05:32.210> takes<00:05:32.390> me<00:05:32.690> a<00:05:33.050> little

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
style even though it takes me a little

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.800 
style even though it takes me a little
bit<00:05:33.770> of<00:05:33.950> time<00:05:34.190> to<00:05:34.460> do<00:05:34.669> my<00:05:34.849> braids<00:05:35.180> I<00:05:35.390> still

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
bit of time to do my braids I still

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.659 
bit of time to do my braids I still
don't<00:05:35.840> really<00:05:36.320> care<00:05:36.590> to<00:05:36.800> keep<00:05:37.130> it<00:05:37.280> in<00:05:37.400> for<00:05:37.640> a

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:37.669 
don't really care to keep it in for a

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:39.920 
don't really care to keep it in for a
while<00:05:37.849> so<00:05:38.510> that's<00:05:38.690> how<00:05:38.840> the<00:05:38.870> dread<00:05:39.260> looks

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
while so that's how the dread looks

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.189 
while so that's how the dread looks
all<00:05:40.650> the<00:05:40.860> way<00:05:40.979> down<00:05:41.479> you'll<00:05:42.479> see<00:05:42.600> I<00:05:42.750> like<00:05:43.080> the

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 
all the way down you'll see I like the

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:44.870 
all the way down you'll see I like the
uneven<00:05:43.770> look<00:05:43.979> just<00:05:44.220> because<00:05:44.370> it<00:05:44.610> looks<00:05:44.639> a

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
uneven look just because it looks a

I've<00:06:09.330> had<00:06:09.600> so<00:06:09.960> far<00:06:09.990> I've<00:06:10.740> never<00:06:11.130> had<00:06:11.580> last<00:06:11.940> time

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.060 
I've had so far I've never had last time

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.270 
I've had so far I've never had last time
I<00:06:12.210> decided<00:06:12.539> to<00:06:12.750> do<00:06:12.900> dreads<00:06:13.229> or<00:06:13.440> decided<00:06:13.949> to<00:06:14.099> do
