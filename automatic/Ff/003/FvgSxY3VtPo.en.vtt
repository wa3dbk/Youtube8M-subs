finally time for custom doors okay this

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.110 
finally time for custom doors okay this
will<00:00:08.910> probably<00:00:09.059> be<00:00:09.240> a<00:00:09.330> long<00:00:09.870> video<00:00:10.050> but<00:00:11.120> let's

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
will probably be a long video but let's

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.740 
will probably be a long video but let's
do<00:00:12.480> it<00:00:12.690> so<00:00:13.400> starters<00:00:14.400> these<00:00:15.120> are<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.389> pockets

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
do it so starters these are the pockets

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.330 
do it so starters these are the pockets
they're<00:00:16.020> actually<00:00:16.260> broken<00:00:16.379> on<00:00:16.650> these<00:00:16.830> another

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
they're actually broken on these another

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.710 
they're actually broken on these another
store<00:00:18.080> they're<00:00:19.080> coming<00:00:19.380> off<00:00:19.500> so<00:00:20.400> that<00:00:20.789> I<00:00:21.090> can

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
store they're coming off so that I can

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.980 
store they're coming off so that I can
put<00:00:21.900> on<00:00:22.050> my<00:00:22.260> two<00:00:22.470> focal<00:00:22.859> flacks<00:00:23.160> okay<00:00:24.060> so

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
put on my two focal flacks okay so

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.679 
put on my two focal flacks okay so

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
taking the grill off that one so that

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.269 
taking the grill off that one so that
gives<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.050> rough<00:00:28.410> idea<00:00:28.619> already<00:00:28.980> Oh

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
gives you a rough idea already Oh

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.889 
gives you a rough idea already Oh
where's<00:00:30.269> bigs<00:00:30.539> going<00:00:32.210> they<00:00:33.210> will<00:00:33.390> sit<00:00:33.630> into

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
where's bigs going they will sit into

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.810 
where's bigs going they will sit into
the<00:00:33.989> door<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.170> little<00:00:34.410> bit<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.860> don't<00:00:35.309> have<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.579> lot

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
the door a little bit I don't have a lot

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.580 
the door a little bit I don't have a lot
of<00:00:35.850> depth<00:00:36.120> in<00:00:36.300> there<00:00:36.450> pretty<00:00:36.930> much<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.320> motor

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
of depth in there pretty much the motor

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.340 
of depth in there pretty much the motor
will<00:00:37.920> be<00:00:38.070> in<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.309> door<00:00:38.550> probably<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:40.230> they

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
will be in the door probably so they

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.630 
will be in the door probably so they
will<00:00:40.500> get<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:40.770> they're<00:00:40.980> going<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.190> bulge<00:00:41.399> out

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
will get it they're going to bulge out

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.090 
will get it they're going to bulge out
quite<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.000> lot<00:00:42.410> to<00:00:43.410> fit<00:00:43.620> them<00:00:43.770> in<00:00:43.920> because

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
quite a lot to fit them in because

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.910 
quite a lot to fit them in because
they're<00:00:44.280> not<00:00:45.149> small<00:00:45.570> exactly<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.469> got<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.800> do

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
they're not small exactly I got to do

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:47.330 
they're not small exactly I got to do
now

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
now

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.130 
now
there's<00:00:47.879> my<00:00:48.059> center<00:00:48.329> point<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.690> cut<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.110> out

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
there's my center point I cut it out

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.729 
there's my center point I cut it out
with<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.440> router<00:00:50.059> outside<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.210> this<00:00:51.710> until<00:00:52.710> I

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
with a router outside of this until I

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.610 
with a router outside of this until I
get<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.129> which<00:00:53.520> gets<00:00:53.910> straight<00:00:54.440> same<00:00:55.440> on

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
get to that which gets straight same on

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.500 
get to that which gets straight same on
both<00:00:55.770> lines<00:00:56.010> then<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:56.460> actually<00:00:56.640> cut<00:00:57.270> it

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
both lines then I actually cut it

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.349 
both lines then I actually cut it
straight<00:00:57.739> okay<00:00:58.770> then<00:00:59.219> that'll<00:00:59.489> be<00:00:59.520> the

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
straight okay then that'll be the

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.360 
straight okay then that'll be the
outside<00:01:00.780> so<00:01:01.469> I've<00:01:01.559> got<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.710> nice<00:01:01.920> round<00:01:02.100> edge

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
outside so I've got a nice round edge

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.820 
outside so I've got a nice round edge
then<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.059> got<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.359> cut<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.600> inside<00:01:03.989> out<00:01:04.199> the

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
then I got to cut the inside out the

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.780 
then I got to cut the inside out the
entire<00:01:05.129> circle<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.700> both<00:01:07.490> so<00:01:08.490> they<00:01:08.610> work<00:01:08.760> just

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
entire circle and both so they work just

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.090 
entire circle and both so they work just
left<00:01:09.210> with<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.479> ring<00:01:09.750> okay<00:01:10.650> because<00:01:10.950> that

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
left with that ring okay because that

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.670 
left with that ring okay because that
ring<00:01:11.549> will<00:01:12.210> be<00:01:12.240> what's<00:01:12.659> wrapped<00:01:13.020> in<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.470> grill

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
ring will be what's wrapped in the grill

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.410 
ring will be what's wrapped in the grill
cloth<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.250> saw<00:01:14.400> me<00:01:14.520> mark<00:01:14.729> them<00:01:14.880> now<00:01:15.090> I've<00:01:15.240> cut

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
cloth you saw me mark them now I've cut

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.130 
cloth you saw me mark them now I've cut
them<00:01:15.540> out<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.380> said<00:01:16.710> that's<00:01:16.920> halfway

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
them out so I said that's halfway

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.770 
them out so I said that's halfway
roughly<00:01:19.140> on<00:01:19.290> both<00:01:19.470> move<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.430> router<00:01:20.580> okay<00:01:21.540> now

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
roughly on both move the router okay now

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.429 
roughly on both move the router okay now
I<00:01:21.810> just<00:01:22.020> use<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:23.030> like<00:01:24.030> jigsaw<00:01:24.450> straight<00:01:25.229> Alon

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
I just use a like jigsaw straight Alon

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.920 
I just use a like jigsaw straight Alon
there<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.890> nice<00:01:26.759> straight<00:01:27.060> cut<00:01:27.090> on<00:01:27.420> both<00:01:27.570> and

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
there a nice straight cut on both and

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.380 
there a nice straight cut on both and
I've<00:01:28.080> got<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.259> perfect<00:01:28.710> oval<00:01:28.920> but<00:01:29.909> while<00:01:30.180> it's

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
I've got a perfect oval but while it's

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.940 
I've got a perfect oval but while it's
still<00:01:30.540> attached<00:01:30.900> now<00:01:31.170> because<00:01:31.619> I've<00:01:31.740> still

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
still attached now because I've still

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.679 
still attached now because I've still
got<00:01:32.100> some<00:01:32.130> obviously<00:01:32.520> strength<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.299> I'll

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
got some obviously strength to it I'll

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.590 
got some obviously strength to it I'll
cut<00:01:33.990> out<00:01:34.020> these<00:01:34.320> inner<00:01:34.530> circles<00:01:35.299> circles<00:01:36.299> cut

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
cut out these inner circles circles cut

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.770 
cut out these inner circles circles cut
it<00:01:36.720> out<00:01:36.829> all<00:01:37.829> right<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.670> now<00:01:38.790> yep<00:01:39.030> go<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.509> link

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
it out all right so now yep go to link

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.569 
it out all right so now yep go to link
those<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.259> jigsaw<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.829> think<00:01:41.189> those<00:01:41.369> of<00:01:41.520> the

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
those of the jigsaw I think those of the

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.080 
those of the jigsaw I think those of the
jigsaw

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
jigsaw

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.600 
jigsaw
all<00:01:43.570> right<00:01:43.750> and<00:01:43.930> there's<00:01:44.079> our<00:01:44.350> ring<00:01:44.530> just<00:01:45.460> gave

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
all right and there's our ring just gave

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.870 
all right and there's our ring just gave
it<00:01:45.700> a<00:01:45.759> quick<00:01:45.909> sin<00:01:46.240> but<00:01:47.079> that's<00:01:47.290> good<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:48.610> cool

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
it a quick sin but that's good so cool

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.270 
it a quick sin but that's good so cool
trace<00:01:49.810> that<00:01:49.990> out<00:01:50.170> and<00:01:50.350> make<00:01:50.560> another<00:01:50.770> one<00:01:50.920> is

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
trace that out and make another one is

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.090 
trace that out and make another one is
that<00:01:51.460> a<00:01:51.490> rough<00:01:51.670> cut<00:01:51.880> one<00:01:52.060> on<00:01:52.630> the<00:01:52.750> bottom

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
that a rough cut one on the bottom

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.800 
that a rough cut one on the bottom
double-sided<00:01:54.100> tape<00:01:54.399> to<00:01:54.549> that<00:01:54.579> one<00:01:54.820> on<00:01:54.970> now

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
double-sided tape to that one on now

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.840 
double-sided tape to that one on now
let's<00:01:55.990> get<00:01:56.140> the<00:01:56.259> router<00:01:56.470> out<00:01:56.590> and<00:01:57.039> we'll<00:01:57.640> flush

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
let's get the router out and we'll flush

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.560 
let's get the router out and we'll flush
that<00:01:58.320> little<00:01:59.320> cluster<00:01:59.470> get<00:01:59.890> that<00:02:00.520> guy<00:02:00.670> done<00:02:00.909> so

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
that little cluster get that guy done so

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:02.880 
that little cluster get that guy done so
I<00:02:01.600> got<00:02:01.750> two<00:02:01.899> of<00:02:02.020> those<00:02:02.110> now<00:02:02.320> so<00:02:02.500> go<00:02:02.590> to<00:02:02.649> cut<00:02:02.799> the

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
I got two of those now so go to cut the

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.800 
I got two of those now so go to cut the
inside<00:02:03.100> one<00:02:03.280> out<00:02:03.429> but<00:02:03.610> now<00:02:04.149> also<00:02:04.450> give<00:02:04.689> you<00:02:04.780> a

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
inside one out but now also give you a

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.990 
inside one out but now also give you a
rough<00:02:04.990> idea<00:02:05.729> how<00:02:06.729> big<00:02:06.939> it<00:02:07.030> is<00:02:07.149> on<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:09.399> door<00:02:09.610> so

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
rough idea how big it is on the door so

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.520 
rough idea how big it is on the door so
that's<00:02:10.149> both<00:02:10.330> those<00:02:10.599> proper--<00:02:11.019> rings<00:02:11.260> done

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
that's both those proper-- rings done

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.550 
that's both those proper-- rings done
and<00:02:11.769> then<00:02:12.400> these<00:02:12.580> are<00:02:12.640> the<00:02:12.849> rim<00:02:13.810> rings<00:02:14.380> that

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
and then these are the rim rings that

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.559 
and then these are the rim rings that
the<00:02:14.620> woofers<00:02:15.160> have<00:02:15.280> actually<00:02:15.549> mounted<00:02:15.880> on<00:02:16.030> so

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
the woofers have actually mounted on so

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.090 
the woofers have actually mounted on so
what<00:02:16.750> I'm<00:02:16.810> gonna<00:02:16.900> do<00:02:17.049> is<00:02:17.170> router<00:02:17.380> those<00:02:17.680> now

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
what I'm gonna do is router those now

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.009 
what I'm gonna do is router those now
but<00:02:18.730> it'll<00:02:18.970> be<00:02:19.090> about<00:02:19.269> a<00:02:19.330> quarter<00:02:19.750> of<00:02:19.780> an<00:02:19.930> inch

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
but it'll be about a quarter of an inch

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.430 
but it'll be about a quarter of an inch
so<00:02:20.410> pretty<00:02:21.160> much<00:02:21.310> not<00:02:21.790> much<00:02:22.319> different<00:02:23.319> as

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
so pretty much not much different as

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.539 
so pretty much not much different as
they<00:02:23.620> are<00:02:23.680> now<00:02:23.860> they'll<00:02:24.069> just<00:02:24.100> be<00:02:24.280> obviously

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
they are now they'll just be obviously

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:26.880 
they are now they'll just be obviously
be<00:02:24.670> properly<00:02:25.330> rounded<00:02:25.810> so<00:02:26.380> I'm<00:02:26.620> going<00:02:26.739> to<00:02:26.799> go

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
be properly rounded so I'm going to go

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.680 
be properly rounded so I'm going to go
put<00:02:27.040> a<00:02:27.100> bigger<00:02:27.310> bearing<00:02:27.760> on<00:02:27.940> my<00:02:27.970> flush<00:02:28.420> trim

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
put a bigger bearing on my flush trim

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.890 
put a bigger bearing on my flush trim
bit

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
bit

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.020 
bit
there's<00:02:29.140> my<00:02:29.410> quarter<00:02:29.830> inch<00:02:29.860> router<00:02:30.220> bit<00:02:30.489> with

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
there's my quarter inch router bit with

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.630 
there's my quarter inch router bit with
the<00:02:31.330> bearing<00:02:31.750> off<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:32.019> half<00:02:32.200> inch<00:02:32.470> one<00:02:32.709> which

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
the bearing off the half inch one which

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.070 
the bearing off the half inch one which
yeah<00:02:33.849> just<00:02:34.090> worked<00:02:34.269> awesome<00:02:34.480> because<00:02:34.870> I<00:02:34.930> just

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
yeah just worked awesome because I just

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.539 
yeah just worked awesome because I just
did<00:02:35.260> one<00:02:35.410> over<00:02:35.620> here<00:02:36.239> so<00:02:38.010> gives<00:02:39.010> me<00:02:39.130> a<00:02:39.160> quarter

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
did one over here so gives me a quarter

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:41.220 
did one over here so gives me a quarter
of<00:02:39.640> an<00:02:39.730> inch<00:02:39.819> roughly<00:02:40.269> all<00:02:40.390> around<00:02:40.780> pretty

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
of an inch roughly all around pretty

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.380 
of an inch roughly all around pretty
happy<00:02:41.560> of<00:02:41.620> thirds<00:02:41.880> it's<00:02:42.880> taken<00:02:43.180> me<00:02:43.239> two<00:02:43.360> hours

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
happy of thirds it's taken me two hours

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.110 
happy of thirds it's taken me two hours
make<00:02:43.870> them<00:02:44.049> so<00:02:44.980> better<00:02:45.190> be<00:02:45.340> just

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
make them so better be just

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.840 
make them so better be just
constant<00:02:46.720> you<00:02:46.810> know<00:02:46.900> I<00:02:47.230> have<00:02:47.829> to<00:02:47.980> router<00:02:48.579> one

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
constant you know I have to router one

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.640 
constant you know I have to router one
thing<00:02:49.150> take<00:02:49.450> it<00:02:49.510> all<00:02:49.690> apart<00:02:49.900> router<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.410> next

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
thing take it all apart router the next

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.430 
thing take it all apart router the next
thing<00:02:51.269> but<00:02:52.269> anyway<00:02:52.450> they're<00:02:52.630> done<00:02:52.780> now<00:02:52.810> cut

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
thing but anyway they're done now cut

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.110 
thing but anyway they're done now cut
perfect<00:02:53.799> holes<00:02:53.980> get<00:02:54.549> them<00:02:54.640> a<00:02:54.670> little<00:02:54.790> round

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
perfect holes get them a little round

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.319 
perfect holes get them a little round
over<00:02:55.420> on<00:02:55.450> those<00:02:55.690> as<00:02:55.989> well<00:02:57.030> okay<00:02:58.030> so<00:02:58.090> I've<00:02:58.299> got

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
over on those as well okay so I've got

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:01.349 
over on those as well okay so I've got
these<00:02:58.630> it's<00:02:59.260> just<00:02:59.400> thick<00:03:00.400> cardboard<00:03:00.790> all

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
these it's just thick cardboard all

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:03.809 
these it's just thick cardboard all
right<00:03:01.480> pretty<00:03:01.840> strong<00:03:02.140> so<00:03:02.890> that<00:03:02.920> is<00:03:03.400> going<00:03:03.640> to

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
right pretty strong so that is going to

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.270 
right pretty strong so that is going to
wrap<00:03:04.000> I'll<00:03:04.540> do<00:03:04.720> two<00:03:04.870> pieces<00:03:05.049> of<00:03:05.260> time<00:03:05.470> then

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
wrap I'll do two pieces of time then

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.309 
wrap I'll do two pieces of time then
will<00:03:06.430> wrap<00:03:06.579> around<00:03:06.609> it<00:03:07.180> okay<00:03:07.900> I've<00:03:08.049> cut<00:03:08.200> it

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
will wrap around it okay I've cut it

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.890 
will wrap around it okay I've cut it
obviously<00:03:08.590> at<00:03:08.650> 24<00:03:09.040> mil<00:03:09.280> -<00:03:09.489> oh<00:03:09.549> and<00:03:09.730> 12<00:03:10.000> so<00:03:10.750> it's

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
obviously at 24 mil - oh and 12 so it's

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.319 
obviously at 24 mil - oh and 12 so it's
it's<00:03:11.109> the<00:03:11.230> same<00:03:11.410> height<00:03:11.650> then<00:03:11.920> as<00:03:12.130> the<00:03:12.940> inside

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
it's the same height then as the inside

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:14.789 
it's the same height then as the inside
so<00:03:13.630> that's<00:03:13.720> going<00:03:13.959> to<00:03:14.019> wrap<00:03:14.139> around<00:03:14.170> that<00:03:14.590> guy

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
so that's going to wrap around that guy

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.280 
so that's going to wrap around that guy
and<00:03:15.400> staple<00:03:15.819> to<00:03:15.970> it<00:03:16.090> I<00:03:16.239> did<00:03:16.690> end<00:03:16.840> up<00:03:16.930> doing<00:03:17.200> the

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
and staple to it I did end up doing the

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.340 
and staple to it I did end up doing the
double<00:03:17.470> cardboard<00:03:18.120> just<00:03:19.120> two<00:03:19.569> layers<00:03:19.810> it

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
double cardboard just two layers it

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.690 
double cardboard just two layers it
needed<00:03:20.650> to<00:03:20.680> be<00:03:20.829> that<00:03:21.069> little<00:03:21.250> bit<00:03:21.370> thicker

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
needed to be that little bit thicker

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.059 
needed to be that little bit thicker
I<00:03:21.850> just<00:03:22.510> felt<00:03:22.750> if<00:03:23.380> I'm<00:03:23.500> putting<00:03:23.709> pressure<00:03:23.769> on

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
I just felt if I'm putting pressure on

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.129 
I just felt if I'm putting pressure on
I'm<00:03:24.310> stretched<00:03:24.579> in<00:03:24.700> place<00:03:24.880> over<00:03:25.120> but<00:03:26.109> all

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.139 
I'm stretched in place over but all

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:28.740 
I'm stretched in place over but all
right<00:03:26.319> so<00:03:27.190> you<00:03:27.280> get<00:03:27.400> the<00:03:27.519> idea<00:03:27.790> that<00:03:28.030> sits<00:03:28.630> in

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
right so you get the idea that sits in

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.580 
right so you get the idea that sits in
there<00:03:29.040> that<00:03:30.040> gap<00:03:30.870> here's<00:03:31.870> the<00:03:32.139> gap<00:03:32.290> for<00:03:32.500> the

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
there that gap here's the gap for the

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.289 
there that gap here's the gap for the
carpet<00:03:32.920> to<00:03:33.010> tuck<00:03:33.190> into<00:03:33.370> and<00:03:33.790> the<00:03:33.880> gruel<00:03:34.090> is

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
carpet to tuck into and the gruel is

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.240 
carpet to tuck into and the gruel is
pushing<00:03:34.690> hopefully<00:03:35.200> pressure<00:03:35.410> fit<00:03:35.709> you<00:03:36.160> know

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
pushing hopefully pressure fit you know

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.620 
pushing hopefully pressure fit you know
worst<00:03:36.519> case<00:03:36.730> I'll<00:03:36.910> have<00:03:37.030> to<00:03:37.150> screw<00:03:37.329> it<00:03:37.420> on<00:03:37.510> from

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
worst case I'll have to screw it on from

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.720 
worst case I'll have to screw it on from
the<00:03:37.690> back<00:03:37.840> or<00:03:38.019> something<00:03:38.280> but<00:03:39.280> I<00:03:39.310> would<00:03:39.579> say

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
the back or something but I would say

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.420 
the back or something but I would say
it'll<00:03:39.970> pressure<00:03:40.150> fit<00:03:40.590> okay<00:03:41.620> just<00:03:42.040> cut<00:03:42.190> a<00:03:42.220> chunk

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
it'll pressure fit okay just cut a chunk

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.160 
it'll pressure fit okay just cut a chunk
out<00:03:42.609> of<00:03:42.730> the<00:03:42.819> door<00:03:42.970> there<00:03:43.239> that's<00:03:43.660> the<00:03:43.810> carpet

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170

out of the door there that's the carpet
and<00:03:44.410> the<00:03:45.069> crappy<00:03:45.400> foam<00:03:46.000> burning<00:03:46.720> way

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
and the crappy foam burning way

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.660 
and the crappy foam burning way
if<00:03:47.150> it's<00:03:47.420> 30<00:03:47.750> years<00:03:47.900> old<00:03:48.340> so<00:03:49.340> now<00:03:49.459> we're<00:03:49.640> just

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
if it's 30 years old so now we're just

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.640 
if it's 30 years old so now we're just
again<00:03:50.060> I'll<00:03:50.270> get<00:03:50.390> my<00:03:50.510> hair<00:03:50.660> saw<00:03:50.840> and<00:03:51.530> we'll

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
again I'll get my hair saw and we'll

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.350 
again I'll get my hair saw and we'll
just<00:03:51.770> cut<00:03:51.950> that<00:03:52.040> guy<00:03:52.220> out<00:03:52.459> now<00:03:53.090> definitely

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
just cut that guy out now definitely

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.550 
just cut that guy out now definitely
going<00:03:53.630> to<00:03:53.690> cut<00:03:53.840> this<00:03:53.959> one<00:03:54.110> out<00:03:54.170> there's<00:03:54.470> no

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
going to cut this one out there's no

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.110 
going to cut this one out there's no
structural<00:03:55.040> problems<00:03:55.400> if<00:03:55.520> I<00:03:55.610> cut<00:03:55.819> this<00:03:55.940> out

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
structural problems if I cut this out

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.710 
structural problems if I cut this out
this<00:03:57.080> one<00:03:57.260> on<00:03:57.290> the<00:03:57.440> other<00:03:57.590> hand<00:03:57.800> is<00:03:57.920> linking

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
this one on the other hand is linking

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.660 
this one on the other hand is linking
light<00:03:59.720> through<00:04:00.020> there<00:04:00.290> now<00:04:01.010> I<00:04:01.040> know<00:04:01.190> I<00:04:01.340> have<00:04:01.550> to

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
light through there now I know I have to

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.250 
light through there now I know I have to
cut<00:04:01.819> this<00:04:01.940> out<00:04:02.090> but<00:04:02.270> if<00:04:02.300> I<00:04:02.450> cut<00:04:02.630> that<00:04:02.810> out<00:04:02.870> and<00:04:03.020> I

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
cut this out but if I cut that out and I

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.690 
cut this out but if I cut that out and I
can<00:04:03.380> also<00:04:03.530> put<00:04:03.769> it<00:04:03.830> on<00:04:03.890> a<00:04:03.950> slight<00:04:04.220> slant<00:04:04.459> this

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
can also put it on a slight slant this

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.370 
can also put it on a slight slant this
way<00:04:04.849> I<00:04:05.090> might<00:04:05.480> be<00:04:05.630> able<00:04:05.750> to<00:04:05.810> leave<00:04:05.959> that<00:04:05.989> in

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
way I might be able to leave that in

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.949 
way I might be able to leave that in
okay<00:04:07.599> that's<00:04:08.599> it<00:04:08.750> there<00:04:08.989> so<00:04:09.880> shout<00:04:10.880> out<00:04:10.959> handle

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
okay that's it there so shout out handle

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:14.530 
okay that's it there so shout out handle
sits<00:04:12.230> you<00:04:12.950> can<00:04:13.099> see<00:04:13.220> that<00:04:13.370> groove<00:04:13.940> there

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
sits you can see that groove there

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.270 
sits you can see that groove there
well<00:04:15.170> this<00:04:15.319> sits<00:04:15.590> right<00:04:15.800> up<00:04:15.950> against<00:04:16.190> that

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
well this sits right up against that

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.159 
well this sits right up against that
handle<00:04:16.700> it<00:04:16.790> sunk<00:04:17.180> a<00:04:17.269> little<00:04:17.480> kiss<00:04:17.630> the<00:04:17.780> tapers

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
handle it sunk a little kiss the tapers

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.530 
handle it sunk a little kiss the tapers
on<00:04:18.290> it<00:04:18.410> but<00:04:18.590> it<00:04:19.220> sits<00:04:19.489> right<00:04:19.820> on<00:04:19.880> that<00:04:20.180> handle

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
on it but it sits right on that handle

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.560 
on it but it sits right on that handle
straight<00:04:21.500> okay<00:04:22.070> and<00:04:22.700> it<00:04:22.820> goes<00:04:22.940> up<00:04:23.240> there

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
straight okay and it goes up there

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.040 
straight okay and it goes up there
follows<00:04:24.320> that<00:04:24.620> natural<00:04:25.070> line<00:04:25.220> of<00:04:25.250> the<00:04:25.430> door

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
follows that natural line of the door

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.600 
follows that natural line of the door
and<00:04:27.050> now<00:04:27.470> this<00:04:27.710> is<00:04:27.860> the<00:04:27.979> last<00:04:28.190> bit<00:04:28.370> I've<00:04:28.490> just

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
and now this is the last bit I've just

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.760 
and now this is the last bit I've just
got<00:04:28.760> to<00:04:28.850> mark<00:04:29.060> where<00:04:29.270> that<00:04:29.300> dashes<00:04:29.900> so<00:04:30.530> when<00:04:30.680> it

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
got to mark where that dashes so when it

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.250 
got to mark where that dashes so when it
shuts<00:04:30.950> the<00:04:31.040> door<00:04:31.130> so<00:04:31.850> know<00:04:32.060> where<00:04:32.210> to<00:04:32.300> cut<00:04:32.510> just

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
shuts the door so know where to cut just

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.200 
shuts the door so know where to cut just
there<00:04:33.580> otherwise<00:04:34.580> though<00:04:34.940> it's<00:04:35.090> just

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
there otherwise though it's just

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.170 
there otherwise though it's just
following<00:04:35.389> the<00:04:35.660> curve<00:04:35.840> the<00:04:36.260> door<00:04:36.410> obviously

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
following the curve the door obviously

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.060 
following the curve the door obviously
and<00:04:38.180> so<00:04:38.900> the<00:04:38.990> courtesy<00:04:39.470> light<00:04:39.620> will<00:04:39.770> be<00:04:39.860> here

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
and so the courtesy light will be here

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.540 
and so the courtesy light will be here
somewhere

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
somewhere

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.110 
somewhere
and<00:04:41.510> obviously<00:04:41.690> this<00:04:41.960> begins<00:04:42.290> there<00:04:42.850> we<00:04:43.850> right

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
and obviously this begins there we right

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.940 
and obviously this begins there we right
in<00:04:44.300> six<00:04:44.600> seconds<00:04:44.960> later<00:04:45.200> the<00:04:45.440> other<00:04:45.590> one<00:04:45.800> is

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
in six seconds later the other one is

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.060 
in six seconds later the other one is
done<00:04:46.160> because<00:04:46.940> I<00:04:47.060> flipped<00:04:47.570> it<00:04:47.690> so<00:04:48.500> that's<00:04:48.950> the

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
done because I flipped it so that's the

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:50.680 
done because I flipped it so that's the
other<00:04:49.130> door<00:04:49.370> that<00:04:49.729> one<00:04:49.850> because<00:04:50.270> it's<00:04:50.419> clean

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
other door that one because it's clean

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.060 
other door that one because it's clean
on<00:04:50.840> this<00:04:50.960> side<00:04:51.140> you<00:04:51.320> get<00:04:51.440> a<00:04:51.500> better<00:04:51.680> idea<00:04:51.860> I

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
on this side you get a better idea I

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.070 
on this side you get a better idea I
think<00:04:52.220> left<00:04:52.970> that<00:04:53.150> straight<00:04:53.450> edge<00:04:53.479> there<00:04:53.900> and

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
think left that straight edge there and

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.950 
think left that straight edge there and
use<00:04:54.350> the<00:04:54.530> wood<00:04:54.680> for<00:04:54.890> that<00:04:54.919> one<00:04:55.360> all<00:04:56.360> right<00:04:56.510> so

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
use the wood for that one all right so

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.630 
use the wood for that one all right so
I'm<00:04:57.110> going<00:04:57.289> to<00:04:57.350> cut<00:04:57.530> those<00:04:57.710> out<00:04:57.890> now<00:04:57.950> with<00:04:58.550> a

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640 
I'm going to cut those out now with a

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.580 
I'm going to cut those out now with a
jigsaw<00:04:59.020> there<00:05:00.020> we<00:05:00.140> go

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
jigsaw there we go

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.670 
jigsaw there we go
so<00:05:01.220> two<00:05:01.640> of<00:05:01.760> them<00:05:01.910> I've<00:05:02.120> fun<00:05:02.390> I<00:05:02.630> had<00:05:02.840> a<00:05:02.870> the

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
so two of them I've fun I had a the

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.430 
so two of them I've fun I had a the
stapled<00:05:04.430> together<00:05:04.520> mound<00:05:05.240> together<00:05:05.570> a<00:05:05.840> flush

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
stapled together mound together a flush

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.219 
stapled together mound together a flush
trim<00:05:06.620> them<00:05:06.890> then<00:05:07.610> while<00:05:07.789> I<00:05:07.820> nail<00:05:08.180> sanded<00:05:09.140> them

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:09.229 
trim them then while I nail sanded them

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:12.850 
trim them then while I nail sanded them
so<00:05:10.190> they're<00:05:10.490> both<00:05:10.610> identical<00:05:10.880> and<00:05:11.720> also<00:05:12.200> both

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
so they're both identical and also both

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.340 
so they're both identical and also both

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.010 
here's the door and there's two screws
on<00:05:21.260> there<00:05:21.639> so<00:05:22.639> besides<00:05:23.000> a<00:05:23.479> little<00:05:23.630> bit<00:05:23.870> there

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
on there so besides a little bit there

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:25.510 
on there so besides a little bit there
I've<00:05:24.139> got<00:05:24.289> to<00:05:24.380> sand<00:05:24.620> as<00:05:24.830> you<00:05:24.950> can<00:05:25.100> see<00:05:25.280> there

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
I've got to sand as you can see there

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.490 
I've got to sand as you can see there
the<00:05:25.789> gap<00:05:25.970> gets<00:05:26.120> smaller<00:05:26.510> so<00:05:26.960> I've<00:05:27.050> got<00:05:27.200> to<00:05:27.289> send

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
the gap gets smaller so I've got to send

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.250 
the gap gets smaller so I've got to send
that<00:05:27.680> back<00:05:27.830> on<00:05:28.280> both<00:05:28.520> sides<00:05:29.020> besides<00:05:30.020> that

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
that back on both sides besides that

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.340 
that back on both sides besides that
though<00:05:30.490> it<00:05:31.490> all<00:05:31.639> fits<00:05:31.970> and<00:05:32.539> clears<00:05:32.870> and<00:05:33.200> it's

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.350 
though it all fits and clears and it's

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:34.480 
though it all fits and clears and it's
really<00:05:33.740> nice<00:05:33.919> and<00:05:34.100> tight<00:05:34.250> and<00:05:34.430> everything

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
really nice and tight and everything

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.990 
really nice and tight and everything
that's<00:05:34.729> hella<00:05:34.940> good<00:05:35.919> right<00:05:36.919> after<00:05:37.700> much

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
that's hella good right after much

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.920 
that's hella good right after much
thinking<00:05:38.360> I'm<00:05:38.990> doing<00:05:39.530> it<00:05:39.620> flat<00:05:39.889> as<00:05:40.820> in<00:05:41.300> like

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
thinking I'm doing it flat as in like

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.470 
thinking I'm doing it flat as in like
that<00:05:42.139> we're<00:05:42.889> not<00:05:42.979> doing<00:05:43.250> any<00:05:43.400> Reed<00:05:43.639> angle

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:44.480 
that we're not doing any Reed angle

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.390 
that we're not doing any Reed angle
so<00:05:44.810> I'm<00:05:44.930> not<00:05:45.080> tilting<00:05:45.530> it<00:05:45.650> that<00:05:45.980> way<00:05:46.130> and<00:05:46.310> I'm

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
so I'm not tilting it that way and I'm

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.450 
so I'm not tilting it that way and I'm
not<00:05:46.550> tilting<00:05:46.940> that<00:05:47.090> I'm<00:05:47.210> just<00:05:47.360> doing<00:05:47.540> it<00:05:47.600> flat

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.460 
not tilting that I'm just doing it flat

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.620 
not tilting that I'm just doing it flat
just<00:05:49.460> I'm<00:05:49.670> thinking<00:05:49.730> us<00:05:50.150> a<00:05:50.240> look<00:05:50.390> better

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
just I'm thinking us a look better

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.600 
just I'm thinking us a look better
because<00:05:50.960> again<00:05:51.380> the<00:05:51.560> door<00:05:51.740> is<00:05:52.010> dead<00:05:52.340> flat

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
because again the door is dead flat

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.730 
because again the door is dead flat
there's<00:05:52.850> no<00:05:53.120> curve<00:05:53.420> in<00:05:53.600> the<00:05:53.660> door<00:05:53.840> so<00:05:54.410> I<00:05:54.440> may<00:05:54.680> as

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
there's no curve in the door so I may as

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.560 
there's no curve in the door so I may as
well<00:05:54.890> make<00:05:55.040> it<00:05:55.100> dead<00:05:55.460> flat<00:05:55.700> so<00:05:56.240> all<00:05:56.390> I've<00:05:56.540> done

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:56.570 
well make it dead flat so all I've done

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.390 
well make it dead flat so all I've done
at<00:05:56.840> the<00:05:56.900> moment<00:05:56.990> I<00:05:57.200> glued<00:05:57.470> and<00:05:57.740> just<00:05:58.250> put<00:05:58.370> a

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 
at the moment I glued and just put a

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.520 
at the moment I glued and just put a
nail<00:05:58.640> in<00:05:58.670> the<00:05:58.970> little<00:05:59.180> legs<00:05:59.360> I<00:05:59.510> made<00:05:59.690> and<00:06:00.140> then

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:00.530 
nail in the little legs I made and then

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.320 
nail in the little legs I made and then
I<00:06:00.650> just<00:06:00.860> put<00:06:01.040> two<00:06:01.280> tacks<00:06:01.580> in<00:06:01.820> at<00:06:01.940> the<00:06:02.000> moment

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330 
I just put two tacks in at the moment

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.810 
I just put two tacks in at the moment
just<00:06:02.990> to<00:06:03.080> hold<00:06:03.260> that<00:06:03.440> guy<00:06:03.620> so<00:06:04.190> I<00:06:04.220> was<00:06:04.430> happy<00:06:04.700> and

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:04.820

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.000 
just to hold that guy so I was happy and
I<00:06:04.910> am<00:06:05.000> happy<00:06:05.240> with<00:06:05.300> that<00:06:05.450> already<00:06:05.830> and<00:06:06.830> that's

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.010 
I am happy with that already and that's

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:08.320 
I am happy with that already and that's
where<00:06:07.220> the<00:06:07.310> courtesy<00:06:07.700> lights<00:06:07.880> going<00:06:08.030> to<00:06:08.120> go

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:08.330 
where the courtesy lights going to go

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.810 
where the courtesy lights going to go
but<00:06:08.690> it's<00:06:08.810> not<00:06:09.020> on<00:06:09.260> that<00:06:09.590> panel<00:06:09.920> because<00:06:10.640> I'm

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:10.820 
but it's not on that panel because I'm

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.150 
but it's not on that panel because I'm
making<00:06:10.970> other<00:06:11.420> panels<00:06:11.840> and<00:06:12.530> there's<00:06:12.710> both<00:06:13.010> of

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:13.160 
making other panels and there's both of

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.400 
making other panels and there's both of
them<00:06:13.310> done<00:06:14.290> so

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:16.410 
them done so

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:18.530 
them done so
that's<00:06:16.920> how<00:06:17.070> that<00:06:17.220> sits<00:06:17.460> as<00:06:17.640> you<00:06:17.730> can<00:06:17.820> see<00:06:18.030> it's

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:18.540 
that's how that sits as you can see it's

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.010 
that's how that sits as you can see it's
about<00:06:18.720> 1/2<00:06:19.140> centimeters<00:06:19.680> in<00:06:19.970> that<00:06:20.970> side<00:06:21.210> in

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020 
about 1/2 centimeters in that side in

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.950 
about 1/2 centimeters in that side in
the<00:06:22.140> bottom<00:06:22.940> so<00:06:23.940> it's<00:06:24.030> about<00:06:24.180> 1/2<00:06:24.480> centimeters

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 
the bottom so it's about 1/2 centimeters

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.930 
the bottom so it's about 1/2 centimeters
in<00:06:25.080> from<00:06:25.230> the<00:06:25.290> bottom<00:06:25.560> and<00:06:25.770> about<00:06:26.310> 1/2<00:06:26.640> of<00:06:26.850> the

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940 
in from the bottom and about 1/2 of the

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.200 
in from the bottom and about 1/2 of the
side<00:06:27.830> again<00:06:28.830> again<00:06:29.430> it's<00:06:29.580> all<00:06:29.700> going<00:06:30.120> to<00:06:30.150> be

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.210 
side again again it's all going to be

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:31.910 
side again again it's all going to be
fiberglass<00:06:30.750> anyway<00:06:31.200> and<00:06:31.350> on<00:06:31.440> another<00:06:31.710> body

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:31.920 
fiberglass anyway and on another body

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.000 
fiberglass anyway and on another body
filling<00:06:32.370> it<00:06:32.490> but<00:06:32.700> it's<00:06:33.390> you<00:06:33.660> know<00:06:33.690> roughly<00:06:34.110> the

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.010 
filling it but it's you know roughly the

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:36.770 
filling it but it's you know roughly the
lights<00:06:35.190> on<00:06:35.340> the<00:06:35.430> bottom<00:06:35.550> of<00:06:35.880> the<00:06:35.970> door<00:06:36.150> because

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:36.780 
lights on the bottom of the door because

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.120 
lights on the bottom of the door because
that's<00:06:36.990> normally<00:06:37.140> err<00:06:37.380> they<00:06:37.500> are<00:06:37.650> kind<00:06:38.070> of

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.130 
that's normally err they are kind of

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:40.460 
that's normally err they are kind of
towards<00:06:38.550> the<00:06:38.610> bottom<00:06:38.870> okay<00:06:39.870> in<00:06:40.020> one<00:06:40.230> little

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:40.470 
towards the bottom okay in one little

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:42.560 
towards the bottom okay in one little
final<00:06:40.710> touch<00:06:40.980> before<00:06:41.010> the<00:06:41.400> fleece<00:06:41.640> there's<00:06:42.540> a

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:42.570 
final touch before the fleece there's a

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.330 
final touch before the fleece there's a
little<00:06:42.720> skinny<00:06:43.020> bits<00:06:43.260> there<00:06:43.500> I've<00:06:43.950> just<00:06:44.010> hot

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:44.340 
little skinny bits there I've just hot

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.000 
little skinny bits there I've just hot
glue<00:06:44.370> them<00:06:44.760> in<00:06:44.940> there<00:06:45.540> purely<00:06:45.900> just<00:06:46.350> so<00:06:46.500> now

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:47.010 
glue them in there purely just so now

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:49.310 
glue them in there purely just so now
for<00:06:47.070> the<00:06:47.370> shape<00:06:47.610> of<00:06:47.760> the<00:06:47.850> fleece<00:06:48.120> so<00:06:49.050> that<00:06:49.230> the

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:49.320 
for the shape of the fleece so that the

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.740 
for the shape of the fleece so that the
flesh<00:06:49.590> doesn't<00:06:49.980> bow<00:06:50.280> like<00:06:50.610> that<00:06:50.880> I<00:06:51.120> wanted<00:06:51.600> it

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:51.750 
flesh doesn't bow like that I wanted it

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:54.650 
flesh doesn't bow like that I wanted it
to<00:06:51.870> be<00:06:51.990> straight<00:06:52.950> straight<00:06:53.370> so<00:06:54.150> it's<00:06:54.300> all<00:06:54.510> they

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:54.660 
to be straight straight so it's all they

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.330 
to be straight straight so it's all they
are<00:06:54.840> is<00:06:55.110> to<00:06:55.260> give<00:06:55.440> it<00:06:55.530> a<00:06:55.590> straight<00:06:55.860> angle<00:06:56.040> and

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:56.340 
are is to give it a straight angle and

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.270 
are is to give it a straight angle and
saying<00:06:56.760> when<00:06:56.880> it<00:06:56.970> goes<00:06:57.120> down<00:06:57.800> so<00:06:58.800> it's<00:06:59.010> purely

00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.280 
saying when it goes down so it's purely

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.050 
saying when it goes down so it's purely
what<00:06:59.460> they're<00:06:59.610> for

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:00.060 
what they're for

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.760 
what they're for
