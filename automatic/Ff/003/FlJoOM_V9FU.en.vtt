00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.540 
and I'm sure there's a mod that probably
does<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.140> but<00:01:28.290> currently<00:01:28.740> there<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.100> no<00:01:29.250> safe

got some bottles of wine and they're all
dotted<00:02:51.660> around<00:02:51.780> which<00:02:52.620> looks<00:02:52.890> like<00:02:53.040> maybe

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
dotted around which looks like maybe

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.820 
dotted around which looks like maybe
someone<00:02:53.489> was<00:02:53.670> pacing<00:02:54.209> around<00:02:54.330> here<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:54.989> now

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
someone was pacing around here and now

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.590 
someone was pacing around here and now
we've<00:02:55.980> got<00:02:56.100> this<00:02:56.220> lantern<00:02:56.790> which<00:02:57.060> makes<00:02:57.450> me

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
we've got this lantern which makes me

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.650 
we've got this lantern which makes me
think<00:02:57.630> someone's<00:02:58.110> come<00:02:58.260> up<00:02:58.380> here<00:02:58.650> to<00:02:59.660> look

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
think someone's come up here to look

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.960

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
around the tower maybe and we've got a

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.270 
around the tower maybe and we've got a
soul<00:03:03.269> gem<00:03:03.570> which<00:03:03.780> suggests<00:03:04.290> maybe<00:03:04.830> a<00:03:04.950> mage

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
soul gem which suggests maybe a mage

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
because we don't usually find a lot of

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.020 
because we don't usually find a lot of
soul<00:03:07.500> gems<00:03:07.830> and<00:03:07.980> leather<00:03:08.220> dungeons<00:03:08.730> and

there<00:04:26.360> which<00:04:26.690> is<00:04:26.810> like<00:04:26.840> a<00:04:26.990> village<00:04:27.380> and<00:04:28.250> I

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
there which is like a village and I

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.510 
there which is like a village and I
think<00:04:28.820> that<00:04:29.120> Tower<00:04:29.510> is<00:04:29.930> black-winged<00:04:30.890> bluff

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
think that Tower is black-winged bluff

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.390 
think that Tower is black-winged bluff
and<00:04:32.230> I<00:04:33.230> think<00:04:33.440> those<00:04:33.620> the<00:04:33.800> sundered<00:04:34.190> towers

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
and I think those the sundered towers

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.700 
and I think those the sundered towers
over<00:04:34.790> there<00:04:35.000> and<00:04:35.210> there's<00:04:35.960> also<00:04:36.110> forsworn

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
over there and there's also forsworn

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:37.840 
over there and there's also forsworn
over<00:04:36.950> there<00:04:37.070> it's<00:04:37.220> actually<00:04:37.310> part<00:04:37.670> of<00:04:37.730> a

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
over there it's actually part of a

stuff you're
like<00:05:35.449> it<00:05:35.979> but<00:05:36.979> anyway<00:05:37.460> Golda<00:05:37.940> is<00:05:38.150> in<00:05:38.330> fact

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:38.600

buried in reach water rock which lies
under<00:05:41.600> this<00:05:42.110> tower<00:05:42.410> thus<00:05:43.220> why<00:05:43.490> the<00:05:43.550> tower<00:05:43.940> is

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
under this tower thus why the tower is

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.499 
under this tower thus why the tower is
called<00:05:44.600> Golda's<00:05:45.320> tower<00:05:45.590> because<00:05:46.490> Golda<00:05:46.970> most

00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:47.509 
called Golda's tower because Golda most

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:49.540

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.580 
likely used the tower as some kind of a
tree<00:05:49.820> the<00:05:50.360> location<00:05:50.930> was<00:05:51.080> most<00:05:51.320> likely

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:51.590 
tree the location was most likely

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.110 
tree the location was most likely
meaningful<00:05:52.550> to<00:05:52.699> him

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
meaningful to him

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.600 
meaningful to him
and<00:05:53.210> now<00:05:53.570> it<00:05:53.720> marks<00:05:54.080> his<00:05:54.229> grave<00:05:54.320> if<00:05:54.860> we<00:05:55.220> look<00:05:55.430> at
