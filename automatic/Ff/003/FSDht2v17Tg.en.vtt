to turn off what I've done you can see
there's<00:00:18.960> half<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.380> nut<00:00:19.619> I've<00:00:19.890> ground<00:00:20.250> straight

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
there's half a nut I've ground straight

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.859 
there's half a nut I've ground straight
up<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.060> middle<00:00:21.180> of<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.359> bolt<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.840> nut

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
up the middle of the bolt and the nut

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.689 
up the middle of the bolt and the nut
and<00:00:22.199> cut<00:00:22.350> it's<00:00:22.470> dry<00:00:22.680> off<00:00:23.930> right<00:00:24.930> now<00:00:25.580> look<00:00:26.580> at

and cut it's dry off right now look at

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.849 
and cut it's dry off right now look at
the<00:00:26.760> profile<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.539> your<00:00:27.869> normal<00:00:28.170> grinding<00:00:28.650> disk

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
the profile of your normal grinding disk

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.800 
the profile of your normal grinding disk
be<00:00:29.640> honest<00:00:29.910> with<00:00:30.029> you<00:00:30.090> you<00:00:30.210> don't<00:00:30.390> really<00:00:30.539> want

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
be honest with you you don't really want

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.359 
be honest with you you don't really want
to<00:00:30.900> be<00:00:30.960> cutting<00:00:31.230> anything<00:00:31.529> with<00:00:32.130> that

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
to be cutting anything with that

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.000 
to be cutting anything with that
that's<00:00:32.700> all<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:32.880> for<00:00:33.030> grinding<00:00:33.420> but<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:34.010> think

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
that's all I for grinding but I think

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.709 
that's all I for grinding but I think
yeah<00:00:35.100> I<00:00:35.130> was<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.430> go<00:00:35.550> through<00:00:35.579> something<00:00:36.059> okay

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
yeah I was to go through something okay

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.799 
yeah I was to go through something okay
now<00:00:37.350> this<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.739> color<00:00:38.660> profiles<00:00:39.660> different

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
now this is a color profiles different

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.630 
now this is a color profiles different
still<00:00:42.809> quite<00:00:43.590> thick<00:00:43.620> when<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.129> does<00:00:44.309> take<00:00:44.520> the

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
still quite thick when it does take the

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.299 
still quite thick when it does take the
work<00:00:44.820> whereas<00:00:45.390> what<00:00:46.350> I've<00:00:46.469> got<00:00:46.680> is<00:00:46.860> like<00:00:46.890> what

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
work whereas what I've got is like what

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.569 
work whereas what I've got is like what
you<00:00:47.460> think

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
you think

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.340 
you think
where's<00:00:50.579> disc<00:00:50.910> up<00:00:51.090> very<00:00:51.300> quickly<00:00:51.600> but<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.050> cuts

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
where's disc up very quickly but it cuts

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.760 
where's disc up very quickly but it cuts
very<00:00:52.500> quickly<00:00:53.809> time<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.170> essence<00:00:55.559> then

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
very quickly time is of the essence then

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.680 
very quickly time is of the essence then
this<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.579> one<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.910> best<00:00:57.059> ones<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.329> do<00:00:57.510> you

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
this is one of the best ones to do you

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.070 
this is one of the best ones to do you
can<00:00:57.809> also<00:00:57.930> cut<00:00:58.230> aluminium<00:00:58.770> with<00:00:58.890> this<00:00:59.010> disc

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.000 

for<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.110> grinder<00:01:04.589> um<00:01:06.140> won't<00:01:07.140> every<00:01:07.619> grinder

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
for the grinder um won't every grinder

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.789 
for the grinder um won't every grinder
especially<00:01:08.340> you've<00:01:08.430> got<00:01:08.549> an<00:01:08.670> old<00:01:08.850> one

00:01:15.849 --> 00:01:15.859 
because you need have a non-precision

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:19.389 
because you need have a non-precision
whether<00:01:16.859> this<00:01:17.070> fits<00:01:17.520> on<00:01:17.729> here<00:01:18.200> all<00:01:19.200> right

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:19.399 
whether this fits on here all right

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:23.630 
whether this fits on here all right

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
grinding disc in is you fit it on that

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.899 
grinding disc in is you fit it on that
way<00:01:27.569> onto<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.590> spindle<00:01:28.890> on<00:01:29.189> this<00:01:29.460> point<00:01:29.729> you

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
way onto the spindle on this point you

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:43.789 
way onto the spindle on this point you
don't<00:01:30.619> screw<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.679> on<00:01:39.619> flat<00:01:40.619> side<00:01:40.890> down<00:01:42.799> that

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
don't screw it on flat side down that

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.200 
don't screw it on flat side down that
will<00:01:44.159> slice<00:01:44.429> through<00:01:45.799> very<00:01:46.799> quickly

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.399 

I'll<00:01:50.210> put<00:01:50.450> this<00:01:50.539> in<00:01:50.600> the<00:01:50.780> category<00:01:50.990> of<00:01:51.259> a

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
I'll put this in the category of a

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.559 
I'll put this in the category of a
five-star<00:01:52.100> dangerous<00:01:52.520> tool<00:01:52.759> all<00:01:53.090> right

00:01:53.559 --> 00:01:53.569 
five-star dangerous tool all right

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:55.410 
five-star dangerous tool all right
what<00:01:53.960> usually<00:01:54.229> do<00:01:54.350> when<00:01:54.439> you<00:01:54.499> put<00:01:54.679> a<00:01:54.740> disc<00:01:54.920> on

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
what usually do when you put a disc on

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:05.319 
what usually do when you put a disc on
get<00:01:56.420> your<00:01:56.539> goggles<00:01:56.719> on<00:02:03.909> make<00:02:04.909> sure<00:02:04.939> it's<00:02:05.209> not

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
get your goggles on make sure it's not

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:09.279 
get your goggles on make sure it's not
fouling<00:02:07.119> and<00:02:08.119> it's<00:02:08.299> not<00:02:08.509> gonna<00:02:08.629> vibrate<00:02:08.840> off

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
fouling and it's not gonna vibrate off

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.789 
fouling and it's not gonna vibrate off
all<00:02:09.500> right<00:02:09.679> no<00:02:10.429> I<00:02:10.789> usually<00:02:11.360> just<00:02:11.720> unplug<00:02:12.650> it

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:12.799 
all right no I usually just unplug it

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:19.000
