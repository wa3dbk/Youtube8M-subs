00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.170 
it's actually it's actually a vacuum cup
and<00:02:24.100> what<00:02:25.100> this<00:02:25.250> does<00:02:25.490> is<00:02:25.820> you<00:02:26.090> push<00:02:26.780> this<00:02:26.990> guy

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
you know you this is just a cover you

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.370 
you know you this is just a cover you
put<00:02:32.780> you<00:02:33.050> you<00:02:33.440> put<00:02:33.710> this<00:02:33.860> guy<00:02:34.100> down<00:02:34.160> and<00:02:35.380> you

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
put you you put this guy down and you

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:44.890 
put you you put this guy down and you
pump<00:02:37.040> this<00:02:37.250> guy<00:02:37.520> up<00:02:43.210> and<00:02:44.210> it<00:02:44.360> creates<00:02:44.570> a

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
pump this guy up and it creates a

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.390 
pump this guy up and it creates a
tremendous<00:02:45.290> vacuum

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
tremendous vacuum

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.360 
tremendous vacuum
I<00:02:46.430> mean<00:02:47.000> it's<00:02:47.180> so<00:02:47.330> tremendous<00:02:47.900> that<00:02:48.130> it<00:02:49.130> will

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
I mean it's so tremendous that it will

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.570 
I mean it's so tremendous that it will
stand<00:02:50.530> about<00:02:51.530> a<00:02:51.590> hundred<00:02:51.950> pounds<00:02:52.220> of<00:02:52.280> force

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
stand about a hundred pounds of force

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.430 
stand about a hundred pounds of force
okay<00:02:53.450> it's<00:02:53.600> just<00:02:53.750> incredible

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
okay it's just incredible

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.340 
okay it's just incredible
so<00:02:54.950> this<00:02:55.670> is<00:02:55.850> not<00:02:55.970> exactly<00:02:56.480> a<00:02:56.600> smooth<00:02:56.930> surface

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
so this is not exactly a smooth surface

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.800 
so this is not exactly a smooth surface
is<00:02:57.530> slightly<00:02:57.800> textured<00:02:58.250> this<00:02:58.580> table<00:02:58.970> here<00:02:59.180> if

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
is slightly textured this table here if

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.870 
is slightly textured this table here if
we<00:03:00.650> you<00:03:00.800> know<00:03:00.830> when<00:03:01.100> put<00:03:01.340> on<00:03:01.370> a<00:03:01.490> smooth<00:03:01.850> surface

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
we you know when put on a smooth surface

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:08.370 
we you know when put on a smooth surface
like<00:03:02.360> a<00:03:02.510> window<00:03:03.410> or<00:03:03.710> a<00:03:04.180> car<00:03:05.180> hood<00:03:05.420> or

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.540 

motorcycle<00:03:09.380> gas<00:03:09.860> tank

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
motorcycle gas tank

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.850 
motorcycle gas tank
it<00:03:11.450> ain't<00:03:11.780> moving<00:03:12.430> and<00:03:13.630> it<00:03:14.630> okay<00:03:15.290> so<00:03:15.350> I<00:03:15.470> use

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
it ain't moving and it okay so I use

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.720 
it ain't moving and it okay so I use
this<00:03:16.160> okay<00:03:16.910> and<00:03:17.290> I<00:03:18.290> also<00:03:18.530> I<00:03:18.680> also<00:03:19.280> have<00:03:19.580> this

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
this okay and I also I also have this

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.240 
this okay and I also I also have this
little<00:03:20.120> head<00:03:21.020> here<00:03:21.440> which<00:03:22.010> has<00:03:22.220> a

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
little head here which has a

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.640 
little head here which has a
quick-release<00:03:22.610> so<00:03:23.600> all<00:03:23.750> I<00:03:23.780> got<00:03:24.050> to<00:03:24.080> do<00:03:24.290> is<00:03:24.440> just

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
quick-release so all I got to do is just

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.000 
quick-release so all I got to do is just
snap<00:03:24.890> it<00:03:25.070> in<00:03:25.250> and<00:03:25.660> boom<00:03:26.660> it's<00:03:26.960> set<00:03:27.200> snapped<00:03:27.740> in

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
snap it in and boom it's set snapped in

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.160 
snap it in and boom it's set snapped in
it's<00:03:28.580> locked<00:03:28.880> down<00:03:29.120> and<00:03:29.630> I<00:03:30.200> can<00:03:30.380> adjust<00:03:30.710> it<00:03:30.950> and

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
it's locked down and I can adjust it and

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.830 
it's locked down and I can adjust it and
make<00:03:33.580> it<00:03:34.580> do<00:03:34.700> my<00:03:34.880> thing<00:03:35.150> and<00:03:35.360> I<00:03:35.450> recorded

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
make it do my thing and I recorded

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.990 
make it do my thing and I recorded
that's<00:03:36.470> that's<00:03:36.920> how<00:03:37.100> I<00:03:37.130> that's<00:03:37.700> how<00:03:37.820> I<00:03:37.880> did

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
that's that's how I that's how I did

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.370 
that's that's how I that's how I did
many<00:03:38.450> of<00:03:38.660> my<00:03:38.900> early<00:03:39.280> Suzuki<00:03:40.280> sv650<00:03:41.380> videos

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
many of my early Suzuki sv650 videos

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.950 
many of my early Suzuki sv650 videos
with<00:03:42.680> this<00:03:42.830> camera<00:03:43.160> and<00:03:43.480> because<00:03:44.480> like<00:03:44.510> I<00:03:44.900> said

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:44.960 
with this camera and because like I said

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.640 
with this camera and because like I said
it<00:03:45.380> has<00:03:45.560> the<00:03:45.740> 18<00:03:45.770> millimeter<00:03:46.580> lens<00:03:47.260> it<00:03:48.260> makes

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
it has the 18 millimeter lens it makes

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.230 
it has the 18 millimeter lens it makes
things<00:03:49.010> look<00:03:51.340> extremely<00:03:52.340> dynamic<00:03:52.730> when

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:53.240 
things look extremely dynamic when

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.020 
things look extremely dynamic when
moving<00:03:53.510> what<00:03:54.320> I<00:03:54.350> mean<00:03:54.620> by<00:03:54.800> that<00:03:54.830> is<00:03:55.280> you<00:03:55.910> know

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
moving what I mean by that is you know

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.960 
moving what I mean by that is you know
wide-angle<00:03:56.600> lens<00:03:57.400> when<00:03:58.400> you're<00:03:58.550> when<00:03:58.880> the

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
wide-angle lens when you're when the

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.200 
wide-angle lens when you're when the
subject<00:03:59.360> is<00:03:59.450> at<00:03:59.660> a<00:03:59.690> distance<00:04:00.560> away<00:04:00.920> and<00:04:01.400> it

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:02.210 
subject is at a distance away and it

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.740 
subject is at a distance away and it
moves<00:04:02.510> forward<00:04:03.080> the<00:04:03.290> area<00:04:04.750> dramatically

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
moves forward the area dramatically

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
moves forward the area dramatically
increases<00:04:06.470> it<00:04:06.710> increases<00:04:07.070> very<00:04:07.700> quickly<00:04:07.970> so

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
increases it increases very quickly so

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.460 
increases it increases very quickly so
what<00:04:09.770> it<00:04:09.860> looks<00:04:09.890> like<00:04:10.250> is<00:04:10.870> it's<00:04:11.870> traveling<00:04:12.380> at

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
what it looks like is it's traveling at

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.470 
what it looks like is it's traveling at
constant<00:04:12.980> speed<00:04:13.250> but<00:04:14.000> what<00:04:14.330> your<00:04:14.450> eye<00:04:14.480> sees<00:04:14.930> is

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
constant speed but what your eye sees is

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.690 
constant speed but what your eye sees is
something<00:04:17.480> that's<00:04:17.690> nonlinear<00:04:18.500> the<00:04:18.980> area<00:04:19.430> of

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
something that's nonlinear the area of

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.870 
something that's nonlinear the area of
the<00:04:20.299> object<00:04:20.690> is<00:04:20.919> expanding<00:04:21.919> is<00:04:22.070> expanding

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
the object is expanding is expanding

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.660 
the object is expanding is expanding
much<00:04:23.180> faster<00:04:23.720> and<00:04:23.870> it<00:04:24.380> looks<00:04:24.710> like<00:04:25.010> it's<00:04:25.280> going

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:25.670 
much faster and it looks like it's going

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.640 
much faster and it looks like it's going
faster<00:04:26.120> than<00:04:26.150> it<00:04:26.450> really<00:04:26.600> is<00:04:27.010> you<00:04:28.010> know<00:04:28.600> so

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
faster than it really is you know so

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.560 
faster than it really is you know so
that's<00:04:30.650> the<00:04:30.920> deal<00:04:31.160> if<00:04:31.430> you<00:04:31.730> if<00:04:32.030> you<00:04:32.300> want

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
that's the deal if you if you want

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.220 
that's the deal if you if you want
something<00:04:32.990> to<00:04:33.140> look<00:04:33.880> dynamic<00:04:34.880> then<00:04:35.720> you<00:04:35.960> want

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230 
something to look dynamic then you want

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.370 
something to look dynamic then you want
if<00:04:36.920> you<00:04:37.160> want<00:04:37.370> it<00:04:37.490> to<00:04:37.580> look<00:04:37.700> fast<00:04:38.150> then<00:04:39.020> you<00:04:39.230> get

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
if you want it to look fast then you get

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.950 
if you want it to look fast then you get
something<00:04:39.770> wide<00:04:40.100> a<00:04:40.400> wide-angle<00:04:40.790> lens<00:04:41.180> is<00:04:41.600> key

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
something wide a wide-angle lens is key

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.170 
something wide a wide-angle lens is key
to<00:04:42.830> to<00:04:43.310> getting<00:04:43.670> to<00:04:44.000> getting<00:04:44.500> to<00:04:45.500> getting<00:04:45.860> that

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
to to getting to getting to getting that

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.300 
to to getting to getting to getting that
to<00:04:47.180> getting<00:04:47.450> those<00:04:47.570> shots<00:04:47.630> the<00:04:48.560> disadvantage

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
to getting those shots the disadvantage

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.300 
to getting those shots the disadvantage
is<00:04:49.460> when<00:04:50.090> you're<00:04:50.210> not<00:04:50.390> very<00:04:50.690> far<00:04:51.020> away<00:04:51.310> objects

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
is when you're not very far away objects

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.340 
is when you're not very far away objects
appear<00:04:52.700> really<00:04:53.420> really<00:04:53.720> tiny<00:04:53.930> look<00:04:54.140> at<00:04:54.230> how

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
appear really really tiny look at how

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.740 
appear really really tiny look at how
tiny<00:04:54.620> my<00:04:54.770> hand<00:04:55.190> is<00:04:55.460> you<00:04:56.120> look<00:04:56.270> how<00:04:56.390> tiny<00:04:56.630> that

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
tiny my hand is you look how tiny that

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.960 
tiny my hand is you look how tiny that
watches<00:04:57.380> but<00:04:57.890> when<00:04:58.040> you<00:04:58.130> look<00:04:58.310> it<00:04:58.430> up<00:04:58.460> when<00:04:58.880> you

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
watches but when you look it up when you

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.460 
watches but when you look it up when you
look<00:04:59.150> up<00:04:59.270> real<00:04:59.510> close<00:04:59.660> it's<00:04:59.990> like<00:05:00.020> oh<00:05:00.260> my

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
look up real close it's like oh my

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.720 
look up real close it's like oh my
goodness<00:05:00.740> it's<00:05:01.130> so<00:05:01.220> big<00:05:02.140> okay<00:05:03.400> that's<00:05:04.400> how<00:05:04.610> it

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
goodness it's so big okay that's how it

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.280 
goodness it's so big okay that's how it
works<00:05:04.940> that's<00:05:05.180> how<00:05:05.270> the<00:05:05.390> wide-angle<00:05:05.750> lens

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
works that's how the wide-angle lens

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:13.980 
works that's how the wide-angle lens
works<00:05:06.670> so<00:05:10.570> so<00:05:11.570> basically<00:05:11.750> I<00:05:12.670> pretty<00:05:13.670> much

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
works so so basically I pretty much

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.930 
works so so basically I pretty much
decommissioned<00:05:14.990> I<00:05:15.490> haven't<00:05:16.490> used<00:05:16.730> this

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:16.940 
decommissioned I haven't used this

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.230 
decommissioned I haven't used this
camera<00:05:17.270> as<00:05:17.800> much<00:05:18.800> as<00:05:18.980> I've<00:05:19.310> used<00:05:19.670> a<00:05:19.820> kodak

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
camera as much as I've used a kodak

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.790 
camera as much as I've used a kodak
because<00:05:20.660> I'm<00:05:20.840> just<00:05:21.020> having<00:05:21.380> too<00:05:21.560> much<00:05:21.740> fun

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
because I'm just having too much fun

backseat and what I've done is

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:41.920 
backseat and what I've done is
I<00:06:39.560> didn't<00:06:40.190> employ<00:06:40.550> the<00:06:40.759> suction<00:06:41.120> cup<00:06:41.330> but

I didn't employ the suction cup but

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.409 
I didn't employ the suction cup but
because<00:06:42.380> it<00:06:42.530> had<00:06:42.680> such<00:06:42.919> a<00:06:42.949> wide<00:06:43.280> base<00:06:43.580> what<00:06:44.389> I

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:44.419 
because it had such a wide base what I

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:47.590 
because it had such a wide base what I
did<00:06:44.720> was<00:06:44.930> I<00:06:45.110> put<00:06:45.350> Bunji<00:06:46.130> Bunji<00:06:46.370> straps<00:06:47.180> around

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:47.600

that<00:06:50.990> it<00:06:51.139> pointed<00:06:51.500> it<00:06:51.770> would<00:06:51.919> point<00:06:52.160> backwards

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:52.460 
that it pointed it would point backwards

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.850 
that it pointed it would point backwards
