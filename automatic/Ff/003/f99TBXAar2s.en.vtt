00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.319
 in our segment notions of equestrian 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.580
 one of the most important requirements 

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:07.830
 for a race thoroughbred 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.639
 it is the permission of the practices of 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.809
 chair 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.130
 the equestrian team in moments had 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.620
 one morning behind the splitter 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.620
 automatic let's see what happened 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.910
 one of the main requirements for 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.650
 the official participation or the debut of 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.780
 a sample of careers are the 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.390
 teaching practices 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.820
 a qualified personnel belonging to the 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.640
 body of grooms work from 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.080
 early in the automatic splitter 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.910
 let's know a little more of what 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:42.490
 happens one morning with the departure of the 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.490
 sunlight behind the cat 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.650
 how 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.120
 There are opportunities in which 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.280
 horses behave somewhat unruly and 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.290
 the grooms go into action with 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.570
 some tricks and some implements 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.550
 needed to dominate these huge 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.140
 Exemplary weighing approximately to 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.140
 950 pounds or more 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.670
 here work and we consist in 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.760
 teach the enclaves by one when 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.450
 it's going to hit us 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.310
 sometimes they come here to teach them to 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.560
 break well enter well and do not disturb 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.690
 when they go to the race we 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.690
 we work here from 6 to 9 in the morning 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.790
 the important while low that I 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.610
 I grab when they get here to the chair and 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.820
 came in with it and I keep it 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.530
 there to place I can go straight and 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.450
 can give their good departure but when 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.120
 change come the web program I give 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.160
 turn back 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.060
 good today to teach them that locals have 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.790
 what to enter 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.000
 and also a very risky job 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.880
 because we are teaching on horseback that 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.210
 they are like starting to work for the 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.210
 others 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.390
 well my name is javier carriÃ³n is a 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.879
 panama ethics team I already have 5 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.670
 years I was collaborating I'm like to 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:26.079
 learn in the morning I dedicate myself to depart 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.209
 here as a horse to brake or 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:30.640
 professional since I have enough 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.400
 experience about this I currently have 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.750
 a policeman in the hand who are used to 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.269
 when the keys are too re 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.819
 green are too rebellious this is 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.349
 This applies applies the come is 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.349
 they put their ear down their hair they love 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:46.750
 he asks for a bit of this second if he goes 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.940
 he hurt himself to learn a rider and the 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.829
 pretty cds with this is for faces it 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.989
 They use horses when they are very 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:54.790
 scared that they do not want to enter matches 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.769
 pieces are afraid or something is going to happen 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.810
 he covers his face was blindfolds 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.879
 so that he loses fear from the 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.159
 moment he blindfolds no longer sees 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:05.440
 is helpless then to learn or 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:07.569
 you can put it in and go easy when 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.139
 he enters he takes off the face cover of a 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.349
 time 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:14.310
 that village that nothing has happened to it 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.310
 is the operation of this 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.489
 the catches are practiced in 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.349
 mostly by horses that are 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.420
 debut or debut or for a 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:30.980
 copy with problems at the time of 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.980
 leave at an official event 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.299
 we are the match right now 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.670
 automatic with an electrical device all 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.140
 I worked electromechanically this is 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.579
 this works in this way then 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.890
 active I already have all his 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:48.700
 working there is up active while 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.610
 barely active the doors close and 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.740
 what is here 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.320
 it closes here and I'm going to the 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.000
 war here is the image of a magnet 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.730
 that is here and you can observe the 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.170
 Imam this that has stuck this that has 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.550
 stuck once 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:07.800
 to the door you can use manual 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.110
 press with current also with him with 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.930
 the cable what the web split 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.910
 decide but always in the race you use 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.620
 with the cable because he has the 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:20.120
 visibility from far to observe 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.120
 the horses as they are inside 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:35.620
 the practices of catteries are without a doubt 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.200
 some a vitally important detail 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.760
 for a racing horse and every morning 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.010
 a good movement of 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.500
 specimens that are prepared for their 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:47.050
 future races a horse with a bad 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.060
 starting in an official race has to 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.650
 make a double effort to recover 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.870
 that inconvenience that take advantage of 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:57.330
 other rivals and sometimes up 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.330
 it costs the victory to any copy
