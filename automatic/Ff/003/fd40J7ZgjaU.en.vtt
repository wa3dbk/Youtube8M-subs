00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.229 
gears using these paddle shifters the
only<00:03:13.380> problem<00:03:13.650> is<00:03:13.769> it<00:03:14.220> adds<00:03:14.400> weight<00:03:14.880> to<00:03:14.940> the

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
only problem is it adds weight to the

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
performance slightly and so you're

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.840
