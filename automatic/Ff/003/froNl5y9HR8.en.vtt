changing the tree and the Machine at the

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
same time so over six years we've gone

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.090 
same time so over six years we've gone
from<00:00:55.140> very<00:00:55.770> large<00:00:56.730> machines<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.930> trees<00:00:58.379> to

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
from very large machines and trees to

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.369 
from very large machines and trees to

smaller and more compact trees and to

smaller and more compact trees and to
small<00:01:01.710> machines<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:02.670> we<00:01:02.850> have<00:01:03.030> we've<00:01:03.390> have<00:01:03.539> two

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
small machines so we have we've have two

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.329 
small machines so we have we've have two
harrassing<00:01:04.229> technologies<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:05.159> we<00:01:05.309> have

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
harrassing technologies that we have

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.359 
harrassing technologies that we have
examined<00:01:05.880> one<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.210> trunk<00:01:06.510> shaking<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.369> trunk

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
examined one is trunk shaking and trunk

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.460 
examined one is trunk shaking and trunk
shaking<00:01:08.790> transmits<00:01:09.360> shake<00:01:09.659> very<00:01:10.110> well

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
shaking transmits shake very well

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.710 
shaking transmits shake very well
vertically<00:01:11.070> less<00:01:11.670> well<00:01:11.909> horizontally<00:01:12.630> and

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
vertically less well horizontally and

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.080 
vertically less well horizontally and
very<00:01:12.990> poorly<00:01:13.380> down<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.220> out<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.520> branch<00:01:14.760> like

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
very poorly down and out of branch like

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.780 
very poorly down and out of branch like
this<00:01:15.439> so<00:01:16.439> what<00:01:16.860> we've<00:01:17.009> had<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.310> do<00:01:17.460> for<00:01:17.700> those

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
this so what we've had to do for those

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.210 
this so what we've had to do for those
trees<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.509> try<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:18.900> prove<00:01:19.140> those<00:01:19.619> machines<00:01:20.070> is

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
trees is try and prove those machines is

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.800 
trees is try and prove those machines is
pruning<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.610> trees<00:01:20.850> into<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.150> very<00:01:21.390> short

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
much of a fruiting wall as we can so we

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.730 
much of a fruiting wall as we can so we
want<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.880> short<00:01:39.150> tree<00:01:39.450> no<00:01:39.810> more<00:01:39.990> than<00:01:40.170> 10<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.500> 12

what<00:01:53.510> we're<00:01:53.690> really<00:01:53.840> hoping<00:01:54.110> is<00:01:54.470> that

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
what we're really hoping is that

what we're really hoping is that
mechanical<00:01:55.130> harvesting<00:01:55.580> will<00:01:55.760> be<00:01:55.880> cheaper<00:01:56.300> be

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
mechanical harvesting will be cheaper be

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.840 
mechanical harvesting will be cheaper be
more<00:01:57.050> reliable<00:01:57.440> than<00:01:57.830> trying<00:01:58.100> to<00:01:58.310> find<00:01:58.580> an
