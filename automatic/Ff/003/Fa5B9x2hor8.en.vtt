00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.130
 Hallöchen yes I wanted you again 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.460
 caution 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.200
 because from tomorrow you have it 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.780
 maybe already seen in before 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.220
 my channel image or above 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:20.010
 with a channel banner yes that stands 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:23.039
 gamestar fifa wm oracle and uruguay and 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:27.060
 also the flag of uruguay for me 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.189
 take part with my channel yes to the wm 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.840
 oracle which of gamestar and peter 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.950
 rented into the world 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:38.010
 a total of 32 youtubers are present and the 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.960
 quasi play the results before so 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.219
 the first results are already 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.559
 on road 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.149
 I'll be back with the whole thing 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.379
 a landing page that could be in the 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.660
 see video description 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.579
 then you have all participants and 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.250
 the players were also the players 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:57.270
 come out uruguay is coming now 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:00.930
 Monday at 17 o'clock if I'm right 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.609
 get out the first game against costa rica there 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.170
 of course you have to thumb your thumbs 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.420
 to press 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.369
 and then after that the games against 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.500
 england and italy the coming 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.830
 of course, and accordingly 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.320
 whole works so independent 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.290
 from the actual results one man 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.380
 has then played after that 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.210
 otherwise it would be eighth-finals 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.060
 it's not an oracle if you say it now 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.460
 would 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.049
 uruguay and italy are now coming 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.600
 next but in real com england and 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:33.909
 Costa rica then you could then 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.500
 after that, do nothing more about it 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.420
 Although it is based on the 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.700
 group play so first of all 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.770
 group games made after that it goes 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.289
 but then continue with the right wm 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.360
 So if Italy and England continue 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.159
 have come where we hope, of course 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.810
 that at least uruguay first or 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:55.079
 second will be the pairing in the second 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.450
 eighth-final quarter-final semi-final 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:01.119
 then orakelt regardless of the 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.100
 result what you had at fifa 14 now 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.929
 but that always depends 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.240
 the results in real wm 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:11.230
 so that the oracle is up to the 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:13.900
 I can continue tomorrow 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.310
 then turn or I have that 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.739
 already played i know like that 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.810
 result is the game now against 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.700
 Italy is still at this time 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.930
 open this is the last group game there 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.400
 I'm really very excited and 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.459
 Of course I would be glad if you 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.470
 then the videos are very happy 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.299
 also with the game partners or halt 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.170
 every day just take a look 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:39.670
 the gamestar site that is linked times 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.630
 you can also take a look at it 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.750
 times with the other channels 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.670
 drop by and yes would be nice if you 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.769
 because you will definitely be there 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.650
 Interesting games were interesting 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:53.410
 here and yes only to the preselections 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.760
 tomorrow it starts then or on monday 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.260
 Now I do not know when not that 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.280
 video uploaded exactly because now 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.810
 it is currently sunday half past ten and yes 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.389
 have fun in any case 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.190
 so uruguay and you too 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:08.380
 germany anyway but also uruguay 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.269
 the thumbs press that this is possible 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.090
 to the semi-finals or even finals 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:15.040
 create because the team has it 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.500
 really in itself so you really have to 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.750
 say these are not amateurs 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.060
 even if it's the name when you get it from 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.359
 name maybe first thinks there 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:30.060
 are really good players and indeed 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:33.549
 not too short of all there we have 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.920
 there is a defense there for example the 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:37.470
 diego godín 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.319
 is here or one 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.450
 another player is still at atletico 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.250
 madrid in defense and diego godín has 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.400
 namely in the champions league finale 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.180
 this year against madrid but 4 1 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.700
 was lost 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.680
 but at least the 1 0 made for madrid 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.319
 So shot for Atletico Madrid 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.050
 then we have more in the 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:00.840
 Storm is then really around the 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:04.230
 scorer from england at the fc 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.690
 liverpool luis suárez is once in the 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.010
 storm will play with me too 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.700
 you can imagine that way 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:15.750
 in the storm are suarez and cavani cavani 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:18.870
 is the partner of storm at ibrahimovic 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.090
 Paris-Germain and he is there too 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.100
 a goalgetter so that's right 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.020
 horny storm and then there are still 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.330
 the diego forlan is now on 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.070
 Settlers at the club level such a 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.690
 bit submerged he plays in fact 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.550
 Japan for whatever reason 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.400
 he is already a bit in 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.260
 the years have come but good he is always 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.380
 still good and he is also doing the leave 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.150
 By the way, then right then temporarily 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.130
 So now play in the first two 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.440
 I played him substitute against 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.850
 it will definitely be from Italy 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.470
 start playing on the 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.229
 right wing because he has really good 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.539
 flank it and cavani and suarez for 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:55.979
 right head monster and that too 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:57.990
 Mittelfeld is not that bad 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:00.900
 is not as good as the storm is there 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:03.630
 really three world class players but the 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.370
 Team is really one of those 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.080
 you can give her a small favorit role 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.180
 may not admit it now 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:13.680
 blatant as now perhaps in spain 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:16.440
 germany italy brazil but so 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.240
 should be eightfinal or quarterfinal 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.620
 Be there in any case and with luck 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.000
 maybe even a semifinal so 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.400
 Maybe you see a lot here 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.840
 player also from me because of the oracle 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:29.729
 So thumb push hard 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.810
 and yes tomorrow at 17 clock I just watch 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:35.430
 just not yet time to do something? 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:37.410
 Wrong tell exactly tomorrow at 17 o'clock 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.870
 is then the first game I then 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.550
 on my channel not only show up 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.800
 my channel but also on the channel 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.870
 from the player because I was together 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.790
 in ts with him so the game is quasi 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:52.030
 while playing live from both 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:55.300
 comments really funny and afterwards 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.590
 then on june 14th at 6 pm i can do that 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.020
 now also say that is the 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:01.390
 Saturday is the second game 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:04.810
 against england and the game against 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:07.770
 Italy, that's what it is 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:11.980
 Of course that is on 19 june 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:14.200
 and there at 16 o'clock but that you will learn 

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:16.570
 then live on my channel and me 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.100
 say thank you for listening to me 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:20.980
 Really happy if you will 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.730
 look inside and push hard 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:24.270
 take care of it 

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.270
 See you
