they<00:00:38.579> got<00:00:38.790> tossed<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:39.450> now<00:00:39.570> we're<00:00:39.690> going<00:00:39.780> to

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
they got tossed so now we're going to

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.280 
they got tossed so now we're going to
show<00:00:40.050> you<00:00:40.110> today<00:00:40.530> how<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:41.700> use<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.059> dioxide<00:00:42.750> line

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
not the most expensive light but most

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.190 
not the most expensive light but most
people<00:00:48.210> probably<00:00:48.300> would<00:00:48.539> throw<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.809> away<00:00:48.899> not

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
people probably would throw it away not

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.680 
people probably would throw it away not
think<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.590> it's<00:00:50.399> any<00:00:50.610> good<00:00:50.640> anymore<00:00:50.940> we're

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
think it it's any good anymore we're

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.200 
think it it's any good anymore we're
going<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.870> prove<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.199> wrong<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:53.399> from<00:00:54.120> a

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
going to prove that wrong so from a

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.910 
going to prove that wrong so from a
deoxys<00:00:54.570> emergency<00:00:55.050> kit<00:00:55.230> which<00:00:55.379> holds<00:00:55.710> all

different types of applications we have

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.619 
different types of applications we have
a<00:00:59.370> couple<00:00:59.550> products<00:01:00.000> here<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.300> can<00:01:00.449> work

a couple products here that can work
very<00:01:00.660> well<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.320> clean<00:01:01.530> us<00:01:01.649> up<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.520> simplest<00:01:02.910> is

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
very well to clean us up the simplest is

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.429 
very well to clean us up the simplest is
the<00:01:03.300> opposite<00:01:03.600> dn5<00:01:04.339> crack<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.519> open<00:01:06.439> and

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
the opposite dn5 crack it open and

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.810 
the opposite dn5 crack it open and
there's<00:01:07.590> lots<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.860> other<00:01:07.950> applications<00:01:08.670> that

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
there's lots of other applications that

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.460 
there's lots of other applications that
you<00:01:08.880> can<00:01:09.060> use<00:01:09.210> for<00:01:09.240> even<00:01:09.689> finer<00:01:09.990> in<00:01:10.170> fact<00:01:10.350> we

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
you can use for even finer in fact we

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.469 
you can use for even finer in fact we
might<00:01:10.619> even<00:01:10.770> use<00:01:10.860> some<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.880> swabs<00:01:12.240> that

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
might even use some of the swabs that

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.880 
might even use some of the swabs that
are<00:01:12.570> available<00:01:12.930> in<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.049> emergency<00:01:13.350> kit<00:01:13.710> as

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
are available in the emergency kit as

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.570 
are available in the emergency kit as
well<00:01:14.549> as<00:01:14.970> some<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:16.040> wipes<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.250> are<00:01:17.430> also

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
well as some of the wipes that are also

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.010 
well as some of the wipes that are also
available<00:01:17.820> actually<00:01:18.420> might<00:01:18.540> be<00:01:18.630> good<00:01:18.780> for<00:01:18.960> the

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
available actually might be good for the

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.420 
available actually might be good for the
body<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.409> this<00:01:19.530> but<00:01:19.740> look<00:01:19.890> at<00:01:19.950> this<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.100> try<00:01:20.369> for

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
body of this but look at this a try for

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.749 
body of this but look at this a try for
now<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.420> see<00:01:21.600> how<00:01:21.900> this<00:01:22.110> goes<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.759> removing

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
now and see how this goes and removing

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.370 
now and see how this goes and removing
all<00:01:23.909> this<00:01:24.150> oxidation<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:25.049> we<00:01:25.110> can<00:01:25.229> put

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
all this oxidation so that we can put

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.710 
all this oxidation so that we can put
new<00:01:25.500> batteries<00:01:25.710> in<00:01:25.950> here<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:27.060> have<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.509> good

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
new batteries in here and have a good

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.800 
new batteries in here and have a good
time<00:01:27.869> with<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.110> now<00:01:28.409> what<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.619> deoxidizer

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
time with it now what the deoxidizer

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.530 
time with it now what the deoxidizer
corrosion<00:01:30.810> that's<00:01:31.500> inside<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:31.950> here

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
corrosion that's inside of here

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.609 
corrosion that's inside of here
especially<00:01:33.540> in<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:33.930> body<00:01:34.140> here<00:01:34.439> but

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
especially in the body here but

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.580

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:48.020 
longer use out of the products as well
so<00:01:46.829> we're<00:01:46.950> going<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.159> put<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.460> spray<00:01:47.670> this<00:01:47.820> all

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
so we're going to put and spray this all

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.249 
so we're going to put and spray this all
down<00:01:48.290> and<00:01:49.290> we'll<00:01:49.439> probably<00:01:49.649> take<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.950> little

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
down and we'll probably take a little

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.370 
down and we'll probably take a little
foam<00:01:52.259> pad<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.920> remove<00:01:53.280> most<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.850> this<00:01:54.380> just

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
foam pad and remove most of this just

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.290 
foam pad and remove most of this just
because<00:01:55.530> there's<00:01:55.680> some<00:01:55.829> excess<00:01:56.310> in<00:01:56.520> here

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.570 

and<00:01:59.720> that<00:01:59.990> comes<00:02:00.170> in<00:02:00.380> the<00:02:00.470> siq<00:02:00.620> it<00:02:00.830> also<00:02:01.310> so<00:02:01.490> we

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
and that comes in the siq it also so we

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.520 
and that comes in the siq it also so we
can<00:02:01.700> kind<00:02:01.790> of<00:02:01.880> remove<00:02:02.120> some<00:02:02.330> of<00:02:02.360> these<00:02:02.540> the

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
can kind of remove some of these the

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.470 
can kind of remove some of these the
excess<00:02:03.860> it's<00:02:04.040> in<00:02:04.190> here<00:02:04.460> but<00:02:05.120> we're<00:02:05.240> not<00:02:05.360> going

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:05.480 
excess it's in here but we're not going

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.910 
excess it's in here but we're not going
to<00:02:05.540> be<00:02:05.600> done<00:02:05.780> quite<00:02:06.050> yet<00:02:06.080> because<00:02:06.500> we<00:02:06.710> want<00:02:06.860> to

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
to be done quite yet because we want to

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.320 
to be done quite yet because we want to
keep<00:02:07.100> this<00:02:07.280> protected<00:02:07.850> so<00:02:07.970> it<00:02:08.030> doesn't<00:02:08.240> happen

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
keep this protected so it doesn't happen

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.180

we're pretty cleaned up in here it got a
lot<00:03:02.660> of<00:03:02.690> corrosion<00:03:03.080> out<00:03:03.430> and<00:03:04.430> that<00:03:04.760> will<00:03:04.880> take

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
lot of corrosion out and that will take

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.229 
lot of corrosion out and that will take
some<00:03:05.090> of<00:03:05.390> the<00:03:05.450> shield<00:03:05.780> and<00:03:06.310> just<00:03:07.310> simply<00:03:07.820> apply

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
it to the contacts themselves because

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.949 
it to the contacts themselves because
that<00:03:11.959> will<00:03:12.080> protect<00:03:12.260> them<00:03:12.590> from<00:03:12.770> future

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
that will protect them from future

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.620 
that will protect them from future
contamination<00:03:15.760> and<00:03:16.760> the<00:03:17.030> other<00:03:17.150> important

thing<00:03:17.660> to<00:03:17.840> remember<00:03:17.989> also<00:03:18.620> this<00:03:18.890> is<00:03:19.010> a<00:03:19.040> plastic

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
thing to remember also this is a plastic

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.240 
thing to remember also this is a plastic
body<00:03:19.880> case<00:03:20.390> none<00:03:21.290> of<00:03:21.380> the<00:03:21.530> oxide<00:03:21.890> products

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
body case none of the oxide products

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.449 
body case none of the oxide products
will<00:03:23.120> damage<00:03:23.720> any<00:03:23.930> plastic<00:03:24.560> so<00:03:24.800> you're<00:03:24.980> safe

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
will damage any plastic so you're safe

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.210 
will damage any plastic so you're safe
to<00:03:25.640> use<00:03:25.670> those<00:03:26.500> so<00:03:27.500> now<00:03:27.650> we're<00:03:27.800> trying<00:03:27.980> to<00:03:28.070> put

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
wipe on this one contact that's still

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.310 
wipe on this one contact that's still
showing<00:03:33.739> a<00:03:33.860> little<00:03:33.950> bit<00:03:34.130> of<00:03:34.190> corrosion<00:03:35.320> comes

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
showing a little bit of corrosion comes

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.360

now<00:03:51.230> before<00:03:51.560> we<00:03:51.650> do<00:03:51.799> that<00:03:51.830> we<00:03:52.310> can<00:03:53.060> actually

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
now before we do that we can actually

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.470 
now before we do that we can actually
apply<00:03:54.250> some<00:03:55.250> dioxin<00:03:55.700> to<00:03:55.790> the<00:03:55.879> batteries<00:03:56.299> to

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
apply some dioxin to the batteries to

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.059 
apply some dioxin to the batteries to
give<00:03:56.629> it<00:03:56.810> give<00:03:57.260> the<00:03:57.409> life<00:03:57.890> of<00:03:58.040> the<00:03:58.129> batteries<00:03:58.459> a

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
give it give the life of the batteries a

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.059 
give it give the life of the batteries a
more<00:04:01.069> use<00:04:01.370> than<00:04:01.549> without<00:04:01.730> you'll<00:04:02.599> see<00:04:02.810> that<00:04:03.069> it

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
more use than without you'll see that it

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:05.890 
more use than without you'll see that it
will<00:04:04.190> actually<00:04:04.340> incremental<00:04:04.700> change<00:04:05.239> the

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
will actually incremental change the

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.780 
will actually incremental change the
life<00:04:06.079> of<00:04:06.230> the<00:04:06.290> battery<00:04:06.489> give<00:04:07.489> it<00:04:07.610> a<00:04:07.640> better

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
life of the battery give it a better

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.330 
life of the battery give it a better
charge<00:04:08.180> and<00:04:08.709> simply<00:04:09.709> just<00:04:09.860> putting<00:04:10.099> it<00:04:10.190> right

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
charge and simply just putting it right

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:16.719 
charge and simply just putting it right
on<00:04:10.519> where<00:04:10.849> the<00:04:10.940> contacts<00:04:11.390> are<00:04:15.549> and<00:04:16.549> you<00:04:16.609> almost

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
on where the contacts are and you almost

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:21.580 
on where the contacts are and you almost
can't<00:04:17.060> overdo<00:04:17.449> it<00:04:18.070> whoops<00:04:19.959> let's<00:04:20.959> put<00:04:21.229> that<00:04:21.410> in

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
can't overdo it whoops let's put that in

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.300 
can't overdo it whoops let's put that in
there<00:04:22.810> plus<00:04:23.810> more<00:04:24.320> and<00:04:24.650> plus<00:04:24.860> if<00:04:24.979> i'll<00:04:25.070> keep<00:04:25.190> it

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
there plus more and plus if i'll keep it

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.909 
there plus more and plus if i'll keep it
protected<00:04:25.490> also<00:04:26.180> so<00:04:26.240> it's<00:04:26.479> kind<00:04:26.660> of<00:04:26.690> gotta<00:04:26.919> get

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
protected also so it's kind of gotta get

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.400 
protected also so it's kind of gotta get
twice<00:04:28.520> the<00:04:28.580> method<00:04:29.240> of<00:04:29.330> protection<00:04:30.199> for

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
twice the method of protection for

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.800 
twice the method of protection for
future<00:04:31.310> contamination<00:04:32.120> again<00:04:32.419> this<00:04:32.570> light

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
future contamination again this light

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.390 
future contamination again this light
stays<00:04:33.050> outside<00:04:33.500> so<00:04:33.770> it's<00:04:33.889> going<00:04:33.979> to<00:04:34.070> get<00:04:34.190> wet

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
stays outside so it's going to get wet

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.430 
stays outside so it's going to get wet
it's<00:04:34.669> designed<00:04:34.910> for<00:04:35.330> that<00:04:35.449> but<00:04:36.289> obviously

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
it's designed for that but obviously

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.000 
it's designed for that but obviously
after<00:04:36.919> so<00:04:37.789> much<00:04:37.940> time<00:04:38.000> being<00:04:38.389> out<00:04:38.630> here<00:04:39.010> took

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
after so much time being out here took

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.350 
after so much time being out here took
on<00:04:40.130> a<00:04:40.160> lot<00:04:40.280> of<00:04:40.340> water<00:04:40.580> and<00:04:40.880> the<00:04:41.120> corrosion

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
on a lot of water and the corrosion

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.420 
on a lot of water and the corrosion
really<00:04:41.720> built<00:04:41.960> up<00:04:43.450> so<00:04:44.450> that's<00:04:44.599> on<00:04:44.870> there<00:04:45.080> good

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
really built up so that's on there good

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.250 
really built up so that's on there good
and<00:04:46.430> then<00:04:47.120> the<00:04:47.240> big<00:04:47.450> test<00:04:47.780> is<00:04:47.990> whether<00:04:48.139> or<00:04:48.200> not

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
and then the big test is whether or not

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.240 
and then the big test is whether or not
this<00:04:48.500> works<00:04:49.120> but<00:04:50.120> we're<00:04:50.300> very<00:04:51.130> confident<00:04:52.130> that

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
this works but we're very confident that

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:58.330 
this works but we're very confident that
it<00:04:52.460> will<00:04:52.960> keep<00:04:53.960> this<00:04:54.139> in<00:04:54.349> there

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:05.860 

now<00:04:59.420> that<00:05:00.420> off<00:05:00.570> we'll<00:05:00.900> come<00:05:01.050> back<00:05:01.230> to<00:05:01.380> that<00:05:04.280> and

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
now that off we'll come back to that and

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.600 
now that off we'll come back to that and
our<00:05:06.870> life<00:05:07.050> is<00:05:07.260> back<00:05:07.440> on<00:05:07.500> and<00:05:07.890> functioning<00:05:08.370> I

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
our life is back on and functioning I

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.600 
our life is back on and functioning I
think<00:05:09.300> I'll<00:05:09.390> be<00:05:09.480> barbecuing<00:05:09.900> again<00:05:10.140> today

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
think I'll be barbecuing again today

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.070 
think I'll be barbecuing again today
