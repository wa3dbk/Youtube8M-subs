has to be a better way to be able to
charge<00:00:18.670> up<00:00:18.820> these<00:00:18.970> devices<00:00:19.360> so<00:00:20.140> we<00:00:20.230> thought<00:00:20.380> up

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:20.529 
charge up these devices so we thought up

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:22.290 
charge up these devices so we thought up
to<00:00:20.680> solar<00:00:20.890> backpack<00:00:21.099> and<00:00:21.580> actually<00:00:21.939> built<00:00:22.150> it

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:22.300 
to solar backpack and actually built it

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.960 
to solar backpack and actually built it
as<00:00:22.390> an<00:00:23.050> experiment<00:00:23.349> and<00:00:23.789> turned<00:00:24.789> out<00:00:24.850> this

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970 
as an experiment and turned out this

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.210 
as an experiment and turned out this
experiment<00:00:25.539> turned<00:00:25.720> into<00:00:25.930> a<00:00:25.990> company<00:00:26.350> that

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
experiment turned into a company that

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.040 
experiment turned into a company that
now<00:00:27.340> charges<00:00:27.760> everyone's<00:00:28.180> handheld<00:00:28.720> devices

hour of talk time because your computer

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.450 
hour of talk time because your computer
laptop<00:00:41.380> needs<00:00:41.500> a<00:00:41.620> lot<00:00:41.739> more<00:00:41.770> power<00:00:42.100> than<00:00:42.399> a

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
laptop needs a lot more power than a

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.760 
laptop needs a lot more power than a
salt<00:00:42.790> than<00:00:43.059> a<00:00:43.090> cell<00:00:43.360> phone<00:00:43.540> so<00:00:44.110> the<00:00:44.260> panel<00:00:44.710> is

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:44.770 
salt than a cell phone so the panel is

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.560 
salt than a cell phone so the panel is
much<00:00:44.920> bigger<00:00:45.130> the<00:00:45.640> battery's<00:00:46.090> a<00:00:46.120> little<00:00:46.450> bit

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
much bigger the battery's a little bit

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.810 
much bigger the battery's a little bit
bigger<00:00:46.750> as<00:00:46.930> well<00:00:47.140> and<00:00:47.379> so<00:00:47.829> that<00:00:47.860> this<00:00:48.190> this<00:00:48.640> guy

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
bigger as well and so that this this guy

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.020 
bigger as well and so that this this guy
will<00:00:49.890> obviously<00:00:50.890> hold<00:00:51.280> in<00:00:51.399> your<00:00:51.430> laptop<00:00:51.850> and

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
will obviously hold in your laptop and

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.209 
will obviously hold in your laptop and
charge<00:00:52.360> up<00:00:52.510> your<00:00:52.539> laptop<00:00:53.039> wherever<00:00:54.039> you<00:00:54.129> are

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:54.219 
charge up your laptop wherever you are

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:55.770 
charge up your laptop wherever you are
with<00:00:54.640> the<00:00:54.760> bag<00:00:54.879> you<00:00:55.000> get<00:00:55.120> the<00:00:55.239> battery<00:00:55.570> and

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
with the bag you get the battery and

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.110 
with the bag you get the battery and
then<00:00:56.379> you<00:00:56.890> get<00:00:57.039> a<00:00:57.100> standard<00:00:57.489> set<00:00:57.640> of<00:00:57.670> adapter

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
then you get a standard set of adapter

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.889 
then you get a standard set of adapter
so<00:00:58.420> this<00:00:59.050> is<00:00:59.230> a<00:00:59.260> USB<00:01:00.039> adapter<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:01.629> then<00:01:01.750> we

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
so this is a USB adapter and then we

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:03.840 
so this is a USB adapter and then we
have<00:01:02.020> a<00:01:02.050> set<00:01:02.260> of<00:01:02.350> standard<00:01:02.739> phone<00:01:03.160> adapter<00:01:03.610> so

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
have a set of standard phone adapter so

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.700 
have a set of standard phone adapter so
most<00:01:04.300> common<00:01:04.690> phones<00:01:04.930> will<00:01:05.199> be<00:01:05.289> one<00:01:05.440> of<00:01:05.560> these

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
most common phones will be one of these

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.010 
most common phones will be one of these
the<00:01:06.190> fabric<00:01:06.490> can<00:01:06.700> get<00:01:06.820> wet<00:01:07.000> the<00:01:07.450> panel's<00:01:07.840> can

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
the fabric can get wet the panel's can

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.740 
the fabric can get wet the panel's can
get<00:01:08.170> wet<00:01:08.380> so<00:01:08.710> these<00:01:09.280> are<00:01:09.340> all<00:01:09.520> if<00:01:09.940> they<00:01:10.479> get<00:01:10.600> wet

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
get wet so these are all if they get wet

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.630 
get wet so these are all if they get wet
they<00:01:10.899> just<00:01:11.110> dry<00:01:11.289> out<00:01:11.500> and<00:01:11.680> they're<00:01:11.799> fine<00:01:12.040> but

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
they just dry out and they're fine but

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.590 
they just dry out and they're fine but
one<00:01:12.790> thing<00:01:12.939> that<00:01:12.970> you<00:01:13.150> do<00:01:13.240> have<00:01:13.299> to<00:01:13.420> worry

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
one thing that you do have to worry

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.000 
one thing that you do have to worry
about<00:01:13.689> a<00:01:13.780> little<00:01:14.049> bit<00:01:14.170> is<00:01:14.290> the<00:01:14.409> battery<00:01:14.710> so<00:01:14.920> the

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
about a little bit is the battery so the

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.429 
about a little bit is the battery so the
battery<00:01:15.340> inside<00:01:16.119> just<00:01:16.330> like<00:01:16.390> any<00:01:16.600> battery<00:01:17.020> you

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:17.439 
battery inside just like any battery you

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:18.660 
battery inside just like any battery you
wouldn't<00:01:17.710> get<00:01:17.799> your<00:01:17.920> cell<00:01:18.070> phone<00:01:18.220> battery<00:01:18.549> wet

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
wouldn't get your cell phone battery wet

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.429 
wouldn't get your cell phone battery wet
you<00:01:18.850> wouldn't<00:01:19.090> get<00:01:19.180> this<00:01:19.299> battery<00:01:19.600> went<00:01:19.840> over

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:20.439 
you wouldn't get this battery went over

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:21.960 
you wouldn't get this battery went over
this<00:01:20.530> last<00:01:20.590> Christmas<00:01:21.100> season<00:01:21.369> a<00:01:21.460> lot<00:01:21.580> of<00:01:21.760> kids

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.820 
this last Christmas season a lot of kids

I think Gotham has christmas gift and
what<00:01:24.700> I've<00:01:24.820> noticed<00:01:25.060> is<00:01:25.360> that<00:01:25.450> kids<00:01:26.110> instantly

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
what I've noticed is that kids instantly

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:27.929 
what I've noticed is that kids instantly
get<00:01:26.680> it<00:01:26.830> you<00:01:26.979> know<00:01:27.070> when<00:01:27.159> I<00:01:27.189> walk<00:01:27.430> into<00:01:27.610> some

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 
get it you know when I walk into some

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:30.450 
get it you know when I walk into some
place<00:01:28.119> and<00:01:28.570> someone<00:01:29.350> who<00:01:29.560> you<00:01:29.799> know<00:01:29.860> below<00:01:30.130> 18

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
place and someone who you know below 18

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.160 
place and someone who you know below 18
sees<00:01:30.729> it<00:01:30.909> they<00:01:31.210> instantly<00:01:31.540> understand<00:01:32.049> that

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
sees it they instantly understand that

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.990 
sees it they instantly understand that
discharges<00:01:32.590> their<00:01:33.369> cell<00:01:33.580> phones<00:01:33.790> because

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
discharges their cell phones because

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.160 
discharges their cell phones because
this<00:01:34.210> is<00:01:34.360> something<00:01:34.479> that<00:01:34.600> they<00:01:34.780> kind<00:01:34.960> of<00:01:35.020> need
