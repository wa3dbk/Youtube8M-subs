on the party like I said with touch
screen<00:02:17.510> responsiveness<00:02:18.220> compared<00:02:19.220> to<00:02:19.310> the

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
screen responsiveness compared to the

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.910 
screen responsiveness compared to the
iphone<00:02:19.520> not<00:02:19.970> good<00:02:20.240> alone<00:02:21.050> as<00:02:21.350> its<00:02:21.740> own

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
iphone not good alone as its own

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.730 
iphone not good alone as its own
touchscreen<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:23.450> QWERTY<00:02:24.140> was<00:02:24.320> really<00:02:24.560> good

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
touchscreen the QWERTY was really good

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.200 
touchscreen the QWERTY was really good
and<00:02:24.950> it<00:02:25.130> was<00:02:25.160> really<00:02:25.340> responsive<00:02:25.940> the<00:02:26.060> only

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
and it was really responsive the only

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.240 
and it was really responsive the only
thing<00:02:26.360> I<00:02:26.420> didn't<00:02:26.750> like<00:02:26.780> was<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:27.620> fact<00:02:27.890> the

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
thing I didn't like was the fact the

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.370 
thing I didn't like was the fact the
spacebar<00:02:28.880> was<00:02:29.090> really<00:02:29.480> tiny<00:02:29.720> and<00:02:29.870> sometimes<00:02:30.260> I

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
spacebar was really tiny and sometimes I

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.300 
spacebar was really tiny and sometimes I
was<00:02:30.470> into<00:02:30.680> ?<00:02:31.100> and<00:02:31.430> doing<00:02:31.670> it<00:02:33.310> accelerometer

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
was into ? and doing it accelerometer

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.310 
was into ? and doing it accelerometer
see<00:02:35.090> now<00:02:35.210> that's<00:02:35.330> something<00:02:35.690> I<00:02:35.750> liked<00:02:35.960> also

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
see now that's something I liked also

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.130 
see now that's something I liked also

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
because with the view you actually had

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.260

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.560 
it normally is like 15 or 20 and I got
it<00:05:18.960> tin<00:05:19.410> which<00:05:19.920> was<00:05:20.160> good<00:05:20.760> price<00:05:20.970> I<00:05:21.180> jumped<00:05:21.480> on

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
it tin which was good price I jumped on

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:22.700 
it tin which was good price I jumped on
that<00:05:21.600> and<00:05:21.810> a<00:05:21.840> heartbeat<00:05:22.110> once<00:05:22.290> the<00:05:22.380> guy<00:05:22.470> said

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
that and a heartbeat once the guy said

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:28.040 
that and a heartbeat once the guy said
it<00:05:25.040> the<00:05:26.040> edge<00:05:26.190> speed<00:05:26.610> is<00:05:26.820> actually<00:05:27.480> moderately

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
it the edge speed is actually moderately

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.080 
it the edge speed is actually moderately
fast<00:05:28.350> you<00:05:29.310> wouldn't<00:05:29.580> think<00:05:29.669> the<00:05:29.820> edge<00:05:29.940> would

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
fast you wouldn't think the edge would

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.470 
fast you wouldn't think the edge would
be<00:05:30.210> fast<00:05:30.480> whatsoever<00:05:31.490> because<00:05:32.490> 3<00:05:33.090> g's<00:05:33.300> the

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:33.480 
be fast whatsoever because 3 g's the

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.930 
be fast whatsoever because 3 g's the
fastest<00:05:33.930> you<00:05:34.140> know<00:05:34.260> and<00:05:34.530> at<00:05:34.860> my<00:05:35.460> house<00:05:35.640> all<00:05:35.910> i

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
fastest you know and at my house all i

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.210 
fastest you know and at my house all i
get<00:05:36.060> is<00:05:36.180> edge<00:05:36.390> only<00:05:36.930> when<00:05:37.320> i'm<00:05:37.410> in<00:05:37.500> tulsa<00:05:37.890> can<00:05:38.100> i

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
get is edge only when i'm in tulsa can i

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.380 
get is edge only when i'm in tulsa can i
get<00:05:38.430> 3g<00:05:39.530> well<00:05:40.530> edge<00:05:40.860> was<00:05:41.760> pretty<00:05:41.970> darn<00:05:42.150> fast

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.390 
get 3g well edge was pretty darn fast

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.810 
get 3g well edge was pretty darn fast
for<00:05:42.750> that<00:05:42.930> I<00:05:43.140> mean<00:05:43.350> it<00:05:43.440> was<00:05:43.530> kind<00:05:43.770> of<00:05:43.830> honestly

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
for that I mean it was kind of honestly

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.790 
for that I mean it was kind of honestly
I<00:05:45.000> think<00:05:45.210> the<00:05:45.480> edge<00:05:45.630> on<00:05:45.990> the<00:05:46.140> Eternity<00:05:46.620> was<00:05:46.770> a

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
I think the edge on the Eternity was a

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.170 
I think the edge on the Eternity was a
little<00:05:47.100> faster<00:05:47.580> than<00:05:47.610> the<00:05:47.820> edge<00:05:47.970> on<00:05:48.330> the<00:05:49.200> 3g

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
little faster than the edge on the 3g

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.930 
little faster than the edge on the 3g
but<00:05:51.180> well<00:05:52.169> not<00:05:52.260> on<00:05:52.440> the<00:05:52.560> 3g<00:05:52.800> but<00:05:53.100> on<00:05:53.280> the<00:05:53.460> iphone

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
but well not on the 3g but on the iphone

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.150 
but well not on the 3g but on the iphone
3g<00:05:54.330> but<00:05:55.200> i<00:05:55.260> think<00:05:55.500> that's<00:05:55.650> just<00:05:55.740> because<00:05:55.919> the

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 
3g but i think that's just because the

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.460 
3g but i think that's just because the
iphone<00:05:56.430> 3g<00:05:56.880> pulls<00:05:57.330> up<00:05:57.510> full<00:05:57.720> websites<00:05:58.140> and

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.470 
iphone 3g pulls up full websites and

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:03.830 
iphone 3g pulls up full websites and
this<00:05:58.950> so-called<00:06:00.200> HTML<00:06:01.200> browser<00:06:02.419> didn't<00:06:03.419> so<00:06:03.750> it

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 
this so-called HTML browser didn't so it

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.090 
this so-called HTML browser didn't so it
was<00:06:03.960> a<00:06:03.990> little<00:06:04.140> faster<00:06:04.590> with<00:06:04.680> that<00:06:04.830> i<00:06:04.860> was

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.100 
was a little faster with that i was

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.220 
was a little faster with that i was
pulling<00:06:05.280> up<00:06:05.430> mobile<00:06:05.730> sites<00:06:05.940> and<00:06:06.240> small<00:06:06.810> java

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:07.230 
pulling up mobile sites and small java

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:12.950 
pulling up mobile sites and small java

stuff you know the build quality it was

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.500

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:19.370 
sturdy the battery backing on it felt
like<00:06:18.090> it<00:06:18.270> was<00:06:18.360> a<00:06:18.390> brushed<00:06:18.630> metal<00:06:18.780> but<00:06:19.020> wasn't

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380 
like it was a brushed metal but wasn't

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.590 
like it was a brushed metal but wasn't
it<00:06:19.470> was<00:06:19.590> actually<00:06:19.860> plastic<00:06:20.280> but<00:06:21.120> the<00:06:21.390> weight

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.120 
except for a little more square not as

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.590 
except for a little more square not as

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 
rounded the location of the latke was

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.870 
rounded the location of the latke was
just<00:06:46.350> like<00:06:46.470> the<00:06:46.620> iphone<00:06:46.740> bring<00:06:47.640> out<00:06:47.760> the

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:47.880 
just like the iphone bring out the

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.460 
just like the iphone bring out the
iphone<00:06:47.970> you've<00:06:48.480> got<00:06:48.660> the<00:06:48.780> lock<00:06:48.960> key<00:06:49.200> right

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:49.470 
iphone you've got the lock key right

here<00:06:50.090> that's<00:06:51.090> exactly<00:06:51.780> where<00:06:52.110> the<00:06:52.590> log<00:06:52.740> key

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:53.010 
here that's exactly where the log key

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.310 
here that's exactly where the log key
was<00:06:53.250> on<00:06:53.550> the<00:06:53.610> eternity<00:06:54.120> so<00:06:54.630> I<00:06:54.660> was<00:06:54.840> used<00:06:54.870> to<00:06:55.140> it
