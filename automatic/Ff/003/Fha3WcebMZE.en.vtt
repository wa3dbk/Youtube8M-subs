everyone its Brad here with neuen and
today<00:00:06.600> we're<00:00:06.720> gonna<00:00:06.779> take<00:00:06.990> a<00:00:07.020> look<00:00:07.319> at<00:00:07.560> using<00:00:07.859> a

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
today we're gonna take a look at using a

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.060 
today we're gonna take a look at using a
mouse<00:00:08.460> with<00:00:09.120> your<00:00:09.330> phone<00:00:09.690> which<00:00:10.620> is<00:00:10.650> kind<00:00:10.920> of<00:00:10.980> a

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
mouse with your phone which is kind of a

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.049 
mouse with your phone which is kind of a
crazy<00:00:11.309> idea<00:00:11.519> but<00:00:11.820> because<00:00:12.300> Windows<00:00:12.750> 10<00:00:13.170> mobile

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:14.059 
crazy idea but because Windows 10 mobile

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:16.730 
crazy idea but because Windows 10 mobile
uses<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.210> core<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.480> Windows<00:00:15.839> 10<00:00:16.020> it<00:00:16.440> actually

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
uses the core of Windows 10 it actually

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.230 
uses the core of Windows 10 it actually
supports<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.190> feature<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.580> also<00:00:17.789> supports<00:00:18.150> a

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
supports the feature and also supports a

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.760 
supports the feature and also supports a
keyboard<00:00:18.630> as<00:00:18.690> well<00:00:18.840> but<00:00:19.199> that's<00:00:19.380> not<00:00:19.529> nearly

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
keyboard as well but that's not nearly

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.010 
keyboard as well but that's not nearly
as<00:00:19.949> much<00:00:20.070> fun<00:00:20.130> so<00:00:21.029> what<00:00:21.390> I've<00:00:21.510> done<00:00:21.630> here<00:00:21.840> is

I've<00:00:32.340> done<00:00:32.460> here<00:00:32.520> is<00:00:32.880> I've<00:00:33.329> paired<00:00:33.719> with<00:00:33.870> the

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
I've done here is I've paired with the

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.389 
I've done here is I've paired with the
phone<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.649> as<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.340> can<00:00:35.489> see<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:36.149> mouse<00:00:36.360> works

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
phone and as you can see the mouse works

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:39.380 
phone and as you can see the mouse works
and<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.489> works<00:00:38.640> just<00:00:38.790> like<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:38.969> mouse

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
and it works just like a mouse

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.740 
and it works just like a mouse
left-click<00:00:40.700> initiates<00:00:41.700> actions<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.480> can

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
left-click initiates actions and you can

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:43.700 
left-click initiates actions and you can
see<00:00:42.870> here<00:00:43.050> we<00:00:43.140> launched<00:00:43.320> Spartan

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
see here we launched Spartan

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.040 
see here we launched Spartan
unfortunately<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.610> scroll<00:00:45.360> wheel<00:00:45.510> does<00:00:45.870> not

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
unfortunately the scroll wheel does not

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.459 
unfortunately the scroll wheel does not
work<00:00:46.350> very<00:00:46.620> well<00:00:47.129> or<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:47.640> should<00:00:48.030> say<00:00:48.149> at<00:00:48.270> all

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
work very well or I should say at all

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:50.750 
work very well or I should say at all
right<00:00:49.469> mouse<00:00:49.620> click<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.890> not<00:00:50.190> detected<00:00:50.610> either

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
right mouse click is not detected either

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.529 
right mouse click is not detected either
but<00:00:51.360> left<00:00:51.899> click<00:00:52.110> works<00:00:52.530> just<00:00:53.039> fine<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.850> mean

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
but left click works just fine I mean

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.000 
but left click works just fine I mean
this<00:00:54.629> is<00:00:54.750> kind<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:55.079> it's<00:00:55.320> more<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.829> novelty

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
this is kind of it's more of a novelty

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.350 
this is kind of it's more of a novelty
at<00:00:56.370> this<00:00:56.520> point<00:00:56.760> because<00:00:56.940> there's<00:00:57.030> no<00:00:57.210> real

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
at this point because there's no real

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.729 
at this point because there's no real
reason<00:00:57.719> why<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:57.870> should<00:00:58.109> be<00:00:58.230> using<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.559> mouse

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
reason why you should be using a mouse

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.950 
reason why you should be using a mouse
with<00:00:58.949> your<00:00:59.070> phone<00:00:59.280> but<00:01:00.120> if<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.629> want<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.870> use

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
with your phone but if you want to use

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.590 
with your phone but if you want to use
it<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.530> does<00:01:01.739> work<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:03.090> should<00:01:03.270> work<00:01:03.300> with

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
it it does work and it should work with

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.020 
it it does work and it should work with
any<00:01:03.660> Bluetooth<00:01:04.049> mouse<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:05.309> pairs<00:01:05.580> just<00:01:05.909> like

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
any Bluetooth mouse it pairs just like

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.420 
any Bluetooth mouse it pairs just like
anything<00:01:06.450> else<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:07.049> even<00:01:07.530> works<00:01:07.799> up<00:01:08.010> in<00:01:08.130> here

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
anything else and even works up in here

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.030 
anything else and even works up in here
and<00:01:08.580> then<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.909> vacations<00:01:09.360> area<00:01:09.860> go<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.920> the

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
bluetooth and you can see here it is the

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.039 
bluetooth and you can see here it is the
designer<00:01:20.729> mouse<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.210> connected<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.750> didn't

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
designer mouse and is connected I didn't

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.170 
designer mouse and is connected I didn't
try<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.229> at<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.409> arc<00:01:22.560> touch<00:01:22.799> Mouse<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:24.000> did

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
try it at the arc touch Mouse and it did

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.539 
try it at the arc touch Mouse and it did
work<00:01:24.360> as<00:01:24.540> well<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:24.930> any<00:01:25.680> type<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.040> mouse<00:01:26.280> should

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
work as well so any type of mouse should

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.840 
work as well so any type of mouse should
work<00:01:26.900> and<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.680> only<00:01:28.740> thing<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.369> really<00:01:29.490> can't

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
work and the only thing you really can't

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.440 
work and the only thing you really can't
do<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.060> there's<00:01:30.270> no<00:01:30.479> way<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.320> go<00:01:31.829> back<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:33.270> your

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
do is there's no way to go back so your

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.660 
do is there's no way to go back so your
let's<00:01:34.380> see<00:01:34.500> you're<00:01:34.650> forced<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.070> actually<00:01:35.400> use

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
let's see you're forced to actually use

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.920 
let's see you're forced to actually use
the<00:01:35.820> physical<00:01:36.150> keys<00:01:36.299> which<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.600> on<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.750> big

surprise<00:01:37.140> because<00:01:37.409> I<00:01:37.530> don't<00:01:37.680> think<00:01:37.710> Microsoft

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
surprise because I don't think Microsoft

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.469 
surprise because I don't think Microsoft
really<00:01:38.340> expects<00:01:38.729> too<00:01:38.850> many<00:01:39.030> people<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.390> be
