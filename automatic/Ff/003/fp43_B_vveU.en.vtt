00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
of hope who used this skill when before

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.099 
of hope who used this skill when before
it<00:03:25.560> was<00:03:25.680> a<00:03:25.919> skill<00:03:26.220> for<00:03:26.430> me<00:03:26.579> in<00:03:26.699> my<00:03:26.849> life

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:27.109 
it was a skill for me in my life

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:29.629

reaching out from that place if that

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:32.599 
reaching out from that place if that
makes<00:03:29.849> any<00:03:30.000> sense<00:03:30.150> at<00:03:30.540> all<00:03:30.629> and<00:03:31.190> you<00:03:32.190> know<00:03:32.220> I
