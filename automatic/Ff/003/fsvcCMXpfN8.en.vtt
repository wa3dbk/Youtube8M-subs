00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.390 
looks like it looks like a disaster
waiting<00:04:23.340> to<00:04:23.580> happen<00:04:24.050> that<00:04:25.050> is<00:04:25.229> so<00:04:25.500> full<00:04:25.890> that<00:04:25.950> I

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
waiting to happen that is so full that I

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.690 
waiting to happen that is so full that I
know<00:04:26.460> that<00:04:27.090> it's<00:04:27.240> gonna<00:04:27.390> boil<00:04:27.690> over<00:04:28.550> what<00:04:29.550> you

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
know that it's gonna boil over what you

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.430 
know that it's gonna boil over what you
said<00:04:30.000> because<00:04:30.330> these<00:04:30.720> bars<00:04:31.050> are

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
said because these bars are

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.360 
said because these bars are
they<00:04:32.130> taste<00:04:32.430> so<00:04:32.580> good<00:04:32.940> I<00:04:33.860> didn't<00:04:34.860> make<00:04:34.980> it<00:04:35.040> in

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
they taste so good I didn't make it in

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.330 
they taste so good I didn't make it in
at<00:04:35.790> this<00:04:36.030> kind<00:04:36.570> of<00:04:36.630> 10<00:04:36.960> last<00:04:37.290> year<00:04:37.860> and<00:04:38.100> I'm<00:04:38.310> a

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
at this kind of 10 last year and I'm a

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.570 
at this kind of 10 last year and I'm a
feeling<00:04:38.970> that<00:04:39.980> maybe<00:04:40.980> that's<00:04:41.190> not<00:04:41.400> the<00:04:41.460> right

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
feeling that maybe that's not the right

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.450 
feeling that maybe that's not the right
size<00:04:41.880> team<00:04:42.210> I<00:04:42.510> don't<00:04:43.350> know<00:04:43.620> but<00:04:43.860> we'll<00:04:44.040> see

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
size team I don't know but we'll see

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.690 
size team I don't know but we'll see
what<00:04:44.670> happens<00:04:44.970> and<00:04:45.780> we'll<00:04:46.170> put<00:04:46.380> this<00:04:46.530> in<00:04:46.770> a<00:04:46.860> 350

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
what happens and we'll put this in a 350

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.370 
what happens and we'll put this in a 350
degree<00:04:47.730> oven<00:04:48.480> again<00:04:49.140> for<00:04:49.560> 30<00:04:49.860> to<00:04:50.160> 35<00:04:50.730> minutes

until the topping sets so I'll put it on
30<00:04:57.180> minutes<00:04:57.780> and<00:04:57.960> then<00:04:58.020> I'll<00:04:58.380> check<00:04:58.770> it<00:04:59.010> and

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
30 minutes and then I'll check it and

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.010 
30 minutes and then I'll check it and
we'll<00:04:59.280> see<00:04:59.520> what<00:04:59.700> it<00:04:59.730> looks<00:04:59.970> like<00:05:00.180> i'll<00:05:00.960> be

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
we'll see what it looks like i'll be

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.480 
we'll see what it looks like i'll be
back<00:05:01.500> back<00:05:03.020> all<00:05:04.020> right<00:05:04.380> here's<00:05:04.950> what<00:05:05.160> it<00:05:05.280> looks

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
back back all right here's what it looks

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:13.180 
back back all right here's what it looks
like<00:05:05.760> I<00:05:07.670> almost<00:05:10.340> boiled<00:05:11.340> over<00:05:11.730> right<00:05:12.540> there

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
like I almost boiled over right there

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.950 
like I almost boiled over right there
but<00:05:14.190> for<00:05:14.430> some<00:05:14.700> reason<00:05:15.270> it<00:05:15.300> did<00:05:15.990> not<00:05:16.230> kick<00:05:16.820> even

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
but for some reason it did not kick even

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.260 
but for some reason it did not kick even
one<00:05:18.960> side<00:05:19.350> is<00:05:19.830> higher<00:05:20.220> than<00:05:20.430> the<00:05:20.610> other<00:05:20.790> so

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
one side is higher than the other so

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.650 
one side is higher than the other so
this<00:05:21.450> size<00:05:21.750> a<00:05:21.780> little<00:05:22.050> bit<00:05:22.260> more<00:05:22.410> done<00:05:23.600> so<00:05:24.600> i

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
this size a little bit more done so i

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.000 
this size a little bit more done so i
had<00:05:24.870> to<00:05:24.990> keep<00:05:25.140> it<00:05:25.320> in<00:05:25.440> there<00:05:25.590> a<00:05:25.620> little<00:05:25.830> bit

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
had to keep it in there a little bit

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.570 
had to keep it in there a little bit
longer<00:05:26.250> than<00:05:26.580> what<00:05:26.760> i<00:05:26.790> wanted<00:05:27.300> to<00:05:28.430> but<00:05:29.430> what
