00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:12.070
 you can not deny the fact that marvel 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.530
 studios is the king of the movies of 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.660
 Superheroes have tried their universe 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.430
 cinematic they can practically 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.900
 take almost any concept of your 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:25.330
 comics and adapt it to the big screen 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.279
 almost take the ironman for example if 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.230
 now he is the popular superhero 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.090
 but before the movies but not 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.879
 he had not half the popularity that 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.400
 has now maybe a quarter maybe not 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:38.530
 or of course the guardians of the 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.449
 galaxy before the movie if you 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.370
 they mentioned to the guardians your reaction 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:45.160
 it would have been like 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.199
 but now everyone loves them and 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.809
 it seems that Marvel will make the 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.910
 yours with the inhumans to whom 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:55.030
 you probably do not know but you will 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.649
 because marvel as it is here my point 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.079
 I think there's a pretty concept 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:02.110
 interesting of the comics which deserves 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:05.740
 a movie like that is I'm talking about 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.250
 shield and I 'm not talking about ladies 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.080
 control 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.180
 You probably do not know what 's more 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.979
 good control basically are a 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.630
 company specialized in repairing 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.729
 property damage caused by 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.800
 conflicts between superheroes and 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.090
 super villains it makes sense who 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.429
 repair a city after events 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.649
 the avengers must have been metz 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:25.270
 control so just imagine what a 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:27.190
 movie about a group that must repair 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.750
 the disasters caused by superheroes 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.820
 in their battles against the super 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.920
 villains is a fun concept and 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.159
 interesting which could be used 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.500
 correctly somehow I do not know barber 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.240
 could be and now that we will have a 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.490
 movie the civil war could 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.280
 implement them a bit because the comics 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.720
 are involved in a certain way although 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.210
 that story includes wolverine and others 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.979
 things that I do not understand but probably 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.930
 could have them repairing the disaster 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.640
 after the events in sibiu world and 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.530
 you know the capitan america fights against 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.510
 iron man a conflict between superheroes 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.580
 that is probably going to cause disaster 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.350
 the city so they could put them to 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.790
 repair the disaster of whatever it is that 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.860
 happen ok 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.229
 they probably do not need a 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.509
 movie but I do not give up 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.760
 I want to see damage control appear in 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.230
 the marvel movie universe of 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.180
 somehow why not make a 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.010
 television miniseries about them 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.440
 or maybe just a bar ball workshop 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.690
 it would be enough that would be fine or at 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.610
 least mention that they exist after 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.830
 a battle or whatever maybe captain 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.650
 america says oh boy or district and 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.560
 we caused and then I discovered he says not you 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.840
 worry double control will take care of 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.080
 that's the same and then they could go eat their 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.300
 weapon or whatever is done maybe this 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.070
 It was useless but tell me how 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.769
 like to see the match in some way 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:47.410
 control maybe in a movie maybe 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.040
 in a series or whatever, leave your 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.680
 commentary 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.239
