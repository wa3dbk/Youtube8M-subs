00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
every person was to have so an equal

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.130 
every person was to have so an equal
amount<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:59.250> silver<00:00:59.850> divvied<00:01:00.480> up<00:01:00.570> between<00:01:00.629> all

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
amount of silver divvied up between all

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.950 
amount of silver divvied up between all
people<00:01:01.489> each<00:01:02.489> person<00:01:03.149> would<00:01:03.300> have<00:01:03.329> one

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
people each person would have one

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.450 
people each person would have one
fourteenth<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:05.220> an<00:01:05.610> ounce<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:06.150> silver<00:01:06.510> and

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
fourteenth of an ounce of silver and

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.210 
fourteenth of an ounce of silver and
because<00:01:08.460> silver<00:01:09.000> is<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.510> consumable<00:01:10.380> commodity

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
because silver is a consumable commodity

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.539 
because silver is a consumable commodity
which<00:01:11.909> it's<00:01:12.270> used<00:01:12.390> in<00:01:12.840> almost<00:01:13.549> everything

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
which it's used in almost everything

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.030 
which it's used in almost everything
that<00:01:14.850> i<00:01:15.060> can<00:01:15.240> any<00:01:15.570> electronic<00:01:16.439> it's<00:01:16.650> used<00:01:16.860> in

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
that i can any electronic it's used in

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.289 
that i can any electronic it's used in
mirrors<00:01:17.490> it's<00:01:17.700> used<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:18.000> old-time

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
mirrors it's used in old-time

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.450 
mirrors it's used in old-time
photography<00:01:18.990> it's<00:01:19.229> all<00:01:19.380> used<00:01:19.740> in<00:01:19.890> cell<00:01:20.130> phones

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
photography it's all used in cell phones

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.090 
photography it's all used in cell phones
used<00:01:20.850> in<00:01:21.000> RTI<00:01:21.299> f<00:01:21.540> chips<00:01:21.869> just<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.619> whole<00:01:22.830> nine

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
used in RTI f chips just the whole nine

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.190 
used in RTI f chips just the whole nine
yards<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:24.030> it's<00:01:24.240> getting<00:01:24.479> used<00:01:24.810> up<00:01:24.960> in<00:01:25.080> its

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
yards so it's getting used up in its

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.840 
yards so it's getting used up in its
these<00:01:25.290> itty<00:01:25.619> bitty<00:01:26.070> bitty<00:01:26.310> bitty<00:01:26.400> small

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
these itty bitty bitty bitty small

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.660 
these itty bitty bitty bitty small
increments<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.780> they<00:01:28.170> use<00:01:28.439> so<00:01:28.740> it's<00:01:28.890> hard<00:01:29.549> to

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
increments that they use so it's hard to

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.530 
increments that they use so it's hard to
recycle<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:32.189> supply<00:01:32.579> is<00:01:32.610> shrinking<00:01:33.360> a

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
recycle it so the supply is shrinking a

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.980 
recycle it so the supply is shrinking a
lot<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.619> so<00:01:35.280> that's<00:01:35.460> why<00:01:35.640> i<00:01:35.670> think<00:01:35.909> silver<00:01:36.780> is

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
lot and so that's why i think silver is

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.490 
lot and so that's why i think silver is
such<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.860> big<00:01:38.600> investment<00:01:39.600> play<00:01:39.869> right<00:01:40.110> now<00:01:40.140> and

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
such a big investment play right now and

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.670 
such a big investment play right now and
if<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:41.220> can<00:01:41.520> either<00:01:41.880> lab<00:01:42.570> said<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.530> you

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
if you can either lab said that you

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.469 
if you can either lab said that you
should<00:01:43.860> get<00:01:44.100> into<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.549> game<00:01:44.729> at<00:01:45.000> least<00:01:45.180> go

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
should get into the game at least go

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.120 
should get into the game at least go
down<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.810> your<00:01:45.869> silver<00:01:46.229> shop<00:01:46.439> there's<00:01:46.860> one

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
down to your silver shop there's one

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.740 
down to your silver shop there's one

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
nineteen sixty-five before money was

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.479 
nineteen sixty-five before money was
made<00:02:06.930> out<00:02:06.990> of<00:02:07.320> many<00:02:07.680> was<00:02:07.860> ruined<00:02:08.160> money<00:02:08.340> it

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
made out of many was ruined money it

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.330 
made out of many was ruined money it
wasn't<00:02:08.670> currency<00:02:09.390> which<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:10.830> was<00:02:10.979> actually

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
wasn't currency which it was actually

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.070 
wasn't currency which it was actually
had

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
had

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.120 
had
silver<00:02:12.800> in<00:02:13.040> it<00:02:13.300> so<00:02:14.300> I<00:02:14.630> a<00:02:14.960> dime<00:02:15.440> is<00:02:15.680> ninety

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
silver in it so I a dime is ninety

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.520 
silver in it so I a dime is ninety
percent<00:02:16.310> silver<00:02:17.240> so<00:02:17.780> you<00:02:17.840> had<00:02:18.170> a<00:02:18.590> tenth<00:02:19.160> of<00:02:19.400> I

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
percent silver so you had a tenth of I

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.900 
percent silver so you had a tenth of I
guess<00:02:21.530> it'd<00:02:21.710> be<00:02:21.830> announced<00:02:22.130> or<00:02:22.580> a<00:02:22.640> doll<00:02:22.880> a

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
guess it'd be announced or a doll a

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.240 
guess it'd be announced or a doll a
dollar<00:02:23.390> like<00:02:23.720> if<00:02:23.840> ever<00:02:24.110> a<00:02:24.170> dollar<00:02:24.380> coin<00:02:24.710> and<00:02:25.160> be

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
dollar like if ever a dollar coin and be

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.160 
dollar like if ever a dollar coin and be
it<00:02:25.370> to<00:02:25.490> be<00:02:25.580> a<00:02:25.610> tenth<00:02:25.910> of<00:02:26.030> that<00:02:26.090> at<00:02:26.450> ninety

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
it to be a tenth of that at ninety

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.140 
it to be a tenth of that at ninety
percent<00:02:27.380> so<00:02:27.920> it's<00:02:28.400> got<00:02:28.520> a<00:02:28.550> little<00:02:28.760> bit<00:02:28.910> about

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
percent so it's got a little bit about

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.030 
percent so it's got a little bit about
it<00:02:29.300> so<00:02:29.450> it's<00:02:29.780> not<00:02:29.870> gonna<00:02:29.990> be<00:02:30.110> as<00:02:30.260> expensive<00:02:30.650> if

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
it so it's not gonna be as expensive if

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.580

and<00:03:08.300> it<00:03:08.390> hasn't<00:03:08.930> I<00:03:09.050> expected<00:03:09.830> to<00:03:09.950> go<00:03:10.100> down

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
and it hasn't I expected to go down

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.190 
and it hasn't I expected to go down
because<00:03:10.670> another<00:03:11.270> thing<00:03:11.390> that<00:03:11.810> mutt<00:03:12.020> will

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
because another thing that mutt will

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.370 
because another thing that mutt will
only<00:03:12.350> shows<00:03:12.680> in<00:03:12.920> that<00:03:13.130> in<00:03:13.520> his<00:03:13.910> video<00:03:14.300> is<00:03:14.720> how

always something that was doing the
exact<00:03:22.880> opposite<00:03:23.600> so<00:03:24.380> the<00:03:24.650> fact<00:03:24.920> that<00:03:25.150> the

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150
