 I tend to say that the young sikh thousands of sad strats nor to 

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:14.309
 authors in this sense the writer 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.209
 because 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:18.439
 I made books 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.109
 I would say that I write books put in the sense that I write with 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.810
 text and image 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.290
 and I'm neither for nor a text nor their image entered 2nd writing to 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.989
 present collisions of text and image 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:33.350
 when I build a book 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.130
 Thursday manufactured almost 500 th 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.130
 in fact you have to think how to make an object 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.740
 which star is written in the text in the image but especially 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.240
 in the assembly of pages and for his wages the beauty and power of 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.770
 key high schools as we open a book 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.970
 % what was happening 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.150
 it's not on the web pages between the two floors 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.150
 it is true that we realize that it is gigantic 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.800
 in the smallest things 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.719
 I wanted to talk about the overflows 

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:09.590
 the Marseille a small garden 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:10.840
 % 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.560
 and every time she does not look 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.270
 beyond his garden 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.320
 elena 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.369
 it is overwhelmed by the antifreeze liquid but 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.740
 the ministers of the g20 he wields world 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.390
 when I built the book 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.620
 m 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.240
 in what I wanted to tell in relation to the overflows 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.350
 against the beauty of projects that ensure that they also do the same. 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.350
 sadness 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.180
 I wanted the crises in the texts and in pictures but also that the lives we 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.270
 overflowing hands 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.770
 and so if I eat almost air flap 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.060
 and then flap when we forget about 12 degrees 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.090
 very closed to flap the page before we have a level of panic 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.090
 a triptych 8 4 pages stretching before us 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.470
 and one physically in freeville parliamentarians is the same a little 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.910
 bulky does not notice much useful 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:04.180
 it's a book that does not tell much about Bernanke's narration but 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.710
 rather pulled in something 2 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.050
 very deep and at the same time very broad the slightest thing that 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.359
 would touch roger guarantee the power to m a universe too 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:17.590
 emanates from bone tissue this is a reflection on 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.979
 soft comments to the world 

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:23.489
 and finally it's done I share maybe a questioning killer 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:28.939
 very selfish he loves how I resist myself to the world and to his way of 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:30.809
