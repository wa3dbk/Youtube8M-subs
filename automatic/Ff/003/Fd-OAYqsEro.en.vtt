00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
justify why it's no longer going to take

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.480 
justify why it's no longer going to take
you<00:01:15.909> five<00:01:16.180> to<00:01:16.450> ten<00:01:16.630> minutes<00:01:17.189> it's<00:01:18.189> as<00:01:18.460> simple

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
on just a second ask the customer if

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.760 
on just a second ask the customer if
they<00:01:29.800> mind<00:01:30.159> you<00:01:30.760> putting<00:01:31.090> them<00:01:31.240> on<00:01:31.420> hold<00:01:31.770> make
