00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
electric choke on there it's about a

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.769 
electric choke on there it's about a
three<00:00:20.310> inch<00:00:20.430> bolt<00:00:20.730> pattern<00:00:21.060> down<00:00:21.210> here<00:00:21.570> this

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
three inch bolt pattern down here this

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
a light goes out that means it's

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.860 
a light goes out that means it's
calculating<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:53.969> that's<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.360> reading

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
calculating and that's the reading

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.779 
calculating and that's the reading
we're<00:00:55.559> wondering<00:00:55.770> reading<00:00:56.280> or<00:00:56.399> somewheres

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
we're wondering reading or somewheres

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
part of gas when we rev it up we want it

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.390 
part of gas when we rev it up we want it
to<00:01:05.460> thin<00:01:05.640> out<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.820> little<00:01:05.970> bit<00:01:06.420> for<00:01:07.170> economy<00:01:07.950> but

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
to thin out a little bit for economy but

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.740 
to thin out a little bit for economy but
that's<00:01:08.670> where<00:01:08.880> we<00:01:09.030> want<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.299> have<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.450> safe

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
that's where we want to have a safe

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.670 
that's where we want to have a safe
range<00:01:10.100> come<00:01:11.100> over<00:01:11.310> here

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
range come over here

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.429 
range come over here
what

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
what

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:17.320 
what
the<00:01:15.499> red<00:01:15.770> light

the red light

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:28.530 
the red light
right<00:01:17.900> there<00:01:18.760> calculating

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.240 

they're<00:01:29.050> all<00:01:29.230> the<00:01:29.320> light<00:01:29.500> though<00:01:29.740> they<00:01:29.950> see

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
they're all the light though they see

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.940 
they're all the light though they see
that<00:01:30.430> 12<00:01:30.760> let<00:01:31.270> me<00:01:31.360> begin<00:01:31.990> early<00:01:32.470> get<00:01:32.620> no<00:01:32.740> better

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
that 12 let me begin early get no better

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:40.330 
that 12 let me begin early get no better
than<00:01:33.100> that

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.580 

about<00:01:40.759> 13<00:01:41.299> everyone<00:01:41.689> was<00:01:41.869> gonna<00:01:42.109> fall<00:01:42.409> down

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
about 13 everyone was gonna fall down

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:52.740 
about 13 everyone was gonna fall down
the<00:01:42.770> road

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.510 

this<00:01:53.750> way<00:01:53.990> the<00:01:54.230> reason<00:01:54.530> we<00:01:54.650> do<00:01:54.770> the<00:01:54.920> video<00:01:55.190> is

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
this way the reason we do the video is

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.090 
this way the reason we do the video is
cuz<00:01:55.700> we<00:01:55.790> got<00:01:55.940> a<00:01:55.970> bunch<00:01:56.330> of<00:01:56.420> rookie<00:01:57.100> mechanics

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
cuz we got a bunch of rookie mechanics

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.410 
cuz we got a bunch of rookie mechanics
think<00:01:58.310> they<00:01:58.430> know<00:01:58.580> everything<00:01:58.850> and<00:01:59.030> they<00:01:59.210> get

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
think they know everything and they get

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.510 
think they know everything and they get
a<00:01:59.630> car<00:02:00.200> and<00:02:00.230> they<00:02:00.500> diagnose<00:02:01.070> it<00:02:01.310> and<00:02:01.400> they

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
a car and they diagnose it and they

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.730 
a car and they diagnose it and they
think<00:02:01.760> it's<00:02:01.910> carburetor<00:02:02.360> which<00:02:03.170> carburetors

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
think it's carburetor which carburetors

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.460 
think it's carburetor which carburetors
gets<00:02:03.950> blamed<00:02:04.190> on<00:02:04.550> everything<00:02:05.320> except<00:02:06.320> the
