00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:11.559 
video I wanted to do an unboxing and a

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:18.420 
video I wanted to do an unboxing and a
review<00:00:11.980> on<00:00:12.309> a<00:00:12.450> ThinkPad<00:00:13.469> USB<00:00:14.880> 3.1<00:00:17.189> but<00:00:18.189> not

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:18.430 
review on a ThinkPad USB 3.1 but not

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.670 
review on a ThinkPad USB 3.1 but not
your<00:00:18.610> typical<00:00:18.820> docking<00:00:19.480> station<00:00:19.899> it<00:00:20.619> is

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:20.680 
your typical docking station it is

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.179 
your typical docking station it is
actually<00:00:21.189> it<00:00:21.460> uses<00:00:21.849> a<00:00:21.880> USB<00:00:22.149> 3.0<00:00:22.689> so<00:00:23.470> instead<00:00:24.099> of

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:24.189 
actually it uses a USB 3.0 so instead of

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.109 
actually it uses a USB 3.0 so instead of
docking<00:00:24.849> the<00:00:25.000> actual<00:00:25.329> Cape<00:00:25.860> laptop<00:00:26.860> you<00:00:27.849> plug

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
docking the actual Cape laptop you plug

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:33.060 
docking the actual Cape laptop you plug
in<00:00:28.239> the<00:00:28.360> USB<00:00:28.509> 3.0<00:00:29.910> on<00:00:30.910> your<00:00:31.630> laptop<00:00:32.320> and<00:00:32.559> it

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
in the USB 3.0 on your laptop and it

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.060 
in the USB 3.0 on your laptop and it
uses<00:00:33.280> a<00:00:33.520> dark<00:00:33.790> and<00:00:34.090> basically<00:00:34.780> all<00:00:35.410> you<00:00:35.860> eat

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
uses a dark and basically all you eat

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:36.990 
uses a dark and basically all you eat
the<00:00:36.190> net<00:00:36.340> cords

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
the net cords

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.750 
the net cords
I<00:00:37.210> mean<00:00:37.960> you<00:00:38.020> eaten<00:00:38.290> a<00:00:38.350> cable<00:00:38.770> your<00:00:39.010> printers

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
I mean you eaten a cable your printers

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.230 
I mean you eaten a cable your printers
your<00:00:40.150> dual<00:00:40.570> monitors<00:00:40.990> all<00:00:41.230> in<00:00:41.380> here<00:00:41.680> so<00:00:42.520> let's

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:43.240 
your dual monitors all in here so let's

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.940 
your dual monitors all in here so let's
go<00:00:43.420> ahead<00:00:43.510> and<00:00:43.630> do<00:00:44.440> the<00:00:44.980> unboxing

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
go ahead and do the unboxing

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.380 
go ahead and do the unboxing
now<00:00:47.950> I've<00:00:48.100> already<00:00:48.250> open<00:00:48.610> this<00:00:48.730> but<00:00:48.910> Ivan<00:00:49.120> will

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
now I've already open this but Ivan will

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:58.710 
now I've already open this but Ivan will
take<00:00:50.140> it<00:00:50.290> out<00:00:50.380> of<00:00:50.530> the<00:00:50.590> box<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:58.390> basically

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:58.720 
take it out of the box so basically

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.800 
take it out of the box so basically
that's<00:00:58.900> it<00:00:59.560> says<00:00:59.770> right<00:00:59.950> there<00:01:00.120> big<00:01:01.120> pad<00:01:01.329> USB

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:01.810 
that's it says right there big pad USB

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.499 
that's it says right there big pad USB
3.0<00:01:02.350> dock<00:01:02.890> I<00:01:03.040> haven't<00:01:03.640> used<00:01:03.790> this<00:01:04.000> in<00:01:04.210> and

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:04.509 
3.0 dock I haven't used this in and

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:07.920 
3.0 dock I haven't used this in and
deploy<00:01:05.379> them<00:01:05.590> yet<00:01:06.270> we're<00:01:07.270> upgrading<00:01:07.540> our

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
deploy them yet we're upgrading our

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.240 
deploy them yet we're upgrading our
computers<00:01:08.710> and<00:01:09.520> a<00:01:09.970> lot<00:01:10.120> of<00:01:10.180> stops<00:01:10.360> at<00:01:10.510> work<00:01:10.720> and

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
computers and a lot of stops at work and

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.469 
computers and a lot of stops at work and
we're<00:01:12.250> moving<00:01:12.430> over<00:01:12.760> to<00:01:13.000> from<00:01:13.750> Dell<00:01:14.050> to

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
we're moving over to from Dell to

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.810 
we're moving over to from Dell to
thinkpads<00:01:16.479> Lenovo's<00:01:17.380> so<00:01:17.830> basically<00:01:18.640> that's

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
thinkpads Lenovo's so basically that's

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.719 
thinkpads Lenovo's so basically that's
how<00:01:18.970> it<00:01:19.120> looks<00:01:19.330> right<00:01:19.390> there<00:01:19.690> at<00:01:20.049> the<00:01:20.290> back<00:01:20.729> and

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
how it looks right there at the back and

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:24.719 
how it looks right there at the back and
this<00:01:22.330> is<00:01:22.540> just<00:01:22.780> kind<00:01:23.590> of<00:01:23.620> a<00:01:23.740> how-to<00:01:23.920> safety

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
this is just kind of a how-to safety

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.039 
this is just kind of a how-to safety
looks<00:01:25.150> like<00:01:25.330> what<00:01:25.450> it<00:01:25.540> was<00:01:26.280> safety<00:01:27.280> and<00:01:28.270> I'm

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
looks like what it was safety and I'm

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:30.210 
looks like what it was safety and I'm
assuming<00:01:29.290> you're<00:01:29.560> gonna<00:01:29.650> have<00:01:29.830> to<00:01:29.950> install

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
assuming you're gonna have to install

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.890 
assuming you're gonna have to install
this<00:01:30.430> software<00:01:30.729> here<00:01:31.680> for<00:01:32.680> to<00:01:32.920> communicate

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
this software here for to communicate

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.600 
this software here for to communicate
because<00:01:34.900> how<00:01:35.229> will<00:01:35.350> it<00:01:35.470> communicate<00:01:35.979> via<00:01:36.159> USB

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
because how will it communicate via USB

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:44.210 
because how will it communicate via USB
3.0<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:38.680> out<00:01:38.860> of<00:01:38.890> the<00:01:39.040> box<00:01:39.159> here<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:41.770> looks<00:01:42.010> like

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.179 

that's<00:01:45.220> the<00:01:45.340> USB<00:01:45.970> 3.0<00:01:46.240> and<00:01:47.229> the<00:01:47.710> other<00:01:47.860> doesn't

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189 
that's the USB 3.0 and the other doesn't

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:50.070 
that's the USB 3.0 and the other doesn't
not<00:01:48.549> there<00:01:49.030> there<00:01:49.210> and<00:01:49.299> does<00:01:49.450> not<00:01:49.689> look<00:01:49.930> like

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
not there there and does not look like

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.390 
not there there and does not look like
your<00:01:50.260> typical<00:01:50.700> USB<00:01:52.950> it's<00:01:53.950> like<00:01:54.100> it's<00:01:54.280> like

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
your typical USB it's like it's like

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.490 
your typical USB it's like it's like
powered<00:01:55.020> okay<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.850> this<00:01:58.810> looks<00:01:59.110> like<00:01:59.259> your

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
powered okay and this looks like your

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.109 
powered okay and this looks like your
VGA<00:02:00.009> and<00:02:00.610> DVI<00:02:01.110> DVI<00:02:02.110> to<00:02:02.170> VGA<00:02:02.650> dongle<00:02:03.460> that's

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
VGA and DVI DVI to VGA dongle that's

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.390 
VGA and DVI DVI to VGA dongle that's
nice<00:02:04.360> that<00:02:04.570> they<00:02:04.659> throw<00:02:04.869> that<00:02:05.020> in<00:02:05.400> usually

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
nice that they throw that in usually

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.179 
nice that they throw that in usually
they<00:02:06.520> make<00:02:06.670> your<00:02:06.850> vitals<00:02:07.799> get<00:02:08.799> your<00:02:08.950> power

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:09.189 
they make your vitals get your power

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:18.060 
they make your vitals get your power
cord<00:02:09.779> that's<00:02:10.779> pretty<00:02:11.019> straightforward

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.120 

and<00:02:19.270> here<00:02:20.270> it<00:02:20.330> is<00:02:20.450> it's<00:02:21.110> nice<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:21.530> small<00:02:21.710> and

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
and here it is it's nice and small and

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.180 
and here it is it's nice and small and
the<00:02:22.910> cool<00:02:23.120> thing<00:02:23.270> about<00:02:23.330> this<00:02:23.630> is<00:02:23.950> why<00:02:24.950> we're

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
the cool thing about this is why we're

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.470 
the cool thing about this is why we're
moving<00:02:25.370> into<00:02:25.700> this<00:02:25.790> instead<00:02:26.150> of<00:02:26.240> your<00:02:26.330> typical

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
moving into this instead of your typical

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.410 
moving into this instead of your typical
docking<00:02:27.050> station<00:02:27.410> is<00:02:27.500> that<00:02:27.530> you<00:02:28.400> know<00:02:28.520> laptops

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
docking station is that you know laptops

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.420 
docking station is that you know laptops
change<00:02:29.780> quite<00:02:30.140> often<00:02:30.350> and<00:02:30.860> every<00:02:31.070> time<00:02:31.280> you

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
change quite often and every time you

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.390 
change quite often and every time you
change<00:02:31.700> you<00:02:32.000> know<00:02:32.440> we<00:02:33.440> typically<00:02:33.890> do<00:02:34.130> about<00:02:34.370> a

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
change you know we typically do about a

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.100 
change you know we typically do about a
refresh<00:02:34.850> every<00:02:35.270> three<00:02:35.510> years<00:02:35.540> so<00:02:35.870> basically

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
refresh every three years so basically

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.720 
refresh every three years so basically
we<00:02:36.500> get<00:02:36.620> new<00:02:36.830> machines<00:02:37.010> every<00:02:37.490> three<00:02:37.700> years

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
we get new machines every three years

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.420 
we get new machines every three years
for<00:02:38.180> our<00:02:39.170> users<00:02:39.530> and<00:02:39.709> the<00:02:39.800> problem<00:02:40.280> with<00:02:40.400> that

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
for our users and the problem with that

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.100 
for our users and the problem with that

something happen physically broken you
can't<00:02:47.000> be<00:02:47.120> fixed<00:02:47.450> or<00:02:47.540> if<00:02:48.470> not<00:02:48.650> being<00:02:48.890> fixed<00:02:50.320> it

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
can't be fixed or if not being fixed it

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.920 
can't be fixed or if not being fixed it
you<00:02:51.739> I<00:02:52.100> mean<00:02:52.250> there's<00:02:53.209> no<00:02:53.330> replacement

you I mean there's no replacement

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.060 
you I mean there's no replacement
because<00:02:54.260> it's<00:02:54.530> outdated

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
because it's outdated

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.820 
because it's outdated
they<00:02:55.970> don't<00:02:56.120> stock<00:02:56.480> them<00:02:56.600> anymore<00:02:57.050> is<00:02:57.110> that

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
they don't stock them anymore is that

you have to get a new model and what

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.250 
you have to get a new model and what
happens<00:03:00.020> we<00:03:00.110> need<00:03:00.200> a<00:03:00.350> new<00:03:00.470> model<00:03:00.920> is<00:03:01.130> that<00:03:02.260> you

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
happens we need a new model is that you

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.240 
happens we need a new model is that you
might<00:03:03.410> not<00:03:03.560> be<00:03:03.650> able<00:03:03.739> to<00:03:03.860> use<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.100> same

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
might not be able to use the same

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.100 
might not be able to use the same
docking<00:03:04.610> station<00:03:05.030> that's<00:03:05.480> a<00:03:05.570> problem<00:03:05.930> because

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
docking station that's a problem because

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.820 
docking station that's a problem because
then<00:03:06.380> it<00:03:07.100> be<00:03:07.340> it's<00:03:07.610> not<00:03:07.760> cost-effective<00:03:08.830> it

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
then it be it's not cost-effective it

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.229 
then it be it's not cost-effective it
cost<00:03:10.100> you<00:03:10.220> more<00:03:10.340> money<00:03:10.400> because<00:03:10.910> you<00:03:11.060> have<00:03:11.150> to

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
cost you more money because you have to

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:12.520 
cost you more money because you have to
replace<00:03:11.480> a<00:03:11.540> docking<00:03:11.930> station<00:03:11.959> at<00:03:12.290> the<00:03:12.320> same

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
replace a docking station at the same

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.890 
replace a docking station at the same
time<00:03:12.800> and<00:03:13.790> we<00:03:14.060> can<00:03:14.180> figure<00:03:14.330> everything<00:03:14.660> so<00:03:14.810> the

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
time and we can figure everything so the

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.620 
time and we can figure everything so the
beautiful<00:03:15.530> thing<00:03:15.680> about<00:03:15.890> this<00:03:16.070> is<00:03:16.280> that<00:03:16.630> it's

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
beautiful thing about this is that it's

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.690 
beautiful thing about this is that it's
universal<00:03:18.260> so<00:03:18.620> as<00:03:18.709> long<00:03:18.830> as<00:03:18.920> you<00:03:19.070> have<00:03:19.160> a<00:03:19.220> USB

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
universal so as long as you have a USB

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.120 
universal so as long as you have a USB
3.0<00:03:20.060> you<00:03:20.750> can<00:03:21.350> use<00:03:21.500> this<00:03:21.620> as<00:03:21.739> a<00:03:21.799> docking

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
3.0 you can use this as a docking

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.000 
3.0 you can use this as a docking
station<00:03:22.160> so<00:03:22.820> it's<00:03:22.970> fine<00:03:23.150> enough<00:03:23.739> take<00:03:24.739> a<00:03:24.769> look

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
station so it's fine enough take a look

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.100 
station so it's fine enough take a look
at<00:03:25.510> going<00:03:26.510> back<00:03:26.720> with<00:03:27.290> the<00:03:27.440> Box<00:03:27.680> aside<00:03:28.750> and<00:03:29.750> see

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
at going back with the Box aside and see

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:38.070 
at going back with the Box aside and see
if<00:03:30.200> I<00:03:30.290> can<00:03:30.500> open<00:03:30.650> this<00:03:31.010> with<00:03:31.250> one<00:03:31.610> hand

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.040 

so<00:03:39.080> as<00:03:39.620> always<00:03:40.100> they<00:03:40.460> had<00:03:40.670> that<00:03:40.940> kind<00:03:41.870> of<00:03:41.900> a

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050
