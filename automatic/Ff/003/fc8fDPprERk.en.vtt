00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:12.389
 Hello everyone, today we will make an oil together 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.790
 particular is called a boom oil 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.800
 and in fact practically with one 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.550
 powder that you can find from the novel 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.410
 nor of their own hulu.com dust 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:26.420
 this oil is an excellent oil for the summer 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.830
 because why the rich in beta-carotene 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.830
 favors the tan prepares the 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.510
 skin in the sun and is and also a level 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.100
 very low protection so it is 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.770
 You can also use it on the beach 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.840
 or to make the skin elastic and 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.770
 bright because in this color a lot 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.559
 very strong 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.809
 I will show you this orange color 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.559
 however how it is done is very simple to 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.230
 to achieve 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.539
 you will need these oils in particular 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.910
 way to the oil of shea and the oil of 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.120
 sesame because why these two oils 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.820
 they have in themselves a protection 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.570
 against very low UV rays but ce 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.250
 they 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.470
 or you could use oil from 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.570
 coconut although in reality it is much more 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.610
 low protection of coconut oil 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.960
 so if you add coconut oil to one 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.330
 of these two oils it becomes a good oil e 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.250
 you need hulu.com dust like 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.820
 I told you that you can find it in Rome 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:24.689
 john how to prepare you have to put 5 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:29.610
 grams of this powder and 50 grams of 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:32.420
 shea oil or coconut oil and 50 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.130
 grams of sesame oil 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:39.000
 then close the jar and it 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:42.030
 cover with aluminum foil to cover the 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.299
 good with this card and then it will have to stand 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:49.619
 in maceration for about 10 15 days a 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:51.689
 sun by day and dark by night 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.549
 stir occasionally shaken from time to time 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.850
 the barter in such a way that the dust 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.540
 don't stop under the jar anyway 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:03.350
 but in any case mix well 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.600
 of the oils after which after 10 15 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.060
 days you have to filter the finger oil 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.450
 then filter it well so that 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.700
 do not leave the dust in the oil and one 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.850
 once filtered you can use the 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.460
 your oil as I said you can 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:21.560
 use on the beach maybe not in the 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.600
 hot hours maybe even using the 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.670
 basic sun protection or 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.340
 you could use it 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.500
 after the shower to illuminate again of 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.100
 more tan because this color 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.550
 gives a luminous effect to the 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.490
 skin 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.900
