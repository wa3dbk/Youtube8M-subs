00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:16.760
 we definitely see that both 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.760
 accessibility and the 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:24.360
 the tendency of increase of the 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:27.360
 users towards the internet connection going 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.760
 increasing both the penetration in 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.949
 Internet users entering on 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.400
 everything through mobile the intention of 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.400
 huawei 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.059
 not only locally at the global level 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.579
 is investing a lot at the level of 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.950
 technology development allowing 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.080
 that their costs are much more efficient 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.840
 the intention that we have with this team 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.190
 is that 4g technology or access to 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.350
 this through mobile phones does not have 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.980
 what being expensive does not have to be 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:00.210
 difficult and it is the intention that we have is 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:03.329
 be able to make accessible 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.250
 the new network and access to it through 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:10.340
 from a smartphone 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:14.920
 that is not difficult d 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.920
 to get not to access 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:23.830
 specifically in the time of 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:27.780
 answer either by accessing the networks 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.780
 either downloading information 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:35.390
 the typical users that download 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.710
 music that usually download videos 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.870
 an average user is always 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.130
 pushed a smartphone 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:45.140
 for these multimedia tasks the photos 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:48.110
 It is interesting how it has affected the 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.750
 camera market in general then 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.790
 we see a very deep-rooted trend 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:57.160
 that the smartphone has everything and every time 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.160
 more be a very complete device 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.430
 practically on the screen the 4.5 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.500
 inches 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.259
 I think the thickness is 16 millimeters 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:12.900
 It has local metal finishes which 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:15.720
 makes the 5 megapixel camera stylish 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:19.980
 has a front camera too for 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.980
 0.3 megapixel video conferencing 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.960
 the battery that is what I tell you that is 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.770
 important thousand 950 milliamps something 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.870
 important is also the dual the 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.370
 dual microphone that what it does is that 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.360
 just the calls are every time 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.910
 clearer has a 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.210
 let's say that both the sound and the 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.680
 voice enter through different microphones what 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.800
 that makes clarity much better 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.140
 and other 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.700
 the software allows to differentiate between 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.560
 these and clarify much more the hbo and the 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.490
 our sound is important at the level of 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.490
 experience the balance
