a really interesting way of describing
the<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.530> picture<00:01:50.159> here<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.549> big<00:01:50.700> picture<00:01:50.939> you

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
the the picture here the big picture you

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.359 
the the picture here the big picture you
know<00:01:51.750> in<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:51.990> u.s.<00:01:52.259> we<00:01:52.470> have<00:01:52.740> this<00:01:52.920> mentality

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
know in the u.s. we have this mentality

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.050 
know in the u.s. we have this mentality
that<00:01:53.729> bigger<00:01:54.270> bigger<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.470> better<00:01:55.799> what<00:01:56.729> can<00:01:56.909> be

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
that bigger bigger is better what can be

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.350 
that bigger bigger is better what can be
done<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.570> change<00:01:57.689> this<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.829> change<00:01:59.189> this<00:01:59.700> kind

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
done to change this to change this kind

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.920 
done to change this to change this kind
of<00:02:00.479> culture<00:02:01.079> of<00:02:01.259> consumption<00:02:02.689> that's<00:02:03.689> right

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
of culture of consumption that's right

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.150 
of culture of consumption that's right
so<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.500> bigger<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:04.920> better<00:02:05.070> mentality<00:02:05.460> um<00:02:06.299> is

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
so the bigger and better mentality um is

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.279 
so the bigger and better mentality um is
kind<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.310> pervasive<00:02:08.640> in<00:02:09.030> our<00:02:09.149> system<00:02:09.660> so<00:02:09.929> the

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
kind of pervasive in our system so the

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.660 
kind of pervasive in our system so the
the<00:02:10.590> waste<00:02:10.830> is<00:02:11.039> happening<00:02:11.489> actually

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
the waste is happening actually

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.520 
the waste is happening actually
throughout<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.420> supply<00:02:12.599> chain<00:02:12.810> from

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
throughout the supply chain from

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.110 
throughout the supply chain from
from<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.770> farm<00:02:14.010> all<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.370> way<00:02:14.459> to<00:02:14.520> our<00:02:14.819> plates

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
from the farm all the way to our plates

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.000 
from the farm all the way to our plates
but<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.930> two<00:02:16.170> main<00:02:16.410> places<00:02:16.680> where<00:02:16.950> it's

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
but the two main places where it's

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.000 
but the two main places where it's
happening<00:02:17.490> are<00:02:17.730> in<00:02:18.540> grocery<00:02:19.140> stores<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.740> then

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
happening are in grocery stores and then

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.160 
happening are in grocery stores and then
on<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.310> consumer<00:02:20.850> end<00:02:21.000> so<00:02:21.390> in<00:02:21.569> restaurants

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
on the consumer end so in restaurants

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.199 
on the consumer end so in restaurants
and<00:02:22.230> in<00:02:22.380> our<00:02:22.500> kitchen<00:02:22.890> so<00:02:23.220> in<00:02:23.580> grocery<00:02:24.180> stores

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
and in our kitchen so in grocery stores

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
realize this but portion sizes have

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.880 
realize this but portion sizes have
really<00:03:24.420> gotten<00:03:24.630> out<00:03:24.900> of<00:03:24.959> control<00:03:25.260> they<00:03:25.739> just

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
really gotten out of control they just

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.400 
really gotten out of control they just
got<00:03:26.010> bigger<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.579> bigger<00:03:26.760> and<00:03:27.120> bigger<00:03:27.410> the

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
average portion size now is over eight

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.220 
average portion size now is over eight
times<00:03:32.430> what<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:32.910> government<00:03:33.329> recommends<00:03:33.810> and

started donating food to to food banks

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:09.890 
started donating food to to food banks
we<00:06:06.300> also<00:06:06.510> see<00:06:07.080> that<00:06:07.320> on<00:06:08.160> the<00:06:08.730> farm<00:06:09.150> a<00:06:09.480> lot<00:06:09.750> of

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 
we also see that on the farm a lot of

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.340 
we also see that on the farm a lot of
times<00:06:10.169> food<00:06:10.680> gets<00:06:10.919> discarded<00:06:11.370> just<00:06:11.760> because

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:12.350 
times food gets discarded just because

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:15.080 
times food gets discarded just because
the<00:06:13.350> price<00:06:13.650> the<00:06:13.919> farmer<00:06:14.250> would<00:06:14.370> get<00:06:14.520> paid<00:06:14.790> for

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.090 
the price the farmer would get paid for

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.480 
the price the farmer would get paid for
it<00:06:15.150> is<00:06:15.450> actually<00:06:15.930> not<00:06:16.080> enough<00:06:16.440> to<00:06:16.650> cover<00:06:16.860> their

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490 
it is actually not enough to cover their

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.240 
it is actually not enough to cover their
cost<00:06:17.790> of<00:06:18.090> labor<00:06:18.360> so<00:06:19.260> instead<00:06:19.620> we're<00:06:19.980> seeing

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.250 
cost of labor so instead we're seeing

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.760 
cost of labor so instead we're seeing
some<00:06:21.060> organizations<00:06:21.750> that<00:06:21.990> will<00:06:22.410> bring

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.770 
some organizations that will bring

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.470 
some organizations that will bring
people<00:06:23.190> into<00:06:23.310> the<00:06:23.400> farm<00:06:23.760> and<00:06:23.940> actually<00:06:24.270> have

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:24.480 
people into the farm and actually have

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.850 
people into the farm and actually have
them<00:06:24.690> harvest<00:06:24.990> some<00:06:25.320> of<00:06:25.410> those<00:06:25.500> fruits<00:06:25.740> and

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:25.860 
them harvest some of those fruits and

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.850 
them harvest some of those fruits and
vegetables<00:06:26.280> and<00:06:26.460> take<00:06:26.669> them<00:06:26.910> to<00:06:26.940> food<00:06:27.690> banks

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
vegetables and take them to food banks

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.130 
vegetables and take them to food banks
it's<00:06:28.860> kind<00:06:28.980> of<00:06:29.100> a<00:06:29.220> win-win<00:06:29.700> the<00:06:30.540> farmer

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:31.140 
it's kind of a win-win the farmer

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:32.600 
it's kind of a win-win the farmer
doesn't<00:06:31.290> have<00:06:31.470> to<00:06:31.620> discard<00:06:32.040> that<00:06:32.190> food<00:06:32.430> and

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:32.610 
doesn't have to discard that food and

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.850 
doesn't have to discard that food and
sometimes<00:06:32.910> they<00:06:33.000> get<00:06:33.090> a<00:06:33.150> tax<00:06:33.390> break<00:06:33.650> and<00:06:34.650> that

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:34.860 
sometimes they get a tax break and that

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.620 
sometimes they get a tax break and that
food<00:06:35.100> can<00:06:35.250> go<00:06:35.400> to<00:06:35.460> people<00:06:35.850> to<00:06:36.150> people<00:06:36.300> who<00:06:36.479> need

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:36.630 
food can go to people to people who need

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.659

stark<00:06:39.030> contrast<00:06:39.720> there

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:40.280 
stark contrast there

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.490 
stark contrast there
hopefully<00:06:41.280> people<00:06:41.310> can<00:06:41.630> stop<00:06:42.630> wasting<00:06:42.870> and
