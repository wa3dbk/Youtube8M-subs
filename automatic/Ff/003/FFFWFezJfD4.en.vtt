didn't do any school or gonna open up my
backpack<00:02:12.850> but<00:02:13.810> I<00:02:13.840> just<00:02:14.140> you<00:02:14.260> know<00:02:14.319> I<00:02:14.440> get<00:02:14.830> to

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
backpack but I just you know I get to

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.620 
backpack but I just you know I get to
school<00:02:15.370> and<00:02:15.670> then<00:02:15.730> also<00:02:15.910> we<00:02:16.150> have<00:02:16.300> these<00:02:16.420> huge

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
school and then also we have these huge

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:17.430 
school and then also we have these huge
tests

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
tests

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.350 
tests
and<00:02:17.620> I<00:02:17.920> just<00:02:18.070> think<00:02:18.340> that<00:02:18.490> breaks<00:02:18.820> do<00:02:19.060> us<00:02:19.180> more

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
and I just think that breaks do us more

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.940 
and I just think that breaks do us more
harm<00:02:19.660> than<00:02:20.080> do<00:02:20.260> is<00:02:20.380> good<00:02:20.650> sometimes

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
harm than do is good sometimes

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.520 
harm than do is good sometimes
especially<00:02:21.850> when<00:02:22.090> teachers<00:02:22.360> plan<00:02:22.720> on<00:02:22.990> doing

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
especially when teachers plan on doing

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.220 
especially when teachers plan on doing
those<00:02:23.650> huge<00:02:23.980> tests<00:02:24.520> at<00:02:24.820> the<00:02:25.270> end<00:02:25.480> of<00:02:25.780> our<00:02:25.930> break
