00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:12.410
 We all know good evening in this time in 3 minutes 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:16.460
 You can watch TV dvd while driving with no processing 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:22.550
 Easy way in terms of 4 of Honda compilation 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:24.280
 Let me introduce the construction method with cr z Fit Shuttle Fit Hybrid etc. 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:31.120
 You will receive 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:35.930
 Since the other adaptation persona and the details are put in the direction of my site , 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:40.810
 I hope you can see from the overview below the video 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:46.060
 Then we will introduce you to the construction method. 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:47.760
 First of all, please remove the navigation body as usual 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.530
 Rally the building 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:57.680
 Exactly the same as this coupler 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:01:04.250
 Because there is a coupler of p p , you will first look for this coupler 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:07.020
 And in this case I think that two couplers of p couplers are connected 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.120
 All you need is this defeat 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.270
 It is this wiring 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:19.380
 This defeat 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:22.680
 I will pull it out on this distant leaf island where the octopus grilled is like this 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:26.939
 My video on how to wear wiring 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:32.600
 Than I am terminal crimping strangely so described in more detail 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:35.900
 It would be nice if you could see it from the link on the top left 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:40.280
 Then first remove the 0 lock 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.780
 Just put a needle in here because it's stiff and it's time to get rid of the lock 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.810
 I will 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:49.909
 Then remove the second lock 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:53.080
 In feel like I'll just be inserted here to needle it is if the bottom of the terminal or the like, etc. 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:02:00.400
 I have a terminal 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:02:05.240
 And please insulate and cure the way of the genuine wiring that you have pulled out firmly 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:10.459
 And curing the shell of when you're done, please keep in fixed to the glans 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:14.230
 And I was crimped in advance to the part I just removed 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:17.430
 It's a make series and crimped wiring 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.430
 Insert 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:26.360
 Here 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:30.770
 It feels like you eat the second lock again if you insert it in 4 places 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:36.020
 How to make this wire is also my video 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:40.090
 Since the bus it is terminal crimping strangely so described in more detail visit together there also 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.090
 It would be appreciated 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:47.970
 And again , I was connected to the navigation body as it was . 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.080
 Geography 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:56.420
 It ends here here of wiring this 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.420
 It is successful completion if you can earth 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:03.939
 Do not know anything 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:09.849
 In addition, if there is a request that you want to comment in this model 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:11.520
 5 flights and the run also my ruling of the video is saved if you can connect from twitter, etc. 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:16.819
 I will 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:20.590
 Then thank you for seeing to the last minute 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:24.620
 It would be nice if we could see you in the next video 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.620
 Then excuse me 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.620
 Hmm
