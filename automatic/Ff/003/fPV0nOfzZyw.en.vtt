 she expects me to be very well i am 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.539
 mireia when I have more ideas for 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.280
 give away the valentine I think this is 

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:14.139
 the first tutorial we do about 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.059
 some food and we're going to use some 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.250
 popcorn with chocolate and we're going to 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.980
 decorate to give them on February 14 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:24.039
 we're going to need popcorn and chocolate 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.990
 It is white and pink 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.599
 first let's do the popcorn in 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.599
 the microwave and then we're going to reduce the 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:33.730
 chocolate also in the microwave we go 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:37.530
 to put a plastic bag inside 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.530
 a glass and empty we have the chocolate 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.620
 Now let's cut a corner 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:47.870
 of the bag and so we will put the chocolate 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.329
 about popcorn you can make them 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.309
 one color or mix several I them 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.559
 add some small chocolates for 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.149
 color you can also put nut 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.949
 in pieces or some other ingredient 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.140
 that you like and get along with the 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.449
 chocolate then we will put the popcorn 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.250
 in a plastic bag and we will make a 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.640
 knot with a nice ribbon and they will be 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.640
 lists 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.610
 taking advantage here we already have the 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.479
 chocolate so we can use it to 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.479
 decorate chocolates 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.940
 these chocolates we can also 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.920
 turn them into palettes and we put a 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.900
 plastic stick and we keep them in 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.150
 a plastic bag and then you 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.150
 we make a knot with a nice ribbon 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.530
 I hope you liked these ideas 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.659

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.520

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.979

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.259
