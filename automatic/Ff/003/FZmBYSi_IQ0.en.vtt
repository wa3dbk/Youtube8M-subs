00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
usually fix the problem by placing my

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.160 
usually fix the problem by placing my
iPod<00:00:37.380> in<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:38.040> case<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.719> pushing<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:39.840> from<00:00:39.960> the

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
iPod in the case and pushing it from the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.979 
iPod in the case and pushing it from the
bottom<00:00:40.440> so<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.829> will<00:00:40.860> squeeze<00:00:41.129> up<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.640> top

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
bottom so it will squeeze up to the top

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.650 
bottom so it will squeeze up to the top
so<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.620> power<00:00:43.860> buttons<00:00:44.280> can<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.539> know

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
so that the power buttons can you know

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.160

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
time I'd probably slide down a little

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.880 
time I'd probably slide down a little
bit<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.420> people<00:00:52.170> really<00:00:52.440> don't<00:00:52.530> notice<00:00:52.739> it
