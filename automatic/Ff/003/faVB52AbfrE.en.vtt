have a view and fill port right here and

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.089 
have a view and fill port right here and
we<00:02:30.650> also<00:02:30.829> have<00:02:31.099> a<00:02:31.640> vacuum<00:02:32.409> set<00:02:33.409> up<00:02:33.560> for<00:02:34.069> a

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
we also have a vacuum set up for a

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.670 
we also have a vacuum set up for a
vacuum<00:02:34.579> gauge<00:02:34.819> and<00:02:35.060> if<00:02:35.180> we<00:02:35.299> follow<00:02:35.569> that<00:02:35.689> all

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
vacuum gauge and if we follow that all

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.240 
vacuum gauge and if we follow that all
the<00:02:36.739> way<00:02:36.920> around<00:02:37.930> that'll<00:02:38.930> take<00:02:39.110> us<00:02:39.290> to<00:02:39.920> our

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
the way around that'll take us to our

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.770 
the way around that'll take us to our
vacuum<00:02:41.060> gauge<00:02:41.450> right<00:02:41.989> there<00:02:42.970> now<00:02:43.970> if<00:02:44.269> you<00:02:44.540> look

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
vacuum gauge right there now if you look

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.880 
vacuum gauge right there now if you look
across<00:02:44.900> here<00:02:45.610> you'll<00:02:46.610> see<00:02:47.049> the<00:02:48.049> outbound<00:02:48.500> tube

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
across here you'll see the outbound tube

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.339 
across here you'll see the outbound tube
which<00:02:49.400> I<00:02:49.549> have<00:02:49.760> right<00:02:49.970> here<00:02:50.030> if<00:02:50.480> you<00:02:50.750> follow<00:02:51.019> it

which I have right here if you follow it
and<00:02:51.609> keep<00:02:52.609> going<00:02:52.819> with<00:02:53.180> it<00:02:53.209> the<00:02:54.079> outbound<00:02:54.500> tube

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
and keep going with it the outbound tube

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.379 
and keep going with it the outbound tube
goes<00:02:55.790> over<00:02:56.150> there<00:02:57.310> to<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:58.340> intake<00:02:58.790> plenum<00:02:59.030> on

intake manifold when you're idling when
you're<00:03:14.510> cruising<00:03:15.079> and<00:03:15.940> decelerating<00:03:16.940> but

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
you're cruising and decelerating but

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.289 
you're cruising and decelerating but
when<00:03:17.930> you<00:03:18.109> go<00:03:18.349> and<00:03:18.650> accelerate<00:03:19.609> your<00:03:19.790> vehicle

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
when you go and accelerate your vehicle

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.990 
when you go and accelerate your vehicle
what<00:03:21.139> happens<00:03:21.560> is<00:03:21.709> is<00:03:21.980> that<00:03:22.159> vacuum<00:03:22.670> which<00:03:22.849> is

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
what happens is is that vacuum which is

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.930 
what happens is is that vacuum which is
normally<00:03:23.420> about<00:03:23.510> 17<00:03:24.260> inches<00:03:24.519> that<00:03:25.519> vacuum

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
normally about 17 inches that vacuum

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.420 
normally about 17 inches that vacuum
will<00:03:26.120> drop<00:03:26.299> down<00:03:26.510> to<00:03:26.660> 7<00:03:27.079> inches<00:03:27.199> thus<00:03:28.190> you're

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
will drop down to 7 inches thus you're

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.819 
will drop down to 7 inches thus you're
using<00:03:28.639> more<00:03:29.090> gasoline<00:03:29.389> than<00:03:30.379> you<00:03:30.590> are

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
using more gasoline than you are

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:33.460 
using more gasoline than you are
hydrogen<00:03:31.250> and<00:03:31.489> oxygen<00:03:31.930> so<00:03:32.930> what<00:03:33.109> I've<00:03:33.260> gone

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
hydrogen and oxygen so what I've gone

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.770 
hydrogen and oxygen so what I've gone
and<00:03:33.680> done<00:03:33.769> is<00:03:34.160> I<00:03:34.579> have<00:03:34.609> made<00:03:35.090> a<00:03:35.120> tee<00:03:35.419> joint

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
and done is I have made a tee joint

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.369 
and done is I have made a tee joint
right<00:03:36.260> here<00:03:36.290> and<00:03:37.389> I<00:03:38.389> brought<00:03:38.660> that<00:03:38.870> T<00:03:39.049> joint

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:39.379 
right here and I brought that T joint

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:42.640 
right here and I brought that T joint
down<00:03:39.620> with<00:03:40.370> a<00:03:40.400> gas-liquid<00:03:40.730> valve<00:03:41.449> and<00:03:41.750> teed<00:03:42.620> it

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
down with a gas-liquid valve and teed it

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.699 
down with a gas-liquid valve and teed it
and<00:03:43.269> then<00:03:44.269> I've<00:03:44.389> brought<00:03:44.660> both<00:03:44.959> ends<00:03:45.290> of<00:03:45.590> it

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
and then I've brought both ends of it

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:51.640 
and then I've brought both ends of it
around<00:03:47.319> 12<00:03:48.319> here<00:03:48.620> as<00:03:48.769> you<00:03:49.609> can<00:03:49.760> see<00:03:50.000> and<00:03:50.650> then

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
around 12 here as you can see and then

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.339 
around 12 here as you can see and then
another<00:03:51.919> one<00:03:52.129> over<00:03:52.370> to<00:03:52.940> here<00:03:53.150> because<00:03:53.930> there

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:54.349 
another one over to here because there

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:57.550 
another one over to here because there
are<00:03:54.470> two<00:03:54.769> tubes<00:03:55.129> on<00:03:55.459> afford<00:03:56.359> that<00:03:56.720> go<00:03:56.930> over<00:03:56.959> and

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
are two tubes on afford that go over and

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.970 
are two tubes on afford that go over and
into<00:03:58.160> the<00:03:58.280> intake<00:03:58.730> plenum<00:03:59.410> so<00:04:00.410> I<00:04:00.440> have<00:04:00.709> one

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
into the intake plenum so I have one

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.180 
into the intake plenum so I have one
here<00:04:01.340> which<00:04:01.579> draws<00:04:01.879> by<00:04:02.180> a<00:04:02.989> venturi<00:04:03.530> action<00:04:04.010> and

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
here which draws by a venturi action and

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.430 
here which draws by a venturi action and
one<00:04:05.060> there<00:04:05.299> that<00:04:05.480> draws<00:04:05.720> by<00:04:05.959> a<00:04:05.989> venture

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
one there that draws by a venture

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.949 
one there that draws by a venture
reaction<00:04:06.949> so<00:04:07.790> what<00:04:07.970> happens<00:04:08.389> when<00:04:08.780> you're

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
reaction so what happens when you're

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:13.659 
reaction so what happens when you're
accelerating<00:04:10.180> instead<00:04:11.180> of<00:04:11.389> the<00:04:12.109> fuel<00:04:12.669> which

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:13.669 
accelerating instead of the fuel which

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:16.779 
accelerating instead of the fuel which
is<00:04:13.879> coming<00:04:14.569> through<00:04:14.780> this<00:04:14.930> feed<00:04:15.230> tube<00:04:15.789> instead

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:16.789 
is coming through this feed tube instead

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:19.750 
is coming through this feed tube instead
of<00:04:17.000> that<00:04:17.150> fuel<00:04:17.479> going<00:04:18.139> toward<00:04:19.099> the<00:04:19.159> engine<00:04:19.639> and

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
of that fuel going toward the engine and

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.029 
of that fuel going toward the engine and
the<00:04:19.820> vacuum<00:04:20.359> dropping<00:04:20.989> off<00:04:21.169> and<00:04:21.440> using<00:04:21.829> more

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:22.039 
the vacuum dropping off and using more

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:25.270 
the vacuum dropping off and using more
gasoline<00:04:22.780> the<00:04:23.780> vacuum<00:04:24.199> will<00:04:24.380> drop<00:04:24.650> off<00:04:24.919> and

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
gasoline the vacuum will drop off and

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.909 
gasoline the vacuum will drop off and
instead<00:04:25.639> a<00:04:26.120> vacuum<00:04:26.690> will<00:04:26.840> be<00:04:26.990> created<00:04:27.530> here

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
instead a vacuum will be created here

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.610 
instead a vacuum will be created here
and<00:04:28.270> it'll<00:04:29.270> split<00:04:29.630> to<00:04:29.780> the<00:04:29.810> two<00:04:30.050> pipes<00:04:30.320> and

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
and it'll split to the two pipes and

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.899 
and it'll split to the two pipes and
come<00:04:31.550> down<00:04:31.760> here

00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:32.909 
come down here

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:35.909 
come down here
into<00:04:33.909> the<00:04:34.030> air<00:04:34.180> intake<00:04:34.210> plenum<00:04:34.870> box<00:04:35.349> from<00:04:35.860> the

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
into the air intake plenum box from the

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:38.850 
into the air intake plenum box from the
air<00:04:36.129> filter<00:04:36.430> so<00:04:36.939> what<00:04:37.150> happens<00:04:37.509> is<00:04:37.719> is<00:04:37.990> the

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
air filter so what happens is is the

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.629 
air filter so what happens is is the
valve<00:04:39.330> which<00:04:40.330> is<00:04:40.479> located<00:04:40.689> here<00:04:41.409> and<00:04:41.639> the

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:42.639 
valve which is located here and the

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.200 
valve which is located here and the
other<00:04:42.789> valve<00:04:43.150> which<00:04:43.569> is<00:04:43.749> located<00:04:43.990> over<00:04:44.830> there

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
other valve which is located over there

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.679 
other valve which is located over there
that<00:04:46.210> valve<00:04:46.599> will<00:04:46.960> then<00:04:47.259> closed<00:04:47.919> off<00:04:48.279> and<00:04:48.689> this

00:04:49.679 --> 00:04:49.689 
that valve will then closed off and this

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:53.100 
that valve will then closed off and this
valve<00:04:50.080> will<00:04:50.560> open<00:04:50.590> up<00:04:51.099> the<00:04:51.879> sucking<00:04:52.449> the

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
valve will open up the sucking the

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:58.409 
valve will open up the sucking the
hydrogen<00:04:53.620> oxygen<00:04:53.979> mix<00:04:54.430> this<00:04:55.330> way<00:04:56.639> into<00:04:57.639> the

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
hydrogen oxygen mix this way into the

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:03.059 
hydrogen oxygen mix this way into the
air<00:04:58.629> filter<00:04:58.960> plenum<00:04:59.560> box<00:04:59.849> right<00:05:00.849> here<00:05:02.069> which

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:03.069 
air filter plenum box right here which

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:04.379 
air filter plenum box right here which
is<00:05:03.249> what<00:05:03.550> you're<00:05:03.699> looking<00:05:03.729> at<00:05:04.090> right<00:05:04.150> there

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:04.389 
is what you're looking at right there

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:07.170 
is what you're looking at right there
now<00:05:05.289> here's<00:05:05.529> the<00:05:05.680> gauge<00:05:05.860> right<00:05:06.129> now<00:05:06.370> it<00:05:06.699> sits

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
now here's the gauge right now it sits

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.559 
now here's the gauge right now it sits
at<00:05:07.590> zero<00:05:08.590> on<00:05:08.889> the<00:05:09.669> vacuum<00:05:09.819> let's<00:05:10.270> see<00:05:10.389> if<00:05:10.449> we

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:10.569 
at zero on the vacuum let's see if we

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:13.469 
at zero on the vacuum let's see if we
can<00:05:10.719> zoom<00:05:11.020> in<00:05:11.580> see<00:05:12.580> if<00:05:12.639> it'll<00:05:12.789> focus<00:05:12.969> is<00:05:13.330> at

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
can zoom in see if it'll focus is at

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:15.719 
can zoom in see if it'll focus is at
zero<00:05:13.840> now<00:05:14.680> what<00:05:14.830> I'm<00:05:14.949> going<00:05:15.039> to<00:05:15.099> do<00:05:15.279> is<00:05:15.580> I'm

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:15.729 
zero now what I'm going to do is I'm

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:17.730 
zero now what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:05:15.909> to<00:05:16.000> starting<00:05:16.539> engine<00:05:16.840> up<00:05:16.990> and<00:05:17.229> you'll

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
going to starting engine up and you'll

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.860 
going to starting engine up and you'll
be<00:05:17.860> able<00:05:18.009> to<00:05:18.159> see<00:05:18.430> where<00:05:18.669> it<00:05:18.759> sits<00:05:19.000> at<00:05:19.300> an<00:05:19.539> idol

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
be able to see where it sits at an idol

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.469 
be able to see where it sits at an idol
so<00:05:20.620> just<00:05:20.889> hold<00:05:21.009> on<00:05:21.279> and<00:05:21.580> I'm<00:05:22.029> gonna<00:05:22.120> stop<00:05:22.330> the

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479 
so just hold on and I'm gonna stop the

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:24.659 
so just hold on and I'm gonna stop the
camera<00:05:22.779> second<00:05:23.169> and<00:05:23.289> start<00:05:23.680> the<00:05:23.800> truck<00:05:24.009> hold

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:24.669 
camera second and start the truck hold

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:33.480 
camera second and start the truck hold
on

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490
