to show everyone how it works
there<00:04:34.099> we<00:04:34.250> go<00:04:34.840> so<00:04:35.840> if<00:04:36.169> you<00:04:36.320> move<00:04:36.500> the<00:04:36.650> conveyor

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979 
there we go so if you move the conveyor

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.909 
there we go so if you move the conveyor
belt<00:04:37.099> the<00:04:37.520> rocks<00:04:38.030> kind<00:04:38.780> of<00:04:38.990> jiggle<00:04:39.440> up<00:04:39.680> and

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
belt the rocks kind of jiggle up and

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.060 
belt the rocks kind of jiggle up and
down<00:04:40.509> it<00:04:41.509> doesn't<00:04:41.810> work<00:04:42.020> if<00:04:42.169> you<00:04:42.289> roll<00:04:42.530> it<00:04:42.740> but

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
down it doesn't work if you roll it but

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.510 
down it doesn't work if you roll it but
so<00:04:43.880> it<00:04:44.000> gives<00:04:44.180> that<00:04:44.330> effect<00:04:44.630> that<00:04:45.080> it<00:04:45.470> is<00:04:45.770> doing

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520
