00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.949 

okay<00:00:02.010> here's<00:00:02.340> what<00:00:02.580> to<00:00:02.730> do<00:00:02.850> if<00:00:03.000> your<00:00:03.240> hoses

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
okay here's what to do if your hoses

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.050 
okay here's what to do if your hoses
your<00:00:04.230> radiator<00:00:04.650> hoses<00:00:04.950> are<00:00:05.310> imploding<00:00:05.940> on

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
your radiator hoses are imploding on

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.220 
your radiator hoses are imploding on
themselves<00:00:06.480> so<00:00:07.189> you<00:00:08.189> can<00:00:08.340> see<00:00:08.639> this<00:00:08.820> here<00:00:10.010> the

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.230 
themselves so you can see this here the

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.690 
themselves so you can see this here the
hose<00:00:13.230> basically<00:00:13.830> just<00:00:14.040> implodes<00:00:14.460> on<00:00:14.639> itself

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
hose basically just implodes on itself

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.150 
hose basically just implodes on itself
and<00:00:16.640> kind<00:00:17.640> of<00:00:17.699> like<00:00:17.940> sucks<00:00:18.359> in<00:00:19.070> indication<00:00:20.070> of

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
and kind of like sucks in indication of

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.519 
and kind of like sucks in indication of
suction<00:00:20.609> I<00:00:20.930> don't<00:00:21.930> know<00:00:22.020> if<00:00:22.080> you<00:00:22.170> can<00:00:22.289> tell<00:00:22.500> but

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
suction I don't know if you can tell but

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.590 
suction I don't know if you can tell but
that<00:00:22.740> bottom<00:00:23.279> radiator<00:00:23.760> hose<00:00:24.000> is<00:00:24.269> doing<00:00:24.510> the

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
that bottom radiator hose is doing the

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.970 
that bottom radiator hose is doing the
same<00:00:24.840> thing<00:00:24.900> down<00:00:25.560> there<00:00:25.859> at<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.070> very<00:00:26.310> bottom

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
same thing down there at the very bottom

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.609 
same thing down there at the very bottom
these<00:00:28.980> are<00:00:29.130> brand<00:00:29.400> new<00:00:29.519> hoses<00:00:30.230> but<00:00:31.230> that's<00:00:31.500> the

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
these are brand new hoses but that's the

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.200 
these are brand new hoses but that's the
first<00:00:31.859> thing<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.189> want<00:00:32.369> check<00:00:32.610> if<00:00:32.850> your<00:00:33.000> hoses

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
first thing you want check if your hoses

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.360 
first thing you want check if your hoses
are<00:00:33.570> old<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:34.079> probably<00:00:34.980> need<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.219> replace

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
are old you probably need to replace

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.030 
are old you probably need to replace
them<00:00:35.850> it's<00:00:36.840> good<00:00:37.020> idea<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.410> do<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.710> coolant

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
them it's good idea to do the coolant

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.490 
them it's good idea to do the coolant
flush<00:00:38.309> on<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:39.719> can<00:00:39.870> find<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.200> in<00:00:40.350> my

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
flush on it you can find that in my

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.029 
flush on it you can find that in my
other<00:00:40.980> videos<00:00:42.950> but<00:00:43.950> more<00:00:44.520> often<00:00:44.850> than<00:00:45.000> not

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
other videos but more often than not

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:48.560 
other videos but more often than not
you'll<00:00:47.039> also<00:00:47.219> want<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.640> check<00:00:47.969> your<00:00:48.149> overflow

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
you'll also want to check your overflow

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.889 
you'll also want to check your overflow
tank<00:00:48.840> here<00:00:49.230> which<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:50.100> hose<00:00:50.309> unit<00:00:50.700> runs<00:00:50.940> from

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
tank here which the hose unit runs from

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.319 
tank here which the hose unit runs from
the<00:00:52.050> radiator<00:00:52.469> into<00:00:53.100> there<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:54.030> want<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.210> make

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
the radiator into there you want to make

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.270 
the radiator into there you want to make
sure<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.570> your<00:00:54.750> hose<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.410> connects<00:00:56.100> the

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
sure that your hose that connects the

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.520 
sure that your hose that connects the
overflow<00:00:56.610> tank<00:00:56.879> to<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.480> radiator<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.230> not

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
overflow tank to the radiator is not

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.060 
overflow tank to the radiator is not
blocked<00:00:58.890> but<00:00:59.520> that<00:00:59.760> would<00:00:59.910> be<00:00:59.940> pretty<00:01:00.059> rare

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
blocked but that would be pretty rare

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.529 
blocked but that would be pretty rare
and<00:01:02.070> then<00:01:02.219> check<00:01:02.460> your<00:01:02.489> overflow<00:01:02.969> tank<00:01:03.239> make

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
and then check your overflow tank make

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.149 
and then check your overflow tank make
sure<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.780> doesn't<00:01:04.019> have<00:01:04.140> too<00:01:04.170> much<00:01:04.530> coolant<00:01:05.040> in

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
sure it doesn't have too much coolant in

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.250 
sure it doesn't have too much coolant in
it<00:01:05.280> as<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:06.150> correct<00:01:06.420> amount<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.810> coolant<00:01:07.140> in

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
it as the correct amount of coolant in

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.640 
it as the correct amount of coolant in
it<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:08.570> but<00:01:09.570> then<00:01:09.780> you'll<00:01:10.020> you'll<00:01:10.320> inevitably

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
it and but then you'll you'll inevitably

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.620 
it and but then you'll you'll inevitably
probably<00:01:11.369> wind<00:01:11.520> up<00:01:11.640> having<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:12.030> replace<00:01:12.270> your

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
probably wind up having to replace your

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.820 
probably wind up having to replace your
radiator<00:01:13.200> cap<00:01:14.570> reason<00:01:15.570> being<00:01:15.810> is<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.710> can

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
radiator cap reason being is and you can

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.440 
radiator cap reason being is and you can
see<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.220> actually<00:01:17.729> suck<00:01:18.000> out<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.360> will

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
see this actually suck out it will

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.630 
see this actually suck out it will
release<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.900> suction<00:01:19.170> when<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.590> remove<00:01:20.460> the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
release the suction when I remove the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:29.420 
release the suction when I remove the
cap<00:01:20.820> here<00:01:24.170> there<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.380> goes<00:01:26.540> um<00:01:28.220> reason<00:01:29.220> being

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
cap here there it goes um reason being

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.280 
cap here there it goes um reason being
is<00:01:29.670> these<00:01:29.909> caps<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.509> know<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.840> they<00:01:31.049> need<00:01:31.170> to

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
is these caps you know that they need to

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.380 
is these caps you know that they need to
be<00:01:31.380> replaced<00:01:31.680> every<00:01:31.860> couple<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.340> years<00:01:32.400> you

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
be replaced every couple of years you

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.140 
be replaced every couple of years you
know<00:01:33.479> two<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.720> five<00:01:33.990> years<00:01:34.460> basically<00:01:35.460> this

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
know two to five years basically this

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.719 
know two to five years basically this
spring<00:01:36.840> in<00:01:37.020> here<00:01:37.320> can<00:01:37.650> get<00:01:37.829> funky<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.460> seal

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
spring in here can get funky the seal

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.370 
spring in here can get funky the seal
can<00:01:39.000> get<00:01:39.119> funky<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:40.189> cause<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.400> not<00:01:41.579> to

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
can get funky and cause it not to

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.350 
can get funky and cause it not to
release<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.590> pressure<00:01:43.799> from<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.820> radiator

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
release the pressure from the radiator

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.130 
release the pressure from the radiator
back<00:01:45.720> into<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.140> upper<00:01:46.290> flow<00:01:46.530> tank<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:48.140> that's

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
back into the upper flow tank and that's

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.340 
back into the upper flow tank and that's
what<00:01:49.350> causes<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.829> suction<00:01:50.460> issue<00:01:50.610> so<00:01:51.479> you'll

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
what causes the suction issue so you'll

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.219 
what causes the suction issue so you'll
probably<00:01:52.560> need<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.950> get<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.310> new<00:01:53.759> new<00:01:54.750> radiator

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
probably need to get a new new radiator

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.380 
probably need to get a new new radiator
