00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
technique to take care of these sort of

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:46.950 
technique to take care of these sort of
things<00:01:45.159> in<00:01:45.430> this<00:01:45.909> clip<00:01:46.119> we<00:01:46.329> do<00:01:46.479> well<00:01:46.630> to<00:01:46.659> slow

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
things in this clip we do well to slow

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.200 
things in this clip we do well to slow
the<00:01:47.110> first<00:01:47.320> posession<00:01:47.829> down<00:01:47.860> and<00:01:48.340> then<00:01:49.060> move

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
the first posession down and then move

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.940 
the first posession down and then move
the<00:01:49.390> ball<00:01:49.570> out<00:01:49.689> the<00:01:49.869> back<00:01:50.110> if<00:01:50.409> anything<00:01:50.860> we

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
the ball out the back if anything we

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.289 
the ball out the back if anything we
probably<00:01:51.189> get<00:01:51.399> a<00:01:51.460> little<00:01:51.549> bit<00:01:51.700> tight<00:01:52.030> and

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
probably get a little bit tight and

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:54.480 
probably get a little bit tight and
which<00:01:53.170> puts<00:01:53.409> pressure<00:01:53.500> on<00:01:53.860> the<00:01:53.920> guys<00:01:54.159> on<00:01:54.369> the

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
which puts pressure on the guys on the

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.969 
which puts pressure on the guys on the
outside<00:01:54.990> ideally<00:01:55.990> we<00:01:56.079> want<00:01:56.200> to<00:01:56.320> guys<00:01:56.680> hitting

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
outside ideally we want to guys hitting

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.100 
outside ideally we want to guys hitting
every<00:01:57.340> ball<00:01:57.549> carrier<00:01:57.939> that<00:01:58.060> they<00:01:58.210> have<00:01:58.420> he

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
every ball carrier that they have he

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.080 
every ball carrier that they have he
gets<00:01:59.350> on<00:01:59.500> the<00:01:59.530> outside<00:02:00.040> and<00:02:00.280> he<00:02:00.729> does<00:02:00.880> a<00:02:00.909> good

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
gets on the outside and he does a good

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.940 
gets on the outside and he does a good
job<00:02:01.149> to<00:02:01.390> finish<00:02:01.780> this<00:02:01.960> that's<00:02:02.530> all<00:02:02.619> very<00:02:02.799> well

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
job to finish this that's all very well

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.130 
job to finish this that's all very well

man<00:02:05.320> you<00:02:05.469> have<00:02:05.590> to<00:02:05.619> set<00:02:05.860> to<00:02:06.070> on<00:02:06.219> I<00:02:06.430> think

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
man you have to set to on I think

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.280 
man you have to set to on I think
ideally<00:02:06.969> every<00:02:07.329> time<00:02:07.540> a<00:02:07.570> guy<00:02:07.780> carries<00:02:08.170> you

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.290 
ideally every time a guy carries you

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.770 
ideally every time a guy carries you
want<00:02:08.470> those<00:02:08.649> two<00:02:08.890> defenders<00:02:09.340> in<00:02:09.459> there<00:02:09.780> but

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
want those two defenders in there but

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.449 
want those two defenders in there but
pick<00:02:10.989> em<00:02:11.140> all<00:02:11.260> is<00:02:11.380> obviously<00:02:11.709> very<00:02:11.980> strong<00:02:12.310> up

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
pick em all is obviously very strong up

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.789 
pick em all is obviously very strong up
top<00:02:12.670> and<00:02:12.940> in<00:02:13.060> the<00:02:13.090> leg<00:02:13.329> so<00:02:13.630> he<00:02:14.140> is<00:02:14.230> a<00:02:14.260> guy<00:02:14.530> that

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
top and in the leg so he is a guy that

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:16.410 
top and in the leg so he is a guy that
even<00:02:15.099> when<00:02:15.250> you<00:02:15.340> hit<00:02:15.459> to<00:02:15.580> me<00:02:15.730> can<00:02:16.000> get<00:02:16.209> that

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
even when you hit to me can get that

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.420 
even when you hit to me can get that
extra<00:02:16.660> bit<00:02:16.870> of<00:02:16.989> leg<00:02:17.140> drive<00:02:17.379> which<00:02:18.010> enables

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
extra bit of leg drive which enables

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.680 
extra bit of leg drive which enables
them<00:02:18.550> to<00:02:18.610> get<00:02:18.760> offered<00:02:19.090> so<00:02:19.270> it<00:02:19.360> can<00:02:19.510> be

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
them to get offered so it can be

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.240 
them to get offered so it can be
dangerous<00:02:20.080> you<00:02:20.230> can<00:02:20.320> keep<00:02:20.470> for<00:02:20.650> father<00:02:20.830> quiet

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
dangerous you can keep for father quiet

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.370 
dangerous you can keep for father quiet
and<00:02:21.370> you<00:02:21.430> keep<00:02:21.610> picking<00:02:21.790> on<00:02:21.970> quiet<00:02:22.270> how<00:02:23.170> high

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
and you keep picking on quiet how high

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.900 
and you keep picking on quiet how high
the<00:02:23.440> confidence<00:02:23.950> level<00:02:24.070> so<00:02:24.310> this<00:02:24.430> weekend<00:02:24.760> I

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
the confidence level so this weekend I

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.450 
the confidence level so this weekend I
think<00:02:25.150> going<00:02:25.300> to<00:02:25.360> be<00:02:25.450> careful<00:02:25.870> because<00:02:25.990> is<00:02:26.620> a

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
think going to be careful because is a

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.850 
think going to be careful because is a
13<00:02:28.420> other<00:02:28.600> players<00:02:28.930> that<00:02:29.440> we<00:02:29.560> haven't<00:02:29.740> looked

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
13 other players that we haven't looked

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.520 
13 other players that we haven't looked
at<00:02:30.240> though<00:02:31.240> good<00:02:31.510> team<00:02:31.750> and<00:02:31.960> likely<00:02:32.170> say<00:02:32.350> it's

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
at though good team and likely say it's

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.960 
at though good team and likely say it's
the<00:02:32.650> only<00:02:32.770> exchange<00:02:33.250> that<00:02:33.490> were<00:02:33.610> going<00:02:33.760> to<00:02:33.850> be

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
the only exchange that were going to be

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.300 
the only exchange that were going to be
concerned<00:02:34.660> about<00:02:34.840> so<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.620> big<00:02:35.800> the<00:02:36.280> big

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
honestly there is no load to it

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.320 
honestly there is no load to it
obviously<00:03:00.400> I<00:03:00.520> didn't<00:03:00.670> even<00:03:00.820> get<00:03:00.940> to<00:03:01.060> watch<00:03:01.150> the

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
obviously I didn't even get to watch the

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.610 
obviously I didn't even get to watch the
game<00:03:01.360> start<00:03:01.780> to<00:03:01.840> refund<00:03:02.110> them<00:03:02.200> a<00:03:02.260> ticket<00:03:02.560> and

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
game start to refund them a ticket and

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.350 
game start to refund them a ticket and
everything<00:03:02.710> so<00:03:03.130> there's<00:03:03.760> a<00:03:03.820> bit<00:03:03.970> of<00:03:04.000> not<00:03:04.210> know

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
everything so there's a bit of not know

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.070 
everything so there's a bit of not know
a<00:03:05.320> few<00:03:06.040> streak<00:03:06.340> is<00:03:06.550> one<00:03:07.240> I<00:03:07.570> think<00:03:07.720> must<00:03:07.990> have

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
a few streak is one I think must have

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.380 
a few streak is one I think must have
done<00:03:08.200> the<00:03:08.290> length<00:03:08.500> out<00:03:08.950> right<00:03:09.250> every<00:03:09.640> security
