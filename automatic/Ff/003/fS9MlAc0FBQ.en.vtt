00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.560 
and the thumb you play the same note so
you'll<00:02:07.310> start<00:02:07.490> with<00:02:07.700> C<00:02:09.430> and<00:02:10.430> then<00:02:11.240> it<00:02:11.330> goes<00:02:11.450> up

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
you'll start with C and then it goes up

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.750 
you'll start with C and then it goes up
to<00:02:11.690> a<00:02:11.810> flat<00:02:12.790> here

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.850 

F<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:19.130> then<00:02:20.130> F<00:02:20.280> sharp

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.009 

and<00:02:22.980> then<00:02:23.820> back<00:02:24.060> down<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.420> ass

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:40.480 

so<00:02:30.019> which<00:02:30.140> is<00:02:30.290> sound<00:02:30.469> like<00:02:30.590> this

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:54.320 

okay<00:02:41.490> so<00:02:42.390> so<00:02:42.540> far<00:02:42.750> we've<00:02:42.930> learned<00:02:51.770> right<00:02:53.330> again

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
okay so so far we've learned right again

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:06.380 
okay so so far we've learned right again
Nance<00:03:03.980> and<00:03:04.980> then<00:03:05.610> when<00:03:05.700> you<00:03:05.790> drop<00:03:06.000> back<00:03:06.209> down

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
Nance and then when you drop back down

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.410 
Nance and then when you drop back down
to<00:03:06.570> F<00:03:07.040> go<00:03:08.040> back<00:03:08.220> and<00:03:08.430> forth<00:03:08.670> with<00:03:08.760> G<00:03:09.090> and<00:03:09.270> half

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
to F go back and forth with G and half

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.259 
to F go back and forth with G and half
right<00:03:09.630> here

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:33.220 

the

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.709 

okay<00:03:34.549> and<00:03:35.549> then<00:03:35.730> with<00:03:35.909> the<00:03:36.000> right<00:03:36.150> hand<00:03:36.510> the

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:36.719 
okay and then with the right hand the

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:43.910 
okay and then with the right hand the
second<00:03:37.109> part<00:03:37.319> goes<00:03:38.099> off<00:03:38.489> a<00:03:39.349> flat<00:03:40.400> and<00:03:41.400> B<00:03:42.920> that

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
second part goes off a flat and B that

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.360 
second part goes off a flat and B that
happens<00:03:44.340> twice<00:03:45.650> and<00:03:46.650> then<00:03:46.799> each<00:03:46.980> don't<00:03:47.250> by

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
happens twice and then each don't by

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:53.209 
happens twice and then each don't by
itself<00:03:48.049> and<00:03:49.189> then<00:03:50.189> it<00:03:50.310> drops<00:03:50.519> down<00:03:50.670> to<00:03:50.849> e<00:03:51.859> G<00:03:52.859> and

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:53.219 
itself and then it drops down to e G and

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:56.809 
itself and then it drops down to e G and
B<00:03:53.420> flat<00:03:54.799> twice<00:03:55.799> and<00:03:56.129> then<00:03:56.219> each<00:03:56.400> don't<00:03:56.670> by

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
B flat twice and then each don't by

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:03.679 
B flat twice and then each don't by
itself<00:03:59.269> and<00:04:00.560> then<00:04:01.560> just<00:04:01.859> to<00:04:02.040> chord<00:04:02.370> F<00:04:02.689> major

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:03.689 
itself and then just to chord F major

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:12.649 
itself and then just to chord F major
which<00:04:04.379> is<00:04:04.409> not<00:04:04.739> a<00:04:05.129> and<00:04:05.909> C<00:04:06.689> okay<00:04:10.069> so<00:04:11.569> it's<00:04:12.569> just

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:12.659 
which is not a and C okay so it's just

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:20.870 
which is not a and C okay so it's just
sound<00:04:12.840> like<00:04:12.959> this

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.780 

and<00:04:22.320> with<00:04:23.320> the<00:04:23.410> left<00:04:23.620> hand<00:04:23.860> you<00:04:24.490> do<00:04:24.670> see<00:04:25.060> sharp

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
and with the left hand you do see sharp

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.630 
and with the left hand you do see sharp

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
with the pink in thumb like before and

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:36.180 
with the pink in thumb like before and
then<00:04:30.760> it<00:04:30.850> drops<00:04:31.060> down<00:04:31.270> to<00:04:31.330> see<00:04:33.330> hawaii's<00:04:35.190> and

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
then it drops down to see hawaii's and

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.530 
then it drops down to see hawaii's and
then<00:04:37.260> twice<00:04:38.430> and<00:04:39.430> then<00:04:39.550> you<00:04:39.760> lose<00:04:39.910> your<00:04:40.120> pinkie

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:52.970 
do it but that's how you play the second
part<00:05:35.350> and<00:05:35.710> so<00:05:36.220> far<00:05:36.460> we've<00:05:36.640> learned<00:05:36.880> this

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:52.980 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.220 

that's<00:05:53.580> the<00:05:53.760> intro

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:55.230 
that's the intro

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.679 
that's the intro
and<00:05:55.830> you<00:05:55.950> repeat<00:05:56.310> them

00:05:57.679 --> 00:05:57.689 
and you repeat them

00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:35.600 
and you repeat them
what<00:05:58.379> you<00:05:58.679> did<00:05:58.949> to<00:05:59.249> me<00:05:59.489> made<00:06:00.119> me<00:06:00.689> see<00:06:01.289> myself

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:35.610 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:54.860 

goes<00:06:36.210> back<00:06:36.389> to<00:06:36.539> the<00:06:36.629> beginning

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:54.870 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:58.010 

the<00:06:55.260> second<00:06:55.620> part<00:06:56.280> it<00:06:56.580> took<00:06:56.850> me<00:06:57.210> such<00:06:57.480> a<00:06:57.510> long

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.020 
the second part it took me such a long

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:13.350 
the second part it took me such a long
time<00:06:58.740> to<00:06:59.100> get<00:06:59.310> back<00:06:59.580> home<00:07:00.080> first<00:07:01.080> time
