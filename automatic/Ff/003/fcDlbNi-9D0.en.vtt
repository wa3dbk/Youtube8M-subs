00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:24.910 
good option so to start I'm going to

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.770 
good option so to start I'm going to
peel<00:01:25.090> back<00:01:25.270> the<00:01:25.480> plastic<00:01:25.690> cover<00:01:27.780> being

quite<00:01:32.080> yet<00:01:32.290> I'm<00:01:33.160> going<00:01:33.280> to<00:01:33.370> set<00:01:33.550> some<00:01:33.730> weights

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
quite yet I'm going to set some weights

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.540 
quite yet I'm going to set some weights
down<00:01:34.270> so<00:01:35.110> that<00:01:35.350> the<00:01:35.740> page<00:01:36.010> isn't<00:01:36.250> going<00:01:36.490> to

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
down so that the page isn't going to

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.670 
down so that the page isn't going to
slide<00:01:36.760> around<00:01:36.790> on<00:01:37.330> me<00:01:37.540> while<00:01:37.960> I'm<00:01:38.080> trying<00:01:38.290> this

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
slide around on me while I'm trying this

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.620 
slide around on me while I'm trying this
and<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:40.930> usually<00:01:41.560> start<00:01:41.950> with<00:01:42.250> what<00:01:43.120> we<00:01:43.420> call<00:01:43.600> a

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
and I usually start with what we call a

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.540 
and I usually start with what we call a
microspatula<00:01:44.110> which<00:01:44.710> is<00:01:44.860> much<00:01:45.130> much<00:01:45.490> smaller

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
microspatula which is much much smaller

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.450 
microspatula which is much much smaller
and<00:01:46.270> thinner<00:01:46.450> than<00:01:46.600> the<00:01:46.960> kind<00:01:47.200> of<00:01:47.530> object<00:01:48.370> that

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
and thinner than the kind of object that

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.750 
and thinner than the kind of object that
you<00:01:48.580> have<00:01:48.610> in<00:01:49.120> your<00:01:49.270> kitchen<00:01:49.510> and<00:01:50.340> if<00:01:51.340> I<00:01:51.460> can't

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
you have in your kitchen and if I can't

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.050 
you have in your kitchen and if I can't
get<00:01:52.150> under<00:01:52.420> the<00:01:53.230> image<00:01:53.590> easily<00:01:54.370> with<00:01:54.640> my<00:01:54.670> micro

I<00:01:55.780> will<00:01:56.680> switch<00:01:57.010> to<00:01:57.720> a<00:01:58.720> piece<00:01:59.080> of<00:01:59.260> mylar<00:01:59.650> this

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
I will switch to a piece of mylar this

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.340 
I will switch to a piece of mylar this
is<00:02:00.190> a<00:02:00.220> polyester<00:02:00.730> film<00:02:01.210> that's<00:02:01.630> relatively

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
is a polyester film that's relatively

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.730 
is a polyester film that's relatively

thin but it's also quite sharp on the
edges<00:02:05.890> and<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:08.099> will<00:02:09.099> start<00:02:09.869> going<00:02:10.869> under

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
edges and I will start going under

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.970 
edges and I will start going under
but<00:02:12.840> at<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:12.989> moment<00:02:13.140> I<00:02:13.439> seem<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.739> be<00:02:13.829> having

stay away from flavors and heavily waxed
flosses<00:02:33.569> and<00:02:35.870> you<00:02:36.870> just<00:02:37.079> sort<00:02:37.260> of<00:02:37.409> feed<00:02:38.159> it

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310

under<00:02:38.639> and<00:02:38.849> I<00:02:38.909> can<00:02:39.060> see<00:02:39.239> that<00:02:39.420> this<00:02:39.540> edge<00:02:39.750> is

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
under and I can see that this edge is

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.509 
under and I can see that this edge is
starting<00:02:40.349> the<00:02:40.439> lift<00:02:40.680> so<00:02:41.010> I'm<00:02:41.099> going<00:02:41.219> to<00:02:41.280> go<00:02:41.370> the

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
starting the lift so I'm going to go the

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:46.099 
starting the lift so I'm going to go the
easy<00:02:41.730> way<00:02:42.030> and<00:02:43.099> just<00:02:44.269> pull<00:02:45.269> side<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:45.689> side<00:02:45.870> the

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
easy way and just pull side to side the

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:47.659 
easy way and just pull side to side the
same<00:02:46.260> way<00:02:46.439> that<00:02:46.590> you<00:02:46.739> brush<00:02:47.010> your<00:02:47.159> teeth<00:02:47.220> and

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
don't lift up on the image because if

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.020 
don't lift up on the image because if
your<00:02:53.239> image<00:02:54.239> is<00:02:54.269> really<00:02:54.689> brittle<00:02:55.879> lifting<00:02:56.879> up

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
your image is really brittle lifting up

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.530 
your image is really brittle lifting up
in<00:02:57.419> any<00:02:57.750> will<00:02:58.079> crack<00:02:58.469> the<00:02:58.709> photo<00:02:58.950> and<00:02:59.540> I'm

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
in any will crack the photo and I'm

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.119 
in any will crack the photo and I'm
moving<00:03:00.959> the<00:03:01.079> weights<00:03:01.290> to<00:03:01.500> get<00:03:01.709> them<00:03:01.889> out<00:03:02.069> of

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
moving the weights to get them out of

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:05.920 
moving the weights to get them out of
the<00:03:02.609> way<00:03:02.760> of<00:03:02.790> where<00:03:03.180> my<00:03:03.329> hands<00:03:03.629> need<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:03.930> be

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
the way of where my hands need to be

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.429 
the way of where my hands need to be
just<00:03:06.930> slowly<00:03:07.340> working<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.549> floss<00:03:09.319> and<00:03:10.319> it

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:10.439 
just slowly working the floss and it

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:12.199 
just slowly working the floss and it
seems<00:03:10.680> like<00:03:10.859> the<00:03:11.010> top<00:03:11.250> here<00:03:11.549> is<00:03:11.639> a<00:03:11.669> little<00:03:11.969> more

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
seems like the top here is a little more

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.089 
seems like the top here is a little more
stuck<00:03:13.340> so<00:03:14.340> remove<00:03:14.969> this<00:03:15.209> again<00:03:15.949> you<00:03:16.949> don't

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
stuck so remove this again you don't

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.009 
stuck so remove this again you don't
want<00:03:17.220> to<00:03:17.280> pull<00:03:17.489> or<00:03:17.729> force<00:03:18.000> it<00:03:18.239> if<00:03:18.840> you're

having trouble going in one direction

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.520 
having trouble going in one direction
you<00:03:20.579> can<00:03:21.000> try<00:03:21.930> going<00:03:22.139> in<00:03:22.319> a<00:03:22.409> different
