00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello to all of you guys 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.210
 rejection of minecraft position today in 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.280
 this new video as telethon from 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.309
 title today I have to see the news of the 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.170
 fab bild 11 mt this part already from a 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.179
 nice bit of days and then continued 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.949
 we will see the news that 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.020
 have added in this new version 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.300
 the first news added this version 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.420
 it is precisely that which we otherwise go to 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.050
 flight with the creative and we go out in the menu 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.359
 main 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.980
 when we think we will remain in that world 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.019
 the pad will remain 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.730
 we say open and already selected for 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.680
 be able to go back down again I know if I do 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.600
 I am well explained it is something that it is 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.219
 been settled that should be a 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.260
 little bug which is now much much more 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.879
 comfortable to use in creative 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.500
 another tip of this cast is one 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.539
 version is the one that the book 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.370
 the enchantment of the football movie is now 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.469
 burnett and the less creative is one thing 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.180
 which is finally missing, too 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.059
 another thing that has been improved 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.820
 precisely what is now the excellent the ball 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.859
 it can finally happen in the counter 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.109
 from work or weak crafting 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.140
 facts before this shadmi te vol 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.030
 it could only be noticed in the vast one 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.920
 cutter having a size that enters then 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.130
 Do you remember that many of you do not 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.350
 they could cross launched mind vol 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.360
 because they didn't know that they didn't 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.610
 he still treated the wolfman in society 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.869
 the stone crafter so small thing 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.369
 modified 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.140
 another has been modified point which 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.450
 when you were chips in the past 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.700
 bild did not allow to place i 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.500
 blocks below you heritage and now it is 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.280
 possible so I'm modified this 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.259
 stuff 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.939
 another thing I noticed right point 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.829
 that when we put the shift you see it 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.259
 as if the reds lowered the character 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.780
 but as you or civil has issued, that is 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.060
 we produce not animate them that yes 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.430
 however some secure squats were 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.079
 of the novelties of this new build 11 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.299
 however those furrows an exclusion vi 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.310
 I leave the link to the complete changelog 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.110
 with all the news the bugs solved 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.810
 however sorry if in this period 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.119
 AirOps Ottati many wherever 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.990
 they will be less and less frequently but there 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.060
 will always be 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.259
 I hope he is the institute there 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.259
