hand okay so now you've seen what it

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.069 
hand okay so now you've seen what it
looks<00:00:32.730> like<00:00:33.000> I'm<00:00:33.270> guessing<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:33.690> wanna<00:00:33.899> know

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
looks like I'm guessing you wanna know

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.959 
looks like I'm guessing you wanna know
how<00:00:34.260> it's<00:00:34.440> done<00:00:34.590> now<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.250> know<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.790> wasn't

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
how it's done now I know that wasn't

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.340 
how it's done now I know that wasn't
very<00:00:36.090> impressive<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.870> was<00:00:36.960> only<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.200> small

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
very impressive it was only a small

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.799 
very impressive it was only a small
distance<00:00:37.890> but<00:00:38.190> my<00:00:38.730> camera<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.329> won't<00:00:39.629> be<00:00:39.719> able

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
distance but my camera you won't be able

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.740 
distance but my camera you won't be able
to<00:00:39.989> see<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:40.320> if<00:00:40.410> I<00:00:40.500> do<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.739> too<00:00:40.890> far<00:00:41.100> away

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
to see it if I do it too far away

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.690 
to see it if I do it too far away
so<00:00:42.750> obviously<00:00:43.170> it's<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.920> can<00:00:44.129> do<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.520> lot

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
so obviously it's you can do it a lot

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.310 
so obviously it's you can do it a lot
further<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.360> don't<00:00:45.629> know<00:00:45.719> if<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:45.870> can<00:00:45.989> see<00:00:46.170> this

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
further I don't know if you can see this

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.189 
further I don't know if you can see this
though<00:00:48.440> but<00:00:49.440> um<00:00:50.449> this<00:00:51.449> trick<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:52.020> really

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
though but um this trick is really

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.549 
though but um this trick is really
difficult<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:53.699> will<00:00:53.850> take<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.510> couple<00:00:54.600> of

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
difficult it will take you a couple of

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.619 
difficult it will take you a couple of
weeks<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:56.039> learn<00:00:56.190> this<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.730> really<00:00:56.760> hot<00:00:57.239> and

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
weeks to learn this it is really hot and

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.470 
weeks to learn this it is really hot and
actually<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.620> does<00:00:58.829> hurt<00:00:59.149> don't<00:01:00.149> know<00:01:00.300> if<00:01:00.390> you

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
actually it does hurt don't know if you

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.660 
actually it does hurt don't know if you
can<00:01:00.629> see<00:01:00.870> this<00:01:01.109> I<00:01:01.350> haven't<00:01:01.649> been<00:01:01.800> doing<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.219> too

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
can see this I haven't been doing it too

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.270 
can see this I haven't been doing it too
much<00:01:02.969> recently<00:01:03.390> but<00:01:03.870> there's<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.500> big<00:01:04.710> red<00:01:04.979> mark

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
much recently but there's a big red mark

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.200 
much recently but there's a big red mark
here<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.790> here<00:01:06.270> with<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.450> coin<00:01:08.119> Robinson<00:01:09.119> it

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
here and here with a coin Robinson it

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.450 
here and here with a coin Robinson it
hurts<00:01:09.420> it's<00:01:10.170> best<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.530> do<00:01:10.710> this<00:01:10.860> trick<00:01:11.130> with<00:01:11.310> a

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
hurts it's best to do this trick with a

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.000 
hurts it's best to do this trick with a
smooth<00:01:11.909> rounded<00:01:12.479> coin<00:01:12.750> but<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.439> needs<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.830> be

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
smooth rounded coin but it needs to be

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.420 
smooth rounded coin but it needs to be
big<00:01:14.310> um<00:01:15.119> it's<00:01:15.930> very<00:01:16.049> very<00:01:16.740> difficult<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.280> do

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
big um it's very very difficult to do

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.480 
big um it's very very difficult to do
with<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.670> small<00:01:18.030> coin<00:01:18.299> um<00:01:19.170> so<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:19.890> mean<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.340> best

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
with a small coin um so I mean the best

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.510 
with a small coin um so I mean the best
thing<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.759> do<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.320> probably<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.619> poker<00:01:22.890> chip<00:01:23.009> but

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
thing to do is probably a poker chip but

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.830 
thing to do is probably a poker chip but
it<00:01:23.610> looks<00:01:23.790> really<00:01:23.970> suspicious<00:01:24.390> when<00:01:24.720> you're

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
it looks really suspicious when you're

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.140 
it looks really suspicious when you're
using<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.170> poker<00:01:25.380> chip<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:26.430> it's<00:01:26.549> best<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.909> use<00:01:27.000> a

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
using a poker chip so it's best to use a

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.910 
using a poker chip so it's best to use a
coin<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.020> can<00:01:28.170> even<00:01:28.350> ask<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.680> spectator

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
coin so you can even ask the spectator

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.660 
coin so you can even ask the spectator
for<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.630> um<00:01:30.770> so<00:01:31.770> as<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:31.979> said<00:01:32.159> yeah<00:01:32.310> this<00:01:32.430> trick

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
for it um so as I said yeah this trick

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.120 
for it um so as I said yeah this trick
will<00:01:33.090> hide<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:33.960> don't<00:01:34.170> do<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.409> too<00:01:34.650> much<00:01:34.680> when

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
will hide so don't do it too much when

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.190 
will hide so don't do it too much when
you<00:01:35.280> can't<00:01:35.520> do<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.820> as<00:01:35.939> well<00:01:36.090> just<00:01:36.119> don't<00:01:36.960> do<00:01:37.110> it

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
you can't do it as well just don't do it

it<00:01:51.270> all<00:01:51.390> happens<00:01:51.930> so<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.649> want<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.979> make<00:01:53.100> sure

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
it all happens so you want to make sure

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.770 
it all happens so you want to make sure
the<00:01:53.399> coin<00:01:53.579> is<00:01:53.670> close<00:01:53.939> enough<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.479> your<00:01:54.540> hand

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
the coin is close enough to your hand

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.109 
the coin is close enough to your hand
that<00:01:55.020> this<00:01:55.500> piece<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.920> muscle<00:01:56.040> can<00:01:56.399> get<00:01:56.729> over

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
that this piece of muscle can get over

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.539 
that this piece of muscle can get over
the<00:01:57.240> coin<00:01:57.590> to<00:01:58.590> do<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:59.070> just<00:01:59.130> need<00:01:59.250> to

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
the coin to do this you just need to

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.240 
the coin to do this you just need to
push<00:01:59.790> the<00:02:00.000> coin<00:02:00.240> down<00:02:00.540> first<00:02:01.009> okay<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.130> first

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
push the coin down first okay the first

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.100 
push the coin down first okay the first
step<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.729> push<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.060> coin<00:02:03.270> down<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.810> can<00:02:03.960> do

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
step is to push the coin down you can do

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.310 
step is to push the coin down you can do
this<00:02:04.320> with<00:02:04.530> your<00:02:04.649> fingers<00:02:05.040> but<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.670> more

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
this with your fingers but a more

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.540 
this with your fingers but a more
discreet<00:02:07.320> way<00:02:07.500> of<00:02:07.619> doing<00:02:07.829> it<00:02:07.950> is<00:02:08.009> push<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:08.399> down

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
discreet way of doing it is push it down

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.609 
discreet way of doing it is push it down
with<00:02:08.580> these<00:02:08.940> fingers<00:02:09.360> over<00:02:09.629> here<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.080> then

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
with these fingers over here and then

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.320 
with these fingers over here and then
you<00:02:10.649> come<00:02:10.950> over<00:02:11.129> with<00:02:11.370> your<00:02:11.489> thumb<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:12.030> you're

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
you come over with your thumb and you're

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.360 
you come over with your thumb and you're
in<00:02:12.420> position

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
in position

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.160 
in position
but<00:02:14.370> for<00:02:14.550> this<00:02:14.670> I'll<00:02:14.970> just<00:02:15.000> show<00:02:15.629> you<00:02:15.690> this<00:02:15.900> but

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
but for this I'll just show you this but

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.150 
but for this I'll just show you this but
you<00:02:16.379> don't<00:02:16.440> wanna<00:02:16.620> make<00:02:16.709> it<00:02:16.860> really<00:02:16.980> obvious

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
you don't wanna make it really obvious

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.309 
you don't wanna make it really obvious
that<00:02:17.459> you're<00:02:17.700> pushing<00:02:17.849> it<00:02:18.060> down<00:02:18.239> you<00:02:19.080> want<00:02:19.260> to

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
that you're pushing it down you want to

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:20.780 
that you're pushing it down you want to
just<00:02:19.440> make<00:02:19.620> it<00:02:19.739> seem<00:02:19.890> like<00:02:20.069> the<00:02:20.190> coins<00:02:20.400> flying

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
just make it seem like the coins flying

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.050 
just make it seem like the coins flying
up<00:02:21.590> so<00:02:22.590> what<00:02:22.739> you<00:02:22.830> do<00:02:23.010> is<00:02:23.220> you<00:02:23.519> push<00:02:23.730> it<00:02:23.879> down

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
up so what you do is you push it down

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.250 
up so what you do is you push it down
and<00:02:24.269> then<00:02:24.330> you<00:02:25.230> bring<00:02:25.500> your<00:02:26.190> thumb<00:02:26.519> over<00:02:27.260> the

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
and then you bring your thumb over the

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.130 
and then you bring your thumb over the
coin<00:02:28.910> okay<00:02:29.910> now<00:02:30.330> that's<00:02:30.510> you're<00:02:30.780> in<00:02:30.870> position

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
coin okay now that's you're in position

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.550 
coin okay now that's you're in position
to<00:02:31.440> do<00:02:31.590> this<00:02:32.390> so<00:02:33.390> all<00:02:33.540> you<00:02:33.690> have<00:02:33.870> to<00:02:33.900> do<00:02:34.140> is<00:02:34.290> push

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
to do this so all you have to do is push

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.680 
to do this so all you have to do is push
the<00:02:34.739> coin<00:02:34.950> down<00:02:35.190> thumb<00:02:35.880> over<00:02:36.180> it<00:02:36.269> and<00:02:36.390> then<00:02:36.569> you

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
the coin down thumb over it and then you

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.850 
the coin down thumb over it and then you
just<00:02:37.880> pull<00:02:38.880> down<00:02:39.150> with<00:02:39.480> your<00:02:39.540> thumb<00:02:39.870> muscle<00:02:40.260> so

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
just pull down with your thumb muscle so

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.839 
just pull down with your thumb muscle so
it's<00:02:40.980> just<00:02:41.160> over<00:02:41.519> and<00:02:41.750> down<00:02:43.489> when<00:02:44.489> you<00:02:44.610> start

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
it's just over and down when you start

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:46.699 
it's just over and down when you start
doing<00:02:45.090> this<00:02:45.239> you<00:02:45.299> might<00:02:45.720> get<00:02:46.080> it<00:02:46.170> to<00:02:46.319> flip<00:02:46.500> over

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
doing this you might get it to flip over

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.880 
doing this you might get it to flip over
maybe<00:02:47.519> even<00:02:47.819> jump<00:02:48.060> up<00:02:48.209> a<00:02:48.330> little<00:02:48.590> you'll<00:02:49.590> start

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
maybe even jump up a little you'll start

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.710 
maybe even jump up a little you'll start
to<00:02:50.040> get<00:02:50.220> some<00:02:50.430> air<00:02:50.670> on<00:02:50.700> it<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.120> you'll<00:02:51.420> just<00:02:51.450> be

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
to get some air on it and you'll just be

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.080 
to get some air on it and you'll just be
so<00:02:51.870> excited<00:02:52.160> once<00:02:53.160> you<00:02:53.310> can<00:02:53.459> get<00:02:53.579> it<00:02:53.760> you<00:02:53.970> know

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
so excited once you can get it you know

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.880 
so excited once you can get it you know
at<00:02:54.269> least<00:02:54.510> this<00:02:54.720> high<00:02:54.930> you<00:02:55.170> want<00:02:55.380> my<00:02:55.650> I<00:02:55.680> wanna

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
at least this high you want my I wanna

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.190 
at least this high you want my I wanna
stop<00:02:56.130> catching<00:02:56.400> it<00:02:56.730> so<00:02:57.480> to<00:02:57.540> catch<00:02:57.810> it

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
stop catching it so to catch it

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.830 
stop catching it so to catch it
quite<00:02:58.860> simply<00:02:59.160> just<00:02:59.190> put<00:03:00.090> your<00:03:00.180> non-dominant

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
quite simply just put your non-dominant

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.289 
quite simply just put your non-dominant
hand<00:03:00.890> over<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:02.010> coin<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.430> catch<00:03:02.790> it<00:03:02.819> when<00:03:03.180> it

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
hand over the coin and catch it when it

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.650 
hand over the coin and catch it when it
comes<00:03:04.160> so<00:03:05.160> yeah<00:03:05.280> that's<00:03:05.549> really<00:03:05.640> all<00:03:06.209> it<00:03:06.239> is<00:03:06.480> to

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
comes so yeah that's really all it is to

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.620 
comes so yeah that's really all it is to
the<00:03:06.810> trick<00:03:06.989> it's<00:03:07.230> called<00:03:07.440> a<00:03:07.500> muscle<00:03:07.890> pass<00:03:08.069> in

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
the trick it's called a muscle pass in

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.390 
the trick it's called a muscle pass in
the<00:03:09.630> magic<00:03:09.930> world<00:03:09.959> but<00:03:10.920> that<00:03:11.069> doesn't<00:03:11.310> sound

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
the magic world but that doesn't sound

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.860 
the magic world but that doesn't sound
really<00:03:11.760> good<00:03:11.910> when<00:03:12.120> you<00:03:12.239> should<00:03:12.569> say<00:03:12.810> to

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
really good when you should say to

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.559 
really good when you should say to
expect<00:03:13.230> a<00:03:13.349> degeneracy<00:03:13.829> a<00:03:13.980> muscle<00:03:14.400> pass<00:03:14.579> so

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
expect a degeneracy a muscle pass so

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.940 
expect a degeneracy a muscle pass so
again<00:03:16.230> you<00:03:16.530> just<00:03:16.709> coin<00:03:17.340> down<00:03:17.639> push<00:03:18.450> down

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
again you just coin down push down

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.390 
again you just coin down push down
muscle<00:03:19.950> over<00:03:20.310> and<00:03:21.180> pull<00:03:21.480> down<00:03:21.799> so<00:03:22.799> I<00:03:23.040> hope<00:03:23.250> this

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
muscle over and pull down so I hope this

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.120 
muscle over and pull down so I hope this
helps<00:03:23.730> just<00:03:24.060> be<00:03:24.480> persistent<00:03:25.109> keep<00:03:25.410> at<00:03:25.590> it<00:03:25.620> but

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
helps just be persistent keep at it but

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.460 
helps just be persistent keep at it but
don't<00:03:26.280> do<00:03:26.459> it<00:03:26.489> too<00:03:26.579> much<00:03:26.850> so<00:03:27.380> thanks<00:03:28.380> for

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470
