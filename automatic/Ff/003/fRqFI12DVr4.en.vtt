00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.830
 I want to have this seat in Nuremberg 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.840

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.210

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:10.730
 The environment became like mine 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.990
 bad to pick up but yes I say I 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.000
 So everything worked great 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.170
 the one also very nice and the lenses 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.420
 are so beautiful and so 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.030

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.280
