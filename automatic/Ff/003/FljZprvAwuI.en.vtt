00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.139
 hello how are thayer and here and today we go 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.789
 to prepare what are the rich strawberries 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:21.970
 with cream and what we need is that 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:24.789
 we need 500 grams of strawberries at 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:29.140
 which of the adarve already disinfects 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:31.010
 I took away what is the little tail 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.650
 we must wash them 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.540
 and disinfect them together with the tail and 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.540
 then remove the tail to make it 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:42.000
 more effective 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:46.559
 disinfectant and here what we have is 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.170
 three quarters of a cup of sugar and we're going to 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.410
 need a fret in which we are going to 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.240
 put the strawberries and we need a 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:59.980
 little room of cream and one 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:03.020
 fork to be able to make the movements 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.300
 The first thing we are going to do is that 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.560
 We are going to cut these six dams in 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:13.730
 little squares I'm going to cut into squares 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:17.840
 I tell them what yes here we already have the 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:19.909
 chopped strawberries with four parts 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.520
 depending on the size why times that 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.100
 Up to six parts we are going to make 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:28.509
 So what we are following now is that 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:32.920
 let's empty the fret what is the 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:36.280
 cream and we're going to empty it 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.939
 the sugar because we're going to do here is 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.100
 that is removing joel calaveras the 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:46.360
 I'm going to leave because nothing else is I am 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:49.630
 slow I can not shoot but right now 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.240
 come back all this we are going to stir 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.899
 happens that he wakes up rather in 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.200
 box office is not painted is sugar then 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:01.710
 Now, see how you are doing 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.710
 the sugar 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.450
 and until almost 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:30.760
 so now what we are going to do is 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:35.400
 add the dams then here already 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.400
 they're stirring 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.290
 with nothing more to put in the refrigerator 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:54.940
 to get a little more cold 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:58.110
 and this better the glass 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:01.230

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.620

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:08.180

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.390
