00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.799

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:25.020
 this trick like another one that I will upload also 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.470
 I think that term of this tutorial - 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.919
 I teach torino 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:34.970
 I'll leave you some video of yours 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:37.730
 encounter or something similar is worth the 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.879
 clubs for the curious and those who 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.399
 you always ask me what kind of 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:46.670
 I use malabar and all that is about 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:49.550
 rubber clubs I ordered them to the store 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.730
 k-8 online brought us to pyramids 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.440
 from there and good the truth is that for 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.240
 have their three years are lasting me 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.270
 quite compared to other 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:06.300
 good the trick 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:09.090
 you are legos de mazas you will start like this 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.670
 if it were a piece of tetrix you see the 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.670
 left mass we have it thus entering 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.520
 towards the camera or the rest the mass 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.430
 central is transversal of the other 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.330
 two clubs and then the third mass is 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:27.200
 here with 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.690
 the cue looking down go to the club 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.730
 as such up 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.730
 then the trick itself would be this ok 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.090
 I do not know if you have appreciated me well 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.090
 but good 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.979
 what's important in the position and you'll see 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.229
 which it is a very simple trick all 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.840
 what you have to do is turn your wrist 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.720
 up and you see I was lame vale 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:59.159
 then it falls and stays in the 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:01.859
 inverted position turn almuñécar up 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:05.940
 we are already moving her from her position 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:08.600
 down we would put here 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.600
 you see 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.450
 it's quite simple, we climb towards 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.239
 above 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.650
 and so then how nice of this trick 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.650
 that was when it's done 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.240
 in this way towards laterals or you are 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.240

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.520
 ways to start then man 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.900
 d 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:39.450
 juggle with the three clubs to get 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:44.490
 here is a bit difficult so I 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:47.550
 I recommend that you start like this and good 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:50.160
