00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 I'll make it for you, sweetheart today. 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.410
 strawberry truffle poxa life she 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.450
 said it's cool and of course you will 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.469
 to use other truffle flavors 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.429
 also the history of the 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.070
 air 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.010
 the boat here you will need to do 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.300
 this recipe 500 grams of chocolate 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.060
 White 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.869
 to the filling 250 grams of chocolate 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.929
 white 100 grams of cream and 15 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.430
 grams of powder for the preparation of desserts 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:35.190
 bubbling like I'm using 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.590
 chocolate and I need to shock 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.960
 to the crystalline form of the 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.280
 right on the cover I do not need 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.649
 give a heat shock 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.289
 chop the little grandson chocolate he is 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.020
 chopped easier to melt and here 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.329
 Let's take it to melt possible 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.690
 Melt at 45 degrees 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.030
 But here he is already melted 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.039
 and here I am going to start doing mine. 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.890
 shock after the repeat 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.739
 this way and nothing too hot and 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.409
 I need to lower the temperature that said 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.260
 product or working with it will 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.229
 around 8 to 10 minutes 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.259
 if you need more information we 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.299
 we have a specific video talking about 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.210
 thermal shock on our youtube channel 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.500
 Oh, it's arrived at the correct temperature. 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.689
 Nice with the decision you used yesterday one 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.740
 good thermometer from bertha street order more 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.799
 easy ok 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.579
 and here we go back to Brasilia here 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:35.189
 again it 's important not personal because 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.040
 if this thermal shock is not done 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.950
 in the right way I can have a good 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.200
 that does not go out of the way a good one that later 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.340
 he is suddenly taken away and with much 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.740
 facility 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.549
 the importance of this process in the 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.860
 kitchen 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.500
 I came back here to my container as 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.960
 mix and I'll put my shape and 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.930
 There we will make the cone of this 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.969
 candy will be a cone to make fun veil 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.570
 but with a cavity to be able 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.610
 If that's what I'm talking about here . 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.850
 strawberry fayre 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.679
 so this is the correct process there to 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.720
 make a fantasy a good cone 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.850
 That I already read the excerpt and all my 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.180
 family here is all I'm going to do 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:24.440
 what you hit with a spatula here 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:25.760
 to take all the bubbles take these 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.670
 bubbles is important not to get even 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.940
 a hole in the girl's butt take the 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.940
 excess 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:41.050
 and my 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.569
 I already took all the excess and now 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.690
 I'm going to come here to form my cone 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:49.209
 I decided to show a time to train 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.430
 this cone and now removes the excess 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.830
 What are you talking about? 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.239
 taubatÃ© and it's also no use doing 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.610
 That bony thing is 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:01.330
 very close to the hit 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:04.030
 and here I 've dropped all my excess and I'm going 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.880
 take to refrigerator time refrigerator 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.769
 around 3 to 4 minutes so do not 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.569
 I leave fully crystallize 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:13.660
 because if at the time I put my 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:15.790
 chocolate to cover and is removed from the 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.840
 Forminha he will leave only the champion was 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.000
 This I need to leave 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.230
 crystallizing there a question of three to 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.420
 four minutes 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.579
 We are going to start preparing our 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.010
 strawberry truffle stuffing 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:29.379
 Just remembering or paying, I'll do it. 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.049
 any kind of filling I do not 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:34.329
 I need a shock to have ours. 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:37.660
 then it 's just me 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:42.209
 melt and already Israeli attack cute 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:45.549
 to'll also need the cream 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:49.299
 and our point to survive said to 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:52.930
 I like the strawberry flavor nice then I go 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:55.329
 put a spoon here from the dessert powder 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.010
 and there you can if you mix it in cream 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:00.430
 of pure milk this in the cream of milk 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.169
 foreground to dissolve it in here 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.540
 sour cream first because if I 

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:07.419
 put it straight into the chocolate it will goes 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.849
 hardening will not solve legal then 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:12.220
 here is the first meca in the cream of 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:13.030
 milk looks only if it's going to rain or from here 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.889
 milk cream 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:19.870
 after it has subsided I mix it in my 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:23.470
 chocolate and here is the subway and then I 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.920
 I see you can have dessert and it dissolves 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:29.130
 well in 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:31.040
 everything is going to commercials, it's really cool, I 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:34.500
 put it right here is how chocolate is 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:38.970
 crystallize Roberto and he will not do 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:43.140
 in time 6 a mixture that very well and 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:46.680
 Let's put the stuffing here, mango taste. 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:48.870
 of confectionery because every good taste is 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.270
 one who has a thin crust and one 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:54.450
 Good amount of Israel 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:57.390
 happen to our will also serve 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:05:00.230
 put the amount not much because I 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:03.540
 I need to have a pac after him. 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:06.420
 whenever I thought of the filling and I 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.850
 think of leaving a space to make the 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:11.460
 The final chocolate chip I 'm going to 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:13.680
 to use to cap this bonbon too 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.540
 a chocolate that was made a shock 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.220
 this is very important. 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.680
 nekounam after our box that stays 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:22.530
 perfect and not only the cap every 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.410
 rectangle that here now minus chocolate 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:32.460
 I'll put the right amount in the cane and 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:34.650
 bathroom close these good think all it 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:38.130

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:43.370
 too much chocolate I'm going to take the 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:50.550
 and here with the larger spatula 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:53.430
 iraque all my excess and now leads 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.260
 to totally crystallize it then 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:57.450
 I'm taking our weak form 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.970
