00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
the Springfield police station playset

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.749 
the Springfield police station playset
and<00:00:12.900> this<00:00:13.469> was<00:00:13.620> my<00:00:13.740> first<00:00:13.889> place<00:00:14.219> set<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.639> go

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
and this was my first place set to go

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.050 
and this was my first place set to go
dead<00:00:15.030> on<00:00:15.210> me<00:00:15.360> so<00:00:16.080> I<00:00:16.109> had<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.410> do<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:17.060> battery

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
dead on me so I had to do a battery

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.230 
dead on me so I had to do a battery
ectomy<00:00:18.510> on<00:00:18.690> it<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.220> I<00:00:20.220> don't<00:00:20.670> like<00:00:20.820> opening

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
ectomy on it and I don't like opening

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.580 
ectomy on it and I don't like opening
these<00:00:21.330> things<00:00:21.630> but<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.930> batteries<00:00:22.260> have<00:00:22.410> to

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
these things but the batteries have to

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.529 
these things but the batteries have to
go<00:00:22.740> when<00:00:22.949> they<00:00:23.039> start<00:00:23.250> corroding<00:00:23.369> so<00:00:24.240> what<00:00:24.510> I

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
go when they start corroding so what I

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.310 
go when they start corroding so what I
did<00:00:24.630> was<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:25.019> took<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.830> place<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.220> out<00:00:26.400> and

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
did was I took the place that out and

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.450 
did was I took the place that out and
just<00:00:28.320> kind<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.560> figured<00:00:28.769> out<00:00:28.980> where<00:00:29.220> the

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
just kind of figured out where the

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.370 
just kind of figured out where the
batteries<00:00:30.449> are<00:00:30.630> there<00:00:30.810> right<00:00:30.990> there<00:00:31.199> but<00:00:31.349> I

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
batteries are there right there but I

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.440 
batteries are there right there but I
had<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.560> use<00:00:31.590> like<00:00:31.800> an<00:00:31.920> exacto<00:00:32.399> knife<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.910> don't

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
had to use like an exacto knife I don't

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.240 
had to use like an exacto knife I don't
want<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.660> ruin<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.230> play<00:00:34.469> set<00:00:34.739> but<00:00:34.890> I<00:00:34.920> have<00:00:35.160> to

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
want to ruin the play set but I have to

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.380 
want to ruin the play set but I have to
get<00:00:35.340> those<00:00:35.460> batteries<00:00:35.790> out<00:00:35.910> because<00:00:36.180> if<00:00:36.300> they

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
get those batteries out because if they

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.400 
get those batteries out because if they
corrode<00:00:36.690> it'll<00:00:37.559> really<00:00:37.710> be<00:00:37.950> ruined<00:00:38.510> so<00:00:39.510> this

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
corrode it'll really be ruined so this

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.260 
corrode it'll really be ruined so this
one<00:00:40.590> does<00:00:40.739> not<00:00:40.890> work<00:00:41.070> anymore<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.850> works<00:00:42.090> just

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
one does not work anymore it works just

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.830 
one does not work anymore it works just
need<00:00:42.600> batteries<00:00:42.960> in<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.200> but<00:00:44.010> all<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.370> others

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
need batteries in it but all the others

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.600 
need batteries in it but all the others
