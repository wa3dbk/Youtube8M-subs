00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:08.340
 hello today we're going to stamp a shirt 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.440
 with cherry and colors for it that 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.040
 we need fabrics with colors 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.130
 that we choose a light colored shirt 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:21.539
 preferably a paper sharpener 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.789
 vegetable and an iron and also a folio 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.690
 or a cardboard that we will have to put 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.690
 under the shirt 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.980
 we have done the drawing we want for 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.530
 shirt with a pencil is marked 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.710
 you can not appreciate it and the 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:41.710
 Next step is to take out next to 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.550
 colors that we have chosen because we are going to 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.550
 use the chips 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.469
 we have the point taken out of each mancera 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.710
 of color no longer what we have to do 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:56.100
 is to catch the one that comes to our 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.100
 drawing 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.270
 we have already filled in the whole drawing with 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.450
 the chips and as you see we have done in 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.400
 star then we clean the rest of 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.850
 chips that have stayed with much 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.850
 watch out 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.140
 carefully so that it does not move 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:28.530
 we have to put the paper vegetable paper 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.530
 kitchen oven 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.600
 and with the hot iron but not at 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.600
 maximum we passed it over 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.930
 the ironing we retreat with much 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.800
 care of paper 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.800
 and we see that our drawing has remained 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.800
 print 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.009
 we removed the paper that we had put 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:59.350
 down to prevent it from penetrating the 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.860
 back and we have the shirt 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.860
 made 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.289
