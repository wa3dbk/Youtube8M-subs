the<00:01:47.579> map<00:01:47.790> but<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.299> nice<00:01:48.990> touches<00:01:49.320> at<00:01:49.619> the

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
the map but a nice touches at the

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.859 
the map but a nice touches at the
outside<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.399> map<00:01:50.520> is<00:01:50.700> also<00:01:51.030> desert<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:51.810> you

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
outside of the map is also desert so you

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.160 
outside of the map is also desert so you
actually<00:01:52.140> get<00:01:52.590> this<00:01:53.329> feeling<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.570> you're

actually get this feeling that you're

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.170 
actually get this feeling that you're
you're<00:01:55.680> in<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.950> right<00:01:56.130> position<00:01:56.700> you<00:01:56.969> don't

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
you're in the right position you don't

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.530 
you're in the right position you don't
have<00:01:57.509> this<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:57.990> then<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.110> suddenly<00:01:58.950> have<00:01:59.250> a

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
have this and then you suddenly have a

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.700 
have this and then you suddenly have a
something<00:02:00.540> random<00:02:00.930> on<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.079> outside<00:02:01.469> like<00:02:01.680> a

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
something random on the outside like a

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.649 
something random on the outside like a
snow<00:02:02.549> bomb<00:02:02.790> on<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.060> outside<00:02:03.420> actually

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
snow bomb on the outside actually

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.600 
snow bomb on the outside actually
thought<00:02:04.049> about<00:02:04.079> placement<00:02:04.619> of<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.130> map<00:02:05.340> and

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
I'm sure they went through a couple of

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.080 
I'm sure they went through a couple of
seats<00:02:07.740> before<00:02:08.009> they<00:02:08.310> found<00:02:08.489> one<00:02:08.789> that<00:02:08.970> they

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
seats before they found one that they
