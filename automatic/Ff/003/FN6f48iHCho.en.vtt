landing<00:00:23.270> is<00:00:23.390> a<00:00:23.420> beautiful<00:00:23.960> thing

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
landing is a beautiful thing

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.019 
landing is a beautiful thing
but<00:00:24.619> if<00:00:24.710> you<00:00:24.800> have<00:00:24.920> any<00:00:25.099> sort<00:00:25.279> of<00:00:25.400> cross<00:00:25.700> with

in a tailwheel airplane like this cub

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:29.980 
in a tailwheel airplane like this cub
you'll<00:00:28.520> be<00:00:28.700> glad<00:00:28.849> that<00:00:29.180> you<00:00:29.300> dialed<00:00:29.720> in<00:00:29.840> your

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:29.990 
you'll be glad that you dialed in your

field<00:00:32.119> with<00:00:32.239> try<00:00:32.480> a<00:00:32.510> couple<00:00:32.870> and<00:00:33.170> then<00:00:33.290> I'll

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
field with try a couple and then I'll

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.930 
field with try a couple and then I'll
show<00:00:33.650> you<00:00:33.710> a<00:00:33.800> couple<00:00:34.160> common<00:00:34.879> weilert<00:00:35.449> errors

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
show you a couple common weilert errors

show you a couple common weilert errors
so<00:00:37.940> the<00:00:38.059> pattern<00:00:38.480> and<00:00:38.750> approach<00:00:39.140> for<00:00:39.680> a<00:00:39.710> real

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:39.949 
so the pattern and approach for a real

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:42.070 
so the pattern and approach for a real
landing<00:00:40.460> is<00:00:40.580> identical<00:00:41.300> to<00:00:41.330> a<00:00:41.480> three-point

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.080

keep<00:00:46.220> a<00:00:46.370> little<00:00:46.550> airspeed<00:00:47.420> you<00:00:47.540> have<00:00:47.659> to<00:00:47.809> bring

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:48.019 
keep a little airspeed you have to bring

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:49.719 
keep a little airspeed you have to bring
some<00:00:48.260> energy<00:00:48.379> to<00:00:48.680> the<00:00:48.949> runway<00:00:49.309> in<00:00:49.460> a<00:00:49.550> wheel

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
little energy in there the whole point

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.300 
little energy in there the whole point
of<00:01:05.810> this<00:01:05.990> we've<00:01:06.200> got<00:01:06.380> a<00:01:06.409> nice<00:01:06.680> displaced

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
of this we've got a nice displaced

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.510 
of this we've got a nice displaced
threshold<00:01:07.640> here<00:01:08.150> on<00:01:08.270> to<00:01:08.510> 6<00:01:08.810> left<00:01:09.110> is<00:01:09.440> a<00:01:09.920> minimum

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
threshold here on to 6 left is a minimum

threshold here on to 6 left is a minimum
descent<00:01:11.180> rate<00:01:11.420> so<00:01:11.810> I<00:01:11.840> really<00:01:12.409> want<00:01:12.590> to<00:01:12.710> slow

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
descent rate so I really want to slow

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.190 
descent rate so I really want to slow
that<00:01:13.130> descent<00:01:13.580> rate<00:01:13.820> down<00:01:14.060> get<00:01:14.750> it<00:01:14.869> over<00:01:15.080> the

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
that descent rate down get it over the

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.620 
that descent rate down get it over the
runway<00:01:15.560> we<00:01:16.400> do<00:01:16.549> have<00:01:16.729> some<00:01:16.969> win<00:01:17.180> here<00:01:17.450> today

about<00:01:17.960> eight<00:01:18.170> or<00:01:18.320> ten<00:01:18.500> knots<00:01:18.770> but<00:01:19.009> it's<00:01:19.159> pretty

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
about eight or ten knots but it's pretty

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.219 
about eight or ten knots but it's pretty
much<00:01:19.609> right<00:01:19.880> down<00:01:20.090> the<00:01:20.299> runway<00:01:20.659> so<00:01:20.719> on<00:01:20.960> short

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
much right down the runway so on short

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:22.959 
much right down the runway so on short
final<00:01:21.500> in<00:01:21.829> case<00:01:21.979> I<00:01:22.159> have<00:01:22.280> to<00:01:22.399> do<00:01:22.520> a<00:01:22.549> go-around

I'm going to turn carb heat off I'm

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.969 
I'm going to turn carb heat off I'm
keeping<00:01:25.340> a<00:01:25.399> little<00:01:25.640> power<00:01:26.119> in<00:01:26.560> not<00:01:27.560> quite<00:01:27.770> it

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
keeping a little power in not quite it

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:29.950

by<00:01:28.100> sixty-five<00:01:28.850> and<00:01:28.880> I'm<00:01:29.149> just<00:01:29.329> holding<00:01:29.869> it

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
by sixty-five and I'm just holding it

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.249 
by sixty-five and I'm just holding it
off<00:01:30.140> as<00:01:30.439> long<00:01:30.770> as<00:01:31.009> I<00:01:31.130> can<00:01:31.189> hold<00:01:31.850> it<00:01:32.060> off<00:01:32.240> hold<00:01:32.960> it

right there power comes back stick goes

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.800 
right there power comes back stick goes
forward<00:01:40.460> it's<00:01:40.700> a<00:01:40.759> negative<00:01:41.060> angle<00:01:41.420> of<00:01:41.689> attack

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810

I'm<00:01:42.380> trying<00:01:43.039> to<00:01:43.159> keep<00:01:43.340> the<00:01:43.490> tail<00:01:43.729> up<00:01:43.999> when<00:01:44.210> I

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
I'm trying to keep the tail up when I

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.899 
I'm trying to keep the tail up when I
feel<00:01:44.570> the<00:01:44.810> tail<00:01:45.049> come<00:01:45.439> down<00:01:45.740> I'm<00:01:46.070> going<00:01:46.850> to

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
feel the tail come down I'm going to

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.499 
feel the tail come down I'm going to
bring<00:01:47.179> it<00:01:47.299> back<00:01:47.479> decisively<00:01:49.030> and<00:01:50.030> get<00:01:50.329> that

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
bring it back decisively and get that

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.510 
bring it back decisively and get that
tail<00:01:50.810> that's<00:01:51.079> the<00:01:51.259> gray<00:01:51.530> area<00:01:51.950> right<00:01:52.189> there

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
tail that's the gray area right there

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.279 
tail that's the gray area right there
that<00:01:53.509> you<00:01:53.719> want<00:01:53.899> to<00:01:54.020> be<00:01:54.109> real<00:01:54.439> cautious<00:01:54.950> of<00:01:56.289> so

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
going to add a little power here so I

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.180 
going to add a little power here so I
get<00:02:20.660> to<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:20.900> runway<00:02:21.110> and<00:02:21.470> also<00:02:21.709> so<00:02:21.860> I<00:02:21.890> keep

mistake which is to bring the tail down
too<00:03:14.330> soon<00:03:14.630> and<00:03:14.900> you'll<00:03:15.170> see<00:03:15.380> if<00:03:15.500> I<00:03:15.650> do<00:03:15.710> that<00:03:16.010> the

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
too soon and you'll see if I do that the

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.250 
too soon and you'll see if I do that the
angle<00:03:16.490> of<00:03:16.610> attack<00:03:16.670> increases<00:03:17.120> I'm<00:03:17.690> sued<00:03:17.930> if<00:03:18.140> I

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
angle of attack increases I'm sued if I

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.750 
angle of attack increases I'm sued if I
do<00:03:18.320> it<00:03:18.530> too<00:03:18.680> soon<00:03:18.890> it<00:03:19.100> means<00:03:19.220> I<00:03:19.340> still<00:03:19.610> have

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
do it too soon it means I still have

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.910 
do it too soon it means I still have
energy<00:03:19.910> in<00:03:20.330> the<00:03:20.420> form<00:03:20.570> of<00:03:20.750> airspeed<00:03:21.230> and<00:03:21.410> the

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.780 
runway I hold it off I hold it off keep
the<00:03:32.120> tail<00:03:32.360> up<00:03:32.630> there<00:03:33.290> it<00:03:33.440> is<00:03:33.590> power<00:03:34.340> comes<00:03:34.700> back

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
the tail up there it is power comes back

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.030 
the tail up there it is power comes back
to<00:03:35.120> idle<00:03:35.510> and<00:03:35.690> then<00:03:36.080> I<00:03:36.110> bring<00:03:36.410> the<00:03:36.560> tail<00:03:36.800> back

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
to idle and then I bring the tail back

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.530 
to idle and then I bring the tail back
point<00:03:37.610> takes<00:03:37.850> off<00:03:38.090> again

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
point takes off again

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.750 
point takes off again
now<00:03:38.630> even<00:03:38.840> though<00:03:39.050> man's<00:03:39.350> layout<00:03:39.770> there<00:03:39.950> so

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
now even though man's layout there so

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.550 
now even though man's layout there so
you<00:03:40.820> see<00:03:41.150> what<00:03:41.300> happens<00:03:41.690> there<00:03:41.959> you<00:03:42.200> go<00:03:42.380> around

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
you see what happens there you go around

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.860 
you see what happens there you go around
no<00:03:43.550> good<00:03:43.790> can<00:03:44.030> come<00:03:44.060> by<00:03:44.360> that<00:03:44.510> I'm<00:03:44.660> going<00:03:44.810> to

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
no good can come by that I'm going to

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.370 
no good can come by that I'm going to
start<00:03:45.110> a<00:03:45.200> porpoise<00:03:45.709> and<00:03:45.920> I'm<00:03:46.010> going<00:03:46.190> to<00:03:46.220> start

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
start a porpoise and I'm going to start

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.020 
start a porpoise and I'm going to start
bouncing<00:03:48.380> all<00:03:48.530> over<00:03:48.560> the<00:03:48.920> place<00:03:49.160> so<00:03:49.370> you<00:03:49.700> got

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
bouncing all over the place so you got

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.150 
bouncing all over the place so you got
to<00:03:50.180> wait<00:03:50.330> till<00:03:50.570> the<00:03:50.690> tail<00:03:50.959> loses<00:03:51.470> energy<00:03:51.709> it

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
to wait till the tail loses energy it

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.190 
to wait till the tail loses energy it
starts<00:03:52.670> to<00:03:52.850> come<00:03:53.060> down<00:03:53.270> on<00:03:53.300> its<00:03:53.660> own<00:03:53.840> and<00:03:54.110> then

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
starts to come down on its own and then

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.500 
starts to come down on its own and then
you<00:03:54.440> just<00:03:54.709> help<00:03:54.950> it<00:03:55.130> along<00:03:55.430> it<00:03:55.850> bring<00:03:56.360> the

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
you just help it along it bring the

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.810 
you just help it along it bring the
stick<00:03:56.750> back<00:03:56.959> into<00:03:57.500> your<00:03:57.680> gut<00:03:57.890> and<00:03:58.070> plant<00:03:58.610> that

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
tail wheel off the runway don't get in a

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.460 
tail wheel off the runway don't get in a
hurry<00:04:01.640> to<00:04:01.970> bring<00:04:02.180> the<00:04:02.300> tail<00:04:02.540> down<00:04:02.840> if<00:04:03.020> it<00:04:03.140> still

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
hurry to bring the tail down if it still

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.100 
hurry to bring the tail down if it still
wants<00:04:03.830> to<00:04:03.980> fly<00:04:04.420> alright<00:04:05.420> so<00:04:05.600> at<00:04:05.720> this<00:04:05.840> wheel

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
wants to fly alright so at this wheel

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:07.360 
wants to fly alright so at this wheel
I'm<00:04:06.290> going<00:04:06.470> to<00:04:06.560> show<00:04:06.709> you<00:04:06.770> another<00:04:07.070> common

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
I'm going to show you another common

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.550 
I'm going to show you another common
mistake<00:04:07.670> which<00:04:08.150> is<00:04:08.360> too<00:04:08.720> fast<00:04:08.990> of<00:04:09.260> a<00:04:09.350> rate<00:04:09.530> of

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
mistake which is too fast of a rate of

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.770 
mistake which is too fast of a rate of
descent<00:04:10.070> not<00:04:10.280> holding<00:04:10.820> it<00:04:10.940> off<00:04:11.090> if<00:04:11.330> I<00:04:11.450> let<00:04:11.660> the

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780 
descent not holding it off if I let the

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.310 
descent not holding it off if I let the
wheels<00:04:12.080> touch<00:04:13.330> with<00:04:14.330> a<00:04:14.360> pretty<00:04:14.660> high<00:04:14.900> rate<00:04:15.140> of

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
wheels touch with a pretty high rate of

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.680 
wheels touch with a pretty high rate of
descent<00:04:15.770> it's<00:04:16.669> going<00:04:16.850> to<00:04:16.940> bounce<00:04:17.209> and<00:04:17.540> it's

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
descent it's going to bounce and it's

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.390 
descent it's going to bounce and it's
going<00:04:17.840> to<00:04:17.930> go<00:04:18.080> back<00:04:18.320> into<00:04:18.590> the<00:04:18.770> air<00:04:19.010> when<00:04:19.280> it

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
going to go back into the air when it

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.190 
going to go back into the air when it
does<00:04:19.640> that<00:04:19.940> it's<00:04:20.209> going<00:04:20.390> to<00:04:20.450> go<00:04:20.660> from<00:04:20.900> being<00:04:21.049> a

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
does that it's going to go from being a

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.200 
does that it's going to go from being a
ground-based<00:04:21.680> vehicle<00:04:22.340> to<00:04:22.790> a<00:04:22.820> flying

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
ground-based vehicle to a flying

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.180 
ground-based vehicle to a flying
airplane<00:04:23.780> again<00:04:23.960> so<00:04:24.290> watch<00:04:24.470> what<00:04:24.740> happens

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
airplane again so watch what happens

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.010 
airplane again so watch what happens
I've<00:04:25.340> keep<00:04:25.520> it<00:04:25.669> way<00:04:25.850> too<00:04:25.910> much<00:04:26.240> airspeed<00:04:26.840> in

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
I've keep it way too much airspeed in

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.409 
I've keep it way too much airspeed in
here<00:04:27.320> it's<00:04:28.070> kind<00:04:28.490> of<00:04:28.580> hard<00:04:28.640> once<00:04:29.120> you<00:04:29.270> get

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
here it's kind of hard once you get

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:31.510 
here it's kind of hard once you get
these<00:04:29.630> dialed<00:04:30.140> in<00:04:30.290> to<00:04:30.470> go<00:04:30.650> back<00:04:30.860> and<00:04:31.100> do<00:04:31.340> them

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
these dialed in to go back and do them

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.900 
these dialed in to go back and do them
intentionally<00:04:32.390> wrong<00:04:33.340> we'll<00:04:34.340> see<00:04:34.580> how<00:04:34.700> this

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
intentionally wrong we'll see how this

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.540 
intentionally wrong we'll see how this
works<00:04:35.180> I'm<00:04:35.540> bringing<00:04:36.169> some<00:04:36.380> airspeed<00:04:37.250> to<00:04:37.430> the

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
works I'm bringing some airspeed to the

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.070 
works I'm bringing some airspeed to the
runway<00:04:37.970> it<00:04:38.780> is<00:04:38.960> a<00:04:38.990> right<00:04:39.350> cross<00:04:39.560> with

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
runway it is a right cross with

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.200 
runway it is a right cross with
so<00:04:40.319> this<00:04:40.470> should<00:04:40.650> be<00:04:40.680> fun<00:04:41.099> if<00:04:41.580> theory<00:04:42.090> I<00:04:42.120> should

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
so this should be fun if theory I should

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.480 
so this should be fun if theory I should
land<00:04:42.629> on<00:04:42.840> that<00:04:43.020> right<00:04:43.229> wheel<00:04:43.470> first<00:04:43.830> so<00:04:44.190> again

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
land on that right wheel first so again

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.189 
land on that right wheel first so again
I'm<00:04:44.639> trying<00:04:44.849> to<00:04:44.970> keep<00:04:45.150> too<00:04:45.360> much<00:04:45.539> power<00:04:45.840> and

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199 
I'm trying to keep too much power and

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:47.719 
I'm trying to keep too much power and
I'm<00:04:46.289> in<00:04:46.409> a<00:04:46.440> hurry<00:04:46.680> I'm<00:04:47.009> trying<00:04:47.280> to<00:04:47.370> get<00:04:47.520> down

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
I'm in a hurry I'm trying to get down

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:49.879 
I'm in a hurry I'm trying to get down
there<00:04:47.940> I<00:04:47.970> got<00:04:48.180> way<00:04:48.389> too<00:04:48.539> much<00:04:48.870> airspeed<00:04:49.500> I'm

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:49.889 
there I got way too much airspeed I'm

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:51.980 
there I got way too much airspeed I'm
going<00:04:50.190> to<00:04:50.280> come<00:04:50.430> in<00:04:50.580> I'm<00:04:50.729> going<00:04:50.879> to<00:04:50.940> land<00:04:51.180> still

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
going to come in I'm going to land still

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.059 
going to come in I'm going to land still
got<00:04:52.199> power<00:04:52.440> it

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:53.069 
got power it

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:57.460 
got power it
there's<00:04:53.669> my<00:04:53.849> right<00:04:54.120> cross<00:04:54.449> with

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.500 

because<00:04:58.470> the<00:04:58.650> ring<00:04:58.890> is<00:04:58.920> not<00:04:59.100> stalled<00:04:59.790> it<00:05:00.210> just

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
because the ring is not stalled it just

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.390 
because the ring is not stalled it just
takes<00:05:00.810> off<00:05:01.020> again<00:05:01.350> and<00:05:01.470> begins<00:05:01.770> flying<00:05:02.100> it's

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
takes off again and begins flying it's

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.390 
takes off again and begins flying it's
no<00:05:02.580> good<00:05:02.820> I<00:05:03.410> would<00:05:04.410> be<00:05:04.590> able<00:05:04.740> to<00:05:04.980> hold<00:05:05.190> the

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
no good I would be able to hold the

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.220 
no good I would be able to hold the
airplane<00:05:05.790> on<00:05:05.940> the<00:05:05.970> runway<00:05:06.090> under<00:05:06.660> control
