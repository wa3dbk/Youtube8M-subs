 Mr. Tenken, 38, who is the store manager doing this training 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.280
 Not 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:16.650
 Mr. Rama who usually works at tax office 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:22.520
 Awakening to the fun of dancing triggered by dancing in a series of acquaintances 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.520
 Five years ago, I went through a trial with my friends 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:33.840
 Bloom the festival of flowers in the city of source-tree bee of the Palais of name 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:38.840
 Aiming for the production in August with that thought 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.840
 I sweat a couple of times a week 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:51.539
 A hot festival of dancers unfolded on a summer night 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:51.539
 As it is 3 f 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:02:02.480
 Nearly 60 reams participated in the baseball fist dance in two days 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:02.480
 Show me a hot performance, each elaborate 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.990
 It Ide If Ke's from one-shot eyes 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.850
 Aren't Mr. Amano's Ren shows an original dance with the theme of Ibiki 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.930
 It is a movement with an unfamiliar feel and is used tough 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:44.650
 About 120 members of this year's members are different in face tools such as student fielders and 2 adults 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:48.900
 I want to dance even if I practice hard 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.900
 The desire to enjoy is common 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.850
 Everybody is alive 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.440
 Have a pleasant atmosphere 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:01.800
 I think it's very good 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:07.620
 It will become fun of going to remember what or 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:09.290
 There is a feeling like a club activity that gently remembers when I was a student 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.340
 From the time of practice 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:17.540
 It's been a lot of fun and it's getting more expensive during production 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:23.440
 From time to time is that Well really practice I mean what solving there was more team after the end tonight 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:27.500
 I think that the place where you can have fun and enjoy until the end of the production is the attraction and the inside of the house 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:35.600
 A sense of unity created by enjoying the dance 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:39.110
 However , Amano, who is an extension , has a complex thought that he finished the second consecutive victory 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.030
 I thought that it is the last year can be honest win 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.510
 So 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.980
 When I thought so, I was taught Akan but 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:49.870
 It is a good feeling 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:51.630
 I thought it would be good to practice the land, but if I look back and look at the video 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.480
 Because we did medium together Well 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:59.489
 A liner to practice even if what I thought 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.900
 I think that it is best to do what I am doing because I can not see MariÃ©. 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:07.400
 Because 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:07.400
 It is the neighborhood, but it would have been okay even when I thought I could win 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.100
 To the top of the second time with friends 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:24.570
 And Amano- san is not just his own group 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.570
 There is also a thought for the Matsuyama Festival itself 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:34.380
 Planet Festival has a half-century history of nearly 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:42.750
 Yakyuken it up also became One of the summer tradition of under f now 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:46.910
 However, it is necessary to devise a few more festivals from the participants and the executive committee in the past several years 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.910
 There are a lot of indications such as 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:54.789
 In fact, although the Shikoku 4 major festivals of summer are inscribed 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:05:03.000
 Liven up administrative and regions in unison 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:05:07.620
 Even the number of spectators is open to water in Tokushima Awa Odori and Kochi Yosakoi Odori 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:13.350
 That Well originally it is tan and went to see every year I like and dance 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:14.560
 After all it becomes more and more love from Ya festival of his city try to dance for the first time Matsuyama fishing yourself 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:18.470
 Go 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:21.100
 After all it is regrettable after all that is right here 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:23.370
 Those who are dancing are also really told 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:28.320
 The audience is also full there 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:29.420
 Well myself becoming quite changed now I'm supposed there was a festival has been Yarasa until now 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.500
 I want to dance 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:34.569
 I think people in the company group are also changing to wait for what they want to do 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:39.340
 Because 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:46.090
 I'm not waiting for you to do something else 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:52.710
 For example Nde what supposed there to be able to absolutely I'd say just return that we can 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:52.710
 First feeling that let's change something from us that are participating guess there are quite 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:06:02.600
 Matsuyama Festival last year, such as event reopening in Horinouchi and change of course 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.600
 We have a big interwar period 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:12.819
 How do you connect the history of this year Matsuyama Festival of the second year of renewal ? 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:17.650
 Amano will entrust the next generation 

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:22.820
 It is a hot heart 1 to the tradition and festival of 2 bowl town 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:26.840
 So good luck Cheer up please large Uu uhh 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:29.870
 I have already started practicing, but I go to see it every year 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:33.350
 That group day then the heat here 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:38.810
 When I actually go to visit and see it, it is transmitted through a very hard machine 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:42.840
 We also have seen but it is interesting I'm putting really'd Na' say Te festival Oh I'm in Kochi 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:46.320
 I also live in Yosakoi Festival because I have lived, but I am honest 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:51.000
 There are really many people in Yosakoi 

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:52.949
 I hope that Matsuyama Festival will do its best , but more like Amano-san is more 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.130
 If you increase more 

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:59.360
 Matsue Festival also shoulders the impossible festival 

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:59.360
 I wonder if it will be a festival
