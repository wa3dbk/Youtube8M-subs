 smartly I use humor despite 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.870
 to deal with very serious issues even 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.580
 transcendental discards through 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.590
 the narration of small stories and 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.840

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.970
 the presentation becomes more of a 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.399
 dialogue that in a monologue seasons its
