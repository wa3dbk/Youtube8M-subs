00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:08.740
 It is an eye training that enters 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:13.010
 The first act is a bench press 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:15.100
 It is 109 of the main set to what the insurgents are power 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:18.670
 Since the raw materials started 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:22.760
 About 100 kg has been made 4 reps all the time 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:25.860
 Clearly not a face with power down a little 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.090
 It's getting hot, but I can manage it today 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.620
 Yo 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.620
 I was able to get in 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:44.800
 Sometimes it's z eyes or 3 verses 10 trillion . 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.780
 In the wrench Place interval wit 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.220
 I'm doing it 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.860
 Doing English set is poor and raw 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.730
 If it does not turn 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.630
 In the feeling of lowering 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.630
 We do also 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.050
 The second white eye is the Inclined Dumbbell Bench Press 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.920
 It's a bit light with 20 kg of bars 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.970
 As to direct to the pectoralis major muscle conditions Bow use something a little lighter 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.970
 I am training 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.909
 I think it's too heavy 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:35.810
 It will be in the upper major chest muscle three colors 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.810
 We use the one above from the waist 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:01.470
 It is about the third kind Incline dumbbell 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:03.409
 We do how to 50 km 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:08.100
 I am of 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:13.710
 I do not take light until I fit the dumbbell at the top 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:17.630
 As I go away there, the load will escape, so 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:20.320
 It is not asked until there or rather up between 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.320
 The Lower 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.409
 Here captures dying 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.409
 x body 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:35.020
 In the event of Sato Hitoshi 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:38.270
 This is a slightly lighter room 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.460
 I do it with a weight that I can control 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:45.160
 Anyway 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:48.630
 I had a slight pain in my ears and it was slippery to run away 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.630
 So here again leads 6 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.489
 There was a movement robi 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.650
 If it is a little sweet 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:03.540
 I 'm putting it back to Yu-Gi-Oh after this 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.540
 5 I was doing a set 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.160
 I'm waiting 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.160
 goo
