00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
access to my other muscles in my arm

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.330 
access to my other muscles in my arm
once<00:00:35.100> I<00:00:35.190> opened<00:00:35.550> up<00:00:35.640> this<00:00:35.850> area<00:00:36.469> okay<00:00:37.469> cool<00:00:37.739> so

once I opened up this area okay cool so
you<00:00:38.399> are<00:00:38.940> demonstrating<00:00:39.090> how<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.629> use<00:00:39.750> the

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
you are demonstrating how to use the

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.920 
you are demonstrating how to use the
fashion<00:00:40.320> Lassa<00:00:40.500> on<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.190> forearms<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:42.420> he's

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
fashion Lassa on the forearms so he's

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.830 
fashion Lassa on the forearms so he's
got<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.410> in<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.800> middle<00:00:44.550> which<00:00:45.420> makes<00:00:45.690> it

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
got it in the middle which makes it

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.450 
got it in the middle which makes it
really<00:00:45.870> easy<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.379> do<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.710> arm<00:00:46.860> stop<00:00:47.160> doing<00:00:47.399> it

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
really easy to do the arm stop doing it

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.740 
really easy to do the arm stop doing it
for<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.610> second<00:00:47.879> because<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.149> is<00:00:48.300> really

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
for a second because that is really

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.020 
for a second because that is really
interesting<00:00:49.230> how<00:00:49.379> red<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.030> tell

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
arm feels like more access than I've

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.630 
arm feels like more access than I've
ever<00:01:03.780> had<00:01:03.899> before<00:01:04.100> like<00:01:05.100> do<00:01:05.280> your<00:01:05.430> grip

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
ever had before like do your grip

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.910 
ever had before like do your grip
strength<00:01:06.080> that<00:01:07.080> feel<00:01:07.260> better<00:01:07.470> than<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.770> did

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
strength that feel better than it did

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.480 
strength that feel better than it did
yeah<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.790> feels<00:01:09.000> more<00:01:09.180> accessible<00:01:10.159> but<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.189> can

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
yeah it feels more accessible but I can

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.210 
yeah it feels more accessible but I can
see<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.700> lot<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:12.470> muscle<00:01:13.470> activity<00:01:13.740> do<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.100> on

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
see a lot of muscle activity do it on

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.010 
see a lot of muscle activity do it on
this<00:01:14.369> one<00:01:14.580> because<00:01:14.729> basically<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.450> think<00:01:15.600> he

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
this one because basically I think he

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.780 
this one because basically I think he
jacked<00:01:16.320> up<00:01:16.470> his<00:01:16.619> forearms<00:01:17.009> from<00:01:17.250> gaining<00:01:17.490> too

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
jacked up his forearms from gaining too

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.550 
jacked up his forearms from gaining too
much<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.630> squeeze<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.170> one

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
much so squeeze that one

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.859 
much so squeeze that one
okay<00:01:20.130> I'll<00:01:20.400> squeeze<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:20.820> one<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.600> see<00:01:21.780> how

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
okay I'll squeeze that one you see how

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.830 
okay I'll squeeze that one you see how
much<00:01:21.990> more<00:01:22.320> muscle<00:01:23.159> access<00:01:23.549> he<00:01:23.729> has<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.270> then

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
much more muscle access he has and then

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.660 
much more muscle access he has and then
what<00:01:24.990> about<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.590> looseness<00:01:26.070> kind<00:01:26.580> of

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
what about the looseness kind of

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.070 
what about the looseness kind of
describe<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.060> difference<00:01:27.509> between<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.930> one

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
describe the difference between the one

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.660 
describe the difference between the one
you<00:01:28.200> blasted<00:01:28.650> versus<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.100> one<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.340> didn't

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
you blasted versus the one you didn't

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.429 
you blasted versus the one you didn't
lost<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:30.540> one<00:01:30.780> feels<00:01:31.170> more<00:01:32.960> mobility<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.290> I

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
lost this one feels more mobility and I

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.609 
lost this one feels more mobility and I
feel<00:01:34.650> like<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:34.950> can<00:01:35.220> just<00:01:36.000> an<00:01:36.840> overall<00:01:37.200> feeling

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
feel like I can just an overall feeling

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.950 
feel like I can just an overall feeling
of<00:01:37.860> moving<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.430> around<00:01:38.549> more<00:01:39.000> well<00:01:39.570> this<00:01:39.780> one

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
of moving it around more well this one

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.830 
of moving it around more well this one
feels<00:01:40.200> restricted<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.090> kind<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.240> what<00:01:42.689> about

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
feels restricted and kind of what about

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.010 
feels restricted and kind of what about
grip<00:01:43.079> string<00:01:43.320> tight<00:01:43.560> grab<00:01:43.950> me<00:01:44.299> and<00:01:45.299> then<00:01:45.810> grab

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
grip string tight grab me and then grab

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.609 
grip string tight grab me and then grab
me<00:01:46.170> on<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.350> other<00:01:46.439> one<00:01:47.840> yeah<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:49.110> really<00:01:49.350> is

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
me on the other one yeah that really is

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.190 
me on the other one yeah that really is
more<00:01:49.770> grip<00:01:50.009> strength<00:01:50.600> okay<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.810> how<00:01:51.930> long<00:01:51.990> did

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
more grip strength okay and how long did

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.929 
more grip strength okay and how long did
that<00:01:52.259> take<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.860> only<00:01:53.009> fascial<00:01:53.490> asset<00:01:53.790> there

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
that take you only fascial asset there

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.850 
that take you only fascial asset there
for<00:01:54.119> how<00:01:54.299> long<00:01:54.450> like<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:55.259> minute

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
for how long like a minute

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.100 
for how long like a minute
and<00:01:56.430> then<00:01:56.579> let's<00:01:56.790> check<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.149> like<00:01:57.570> smoothness

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
and then let's check the like smoothness

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.260 
and then let's check the like smoothness
lay<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.350> down<00:01:58.439> I'm<00:01:59.009> just<00:01:59.070> going<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.430> kind<00:02:00.210> of

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270
