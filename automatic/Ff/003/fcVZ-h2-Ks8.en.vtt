00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
glowing eyes that can be the puppet or

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.510 
glowing eyes that can be the puppet or
the<00:01:05.280> marina<00:01:05.729> because<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:06.659> sometimes<00:01:07.229> comes<00:01:08.159> to

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
the marina because it sometimes comes to

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.990 
the marina because it sometimes comes to
us<00:01:08.640> with<00:01:09.210> no<00:01:09.600> glowing<00:01:10.110> eyes<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.710> mean<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.820> real

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
us with no glowing eyes I mean the real

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.170 
us with no glowing eyes I mean the real
goals<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.659> this<00:01:13.229> puppet<00:01:13.799> is<00:01:13.950> unknown<00:01:14.490> so<00:01:14.939> it

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
goals of this puppet is unknown so it

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.020 
goals of this puppet is unknown so it
would<00:01:15.479> be<00:01:15.630> pretty<00:01:15.990> good<00:01:16.409> idea<00:01:16.860> for<00:01:17.189> Scott<00:01:17.549> to

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
would be pretty good idea for Scott to

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.570 
would be pretty good idea for Scott to
hide<00:01:18.270> this<00:01:18.540> character<00:01:19.110> but<00:01:19.320> still<00:01:19.650> leave<00:01:20.250> us<00:01:20.430> a

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
hide this character but still leave us a

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.810 
hide this character but still leave us a
clues<00:01:20.909> about<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:22.290> so<00:01:22.560> can<00:01:23.040> be<00:01:23.070> just

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
clues about that that so can be just

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.270 
clues about that that so can be just
random<00:01:24.299> dots<00:01:24.570> with<00:01:24.900> no<00:01:25.140> meaning<00:01:25.530> but<00:01:25.740> that's

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
random dots with no meaning but that's

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.030 
random dots with no meaning but that's
also<00:01:26.580> maybe<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.420> character<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.229> was<00:01:28.530> from

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
also maybe the character that was from

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.999 
also maybe the character that was from
almost<00:01:29.610> every<00:01:30.240> teaser<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:31.049> he<00:01:31.470> was<00:01:31.619> in<00:01:31.860> the

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
almost every teaser and he was in the

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.130 
almost every teaser and he was in the
back<00:01:32.250> being<00:01:32.850> unseen<00:01:33.360> but<00:01:33.570> controlling

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
back being unseen but controlling

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.069 
back being unseen but controlling
everything<00:01:34.770> if<00:01:35.369> that's<00:01:35.880> true<00:01:36.210> then<00:01:36.329> we<00:01:36.930> will

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
everything if that's true then we will

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.710 
everything if that's true then we will
see<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.560> puppet<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.130> then<00:01:38.159> new<00:01:38.820> five<00:01:39.420> nights

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
see the puppet and then new five nights

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.410 
at Freddy's 4 and it will control
everything<00:01:42.840> or<00:01:43.590> maybe<00:01:44.100> just<00:01:44.310> maybe<00:01:44.579> the

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
everything or maybe just maybe the

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.480 
everything or maybe just maybe the
puppet<00:01:45.689> will<00:01:46.409> be<00:01:46.649> controlled<00:01:47.130> by<00:01:47.430> someone

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
puppet will be controlled by someone

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.080
