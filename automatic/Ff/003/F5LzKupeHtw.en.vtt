figure out the exact sequence of all the

base pairs in the human genome

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.549 
base pairs in the human genome
they<00:00:41.579> could<00:00:41.760> cure<00:00:42.030> all<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.239> diseases<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:43.140> they

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
they could cure all the diseases so they

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.170 
they could cure all the diseases so they
started<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.010> human<00:00:44.280> genome<00:00:44.610> project<00:00:45.090> and

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
started the human genome project and

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.910 
started the human genome project and
researchers<00:00:45.899> from<00:00:45.989> over<00:00:46.260> 20<00:00:46.649> countries

worked<00:00:47.430> for<00:00:47.640> 13<00:00:48.120> years<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.690> do<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.289> when

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
worked for 13 years to do it and when

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.040 
worked for 13 years to do it and when
they<00:00:49.890> were<00:00:49.950> done<00:00:50.370> they<00:00:50.940> sat<00:00:51.239> back<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.899> were

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
they were done they sat back and were

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.700 
they were done they sat back and were
like<00:00:52.910> because<00:00:53.910> don't<00:00:54.719> get<00:00:54.809> me<00:00:54.899> wrong<00:00:54.930> there

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
like because don't get me wrong there

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.529 
like because don't get me wrong there
were<00:00:55.829> surprises<00:00:56.520> there<00:00:56.789> but<00:00:57.090> they<00:00:57.360> were<00:00:57.420> a

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
were surprises there but they were a

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.319 
were surprises there but they were a
little<00:00:57.809> less<00:00:58.079> like<00:00:58.410> surprise<00:00:59.090> surprises<00:01:00.090> and

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
little less like surprise surprises and

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.210 
little less like surprise surprises and
more<00:01:00.510> like<00:01:00.750> Oh<00:01:01.940> didn't<00:01:02.940> expect<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:04.170> kind<00:01:05.070> of

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
more like Oh didn't expect that kind of

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.100 
more like Oh didn't expect that kind of
surprises<00:01:05.760> first<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.360> turns<00:01:06.630> out<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:06.990> the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
surprises first it turns out that the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.800 
surprises first it turns out that the
