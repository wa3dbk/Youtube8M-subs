black and dark intense color that it

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.770 
black and dark intense color that it
gives<00:03:02.950> me<00:03:03.129> but<00:03:03.370> if<00:03:03.459> you<00:03:03.489> prefer<00:03:03.700> gel<00:03:04.299> go<00:03:04.629> ahead

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:10.710 
and use that I just gel and glitter just
do<00:03:08.590> not<00:03:08.709> mix<00:03:09.040> so<00:03:09.640> it's<00:03:09.790> actually<00:03:09.909> a<00:03:10.239> little<00:03:10.480> bit

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
do not mix so it's actually a little bit

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.229 
do not mix so it's actually a little bit
harder<00:03:10.989> so<00:03:11.230> this<00:03:11.439> was<00:03:11.739> the<00:03:12.189> easiest<00:03:12.400> way<00:03:13.180> to

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
harder so this was the easiest way to

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.110 
harder so this was the easiest way to
apply<00:03:13.750> my<00:03:14.590> line<00:03:14.859> but<00:03:15.280> if<00:03:15.519> you<00:03:15.640> have<00:03:15.819> a<00:03:15.849> better

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
apply my line but if you have a better

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.059 
apply my line but if you have a better
option<00:03:16.299> go<00:03:17.049> ahead<00:03:17.260> and<00:03:17.500> just<00:03:17.739> do<00:03:17.890> whatever

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
option go ahead and just do whatever
