00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.850
 am back on the advice and on today 

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.689
 college islamic high school 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.720
 in Rotterdam 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:10.800
 the parents' evenings are here tonight 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.590
 advice and lecture is very sorry 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.450
 important that parental involvement 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.680
 well arranged at this school i go 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.560
 let's see how it works here 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.089
 and with everyone 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.339
 the parents' evening how are you doing so far 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:25.230
 great overall i have 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:26.189
 positive news compared to report 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.220
 a 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.289
 and it's nice to parents it strange 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.820
 figure that are going up yes sure 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.649
 compared to per hour thing it is 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.489
 difficult to talk to with outs about 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.680
 a child 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.480
 no that is not so bad no because you know the 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.250
 children che or of course very well and 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.269
 for me the children always have to 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.399
 along with the parents 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:46.140
 because we are talking about the child's child 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.300
 naturally we talk to the child 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.640
 because it's about him or her so me 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.199
 always find it very strange when there is 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.300
 the old talked and sang to the child 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.550
 is sitting on parent evenings now that she is at the 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.620
 side for as a teacher yes no than that 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.929
 you went to your parents yet 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.550
 yes you are the day of yesterday how is 

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:04.710
 now to put it on the other side 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.570
 from van 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.950
 to sit at the table yes look because it 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.689
 also not so long ago I said 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.159
 if I don't have the oldest, then I can 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.840
 propose 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.720
 to you why student feels especially 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.740
 if a parent comes with a loan and who 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.060
 balls oh what you have something yet 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.369
 don't tell your brother what she had 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.070
 clearly behind sometimes come one 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.549
 bit everything leg to my other how 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.549
 was the report 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.810
 act well to the day well after peace 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.990
 the past no beating just a moment k 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.000
 no no no each is in a surprise 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.300
 or not or that is not no surprises 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.240
 times the following may alert you if 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:47.270
 like it no longer good 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.730
 how were the figures to expectations 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.980
 but that good yes very very good yes yes 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.230
 period one was better 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.360
 period 2 slightly less but we know 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.860
 where it depends so you already have something 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.190
 bad news and parents are allowed 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.080
 tell or no actually bad news 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.330
 with one with a positive twist 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.490
 yes because of the number of students 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.290
 first period quite bad for and 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.790
 they have worked extremely hard to make it anyway 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:12.770
 to catch up 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:13.940
 what were his points for improvement? 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.660
 you remember that from the last time 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.830
 more and in part 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:22.100
 behavior amount can tell the green 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.600
 I'm going to laugh at this Duncan's temperament 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.550
 have been those parents know what a what 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.770
 there is certainly no play with their children 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.450
 sure you should of course as much as possible 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.080
 tell look the little things 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:37.430
 of course your look is not really 100% one 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:39.170
 heavy scam actions just nice in it 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.850
 the interest of the child you have something 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.550
 said little things to your mother 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.100
 where they found out tonight 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.870
 yes I have achieved a layer of paint I have 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.709
 did not ask to again 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.130
 seen 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:54.140
 equal rights of that sentence what is that 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.760
 for five this generation are actually 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.680
 a little you whisper the parents that 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.739

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.880

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.670
