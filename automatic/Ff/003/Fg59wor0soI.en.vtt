00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
it and tell you what I for but since the

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.680 
it and tell you what I for but since the
game<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.770> kind<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.370> weird<00:01:02.609> like<00:01:02.820> there's<00:01:03.510> this

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
game is kind of weird like there's this

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.310 
game is kind of weird like there's this
constant<00:01:04.250> noise<00:01:05.250> sound<00:01:05.850> that's<00:01:06.510> kind<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.900> I

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
constant noise sound that's kind of I

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.760 
constant noise sound that's kind of I
guess<00:01:07.470> it's<00:01:07.830> supposed<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.220> submit<00:01:08.430> water<00:01:08.880> but

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
guess it's supposed to submit water but

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.310 
guess it's supposed to submit water but
instead<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:11.040> just<00:01:11.100> made<00:01:11.580> my<00:01:11.820> first<00:01:12.630> recording

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
instead it just made my first recording

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.340 
instead it just made my first recording
horrible<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.040> full<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.610> this<00:01:15.060> when<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.689> so<00:01:16.020> I

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
horrible and full of this when I so I

yeah we start out usually the game in
this<00:01:26.060> Lobby<00:01:27.979> here<00:01:28.979> which<00:01:29.729> isn't<00:01:30.030> that

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
this Lobby here which isn't that

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
original this is random

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.340 
original this is random
calls<00:01:33.280> and<00:01:33.700> for<00:01:34.000> some<00:01:34.180> reason<00:01:34.210> Tim<00:01:34.840> Domhnall

it<00:01:38.110> might<00:01:38.260> be<00:01:38.470> because<00:01:38.740> the<00:01:39.010> game<00:01:39.160> is<00:01:39.340> copied

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
it might be because the game is copied

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.510 
it might be because the game is copied
from<00:01:39.790> pipers<00:01:40.330> I<00:01:40.600> wouldn't<00:01:40.990> exclude<00:01:41.260> that<00:01:41.650> but

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
you know make a little bit more

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.580 
you know make a little bit more
interesting<00:02:55.920> because<00:02:56.460> this<00:02:56.790> is<00:02:57.030> just<00:02:57.590> not

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
interesting because this is just not

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.370

this is free models like it wouldn't
surprise<00:03:52.380> me<00:03:52.620> if<00:03:52.920> this<00:03:53.190> is<00:03:53.250> frugal<00:03:53.610> tools<00:03:53.970> but

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
surprise me if this is frugal tools but

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.120 
surprise me if this is frugal tools but
yeah<00:03:54.510> I<00:03:54.750> guess<00:03:55.200> it's<00:03:55.350> a<00:03:55.470> nice<00:03:55.620> addition<00:03:55.920> to

kind of change your liquid not something
for<00:03:58.650> me<00:03:59.030> also<00:04:00.030> we<00:04:00.120> can<00:04:00.150> have<00:04:00.360> hats

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.020 

and<00:04:06.700> of<00:04:06.910> course<00:04:06.940> you're<00:04:07.330> not<00:04:07.420> optics

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
and of course you're not optics

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.760 
and of course you're not optics
and<00:04:09.600> again<00:04:09.980> no<00:04:10.980> change<00:04:11.670> on<00:04:12.120> the<00:04:12.540> terrain<00:04:13.440> or

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
and again no change on the terrain or

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.150 
and again no change on the terrain or
building<00:04:14.130> whatever<00:04:14.310> whatsoever<00:04:15.240> just<00:04:16.160> water

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
building whatever whatsoever just water

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.979 
building whatever whatsoever just water
and<00:04:17.340> if<00:04:17.609> you<00:04:17.730> don't<00:04:17.910> climb<00:04:18.209> fast<00:04:18.720> enough<00:04:18.959> you

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
and if you don't climb fast enough you

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.289 
and if you don't climb fast enough you
die<00:04:19.489> and<00:04:20.489> this<00:04:20.669> would<00:04:20.790> have<00:04:20.940> been<00:04:20.970> so<00:04:21.269> much

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
die and this would have been so much

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.220 
die and this would have been so much
better<00:04:21.480> if<00:04:21.840> that<00:04:22.230> if<00:04:22.680> the<00:04:23.540> if<00:04:24.540> the<00:04:24.600> TV<00:04:25.050> for

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
better if that if the if the TV for

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.470 
better if that if the if the TV for
example<00:04:25.650> became<00:04:25.770> an<00:04:26.070> action<00:04:26.430> and<00:04:26.639> a<00:04:26.790> nun

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
example became an action and a nun

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.159 
example became an action and a nun
church<00:04:28.020> and<00:04:28.350> the<00:04:28.500> entire<00:04:29.300> TV<00:04:30.300> is<00:04:30.510> fumbled<00:04:31.050> and

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
church and the entire TV is fumbled and

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:32.750 
church and the entire TV is fumbled and
how<00:04:31.320> to<00:04:31.380> try<00:04:31.710> to<00:04:31.770> survive<00:04:32.100> in<00:04:32.400> the<00:04:32.490> game<00:04:32.639> would

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
how to try to survive in the game would

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.129 
how to try to survive in the game would
have<00:04:32.880> been<00:04:32.970> so<00:04:33.150> much<00:04:33.210> better<00:04:33.300> this<00:04:33.840> is<00:04:33.900> just

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
have been so much better this is just

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:35.629 
have been so much better this is just
boring<00:04:34.560> I<00:04:34.800> don't<00:04:35.010> know<00:04:35.100> why<00:04:35.280> you<00:04:35.340> would<00:04:35.610> even

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
boring I don't know why you would even

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:37.310 
boring I don't know why you would even
bother<00:04:35.940> playing<00:04:36.330> this<00:04:36.510> game<00:04:36.750> when<00:04:36.990> it's<00:04:37.139> like

this it's really not that interesting
I'll<00:04:42.690> try<00:04:43.080> one<00:04:43.320> more<00:04:43.470> map<00:04:43.680> and<00:04:43.950> then<00:04:44.070> we<00:04:44.130> will

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
I'll try one more map and then we will

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.370 
I'll try one more map and then we will
see<00:04:44.490> make<00:04:45.150> a<00:04:45.180> conclusion<00:04:46.550> again<00:04:48.380> not
