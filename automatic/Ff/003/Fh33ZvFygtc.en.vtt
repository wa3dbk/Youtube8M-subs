00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
Punk retains the WWE title in a very

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.080 
Punk retains the WWE title in a very
surprising<00:00:22.010> match<00:00:23.010> first<00:00:23.609> of<00:00:23.760> all<00:00:23.850> I<00:00:23.910> thought

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
surprising match first of all I thought

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.240 
surprising match first of all I thought
the<00:00:24.180> match<00:00:24.330> would<00:00:24.480> be<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.720> main<00:00:24.869> event<00:00:25.250> but

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
the match would be the main event but

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.470 
the match would be the main event but
that's<00:00:26.369> besides<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.730> point<00:00:26.820> because<00:00:27.359> it

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
that's besides the point because it

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.630 
that's besides the point because it
really<00:00:27.630> did<00:00:27.900> build<00:00:28.170> AJ<00:00:28.619> as<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:29.070> face<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.279> bra

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
really did build AJ as the face of bra

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.870 
really did build AJ as the face of bra
for<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:29.970> past<00:00:30.230> month<00:00:31.230> maybe<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:32.579> I<00:00:32.700> thought

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
for the past month maybe and I thought

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.610 
for the past month maybe and I thought
they<00:00:33.030> would<00:00:33.059> have<00:00:33.360> her<00:00:33.630> big<00:00:33.870> payoff<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.500> I'm

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
they would have her big payoff and I'm

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.049 
they would have her big payoff and I'm
sure<00:00:34.829> there<00:00:35.070> was<00:00:35.219> supposed<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.550> be<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.760> payoff

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
sure there was supposed to be a payoff

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.020 
sure there was supposed to be a payoff
but<00:00:36.450> um<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:37.079> would<00:00:38.040> imagine<00:00:38.520> that<00:00:38.790> they're

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
but um I would imagine that they're

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.810 
but um I would imagine that they're
gonna<00:00:39.149> prolong<00:00:39.480> this<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.899> little<00:00:40.050> bit<00:00:40.230> more

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
gonna prolong this a little bit more

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.940 
gonna prolong this a little bit more
thus<00:00:41.820> making<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.570> match<00:00:42.780> now<00:00:43.230> instead<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.770> the

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
thus making the match now instead of the

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.139 
thus making the match now instead of the
main<00:00:44.100> event<00:00:44.280> because<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.640> swear<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.059> way

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
main event because I swear the way

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.819 
main event because I swear the way
they're<00:00:45.360> pushing<00:00:45.719> this<00:00:45.840> they<00:00:46.440> push<00:00:46.710> this

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
they're pushing this they push this

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.170 
they're pushing this they push this
harder<00:00:47.100> than<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.399> wrong<00:00:47.579> money<00:00:47.820> in<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:47.969> bank

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
harder than the wrong money in the bank

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.690 
harder than the wrong money in the bank
so<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:48.930> was<00:00:49.649> like<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:50.010> hundred<00:00:50.250> percent<00:00:50.460> sure

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
so I was like a hundred percent sure

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.010 
so I was like a hundred percent sure
that<00:00:51.000> this<00:00:51.090> was<00:00:51.270> going<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.480> be<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.719> main<00:00:51.870> event

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
that this was going to be the main event

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.520 
that this was going to be the main event
and<00:00:52.760> that<00:00:53.760> happened<00:00:54.690> but<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:54.960> match<00:00:55.140> was<00:00:55.350> good

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
and that happened but the match was good

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.860 
and that happened but the match was good
served<00:00:56.129> off<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.399> little<00:00:56.699> weird<00:00:57.329> because<00:00:57.629> they

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
served off a little weird because they

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.770 
served off a little weird because they
focused<00:00:58.260> more<00:00:58.410> on<00:00:58.469> AJ<00:00:58.949> but<00:00:59.760> i<00:01:00.030> was<00:01:00.539> saying

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
focused more on AJ but i was saying

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.599 
focused more on AJ but i was saying

table and Daniel Bryan got out of it and
they<00:02:03.060> were<00:02:03.119> both<00:02:03.299> at<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.600> top<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.229> back

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
they were both at the top and a back

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.219 
they were both at the top and a back
suplex<00:02:04.710> into<00:02:05.280> our<00:02:06.149> backdrop<00:02:06.600> but<00:02:06.930> everyone

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
suplex into our backdrop but everyone

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.790 
suplex into our backdrop but everyone
called<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.619> into<00:02:07.950> through<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.610> table<00:02:08.940> and

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.050 
called it into through the table and
this<00:02:10.800> is<00:02:11.009> where<00:02:11.190> I<00:02:11.220> thought<00:02:11.459> it<00:02:11.610> was<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.849> most

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
this is where I thought it was the most

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.080 
this is where I thought it was the most
undramatic<00:02:12.840> way<00:02:13.349> to<00:02:13.410> do<00:02:13.680> it<00:02:13.860> was<00:02:14.220> just<00:02:14.459> pump<00:02:14.849> in

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
undramatic way to do it was just pump in

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.559 
undramatic way to do it was just pump in
demand<00:02:15.480> 123<00:02:16.080> nothing<00:02:16.580> like<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:18.209> make<00:02:18.420> you

finish<00:02:40.290> and<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:41.489> payoff<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.910> this<00:02:42.239> because<00:02:42.360> we

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
finish and the payoff to this because we

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.960 
finish and the payoff to this because we
did<00:02:42.930> not<00:02:42.959> see<00:02:43.440> who<00:02:43.980> wages<00:02:44.340> gonna<00:02:44.519> end<00:02:44.670> up<00:02:44.790> with

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
did not see who wages gonna end up with

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.210 
did not see who wages gonna end up with
and<00:02:45.239> the<00:02:46.019> commentator<00:02:46.500> has<00:02:46.680> made<00:02:46.920> it<00:02:47.069> quite

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
and the commentator has made it quite

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.729 
and the commentator has made it quite
clear<00:02:47.310> that<00:02:47.580> aj<00:02:48.030> is<00:02:48.150> still<00:02:48.480> confused<00:02:49.050> as<00:02:49.290> she

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
clear that aj is still confused as she

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.259 
clear that aj is still confused as she
does<00:02:49.890> not<00:02:50.040> know<00:02:50.310> who<00:02:50.580> she's<00:02:50.760> going<00:02:50.910> to<00:02:51.000> go<00:02:51.090> with

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
does not know who she's going to go with

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.600 
does not know who she's going to go with
so<00:02:52.080> i<00:02:52.110> guess<00:02:52.440> this<00:02:52.620> is<00:02:52.739> going<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.010> go<00:02:53.190> on<00:02:53.370> till

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
so i guess this is going to go on till

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.800 
so i guess this is going to go on till
the<00:02:53.700> next<00:02:53.879> pay-per-view<00:02:54.150> which<00:02:54.660> is
