00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.790 

so<00:00:00.359> in<00:00:00.510> the<00:00:00.630> last<00:00:00.780> lesson<00:00:01.050> you'll<00:00:01.290> remember<00:00:01.530> we

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
so in the last lesson you'll remember we

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.039 
so in the last lesson you'll remember we
looked<00:00:01.949> at<00:00:02.190> reflection<00:00:02.700> method<00:00:03.149> now<00:00:03.899> we're

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
looked at reflection method now we're

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:05.450 
looked at reflection method now we're
going<00:00:04.170> to<00:00:04.290> be<00:00:04.380> looking<00:00:04.589> at<00:00:04.799> reflection

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
going to be looking at reflection

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.950 
going to be looking at reflection
property<00:00:06.000> which<00:00:06.210> I'm<00:00:06.390> sure<00:00:06.540> you<00:00:06.690> couldn't

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
property which I'm sure you couldn't

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.830 
property which I'm sure you couldn't
imagine<00:00:07.200> is<00:00:07.589> very<00:00:07.890> similar<00:00:08.450> so<00:00:09.450> if<00:00:09.510> we<00:00:09.660> just

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
imagine is very similar so if we just

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.860 
imagine is very similar so if we just
change<00:00:10.110> these<00:00:10.410> variables<00:00:11.010> and<00:00:11.570> delete<00:00:12.570> all<00:00:12.809> of

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
change these variables and delete all of

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.829 
change these variables and delete all of
this<00:00:13.139> for<00:00:13.410> now<00:00:13.940> now<00:00:14.940> what<00:00:15.089> we<00:00:15.210> need<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.389> do<00:00:15.630> is

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
this for now now what we need to do is

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.470 
this for now now what we need to do is
replace<00:00:15.990> this<00:00:16.560> which<00:00:16.890> was<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.400> method<00:00:18.119> name

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
replace this which was the method name

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.040 
replace this which was the method name
here<00:00:18.920> with<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:20.330> property<00:00:21.330> name<00:00:21.510> which<00:00:21.779> in<00:00:21.930> this

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
here with a property name which in this

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.859 
here with a property name which in this
case<00:00:22.260> is<00:00:22.439> going<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:22.740> be<00:00:22.800> data<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:24.570> just

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
case is going to be data and I just

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.490 
case is going to be data and I just
inserted<00:00:25.410> some<00:00:25.619> placeholder<00:00:25.920> data<00:00:27.349> so<00:00:28.349> now

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
inserted some placeholder data so now

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.830 
inserted some placeholder data so now
what<00:00:28.650> we<00:00:28.769> can<00:00:28.920> do<00:00:29.099> is<00:00:29.279> we<00:00:29.490> can<00:00:29.789> print<00:00:30.539> either

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
what we can do is we can print either

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.560 
what we can do is we can print either
class<00:00:31.590> methods<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.460> get<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.790> list<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.270> as<00:00:33.450> you

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
class methods to get a list and as you

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.139 
class methods to get a list and as you
can<00:00:33.719> see<00:00:33.930> there's<00:00:34.170> not<00:00:34.320> as<00:00:34.469> many<00:00:34.770> as<00:00:35.149> with

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
can see there's not as many as with

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.420 
can see there's not as many as with
reflection<00:00:36.989> method<00:00:37.350> but<00:00:37.829> they're<00:00:37.980> still<00:00:38.190> all

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
reflection method but they're still all

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.900 
reflection method but they're still all
very<00:00:38.700> helpful<00:00:38.940> nonetheless<00:00:40.219> so<00:00:41.219> let's<00:00:41.550> play

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
very helpful nonetheless so let's play

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.420 
very helpful nonetheless so let's play
around<00:00:42.090> with<00:00:42.300> this<00:00:42.480> let's<00:00:42.899> say<00:00:44.270> echo<00:00:45.270> RP<00:00:46.430> get

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
around with this let's say echo RP get

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.330 
around with this let's say echo RP get
name<00:00:47.870> and<00:00:48.870> we're<00:00:49.110> going<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.350> get<00:00:49.440> data<00:00:49.739> since

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
name and we're going to get data since

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.270 
name and we're going to get data since
that's<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.850> name<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.360> property<00:00:52.280> we're

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
that's the name of the property we're

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.920 
that's the name of the property we're
going<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.610> skip<00:00:53.879> this<00:00:54.030> one<00:00:54.090> because<00:00:54.539> this<00:00:54.719> is<00:00:54.780> a

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
going to skip this one because this is a

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.810 
going to skip this one because this is a
little<00:00:55.350> bit<00:00:55.620> more<00:00:55.829> complicated<00:00:56.219> but<00:00:56.699> I'll

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
little bit more complicated but I'll

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.750 
little bit more complicated but I'll
look<00:00:56.940> at<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.120> later<00:00:58.190> same<00:00:59.190> with<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.550> same

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
look at that later same with the same

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.189 
look at that later same with the same
goes<00:00:59.910> with<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.270> is<00:01:01.230> public<00:01:01.739> obviously<00:01:02.250> this

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
goes with this is public obviously this

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.080 
goes with this is public obviously this
property<00:01:04.199> in<00:01:04.439> particular<00:01:04.710> is<00:01:05.070> private<00:01:05.640> is

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
property in particular is private is

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.330 
property in particular is private is
protected<00:01:06.720> sorry<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.890> we're<00:01:08.040> not<00:01:08.130> going<00:01:08.280> to

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
protected sorry so we're not going to

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.950 
protected sorry so we're not going to
get<00:01:08.490> anything<00:01:08.700> here<00:01:09.000> if<00:01:09.270> we<00:01:09.479> were<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.750> change

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
get anything here if we were to change

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.600 
get anything here if we were to change
it<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.290> is<00:01:10.439> protected<00:01:11.040> we're<00:01:11.250> going<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.520> get

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
it to is protected we're going to get

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.179 
it to is protected we're going to get
one<00:01:12.350> which<00:01:13.350> means<00:01:13.590> true<00:01:14.060> is<00:01:15.060> static<00:01:16.189> obviously

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
one which means true is static obviously

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.770 
one which means true is static obviously
that's<00:01:17.430> not<00:01:17.580> static<00:01:18.180> but<00:01:18.420> if<00:01:18.479> we<00:01:18.600> were<00:01:18.720> to

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
that's not static but if we were to

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.999 
that's not static but if we were to
change<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.320> like<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.070> cell<00:01:21.350> refresh<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.920> we

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
change it like the cell refresh and we

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.030 
change it like the cell refresh and we
get<00:01:23.159> true<00:01:23.430> let's<00:01:23.939> remove<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.710> what<00:01:25.710> else<00:01:25.860> do

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
get true let's remove that what else do

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.609 
get true let's remove that what else do
we<00:01:26.070> have<00:01:26.570> well<00:01:27.570> that's<00:01:27.810> about<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.560> we

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
we have well that's about it that we

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.609 
we have well that's about it that we
need<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.920> know<00:01:30.110> now<00:01:31.110> what<00:01:31.290> we're<00:01:31.409> going<00:01:31.530> to

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
need to know now what we're going to

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.249 
need to know now what we're going to
look<00:01:31.829> at<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.070> how<00:01:32.189> we<00:01:32.220> can<00:01:32.340> get<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.759> value<00:01:33.259> now

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
look at is how we can get the value now

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.830 
look at is how we can get the value now
you'll<00:01:34.500> see<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:34.740> if<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.070> just<00:01:35.310> get<00:01:36.240> value<00:01:36.600> and

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
you'll see that if I just get value and

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.260 
you'll see that if I just get value and
would<00:01:37.020> probably<00:01:37.200> need<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.700> print<00:01:38.700> our<00:01:38.909> this

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
would probably need to print our this

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.319 
would probably need to print our this
because<00:01:39.750> it's<00:01:40.049> actually<00:01:40.259> an<00:01:40.650> array<00:01:41.329> we're

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
because it's actually an array we're

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.260 
because it's actually an array we're
going<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.600> get<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.899> fatal<00:01:43.409> error<00:01:44.270> reflection

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
going to get a fatal error reflection

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.389 
going to get a fatal error reflection
exception<00:01:45.869> with<00:01:46.140> message<00:01:46.590> cannot<00:01:46.920> access

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
non-public member acme user data which

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.240 
non-public member acme user data which
means<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.890> visibility<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:52.920> the

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
means that the the visibility of the

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.730 
means that the the visibility of the
property<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:53.790> in<00:01:53.820> public<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:55.229> we<00:01:55.350> can<00:01:55.530> actually

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
property is in public so we can actually

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.139 
property is in public so we can actually
fix<00:01:56.219> this<00:01:56.540> we<00:01:57.540> can<00:01:57.689> say<00:01:57.899> our<00:01:58.200> P<00:01:58.439> set<00:01:59.280> accessible

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
fix this we can say our P set accessible

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.230 
fix this we can say our P set accessible
the<00:02:00.990> true<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.770> now<00:02:02.430> you'll<00:02:02.670> see<00:02:02.729> that<00:02:02.909> we<00:02:03.119> get

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
the true and now you'll see that we get

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.260 
the true and now you'll see that we get
another<00:02:03.570> error<00:02:03.890> and<00:02:04.890> this<00:02:05.490> is<00:02:05.640> because<00:02:06.000> gate

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
another error and this is because gate

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.320 
another error and this is because gate
value<00:02:06.540> expects<00:02:07.259> one<00:02:07.469> parameter<00:02:08.149> just<00:02:09.149> like

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
value expects one parameter just like

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.999 
value expects one parameter just like
with<00:02:09.509> our<00:02:09.539> reflection<00:02:10.229> method<00:02:10.560> we<00:02:10.709> need<00:02:10.830> to

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
with our reflection method we need to

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.830 
with our reflection method we need to
pass<00:02:11.220> in<00:02:11.489> an<00:02:11.640> object<00:02:12.270> of<00:02:12.480> the

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
pass in an object of the

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.390 
pass in an object of the
that<00:02:13.050> we're<00:02:13.140> trying<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.500> really<00:02:14.099> have

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
that we're trying to really have

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.960 
that we're trying to really have
retrieve<00:02:15.360> property<00:02:16.319> from<00:02:16.560> so<00:02:17.400> let's<00:02:17.610> do<00:02:17.940> that

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
retrieve property from so let's do that

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.940 
retrieve property from so let's do that
now<00:02:18.300> you<00:02:18.930> say<00:02:19.110> whose<00:02:19.349> new<00:02:19.590> Acme<00:02:21.110> user<00:02:22.110> and

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
now you say whose new Acme user and

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.070 
now you say whose new Acme user and
we'll<00:02:23.819> just<00:02:24.030> pass<00:02:24.420> this<00:02:24.750> in<00:02:25.050> down<00:02:25.590> here<00:02:25.890> and

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
we'll just pass this in down here and

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.520 
we'll just pass this in down here and
we'll<00:02:28.080> just<00:02:28.319> echo<00:02:28.650> pre<00:02:29.810> to<00:02:30.810> make<00:02:30.959> thin<00:02:31.170> slits

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
we'll just echo pre to make thin slits

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.369 
we'll just echo pre to make thin slits
on<00:02:31.680> niether<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.459> as<00:02:33.360> you<00:02:33.510> can<00:02:33.629> see<00:02:33.690> we<00:02:33.989> get<00:02:34.140> all

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
on niether and as you can see we get all

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.220 
on niether and as you can see we get all
of<00:02:34.620> this<00:02:34.879> data<00:02:35.879> that<00:02:36.120> we<00:02:36.360> said<00:02:36.660> in<00:02:36.840> our<00:02:36.959> user

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
of this data that we said in our user

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.500 
of this data that we said in our user
