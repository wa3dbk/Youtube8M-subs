00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.480
 new who terrarium and good we are going to 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.570
 do the free coins tutorial 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.160
 and good we go to the world of narnia 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.890
 which is the official world of our series 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.490
 and what we need to do this 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.670
 tutorial then it is something very basic as it is 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.870
 this little person ok 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.120
 we need to have these clamps these 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.070
 pincers and cable and play short plate 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.230
 shockey that's why we need to have 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.610
 this is good this character that 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.440
 we got in the dungeon after 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.730
 kill this electron ok 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.720
 well, what else do we need, nor are we 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:44.660
 little blocks we need this block 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.579
 of active stone we need some 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.500
 how many chests, preferably gold or 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.570
 copper shadow which are these are 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.690
 the gold chests we need very 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.270
 important a bird statue and that 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.329
 it's all guys and well come what 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:02.260
 we need to do is the active blocks 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:06.600
 they are made here 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:09.610
 until down they are here simply with 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.790
 then with stone or with yes with stone and 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.890
 with cable ok easy to do and good 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.600
 guys what are we going to do right now 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.640
 is that we're going to start with the tutorial 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.190
 which is very easy to do what are we going to do 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.990
 over here 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.530
 The first thing to do is a mini 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.530
 platform 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.900
 it does not matter if it's big small 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.150
 what matters is that for him it is 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.490
 of bird ok 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.480
 since this statue is very very 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.480
 important for this circuit 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.150
 and good right now what you do 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.150
 this 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.640
 This is all this and good once 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.460
 placed up here 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.780
 we grab our dams leite the 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.590
 we put here 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.340
 and we put them here 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:10.030
 let's put 4 ok ok now what is 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.030
 does it 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.220
 put the blocks and their assets 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.019
 well we are not going to remove this from here 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.530
 and right now what we are going to do is 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.710
 put the active blocks and 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.650
 I have here ready 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:37.370
 all all all all all that are not 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.370
 so many I will teach it in the small way 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.130
 internally we launched the 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.370
 the statue with all prices plate 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.790
 what are these 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.200
 and from there that's the lawsuit we're going to 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.730
 interlace with the active blocks ok 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.350
 now what is done is that they are placed 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.840
 one runs around here 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.820
 3 here you can place all the chests 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.910
 that you want but they have to be in the 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:05.100
 active walls ok now the next step 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.240
 it is in each block to place an object what 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:11.620
 that is, I can not put that in that block 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:14.859
 we can put 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.859
 in other 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.180
 this in another block with another chest and in 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.700
 the last box we are going to put the 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.379
 antorchitas ok in each chest has to 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.560
 have something in there if it's not going to 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:31.260
 work here good once or so 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:34.409
 missing a plate so fuck 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.489
 where I put them here we need to use 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:37.489
 one of these on this side 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.870
 and here is a little mistake guys 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.960
 this must be how they see 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.960
 but 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:57.379
 in the bird statue have to go 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.379
 connected to the but at the same time the lawsuit 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:02.639
 there it is ready and now it is ready 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.230
 our circuit right now that's done 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:08.150
 to guys then it activates from our 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.150
 circuit activando la ve 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.220
 23 and good as you can see we have a 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.710
 of chests 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.360
 but that is a lot of compressors 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.769
 it has to be gold or from these chests 

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.519
 of shade because they are the most money 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.519
 they are going to give us here 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:26.720
 once here we wait for you to 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.550
 fill all the inventory of chests 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.460
 It will not take so long if you have more 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.080
 chests obviously here I only put 31 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.490
 it broke because here you put it on 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.490
 then I only have two chests 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.449
 right now I'm going to do it so that 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:43.909
 can see let's break let's kill 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:45.470
 to the birds and right now look at what 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:50.300
 we can do 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:52.130
 is the chest dropped because I did not have 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.430
 nothing inside but right now the deposit 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.960
 this 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.390
 and I just filled all the 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.250
 inventory that offers good that 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.700
 we do once we have all these 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.150
 chests 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:08.680
 Well, very easy guys, we're going here 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:12.070
 to our little house and once here we talk 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:15.660
 with any of these god 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.660
 - obviously with the guide 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:21.560
 god we get with this for example and 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:25.669
 we give it to you in store once here 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:28.400
 as you can see here my inventory I have 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:30.740
 a gold coin I say 23 gold and one 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.670
 of silver ok now simply all the 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.560
 chests we sell them 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:37.260
 we sell we sell them we sell them 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.910
 we sell them and that's how we're going to 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.790
 get money was so what but 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:44.070
 super super ultra easy or this is 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.150
 nothing I do not expect you are liking the 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.700
 video if you liked the video like 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.689
 favorites and comment and right now 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:53.589
 You can see when I have 

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:55.799
 I have three platinum coins that each 

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:58.869
 Silver way is worth 100 gold that 

00:05:55.799 --> 00:06:00.639
 so that it is clear not because right now 

00:05:58.869 --> 00:06:02.860
 what we can do again then it is 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:04.989
 come here we can make more blocks 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.460
 this asset and obviously you can put 

00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:11.479
 more chests are 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.860
 now we put 1 2 and 3 and right now 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:15.430
 we are going to fill it much faster because 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:18.190
 we already have three chests ok 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:20.710
 and well, it's just waiting 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.730

 put in inventory this we can 

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:27.210
 do with the inventory completely empty 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:27.210
 to obviously earn a lot more money 

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:32.670
 and good good, good once 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:35.400
 we have filled food just 

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:38.270
 we kill the birds 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:40.500
 and we sell again the coffers ok guys 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.330

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:46.220
 tutorial that I bring you for now I'm going to 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:48.630
 keep going up I have enough then 

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:50.280
