00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:07.730
 this program is doing sponsored 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.730
 For the preferred my favorite 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.800
 walking through this sector I found this 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.930
 mint that shows that probably 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.150
 there were mint plantations in this 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.419
 sector and the entertaining thing about this is that 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.640
 cut a grass from the ground can you 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:32.279
 add much more flavor and much more 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.519
 aroma to the preparation that we are going to do 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.519
 then 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.520
 in this preparation we will use 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:47.700
 frozen clams 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.700
 fresh asparagus 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:54.110
 a turkey breast fillet 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:58.610
 what is the fat that is totally lean 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:02.470
 very low in cholesterol and of course a 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.470
 excellent taste then 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.890
 the peas frozen directly to 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.890
 boiling water 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.780
 then we hope that it just comes back to 

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:18.750
 boil the water again we remove them and 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.940
 we process them meanwhile we go to 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.010
 prepare skewers 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.740
 this we are going to cut we cut the 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:29.770
 asparagus only the heads 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.920
 and we continue cutting the asparagus until 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:36.420
 reach the hardest part that in this 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.420
 case we will not use it 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.979
 we light the fire 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.189
 what is the grace of the pea that 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.810
 besides having a lot of vitamin b1 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.280
 antioxidants and carbohydrates together with 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.710
 the asparagus that are very rich in 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.640
 iron let's make a delicious 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.360
 recipe to wait for our guests 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.520
 once the pan is well heated 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.260
 we simply add olive oil and 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.800
 these pay breasts totally 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.800
 frozen 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.450
 we simply put it directly on the 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.959
 arteries 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.909
 then quickly and with a toy 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.609
 low speed is very important that 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:20.590
 have a lot of power at low speed 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:24.350
 then we take the peas that already 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:27.830
 they served are ready 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:30.380
 and I'm going to put them like that 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.790
 just with the one that has just nerve 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.480
 very very hot because it 's easier 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.650
 get a homogeneous texture and so 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.610
 So much will help us have a 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.500
 delicious preparation 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.940
 while cooking is finished 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.870
 our turkey breast 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.870
 this is what we do 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:54.310
 we remove the peas and add a little 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:57.660
 of the water from the cooking itself 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.660
 a little sea salt 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:05.190
 we remove we turn the breast of 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:10.310
 turkey we're going to leave it on the table 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:10.310
 that's add olive oil 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.310
 sea salt 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.940
 and fresh pepper 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:22.660
 I quite like the aroma that leaves 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.270
 freshly cooked peas excess 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:30.020
 Pepper 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:33.120
 then we process at low speed 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.770
 what is the grace this preparation that 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.840
 will have very few calories to 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.580
 difference of a sauce that may have 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.260
 Saturated fats 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.200
 this is a sauce made in base 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:47.510
 exclusively vegetable carbohydrates 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.510
 vitamin b1 and of course antioxidants 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.750
 add asparagus on a pan 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.750
 pretty hot 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:01.940
 We cut the payment into very thick pieces 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.849
 what is the grace of asparagus and 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:11.110
 cook them raw directly on a 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:14.019
 hot pan 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.909
 remember that in addition to the aroma and 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:18.190
 true flavor of the asparagus 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:20.500
 we keep all the chlorophyll if we 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.440
 they set in a complete vegetable in green 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.630
 almost phosphorescent and when the grace 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.729
 this that keeps all its nutrients and 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.560
 vitamins inside plus eating 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:33.760
 something rich we are feeding us 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.620
 healthily we put out the fire and 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.729
 quickly what I'm going to do is 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:41.479
 cut some leaves 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:45.540
 of this mind that we get out there 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:47.700
 let's cut this mint very finely 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:50.970
 I'm ordering the leaves to make it 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:53.220
 easier to cut when we cut 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.980
 some vegetable so delicate and with so many 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.110
 stimulating and prebiotic properties 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.660
 as is the case with mint that is a 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.820
 excellent digestive is important not 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.400
 spend many times over the 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.680
 knife and along that is going to 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:11.580
 also allow not to leave the nutrients 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:15.120
 in the table but leave it in this 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:17.600
 case inside of the sauce we cut in 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:21.630
 cubes 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:24.460
 that is we add the mint 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:29.920
 to the sauce vetch 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:32.670
 uncover and with a spoon just 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.670
 we stir 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:40.580
 we have the asparagus then ready 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:43.310
 we put them on the table 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:46.490
 and what do I have here 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:49.160
 some skewers then while we put together 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:52.280
 These delicious brochetas I take advantage of 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:54.860
 to tell the important thing and the great 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.160
 amount of a peanut contained in the 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.160
 clams 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.110
 and of course the asparagus besides 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.800
 be both an excellent prebiotics 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:06.240
 so what is the way to do this 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:09.190
 we puncture the asparagus right by the 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:12.390
 medium and 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.390
 we put the meat 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.370
 once we have ready the 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:23.170
 skewers of payment and asparagus we are going to 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.170
 pour our sauce peas with mint 

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:33.649
 this already gives a spectacular aroma once 

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:36.039
 that we have ready the pea sauce and 

00:06:33.649 --> 00:06:39.849
 we can surprise our guests 

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:42.860
 with turkey breast skewers 

00:06:39.849 --> 00:06:44.809
 asparagus and to finish this 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.159
 delicious appetizer where we pretend 

00:06:44.809 --> 00:06:48.229
 surprise all our guests 

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:50.569
 I want to remind you of the properties of 

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:53.180
 this incredible recipe the vexa that is 

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:55.610
 very rich in antioxidant vitamin b1 and 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:58.279
 of course carbohydrates the asparagus 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:07:00.529
 It also gives us a lot of iron and 

00:06:58.279 --> 00:07:03.169
 course the turkey breast that is a 

00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:05.419
 very lean meat low in cholesterol and that 

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:08.199
 It certainly gives us a very protein 

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:08.199
 rich in energy
