00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:05.910 
scheme so it ended up taking a really

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.150 
scheme so it ended up taking a really
long<00:01:06.119> time<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.750> then<00:01:06.869> mother<00:01:07.050> nature<00:01:07.160> spawn

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.160

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
linebacker puts them in between these

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.179 
linebacker puts them in between these
guys<00:02:03.080> contain<00:02:04.080> this<00:02:04.229> defensive<00:02:04.680> tackle<00:02:05.100> and

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
guys contain this defensive tackle and

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.700 
guys contain this defensive tackle and
then<00:02:05.880> bring<00:02:06.150> this<00:02:06.270> guy<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.689> couple<00:02:06.900> yards<00:02:07.290> in

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
then bring this guy a couple yards in

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.009 
then bring this guy a couple yards in
placement<00:02:08.610> is<00:02:08.790> kind<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.269> important<00:02:09.750> on<00:02:09.869> this

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
placement is kind of important on this

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:12.140 
placement is kind of important on this
just<00:02:10.829> so<00:02:10.979> he<00:02:11.160> gets<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.370> right<00:02:11.579> blitz<00:02:11.820> angle

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
just so he gets the right blitz angle

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.030 
just so he gets the right blitz angle
and<00:02:12.299> you'll<00:02:13.140> see<00:02:13.260> he<00:02:13.350> comes<00:02:13.560> right<00:02:13.829> through<00:02:14.010> a

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
and you'll see he comes right through a

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.759 
and you'll see he comes right through a
gap<00:02:14.340> there<00:02:15.049> go<00:02:16.049> ahead<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.230> call<00:02:16.410> this<00:02:16.590> one

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
gap there go ahead and call this one

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.069 
gap there go ahead and call this one
more<00:02:16.920> time<00:02:17.120> and<00:02:18.120> I'll<00:02:18.209> put<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.450> set<00:02:18.750> up<00:02:18.870> to<00:02:18.989> the

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:19.079 
more time and I'll put the set up to the

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:20.569 
more time and I'll put the set up to the
splits<00:02:19.350> in<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.590> description<00:02:20.100> just<00:02:20.280> so<00:02:20.549> I

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:20.579 
splits in the description just so I

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:23.540 
splits in the description just so I
don't<00:02:20.610> repeat<00:02:21.150> it<00:02:21.180> again

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
don't repeat it again

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.330 
don't repeat it again
and<00:02:23.700> remember<00:02:24.090> placement<00:02:24.750> is<00:02:24.930> very<00:02:25.340> important

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
and remember placement is very important

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.760 
and remember placement is very important
as<00:02:26.720> you<00:02:27.720> see<00:02:27.870> sometimes<00:02:28.110> if<00:02:28.380> you<00:02:28.440> don't<00:02:28.590> place

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
as you see sometimes if you don't place

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.550 
as you see sometimes if you don't place
it<00:02:28.800> right<00:02:29.040> it<00:02:29.250> will<00:02:29.370> come<00:02:29.550> off<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.790> outside

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
it right it will come off the outside

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.750 
it right it will come off the outside
and<00:02:31.560> if<00:02:31.950> you<00:02:32.070> don't<00:02:32.250> move<00:02:32.370> them<00:02:32.550> at<00:02:32.640> all

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
and if you don't move them at all

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.810 
and if you don't move them at all
actually<00:02:33.030> it'll<00:02:33.540> also<00:02:33.690> send<00:02:34.050> in<00:02:34.140> a<00:02:34.230> B<00:02:34.410> gap<00:02:34.790> so<00:02:35.790> i

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
actually it'll also send in a B gap so i

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.370 
actually it'll also send in a B gap so i
guess<00:02:35.970> i<00:02:36.060> can<00:02:36.180> demonstrate<00:02:36.330> that<00:02:36.720> really

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
guess i can demonstrate that really

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.320 
guess i can demonstrate that really
quick<00:02:37.590> before<00:02:37.770> i<00:02:37.980> said<00:02:38.160> uh<00:02:38.190> PA<00:02:38.340> got<00:02:38.550> so<00:02:39.150> if<00:02:39.240> i

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
quick before i said uh PA got so if i

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.450 
quick before i said uh PA got so if i
were<00:02:39.450> to<00:02:39.570> set<00:02:39.720> it<00:02:39.840> up<00:02:39.930> just<00:02:40.170> like<00:02:40.380> this<00:02:40.710> he

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
were to set it up just like this he

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.610 
were to set it up just like this he
would<00:02:41.580> actually<00:02:41.760> come<00:02:42.390> through<00:02:42.420> well<00:02:43.320> i<00:02:43.350> guess

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
would actually come through well i guess

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.950 
would actually come through well i guess
ya<00:02:43.830> got<00:02:44.010> there<00:02:44.510> sometimes<00:02:45.510> so<00:02:45.630> if<00:02:45.720> you<00:02:45.810> leave

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
ya got there sometimes so if you leave

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.240 
ya got there sometimes so if you leave
him<00:02:46.110> out<00:02:46.200> there<00:02:46.230> he<00:02:46.500> will<00:02:46.650> come<00:02:46.860> through<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.130> B

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
him out there he will come through the B

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.950 
him out there he will come through the B
gap<00:02:47.400> so<00:02:47.880> again<00:02:48.180> we'll<00:02:48.360> just<00:02:48.480> do<00:02:48.570> it<00:02:48.600> one<00:02:48.900> more

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
gap so again we'll just do it one more

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:55.460 
gap so again we'll just do it one more
time<00:02:50.240> and<00:02:51.240> then<00:02:52.190> I<00:02:53.190> like<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.490> move<00:02:53.640> him<00:02:53.790> in<00:02:54.470> just

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
time and then I like to move him in just

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.540 
time and then I like to move him in just
to<00:02:55.590> be<00:02:55.680> sure<00:02:55.710> that<00:02:55.890> he's<00:02:56.130> going<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.370> come

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
to be sure that he's going to come

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.640 
to be sure that he's going to come
through<00:02:56.580> this<00:02:56.790> a<00:02:56.940> gap<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:57.440> we'll<00:02:58.440> go<00:02:58.560> ahead

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
through this a gap and we'll go ahead

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:59.810 
through this a gap and we'll go ahead
and<00:02:58.800> look<00:02:58.860> at<00:02:58.980> this<00:02:59.100> over<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.400> top<00:02:59.550> down<00:02:59.760> view

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
and look at this over the top down view

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.560 
and look at this over the top down view
and<00:03:00.300> I'll<00:03:00.900> explain<00:03:01.170> why<00:03:01.260> it<00:03:01.470> works<00:03:02.570> basically

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
and I'll explain why it works basically

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.570 
and I'll explain why it works basically
by<00:03:03.900> spreading<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.290> line<00:03:04.530> you're<00:03:05.310> making

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
by spreading the line you're making

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.610 
by spreading the line you're making
these<00:03:05.700> right<00:03:06.030> tackles<00:03:06.480> or<00:03:06.780> left<00:03:07.080> tackle<00:03:07.440> right

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
these right tackles or left tackle right

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.650 
these right tackles or left tackle right
tackle<00:03:07.980> you're<00:03:08.250> making<00:03:08.490> them<00:03:08.640> go<00:03:08.970> after<00:03:09.330> these

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
tackle you're making them go after these

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.350 
tackle you're making them go after these
