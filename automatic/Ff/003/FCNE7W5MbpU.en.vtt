the game like this the gameplay is going
to<00:02:06.600> get<00:02:06.689> repetitive<00:02:07.020> because

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
to get repetitive because

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.780 
to get repetitive because
as<00:02:07.840> not<00:02:08.229> very<00:02:08.440> good<00:02:08.680> the<00:02:08.920> enemies<00:02:09.280> are<00:02:09.310> very

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:09.790 
as not very good the enemies are very

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.990 
as not very good the enemies are very
repetitive<00:02:10.500> even<00:02:11.500> fitties<00:02:12.130> one-liners<00:02:12.700> get

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
repetitive even fitties one-liners get

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.970 
repetitive even fitties one-liners get
old<00:02:13.210> pretty<00:02:13.420> quickly<00:02:13.840> but<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.620> one<00:02:14.800> thing

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
old pretty quickly but the one thing

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.800 
old pretty quickly but the one thing
that<00:02:15.040> was<00:02:15.310> added<00:02:15.670> that<00:02:15.820> is<00:02:16.000> pretty<00:02:16.270> cool<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:16.600> I

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
that was added that is pretty cool and I

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.630 
that was added that is pretty cool and I
was<00:02:16.900> a<00:02:16.990> pretty<00:02:17.200> great<00:02:17.410> idea<00:02:17.830> is<00:02:18.310> that<00:02:18.370> there

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
was a pretty great idea is that there

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.220 
was a pretty great idea is that there
are<00:02:18.670> these<00:02:18.850> challenges<00:02:19.420> that<00:02:19.510> show<00:02:19.750> up<00:02:19.930> in<00:02:20.080> the

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
are these challenges that show up in the

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.780 
are these challenges that show up in the
