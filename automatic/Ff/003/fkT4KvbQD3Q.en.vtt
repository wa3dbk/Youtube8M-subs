probably<00:00:29.269> the<00:00:29.359> most<00:00:29.539> common<00:00:29.990> one<00:00:30.109> is<00:00:30.170> people

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
probably the most common one is people

that have gotten to trouble with a
three-way<00:00:32.449> switch<00:00:32.510> they're<00:00:32.989> trying<00:00:33.199> to

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
three-way switch they're trying to

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.810 
three-way switch they're trying to
replace<00:00:33.559> it<00:00:33.830> they<00:00:33.980> forgot<00:00:34.309> the<00:00:34.460> write<00:00:34.610> down

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
replace it they forgot the write down

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.370 
replace it they forgot the write down
how<00:00:35.059> it<00:00:35.120> was<00:00:35.239> connected<00:00:35.750> and<00:00:35.899> they<00:00:35.960> can't<00:00:36.200> make

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
how it was connected and they can't make

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.590 
how it was connected and they can't make
it<00:00:36.410> work<00:00:36.620> again<00:00:36.980> and<00:00:37.280> they<00:00:37.730> the<00:00:38.239> three-way

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
it work again and they the three-way

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.420 
it work again and they the three-way
switches<00:00:38.870> of<00:00:39.110> course<00:00:39.320> what<00:00:39.649> you<00:00:39.800> have<00:00:39.980> it<00:00:40.130> each

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
switches of course what you have it each

end<00:00:40.730> of<00:00:40.820> your<00:00:40.940> hallway<00:00:41.329> up<00:00:41.899> and<00:00:42.230> down<00:00:42.350> on<00:00:42.559> your

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
end of your hallway up and down on your

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:43.990 
end of your hallway up and down on your
stairs<00:00:42.980> so<00:00:43.250> that<00:00:43.280> you<00:00:43.430> can<00:00:43.550> turn<00:00:43.670> a<00:00:43.730> light<00:00:43.969> on

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
stairs so that you can turn a light on

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.530 
stairs so that you can turn a light on
or<00:00:44.450> off<00:00:44.660> from<00:00:45.469> each<00:00:45.829> location<00:00:46.309> right<00:00:46.700> so

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:47.540 
or off from each location right so

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.850 
or off from each location right so
really<00:00:48.050> when<00:00:48.170> you<00:00:48.320> break<00:00:48.530> it<00:00:48.680> down<00:00:48.800> to

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
really when you break it down to

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.560 
really when you break it down to
something<00:00:49.250> like<00:00:49.460> this<00:00:49.640> the<00:00:49.910> way<00:00:50.030> they<00:00:50.210> work<00:00:50.390> is

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
something like this the way they work is

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.650 
something like this the way they work is
quite<00:00:50.840> simple<00:00:51.260> here's<00:00:51.950> a<00:00:52.280> common<00:00:52.910> single<00:00:53.329> pole

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
quite simple here's a common single pole

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.840 
quite simple here's a common single pole
switch<00:00:53.960> so<00:00:54.800> this<00:00:54.949> demonstrates<00:00:55.219> the<00:00:55.640> power

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
switch so this demonstrates the power

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.510 
switch so this demonstrates the power
coming<00:00:56.329> in<00:00:56.530> ok<00:00:57.530> and<00:00:57.710> here's<00:00:57.920> the<00:00:57.980> switch<00:00:58.309> it

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
coming in ok and here's the switch it

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.650 
coming in ok and here's the switch it
either<00:00:58.640> is<00:00:58.879> off<00:00:59.300> or<00:00:59.930> on<00:01:00.440> so<00:01:00.980> if<00:01:01.129> it's<00:01:01.280> off<00:01:02.000> no

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
either is off or on so if it's off no

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.350 
either is off or on so if it's off no
power<00:01:02.899> is<00:01:03.020> going<00:01:03.260> to<00:01:03.350> the<00:01:03.440> light<00:01:03.590> on<00:01:04.180> power<00:01:05.180> is

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
power is going to the light on power is

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.790 
power is going to the light on power is
going<00:01:05.539> to<00:01:05.720> the<00:01:05.780> light<00:01:05.960> right<00:01:06.289> so<00:01:06.500> that's<00:01:06.619> just

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
going to the light right so that's just

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.250 
going to the light right so that's just
a<00:01:06.950> simple<00:01:07.100> single<00:01:07.670> pole<00:01:07.850> now<00:01:08.750> over<00:01:08.990> here<00:01:09.170> is<00:01:09.229> a

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
a simple single pole now over here is a

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.350 
a simple single pole now over here is a
three-way<00:01:09.710> same<00:01:10.430> deal<00:01:10.670> you've<00:01:10.909> got<00:01:11.090> the<00:01:11.210> power

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
three-way same deal you've got the power

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.289 
three-way same deal you've got the power
coming<00:01:11.689> in<00:01:11.960> on<00:01:12.140> the<00:01:12.380> hot<00:01:12.560> conductor<00:01:13.119> now<00:01:14.119> this

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
coming in on the hot conductor now this

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:16.300 
coming in on the hot conductor now this
switch<00:01:14.570> this<00:01:14.869> is<00:01:15.290> a<00:01:15.470> three-way<00:01:15.890> here<00:01:16.130> and

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
switch this is a three-way here and

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.560 
switch this is a three-way here and
that's<00:01:16.460> a<00:01:16.610> three-way<00:01:16.939> at<00:01:17.060> the<00:01:17.150> other<00:01:17.270> end<00:01:17.479> of

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
that's a three-way at the other end of

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.660 
that's a three-way at the other end of
the<00:01:17.659> hall<00:01:17.810> for<00:01:18.020> instance<00:01:18.380> right<00:01:18.530> so<00:01:19.310> right<00:01:19.490> now

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
the hall for instance right so right now

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.990 
the hall for instance right so right now
this<00:01:20.420> switch<00:01:20.720> is<00:01:20.900> in<00:01:21.049> this<00:01:21.200> position<00:01:21.820> so<00:01:22.820> it's

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
this switch is in this position so it's

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.270 
this switch is in this position so it's
up<00:01:23.210> power<00:01:23.990> is<00:01:24.110> coming<00:01:24.320> down<00:01:24.560> here<00:01:24.920> but<00:01:25.040> this

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
up power is coming down here but this

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.100 
up power is coming down here but this
switch<00:01:25.520> is<00:01:25.700> down<00:01:25.909> so<00:01:26.450> it<00:01:26.509> can't<00:01:26.750> get<00:01:26.930> to<00:01:27.020> the

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
switch is down so it can't get to the

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.590 
switch is down so it can't get to the
light<00:01:27.259> right<00:01:27.740> so<00:01:28.700> if<00:01:28.970> you<00:01:29.090> turn<00:01:29.240> this<00:01:29.450> switch

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
light right so if you turn this switch

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.630 
light right so if you turn this switch
up<00:01:29.930> power<00:01:30.439> can<00:01:30.710> travel<00:01:31.009> through<00:01:31.280> to<00:01:31.400> the<00:01:31.490> light

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
up power can travel through to the light

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.240 
up power can travel through to the light
now<00:01:32.390> you're<00:01:32.600> going<00:01:32.840> back<00:01:33.049> out<00:01:33.320> shut<00:01:34.040> that<00:01:34.189> off

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
now you're going back out shut that off

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.940 
now you're going back out shut that off
it's<00:01:34.700> gone<00:01:34.909> again<00:01:35.270> back<00:01:36.259> to<00:01:36.439> this<00:01:36.560> end<00:01:36.829> you

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
it's gone again back to this end you

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.550 
it's gone again back to this end you
want<00:01:37.070> to<00:01:37.189> turn<00:01:37.340> it<00:01:37.460> on<00:01:37.869> now<00:01:38.869> the<00:01:38.960> power<00:01:39.200> drops

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
want to turn it on now the power drops

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.899 
want to turn it on now the power drops
down<00:01:39.680> to<00:01:39.950> that<00:01:40.100> leg<00:01:40.340> these<00:01:40.579> are<00:01:40.729> called

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
down to that leg these are called

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.149 
down to that leg these are called
travelers<00:01:41.450> and<00:01:41.659> this<00:01:42.290> is<00:01:42.409> called<00:01:42.619> your<00:01:42.799> common

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
travelers and this is called your common

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.249 
travelers and this is called your common
screw<00:01:43.460> and<00:01:44.240> so<00:01:44.420> that's<00:01:44.600> where<00:01:44.840> people<00:01:45.020> get

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
screw and so that's where people get

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.530 
screw and so that's where people get
into<00:01:45.409> trouble<00:01:45.560> pull<00:01:46.520> out<00:01:46.700> that<00:01:46.909> switch<00:01:47.210> take

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
into trouble pull out that switch take

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.450 
into trouble pull out that switch take
off<00:01:47.720> the<00:01:47.899> wires<00:01:48.079> which<00:01:48.530> one<00:01:48.740> was<00:01:48.920> the<00:01:49.040> common

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
off the wires which one was the common

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.609 
off the wires which one was the common
well<00:01:50.270> on<00:01:50.390> a<00:01:50.420> three-way<00:01:50.810> switch<00:01:50.869> the<00:01:51.259> common

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
well on a three-way switch the common

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.649 
well on a three-way switch the common
conductor<00:01:52.159> the<00:01:52.759> common<00:01:53.149> terminal<00:01:53.509> is

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
conductor the common terminal is

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.960 
conductor the common terminal is
identified<00:01:54.320> it's<00:01:54.560> a<00:01:54.680> different<00:01:55.009> color<00:01:55.189> so

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
identified it's a different color so

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:57.850 
identified it's a different color so
this<00:01:56.149> is<00:01:56.299> probably<00:01:56.689> black<00:01:56.930> and<00:01:57.350> then<00:01:57.710> these

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
this is probably black and then these

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.340 
this is probably black and then these
two<00:01:58.100> will<00:01:58.220> be<00:01:58.369> brass<00:01:58.640> colored<00:01:59.270> and<00:01:59.750> usually<00:02:00.229> on

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
two will be brass colored and usually on

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.109 
two will be brass colored and usually on
your<00:02:00.380> switch<00:02:00.740> it's<00:02:01.399> like<00:02:01.520> a<00:02:01.549> single<00:02:01.969> pole

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
your switch it's like a single pole

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.420 
your switch it's like a single pole
switch<00:02:02.420> on<00:02:02.689> one<00:02:02.840> side<00:02:03.110> there's<00:02:03.409> two<00:02:03.710> terminals

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
switch on one side there's two terminals

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.010 
switch on one side there's two terminals
the<00:02:04.640> other<00:02:04.759> side<00:02:05.000> there's<00:02:05.240> another<00:02:05.270> the

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
the other side there's another the

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.139 
the other side there's another the
bottom<00:02:06.409> conductor<00:02:06.920> on<00:02:07.100> the<00:02:07.130> side<00:02:07.430> with<00:02:07.640> to<00:02:07.820> the

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
bottom conductor on the side with to the

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.479 
bottom conductor on the side with to the
bottom<00:02:08.509> terminal<00:02:08.929> is<00:02:09.019> usually<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.350> common<00:02:09.739> so

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
bottom terminal is usually the common so

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.040 
bottom terminal is usually the common so
that's<00:02:10.670> how<00:02:10.790> it<00:02:10.850> works<00:02:11.000> don't<00:02:11.150> try<00:02:11.390> that

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.290 

yeah<00:02:14.440> now<00:02:14.830> I<00:02:14.860> know<00:02:15.040> how<00:02:15.310> a<00:02:15.340> three-way<00:02:15.910> so<00:02:16.120> hits

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
yeah now I know how a three-way so hits

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.790 
yeah now I know how a three-way so hits
you<00:02:16.390> works<00:02:16.570> I<00:02:16.780> mean<00:02:16.810> it<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:17.200> other<00:02:17.320> way<00:02:17.500> yeah

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
you works I mean it the other way yeah

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.000 
you works I mean it the other way yeah
flip<00:02:18.670> that<00:02:18.820> one<00:02:18.880> up<00:02:19.180> switch<00:02:19.660> goes<00:02:19.900> out<00:02:20.110> we<00:02:20.290> run

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
flip that one up switch goes out we run

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.700 
flip that one up switch goes out we run
straight<00:02:21.280> to<00:02:21.400> this<00:02:21.490> way
