need<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.459> grease<00:02:35.730> them<00:02:36.319> so<00:02:37.319> the<00:02:37.410> dry

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
need to grease them so the dry

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.259 
need to grease them so the dry
ingredients<00:02:37.739> are<00:02:38.130> mixed<00:02:38.310> together<00:02:38.519> and<00:02:38.940> we're

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
ingredients are mixed together and we're

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:40.430 
ingredients are mixed together and we're
going<00:02:39.390> to<00:02:39.450> mix<00:02:39.569> it<00:02:39.750> into<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:40.080> wet<00:02:40.319> ingredients

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
going to mix it into the wet ingredients

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:49.570 
going to mix it into the wet ingredients
one

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.630 

Oh

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.760 

where<00:02:54.240> you<00:02:54.360> put<00:02:54.569> it<00:02:54.690> into<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:54.900> muffin<00:02:55.319> tray

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
where you put it into the muffin tray

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.980 
where you put it into the muffin tray
and<00:02:56.069> bake<00:02:56.550> its<00:02:57.090> again<00:02:57.330> we're<00:02:57.480> using<00:02:57.510> an<00:02:57.840> ice

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
and bake its again we're using an ice

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.050 
and bake its again we're using an ice
cream<00:02:58.020> scoop<00:02:58.230> it's<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:59.069> easiest<00:02:59.400> way<00:02:59.670> to<00:02:59.700> fill

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
cream scoop it's the easiest way to fill

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.730 
cream scoop it's the easiest way to fill
muffin<00:03:00.360> trays<00:03:00.569> but<00:03:00.870> you<00:03:01.020> can<00:03:01.170> use<00:03:01.260> a<00:03:01.290> spoon<00:03:01.590> if

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
muffin trays but you can use a spoon if

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:13.080 
muffin trays but you can use a spoon if
you<00:03:01.830> don't<00:03:01.980> have<00:03:02.130> one

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.030 

and<00:03:13.599> just<00:03:13.780> equally<00:03:14.170> divided<00:03:14.410> out<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:14.709> batter

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.320 

so<00:03:18.040> since<00:03:18.220> we're<00:03:18.340> using<00:03:18.370> oat<00:03:18.790> bran<00:03:19.060> these

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
so since we're using oat bran these

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.300 
so since we're using oat bran these
muffins<00:03:19.630> don't<00:03:20.020> rise<00:03:20.350> as<00:03:20.650> much<00:03:20.800> as<00:03:20.860> normal

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
muffins don't rise as much as normal

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.490 
muffins don't rise as much as normal
muffins<00:03:21.670> so<00:03:21.910> you<00:03:22.000> can<00:03:22.240> actually<00:03:22.600> fill<00:03:23.110> in<00:03:23.140> the

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
muffins so you can actually fill in the

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.380 
muffins so you can actually fill in the
muffin<00:03:23.800> tray<00:03:24.340> a<00:03:24.370> little<00:03:24.700> bit<00:03:24.790> higher<00:03:25.030> than

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
muffin tray a little bit higher than

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.420 
muffin tray a little bit higher than
normal<00:03:25.540> right<00:03:26.170> it's<00:03:26.410> not<00:03:26.530> going<00:03:26.710> to<00:03:26.770> go<00:03:27.280> up

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430
