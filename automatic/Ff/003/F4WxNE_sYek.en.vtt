taking a look at the cloth set first I

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.800 
taking a look at the cloth set first I
think<00:00:28.560> we<00:00:28.680> can<00:00:28.830> all<00:00:29.099> agree<00:00:29.130> that<00:00:29.760> so<00:00:30.210> far<00:00:30.510> all

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
think we can all agree that so far all

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.359 
think we can all agree that so far all
of<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:31.050> armor<00:00:31.320> sets<00:00:31.529> we've<00:00:31.740> been<00:00:31.920> looking<00:00:32.250> at

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.440 
of the armor sets we've been looking at
here<00:00:32.730> they<00:00:33.630> are<00:00:33.660> designed<00:00:34.649> just<00:00:35.579> very<00:00:35.910> true<00:00:36.270> to

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
here they are designed just very true to

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.540 
here they are designed just very true to
the<00:00:36.600> theme<00:00:36.840> of<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.020> expansion<00:00:37.380> very<00:00:37.920> savage

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
the theme of the expansion very savage

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.389

kind<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.329> primeval<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.530> primitive<00:00:40.770> in<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.250> way

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
kind of primeval and primitive in a way

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
and this cloth armor set definitely is

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.940 
and this cloth armor set definitely is
showing<00:00:45.149> those<00:00:45.390> signs<00:00:45.899> with<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.590> leather

out<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:50.039> like<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.610> Rope<00:00:50.879> type<00:00:51.420> design

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899

if<00:00:56.340> I'm<00:00:56.489> wrong<00:00:56.730> but<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:57.000> don't<00:00:57.300> think<00:00:57.480> we've

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
if I'm wrong but I don't think we've

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.680 
if I'm wrong but I don't think we've
seen<00:00:57.719> this<00:00:58.170> type<00:00:58.469> of<00:00:58.579> circlet<00:00:59.579> headwear<00:01:00.390> for

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
some time at least I don't think so it's

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.660 
some time at least I don't think so it's
nice<00:01:03.750> to<00:01:03.780> see<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.199> return<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.040> design<00:01:05.489> to

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
nice to see a return to that design to

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.000

in<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.450> in<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.810> bottle<00:01:34.500> viewer<00:01:34.710> at<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.979> time

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
the screen shot was taken because the

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.300 
the screen shot was taken because the
other<00:01:36.659> two<00:01:36.900> have<00:01:37.200> two<00:01:37.439> shoulders<00:01:37.829> but<00:01:37.979> I

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
other two have two shoulders but I

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.399
