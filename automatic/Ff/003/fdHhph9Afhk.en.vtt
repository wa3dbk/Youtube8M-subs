00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.899
 and then to know the teacher and in the ps 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:11.940
 I'm here with samsung galaxy note 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:14.370
 3,000 we will change places and the 4 4g 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.510
 on this side let's do the antuan test 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.960
 It's alright that Mark is the one before 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.720
 or anyone else does is exist there 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.939
 There are what the staff says let's start the 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.220
 Test while I'm talking about 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.619
 there is something that people say that the 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.840
 year both samsung manipulates the 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.579
 results all year round to earn more 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.350
 performance to say that the device 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:42.989
 of them is faster I do not know how much 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:47.520
 I like this very much the learned man who 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:52.649
 the acid test of the institute is the one 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.480
 is a quad core of 1.6 and the time I 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.180
 I have him I do not even remember but I think 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.050
 it's a quad core 1.9 if I'm not mistaken 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:04.409
 because that is the 4g the 3g is another one 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.330
 package 1.7 and 1.3 if I'm not mistaken if 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.310
 I do not lack personal memory 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.990
 We'll see you after digging. 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.970
 the tests here we will see the 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:17.040
 details of each phone for you 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.979
 I do not know if it was because I pressed it before 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.240
 but he s4 that he is a little more 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.680
 advanced a little faster but 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.869
 it does not mean that it is more 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.689
 quick on the scene in relation to the to not 3 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.640
 thousand 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:38.340
 let's go some more 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.250
 this is the same patience test 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.810
 staff who do the test of 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.460
 patience to take the test of 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.439
 performance of the devices is then I 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.090
 I told you I do not know if it influences 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.640
 by the device that already has a certain time 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.460
 I already have a program and everything 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:01.320
 more and this one is the new device still 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:04.020
 is however the seventh place was very 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.299
 still stirred 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.369
 I do not know if it influences then. 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.310
 that I needed why I 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.860
 needed to make a 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.250
 the seven factory in this appliance will be 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:20.080
 to put is to do the actual tests 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:23.930
 is the actual test in relation to the last three 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:28.130
 the robozinhos here he will enter now 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:35.000
 This is test 2d as it always is. 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:38.530
 fast very fluid the s4 here the test 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.360
 two of now also very fast fluid 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:48.920
 the fpso test speaks more or less 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:52.190
 How much are you getting here 3742 fps 43 46 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:03:05.510
 48 50 faithful if today when it will arrive 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:03:06.560
 here 24 28 30 32 31 33 33 fpf was the 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.920
 maximum here 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:14.170
 or s4 it is better in part 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:22.310
 graphic in 3d 100% 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:29.170
 he hit here 29 thousand 29,312 and that 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:31.600
 hit 21,000 21,558 I thought it was good 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.730
 Details 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.829
 let's go there with the details 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:40.519
 I'll try to get a little closer here. 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:50.299
 for you to see is in the details 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:55.209
 Come on, and I want to see is great. 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:04:03.139
 the two are not here รณ information 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:08.209
 the s4 running 4 4 2 how much point 37 44 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:14.980
 cut also an arm 7 320 ac the adriano 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:18.950
 for the s4 prouni weah 305 720p 1280 joined 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:22.010
 1080p 1920 full hd and hd the screen is 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.500
 Personal eight 12.3 cameras camera 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.830
 or 3 megapixels 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:30.800
 let's go memory memory two gigas for 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:33.259
 both ram memory is smaller and more or 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:37.099
 least 16 gigs for both is almost 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:38.360
 the same thing we go here for cpu that is 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:42.740
 important 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:46.759
 here we have a step from 300 to 1593 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:50.629
 megahertz or if 300 to 1.6 ghz serve and 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:55.969
 300 to 1890 1.9 gaza then was so 

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:57.979
 wrong so it's adrian 305 and 320 per 

00:04:55.969 --> 00:05:00.110
 that he is faster and he has the 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:03.259
 number of stitches per inch greater 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:06.229
 480 versus 320 but it is a very 

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:09.169
 Good, okay, the camera again. 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:11.750
 2.1 megapixels for both is too good 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:14.930
 the temperature up're almost hitting the 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:18.229
 cell 27.3 27.2 internal temperature 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.030
 because the temperature because the 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:23.120
 processor heats memory warms up one 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:27.259
 performance test he understood the 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:32.300
 android sdk old shantanu 18 here 4.3 

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:35.300
 is what the android version is there in 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.860
 19 4.4 This event has English 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.219
 This one is in Portuguese the person 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:42.289
 now i realize this talk android sdk 

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:46.219
 thinking that I have seen that it is different from 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:50.539
 another here nfc does not have both what 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:57.020
 The more we have here he has several 

00:05:50.539 --> 00:06:00.590
 temperature sensors do not have this 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:02.330
 relative humidity 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.699
 just does not have a temperature sensor that 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:07.580
 the s4 this one has four sensors 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:13.729
 but it's a complete cell phone 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:19.430
 o'neill 3 again 29 will do well 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:23.900
 close to you see 29,000 29,312 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:27.710
 ps4 21.558 for note 3 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:30.020
 I found it like that and not own 3 thousand 'ta' 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:34.370
 and 193 looks at his performance here in 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:36.080
 up're mine until I left here as was 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:39.020
 my 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:41.659
 a are different that shows models 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:43.729
 different understood the list showing s4 

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:47.509
 second but here he is second 

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:50.620
 showing her ultra and 193 in the first 

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:55.969
 g2 and is also a great device and the 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:58.819
 of lg that shows my s4 s4 

00:06:55.969 --> 00:07:01.370
 is in front of the s 4 standard is one 

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:02.900
 standard personal touch dial then this 

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:04.280
 here it is better for you to see 

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.710
 each one's score 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:09.349
 It's good if you liked osce jorginho. 

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:12.550
 Leave a message personal touch thank you 

00:07:09.349 --> 00:07:12.550
 see you later, the
