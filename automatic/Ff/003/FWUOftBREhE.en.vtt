 Hi, how about now I'm going to talk about 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.700
 this device that is called apm that is a 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.860
 Personal Microdermabrasion 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.290
 Microdermabrasion helps remove a 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.080
 surface layer of the skin eliminating 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:33.030
 wrinkles scars and acne spots 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.180
 at the same time oxygenates the skin to 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.559
 have a good circulation the pvd comes 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.250
 with this device that is the 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.250
 microdermabrasion 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.040
 he also brings a white record of 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.250
 training or you can use it to 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.620
 an ultra sensitive skin 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.590
 four blue discs for sensitive skin 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.150
 the two little ones are for the face and 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.150
 the two great overcome the body 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.430
 also includes two color discs 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.860
 green for a medium abrasion 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.390
 two chains a big one that is for the 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.390
 body and the other for the face 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.300
 Y 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.300
 a reviewable filter 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:24.409
 Y 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:26.920
 and its electric cable to connect 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.920
 Y 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.460
 what pm does is fight and oxygenate 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.860
 the skin removing all the cells 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:49.090
 dead with the small crystals that 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.090
 contain each disk 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:16.069
 to use the pm has to be the 

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:18.680
 face completely clean and dry for 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.620
 pass the pm by the face we have to 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.930
 think the skin with your fingers we should not 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.569
 spend more than twice in the same 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.319
 place they will notice how the skin sucks 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.549
 and sheds the surface layer 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.349
 avoid finding ourselves with eyes and 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.060
 preference using at night 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.730
 after you finished it 's your 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.159
 Microdermabrasion cleans your face with 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.010
 a pH balancer or you can also 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:44.419
 use doha water and apply your cream 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.819
 This is the moisturizer that will absorb 

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:49.489
 much more because withdrawing all 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.590
 impurities of your face the skin gets 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.620
 red but do not worry because it's going to 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:59.560
 disappear after a short time use the 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.560
 pm once a week or every 15 10 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.720
 how can you see finish the 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.360
 microdermabrasion and you notice some 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.519
 small crystal particles and cells 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.910
 dead bodies that remain in the filter and in the 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.910
 top 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.830
 I really liked this 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.900
 microdermabrasion because the first time 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.030
 that I used it I noticed how they came off 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.620
 bits of skin and in the part of the 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.680
 nose man points are generated 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.870
 black completely cleaned by removing 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.670
 most of the black spots but 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.030
 what I did not like is that in this part 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:03.810
 from the nose the pm of does not enter no 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:06.180
 suck this area but out of that I 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.160
 I liked it a lot more because I noticed how it 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.220
 gave off bits of skin on my 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.990
 face and if you want the pml in the little box 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.060
 information I'll leave the link where 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.680
 You can buy it just like I hope you 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.570
 I liked my experience with 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.760
 microdermabrasion is 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.190
 Microdermabrasion is not so aggressive 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.840
 like a chemical peel but it's going 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.090
 removing little by little all the 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.800
 dead cells do not forget to subscribe and 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.220
 comment and see you in the next
