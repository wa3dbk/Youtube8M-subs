00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.570
 will not die because this business is 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.530

 rope of the move and will take it 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:36.120

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:53.250

 It's true that you have to stay here a lot. 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.569

 You already know how it goes the best you already know how 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.729
