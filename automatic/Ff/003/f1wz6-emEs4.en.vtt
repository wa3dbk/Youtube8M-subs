00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:59.150
 yusb 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.460

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:16.630
 extension here we have a flash drive. 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:21.880
 inserted before expanding it with us 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:27.820
 infrared port control input 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:37.190

 beautiful surplus some with kamchatka well in 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:50.980
 In principle , all that was interesting so 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:54.020
 probably in the next video I will connect it 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:57.200

00:05:54.020 --> 00:06:01.150
 adapter no sockets for such a plug 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:04.300
 also no why next time 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:07.130
 connect check at the same time we test 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:09.650
 on power start descriptions 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:17.630
 in the description, see its characteristics 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:18.320

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:23.300
 2 2 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:25.690
 as I assured in my opinion so 2 RAMs and 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:30.260
 8 internal memory 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:33.880
 but the rest is basically seen like this 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:39.110
 The link to the product is also in the description, see 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:42.700
