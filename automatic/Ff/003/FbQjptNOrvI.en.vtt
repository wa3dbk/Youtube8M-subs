00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:14.350
 I also want to make a countryman at the request of this person 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:19.020
 It is a material introduction 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:19.020
 With the sped color of sanction paint 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.220
 Brown and black 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.390
 The color ones of Aguri example 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.160
 Matsuto 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:40.200
 I'll introduce you how to make this later. 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.750
 It is not in the image after, but the palette and puff 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.210

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.750
 Yes 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:49.630
 The year you use the part is cosmos 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:56.490
 How this time 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:56.490
 I can not use clay for a long time, but I'm sorry if I do not understand it 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:07.110
 It is a tiler, and the finished product is good 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:09.170
 Color the clay to 5 degrees color in the misery year 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.659
 do it 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:18.530
 Here 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:23.180
 Mix this it song the difference between chip cookies and country maam 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:30.010
 I tried to search by a little image 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:33.520
 There are a lot of things that each of these horses was about chocolate of chocolate chip 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:39.520
 Countryman is like this 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:41.060
 It looks like it's a round thing Once a round thing is built, right? 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.500
 After 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:50.400
 In the case of chocolate chip cookies, chocolate sticks out 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:54.260
 5I think there are places to see but country 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.040
 It's all inside, so thin 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.430
 I can see you 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.430
 Yes 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.409
 I feel like this 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.989
 Chochoco 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:13.700
 It is a round of clay colored in chocolate color 

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:17.349
 Mix it with ocher colored clay 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.349
 I will form like this 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.240
 There is a thick place 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.460
 There is a thin place 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.340
 I think you should make it uneven 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.540
 Phew 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.530
 So only the color 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.670
 I will speed up 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:39.890
 It's dark, not yellow, so it's not the same overall 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.120
 Because it was the same color 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.970
 Smile or something 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:50.630
