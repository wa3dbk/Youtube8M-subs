right there let's put the fish in a
pygmy<00:01:00.690> in<00:01:00.840> there<00:01:01.020> again<00:01:01.670> it's<00:01:02.670> testifier<00:01:03.120> this

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
pygmy in there again it's testifier this

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.179 
pygmy in there again it's testifier this
time<00:01:03.809> if<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:03.989> tap<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.409> he'll<00:01:04.769> he'll<00:01:05.040> be

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
time if you tap it he'll he'll be

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.240 
time if you tap it he'll he'll be
launched<00:01:05.640> into<00:01:06.330> orbit<00:01:06.770> or<00:01:07.770> at<00:01:07.830> least<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.130> to

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
launched into orbit or at least you to

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.800 
launched into orbit or at least you to
the<00:01:08.369> water<00:01:09.290> okay<00:01:10.290> that's<00:01:10.500> enough<00:01:10.740> fishing

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
the water okay that's enough fishing

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.190 
the water okay that's enough fishing
okay<00:01:12.810> now<00:01:13.369> then<00:01:14.570> there's<00:01:15.570> another<00:01:15.659> thing<00:01:16.049> you

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
okay now then there's another thing you

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.960 
okay now then there's another thing you
could<00:01:16.350> do<00:01:16.500> with<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.740> glue<00:01:16.950> if<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.640> put<00:01:17.850> the

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
could do with the glue if you put the

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.660 
could do with the glue if you put the
two<00:01:18.360> pygmies<00:01:18.720> in<00:01:18.750> there<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.619> launch<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.340> air

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
two pygmies in there you launch the air

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.719 
two pygmies in there you launch the air
launch<00:01:20.909> wanted<00:01:21.390> them<00:01:21.540> out<00:01:22.759> but<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:25.729> then

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
all the ones in the air in front well

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.330 
all the ones in the air in front well
see<00:01:40.920> this<00:01:41.040> iceberg<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.820> can<00:01:42.150> flick<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.360> pygmy

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
do that let's move the pygmy over here

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.880 
do that let's move the pygmy over here
if<00:02:32.970> you<00:02:33.150> make<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.480> Sun<00:02:33.660> bigger<00:02:33.870> ill<00:02:34.500> then

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
if you make the Sun bigger ill then

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.530 
if you make the Sun bigger ill then
they'll<00:02:35.430> make<00:02:35.700> one<00:02:35.730> two<00:02:36.360> pygmies<00:02:36.750> go<00:02:37.709> on<00:02:37.830> fire

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
they'll make one two pygmies go on fire

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.920 
they'll make one two pygmies go on fire
like<00:02:39.540> so<00:02:39.900> you<00:02:40.709> know<00:02:40.769> mountain<00:02:41.400> ISIL<00:02:41.930> that's
