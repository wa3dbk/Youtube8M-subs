basically<00:00:30.080> want<00:00:30.260> to<00:00:30.290> learn<00:00:30.470> how<00:00:30.650> to<00:00:30.680> do<00:00:30.920> a<00:00:30.950> mega

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
basically want to learn how to do a mega

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.550 
basically want to learn how to do a mega
spin<00:00:31.550> first<00:00:31.880> and<00:00:32.270> then<00:00:32.810> work<00:00:33.110> your<00:00:33.140> way<00:00:33.380> up<00:00:33.410> to

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:33.560 
spin first and then work your way up to

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.560 
spin first and then work your way up to
a<00:00:33.710> time<00:00:34.010> machine<00:00:34.160> and<00:00:34.580> then<00:00:34.940> basically<00:00:35.360> this

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
a time machine and then basically this

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.270 
a time machine and then basically this
is<00:00:35.720> a<00:00:35.750> no-handed<00:00:36.260> time<00:00:36.440> machine<00:00:36.770> by<00:00:36.950> hooking

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
is a no-handed time machine by hooking

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.100 
is a no-handed time machine by hooking
your<00:00:37.400> foot<00:00:37.700> underneath<00:00:38.420> the<00:00:38.540> head<00:00:38.720> tube<00:00:38.930> and

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
your foot underneath the head tube and

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.810 
your foot underneath the head tube and
somewhat<00:00:39.440> of<00:00:39.470> the<00:00:39.590> fork<00:00:39.950> and<00:00:40.070> an<00:00:40.220> angle<00:00:40.640> and

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
somewhat of the fork and an angle and

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.120 
somewhat of the fork and an angle and
basically<00:00:41.690> the<00:00:41.870> next<00:00:42.050> degree<00:00:42.470> of<00:00:42.650> that<00:00:42.830> is

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:43.130 
basically the next degree of that is

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.680 
basically the next degree of that is
being<00:00:43.430> able<00:00:43.550> to<00:00:43.699> pump<00:00:44.000> it<00:00:44.210> which<00:00:44.449> means

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
being able to pump it which means

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.570 
being able to pump it which means
basically<00:00:45.020> you<00:00:45.500> take<00:00:45.650> the<00:00:45.710> bike<00:00:46.010> you<00:00:46.250> lean<00:00:46.430> it

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:46.580 
basically you take the bike you lean it

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.640 
basically you take the bike you lean it
over<00:00:46.790> with<00:00:47.150> your<00:00:47.330> foot<00:00:47.570> and<00:00:47.809> that<00:00:48.379> will<00:00:48.500> create

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
over with your foot and that will create

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.950 
over with your foot and that will create
kind<00:00:49.100> of<00:00:49.190> a<00:00:49.309> bigger<00:00:49.550> circle<00:00:50.059> and<00:00:50.300> as<00:00:50.510> you<00:00:50.750> pull

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
kind of a bigger circle and as you pull

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.140 
kind of a bigger circle and as you pull
it<00:00:51.110> up<00:00:51.320> towards<00:00:52.070> you<00:00:52.190> what<00:00:52.670> that'll<00:00:53.000> do<00:00:53.120> is

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:53.150 
it up towards you what that'll do is

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.610 
it up towards you what that'll do is
that'll<00:00:53.420> actually<00:00:53.690> continue<00:00:54.350> the<00:00:54.470> momentum

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
that'll actually continue the momentum

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.549 
that'll actually continue the momentum
of<00:00:55.280> a<00:00:55.430> tight<00:00:55.640> circle<00:00:55.850> so<00:00:56.300> basically<00:00:57.019> going<00:00:57.350> in

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
of a tight circle so basically going in

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:59.140 
of a tight circle so basically going in
and<00:00:57.739> out<00:00:57.830> it<00:00:58.280> means<00:00:58.489> that<00:00:58.699> the<00:00:58.790> bike<00:00:58.970> will

00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.150 
and out it means that the bike will

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.820 
and out it means that the bike will
actually<00:00:59.510> gain<00:01:00.409> speed<00:01:02.260> to<00:01:03.260> keep<00:01:03.470> the<00:01:03.680> hook

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
actually gain speed to keep the hook

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.620 
actually gain speed to keep the hook
spin<00:01:03.949> consistent<00:01:04.729> you<00:01:04.850> probably<00:01:05.180> want<00:01:05.390> to<00:01:05.449> set

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
spin consistent you probably want to set

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.899 
spin consistent you probably want to set
your<00:01:05.780> pedal<00:01:06.170> going<00:01:06.740> back<00:01:06.950> towards<00:01:07.370> the

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
your pedal going back towards the

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.360 
your pedal going back towards the
chainstay<00:01:08.659> and<00:01:09.380> basically<00:01:09.740> that'll<00:01:10.040> keep<00:01:10.190> it

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:10.370 
chainstay and basically that'll keep it

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.950 
chainstay and basically that'll keep it
out<00:01:10.490> of<00:01:10.580> the<00:01:10.670> way<00:01:10.820> of<00:01:11.000> the<00:01:11.390> front<00:01:11.600> tire<00:01:11.780> from

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
out of the way of the front tire from

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.690 
out of the way of the front tire from
kicking<00:01:12.350> it<00:01:12.440> and<00:01:12.560> that<00:01:12.650> kind<00:01:12.799> of<00:01:12.920> thing<00:01:13.100> you're

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
kicking it and that kind of thing you're

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.100 
kicking it and that kind of thing you're
gonna<00:01:13.850> want<00:01:14.030> to<00:01:14.060> take<00:01:14.240> that<00:01:14.420> foot<00:01:14.600> that<00:01:14.960> you're

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
gonna want to take that foot that you're

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.420 
gonna want to take that foot that you're
spinning<00:01:15.470> into<00:01:15.590> that's<00:01:15.950> the<00:01:16.130> foot<00:01:16.310> you're

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
spinning into that's the foot you're

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
spinning into that's the foot you're
gonna<00:01:16.520> want<00:01:16.729> to<00:01:16.790> take<00:01:16.940> off<00:01:17.150> or<00:01:17.360> the

gonna want to take off or the

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.300 
gonna want to take off or the

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
bring it to the down tube and what

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.450 
bring it to the down tube and what
you're<00:01:27.200> going<00:01:27.320> to<00:01:27.410> do<00:01:27.560> is<00:01:27.740> actually<00:01:28.160> hook<00:01:28.430> it

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
you're going to do is actually hook it

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.580 
you're going to do is actually hook it
underneath<00:01:29.030> the<00:01:29.450> board<00:01:29.720> and<00:01:29.870> underneath<00:01:30.140> the

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
underneath the board and underneath the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.200 
underneath the board and underneath the
head<00:01:30.770> too<00:01:30.980> but<00:01:31.190> when<00:01:31.310> you<00:01:31.400> feel<00:01:31.580> it's<00:01:31.760> stable

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
head too but when you feel it's stable

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.210 
head too but when you feel it's stable
you'll<00:01:32.990> be<00:01:33.170> able<00:01:33.260> to<00:01:33.410> take<00:01:33.590> your<00:01:33.710> hands<00:01:34.070> off

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
you'll be able to take your hands off

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.550 
you'll be able to take your hands off
the<00:01:35.090> difficulty<00:01:35.750> of<00:01:35.840> actually<00:01:36.020> getting<00:01:36.470> this

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
the difficulty of actually getting this

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.750 
the difficulty of actually getting this
trick<00:01:36.830> down<00:01:36.980> is<00:01:37.220> you're<00:01:37.370> going<00:01:37.460> to<00:01:37.520> have<00:01:37.610> to

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760 
trick down is you're going to have to

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.640 
trick down is you're going to have to
build<00:01:37.970> a<00:01:38.090> lot<00:01:38.210> of<00:01:38.270> strength<00:01:38.540> into<00:01:39.320> your<00:01:39.410> foot

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
build a lot of strength into your foot

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.410 
build a lot of strength into your foot
and<00:01:39.830> your<00:01:40.010> ankle<00:01:40.040> as<00:01:40.430> well<00:01:40.640> it's<00:01:41.090> going<00:01:41.240> to<00:01:41.300> be

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
and your ankle as well it's going to be

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.640 
and your ankle as well it's going to be
kind<00:01:41.720> of<00:01:41.750> a<00:01:41.840> little<00:01:41.960> bit<00:01:42.140> awkward<00:01:42.320> at<00:01:42.620> first

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
kind of a little bit awkward at first

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.920 
kind of a little bit awkward at first
but<00:01:42.980> after<00:01:43.520> a<00:01:43.550> while<00:01:43.730> it'll<00:01:44.060> feel<00:01:44.390> completely

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
but after a while it'll feel completely

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.160 
but after a while it'll feel completely
natural<00:01:45.410> as<00:01:45.620> time<00:01:46.130> machine<00:01:46.630> as<00:01:47.630> you're<00:01:47.960> coming

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
natural as time machine as you're coming

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.600 
natural as time machine as you're coming
out<00:01:48.380> of<00:01:48.500> the<00:01:48.590> trick<00:01:48.860> you're<00:01:49.130> going<00:01:49.190> to<00:01:49.340> want<00:01:49.550> to

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
out of the trick you're going to want to

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.070 
out of the trick you're going to want to
just<00:01:49.820> come<00:01:50.000> out<00:01:50.090> and<00:01:50.240> switch<00:01:50.420> your<00:01:50.450> hand<00:01:50.810> space

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
just come out and switch your hand space

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.580 
just come out and switch your hand space
with<00:01:51.260> me<00:01:51.380> back<00:01:51.590> to<00:01:52.010> the<00:01:52.160> normal<00:01:52.610> grip<00:01:52.820> position

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
with me back to the normal grip position

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.780 
with me back to the normal grip position
once<00:01:54.590> you<00:01:54.710> get<00:01:54.860> the<00:01:54.950> hook<00:01:55.070> spin<00:01:55.220> dialed<00:01:55.700> you

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
once you get the hook spin dialed you

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.550 
once you get the hook spin dialed you
can<00:01:55.940> adapt<00:01:56.210> it<00:01:56.360> to<00:01:56.510> other<00:01:56.690> tricks<00:01:57.050> going<00:01:57.290> from

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
can adapt it to other tricks going from

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.650 
can adapt it to other tricks going from
front<00:01:57.830> to<00:01:57.920> back<00:01:58.010> wheel<00:01:58.460> and<00:01:58.760> actually<00:01:59.300> even<00:01:59.510> in

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
front to back wheel and actually even in

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.420 
front to back wheel and actually even in
two<00:01:59.870> decades<00:02:00.050> whoppers<00:02:00.740> and<00:02:00.950> those<00:02:01.070> kind<00:02:01.370> of

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
two decades whoppers and those kind of
