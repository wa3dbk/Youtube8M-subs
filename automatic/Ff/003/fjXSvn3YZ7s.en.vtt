the bright languages just been replaced
under<00:00:22.020> it<00:00:22.320> this<00:00:22.529> side<00:00:22.890> of<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.189> flexible<00:00:23.730> joint

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
under it this side of the flexible joint

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.390 
under it this side of the flexible joint
this<00:00:24.420> is<00:00:24.480> all<00:00:24.720> flexible<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:26.099> it<00:00:26.220> runs

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
this is all flexible and it runs

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.009 
this is all flexible and it runs
underneath<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.449> I'm<00:00:27.539> going<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.689> try<00:00:27.869> and

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
underneath and I'm going to try and

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.560 
underneath and I'm going to try and
follow<00:00:28.199> this<00:00:28.410> as<00:00:28.560> best<00:00:28.769> as<00:00:28.949> possible<00:00:29.570> that's

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
follow this as best as possible that's

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.639 
follow this as best as possible that's
what<00:00:30.779> it's<00:00:30.900> running<00:00:31.260> that<00:00:31.949> there<00:00:33.110> that<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.410> the

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
what it's running that there that is the

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.530 
what it's running that there that is the
fuel<00:00:34.890> tank<00:00:35.130> so<00:00:36.000> I'll<00:00:36.059> come<00:00:36.210> around<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.450> other

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
fuel tank so I'll come around the other

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.310 
fuel tank so I'll come around the other
side

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.520 

this<00:00:42.320> is<00:00:42.440> the<00:00:42.559> other<00:00:42.679> side<00:00:43.420> running<00:00:44.420> along<00:00:44.899> me

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
this is the other side running along me

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.849 
this is the other side running along me
down<00:00:45.769> under<00:00:46.339> and<00:00:46.699> again<00:00:47.420> this<00:00:48.170> is<00:00:48.469> the<00:00:48.620> fuel

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:48.859 
down under and again this is the fuel

00:00:48.859 --> 00:01:01.729 
down under and again this is the fuel
tank<00:00:48.890> here<00:00:49.929> okay<00:00:50.929> let's<00:00:51.260> go<00:00:51.409> underneath

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.320 

now<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:05.110> is<00:01:05.290> on<00:01:05.470> the<00:01:05.680> near<00:01:06.010> side<00:01:06.330> it's

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
now this is on the near side it's

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.070 
now this is on the near side it's
running<00:01:07.750> around<00:01:09.090> above<00:01:10.090> the<00:01:10.360> fuel<00:01:10.570> tank<00:01:10.840> here

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
running around above the fuel tank here

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.850 
running around above the fuel tank here
some<00:01:11.350> loops<00:01:11.619> it<00:01:12.369> loops<00:01:12.790> over<00:01:13.390> and<00:01:14.290> then<00:01:14.619> back

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
some loops it loops over and then back

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.710 
some loops it loops over and then back
down<00:01:14.890> again<00:01:18.030> now<00:01:19.030> this<00:01:19.210> is<00:01:19.360> the<00:01:19.509> Weiss

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
down again now this is the Weiss

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.639 
down again now this is the Weiss
intersection<00:01:21.119> all<00:01:22.119> right<00:01:22.270> there's<00:01:22.840> the<00:01:23.050> give

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
intersection all right there's the give

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.100 
intersection all right there's the give
you<00:01:23.740> some<00:01:23.920> idea<00:01:24.250> of<00:01:24.310> perspective<00:01:25.060> there's<00:01:25.869> the

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
you some idea of perspective there's the

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.639 
you some idea of perspective there's the
hub<00:01:26.350> this<00:01:26.950> is<00:01:27.159> running<00:01:27.430> upside<00:01:27.820> down<00:01:28.649> along

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
hub this is running upside down along

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:32.219 
hub this is running upside down along
there<00:01:29.860> and<00:01:30.450> joins<00:01:31.450> onto<00:01:31.659> the<00:01:31.840> white<00:01:31.990> piece

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
there and joins onto the white piece

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.609 
there and joins onto the white piece
here<00:01:32.530> if<00:01:33.039> I<00:01:33.250> get<00:01:33.310> to<00:01:33.670> that<00:01:33.700> angle<00:01:34.300> you<00:01:34.590> can<00:01:35.590> see

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
here if I get to that angle you can see

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.469 
here if I get to that angle you can see
the<00:01:35.979> pipe<00:01:37.350> running<00:01:38.350> up<00:01:38.500> there<00:01:38.710> you<00:01:38.920> see<00:01:39.479> and

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
the pipe running up there you see and

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.210 
the pipe running up there you see and
above<00:01:40.840> the<00:01:41.170> fuel<00:01:41.380> tank<00:01:41.619> which<00:01:41.830> is<00:01:41.979> like<00:01:42.190> a

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
above the fuel tank which is like a

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.320 
above the fuel tank which is like a
bulge<00:01:42.550> which<00:01:42.910> comes<00:01:43.210> down<00:01:43.450> here

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
bulge which comes down here

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.510 
bulge which comes down here
there's<00:01:46.330> the<00:01:46.479> other<00:01:46.600> way<00:01:47.220> there's<00:01:48.220> the<00:01:48.429> other

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
there's the other way there's the other

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.130 
there's the other way there's the other
one<00:01:49.390> plugged<00:01:49.660> in<00:01:49.869> there<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:51.399> it<00:01:51.550> runs

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
one plugged in there and it runs

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.440 
one plugged in there and it runs
directly<00:01:53.140> up<00:01:54.240> behind<00:01:55.240> the<00:01:55.450> tank<00:01:55.690> you<00:01:56.470> see

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
directly up behind the tank you see

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.559 
directly up behind the tank you see
above<00:01:58.450> the<00:01:59.229> prop<00:01:59.470> shaft<00:02:00.000> these<00:02:01.000> are<00:02:01.149> two<00:02:01.300> hand

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:01.569 
above the prop shaft these are two hand

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:05.160 
above the prop shaft these are two hand
brake<00:02:01.720> lines<00:02:02.880> again<00:02:03.880> big<00:02:04.360> bulge<00:02:04.659> out<00:02:04.899> for<00:02:05.079> the

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
brake lines again big bulge out for the

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.380 
brake lines again big bulge out for the
tank<00:02:05.409> so<00:02:05.649> that<00:02:05.829> the<00:02:06.070> tank<00:02:06.610> goes<00:02:06.850> above<00:02:07.119> the

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
tank so that the tank goes above the

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.830 
tank so that the tank goes above the
prop<00:02:07.810> shaft<00:02:07.840> like<00:02:08.290> this<00:02:08.530> okay<00:02:09.149> so<00:02:10.149> the<00:02:10.630> pipe

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
prop shaft like this okay so the pipe

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.120 
prop shaft like this okay so the pipe
runs<00:02:11.049> all<00:02:11.200> the<00:02:11.230> way<00:02:11.320> along<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:11.620> top<00:02:11.769> here

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
runs all the way along the top here

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.729 
runs all the way along the top here
which<00:02:12.610> can<00:02:12.850> be<00:02:12.970> fed<00:02:13.180> from<00:02:13.360> can<00:02:14.230> be<00:02:14.260> fed<00:02:14.530> from

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
which can be fed from can be fed from

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.690 
which can be fed from can be fed from
this<00:02:14.950> side<00:02:15.160> so<00:02:15.190> it's<00:02:15.549> quite<00:02:15.700> easy<00:02:16.829> now

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
this side so it's quite easy now

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.880 
this side so it's quite easy now
you<00:02:19.239> can't<00:02:19.510> see<00:02:19.750> it<00:02:19.840> up<00:02:19.959> there<00:02:21.030> it<00:02:22.030> continues

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
you can't see it up there it continues

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.309 
you can't see it up there it continues
comes<00:02:23.890> out<00:02:24.069> and<00:02:24.220> then<00:02:24.310> tens<00:02:24.640> 90<00:02:25.000> degrees<00:02:25.330> and

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
comes out and then tens 90 degrees and

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.699 
comes out and then tens 90 degrees and
basically<00:02:26.709> joins<00:02:27.040> on<00:02:27.330> to<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.510> offside<00:02:29.019> there

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
basically joins on to the offside there

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.790 
basically joins on to the offside there
now<00:02:30.459> run<00:02:30.730> inside<00:02:31.680> quickly

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.979 

good<00:02:35.800> suggestion<00:02:36.190> put<00:02:37.150> a<00:02:37.180> bit<00:02:37.390> cough<00:02:37.599> it<00:02:37.810> down

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
good suggestion put a bit cough it down

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.880 
good suggestion put a bit cough it down
over<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.349> car<00:02:38.590> picks<00:02:38.830> and<00:02:39.130> takes<00:02:39.430> just<00:02:39.519> nice

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
over the car picks and takes just nice

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.920 
over the car picks and takes just nice
inside<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:42.040> car<00:02:42.959> now<00:02:44.099> you<00:02:45.099> lift<00:02:45.340> these<00:02:45.519> two

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
inside the car now you lift these two

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.140 
inside the car now you lift these two
shields<00:02:46.930> these<00:02:47.380> are<00:02:47.470> just<00:02:47.650> plates<00:02:48.310> which<00:02:49.090> are

shields these are just plates which are

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.300 
shields these are just plates which are

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
precisely take the earth off of this lay

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.289 
precisely take the earth off of this lay
off<00:02:58.000> of<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.630> battery<00:02:59.549> these<00:03:00.549> two<00:03:00.790> plugs<00:03:01.060> just

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
off of the battery these two plugs just

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:04.800 
off of the battery these two plugs just
which<00:03:01.720> cotton<00:03:02.019> which<00:03:02.230> one<00:03:02.440> goes<00:03:02.560> in<00:03:02.769> which<00:03:03.810> and

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
which cotton which one goes in which and

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.120 
which cotton which one goes in which and
you<00:03:04.959> can<00:03:06.450> now<00:03:07.450> you<00:03:07.510> can't<00:03:07.870> unfortunately<00:03:08.290> now

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
you can now you can't unfortunately now

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.940 
you can now you can't unfortunately now
that<00:03:09.310> I've<00:03:09.400> put<00:03:09.760> the<00:03:09.880> tank<00:03:10.120> back<00:03:10.209> in<00:03:10.569> and

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
that I've put the tank back in and

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.759 
that I've put the tank back in and
clamped<00:03:11.950> it<00:03:12.480> before<00:03:13.480> what<00:03:13.720> you<00:03:13.750> can<00:03:14.019> do<00:03:14.200> is<00:03:14.319> how

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
clamped it before what you can do is how

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:19.740 
clamped it before what you can do is how
this<00:03:14.980> is<00:03:15.250> that<00:03:15.549> the<00:03:16.329> tank<00:03:17.370> flexes<00:03:18.370> down<00:03:18.750> along

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
this is that the tank flexes down along

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.210 
this is that the tank flexes down along
with<00:03:19.780> the<00:03:20.170> proctor<00:03:20.410> off<00:03:20.590> going<00:03:20.799> underneath

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
with the proctor off going underneath

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.640 
with the proctor off going underneath
here<00:03:21.430> the<00:03:22.090> tank<00:03:22.360> flexes<00:03:22.900> down<00:03:23.079> like<00:03:23.319> that<00:03:23.470> and

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
here the tank flexes down like that and

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.819 
here the tank flexes down like that and
flexes<00:03:24.280> down<00:03:24.459> like<00:03:24.700> that<00:03:24.910> so<00:03:25.680> what<00:03:26.680> it

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
flexes down like that so what it

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:28.949 
flexes down like that so what it
actually<00:03:26.859> does<00:03:27.250> this<00:03:27.639> drops<00:03:28.180> a<00:03:28.359> little<00:03:28.600> here

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
actually does this drops a little here

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.170 
actually does this drops a little here
which<00:03:29.410> gives<00:03:29.680> you<00:03:29.769> you<00:03:30.400> can<00:03:30.549> put<00:03:30.700> your<00:03:30.819> hand<00:03:31.000> in

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
which gives you you can put your hand in

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.199 
which gives you you can put your hand in
and<00:03:31.329> you<00:03:31.810> can<00:03:32.019> just<00:03:32.590> manipulate<00:03:32.739> the<00:03:33.400> the<00:03:34.000> new

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
and you can just manipulate the the new

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.920 
and you can just manipulate the the new
copper<00:03:35.200> piping<00:03:35.739> to<00:03:36.430> run<00:03:36.639> around<00:03:37.450> the<00:03:37.900> outside

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
copper piping to run around the outside

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.660 
copper piping to run around the outside
here<00:03:38.560> this<00:03:38.739> is<00:03:38.859> what<00:03:39.010> you're<00:03:39.130> trying<00:03:39.250> to<00:03:39.400> cover

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
here this is what you're trying to cover

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.210 
here this is what you're trying to cover
you're<00:03:39.910> trying<00:03:40.209> to<00:03:40.299> go<00:03:40.750> around<00:03:40.989> here<00:03:41.230> come

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
you're trying to go around here come

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.300 
you're trying to go around here come
along<00:03:42.519> here<00:03:42.880> and<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:44.530> why<00:03:44.709> is<00:03:44.769> basically

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
along here and the why is basically

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.430 
along here and the why is basically
underneath<00:03:45.760> there<00:03:45.940> the<00:03:46.060> y<00:03:46.239> joint<00:03:46.600> which<00:03:47.410> is

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
underneath there the y joint which is

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.840 
underneath there the y joint which is
from<00:03:47.739> the<00:03:47.829> single<00:03:48.130> line<00:03:48.310> coming<00:03:48.579> from<00:03:48.700> the

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
from the single line coming from the

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.150 
from the single line coming from the
front<00:03:49.350> so<00:03:50.350> obviously<00:03:50.709> this<00:03:50.829> will<00:03:50.950> clip

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
front so obviously this will clip

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.890 
front so obviously this will clip
straight<00:03:51.459> back<00:03:51.639> in<00:03:51.760> there<00:03:52.530> myself<00:03:53.530> click<00:03:54.069> and

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
straight back in there myself click and

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.120 
straight back in there myself click and
then<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:56.079> other<00:03:56.230> one<00:03:56.410> is<00:03:56.560> obviously<00:03:56.889> running

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
then the other one is obviously running

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.530 
then the other one is obviously running
around<00:03:57.459> here<00:03:58.389> and<00:03:58.680> then<00:03:59.680> down<00:04:00.239> close<00:04:01.239> to<00:04:01.420> the

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
around here and then down close to the

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.930 
around here and then down close to the
arch<00:04:01.750> underneath<00:04:02.410> as<00:04:02.650> possible<00:04:03.160> and<00:04:03.849> then

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
arch underneath as possible and then

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.300 
arch underneath as possible and then
connecting<00:04:04.359> on<00:04:04.480> so<00:04:04.840> I<00:04:05.400> hope<00:04:06.400> that<00:04:06.609> helps<00:04:06.940> and<00:04:07.239> I

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
connecting on so I hope that helps and I

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.789 
connecting on so I hope that helps and I
personally<00:04:09.310> did<00:04:09.579> it<00:04:09.700> by<00:04:10.630> taking<00:04:10.840> the<00:04:11.200> exhaust

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
personally did it by taking the exhaust

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:12.980 
personally did it by taking the exhaust
off

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990 
off

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.560 
off
as<00:04:13.110> you<00:04:13.230> can<00:04:13.380> see<00:04:13.590> and<00:04:13.920> the<00:04:14.100> rear<00:04:14.280> seat<00:04:14.550> out<00:04:14.760> and

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
as you can see and the rear seat out and

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.270 
as you can see and the rear seat out and
the<00:04:15.990> heatshield<00:04:16.200> you<00:04:16.620> will<00:04:16.800> need<00:04:16.950> to<00:04:17.040> take<00:04:17.160> the

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
the heatshield you will need to take the

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.960 
the heatshield you will need to take the
heat<00:04:17.430> shield<00:04:17.670> out<00:04:18.770> and<00:04:19.770> that's<00:04:20.010> a<00:04:20.370> little<00:04:20.820> bit

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
heat shield out and that's a little bit

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.460 
heat shield out and that's a little bit
what<00:04:21.180> looks<00:04:21.360> like<00:04:21.450> just<00:04:21.810> the<00:04:21.870> heat<00:04:22.020> shield<00:04:22.320> out

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
what looks like just the heat shield out

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.060 
what looks like just the heat shield out
and<00:04:22.650> the<00:04:22.710> exhaust<00:04:23.040> out<00:04:24.920> another<00:04:25.920> little

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
and the exhaust out another little

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.570 
and the exhaust out another little
safety<00:04:26.370> tip<00:04:27.530> maybe<00:04:28.530> a<00:04:28.650> good<00:04:28.830> idea<00:04:29.160> to<00:04:29.430> have

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
safety tip maybe a good idea to have

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.760 
safety tip maybe a good idea to have
some<00:04:29.880> spare<00:04:31.100> exhaust<00:04:32.240> clips<00:04:33.240> or<00:04:33.510> exhaust<00:04:34.290> nuts

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
some spare exhaust clips or exhaust nuts

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.220 
some spare exhaust clips or exhaust nuts
and<00:04:34.980> bolts<00:04:35.340> mine<00:04:36.270> are<00:04:36.390> pretty<00:04:36.570> clean<00:04:36.990> because

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
and bolts mine are pretty clean because

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:38.930 
and bolts mine are pretty clean because
I've<00:04:37.440> just<00:04:37.470> recently<00:04:37.830> repaid<00:04:38.700> all<00:04:38.850> the

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
I've just recently repaid all the

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.270 
I've just recently repaid all the
exhaust<00:04:39.300> from<00:04:39.840> the<00:04:40.080> midsection<00:04:40.740> all<00:04:41.100> the<00:04:41.190> way

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
exhaust from the midsection all the way

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.930 
exhaust from the midsection all the way
to<00:04:41.340> the<00:04:41.580> back

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.150 

the<00:04:44.940> heat<00:04:45.060> shield<00:04:45.300> comes<00:04:45.510> out<00:04:45.720> quite<00:04:45.960> easily

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
the heat shield comes out quite easily

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.010 
the heat shield comes out quite easily
once<00:04:47.160> you've<00:04:47.310> taken<00:04:47.520> the<00:04:47.850> exhaust<00:04:48.210> off<00:04:48.480> so

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
once you've taken the exhaust off so

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.920 
once you've taken the exhaust off so
it's<00:04:49.230> exhaust<00:04:49.560> off<00:04:49.770> first<00:04:50.040> then<00:04:50.250> heat<00:04:50.490> shield

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
it's exhaust off first then heat shield

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.960 
it's exhaust off first then heat shield
so<00:04:52.280> yeah<00:04:53.280> this<00:04:53.490> is<00:04:53.550> justin<00:04:54.120> or<00:04:54.500> newbie<00:04:55.500> on<00:04:55.980> the
