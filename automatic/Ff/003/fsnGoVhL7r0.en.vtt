that you told is to both of my pocket
keeping<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.020> mic<00:00:17.300> doesn't<00:00:18.300> work<00:00:18.420> because<00:00:18.750> we

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
keeping the mic doesn't work because we

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:27.800 
keeping the mic doesn't work because we
are<00:00:19.770> told<00:00:20.070> that<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:25.849> maximum<00:00:26.849> audio<00:00:27.599> gets

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
are told that the maximum audio gets

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.120 
are told that the maximum audio gets
absorbed<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.750> it<00:00:30.750> gets<00:00:31.170> blown<00:00:31.410> out<00:00:31.500> from<00:00:31.920> the

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
absorbed and it gets blown out from the

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.360 
absorbed and it gets blown out from the
speakers<00:00:32.520> so<00:00:33.450> actually<00:00:34.170> speaking<00:00:34.440> below<00:00:35.160> the

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
speakers so actually speaking below the

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.240 
speakers so actually speaking below the
this<00:00:36.059> way<00:00:36.300> doesn't<00:00:37.110> really<00:00:37.230> work<00:00:37.410> so<00:00:38.070> that's

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
this way doesn't really work so that's

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.520 
this way doesn't really work so that's
one<00:00:38.399> of<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.550> first<00:00:38.820> things<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:40.140> have
