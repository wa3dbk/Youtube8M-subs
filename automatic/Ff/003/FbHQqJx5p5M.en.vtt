yeah<00:00:00.210> yeah<00:00:00.750> k<00:00:00.989> Zuko<00:00:01.319> the<00:00:01.530> precursor<00:00:02.129> to<00:00:02.340> vector

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
yeah yeah k Zuko the precursor to vector

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.140 
yeah yeah k Zuko the precursor to vector
and<00:00:02.939> guess<00:00:03.149> which<00:00:03.780> at<00:00:04.410> first<00:00:04.850> cases<00:00:05.850> little

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
and guess which at first cases little

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.179 
and guess which at first cases little
ends<00:00:06.330> ago<00:00:06.569> thought<00:00:07.020> that<00:00:07.410> if<00:00:07.710> you<00:00:07.919> just<00:00:08.099> hold

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
ends ago thought that if you just hold

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.860 
ends ago thought that if you just hold
down<00:00:08.309> you'll<00:00:09.059> survive<00:00:09.210> everything<00:00:09.630> better

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
down you'll survive everything better

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.620 
down you'll survive everything better
but<00:00:10.650> it's<00:00:11.070> in<00:00:11.250> fact<00:00:11.429> you<00:00:11.670> just<00:00:11.700> hold<00:00:12.120> against

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
but it's in fact you just hold against

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.549 
but it's in fact you just hold against
the<00:00:12.719> current<00:00:12.929> at<00:00:13.139> which<00:00:13.259> you're<00:00:13.380> getting

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
the current at which you're getting

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.160 
the current at which you're getting
knocked<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:14.040> you<00:00:14.070> will<00:00:14.730> take<00:00:14.969> away<00:00:15.240> vectors

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
knocked and you will take away vectors

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.189 
knocked and you will take away vectors
or<00:00:16.440> units<00:00:16.890> of<00:00:17.010> knock<00:00:17.190> back<00:00:17.630> accordingly<00:00:18.630> they

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
or units of knock back accordingly they

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.230 
or units of knock back accordingly they
have<00:00:19.289> definitely<00:00:20.010> big<00:00:20.430> shadows<00:00:20.850> too<00:00:21.000> strong

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
have definitely big shadows too strong

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.939 
have definitely big shadows too strong
that<00:00:21.449> for<00:00:21.660> fleshing<00:00:22.080> out<00:00:22.140> that<00:00:22.350> discovery<00:00:22.769> and

that for fleshing out that discovery and

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.679 
that for fleshing out that discovery and

you saw many times that game Zuko was
going<00:04:45.430> up<00:04:45.520> getting<00:04:45.939> choice<00:04:46.210> grabs<00:04:46.599> and<00:04:46.780> really

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
going up getting choice grabs and really

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.029 
going up getting choice grabs and really
applying<00:04:47.229> a<00:04:47.319> lot<00:04:47.439> of<00:04:47.530> pressure<00:04:47.680> defects

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:48.039 
applying a lot of pressure defects

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:49.709 
applying a lot of pressure defects
before<00:04:48.340> Beck's<00:04:48.759> was<00:04:48.819> able<00:04:49.060> to<00:04:49.120> seal<00:04:49.419> the<00:04:49.569> deal

00:04:49.709 --> 00:04:49.719 
before Beck's was able to seal the deal

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:51.270

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
closed them out with that down here and

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.670 
closed them out with that down here and
it<00:04:52.090> seems<00:04:52.539> as<00:04:52.719> if<00:04:52.750> Zuko<00:04:53.169> is<00:04:53.289> using<00:04:53.590> the

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
it seems as if Zuko is using the

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.290 
it seems as if Zuko is using the
projectiles<00:04:54.129> primarily<00:04:54.639> as<00:04:54.849> an<00:04:54.969> approach
