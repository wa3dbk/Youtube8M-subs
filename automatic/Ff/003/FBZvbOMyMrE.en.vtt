because<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:42.510> this<00:00:42.600> kit<00:00:42.809> has<00:00:42.960> two<00:00:43.170> different

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
because of this kit has two different

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.720 
because of this kit has two different
flavors<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.800> must<00:00:43.980> get<00:00:44.129> white<00:00:44.280> grape<00:00:44.520> you

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
flavors that must get white grape you

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.160 
flavors that must get white grape you
make<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:45.270> one<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.660> then<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:45.960> make<00:00:46.079> the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
make that one and then you make the

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.360 
make that one and then you make the
pineapple<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.620> actually<00:00:46.860> get<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.039> do<00:00:47.160> two

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
pineapple you actually get to do two

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.100 
pineapple you actually get to do two
full<00:00:47.399> kits<00:00:47.820> in<00:00:47.969> this<00:00:48.090> one<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.450> then<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:48.930> think

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
full kits in this one and then I think

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.630 
full kits in this one and then I think
the<00:00:49.260> puzzle<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:50.039> mix<00:00:50.160> them<00:00:50.309> together<00:00:50.430> and

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
the puzzle is you mix them together and

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.369 
the puzzle is you mix them together and
what<00:00:51.210> flavor<00:00:51.449> will<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.750> get<00:00:51.899> I<00:00:52.020> think<00:00:52.230> that's

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
what flavor will I get I think that's

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:59.330 
what flavor will I get I think that's
the<00:00:52.500> puzzle<00:00:52.770> in<00:00:52.949> this<00:00:57.829> then<00:00:58.829> we<00:00:58.920> have<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.160> next

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
the puzzle in this then we have the next

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:08.109 
the puzzle in this then we have the next
kits<00:00:59.579> in<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.730> series<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.480> they<00:01:01.129> maji<00:01:02.129> maji

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:10.250
