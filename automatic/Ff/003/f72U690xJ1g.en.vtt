first<00:00:28.769> of<00:00:29.070> all<00:00:29.310> we<00:00:30.029> have<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.480> align<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.230> camera

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
first of all we have to align the camera

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.000 
first of all we have to align the camera
to<00:00:32.070> Center<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.910> blue<00:00:33.120> ball<00:00:33.329> at<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:34.010> moment

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
to Center the blue ball at that moment

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.400 
to Center the blue ball at that moment
the<00:00:35.790> first<00:00:36.090> photo<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.750> taken<00:00:38.420> as<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:39.930> can<00:00:40.140> see

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
the first photo is taken as you can see

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.869 
the first photo is taken as you can see
each<00:00:40.649> time<00:00:40.910> we<00:00:41.910> Center<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.629> blue<00:00:42.870> ball<00:00:43.110> on<00:00:43.410> the

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
each time we Center the blue ball on the

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.240 
each time we Center the blue ball on the
semi-transparent<00:00:44.879> circle<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.629> new<00:00:46.379> photo<00:00:46.739> will

be shot the simplest way to take the

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.810 
be shot the simplest way to take the
photos<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.960> keep<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.649> device<00:00:52.829> 20

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820

centimeters<00:00:54.510> away<00:00:55.050> from<00:00:55.440> us<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:56.000> start

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
centimeters away from us and start

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.860 
centimeters away from us and start
rotating<00:00:57.449> on<00:00:58.079> our<00:00:58.620> own<00:00:58.829> axis<00:00:59.670> to<00:01:00.420> complete

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
rotating on our own axis to complete

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.160 
rotating on our own axis to complete
every<00:01:01.379> lap<00:01:01.559> when<00:01:02.520> we<00:01:02.760> finish<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.600> first<00:01:03.809> lap

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
every lap when we finish the first lap

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.160 
every lap when we finish the first lap
we<00:01:04.979> should<00:01:05.220> check<00:01:05.519> some<00:01:05.820> reference<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.960> make

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
we should check some reference to make

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.270 
we should check some reference to make
sure<00:01:07.470> we<00:01:08.040> match<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.670> different<00:01:09.060> folders

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.450 

in<00:01:13.280> this<00:01:13.760> case<00:01:14.060> we<00:01:14.810> can<00:01:15.020> take<00:01:15.050> this<00:01:15.620> line<00:01:15.950> as<00:01:16.160> a

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
in this case we can take this line as a

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.840 
in this case we can take this line as a
reference<00:01:16.910> in<00:01:17.810> other<00:01:18.020> photos<00:01:18.530> it<00:01:19.040> can<00:01:19.460> be<00:01:19.610> the

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
reference in other photos it can be the

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.380 
reference in other photos it can be the
auras<00:01:20.210> on<00:01:20.360> line<00:01:20.860> even<00:01:21.860> though<00:01:22.340> the<00:01:22.790> match<00:01:23.000> is

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
auras on line even though the match is

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.050 
auras on line even though the match is
not<00:01:23.810> perfect<00:01:24.380> we<00:01:25.130> can<00:01:25.160> consider<00:01:25.820> it

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
not perfect we can consider it

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.010 
not perfect we can consider it
acceptable<00:01:27.130> this<00:01:28.130> little<00:01:28.550> deviation<00:01:28.970> will<00:01:29.840> be

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
acceptable this little deviation will be

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.580 
acceptable this little deviation will be
fixed<00:01:30.410> by<00:01:30.740> the<00:01:30.770> program<00:01:31.370> later

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.830 

another<00:01:37.590> technique<00:01:38.130> is<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:39.090> keep<00:01:39.330> the<00:01:39.570> phone

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
another technique is to keep the phone

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.490 
another technique is to keep the phone
in<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.500> steel<00:01:40.800> position<00:01:41.400> as<00:01:41.670> if<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.840> was<00:01:43.140> on<00:01:43.440> a

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
in a steel position as if it was on a

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.290 
in a steel position as if it was on a
tripod<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.420> then<00:01:45.420> rotate<00:01:46.110> around<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.680> phone

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
tripod and then rotate around the phone

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.630 
tripod and then rotate around the phone
this<00:01:48.300> way<00:01:48.600> is<00:01:48.900> a<00:01:48.960> little<00:01:49.560> bit<00:01:49.770> harder<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.490> do

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
this way is a little bit harder to do

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.520 
this way is a little bit harder to do
but<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.810> results<00:01:52.350> will<00:01:53.040> be<00:01:53.070> slightly<00:01:53.790> better

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
but the results will be slightly better

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.130 
but the results will be slightly better
now<00:01:55.530> we<00:01:56.100> need<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.460> make<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.970> second<00:01:57.510> lap<00:01:57.750> to

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
now we need to make a second lap to

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.190 
now we need to make a second lap to
capture<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.860> upper<00:01:59.220> part<00:01:59.600> we<00:02:00.600> have<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.990> keep

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
capture the upper part we have to keep

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.100 
capture the upper part we have to keep
the<00:02:01.410> phone<00:02:01.650> in<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.460> same<00:02:02.700> position<00:02:03.240> but

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
the phone in the same position but

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.520 
the phone in the same position but
turning<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.619> up<00:02:04.800> a<00:02:04.979> little<00:02:05.280> bit

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.380 

we<00:02:11.530> need<00:02:11.740> to<00:02:12.010> move<00:02:12.190> the<00:02:12.400> phone<00:02:12.670> slowly

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
we need to move the phone slowly

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.250 
we need to move the phone slowly
otherwise<00:02:14.250> a<00:02:15.250> warning<00:02:15.910> will<00:02:16.360> appear<00:02:16.390> to

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
otherwise a warning will appear to

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.140 
otherwise a warning will appear to
prevent<00:02:17.710> us<00:02:17.920> from<00:02:18.340> taking<00:02:19.060> blurry<00:02:19.390> photos<00:02:19.870> a

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
prevent us from taking blurry photos a

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.750 
prevent us from taking blurry photos a
good<00:02:22.150> scene<00:02:22.540> to<00:02:23.080> make<00:02:23.260> a<00:02:23.320> spherical<00:02:24.040> photos<00:02:24.520> is

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
good scene to make a spherical photos is

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.870 
good scene to make a spherical photos is
the<00:02:25.600> one<00:02:25.780> without<00:02:26.200> objects<00:02:27.160> close<00:02:27.520> to<00:02:27.760> the

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
the one without objects close to the

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.520 
the one without objects close to the
camera<00:02:29.340> they<00:02:30.340> should<00:02:30.580> be<00:02:30.760> at<00:02:30.940> least<00:02:31.110> 6<00:02:32.110> meters

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
camera they should be at least 6 meters

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.270 
camera they should be at least 6 meters
away<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.910> straight<00:02:34.270> object<00:02:35.100> especially<00:02:36.100> if

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
away the straight object especially if

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.380 
away the straight object especially if
they<00:02:36.520> are<00:02:36.640> close<00:02:36.970> can<00:02:37.750> look<00:02:37.960> like<00:02:38.140> this<00:02:39.390> once

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
they are close can look like this once

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.320 
they are close can look like this once
we<00:02:40.840> finish<00:02:41.260> this<00:02:41.500> lab<00:02:41.800> we<00:02:42.520> turn<00:02:42.790> down<00:02:43.120> the

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
we finish this lab we turn down the

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.090 
we finish this lab we turn down the
phone<00:02:43.600> and<00:02:43.900> we<00:02:44.530> capture<00:02:44.950> another<00:02:45.370> lab<00:02:46.710> once<00:02:47.710> we

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
phone and we capture another lab once we

phone and we capture another lab once we
finish<00:02:48.490> this<00:02:48.790> circle<00:02:49.330> we<00:02:50.140> turn<00:02:50.380> down<00:02:50.650> the

finish this circle we turn down the
phone<00:02:51.100> and<00:02:51.340> we<00:02:51.880> capture<00:02:52.300> another<00:02:52.780> one<00:02:53.400> we<00:02:54.400> have

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
phone and we capture another one we have

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.530 
phone and we capture another one we have
already<00:02:54.820> captured<00:02:55.360> most<00:02:56.110> of<00:02:56.380> our<00:02:56.620> photo<00:02:57.150> if<00:02:58.150> we

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
already captured most of our photo if we

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.440 
already captured most of our photo if we
stopped<00:02:58.870> here<00:02:59.380> we<00:03:00.130> would<00:03:00.310> obtain<00:03:00.520> a<00:03:00.970> photo

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
stopped here we would obtain a photo

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.800 
stopped here we would obtain a photo
with<00:03:01.870> two<00:03:02.170> empty<00:03:02.500> gaps<00:03:02.850> one<00:03:03.850> for<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:04.240> sky<00:03:04.510> and

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
with two empty gaps one for the sky and

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:13.900 
with two empty gaps one for the sky and
another<00:03:05.650> one<00:03:05.920> for<00:03:06.190> the<00:03:06.310> ground

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.810 

to<00:03:14.660> capture<00:03:14.870> the<00:03:15.260> sky<00:03:15.560> is<00:03:15.800> a<00:03:15.860> little<00:03:16.370> bit

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
to capture the sky is a little bit

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.270 
to capture the sky is a little bit
complicated<00:03:17.240> because<00:03:18.050> of<00:03:18.200> the<00:03:18.320> position<00:03:18.830> we

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
complicated because of the position we

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.470 
complicated because of the position we
have<00:03:19.460> to<00:03:19.490> take

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.570 

capturing<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.750> ground<00:03:26.050> has<00:03:26.680> two<00:03:27.070> problems

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
capturing the ground has two problems

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.990 
capturing the ground has two problems
the<00:03:27.850> first<00:03:28.840> one<00:03:29.110> is<00:03:29.380> that<00:03:29.830> since<00:03:30.520> we<00:03:30.850> are<00:03:30.970> very

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
the first one is that since we are very

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.840 
the first one is that since we are very
close<00:03:31.600> the<00:03:32.380> connections<00:03:32.980> will<00:03:33.460> be<00:03:33.490> very

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
close the connections will be very

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.420 
close the connections will be very
noticeable

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.100 

especially<00:03:37.430> if<00:03:37.820> the<00:03:38.150> floor<00:03:38.450> contains

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
especially if the floor contains

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.610 
especially if the floor contains
straight<00:03:39.710> lines<00:03:40.180> in<00:03:41.180> this<00:03:41.480> case<00:03:41.720> as<00:03:41.990> we<00:03:42.590> have

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
straight lines in this case as we have

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.680 
straight lines in this case as we have
soil<00:03:43.010> it<00:03:43.940> will<00:03:44.240> look<00:03:44.450> pretty<00:03:44.690> nice<00:03:46.300> the<00:03:47.300> second

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
soil it will look pretty nice the second

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.130 
soil it will look pretty nice the second
problem<00:03:47.960> is<00:03:48.320> that<00:03:48.830> our<00:03:49.370> feet<00:03:49.760> can<00:03:49.790> appear<00:03:50.480> in

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
problem is that our feet can appear in

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.400 
problem is that our feet can appear in
that<00:03:51.620> case<00:03:51.890> we<00:03:52.610> touch<00:03:52.850> back<00:03:53.270> and<00:03:53.540> then<00:03:54.230> we

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
that case we touch back and then we

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:03.360 
that case we touch back and then we
separate<00:03:54.890> the<00:03:55.070> camera<00:03:55.400> from<00:03:55.850> our<00:03:56.090> body

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.860 

if<00:04:03.900> we<00:04:04.900> turn<00:04:05.170> sideways<00:04:05.860> our<00:04:06.250> phone<00:04:06.790> it<00:04:07.510> will

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
if we turn sideways our phone it will

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.040 
if we turn sideways our phone it will
appear<00:04:08.319> this<00:04:08.709> image<00:04:09.160> to<00:04:09.970> remind<00:04:10.330> us<00:04:10.540> to<00:04:10.750> keep

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
appear this image to remind us to keep

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.009 
appear this image to remind us to keep
it<00:04:11.200> straight

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.990 

once<00:04:16.019> we<00:04:16.380> have<00:04:16.530> should<00:04:16.830> the<00:04:17.010> last<00:04:17.250> photo<00:04:17.580> is

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
once we have should the last photo is

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.979 
once we have should the last photo is
good<00:04:18.810> to<00:04:19.019> take<00:04:19.260> over<00:04:19.799> a<00:04:20.010> look<00:04:20.370> and<00:04:20.640> see<00:04:21.299> if<00:04:21.570> we

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
good to take over a look and see if we

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.250 
good to take over a look and see if we
have<00:04:22.019> forget<00:04:22.680> any<00:04:22.950> part<00:04:23.430> of<00:04:23.610> the<00:04:23.850> sphere<00:04:24.260> if

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
have forget any part of the sphere if

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.280 
have forget any part of the sphere if
this<00:04:25.590> happens<00:04:26.040> a<00:04:26.250> black<00:04:27.090> empty<00:04:27.600> space<00:04:27.900> will

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
this happens a black empty space will

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.350 
this happens a black empty space will
appear

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.589 

now<00:04:33.080> we<00:04:33.590> can<00:04:33.830> press<00:04:34.099> the<00:04:34.129> blue<00:04:34.610> button<00:04:34.639> to<00:04:35.449> end
