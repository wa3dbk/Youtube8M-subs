00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:12.639
 hi girls today i'm here to talk to you 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:17.360
 these brushes brand to kourou 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:21.189
 so here we have those for the face and 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.189
 here we have those instead for the eyes 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:29.509
 I bought these brushes on ebay 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:33.910
 arrive from Poland by registered mail 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:37.219
 it takes about 6 to 10 days 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.560
 they had arrived, I think, after more than ten 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:41.330
 days because in the early days of 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:45.890
 November then there were the holidays 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:49.850
 delayed start right away with 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.040
 tell you that the only thing they don't have a 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.620
 keep these brushes because they arrive 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.530
 with this if we want to call it 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.660
 plastic cap you see to cover 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:04.909
 the bristles so though if you look at the 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:09.350
 Quality in fact now there wanted 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:12.649
 talking you ca n't understand why you don't 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:16.520
 can understand however they have in the sector 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:21.709
 really very soft and this ad 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:23.420
 example those for the powder h55 nothing 

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:28.030
 year the soft sectors I am 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.030
 found and finding myself really well 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:36.090
 in fact I bought as many as 10 brushes vi 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.710
 it was a set of six that I had paid up 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.690
 around 46 euros 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:44.970
 then anyway I wanted to do to have a 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.930
 bel 7 so I bought some 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.220
 others 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:52.670
 spending about 70 euros with the 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.670
 Shipping fees 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.110
 while girls are really beautiful 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.610
 there is precisely this here for the figure that 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.770
 I was telling you that it is h55 then there is 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:09.470
 this other one that I use this 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.470
 also for the earth h 56 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.980
 then we have these that would be for the 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.480
 foundation that there is a smaller one 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:23.910
 h50 s 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:26.820
 see how this dish and then we have 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:30.180
 this is the same as the one it is 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.730
 more a little bigger h50 and this is possible 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.000
 use for the foundation or otherwise 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:39.630
 I use it for face powder and I am there 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:43.650
 really good then we have this one 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:47.100
 which is a bit thrown away for the blush 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:53.730
 pink bristles because i'm already 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:56.160
 using by a little h 21 this is that 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.690
 that is according to me the beauty of 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.030
 these brushes that despite in 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:06.030
 soft sector are also full bodied 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:09.200
 see the bristles as they are this too 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:12.329
 the blush, however, blushes them out 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.910
 very well I am finding myself very well 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:16.950
 then as regards these we have 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:21.959
 this way also for what the 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:29.500
 correction of the little ones is not seen here 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:31.510
 this is 66 h 60 h 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.030
 and this precisely to draw the 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.200
 corrector where we have small 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:41.170
 imperfections under the eyes anyway 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:45.280
 also close reason of the nose I mean 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:47.800
 I'm using it and this is what you see 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:52.540
 also this is always thin and at 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:55.390
 always the soft bristles though also 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:04:00.180
 compact and I like it a lot 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:02.770
 however, even when I stretch it 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.410
 however a nice brush is always evening 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:08.320
 the soft bristles therefore do not sting 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:12.130
 here if we want to say then then we have 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:15.329
 this is the one for eyeshadow 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.680
 to spread the eyeshadow that is so 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:19.900
 here it is almost now it will be a little 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:26.230
 polished because it was also used 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:28.690
 first, however, to show you how this works 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.190
 even in so many bristles this a little more 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.500
 compact of the others because rightly 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:37.180
 for the eyeshadow it must be not too much 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:46.740
 too soft to too much 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:46.740
 beautiful shape and this is h 70 these h70 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.280
 then we have these here who are here 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:05:01.320
 to fade we have it like that 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:05:01.320
 little ethical but like this and this is h80 

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:08.769
 this too is already used then 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:11.589
 It finally that this is okay 

00:05:08.769 --> 00:05:15.369
 the one more precisely the larger one for 

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:19.899
 fade that this sector is very soft 

00:05:15.369 --> 00:05:24.579
 and it works really well and this 

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:27.299
 is h 77 

00:05:24.579 --> 00:05:27.299
 Unfortunately 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:37.599
 finally we have this that for you liner 

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:40.029
 however you see that so thin 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:42.159
 very soft bristles and use also 

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:44.979
 with the eyeshadow to put on and apply them 

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:47.270
 both above and below the eyelid or even 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:50.840
 or even tested with 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:55.220
 us liner and gel one that ad 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:57.920
 example that of essence and does 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:04.280
 his work is also really good e 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:09.490
 this is h 85 even if you can't see it 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:12.440
 however that is nothing else to tell you 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.970
 I am finding myself well there is nothing else 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:19.220
 to be added 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:21.170
 I would recommend them to you because in my opinion 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.790
 they are quality then they are also cruelty 

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:25.550
 free therefore means that they have not been 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:27.940
 tested by animals for now 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:32.350
 industry bristles is not losing 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:32.350
 so they seem pretty good 

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:38.060
 nothing I highly recommend them 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.410
 I didn't really want to do this 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:44.830
 video that by the way in one of mine 

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:46.460
 first videos so excuse me a bit maybe 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:49.520
 emotion or maybe even some 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:52.010
 repetition however I hope 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.990
 really there is already useful to you 

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:55.700
 more than anything else because in my opinion if a 

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:57.850
 day you want to try it to buy 

00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:05.210
 that is this then my opinion 

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:07.340
 personal however trust me that I am 

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:09.700
 one of the beautiful brushes 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:12.700
 bristles are full-bodied 

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:14.980
 then anyway it's not like I'm not alone 

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:18.220
 there are still others now 

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:19.660
 I don't remember but there were for example 

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.730
 also that for the tongue foundation of 

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:23.680
 cat rai I did not know how to take so many 

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:27.760
 also because it is the first time there 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:31.720
 looking to buy so I said indeed 

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:33.490
 already that I took 10 but then maybe 

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:38.440
 further on 

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:42.010
 as I add you and nothing with 

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:44.050
 I greet you and send you a kiss if 

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:46.120
 you have questions for me 

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:48.580
 if you liked it if we were more murky 

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:50.700
 let me know hi guys a kiss hello 

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.700
