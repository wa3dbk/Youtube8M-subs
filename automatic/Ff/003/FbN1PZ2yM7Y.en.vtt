00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:09.300
 hi everyone leaving your feedback 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:12.059
 a site as the brand dot ru so want 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:16.650
 say I'm upset about this 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.900
 the original phone is this copy i 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.960
 upset that I bought the original 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.439
 phone for 25,000 rubles is me 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:29.130
 upset here we stand as if 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:32.969
 new system here we have what's here 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:37.760
 closer to the old system but i understand that 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.760
 on android I'm just playing people 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:45.180
 the screen is very bright what is here what is here 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:48.289
 they are almost nothing externally 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.289
 see the difference 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.149
 there are absolutely no external differences 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:03.840
 same as this one came to me in 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.500
 In principle, all phone cases 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.920
 the only minus is the camera here it is 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:15.720
 how very good quality you 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.820
 have the same autofocus itself sat in me 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.070
 how could it be enough but maybe someone 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.070
 may not be enough 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:26.840
 phone OSes fully enough 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:29.039
 go work faster does not slow down 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:34.380
 the only grieving is the delivery 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:38.850
 for too long it was somehow possible 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:42.200
 would quickly do on the internet in 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.200
 principle climb all shake everything is good 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.200
 toys 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:55.740
 so as for the internet here 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:59.409
 the internet is like a safari here 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.890
 the only thing some sites can 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:08.040
 long loaded for Russian encoding 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:08.040
 it seems to me that my boot is running 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:18.340
 Skirt we are on Android + design posting 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.080
 risks maybe i think install crank 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.720
 no additional opera or google 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.190
 chrome installed programs here 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:29.860
 a little well there standard gave instagram 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:32.019
 vkontakte google maps of his father 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.019
 installed games are me already all day 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:38.140
 installed see different toys 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:39.820
 battery what battery shows what if 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.150
 listen to music I don't know 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:46.150
 thirty seven hours video at 9 o'clock 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.850
 talk for 13 hours internet for 7 hours 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.350
 he has a pretty good battery 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.660
 I can explain it so that he has 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.640
 screen brightness 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.590
 set up here look here it is 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.850
 in the middle is the screen brightness if i 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:04.470
 better how powerful the screen is but 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.970
 In principle, all that's all my thanks 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.050

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.050
