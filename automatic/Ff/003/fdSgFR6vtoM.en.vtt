about<00:02:40.590> 20<00:02:41.310> minutes<00:02:41.640> passed<00:02:41.970> I<00:02:42.440> needed<00:02:43.440> to<00:02:43.560> cool

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
about 20 minutes passed I needed to cool

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:54.670 
about 20 minutes passed I needed to cool
this<00:02:44.190> konyaku<00:02:44.790> with<00:02:45.180> cold<00:02:45.540> water

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.809 

what's<00:02:55.680> this<00:02:57.769> emotion<00:02:58.769> I<00:02:58.950> have<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.280> check<00:02:59.489> is<00:02:59.730> a

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
what's this emotion I have to check is a

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.539 
what's this emotion I have to check is a
taste<00:03:00.590> finally<00:03:01.590> done

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
taste finally done

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:07.520 
taste finally done
look<00:03:03.120> at<00:03:03.299> this<00:03:03.769> can<00:03:04.769> you<00:03:04.799> see<00:03:05.040> this<00:03:05.930> wait<00:03:06.930> is

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
look at this can you see this wait is

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.960 
look at this can you see this wait is
this<00:03:07.920> really<00:03:08.220> when<00:03:09.209> you<00:03:09.360> cook<00:03:09.599> we<00:03:10.140> don't<00:03:10.170> think

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
this really when you cook we don't think

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:19.530 
this really when you cook we don't think
anyway<00:03:12.049> let's<00:03:13.049> check<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:13.680> taste

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:42.130 

we<00:03:20.140> really<00:03:20.650> want<00:03:20.830> this

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.320 

the<00:03:42.680> conclusion<00:03:44.230> this<00:03:45.230> is<00:03:45.290> not<00:03:45.830> Kanaka<00:03:46.610> the

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
the conclusion this is not Kanaka the

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.860 
the conclusion this is not Kanaka the
taste<00:03:47.660> is<00:03:47.810> not<00:03:48.020> so<00:03:48.290> good<00:03:48.890> not<00:03:49.580> so<00:03:49.760> bad

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:04:02.490 

maybe<00:03:53.870> the<00:03:54.740> score<00:03:55.100> is<00:03:55.450> 60<00:03:56.450> out<00:03:56.690> of<00:03:56.750> out<00:03:57.200> of<00:03:57.440> 100

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:12.020 

too<00:04:03.500> much<00:04:04.450> to<00:04:05.450> finish<00:04:05.690> this

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.229 

yeah

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.400 

maybe<00:04:18.019> I<00:04:18.560> mistook<00:04:19.400> the<00:04:20.239> amount<00:04:20.569> of<00:04:20.780> the<00:04:21.109> powder

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
maybe I mistook the amount of the powder

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:26.560 
maybe I mistook the amount of the powder
I<00:04:21.940> have<00:04:22.940> to<00:04:23.120> try<00:04:23.389> this<00:04:23.449> again<00:04:23.990> someday
