00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.460
 and 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:24.810
 despite mother seamstress and tiny 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.550
 I was with her and rummage through 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.380
 the pieces of the tofs and at the time 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.240
 it was real stuff it was disappointing 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.000
 it was damask finally I pull it done 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.590
 of real material and then I have 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.750
 my grandfather is a painter a 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.480
 artisan painter he was really doing his 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.270
 colors it's another character it's 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.129
 a man always a little macho 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.690
 but well I admit that I believe that I have 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.000
 started doing more or less but my 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.769
 weapons at home although they did not want 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.680
 that I follow him in the workshop if this 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:53.850
 is not a girls job 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.979
 sewing work it was a lot more 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.360
 much more suitable what was needed 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:02.339
 that I prove to my grandfather that I 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.960
 could do it and that was nice 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:07.680
 so what am I trying to do 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:11.400
 to have this mix of materials that 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.229
 makes me love at the same time remember yes the 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.159
 side my grandmother you will complete very 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:20.100
 suave the seam I have the beauty and the 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.960
 beauty of clothes completed and then the 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.740
 strength of the material behind I believe 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.740
 it's a little bit 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.859
 in hoeing is a notion of skin of 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.060
 second skin so here is even if the 

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:45.719
 poland and metal 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.479
 I found that the term worked 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:51.500
 well so that I have appropriated this 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.500
 metal cladding term 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.400
 I do not know if it's mysterious already 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.840
 the fact of being able to realize such 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.220
 object maybe that these mysterious in 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.220
 Self-technical way 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:23.040
 that consists of married a form whose 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.629
 I superimpose sheets of metal that 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.540
 I push back on each other 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:30.180
 then these cavities are who 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.730
 are filled by the by the metal in 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.079
 sheet and then to be very thought 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.299
 very finely to give you a lot 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:38.850
 a lot of softness to the finish 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.660
 is the interest of the cladding also it is not 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.030
 is working on leaves 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.950
 extremely fine that allows me 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.299
 precisely to marry very 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.299
 very round random 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.550
 m 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.050
 there is also the matter you need the touch 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.420
 and we do not touch any more materials 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.160
 touch more people and that for me I 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.680
 think it's been a long time 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.830
 frustrated and I believe that I touch the 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.709
 matter there because and this is the multitude 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.870
 of action that I exert on the noble of 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.910
 beginning to the end 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.130
 116 constantly play almost I caress him 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.390
 so not at the beginning it's very very 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.120
 aggressive until it becomes 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.250
 really had a caress going on somewhere 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.270
 very very very very thing here and there 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.270
 this is the culmination 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.530
 so why the furniture do you 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.910
 make material associations that 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.700
 have nothing to do together 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:08.090
 the softness of a leather dome with the 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:11.090
 kitan metal coldness that I'm going 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:14.090
 try to warm up by embedding a 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.730
 hot woods that's what's interesting 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.900
 it's not just the metal material 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.540
 for methane 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.270
 it's not that it's true that this 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:26.350
 technique suits me perfectly but 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:29.630
 without the combination of other materials 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.100
 I would have a hard time designing a piece of furniture 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.170
 I really like what he 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.910
 does it matter is yes they emanate 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:39.340
 especially a kind of poetry 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.340
 it's mostly that's the main thing 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.590
 it must still be able and evolve 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.030
 in time be the memory of a time 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.290
 who passes the memory of a generation 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.290
 spent in a year 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:11.150
 oxidation we will continue to work 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.830
 time will have made his case the 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.780
 piece and that's precisely who is 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.180
 interesting and that brings us back to saying 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:21.100
 that we will find an extra soul to 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.100
 houma bhl the mobbing life 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:28.339
 must move either a or the charge 

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:28.339
 of moods that's the main thing 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.280
