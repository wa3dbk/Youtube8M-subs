but a bonito South fish and tuna and I
had<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:57.989> go<00:00:58.140> earlier<00:00:58.469> on<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:58.949> guess<00:00:59.579> the

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
had a go earlier on it and I guess the

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.220 
had a go earlier on it and I guess the
thing<00:00:59.910> is<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.149> they're<00:01:00.329> they're<00:01:00.899> ultra

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
thing is it they're they're ultra

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.720 
thing is it they're they're ultra
realistic<00:01:01.440> when<00:01:01.859> you're<00:01:01.980> fighting<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.370> tuner

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
realistic when you're fighting a tuner

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.189 
realistic when you're fighting a tuner
you<00:01:02.760> can<00:01:03.000> actually<00:01:03.120> feel<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.510> headshakes<00:01:04.049> of

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
you can actually feel the headshakes of

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.899 
you can actually feel the headshakes of
the<00:01:04.260> tuna<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.920> runs<00:01:05.220> are<00:01:05.430> really<00:01:05.610> strong

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
the tuna and the runs are really strong

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.630 
the tuna and the runs are really strong

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
it's really realistic so the machines

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.260 
it's really realistic so the machines
are<00:01:10.890> programmed<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.580> can<00:01:11.700> output<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.150> any

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
are programmed you can output it to any

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.630

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.050 
yeah so you just let it out there you
can<00:02:34.710> program<00:02:35.070> this<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.400> be<00:02:35.490> different<00:02:35.820> lengths

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
can program this to be different lengths

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.430 
can program this to be different lengths
depend<00:02:36.330> on<00:02:36.390> how<00:02:36.540> long<00:02:36.600> you<00:02:36.930> want<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.170> fight

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
line or stick up and as soon as we get

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.910 
line or stick up and as soon as we get
to<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.090> 20<00:02:42.300> meters<00:02:42.660> it<00:02:43.200> kicks<00:02:43.440> in<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.680> Mario

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
programmed individually so it's not just

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.490 
programmed individually so it's not just
a<00:03:20.400> generic<00:03:20.670> kick<00:03:21.180> ya<00:03:21.510> see<00:03:21.900> on<00:03:21.989> the<00:03:22.050> screen<00:03:22.320> that

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
a generic kick ya see on the screen that

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.500 
a generic kick ya see on the screen that
is<00:03:22.650> sitting<00:03:22.860> there<00:03:23.160> and<00:03:23.430> just<00:03:24.000> do<00:03:24.120> it<00:03:24.150> slight

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
is sitting there and just do it slight

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:25.910 
is sitting there and just do it slight
movements<00:03:24.989> not<00:03:25.080> pushing<00:03:25.410> against<00:03:25.620> anything

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
movements not pushing against anything

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.290 
movements not pushing against anything
so<00:03:26.070> if<00:03:26.130> I<00:03:26.220> actually<00:03:26.400> try<00:03:26.700> to<00:03:26.730> hold<00:03:26.970> him<00:03:27.060> up<00:03:27.209> a

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
so if I actually try to hold him up a

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.650 
so if I actually try to hold him up a
bit

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
bit

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.630 
bit
I<00:03:27.690> can<00:03:28.290> I<00:03:28.470> can<00:03:28.680> actually<00:03:28.800> make<00:03:29.100> him<00:03:29.250> angry<00:03:29.610> and

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
I can I can actually make him angry and

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.340 
I can I can actually make him angry and
he'll<00:03:29.970> go<00:03:30.150> for<00:03:30.330> a<00:03:30.390> run<00:03:30.540> to<00:03:30.780> try<00:03:30.900> to<00:03:31.020> swim<00:03:31.230> away

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
he'll go for a run to try to swim away

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.340 
he'll go for a run to try to swim away
see<00:03:32.209> just<00:03:33.209> like<00:03:33.330> that<00:03:33.390> so<00:03:33.810> it's<00:03:33.989> really

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
see just like that so it's really

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.050 
see just like that so it's really
realistic<00:03:34.620> so<00:03:35.040> if<00:03:35.220> you<00:03:35.310> put<00:03:35.459> too<00:03:35.580> much<00:03:35.610> food<00:03:35.880> on

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
realistic so if you put too much food on

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.949 
realistic so if you put too much food on
them<00:03:36.890> also<00:03:38.239> simulators<00:03:39.239> and<00:03:39.450> fighting<00:03:39.780> so<00:03:39.900> if

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
them also simulators and fighting so if

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.600 
them also simulators and fighting so if
I<00:03:40.080> hold<00:03:40.380> that<00:03:40.470> too<00:03:40.739> much<00:03:40.920> and<00:03:41.160> try<00:03:41.310> a<00:03:41.340> straight

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
I hold that too much and try a straight

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.640 
I hold that too much and try a straight
ticket<00:03:41.790> or<00:03:42.120> too<00:03:42.750> hard<00:03:42.959> or<00:03:43.080> if<00:03:43.200> I<00:03:43.260> had<00:03:43.380> a<00:03:43.410> to

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
ticket or too hard or if I had a to

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:44.990 
ticket or too hard or if I had a to
bigger<00:03:43.860> outfit<00:03:44.190> like<00:03:44.310> that<00:03:44.459> outfit<00:03:44.760> on<00:03:44.820> this

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
bigger outfit like that outfit on this

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.640 
bigger outfit like that outfit on this
size<00:03:45.209> Jenna<00:03:45.480> yeah<00:03:45.780> you<00:03:46.050> can<00:03:46.200> actually<00:03:46.470> pull

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
size Jenna yeah you can actually pull

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.979 
size Jenna yeah you can actually pull
porks<00:03:47.010> really<00:03:47.610> so<00:03:47.880> it's<00:03:48.239> that<00:03:48.450> realistic<00:03:48.900> that

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
porks really so it's that realistic that

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.540 
porks really so it's that realistic that
it<00:03:49.110> knows<00:03:49.290> when<00:03:49.530> you've<00:03:49.680> gone<00:03:49.860> too<00:03:50.100> hard<00:03:50.370> on

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
fish too soft on fish look if I just let

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.320

this<00:03:52.890> bail<00:03:53.130> arm<00:03:53.340> open<00:03:53.640> let<00:03:53.760> him<00:03:53.880> go<00:03:54.030> you'll

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
this bail arm open let him go you'll

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.610 
this bail arm open let him go you'll
lose<00:03:54.510> it<00:03:54.690> because<00:03:54.780> you<00:03:55.110> haven't<00:03:55.350> held<00:03:55.500> the

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
lose it because you haven't held the

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:56.690 
lose it because you haven't held the
hooks<00:03:55.769> in<00:03:55.890> the<00:03:55.980> fish<00:03:56.130> and<00:03:56.220> they<00:03:56.310> can<00:03:56.459> spit<00:03:56.670> the

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
hooks in the fish and they can spit the

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.420 
hooks in the fish and they can spit the
hooks<00:03:56.970> so<00:03:57.840> they<00:03:58.080> do<00:03:58.140> everything<00:03:58.500> like<00:03:58.680> I<00:03:59.100> can't
