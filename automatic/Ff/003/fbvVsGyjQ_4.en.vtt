00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
but then I noticed the the second week

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.850 
but then I noticed the the second week
it<00:00:45.219> was<00:00:45.340> thought<00:00:45.579> earlier<00:00:46.239> in<00:00:46.390> earlier<00:00:46.930> and<00:00:47.559> on

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
it was thought earlier in earlier and on

it was thought earlier in earlier and on
that<00:00:48.070> Wednesday<00:00:48.309> it<00:00:48.760> was<00:00:48.940> like<00:00:49.180> a<00:00:49.210> ten<00:00:49.809> o'clock

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
10:30 in the morning and against where I

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.549 
10:30 in the morning and against where I
couldn't<00:00:53.260> even<00:00:53.530> breathe<00:00:53.800> so<00:00:54.789> I<00:00:54.820> went<00:00:55.180> and<00:00:55.809> I

couldn't even breathe so I went and I

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:58.860 
couldn't even breathe so I went and I

that<00:01:16.929> I<00:01:17.170> had<00:01:17.409> the<00:01:17.560> hole<00:01:17.770> in<00:01:17.979> my<00:01:18.009> heart<00:01:18.310> and<00:01:18.749> that

00:01:19.739 --> 00:01:19.749 
that I had the hole in my heart and that

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:22.289 
that I had the hole in my heart and that
was<00:01:20.170> making<00:01:20.380> the<00:01:20.529> heart<00:01:20.709> work<00:01:20.979> I<00:01:21.310> guess<00:01:21.759> harder

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
was making the heart work I guess harder

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:25.260 
was making the heart work I guess harder
and<00:01:22.659> giving<00:01:23.109> me<00:01:23.200> the<00:01:23.529> heaviness<00:01:24.149> when<00:01:25.149> the

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
and giving me the heaviness when the

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.539 
and giving me the heaviness when the
patient<00:01:25.719> presented<00:01:25.899> to<00:01:26.289> the<00:01:26.380> emergency<00:01:26.889> room

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
patient presented to the emergency room

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:29.609 
patient presented to the emergency room
she<00:01:28.060> had<00:01:28.299> shortness<00:01:28.959> of<00:01:29.109> breath<00:01:29.319> and<00:01:29.560> chest

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
she had shortness of breath and chest

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.730 
she had shortness of breath and chest
pain<00:01:30.099> and<00:01:30.549> at<00:01:30.999> Holy<00:01:31.179> Cross<00:01:31.450> we<00:01:32.020> routinely<00:01:32.349> do

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
pain and at Holy Cross we routinely do

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.489 
pain and at Holy Cross we routinely do
cardiac<00:01:33.219> CT<00:01:33.399> to<00:01:33.969> determine<00:01:34.509> if<00:01:34.840> the<00:01:35.319> patient

00:01:35.489 --> 00:01:35.499 
cardiac CT to determine if the patient

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:37.609 
cardiac CT to determine if the patient
needs<00:01:35.919> to<00:01:36.009> be<00:01:36.189> admitted<00:01:36.549> to<00:01:36.729> the<00:01:36.819> hospital<00:01:36.939> for

needs to be admitted to the hospital for
further<00:01:38.619> invasive<00:01:39.369> testing<00:01:39.880> and<00:01:40.209> the<00:01:41.079> cardiac

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:41.469 
further invasive testing and the cardiac

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:43.429 
further invasive testing and the cardiac
computer<00:01:42.279> tomorrow<00:01:42.639> for<00:01:42.849> cardiac<00:01:43.239> CT

computer tomorrow for cardiac CT

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.229 
computer tomorrow for cardiac CT
demonstrated<00:01:44.439> the<00:01:44.529> following<00:01:45.039> so<00:01:45.819> we<00:01:46.060> are

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:46.239 
demonstrated the following so we are

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:48.239 
demonstrated the following so we are
looking<00:01:46.450> three<00:01:47.079> dimensionally<00:01:47.649> inside<00:01:48.069> the

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:48.249 
looking three dimensionally inside the

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:53.099 
looking three dimensionally inside the
heart<00:01:48.520> and<00:01:49.200> as<00:01:50.200> we<00:01:50.469> pan<00:01:51.009> and<00:01:51.340> through<00:01:52.109> through

00:01:53.099 --> 00:01:53.109 
heart and as we pan and through through

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:57.449 
heart and as we pan and through through
the<00:01:53.529> atrial<00:01:54.399> chambers<00:01:55.709> we<00:01:56.709> can<00:01:56.889> see<00:01:57.189> that

00:01:57.449 --> 00:01:57.459 
the atrial chambers we can see that

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:59.580 
the atrial chambers we can see that
there<00:01:57.700> is<00:01:57.729> clearly<00:01:58.270> a<00:01:58.389> hole<00:01:58.749> in<00:01:58.959> the<00:01:59.079> heart<00:01:59.349> and

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
there is clearly a hole in the heart and

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.069 
there is clearly a hole in the heart and
we're<00:02:00.189> looking<00:02:00.609> directly<00:02:00.939> from<00:02:01.569> one<00:02:01.779> chamber

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:02.079 
we're looking directly from one chamber

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:04.589 
we're looking directly from one chamber
to<00:02:02.349> the<00:02:02.649> other<00:02:02.950> when<00:02:03.729> there<00:02:03.880> should<00:02:04.119> be<00:02:04.329> a

00:02:04.589 --> 00:02:04.599 
to the other when there should be a

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:07.409 
to the other when there should be a
frank<00:02:05.049> separation<00:02:05.979> so<00:02:06.579> this<00:02:06.729> patient<00:02:06.969> has<00:02:07.389> a

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:07.419 
frank separation so this patient has a

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:10.020 
frank separation so this patient has a
communication<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:09.369> what's<00:02:09.579> called<00:02:09.849> the

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
communication and what's called the

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.869 
communication and what's called the
atrial<00:02:10.599> septum<00:02:11.280> essentially<00:02:12.280> a<00:02:12.310> hole<00:02:12.579> in<00:02:12.760> her

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:12.879 
atrial septum essentially a hole in her

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:13.390 
atrial septum essentially a hole in her
heart

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
heart

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.520

so this is a picture an echo picture of
the<00:04:29.629> device<00:04:29.930> after<00:04:30.229> it's<00:04:30.469> been<00:04:30.620> deployed

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
the device after it's been deployed

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.499 
the device after it's been deployed
where<00:04:32.150> the<00:04:32.330> hole<00:04:32.509> used<00:04:33.020> to<00:04:33.169> be<00:04:33.319> here<00:04:34.180> in<00:04:35.180> this

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:35.509 
where the hole used to be here in this

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:38.260 
where the hole used to be here in this
piece<00:04:36.439> of<00:04:36.469> tissue<00:04:36.770> in<00:04:37.009> between<00:04:37.340> the<00:04:37.849> two<00:04:38.029> atria

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
piece of tissue in between the two atria

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.429 
piece of tissue in between the two atria
but<00:04:39.169> now<00:04:39.349> that<00:04:39.710> hole<00:04:40.610> is<00:04:40.969> sealed<00:04:41.330> with<00:04:42.229> this

00:04:42.429 --> 00:04:42.439 
but now that hole is sealed with this

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:45.700 
but now that hole is sealed with this
device<00:04:43.569> that<00:04:44.569> stays<00:04:44.810> in<00:04:44.840> place<00:04:45.199> and<00:04:45.229> becomes

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
device that stays in place and becomes

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:47.439 
device that stays in place and becomes
part<00:04:45.979> of<00:04:46.069> her<00:04:46.159> heart<00:04:46.370> over<00:04:46.699> the<00:04:46.939> next<00:04:47.210> couple

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:47.449 
part of her heart over the next couple

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:50.019 
part of her heart over the next couple
of<00:04:47.629> months<00:04:47.810> so<00:04:48.349> this<00:04:48.620> is<00:04:48.770> another<00:04:49.069> way<00:04:49.310> to<00:04:49.340> look

00:04:50.019 --> 00:04:50.029 
of months so this is another way to look

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:53.519 
of months so this is another way to look
at<00:04:50.599> the<00:04:51.349> device<00:04:51.650> and<00:04:52.099> its<00:04:52.639> effectiveness

00:04:53.519 --> 00:04:53.529 
at the device and its effectiveness

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:56.489 
at the device and its effectiveness
initially<00:04:54.529> because<00:04:54.860> the<00:04:55.039> device<00:04:55.310> is<00:04:55.520> porous

00:04:56.489 --> 00:04:56.499 
initially because the device is porous

00:04:56.499 --> 00:05:00.339 
initially because the device is porous
there<00:04:57.499> is<00:04:57.710> some<00:04:58.400> communication<00:04:59.330> between<00:05:00.020> the

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:00.349 
there is some communication between the

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:02.290 
there is some communication between the
two<00:05:00.500> heart<00:05:00.710> chambers<00:05:01.159> but<00:05:01.879> as<00:05:02.029> time

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
two heart chambers but as time

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.420 
two heart chambers but as time
progresses<00:05:02.750> and<00:05:02.930> a<00:05:03.199> small<00:05:03.650> layer<00:05:03.919> of<00:05:03.949> skin

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
progresses and a small layer of skin

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.269 
progresses and a small layer of skin
grows<00:05:04.879> over<00:05:05.719> the<00:05:05.840> device<00:05:06.139> it<00:05:06.469> will<00:05:06.800> completely

00:05:07.269 --> 00:05:07.279 
grows over the device it will completely

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:09.040 
grows over the device it will completely
seal<00:05:07.610> off<00:05:07.819> the<00:05:07.969> communication<00:05:08.629> between<00:05:08.779> the

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
seal off the communication between the

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.830 
seal off the communication between the
two<00:05:09.080> heart<00:05:09.379> chambers<00:05:10.210> so<00:05:11.210> they<00:05:11.360> went<00:05:11.599> and<00:05:11.779> they

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
two heart chambers so they went and they

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.519 
two heart chambers so they went and they
put<00:05:12.139> this<00:05:12.229> device<00:05:12.500> and<00:05:13.069> and<00:05:14.139> last<00:05:15.139> night<00:05:15.379> was

00:05:15.519 --> 00:05:15.529 
put this device and and last night was

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:18.279 
put this device and and last night was
my<00:05:15.590> first<00:05:15.770> night<00:05:16.460> since<00:05:16.699> it<00:05:17.060> I<00:05:17.330> had<00:05:17.810> absolutely

my first night since it I had absolutely

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:20.800 
my first night since it I had absolutely
no<00:05:18.349> heaviness<00:05:18.830> I<00:05:19.310> really<00:05:20.270> did<00:05:20.449> I<00:05:20.539> couldn't
