oh wow um you guys get the idea it's
really<00:04:20.030> simple<00:04:20.239> to<00:04:20.480> do<00:04:20.660> scale<00:04:21.260> of<00:04:21.410> 1<00:04:21.560> to<00:04:21.590> 10<00:04:21.709> I

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
really simple to do scale of 1 to 10 I

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:26.110 
really simple to do scale of 1 to 10 I
rate<00:04:22.190> this<00:04:22.310> to<00:04:22.460> 6<00:04:22.930> so<00:04:23.930> yeah
