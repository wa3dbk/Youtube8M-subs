00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.120

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.110
 these points are what is going to 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.119
 opportunity for us to try to 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.100
 less fight for the title since it does not have 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.570
 a strong team in 2010 achieves a lot 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.110

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.920
 half volley and kicked in the middle of the goal 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.200
 Felipe made it easy 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.310
 and look at this move from the south rs the show will have 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.039

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.659
 Paulista is on the net plus one 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.390
 Wellington Paulista who has done 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.700
 very well in these championships have marked 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.730

 It ends very well, it 's a big deal. 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.330
 player wellington paulista 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.730
 He had to be our left wing, right? 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.250
 and there are no rushing posts in the area. 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.260
 have the chance and felipe let it out 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.670
 finished the first time of play to 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.730
 people have been starting the second 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.739
 time with Marcel there and in that 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.140
 Flemish came with shawl and book sweaters 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:43.019
 2 shot from the back and hit the 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.299
 Easy match taiyou the galatto you 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.500
 defense ' and then followed firmly beautiful 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.750
 galatto defense 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.610
 ours could leave and end up leaving 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.739
 playing the wrong game and the Flemish had another 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.170
 chance in court the other triple 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.510
 Portuguese athlete we all asked to 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.350

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.630

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:06.350
 the Flemish again he marcelo moreno in 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:08.480
 face of the goal lost and now prepare 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.560
 to bid one more book of history 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.920
 of football 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:16.490
 see only Amaral hit that Marcelo Amorim 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.110
 not marcelo this is not how you play it 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:22.220
 This is Marcelo Moreno 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:24.500
 see only his chip chip was not the 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.890
 day of the marcelo moreno voted acate fugue 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.720
 They sent him to love in the curve. 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.500
 it was not possible for him not to score and the 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.050
 training game 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.360
 joão vitor in the steady beat and made this 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.190
 defense without the Flemish in London lost 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.950
 another chance with elias headed 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.290
 galatto made this defense there but only 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.940
 if you can speak and is on the corner 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.160
 Mateus Ferraz very end and have a chance 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.900

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.270
 police area and tried to letter luiz 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.280
 Sergio was very careful and gave a made a 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.690
 goal and one of the houses and electronic but 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.610
 it was nothing serious 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.170
 We will be able to count on a house 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.730
 for the next matches 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.370
 he is a great defender there is always 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.620
 faults of our team is not really 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.840
 2 to 0 while the Flemish has also 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.760
 adding three more points in total nine 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.210
 political and then the game is Portuguese 1 113 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.340
 baby I already have not even the 27 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.170
 min of game ball in the area fábia ferreira 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.870
 head put us in front 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:20.810
 advantage with this head goal 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.360
 a goal and well finished the head of 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.950
 all right in the drawer also had chances 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.590
 defense that reaches the goalkeeper of the 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.270
 but it was an atypical game not 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.940
 legal and faceless 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:35.360
 far beyond john the cheater came time to get 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.670
 which alone gave in and then has 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.350
 who fight for this judgment boy heragy 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:42.560
 you were a warrior Joao vitor not 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:45.170
 so game and if there is an uproar and there 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.220
 the launch there in the last 90 game the 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.200
 game bid 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.630
 civilian handball was quick because 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:53.390
 really did not have an attack had nothing 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.850
 nothing in the engine was too truncated but 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:58.490
 still hot get out with more 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.560
 three points added in the table and this is 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.780
 very important we added out 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.480
 whether with actions results up to the number 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.350
 January and got the sum of 6 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.630
 his brother 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.970
 and then the game was good with another step there 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.130
 on the 1st day in the Basque I have been in a 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.530
 kick at home with joão vitor coming soon 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.600
 major attacks money communism 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.460
 and it was easy for alessandro 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.920
 and there is cracked our waters what he did and 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.890
 Fábio Ferreira make a mistake Edmilson 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:27.440
 prison and another of my dejected 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:29.990
 Basque than the fabled Ferreira did in 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:33.260
 that made the Basque made a beautiful 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:36.140
 triangulation there and edmilson the kick 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.580
 left without a chance and then the 

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.260
 33 minutes into the game 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:43.550
 swayed but only dominated in the chest turned 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:46.010
 kicking and marcel's cracker 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:48.830
 our team and the top scorer killer 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:50.090
 fuck our team marcel is the guy 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:53.450
 really from criciúma 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:55.370
 see only the boy's boy and the turn 

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:57.470
 scoring a goal 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.630
 for us and this is very good on a 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:02.840
 crossing the area marcel tried to harvest 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:05.570
 1 alessandro made this end new defense 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:08.060
 laser alessandro de novo it great 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:10.430
 Santo André College and Rolling Ball in the 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.570
 second time and then it would take people 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.650
 Let's see how it goes. 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.770
 to happen 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:17.120
 marcel came with the ball and at 74 he ran 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.830
 marcel top luís 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:24.280
 the police arrived dribbled the defender 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:27.229
 the kick of the criciúma 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:29.300
 lines that strike with the crisis once 

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:31.280
 that took with the chest of the defender and 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:34.699
 kicked in the corner of the goalkeeper 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:38.330
 great goal from Criciuma and then SIPRI Vasco 

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:41.120
 hit rebate reginaldo goal of the Basque 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:44.120
 range the Basque has reached the tie at 79 

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.919
 see only the kick to the goal but Mateus 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:50.660
 then came back and generally only made one 

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:53.780
 goal and then the game ends and players hit or 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.910
 of the nine points played 7 that did not 

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.800
 is a bad average is an average quite the 

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:59.900
 contrary is soon open goal is not 1 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.150
 about the low-pressure team such as the 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:03.979
 close to the users of the 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:06.169
 opponents in this good that we got 

00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:08.870
 even the Portuguese is a more average team 

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:10.910
 how is it more of a kind we got 

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:12.289
 got the win the flamengo tied 

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:14.900
 with Basque who are two big teams 

00:07:12.289 --> 00:07:16.190
 So it was a good one there, what's going on? 

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:18.229
 happening on the next day 20 has a game 

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:19.880
 against the nautical versus black bridge and 

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:21.110
 then start downloading galley 

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.150
 I 'll let you know 

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:24.289
 We do not have the money to 

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:27.050
 transfers 

00:07:24.289 --> 00:07:30.620
 I already looked there we do not have any 

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:32.419
 financial condition of trying to 

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:33.440
 hire good players and we are 

00:07:32.419 --> 00:07:35.240
 first tied with the 

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.740
 with 13 points then coming back 

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:40.370
 here we have no financial condition 

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:43.190
 I really wanted to make a 

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:46.880
 legal transfer that was good but 

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:48.949
 It will not work because it really does not 

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:50.449
 condition does not have enough money to 

00:07:48.949 --> 00:07:52.460
 criciúma team that finishes 

00:07:50.449 --> 00:07:54.260
 making it rather difficult to leave 

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:56.539
 that when you have finished and 

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.500
 championship in the end for sure people 

00:07:56.539 --> 00:07:59.479
 will have money to hire 

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:02.210
 good players, it's not going to be for now 

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:04.580

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:06.440
 transfer and then you also the 

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:08.330
 top scorer and 11 assists 

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:10.639

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:15.370

00:08:10.639 --> 00:08:15.370
