students need the most help if you give

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.600 
students need the most help if you give
an<00:03:23.080> assessment<00:03:23.620> and<00:03:23.709> that's<00:03:24.040> just<00:03:24.250> the<00:03:24.370> end<00:03:24.489> of

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
an assessment and that's just the end of

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.690 
an assessment and that's just the end of
it<00:03:24.760> then<00:03:25.150> it's<00:03:26.050> basically<00:03:26.230> a<00:03:26.500> waste<00:03:26.709> of<00:03:26.980> time

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
it then it's basically a waste of time

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.460 
it then it's basically a waste of time
you<00:03:27.910> want<00:03:28.090> to<00:03:28.150> use<00:03:28.300> that<00:03:28.630> data<00:03:28.810> to<00:03:28.930> see<00:03:29.230> how<00:03:29.260> to

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
you want to use that data to see how to

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.660 
you want to use that data to see how to
move<00:03:29.709> students<00:03:30.040> even<00:03:30.280> further

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670

consistently they picked the wrong

consistently they picked the wrong
answer<00:03:32.440> so<00:03:32.950> I<00:03:32.980> wanted<00:03:33.190> to<00:03:33.310> look<00:03:33.430> at<00:03:33.580> those

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
answer so I wanted to look at those
