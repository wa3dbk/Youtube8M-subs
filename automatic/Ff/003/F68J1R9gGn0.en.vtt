00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.240
 Speak there personal video beauty new in 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.490
 area and good who accompanies the channel there is 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.099
 some time already knows that sometimes I bring 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.830
 here another video of 10 km sometimes of 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.389
 some beach that the game then has to me 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.520
 I would also like to make it very clear that 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.590
 the following was not what I discovered was a 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.439
 friend quoted what showed a video of a 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.779
 Gringo for me is an American guy made and 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.000
 published and has a lot of Brazilian 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.000
 have access to these videos ok then 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.590
 I decided to record there for power is these 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.890
 people who do not have access to these 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.840
 videos there to learn and use and 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.010
 can also ease there a little 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.320
 life at the time of play 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.079
 Beauty is good, you saw there I was 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.260
 showing a rocket launcher and and a snip 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.960
 okay I recommend you to snip and 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.789
 with rocket launcher and preference and a 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.649
 rocket launcher that is guided to the 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.620
 to make it even easier to 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.500
 your life but it is not mandatory to be 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.859
 guided beauty is good you have two options 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.239
 to use this glitch 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:06.360
 just the first one that I'm going to 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.400
 do is reduce my weight darkness 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.170
 on top of the crystal 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.090
 and when the stadium is close to 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.090
 blast I'm going towards the second 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.790
 Crystal as well and this crystal 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.250
 I'm on top gonna blow the enemies 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.630
 who will be around will die and will 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.939
 give me a little more advantage on the hour 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.140
 to run because I'm going to be underweight 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.820
 of darkness, or you can 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.040
 ignore this first crystal only 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.799
 diminishes its weight of darkness and 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.290
 towards the second crystal and then 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.540
 climb right here on this rock where 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.530
 I'm showing you guys and staying more 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.560
 or less there 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.799
 in this position with this vision what will 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.079
 happen is crystal're going to explode and 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.299
 momentum is the impact of the 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:55.979
 Crystal exploding in he's going to play us 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:58.320
 Up is the area there in the columns ok 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.570
 arriving up here you go in 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.579
 direction to the light is 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.369
 Notice that there are those lights there or in the 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:08.160
 left corner that the lights at the beginning of the 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.979
 The game falls down there when it enters the 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.920
 Ok network is another thing I recommend 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.620
 It's for you when the glass 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.580
 explode your left and right directional 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.260
 right 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:24.120
 you position it on the left side ok 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.300
 thus making the doll turn in the 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.330
 time of the explosion and fall to the top 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.340
 beauty is another tip as well that you already 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.010
 must have noticed that the place is very dark 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.560
 you simply increase the brightness of the 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.110
 your game or simply increase then the 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.200
 brightness of your television so you go 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.150
 to see the environment better and not 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.430
 You can lose yourself, you're dying. 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.190
 time this here you can be done with 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.500
 six people is more on the case or five 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.580
 people will die and only one person 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.590
 will do this 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.440
 preferably by checking that you can return 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.810
 life case of shit so I hope 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.530
 this video that helps a lot of people and was the 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.569
 that I told 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.860
 Congratulations to the person who discovered it was not the 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.470
 who discovered they are just reviewing 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.330
 for those who do not have access to these videos 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.489
 Americans then ok 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.950
 and if you are that kind of person who 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.680
 complain too much there that the tart the 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.150
 milk used the pilot Paul in your body 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.519
 I'm kind of fucking there for your 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.680
 opinion can instigate comments 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.660
 because they already ruined the game when 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.760
 sell the game in half then if I 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.530
 There we are going to use that 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.850
 son of a bitch get fired and learn to 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.579
 work right 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.320
 Good pass there, the crystal is fixing. 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:37.079
 that I got dark as well 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:40.019
 quietly passed by the rider of there 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:42.390
 good and stress free without giving a 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.130
 shot and very careful not to okay 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.019
 happen that happened to me this 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.329
 time I was recording I was 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.070
 somewhat lost by the fact that the 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:52.200
 television is a little too much 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.019
 're lower dark you follow 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.359
 normal path does not pass through any 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:00.090
 will go through just applying the 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:02.970
 status of that keitÃ¡ that crystal 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.220
 who then exploded the crystal 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.620
 next to this yoki gentleman is very 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:12.209
 blind man did not see me either because of the 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:16.440
 darkness and moving towards the middle 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:19.859
 the circle where you can open it is 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.930
 the event is where you will release the bridge but 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.940
 getting there you will not be in the middle 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.490
 You will not be in the middle will not 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.120
 exchange a shot with anyone but the 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.880
 gold 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.050
 here will want to kill it will want is and 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.360
 next to you 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.130
 so that's why I recommended it there is 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.410
 one launches rockets guided to power 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.750
 kill the gold and also one and sinai because 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.850
 how far it will be from you take and 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.580
 will be able to get him to defeat the enemy 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.919
 It's okay, it 's relative there in front of that. 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.830
 green spot right that location it is already 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:52.020
 bridge and remember not to go through 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.389
 no crystal except the last 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.180
 crystal there what is the most 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:59.250
 and the circle where you want to activate the 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.880
 bridge event coming here 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:05.250
 you will simply do the following 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:08.910
 activated crystal forgiveness activated bridge 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:11.430
 comes close to the crystal and then my friend just 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:14.160
 cease to wait for the weight of darkness there 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.419
 stay here over the stone you noticed 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.400
 That I jumped right there. 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:19.740
 but I thought at the time of the recording said 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.410
 I will not go down to show that the singer has 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.990
 this stone here is not this big stone 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:26.639
 're going to see a lot of enemy then I 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.500
 I have a hole so be careful to 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:31.410
 not die in the end because it is frustrating 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:34.470
 Fuck you and just get this stone back. 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.750
 smaller here next to the crystal arrived 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.000
 here my enemy friends and mark knock 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.880
 in you if you want in the middle you have 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.940
 that being in the middle in the center just came out 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:47.310
 dancing listening to the sound and waiting for the 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.770
 groove when the group is my face 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:53.190
 partner is simply the rocket in the 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:56.520
 enemy and snip in the damn my partner 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:58.590
 Now enjoy the sound that the glitch is 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.960
 I hope it helps a lot of people if not
