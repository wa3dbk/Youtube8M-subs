00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.890 

there's<00:04:37.700> a<00:04:37.790> little<00:04:38.000> pause<00:04:38.210> the<00:04:38.480> first<00:04:38.630> time

there's a little pause the first time

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.420 
there's a little pause the first time
the<00:04:39.140> first<00:04:39.320> couple<00:04:39.740> of<00:04:39.830> times<00:04:39.890> they<00:04:40.190> do<00:04:40.250> the

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
the first couple of times they do the

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.810 
the first couple of times they do the
intro<00:04:40.820> but<00:04:41.330> there's<00:04:41.510> no<00:04:41.690> anyhow<00:04:42.380> he<00:04:42.950> just<00:04:43.670> have

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
intro but there's no anyhow he just have

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.940 
intro but there's no anyhow he just have
to<00:04:43.940> listen<00:04:44.090> to<00:04:44.360> it<00:04:44.480> but<00:04:44.600> anyhow<00:04:45.530> I<00:04:45.560> hope<00:04:45.770> that

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
to listen to it but anyhow I hope that

to listen to it but anyhow I hope that
was<00:04:46.070> helpful
