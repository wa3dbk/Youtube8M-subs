 It's called PD by law and jealousy is 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.810

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.519
 chess who was using a lot in the 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.289
 last winter and I believe that 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.140

 made the line tutorials decorated too 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.870
 but I did it in pictures and when I did 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.360
 these nails many girls sent me and 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.700
 mail messages asking you to record on

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.800
 I decided to produce it for you, it's just 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.449
 using black and white enamel enamel 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.140
 of your preference but the black and white 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.270
 is the traditional color of the print is I used it 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.649
 also very finely personal that you 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.930
 found in cosmetic stores in 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:06.659
 pharmacies or in bad theories and also the 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.880
 so it's google 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.580
 check out sony's step by step 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.010
 I used these two enamels of 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.650
 preparation you will need a 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.930
 a fine brush is a good actor 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.780
 so I passed the black enamel on all 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.490
 the nails and the white on the ring finger with 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.909
 black enamel I 'll start doing 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.000
 ball first step 3 in the middle and three 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.850
 on the sides always taking care of a 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.070
 stay well on the other side 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.009
 with a thin brush we'll go 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.369
 to draw a little ball 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:44.790
 is this your wish if the nail detail 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:48.030
 you do - with the whites and disappear for 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.970
 the bigger you make the more squares you can go 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.030
 adapting is according to the size of the 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.909
 your fingernail is okay and take care to always do 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.719
 so a little square on the other side of 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.719
 regular size 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:07.250
 with the same brush you will make a 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.130
 picnic on top of a little square and 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.900
 then connect the other end of the 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.390
 top square 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.030
 first a little bikini after 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.640
 connect the tip of the other top square 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.970
 and repeats this in all 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.820
