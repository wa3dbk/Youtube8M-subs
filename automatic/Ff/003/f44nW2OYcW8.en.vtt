come<00:01:36.390> back<00:01:36.570> in<00:01:36.720> this<00:01:36.840> game<00:01:37.049> but<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:38.189> doesn't

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
come back in this game but that doesn't

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.039

deal<00:01:38.579> with<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.820> demon<00:01:39.150> so<00:01:39.329> alongside<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.810> he

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
deal with the demon so alongside that he

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.450 
deal with the demon so alongside that he
does<00:01:40.229> need<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.439> heart<00:01:40.680> removal<00:01:41.040> spell<00:01:41.250> and

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
basically like the order he draws them

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.120 
basically like the order he draws them
in<00:01:42.720> doesn't<00:01:42.960> really<00:01:42.990> matter<00:01:43.259> but<00:01:43.770> it's<00:01:44.009> like

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
in doesn't really matter but it's like

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.289 
in doesn't really matter but it's like
this<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.399> where's<00:01:44.520> has<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.790> be<00:01:44.880> next<00:01:45.060> turn

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
this and where's has to be next turn

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:51.960

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
Phineas not shuffled as document so this

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.730 
Phineas not shuffled as document so this
is<00:04:22.930> a<00:04:23.080> common<00:04:23.590> way<00:04:23.710> to<00:04:23.740> correct<00:04:24.190> this<00:04:25.740> yeah

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
is a common way to correct this yeah

is a common way to correct this yeah
it's<00:04:26.889> kind<00:04:27.040> of<00:04:27.070> weird<00:04:27.310> when<00:04:27.610> when<00:04:28.150> something

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419

like<00:04:37.660> I<00:04:38.110> don't<00:04:38.950> know<00:04:39.010> if<00:04:39.100> I<00:04:39.130> put<00:04:39.280> them<00:04:39.400> all<00:04:39.460> in

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
like I don't know if I put them all in

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.170 
like I don't know if I put them all in
the<00:04:39.610> bottom<00:04:39.820> or<00:04:39.880> not<00:04:40.000> yeah<00:04:41.820> looks<00:04:42.820> like<00:04:42.970> we<00:04:43.090> are

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
the bottom or not yeah looks like we are

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.260 
the bottom or not yeah looks like we are
fixed<00:04:43.660> this<00:04:44.289> is<00:04:44.470> the<00:04:44.590> draw<00:04:45.389> it's<00:04:46.389> a<00:04:46.539> shred<00:04:46.930> for

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
fixed this is the draw it's a shred for

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.990 
fixed this is the draw it's a shred for
so<00:04:49.270> certainly<00:04:49.690> not<00:04:49.840> the<00:04:49.960> worst<00:04:50.110> draw<00:04:50.440> but<00:04:51.000> not

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
so certainly not the worst draw but not

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.629 
so certainly not the worst draw but not
what<00:04:52.300> he<00:04:52.450> needs<00:04:52.690> cuz<00:04:53.380> those<00:04:54.010> pack<00:04:54.250> rats<00:04:54.490> are

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 
what he needs cuz those pack rats are

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:59.310 
what he needs cuz those pack rats are
gonna<00:04:54.789> outpace<00:04:55.240> him<00:04:55.419> very<00:04:55.660> quickly<00:04:58.169> it<00:04:59.169> might

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
gonna outpace him very quickly it might

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.350 
gonna outpace him very quickly it might
be<00:04:59.440> time<00:04:59.650> to<00:05:00.010> chump<00:05:00.310> block<00:05:00.550> area<00:05:00.850> gonna

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
be time to chump block area gonna

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.820 
be time to chump block area gonna
