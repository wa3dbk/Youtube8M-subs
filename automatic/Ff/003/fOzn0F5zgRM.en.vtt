00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.750
 Hello my name is Sergey and you 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.750
 watch serdyuk 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.910
 switch everyone hello dear 

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:24.960
 friends as promised 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:28.180
 public and the next sandboxie video and 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.419
 Today we will talk about the self-made court 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.460
 60 by 60 box 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:35.829
 unlike its predecessor 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.690
 fate with sizes of 100 by 100 this court 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.800
 boxing turned out much better and 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.570
 better and looks basically like 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.090
 shopping softbox and practically nothing 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.950
 no different this homemade soundbox 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.590
 60 by 60 centimeters gives much more 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.700
 light rather than the softbox that we did 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.160
 in the previous video 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.079
 whose dimensions are 1 meter per 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.790
 one meter 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.180
 This soft box was built perfectly 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.920
 other construction of a technique from a hill if 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.409
 you watched the previous video then you 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.329
 probably noticed that the softbox 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.790
 Knitting needles were inserted into special pockets 

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:11.439
 from the outside of the softbox it was not 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.200
 enough to softbox 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:21.009
 stretched uniform and was not 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:23.889
 no waves in this softbox 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:26.079
 construction is completely different needles for 

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:28.749
 the expense of which the whole structure keeps 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:31.179
 is on the inside of the softboxes 

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:34.329
 and run into special pockets 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:37.179
 placed in the corners thereby all 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:41.049
 the sides are evenly stretched and not 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:43.779
 big waves are forming and myself 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:45.520
 softbox does not sag beyond that for 

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:48.039
 ensure stiffness and I added more 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.200
 crossbars and special needles which 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:52.119
 also mounted in special pockets for 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.639
 the edges and in the middle is fixed by velcro 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:55.959
 in order not to give the needles to walk with 

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:59.499
 side to side and sag 

00:01:55.959 --> 00:02:03.810
 this allows our softbox to remain 

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:06.819
 tough during any loads 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.700
 hanging diffuser and other 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:11.440
 will come for example 100 also changes 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.720
 susceptibility box in which 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.599
 light is inserted and into which is inserted 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.740
 all rods she became much thinner 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:21.470
 if in previous 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.320
 sandboxie this box reached the width and 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.790
 thickness of more than 10 centimeters here 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.560
 shortened light version 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.410
 is only six centimeters 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:34.270
 besides this, I decided not to install 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.080
 Three buttons on the body of the box and 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.810
 picked up just one switch 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.310
 which is much cheaper on wire 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.830
 who goes to the softbox 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.900
 however, in the future I plan to add more 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.680
 two buttons to control all 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.510
 bulbs alternately diffuser i 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.370
 I decided to fasten a thinner Velcro 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.360
 whose thickness is not more than two 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:58.720
 centimeters thus I cut more 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:02.600
 long pieces almost full width 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:06.200
 scatterer and he's pretty good and 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:09.470
 evenly stretches the entire diffuser 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.610
 attached to the sides pretty 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.610
 just now I'll show it to you 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.970
 this way our diffuser is mounted 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:29.240
 Now I will demonstrate how it works 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:32.390
 softbox wedding buttons are included 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:35.180
 all the light bulbs and get soft and 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.490
 diffused light in principle that's all i'm 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.890
 wanted to say in this video from the very 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.480
 instructions and all the materials you use 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.430
 can find on my blog 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:48.170
 the link to which you will see in the description 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:51.380
 or on the screen and that's not all 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.210
 as for the softboxes as i promised in 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:57.140
 previous video i will do 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:59.900
 remodeling my boxing trial in sizes 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.150
 1 meter per meter besides this for 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.310
 this softbox i plan to release 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:08.540
 separate video in which I will tell about 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:10.520
 comb and how to make them big 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.110
 Thank you for your attention if you have 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.090
