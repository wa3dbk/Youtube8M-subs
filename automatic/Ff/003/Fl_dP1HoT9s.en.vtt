gallons of water a day hmm and it's just
been<00:00:35.880> spectacular<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:37.050> mean<00:00:37.320> there's<00:00:38.250> some

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
been spectacular I mean there's some

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.030 
been spectacular I mean there's some
drawbacks<00:00:38.899> as<00:00:39.899> compared<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.680> under<00:00:40.950> the

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
drawbacks as compared to the under the

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.799 
drawbacks as compared to the under the
counter<00:00:41.460> ones<00:00:41.700> which<00:00:42.059> are<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.450> know<00:00:42.480> great

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
counter ones which are you know great

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.119 
counter ones which are you know great
because<00:00:43.020> they<00:00:43.140> have<00:00:43.290> their<00:00:43.469> own<00:00:43.500> reservoir

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
because they have their own reservoir

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.770 
because they have their own reservoir
but<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.969> know<00:00:45.059> if<00:00:45.149> you're<00:00:45.270> renting<00:00:45.690> an

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
but you know if you're renting an

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.420 
but you know if you're renting an
apartment<00:00:45.840> or<00:00:46.590> if<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:46.860> don't<00:00:46.950> want<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.250> you

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
apartment or if you don't want to you

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.700 
apartment or if you don't want to you
know<00:00:47.460> modify<00:00:48.030> your<00:00:48.149> existing<00:00:48.600> sink<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.620> know

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
know modify your existing sink you know

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.819 
know modify your existing sink you know
like<00:00:49.920> my<00:00:50.100> sink<00:00:50.430> has<00:00:50.809> it<00:00:51.809> has<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.020> sprayer<00:00:52.559> in

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
like my sink has it has a sprayer in

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.799 
like my sink has it has a sprayer in
there<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.399> then<00:00:53.520> no<00:00:53.699> hole<00:00:54.000> on<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.360> other<00:00:54.480> side

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
there and then no hole on the other side

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.049 
there and then no hole on the other side
so<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.140> couldn't<00:00:55.530> I'd<00:00:55.980> have<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.340> cut<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.579> hole<00:00:56.640> to

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
so I couldn't I'd have to cut a hole to

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.510 
so I couldn't I'd have to cut a hole to
install<00:00:57.510> him<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:58.530> know<00:00:58.649> tapped<00:00:59.039> for<00:00:59.309> one<00:00:59.430> of

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
install him you know tapped for one of

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.700 
install him you know tapped for one of
those<00:00:59.640> under<00:00:59.910> counter<00:01:00.359> ones<00:01:00.539> so<00:01:01.230> anyway<00:01:01.680> I

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
those under counter ones so anyway I

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.969 
those under counter ones so anyway I
just<00:01:01.800> got<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.280> countertop<00:01:03.120> one<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.979> compared

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
just got the countertop one and compared

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.580 
just got the countertop one and compared
to<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.600> under<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.720> counter<00:01:07.080> ones<00:01:07.320> they're

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
to the under the counter ones they're

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.410 
to the under the counter ones they're
just<00:01:07.860> they're<00:01:08.430> actually<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.760> little<00:01:08.939> cheaper

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
just they're actually a little cheaper

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.640 
just they're actually a little cheaper
and<00:01:10.850> they're<00:01:12.049> you<00:01:13.049> know<00:01:13.080> they're<00:01:13.200> just<00:01:13.470> easy

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
and they're you know they're just easy

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.830 
and they're you know they're just easy
to<00:01:13.740> take<00:01:14.010> with<00:01:14.250> you<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:15.060> basically<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.600> way<00:01:15.630> it

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
to take with you so basically the way it

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.050 
to take with you so basically the way it
works<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:16.290> this<00:01:16.470> is<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.830> unit<00:01:17.159> itself<00:01:17.520> here

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
works is this is the unit itself here

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.170 
works is this is the unit itself here
it's<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.780> four<00:01:19.320> stage<00:01:19.590> filter<00:01:20.330> and<00:01:21.330> then<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:21.930> has

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
it's a four stage filter and then it has

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.760 
it's a four stage filter and then it has
this<00:01:24.180> piece<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.810> connects<00:01:25.140> right<00:01:25.409> on<00:01:25.590> your

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
this piece that connects right on your

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.620 
this piece that connects right on your
faucet<00:01:26.369> that's<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.670> universal<00:01:26.939> amount

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
faucet that's a universal amount

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.810 
faucet that's a universal amount
connects<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.110> any<00:01:28.200> faucet<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.920> then<00:01:29.490> it's

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
connects to any faucet and then it's

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.230 
connects to any faucet and then it's
kind<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.540> like<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.259> from<00:01:31.970> like<00:01:32.970> tube

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
kind of like a to and from like tube

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.710 
kind of like a to and from like tube
that<00:01:33.780> goes<00:01:33.840> both<00:01:34.259> ways<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.979> um<00:01:35.570> so<00:01:36.570> your

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
that goes both ways that um so your

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.990 
that goes both ways that um so your
wastewater<00:01:37.110> comes<00:01:37.560> out<00:01:37.740> here<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.310> then<00:01:38.880> it

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
wastewater comes out here and then it

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.219 
wastewater comes out here and then it
takes<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.420> water<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.990> filter<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.710> send<00:01:42.049> to<00:01:43.049> the

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
takes the water to filter to send to the

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.130 
takes the water to filter to send to the
filter<00:01:43.590> all<00:01:43.829> in<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.220> same<00:01:44.460> tube<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.750> basically

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
filter all in the same tube so basically

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.819 
filter all in the same tube so basically
it<00:01:46.320> comes<00:01:47.659> through<00:01:48.659> here<00:01:48.750> through<00:01:49.320> this<00:01:49.439> unit

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
it comes through here through this unit

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.090 
it comes through here through this unit
through<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.130> four<00:01:50.369> stages<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:51.030> then<00:01:51.860> you<00:01:52.860> get

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
through the four stages and then you get

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.219 
through the four stages and then you get
this<00:01:53.280> sort<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:53.729> like<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:53.970> feed<00:01:54.659> tube<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:55.110> the

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
this sort of like a feed tube that the

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.899 
this sort of like a feed tube that the
clean<00:01:55.470> water<00:01:55.710> comes<00:01:55.979> out<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.579> then

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
clean water comes out of and then

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.639

when you factor in the filters and
everything<00:03:32.739> for<00:03:33.739> one<00:03:33.920> of<00:03:34.010> these<00:03:34.130> units<00:03:34.609> you

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
everything for one of these units you

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.819 
everything for one of these units you
know<00:03:35.000> which<00:03:35.209> is<00:03:35.450> really<00:03:36.019> cheap<00:03:36.230> when<00:03:36.739> you

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
know which is really cheap when you

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:38.470 
know which is really cheap when you
compare<00:03:37.160> that<00:03:37.190> to<00:03:37.370> bottled<00:03:37.850> water<00:03:38.090> which<00:03:38.329> is

over the course of a year you'll save
almost<00:04:13.840> $900<00:04:14.840> you<00:04:15.170> know<00:04:15.260> compared<00:04:15.650> to<00:04:15.709> bottled

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
almost $900 you know compared to bottled

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.420 
almost $900 you know compared to bottled
water<00:04:16.510> which<00:04:17.510> is<00:04:17.720> uh<00:04:18.010> spectacular<00:04:19.039> I<00:04:19.130> mean<00:04:19.310> it

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
water which is uh spectacular I mean it

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:20.800 
water which is uh spectacular I mean it
definitely<00:04:19.789> pays<00:04:19.970> for<00:04:20.180> itself<00:04:20.419> in<00:04:20.630> like<00:04:20.750> a

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
definitely pays for itself in like a

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.290 
definitely pays for itself in like a
couple<00:04:21.200> of<00:04:21.289> months<00:04:21.669> the<00:04:22.669> maintenance<00:04:23.120> is

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
couple of months the maintenance is

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.030 
couple of months the maintenance is
really<00:04:23.479> low<00:04:23.780> basically<00:04:24.409> you<00:04:24.530> just<00:04:24.560> change

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
really low basically you just change

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.200 
really low basically you just change
-<00:04:25.160> filters<00:04:25.610> um<00:04:27.130> once<00:04:28.130> every<00:04:28.460> six<00:04:28.700> months<00:04:28.790> I

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
- filters um once every six months I

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.150 
- filters um once every six months I
think<00:04:29.480> and<00:04:29.810> it's<00:04:29.930> like<00:04:30.050> 30<00:04:30.290> dollars<00:04:30.710> to<00:04:31.010> change

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
think and it's like 30 dollars to change

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.920 
think and it's like 30 dollars to change
the<00:04:31.370> filters<00:04:31.730> you<00:04:32.060> know<00:04:32.180> which<00:04:32.390> is<00:04:32.540> really<00:04:32.810> not

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
the filters you know which is really not

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.880 
the filters you know which is really not
a<00:04:32.990> big<00:04:33.170> deal<00:04:33.230> and<00:04:34.150> and<00:04:35.230> that's<00:04:36.230> it<00:04:36.440> so<00:04:36.650> go<00:04:36.830> to

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
a big deal and and that's it so go to

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.390 
a big deal and and that's it so go to
countertop<00:04:37.430> reverse<00:04:37.760> osmosis<00:04:38.710> com2<00:04:39.740> to<00:04:40.220> get
