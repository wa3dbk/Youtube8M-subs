00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.500
 welcome to the dotcom detector world 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.020
 today we are going to see the characteristics and 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.550
 operation of the euroace gard 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.660
 garetto euroace would be the european version 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.950
 the metal detector 350 makes the 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.869
 main differences that it has 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.030
 with respect to the previous model that if 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.669
 burst two hundred fifty would be 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:35.580
 a larger plate a double plate of 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.530
 22 x 28 centimeters and a resolution of 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.629
 improved iron is to say more pixels 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.640
 to be able to identify the different 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.070
 Iron targets if it seems good 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.610
 let's move on to see the features 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.110
 from the control panel 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.110
 let's turn on the director 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.620
 and we have five modes mode 0 that 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.780
 would be equivalent to all metal and this wants 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.489
 say that our sector is going to whistle 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.489
 before any type of metal 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:11.220
 we have then the coins mode 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:16.340
 This mode is used to search 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.340
 coins eliminating garbage and aluminum 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.390
 We ix mode or relics this 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.399
 mode removes iron pieces and detects 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.799
 low conductivity goals like 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:28.799
 It can be copper lead or bronze 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.990
 the jewelry mode in this way is used 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.850
 for finding rings watches 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.890
 collars etc 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.220
 eliminating nails and small pieces of 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.220
 iron 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.300
 the custo mode this mode is the mode 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.330
 customized by the user that we 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:54.640
 allows to accept or reject any of 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.640
 the 12 pixels of the lower scale 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.969
 For this we use the 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.750
 the controls plus minus the button 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.750
 discrimination 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.810
 here we can activate or deactivate the 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.310
 different segments for it 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.310
 we would use the bottom button 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.960
 imagine that we have lost an earring 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.970
 and we have the second unit 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.710
 to find what we would do is that 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.080
 we would pass in front of the plate the 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.390
 pending we have left 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.390
 we would fix the pixel that has been 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.990
 active and we would reject the rest of the 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.520
 pixels 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.520
 we would do it in the following way 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:56.010
 in this way we would focus the search 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.409
 only on the slope 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.120
 We can use the controls more less 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:02.610
 of the discrimination button in all 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.739
 modes but is in the custom mode the only 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.599
 in which when you turn off and on the 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.840
 detector we keep our 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:11.579
 preferences if we want to reset the 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.500
 factory values we keep pressed 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:15.870
 for five seconds the button 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.019
 on until we hear a double 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.019
 bit 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.470
 let's see the function of the controls 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.720
 of sensitivity we recommend keeping the 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.190
 sensitivity to the maximum level so 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.930
 to be able to take advantage of the greater depth 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.930
 that the detector can offer us 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.060
 it is not always possible to maintain the maximum 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.580
 our sensitivity levels 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.470
 having to reduce it to some level 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.180
 this happens in circumstances like 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.670
 can be terrain is highly 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:48.090
 mineralized with the salt water of the 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.040
 beaches in places where there is excessive 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.020
 iron waste or in the presence of 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.440
 other detectors that work with the 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.440
 same frequency 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.830
 the ping point or identification button 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.410
 exact objectives is very useful 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.300
 since it will prevent us from making holes 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.000
 too wide in the field to 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.050
 locate a target when the detector 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.840
 he gives us a notice that he has located 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.790
 something we will place the plate on the area and 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.740
 keep the button Ping 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.290
 points without releasing it and making a 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:21.170
 movement in the form of X from side to 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.910
 side and from front to back in this way 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.480
 we will know the exact place where 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.480
 we have to finish 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.770
 on the screen when we are located 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:52.260
 just above the object will light up from 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.210
 left to right all the pixels and 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:58.460
 the sound will reach the maximum intensity 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.460
 The closer we get to the objective 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.750
 now let's see the euro does in action 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:28.080
 we are faced with a little object 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:30.030
 Ferrous found at 15 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.539
 centimeters between 15 and 20 centimeters of 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.539
 depth 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:42.039
 the best way to know how our 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.800
 detector responds to the different 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:47.249
 metals is passing objects ahead 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.249
 from the dish 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:04.449
 Our detector has three shades of 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.479
 different audio 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:09.340
 ferrous objects of low conductivity 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:11.849
 nails and irons activate the pixels 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:14.039
 located to the left of the scale 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:17.000
 Measurement objects conductivity as 

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:19.520
 small coins sound like this 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.500
 Non-ferrous objects with high 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.870
 conductivity produce a tone of 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.380
 bell and activate the segments of the 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.380
 Right part 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.830
 as we said before the club 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.570
 euroace has a resolution to improve the 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:39.870
 iron what allows us to have a 

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:41.640
 greater control over these objectives if 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:43.620
 it seems you're going to move on to some example 

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:46.560
 in which this characteristic of 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:48.210
 detector can be useful to us 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.400
 in relics mode we can 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:53.070
 find a metal wire or trash 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.470
 if we want to cancel the pixel of this type 

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:57.210
 of objectives we can do it using the 

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:58.800
 controls plus minus button 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:01.470
 discrimination 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:03.060
 as we can see the euroace gaga no longer 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:05.849
 it sounds when we pass this kind of 

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:07.500
 objectives now if we go ahead 

00:07:05.849 --> 00:07:09.840
 of a ferrous object that interests us 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:11.759
 How can our currency be 

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:14.699
 detector will indicate us that we are 

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:16.710
 with a good objective in certain 

00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:18.780
 Sometimes we can find an object 

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:21.300
 iron garbage next to another object that 

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:23.849
 we can be interested in this case 

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:26.759
 produces a combined conductivity of 

00:07:23.849 --> 00:07:28.860
 both objects always prevailing on 

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:31.759
 of greater conductivity than our case 

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.759
 it would be the currency 

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.380
 two scales appear on the screen 1 

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:43.450
 lower 

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:45.340
 it would be this and it shows us the 

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:46.870
 discrimination setting that 

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:50.140
 we have selected with the different 

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:53.770
 modes and then an upper one that would be 

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:55.630
 This shows us according to the 

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:58.470
 segment that illuminates when passing a 

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:58.470
 metal ahead 

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:02.820
 would indicate the type of metal that 

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:04.470
 we are trying in this case we have 

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:07.009
 detected a conductivity object 

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:07.009
 half
