00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:10.160
 sharing in the cockpit is time to wake up 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:19.289
 every day and the pilots in the world 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.480
 whole subject undergo the most varied 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.670
 work conditions 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.109
 the slaves based on needs 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.750
 market 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.019
 the constant changes in conditions of 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.629
 to recover the frequent changes of climate 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.420
 and time zone and power supply that the 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:39.269
 stress is inherent to the profession may 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.589
 take the pilots' commanders to a 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:45.690
 mental and physical state far from ideal 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:48.860
 in Apac that was his help to 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:53.100
 identify how fatigue and drowsiness 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:55.469
 are affecting the aeronauts in Brazil 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.399
 because it's time to wake up for this 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.160
 problem 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.760
 a problem that involves their quality 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:06.720
 and safety of the aircraft that you 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.649
 leads apac in Brazilian association 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.000
 of civil aviation pilots appeared in 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:13.740
 2011 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.149
 idealized and directed by pilots of 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.700
 Airlines 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:20.759
 the objective of promoting the safety of 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.220
 flight and enhancement of the profession 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.560
 since then we have acted together with 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.679
 authorities and entities of civil aviation 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.649
 in the search for better conditions for 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:35.700
 aeronauts always strong foundation 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:37.920
 technical expert already 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.819
 several achievements at the congress 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.479
 national 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:44.460
 other government agencies and it is by 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.360
 this we need in your collaboration 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.539
 of emphatic specialists 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.610
 drowsiness to prepare a questionnaire to 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:57.030
 be answered by the largest number 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.610
 pilots questions about 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.090
 factors that have never before been evaluated 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.740
 so specific will be based on the 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.489
 answers we can identify 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:11.430
 risk situations and faxinal 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.630
 thus failing our actions in search of 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.510
 security 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:19.530
 and the quality of life of those who command 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:23.460
 aircraft to participate and respond to 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:27.810
 questions and an email to search the 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:29.880
 clothing and students point org should not take 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.410
 more than 30 minutes 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:37.080
 the data is confidential and you will not be 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.510
 identified moon shape at the end you 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.620
 have access to all the results of the 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:46.070
 research on fatigue drowsiness 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:50.040
 unpublished initiative in Brazilian aviation 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:53.280
 in their participation is critical to 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.790
 who everyone in our country says lose to 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.790
 this question
