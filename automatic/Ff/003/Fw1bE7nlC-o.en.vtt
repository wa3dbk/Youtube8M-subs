00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:08.260
 appreciable cybernaut today we are going to 

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:10.809
 teach how the seed is extracted from a 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.570
 manila mango and its germinated first 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:16.390
 the manila mango is eaten and the 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:19.210
 bone inside that bone is 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.300
 the seed opens carefully the bone 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:25.060
 without affecting the seed that is inside 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:28.330
 of the bone the seed is covered with 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:32.619
 one with a cascarita a slight cascarita 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:35.410
 well that does not matter that seed is 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:38.680
 deposits a container in a container 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:42.610
 similar to this truth a vessel 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:46.300
 which can be paper or plastic is covered 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:49.190
 with some fertile land or land of 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.760
 pot or compost 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.399
 the seed that looks like this look with 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.190
 tonic caritas and you can appreciate it is 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.909
 with todd and cascarita is deposited in this 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:04.339
 container is poured some ground 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:06.420
 a little bit of water is sprayed 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.720
 true 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.900
 every week I'm not swimming there 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.810
 water but that is moistened look 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.229
 they can realize they are already germinating 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:22.229
 these seeds are a little bit more 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.610
 other medium girls and already even a 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:28.550
 It's already great 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.640
 what you have to do is that 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:35.000
 they have to cover it with fertile soil or 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:38.090
 land of pots that sell in the 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.090
 mall or in the tianguis or 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.030
 compost prepared that compost is 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.479
 prepare with organic waste 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.670
 truly rested for a month by 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.710
 anticipated with a little moisture a 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.280
 once covered the seed is sprayed with 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:58.820
 a little water every week and rest 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:02.170
 in a dark place waiting 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:05.420
 about a month if you realize 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.530
 not all the seeds germinated or are going to 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.860
 take a little longer 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:13.220
 it is advisable to germinate several as I 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:17.620
 I just made it look are several and some 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:20.300
 already finished and others have not germinated 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.280
 observe truth that there are the 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.260
 some seeds are not even 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.140
 covered with earth maybe that's why 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.600
 I do not know I do not know they did not finish but it's already going 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.740
 if they realize it already has its small 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.130
 root 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.390
 there is his little root but that 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.610
 small root 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:41.390
 Well, it means that if it is 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.330
 making a good effect because I throw a 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:47.330
 little bit more land this is land 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.860
 natural see the natural earth is earth 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.820
 natural 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.740
 It is potted earth and well it gets 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.330
 in a dark place he is sprayed 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.700
 little water that is not missing every 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.640
 week and well it will take 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.280
 about a month to start 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.980
 to see the germinated and they will see their 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:11.180
 little leaves like the ones you are looking at is a 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.940
 Well manila tree , I recommend you 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.010
 true that there are several that you deposit 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.390
 in a place so you do not stay 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.520
 disappointed 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.370
 I also recommend that what 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:25.040
 Transplants before being in a place 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.770
 definitive planting in a pot or 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.350
 puts in a place of shadow in a place 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:33.050
 with shadow so it will not dry 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.700
 your little plant is not going to resent that 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.510
 hit the sun because if not all of these 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:41.030
 little leaves are going to fall are going to fall and not 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.580
 we want them to die after a 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.650
 month of being struggling well 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.840
 we already have the little plant 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.409
 true for two months they leave in a 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:54.079
 this place that does not lack water and in 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:56.510
 shade in a place where there is shade that 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:58.549
 there is a little more light when the 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.189
 always when the plantings look for a 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:04.340
 large place because it is a large tree and 

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:08.840
 leafy with large roots, well 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:12.079
 I wish you a good day is all that 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:15.290
 I can mention them is the way 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:19.220
 how my seeds germinate like the 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:21.709
 I extracted and how the bases of the germinate 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.470
 with a little dirt and a little water 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:27.400
 Well, that's all good, because I 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.400
 dismissal bye
