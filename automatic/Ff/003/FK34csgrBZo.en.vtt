00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.869
 hey people hello 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.460
 Today I wanted to show you how to do it 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.939
 more memory for the minecraft server 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.849
 You can assign and you know it 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.520
 probably the following problem 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:36.840
 started the server with the minecraft 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:42.300
 server point excel and you then already 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:45.510
 the 48 of the memory already 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.370
 is occupied and that usually leads to 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.230
 if several people are on it or something 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.719
 that then someday the 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.300
 error message out of memory or junk 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.850
 errors et cetera arise 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:01.160
 To prevent that, do the following 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.809
 first finally the server again 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.060
 you press the right mouse button in the 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.350
 folder probably the server is and opens 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:17.970
 new then goes to text document and 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:21.450
 then writes start point bad file so in 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.080
 about no I do not want to change moment 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.080
 that was a mistake 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:32.299
 Starting point and the last point behind 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:35.040
 Do not want to make the changes on the way 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:37.860
 I want so now you have the file 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.939
 Starting point is parked and now does the following 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.340
 is here presses the right mouse button 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:46.680
 and goes to edit and then adds 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.369
 following following code below 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.880
 text on 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:54.450
 I have already prepared and 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.570
 although would have to stand then program files 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.460
 So depending on which hard drive 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:04.680
 you have mostly it is c double 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:06.299
 point and then that in java order the 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.690
 is very important so where java 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:12.599
 where is installed virtually where this file 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.940
 to find you is in java folder there 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:21.870
 will then according to the lead after 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:24.810
 Gänsefüßchen this indicated this 1024th 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.270
 ie 1024 megabytes will be the 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.209
 server now assigned as virtual 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.709
 Storage 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:37.860
 as soon as you do that, you open 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:40.860
 save file ready so if you now 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.920
 now the city ​​of bad file starts it is 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.140
 a windows patch file then you will 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.110
 Immediately see that the server starts 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:52.230
 quite normal as if you have this file 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.150
 would have started minecraft excel and 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.209
 mary hughes is just here 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:01.379
 five percent so 95 percent are still 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:03.120
 normally free now 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:06.709
 actually not this problem anymore 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.269
 that happen any people 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:12.959
 any thanks problems etc so 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:15.680
 have okay if it worked for you 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:19.319
 I would be happy about comments 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.239
 gives a simple feedback and then 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:24.800
 I would say 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.800
