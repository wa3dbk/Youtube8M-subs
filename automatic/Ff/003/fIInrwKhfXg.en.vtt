00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
once you get the hang of it you'll be

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.570 
once you get the hang of it you'll be
able<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.490> pop<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:50.729> out<00:01:51.030> 1<00:01:51.360> 2<00:01:51.540> 3

can pick a play you hit start you got a
quick<00:03:05.770> game<00:03:06.480> quit<00:03:07.480> the<00:03:07.630> game<00:03:07.810> and<00:03:08.970> then<00:03:09.970> wait

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
quick game quit the game and then wait

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.650 
quick game quit the game and then wait
to<00:03:10.390> get<00:03:10.510> back<00:03:10.720> and<00:03:11.019> I<00:03:11.560> had<00:03:12.209> 18600<00:03:13.209> inning<00:03:13.480> I

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
to get back and I had 18600 inning I

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.600 
to get back and I had 18600 inning I
should<00:03:14.110> have<00:03:14.320> twenty<00:03:14.739> thousand<00:03:15.280> six<00:03:15.489> hundred

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
should have twenty thousand six hundred

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.380 
should have twenty thousand six hundred
and<00:03:15.850> eight<00:03:16.030> so<00:03:16.980> pretty<00:03:17.980> simple<00:03:18.489> I<00:03:18.640> think<00:03:18.670> that

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
and eight so pretty simple I think that

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.500 
and eight so pretty simple I think that
only<00:03:19.510> took<00:03:19.750> about<00:03:19.810> three<00:03:20.440> minutes<00:03:20.650> to<00:03:20.980> do<00:03:21.510> so

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
only took about three minutes to do so

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.750 
only took about three minutes to do so
yeah<00:03:22.930> that's<00:03:23.560> pretty<00:03:24.070> much<00:03:24.220> how<00:03:24.310> to<00:03:24.489> do<00:03:24.640> it

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
yeah that's pretty much how to do it

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.070 
yeah that's pretty much how to do it
really<00:03:25.000> simple<00:03:25.900> and<00:03:26.200> easy<00:03:26.610> so<00:03:27.610> as<00:03:27.970> we're<00:03:28.959> going

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
really simple and easy so as we're going

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.420 
really simple and easy so as we're going
