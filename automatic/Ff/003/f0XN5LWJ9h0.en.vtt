hello and welcome in this video I am

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.430 
hello and welcome in this video I am
going<00:00:03.639> to<00:00:03.760> demonstrate<00:00:04.030> how<00:00:04.390> easy<00:00:04.780> it<00:00:05.050> is<00:00:05.110> to

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:05.440 
going to demonstrate how easy it is to

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.750 
going to demonstrate how easy it is to
take<00:00:05.620> a<00:00:05.680> clipart<00:00:06.900> JPEG<00:00:07.900> logo<00:00:08.440> and<00:00:08.920> convert<00:00:09.580> it

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:09.760 
take a clipart JPEG logo and convert it

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.350 
take a clipart JPEG logo and convert it
into<00:00:10.030> the<00:00:10.600> necessary<00:00:11.170> drawing<00:00:12.040> so<00:00:12.640> we<00:00:12.820> can<00:00:13.090> cut

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:13.360 
into the necessary drawing so we can cut

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.149 
into the necessary drawing so we can cut
it<00:00:13.480> out<00:00:13.630> on<00:00:13.960> a<00:00:13.990> CNC<00:00:14.500> plasma<00:00:15.340> burn<00:00:15.910> table<00:00:17.159> here's

00:00:18.149 --> 00:00:18.159 
it out on a CNC plasma burn table here's

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:23.460 
it out on a CNC plasma burn table here's
our<00:00:18.310> logo<00:00:18.900> as<00:00:19.900> you<00:00:20.470> can<00:00:20.619> see<00:00:20.800> the<00:00:22.199> it's<00:00:23.199> a<00:00:23.259> very

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:23.470 
our logo as you can see the it's a very

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.470 
our logo as you can see the it's a very
colorful<00:00:23.890> logo<00:00:24.039> but<00:00:24.550> the<00:00:24.789> program<00:00:25.089> won't<00:00:25.300> have

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
colorful logo but the program won't have

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.470 
colorful logo but the program won't have
any<00:00:25.720> problem<00:00:26.079> with<00:00:26.199> it<00:00:26.550> let's<00:00:27.550> go<00:00:27.669> to<00:00:27.699> our<00:00:27.819> cat

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
any problem with it let's go to our cat

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.279 
any problem with it let's go to our cat
what<00:00:29.109> we<00:00:29.199> do<00:00:29.380> is<00:00:29.499> file<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:31.210> dries

00:00:34.279 --> 00:00:34.289 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:37.200 

when<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.829> pic<00:00:35.129> are

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
when a pic are

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:43.590 
when a pic are
image

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.750 

then<00:00:43.750> what<00:00:44.230> we<00:00:44.350> do<00:00:44.530> is<00:00:44.829> basically<00:00:45.160> tell<00:00:45.609> how

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
then what we do is basically tell how

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.420 
then what we do is basically tell how
many<00:00:45.820> colors<00:00:46.269> and<00:00:47.109> we<00:00:47.230> want<00:00:47.410> it<00:00:47.500> to<00:00:47.620> use<00:00:47.829> the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
many colors and we want it to use the

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.479 
many colors and we want it to use the
dispatcher<00:00:48.879> level<00:00:49.390> and<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.890> spec<00:00:51.129> level

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
dispatcher level and the spec level

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.270 
dispatcher level and the spec level
basically<00:00:52.089> tells<00:00:52.360> it<00:00:52.570> how<00:00:52.949> closely<00:00:53.949> to<00:00:54.039> follow

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
basically tells it how closely to follow

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.970 
basically tells it how closely to follow
the<00:00:54.430> picture<00:00:54.730> of<00:00:54.909> pixels<00:00:55.359> of<00:00:55.539> the<00:00:55.629> picture

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
the picture of pixels of the picture

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.479 
the picture of pixels of the picture
that<00:00:56.980> dries<00:00:57.280> it<00:00:57.550> looks<00:00:57.870> good<00:00:58.870> and<00:00:59.680> I<00:01:00.010> can<00:01:00.190> hit

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
that dries it looks good and I can hit

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.439 
that dries it looks good and I can hit
OK<00:01:00.879> and<00:01:01.120> it's<00:01:01.570> going<00:01:01.719> to<00:01:01.780> open<00:01:02.049> it<00:01:02.320> up<00:01:02.500> in<00:01:03.190> the

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
OK and it's going to open it up in the

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:10.770 
OK and it's going to open it up in the
the<00:01:04.449> cat<00:01:04.690> system<00:01:05.170> next<00:01:06.039> let's<00:01:06.789> draw<00:01:07.390> a<00:01:08.220> oval<00:01:09.780> so

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
the cat system next let's draw a oval so

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.060 
the cat system next let's draw a oval so
we<00:01:10.930> can<00:01:11.080> cut<00:01:11.380> this<00:01:11.560> out

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.440 

and<00:01:14.520> then<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:14.850> can<00:01:15.390> move<00:01:15.800> the<00:01:16.800> oval

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
and then I can move the oval

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.620 
and then I can move the oval
so<00:01:19.110> it's<00:01:19.259> centered<00:01:20.030> armadillo<00:01:21.030> centered<00:01:21.479> and

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
so it's centered armadillo centered and

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.740 
so it's centered armadillo centered and
Noble<00:01:22.040> now<00:01:23.040> what<00:01:23.400> we<00:01:23.549> can<00:01:23.729> do<00:01:23.939> is<00:01:26.750> right-click

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
Noble now what we can do is right-click

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.700 
Noble now what we can do is right-click
this<00:01:28.670> a1<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:30.119> could<00:01:30.299> spine<00:01:30.600> fit<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.530> it

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
this a1 I could spine fit it so it

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.090 
this a1 I could spine fit it so it
smoothes<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.159> out<00:01:33.140> also<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.649> wanted<00:01:35.039> to

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
smoothes it out also I wanted to

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.990 
smoothes it out also I wanted to
right-click

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.180 

this<00:01:39.300> way<00:01:39.750> so<00:01:40.020> program<00:01:40.440> knows<00:01:40.680> it's<00:01:40.950> one

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
this way so program knows it's one

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.570 
this way so program knows it's one
complete<00:01:41.670> part<00:01:42.590> so<00:01:43.590> that's<00:01:43.770> our<00:01:43.950> that's<00:01:44.310> how

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
complete part so that's our that's how

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:45.320 
complete part so that's our that's how
easy<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:44.970> is

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
easy it is

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.930 
easy it is
took<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.630> logo<00:01:45.990> put<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:46.800> apart<00:01:47.130> let's<00:01:47.760> say<00:01:47.910> I

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
took a logo put it apart let's say I

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.350 
took a logo put it apart let's say I
want<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:49.340> you<00:01:50.340> know<00:01:50.460> cut<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.729> whole<00:01:50.940> sheet<00:01:51.210> of

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
want to you know cut a whole sheet of

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.900 
want to you know cut a whole sheet of
these<00:01:51.540> out<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.050> this<00:01:52.530> needs<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.830> be<00:01:52.979> 12<00:01:53.310> by<00:01:53.610> 6

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
these out and this needs to be 12 by 6

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.300 
these out and this needs to be 12 by 6
inches<00:01:54.240> tall<00:01:54.540> so<00:01:55.200> what<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.410> do<00:01:55.530> first<00:01:55.860> is<00:01:56.130> soived

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
inches tall so what I do first is soived

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.609 
inches tall so what I do first is soived
it<00:01:56.670> use<00:01:57.540> my<00:01:57.780> scale<00:01:58.380> function<00:01:58.619> and<00:02:00.619> basically

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
it use my scale function and basically

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.140 
it use my scale function and basically
tell<00:02:01.830> it<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:02.160> needs<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.520> be<00:02:02.550> 12<00:02:02.850> by<00:02:03.090> 6<00:02:03.440> hit<00:02:04.440> OK

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
tell it that needs to be 12 by 6 hit OK

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.889 
tell it that needs to be 12 by 6 hit OK
and<00:02:06.150> as<00:02:06.660> you<00:02:06.840> can<00:02:07.020> see<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.320> shrunk<00:02:07.800> it<00:02:08.009> down<00:02:08.899> now

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
and as you can see it shrunk it down now

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.070 
and as you can see it shrunk it down now
let's<00:02:10.350> draw<00:02:11.100> a<00:02:11.310> rectangle<00:02:11.870> that's<00:02:12.870> in

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
let's draw a rectangle that's in

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.760 
let's draw a rectangle that's in
reference<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.560> our<00:02:13.709> four<00:02:14.220> by<00:02:14.340> eight<00:02:14.370> sheet

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.630 

this<00:02:18.250> way<00:02:18.550> we<00:02:18.910> can<00:02:19.090> Rhea<00:02:19.360> it<00:02:19.950> so<00:02:20.950> that<00:02:21.160> the

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.490 

the<00:02:24.120> sign<00:02:24.450> is<00:02:24.780> can<00:02:25.380> put<00:02:25.560> covered<00:02:26.400> with<00:02:26.580> the

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
the sign is can put covered with the

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.770 
the sign is can put covered with the
other<00:02:28.500> she<00:02:28.800> is<00:02:28.890> covered<00:02:29.220> with<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.460> signs<00:02:29.750> so<00:02:30.750> I

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
other she is covered with the signs so I

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.780 
other she is covered with the signs so I
select<00:02:31.260> it<00:02:31.700> you<00:02:32.700> use<00:02:32.850> my<00:02:33.030> array<00:02:33.240> function

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
select it you use my array function

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.929 
select it you use my array function
tell<00:02:35.390> it<00:02:35.420> to<00:02:35.780> where<00:02:35.930> to<00:02:36.140> start<00:02:36.549> the<00:02:37.549> rate<00:02:37.760> at

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:37.939 
tell it to where to start the rate at

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:41.949 
tell it to where to start the rate at
which<00:02:37.969> is<00:02:38.329> zero<00:02:38.569> zero

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.699 

and<00:02:42.890> then<00:02:43.099> I<00:02:44.019> tell<00:02:45.019> it<00:02:45.109> how<00:02:45.200> many<00:02:45.349> rows<00:02:45.530> and

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
and then I tell it how many rows and

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:46.179 
and then I tell it how many rows and
columns

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:48.859 
I usually overdo it to and then I could

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:51.280 
I usually overdo it to and then I could
just<00:02:48.890> delete<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.430> overlap<00:02:49.909> and<00:02:50.209> hit<00:02:50.719> okay<00:02:51.079> and

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
just delete the overlap and hit okay and

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.589 
just delete the overlap and hit okay and
as<00:02:51.590> you<00:02:51.620> can<00:02:51.890> see<00:02:52.099> it<00:02:53.950> copies<00:02:54.950> them<00:02:55.159> out<00:02:55.420> then<00:02:56.420> I

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
as you can see it copies them out then I

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:58.119 
as you can see it copies them out then I
could<00:02:56.780> just<00:02:56.930> select<00:02:57.109> the<00:02:57.379> ones<00:02:57.560> I<00:02:57.709> don't<00:02:57.890> need

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:58.129 
could just select the ones I don't need

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:04.580 
could just select the ones I don't need
and<00:02:58.549> delete<00:02:59.450> them

and<00:03:05.069> then<00:03:05.160> after<00:03:05.400> that<00:03:05.520> I<00:03:05.790> just<00:03:06.060> delete<00:03:06.390> the

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
and then after that I just delete the

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.070 
and then after that I just delete the
reference<00:03:07.770> rectangle<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:08.459> this<00:03:09.060> is<00:03:09.270> ready<00:03:09.840> to

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
go to the next step so I'll follow

go to the next step so I'll follow
export<00:03:13.050> a<00:03:13.260> DXF

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:28.830 

name<00:03:18.780> it

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.080 

and<00:03:29.230> then<00:03:29.440> go<00:03:29.590> to<00:03:29.650> my<00:03:29.890> camp<00:03:30.190> program<00:03:30.610> where<00:03:31.060> I

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
and then go to my camp program where I

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:46.340 
and then go to my camp program where I
simply<00:03:31.599> follow<00:03:31.870> and<00:03:32.410> import<00:03:33.040> the<00:03:33.160> drawing

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:52.559 

then<00:03:47.350> I<00:03:47.740> basically<00:03:48.900> take<00:03:49.900> my<00:03:51.270> operation<00:03:52.270> here

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
then I basically take my operation here

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.520 
then I basically take my operation here
you<00:03:53.560> know<00:03:53.680> outside<00:03:53.860> offset<00:03:54.630> tell<00:03:55.630> it<00:03:55.780> what

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
you know outside offset tell it what

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.980 
you know outside offset tell it what
later<00:03:56.740> to<00:03:56.920> use<00:03:57.160> what<00:03:57.760> tool<00:03:58.030> to<00:03:58.209> use<00:03:58.450> which<00:03:58.840> I'm

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:58.990 
later to use what tool to use which I'm

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.930 
later to use what tool to use which I'm
going<00:03:59.110> to<00:03:59.200> use<00:03:59.319> as<00:03:59.470> a<00:03:59.500> 10-gauge<00:03:59.980> brings<00:04:00.730> in<00:04:00.850> the

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
ends and lead outs and I hit okay as you

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.120 
ends and lead outs and I hit okay as you
can<00:04:06.280> see

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
can see

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.960 
can see
they<00:04:08.490> puts<00:04:08.760> all<00:04:08.970> the<00:04:09.150> start<00:04:09.450> points<00:04:09.960> and<00:04:10.970> shows

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
they puts all the start points and shows

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:12.830 
they puts all the start points and shows
you<00:04:12.180> the<00:04:12.330> toolpath

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
you the toolpath

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.810 
you the toolpath
of<00:04:13.170> what<00:04:13.470> it's<00:04:13.650> going<00:04:13.740> to<00:04:13.890> cut<00:04:14.160> so<00:04:14.460> here's<00:04:14.640> your

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
of what it's going to cut so here's your

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.820 
of what it's going to cut so here's your
lead-in<00:04:15.000> laid<00:04:15.810> out<00:04:15.990> and<00:04:16.230> it<00:04:16.290> shows<00:04:16.530> you<00:04:16.680> the

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
lead-in laid out and it shows you the

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:20.330 
lead-in laid out and it shows you the
direction<00:04:17.370> and<00:04:17.670> this<00:04:18.480> is<00:04:18.540> ready<00:04:18.930> to<00:04:19.050> go

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
direction and this is ready to go

ten table so four by eight sheet will
fit<00:04:24.630> on<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:24.840> table<00:04:24.990> just<00:04:25.320> fine<00:04:25.620> and<00:04:26.550> then<00:04:26.730> I

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
fit on the table just fine and then I

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.880 
fit on the table just fine and then I
basically<00:04:27.050> post-process<00:04:28.050> it<00:04:28.260> which<00:04:28.440> puts<00:04:28.770> it

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
basically post-process it which puts it

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.790 
basically post-process it which puts it
in<00:04:29.010> the<00:04:29.130> code<00:04:29.340> necessary<00:04:29.660> for<00:04:30.660> the<00:04:30.780> program<00:04:31.650> to

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
in the code necessary for the program to

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.140 
in the code necessary for the program to
run<00:04:31.920> the<00:04:32.040> table

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.840 

next<00:04:38.020> I<00:04:38.290> basically<00:04:39.190> come<00:04:39.490> to<00:04:39.520> the

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850

burn tables control software turn on my

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.240 
burn tables control software turn on my
control<00:04:45.420> box<00:04:45.660> and<00:04:46.020> then<00:04:46.620> zero<00:04:46.920> out<00:04:47.100> the

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
control box and then zero out the

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.830 
control box and then zero out the
machine<00:04:47.640> on<00:04:47.970> the<00:04:48.060> bottom<00:04:48.300> left<00:04:48.510> corner<00:04:48.570> on

machine on the bottom left corner on
material<00:04:49.290> and<00:04:49.440> then<00:04:49.890> I<00:04:49.950> load<00:04:50.130> my<00:04:50.250> Chico

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.830 

here<00:04:59.890> it<00:05:00.220> shows<00:05:00.550> the<00:05:01.560> array<00:05:02.560> of<00:05:02.890> parts<00:05:03.760> and<00:05:04.660> all

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
here it shows the array of parts and all

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.770 
here it shows the array of parts and all
I<00:05:04.900> have<00:05:05.050> to<00:05:05.170> do<00:05:05.320> now<00:05:05.560> is<00:05:05.890> psycho<00:05:06.310> start<00:05:06.790> and<00:05:07.630> it

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
I have to do now is psycho start and it

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.190 
I have to do now is psycho start and it
goes<00:05:07.960> off<00:05:08.230> and<00:05:08.530> starts<00:05:09.130> cutting<00:05:09.550> the<00:05:10.200> parts

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200 
goes off and starts cutting the parts

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.420 
goes off and starts cutting the parts
out<00:05:11.350> so<00:05:11.650> it's<00:05:11.800> that<00:05:11.980> simple

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
out so it's that simple

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
out so it's that simple
so<00:05:13.210> in<00:05:13.630> less<00:05:13.840> than<00:05:14.050> five<00:05:14.860> minutes<00:05:15.120> I've<00:05:16.120> gotten

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
so in less than five minutes I've gotten

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:22.260 
so in less than five minutes I've gotten
