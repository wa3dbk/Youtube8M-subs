00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
so ballpark figure how much do you think

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.980 
so ballpark figure how much do you think
this<00:02:30.560> car<00:02:30.860> owes<00:02:31.130> you<00:02:31.570> hmm

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
so what makes it so fast well a

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.460 
so what makes it so fast well a

enormous<00:03:18.830> turbos<00:03:19.580> certainly<00:03:20.060> help<00:03:20.300> but<00:03:21.080> this

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
enormous turbos certainly help but this

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.840 
enormous turbos certainly help but this
isn't<00:03:21.410> just<00:03:21.650> lots<00:03:21.860> of<00:03:22.010> fast<00:03:22.310> bits<00:03:22.580> slung

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
isn't just lots of fast bits slung

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:23.350 
isn't just lots of fast bits slung
together

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360

it's 9.3 liters of perfectly tuned v8
just<00:03:26.870> a<00:03:26.960> millimeter<00:03:27.410> of<00:03:27.530> throttle<00:03:27.980> is<00:03:28.040> enough

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
just a millimeter of throttle is enough

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.920 
just a millimeter of throttle is enough
to<00:03:28.370> break<00:03:28.550> the<00:03:28.640> speed<00:03:28.970> limit<00:03:29.120> you<00:03:29.420> probably

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
to break the speed limit you probably

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.200 
to break the speed limit you probably
find<00:03:30.080> it's<00:03:30.320> not<00:03:30.470> that<00:03:30.620> easy<00:03:30.830> to<00:03:30.950> gain<00:03:31.220> yeah

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.210 
find it's not that easy to gain yeah
