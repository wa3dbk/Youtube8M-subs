they try to run forward to attack me and
once<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:11.909> spend<00:01:12.630> your<00:01:12.810> energy<00:01:13.170> with<00:01:13.350> the

once you spend your energy with the
Viper<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:14.010> consumed<00:01:14.640> ability<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.930> can

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
Viper is consumed ability and you can

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.410 
Viper is consumed ability and you can
use<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.799> drain<00:01:17.100> your<00:01:17.310> buildings<00:01:17.820> for<00:01:18.119> extra

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
use it to drain your buildings for extra

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.359 
use it to drain your buildings for extra
energy<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:19.020> does<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.200> lot<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.439> damage<00:01:19.740> those<00:01:20.100> so

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
energy it does a lot of damage those so

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.609 
energy it does a lot of damage those so
like<00:01:20.520> using<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:20.970> on<00:01:21.060> spine<00:01:21.390> crawler<00:01:21.689> probably

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
like using it on spine crawler probably

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.320 
like using it on spine crawler probably
not<00:01:22.710> a<00:01:22.740> good<00:01:22.890> idea<00:01:22.950> spine<00:01:23.610> crawlers<00:01:23.939> yourself

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
not a good idea spine crawlers yourself

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.830 
not a good idea spine crawlers yourself
that's<00:01:24.509> going<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.720> take<00:01:24.840> damage<00:01:26.509> it's<00:01:27.509> better

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
that's going to take damage it's better

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.380 
that's going to take damage it's better
to<00:01:28.140> use<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.740> on<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.430> as<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.670> new<00:01:29.820> cool<00:01:30.030> down<00:01:30.210> so

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
to use it on and as a new cool down so

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.609 
to use it on and as a new cool down so
you<00:01:30.479> can<00:01:30.600> switch<00:01:30.810> as<00:01:30.930> much<00:01:31.110> as<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.409> want

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
you can switch as much as you want

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.890 
you can switch as much as you want
setter<00:01:32.490> take<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.060> use<00:01:33.299> it<00:01:33.329> on<00:01:33.540> something

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
setter take it and use it on something

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.499 
setter take it and use it on something
like<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.909> extractor<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.150> obviously

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
like a extractor that you obviously

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.899 
like a extractor that you obviously
don't<00:01:36.659> need<00:01:36.780> anymore<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.950> neca<00:01:38.189> tree<00:01:38.490> mean

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
don't need anymore the neca tree mean

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.539 
don't need anymore the neca tree mean
it's<00:01:39.060> up<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.630> full<00:01:40.380> energy<00:01:40.799> over<00:01:41.310> time

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
it's up to you full energy over time

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.429 
it's up to you full energy over time
again<00:01:41.880> it's<00:01:42.060> not<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.450> fast<00:01:42.689> though<00:01:43.020> so<00:01:43.320> it

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
again it's not that fast though so it

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.170 
again it's not that fast though so it
does<00:01:43.590> take<00:01:43.619> well<00:01:44.100> it's<00:01:44.280> not<00:01:44.399> like<00:01:44.460> in<00:01:44.790> stinking

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
does take well it's not like in stinking

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.139 
does take well it's not like in stinking
seen<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:46.170> can<00:01:46.380> kill<00:01:46.590> your<00:01:46.740> buildings<00:01:47.149> it's

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
seen you can kill your buildings it's

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.580 
seen you can kill your buildings it's
better<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.479> leave<00:01:48.630> them<00:01:48.659> alive<00:01:48.960> with<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.259> couple

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
better to leave them alive with a couple

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.310 
better to leave them alive with a couple
health<00:01:49.790> so<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:51.210> can<00:01:51.509> let<00:01:52.170> them

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
health so that you can let them

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.870 
health so that you can let them
regenerate<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.040> train<00:01:53.369> from<00:01:53.520> them<00:01:53.670> another

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
regenerate and train from them another

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.179 
regenerate and train from them another
day<00:01:55.549> ok<00:01:56.549> so<00:01:56.610> you'll<00:01:56.909> see<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.180> energy<00:01:58.100> it's<00:01:59.100> a

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
day ok so you'll see of energy it's a

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.469 
day ok so you'll see of energy it's a
good<00:01:59.399> combination<00:01:59.700> to<00:02:00.180> use<00:02:00.390> let's<00:02:00.719> say<00:02:00.840> we're

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
good combination to use let's say we're

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.990 
good combination to use let's say we're
using<00:02:03.479> our<00:02:03.630> swarm<00:02:03.990> hosts<00:02:04.350> here<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:05.250> siege<00:02:05.579> like

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
using our swarm hosts here to siege like

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.880 
using our swarm hosts here to siege like
the<00:02:06.180> players<00:02:06.810> Maria

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.640 

so<00:02:12.890> what<00:02:13.129> they're<00:02:13.250> going<00:02:13.370> to<00:02:13.430> do<00:02:13.610> is<00:02:14.470> we<00:02:15.470> can

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
so what they're going to do is we can

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.650 
so what they're going to do is we can
rally<00:02:15.860> our<00:02:16.160> units<00:02:16.459> in<00:02:16.700> here<00:02:16.970> and<00:02:17.120> circling

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
rally our units in here and circling

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.830 
rally our units in here and circling
their<00:02:17.810> base<00:02:18.019> anytime<00:02:18.590> anything<00:02:19.069> comes<00:02:19.099> close

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
their base anytime anything comes close

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.570 
their base anytime anything comes close
we<00:02:20.840> can<00:02:20.989> back<00:02:21.260> our<00:02:21.500> swarm<00:02:21.830> hosts<00:02:22.160> up<00:02:22.310> with

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
we can back our swarm hosts up with

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.289 
we can back our swarm hosts up with
hydraulics<00:02:23.540> or<00:02:23.720> automated<00:02:24.560> defense<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.940> then

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
hydraulics or automated defense and then

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.420 
hydraulics or automated defense and then
when<00:02:26.390> something<00:02:26.720> comes<00:02:26.840> close<00:02:27.200> we<00:02:27.440> just<00:02:27.680> snag

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
when something comes close we just snag

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.970 
when something comes close we just snag
it<00:02:28.640> and<00:02:29.330> with<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:29.690> up<00:02:29.780> dog<00:02:32.349> and<00:02:33.349> if<00:02:33.470> you<00:02:33.620> are<00:02:33.680> a

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
it and with the up dog and if you are a

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.440 
it and with the up dog and if you are a
really<00:02:34.340> good<00:02:34.430> micro<00:02:34.790> you<00:02:34.910> can<00:02:35.030> actually<00:02:35.180> use<00:02:35.360> a

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
really good micro you can actually use a

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:43.720 
really good micro you can actually use a
good<00:02:35.720> chain<00:02:36.019> abduct<00:02:36.500> where<00:02:36.769> your<00:02:36.950> own<00:02:42.730> or

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
good chain abduct where your own or

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.350 
good chain abduct where your own or
you're<00:02:43.880> actually<00:02:43.970> pulling<00:02:44.390> things<00:02:44.690> twice<00:02:46.360> so

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
you're actually pulling things twice so

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.640 
you're actually pulling things twice so
you<00:02:47.420> can<00:02:47.540> see<00:02:47.750> I'm<00:02:47.840> able<00:02:48.079> to<00:02:48.140> do<00:02:48.349> some<00:02:48.530> good

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
you can see I'm able to do some good

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.220 
you can see I'm able to do some good
damage<00:02:49.040> there<00:02:49.630> so<00:02:50.630> rather<00:02:50.810> than<00:02:50.930> what<00:02:51.110> the

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
damage there so rather than what the

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.380 
damage there so rather than what the
swarm<00:02:51.500> whose<00:02:51.680> take<00:02:51.950> damage<00:02:52.190> from<00:02:52.370> enemy<00:02:52.849> units

know a couple things I meant to have it

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.550 
know a couple things I meant to have it
mentioned<00:04:17.390> yet<00:04:17.510> or<00:04:17.690> that<00:04:17.810> the<00:04:17.900> Viper<00:04:18.109> requires

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
mentioned yet or that the Viper requires

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.600 
mentioned yet or that the Viper requires
high<00:04:18.830> technology<00:04:19.549> but<00:04:20.060> no<00:04:20.859> spire<00:04:21.859> it's<00:04:22.340> flying

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
high technology but no spire it's flying

you<00:04:22.880> but<00:04:23.180> it<00:04:23.270> doesn't<00:04:23.540> require<00:04:23.750> anything<00:04:24.140> but

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
you but it doesn't require anything but

a hive it basically lets and just some
more<00:04:29.270> talk<00:04:29.570> about<00:04:29.840> like<00:04:29.960> the<00:04:30.110> adult<00:04:30.350> ability

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
more talk about like the adult ability

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.350 
more talk about like the adult ability
this<00:04:32.450> basically<00:04:33.220> let's<00:04:34.220> the<00:04:34.400> Protoss<00:04:35.120> player

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
this basically let's the Protoss player

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.010 
this basically let's the Protoss player
grab<00:04:35.630> Colossus<00:04:36.290> from<00:04:36.470> afar<00:04:36.710> range<00:04:37.040> and<00:04:38.020> that

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
grab Colossus from afar range and that

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.340 
grab Colossus from afar range and that
pretty<00:04:39.350> much<00:04:39.580> makes<00:04:40.580> gives<00:04:41.240> the<00:04:41.510> Zerg<00:04:41.780> another

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
pretty much makes gives the Zerg another

pretty much makes gives the Zerg another
anti<00:04:42.800> Colossus<00:04:43.430> mean<00:04:43.700> it<00:04:43.960> that<00:04:44.960> isn't<00:04:45.530> a

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
anti Colossus mean it that isn't a

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.400 
anti Colossus mean it that isn't a
Corrupter<00:04:46.160> so<00:04:46.790> if<00:04:47.150> you're<00:04:47.360> doing<00:04:47.630> Roche<00:04:47.840> Hydra

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
Corrupter so if you're doing Roche Hydra

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.680 
Corrupter so if you're doing Roche Hydra
you<00:04:49.070> know<00:04:49.160> pretty<00:04:49.340> standard<00:04:49.820> build<00:04:50.090> you<00:04:50.510> can

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
you know pretty standard build you can

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.660 
you know pretty standard build you can
use<00:04:50.900> abduct<00:04:51.410> to<00:04:51.560> kill<00:04:51.770> corruptors<00:04:52.250> once<00:04:52.520> they

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:52.670 
use abduct to kill corruptors once they

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.320 
use abduct to kill corruptors once they
come<00:04:52.820> out<00:04:53.000> into<00:04:53.150> the<00:04:53.270> map<00:04:53.560> whereas<00:04:54.560> previously

come out into the map whereas previously

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.850 
come out into the map whereas previously
you<00:04:56.330> had<00:04:56.360> to<00:04:56.690> get<00:04:56.780> croppers<00:04:57.200> out<00:04:57.380> if<00:04:57.560> you<00:04:57.650> sell

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
you had to get croppers out if you sell

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.590 
you had to get croppers out if you sell
colossi<00:04:58.400> which<00:04:58.850> meant<00:04:59.060> you<00:04:59.090> had<00:04:59.300> to<00:04:59.360> get<00:04:59.570> a

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
colossi which meant you had to get a

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.390 
colossi which meant you had to get a
spire<00:04:59.930> Yediot<00:05:00.320> of<00:05:00.410> separate<00:05:00.770> set<00:05:00.920> of<00:05:00.950> upgrades

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.830 
spire Yediot of separate set of upgrades
now<00:05:02.120> the<00:05:02.210> desert<00:05:02.480> could<00:05:02.630> be<00:05:02.690> way<00:05:02.810> more

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
now the desert could be way more

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.990 
now the desert could be way more
efficient<00:05:03.470> just<00:05:03.740> use<00:05:03.890> abduct<00:05:04.280> to<00:05:04.550> kill<00:05:04.730> Klaus

a<00:05:18.020> very<00:05:18.169> useful<00:05:18.470> unit

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
a very useful unit

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.309 
a very useful unit
in<00:05:19.580> the<00:05:19.699> binding<00:05:20.120> cloud<00:05:20.330> in<00:05:20.539> particular<00:05:21.080> is

00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:21.319 
in the binding cloud in particular is

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:24.730 
in the binding cloud in particular is
incredibly<00:05:22.310> strong<00:05:22.639> versus<00:05:23.060> siege<00:05:23.270> tanks<00:05:23.740> it

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
incredibly strong versus siege tanks it

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.820 
incredibly strong versus siege tanks it
basically<00:05:24.949> makes<00:05:25.610> a<00:05:26.349> cloud<00:05:27.349> on<00:05:27.379> the<00:05:27.590> ground

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
basically makes a cloud on the ground

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.820 
basically makes a cloud on the ground
and<00:05:28.250> I<00:05:28.729> showed<00:05:29.180> it<00:05:29.300> briefly<00:05:29.419> earlier<00:05:29.870> that<00:05:30.800> a

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
and I showed it briefly earlier that a

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:33.369 
and I showed it briefly earlier that a
unit<00:05:31.250> inside<00:05:31.669> only<00:05:31.970> has<00:05:32.360> a<00:05:32.389> melee<00:05:32.810> attack<00:05:33.139> now

00:05:33.369 --> 00:05:33.379 
unit inside only has a melee attack now

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:35.110 
unit inside only has a melee attack now
like<00:05:33.650> range<00:05:33.889> the<00:05:34.099> range<00:05:34.280> grounding<00:05:34.970> it's

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
like range the range grounding it's

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.839 
like range the range grounding it's
going<00:05:35.330> to<00:05:35.389> attack<00:05:35.860> once<00:05:36.860> the<00:05:37.220> binding<00:05:37.550> loudest

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:37.849 
going to attack once the binding loudest

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:41.890 
going to attack once the binding loudest
on<00:05:38.090> and<00:05:38.330> same<00:05:38.629> thing<00:05:38.659> goes<00:05:39.020> for<00:05:39.050> a<00:05:40.900> spine

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
on and same thing goes for a spine

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:43.960 
on and same thing goes for a spine
crawler<00:05:42.139> see<00:05:42.560> it<00:05:42.770> makes<00:05:43.039> them<00:05:43.220> melee<00:05:43.550> handling

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:43.970 
crawler see it makes them melee handling

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.300 
crawler see it makes them melee handling
so<00:05:44.720> it's<00:05:44.870> good<00:05:45.050> to<00:05:45.080> use<00:05:45.259> an<00:05:45.379> automated<00:05:45.560> defense

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310 
so it's good to use an automated defense

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.659 
so it's good to use an automated defense
so<00:05:46.610> that<00:05:46.849> you<00:05:47.060> can<00:05:48.069> attack<00:05:49.069> where<00:05:49.340> you<00:05:49.430> can't

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:49.669 
so that you can attack where you can't

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:56.050 
so that you can attack where you can't
be<00:05:49.789> hit<00:05:49.940> back<00:05:53.710> so<00:05:54.710> I<00:05:55.039> mean<00:05:55.460> obviously<00:05:55.819> that'll

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
be hit back so I mean obviously that'll

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.550 
be hit back so I mean obviously that'll
be<00:05:56.180> one<00:05:56.360> of<00:05:56.449> the<00:05:56.509> enemy's<00:05:56.900> defense<00:05:57.289> or<00:05:57.470> not

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 
be one of the enemy's defense or not

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.839 
be one of the enemy's defense or not
you're<00:05:57.740> in<00:05:58.990> but<00:05:59.990> it<00:06:00.740> says<00:06:00.979> trying<00:06:01.550> to<00:06:01.639> say

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:01.849 
you're in but it says trying to say

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:03.399 
you're in but it says trying to say
Eddie<00:06:02.060> the<00:06:02.210> binding<00:06:02.539> cloud<00:06:02.750> since<00:06:03.139> it<00:06:03.259> takes

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:03.409 
Eddie the binding cloud since it takes

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:05.740 
Eddie the binding cloud since it takes
away<00:06:03.650> the<00:06:03.770> melee<00:06:04.039> attack<00:06:04.340> and<00:06:04.699> it<00:06:04.970> it<00:06:05.210> lasts<00:06:05.720> in

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:05.750 
away the melee attack and it it lasts in

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.330 
away the melee attack and it it lasts in
a<00:06:05.840> small<00:06:06.169> swap<00:06:06.409> may<00:06:06.620> be<00:06:06.680> seen<00:06:06.919> its<00:06:07.069> are<00:06:07.190> just

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:07.340 
a small swap may be seen its are just

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.670 
a small swap may be seen its are just
going<00:06:07.460> to<00:06:07.490> move<00:06:07.639> out<00:06:07.849> of<00:06:08.000> it<00:06:08.120> but<00:06:08.680> it's

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 
going to move out of it but it's

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.670 
going to move out of it but it's
particularly<00:06:10.310> good<00:06:10.550> when<00:06:11.150> using<00:06:11.840> OC<00:06:12.139> chang<00:06:12.440> s

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:12.680 
particularly good when using OC chang s

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.189 
particularly good when using OC chang s
each<00:06:12.830> thing<00:06:13.069> at<00:06:13.190> siege<00:06:13.370> mode<00:06:13.550> can't<00:06:13.849> move<00:06:14.199> so

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:15.199 
each thing at siege mode can't move so

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:17.279 
each thing at siege mode can't move so
obviously<00:06:15.770> that's<00:06:15.919> gonna<00:06:16.130> be<00:06:16.280> limitation<00:06:16.909> all

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:17.289 
obviously that's gonna be limitation all

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:22.240 
obviously that's gonna be limitation all
additionally<00:06:19.360> it<00:06:20.360> has<00:06:20.389> the<00:06:21.110> Amelia<00:06:21.440> tag<00:06:21.710> so<00:06:22.069> if

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.250 
additionally it has the Amelia tag so if

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.279 
additionally it has the Amelia tag so if
you<00:06:22.370> use<00:06:23.000> a<00:06:23.030> binding<00:06:23.419> cloud<00:06:23.599> on<00:06:23.780> a<00:06:23.840> siege<00:06:24.050> tank

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:24.289 
you use a binding cloud on a siege tank
