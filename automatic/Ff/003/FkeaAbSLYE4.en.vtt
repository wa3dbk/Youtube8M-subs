00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
review with Tom vassal when I first

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.099 
review with Tom vassal when I first
heard<00:00:14.280> about<00:00:14.400> Carcassonne<00:00:15.150> will<00:00:15.420> fortune<00:00:15.960> I

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
heard about Carcassonne will fortune I

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.640 
heard about Carcassonne will fortune I
assumed<00:00:16.619> that<00:00:16.890> it<00:00:17.070> was<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.400> newest<00:00:18.090> expansion

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
assumed that it was the newest expansion

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.099 
assumed that it was the newest expansion
for<00:00:19.650> Carcassonne<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.550> original<00:00:20.939> game<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.869> I

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
for Carcassonne the original game and I

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.599 
for Carcassonne the original game and I
thought<00:00:22.289> all<00:00:22.500> right<00:00:22.650> great<00:00:22.949> you<00:00:22.980> know<00:00:23.220> yet

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
thought all right great you know yet

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.939 
thought all right great you know yet
another<00:00:24.119> Carcassonne<00:00:24.779> expansion<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:25.859> have

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
another Carcassonne expansion and I have

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:26.779 
another Carcassonne expansion and I have
no<00:00:26.070> problem<00:00:26.430> with<00:00:26.490> that

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
no problem with that

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.460 
no problem with that
but<00:00:27.119> I<00:00:27.330> was<00:00:27.539> really<00:00:27.779> surprised<00:00:28.230> when<00:00:28.349> I<00:00:28.439> got

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
but I was really surprised when I got

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.189 
but I was really surprised when I got
the<00:00:28.800> game<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.449> realized<00:00:30.449> that<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.810> was<00:00:30.990> its

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
the game and realized that it was its

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.310 
the game and realized that it was its
own<00:00:31.320> game<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:32.550> itself<00:00:33.329> basically

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
own game and of it of itself basically

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.740 
own game and of it of itself basically
it's<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.070> exact<00:00:35.610> same<00:00:35.880> as<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.510> original

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
it's the exact same as the original

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.950 
it's the exact same as the original
Carcassonne<00:00:37.620> game<00:00:37.860> along<00:00:38.820> with<00:00:39.149> well<00:00:39.660> the

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
Carcassonne game along with well the

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.900 
Carcassonne game along with well the
Wheel<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.140> Fortune<00:00:40.410> which<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.579> point<00:00:41.820> of

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
Wheel of Fortune which is the point of

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.810 
Wheel of Fortune which is the point of
this<00:00:42.000> add<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:43.649> even<00:00:43.980> though<00:00:44.340> I<00:00:44.370> can't

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
this add it to it so even though I can't

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.279 
this add it to it so even though I can't
find<00:00:45.000> anywhere<00:00:45.390> in<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.629> rules<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:46.110> say

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
find anywhere in the rules that say

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.319 
find anywhere in the rules that say
anything<00:00:46.410> about<00:00:46.710> combining<00:00:47.370> them<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:47.640> suppose

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
anything about combining them I suppose

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.479 
anything about combining them I suppose
it<00:00:48.539> could<00:00:48.780> be<00:00:48.809> an<00:00:49.050> expansion<00:00:49.500> but<00:00:50.070> it's<00:00:50.190> also<00:00:50.340> a

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
it could be an expansion but it's also a

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.819 
it could be an expansion but it's also a
standalone<00:00:51.000> game<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:51.930> for<00:00:52.170> someone<00:00:52.379> like<00:00:52.500> me

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
standalone game so for someone like me

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.520 
standalone game so for someone like me
who<00:00:53.730> has<00:00:54.210> all<00:00:54.570> their<00:00:55.020> expansions<00:00:55.500> for

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
who has all their expansions for

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.229 
who has all their expansions for
Carcassonne<00:00:56.070> in<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.430> box<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:56.879> another<00:00:57.120> box

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.139 
Carcassonne in this box and another box
everything<00:00:58.020> in<00:00:58.170> one<00:00:58.520> adding<00:00:59.520> in<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.820> wheel<00:01:00.000> of

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
is useful for me because I can use this

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.160 
is useful for me because I can use this

interesting ideas some interesting

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.429 
interesting ideas some interesting
mechanics<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.670> mulch<00:01:18.570> or<00:01:18.840> something<00:01:19.110> new<00:01:19.229> in

mechanics and mulch or something new in

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.859 
mechanics and mulch or something new in
it<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.710> as<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:19.979> great<00:01:20.400> starting<00:01:20.970> tile<00:01:21.210> but<00:01:21.780> if

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
it and as a great starting tile but if

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.210 
it and as a great starting tile but if
you've<00:01:21.990> not<00:01:22.140> played<00:01:22.350> Kurt<00:01:22.680> some<00:01:22.890> before<00:01:23.159> this

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
you've not played Kurt some before this

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.950 
you've not played Kurt some before this
is<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.340> good<00:01:23.490> way<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.640> jump<00:01:23.970> in<00:01:24.150> if<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.720> have

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
is a good way to jump in if you have

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.050 
is a good way to jump in if you have
well<00:01:25.560> here<00:01:25.680> soon<00:01:25.860> there's<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.400> pile<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.909> new

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
well here soon there's a pile of new

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.300 
well here soon there's a pile of new
tiles<00:01:27.509> involved<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.170> this<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:28.650> makes<00:01:29.189> a

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
tiles involved in this and it makes a

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.219 
tiles involved in this and it makes a
decent<00:01:29.460> expansion<00:01:30.030> for<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.689> original<00:01:31.020> game

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
decent expansion for the original game

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.140 
decent expansion for the original game
alright<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.220> just<00:01:32.250> looked<00:01:32.549> at<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.759> back<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:32.970> the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
alright I just looked at the back of the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.789 
alright I just looked at the back of the
box<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.630> back<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:33.990> box<00:01:34.170> says<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.590> could<00:01:34.710> be

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
box the back of the box says it could be

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.830 
box the back of the box says it could be
combined<00:01:35.189> with<00:01:35.460> regular<00:01:36.000> Carcassonne<00:01:36.689> and

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
combined with regular Carcassonne and

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.230 
combined with regular Carcassonne and
that<00:01:36.930> makes<00:01:37.140> sense<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.560> rules<00:01:37.770> themselves

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
that makes sense the rules themselves

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.899 
that makes sense the rules themselves
they<00:01:39.240> act<00:01:39.619> they<00:01:40.619> they<00:01:40.979> treat<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.460> basically

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
they act they they treat you basically

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.249 
they act they they treat you basically
as<00:01:42.060> if<00:01:42.180> you've<00:01:42.270> never<00:01:42.420> played<00:01:42.630> before<00:01:42.840> but<00:01:43.049> if

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
as if you've never played before but if

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.469 
as if you've never played before but if
you<00:01:43.350> have<00:01:43.560> played<00:01:43.860> before<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.939> simply<00:01:45.329> have

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
you have played before you simply have

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.929 
you have played before you simply have
to<00:01:45.509> just<00:01:45.659> read<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.200> stuff<00:01:46.409> in<00:01:46.530> red<00:01:46.770> which<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:47.850> a

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
to just read the stuff in red which is a

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.819 
to just read the stuff in red which is a
whole<00:01:48.240> lot<00:01:48.329> shorter<00:01:48.600> except<00:01:49.049> for<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.259> while<00:01:49.439> as

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
whole lot shorter except for a while as

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
section where there already is someone

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.119 
section where there already is someone
let's<00:02:43.140> say<00:02:43.200> there<00:02:43.319> was<00:02:43.379> a<00:02:43.440> blue<00:02:43.650> guy<00:02:43.829> in<00:02:44.010> that

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
let's say there was a blue guy in that

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:46.280 
let's say there was a blue guy in that
city<00:02:44.370> already<00:02:44.730> I<00:02:45.000> would<00:02:45.569> not<00:02:45.810> be<00:02:45.959> able<00:02:46.019> to<00:02:46.140> put

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
city already I would not be able to put

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.680 
city already I would not be able to put
a<00:02:46.319> red<00:02:46.590> person<00:02:46.859> in<00:02:47.160> that<00:02:47.340> city<00:02:47.579> the<00:02:48.329> only<00:02:48.540> way<00:02:48.629> I

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
a red person in that city the only way I

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.940 
a red person in that city the only way I
could<00:02:48.810> do<00:02:48.930> that<00:02:49.109> is<00:02:49.290> by<00:02:49.640> at<00:02:50.640> some<00:02:51.090> point

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
could do that is by at some point

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.630 
could do that is by at some point
building<00:02:52.950> tiles<00:02:53.370> so<00:02:54.090> that<00:02:55.549> building<00:02:56.549> is

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
building tiles so that building is

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.550 
building tiles so that building is
putting<00:02:57.060> a<00:02:57.120> red<00:02:57.329> guy<00:02:57.480> in<00:02:57.569> the<00:02:57.659> city<00:02:57.870> over<00:02:58.079> here

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
putting a red guy in the city over here

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.199 
putting a red guy in the city over here
and<00:02:58.739> then<00:02:59.220> hoping<00:02:59.579> somehow<00:02:59.849> that<00:03:00.000> those

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
and then hoping somehow that those

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.369 
and then hoping somehow that those
cities<00:03:00.480> get<00:03:00.690> connected<00:03:01.109> together<00:03:02.180> now<00:03:03.180> as<00:03:03.450> the

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 
cities get connected together now as the

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:05.690 
cities get connected together now as the
game<00:03:04.530> progresses<00:03:04.920> you'll<00:03:05.250> be<00:03:05.370> building<00:03:05.640> the

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
game progresses you'll be building the

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.580 
game progresses you'll be building the
city's<00:03:05.970> bigger<00:03:06.180> and<00:03:06.420> bigger<00:03:06.569> when<00:03:07.230> a<00:03:07.290> city<00:03:07.530> is

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
city's bigger and bigger when a city is

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.789 
city's bigger and bigger when a city is
finished<00:03:08.120> you<00:03:09.120> get<00:03:09.269> two<00:03:09.540> points<00:03:09.959> for<00:03:10.440> every

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
finished you get two points for every

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.770 
finished you get two points for every
section<00:03:11.430> of<00:03:11.730> that<00:03:11.940> city<00:03:12.150> so<00:03:12.299> let's<00:03:12.450> say<00:03:12.569> for

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
section of that city so let's say for

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.839 
section of that city so let's say for
example<00:03:13.010> this<00:03:14.010> city<00:03:14.250> here<00:03:14.549> is<00:03:15.260> finished<00:03:16.849> isn't

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
example this city here is finished isn't

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:19.789 
example this city here is finished isn't
that<00:03:18.060> a<00:03:18.090> cool<00:03:18.329> city<00:03:18.569> that's<00:03:19.200> it<00:03:19.349> he<00:03:19.410> takes<00:03:19.530> 4

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
that a cool city that's it he takes 4

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.159 
that a cool city that's it he takes 4
tiles<00:03:20.160> 1<00:03:20.340> 2<00:03:20.459> 3<00:03:20.639> 4<00:03:20.880> tiles<00:03:21.090> so<00:03:21.299> that's<00:03:21.419> worth<00:03:21.599> 4

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:22.169 
tiles 1 2 3 4 tiles so that's worth 4

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:23.629 
tiles 1 2 3 4 tiles so that's worth 4
times<00:03:22.380> 2<00:03:22.560> is<00:03:22.590> 8<00:03:22.829> plus<00:03:22.889> there's<00:03:23.370> a<00:03:23.400> little

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
times 2 is 8 plus there's a little

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:25.610 
times 2 is 8 plus there's a little
shield<00:03:23.849> symbol<00:03:24.299> in<00:03:24.389> it<00:03:24.480> so<00:03:25.019> that's<00:03:25.169> 10<00:03:25.410> points

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
shield symbol in it so that's 10 points

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.289 
shield symbol in it so that's 10 points
that<00:03:26.069> the<00:03:26.220> blue<00:03:26.400> person<00:03:26.579> would<00:03:26.819> score<00:03:27.060> for<00:03:27.239> the

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
that the blue person would score for the

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.089 
that the blue person would score for the
city<00:03:27.510> and<00:03:27.720> then<00:03:28.230> they<00:03:28.379> would<00:03:28.530> get<00:03:28.650> their<00:03:28.889> blue

just<00:06:34.540> use<00:06:34.660> this<00:06:34.780> as<00:06:34.930> a<00:06:34.990> good<00:06:35.140> starting<00:06:35.530> tile<00:06:35.710> if

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:35.980 
just use this as a good starting tile if

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.239 
just use this as a good starting tile if
you<00:06:36.790> already<00:06:37.120> like<00:06:37.419> Carcassonne<00:06:38.020> you

00:06:38.239 --> 00:06:38.249 
you already like Carcassonne you

00:06:38.249 --> 00:06:40.699 
you already like Carcassonne you
you<00:06:38.399> for<00:06:38.549> an<00:06:38.639> expansion<00:06:38.969> this<00:06:39.629> is<00:06:39.959> definitely

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:40.709 
you for an expansion this is definitely

00:06:40.709 --> 00:06:43.579 
you for an expansion this is definitely
not<00:06:41.069> one<00:06:41.339> of<00:06:41.369> the<00:06:41.519> stronger<00:06:41.969> expansions<00:06:42.959> yes

00:06:43.579 --> 00:06:43.589 
not one of the stronger expansions yes

00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:45.079 
not one of the stronger expansions yes
it<00:06:43.829> adds<00:06:44.009> a<00:06:44.129> whole<00:06:44.249> lot<00:06:44.399> of<00:06:44.519> neat<00:06:44.639> tiles<00:06:44.879> and

00:06:45.079 --> 00:06:45.089 
it adds a whole lot of neat tiles and

00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:46.609 
it adds a whole lot of neat tiles and
even<00:06:45.329> has<00:06:45.449> some<00:06:45.599> tiles<00:06:45.989> that<00:06:46.169> weren't<00:06:46.499> in<00:06:46.589> the

00:06:46.609 --> 00:06:46.619 
even has some tiles that weren't in the

00:06:46.619 --> 00:06:48.949 
even has some tiles that weren't in the
original<00:06:46.709> game<00:06:47.339> and<00:06:47.579> it's<00:06:48.149> but<00:06:48.569> still<00:06:48.779> I<00:06:48.809> mean

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:48.959 
original game and it's but still I mean

00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:50.269 
original game and it's but still I mean
it's<00:06:49.079> neat<00:06:49.199> to<00:06:49.229> have<00:06:49.349> two<00:06:49.619> of<00:06:49.829> some<00:06:50.129> of<00:06:50.219> the

00:06:50.269 --> 00:06:50.279 
it's neat to have two of some of the

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:52.579 
it's neat to have two of some of the
tiles<00:06:50.689> but<00:06:51.689> the<00:06:51.809> Wheel<00:06:51.929> of<00:06:51.959> Fortune<00:06:52.139> itself

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:52.589 
tiles but the Wheel of Fortune itself

00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:55.219 
tiles but the Wheel of Fortune itself
while<00:06:52.859> interesting<00:06:53.339> doesn't<00:06:54.179> really<00:06:54.539> add<00:06:54.779> a

00:06:55.219 --> 00:06:55.229 
while interesting doesn't really add a

any kind of pulse to the game it's more

Fortune but if you're already playing
with<00:07:05.549> all<00:07:05.759> the<00:07:05.879> expansions<00:07:06.329> well<00:07:06.479> then<00:07:06.599> you

00:07:06.709 --> 00:07:06.719 
with all the expansions well then you

00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:08.359 
with all the expansions well then you
you're<00:07:07.019> not<00:07:07.229> only<00:07:07.409> you're<00:07:07.799> watching<00:07:08.279> this

you're not only you're watching this

00:07:08.369 --> 00:07:09.979 
you're not only you're watching this
review<00:07:08.549> just<00:07:08.909> to<00:07:08.999> justify<00:07:09.449> the<00:07:09.509> fact<00:07:09.719> that<00:07:09.899> you

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:09.989 
review just to justify the fact that you

00:07:09.989 --> 00:07:13.279 
review just to justify the fact that you
already<00:07:10.109> have<00:07:10.379> ordered<00:07:11.309> this<00:07:11.659> but<00:07:12.659> I<00:07:12.899> just

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:13.289 
already have ordered this but I just

00:07:13.289 --> 00:07:14.359 
already have ordered this but I just
found<00:07:13.379> it<00:07:13.529> interesting<00:07:13.769> that<00:07:13.949> this<00:07:14.099> one<00:07:14.279> was

00:07:14.359 --> 00:07:14.369 
found it interesting that this one was

00:07:14.369 --> 00:07:16.459 
found it interesting that this one was
released<00:07:14.759> as<00:07:14.969> its<00:07:15.329> own<00:07:15.569> game<00:07:15.929> and<00:07:16.199> I<00:07:16.229> think

00:07:16.459 --> 00:07:16.469 
released as its own game and I think

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:18.499 
released as its own game and I think
that<00:07:16.619> the<00:07:16.739> nice<00:07:16.979> idea<00:07:17.339> this<00:07:17.909> does<00:07:18.149> not<00:07:18.269> add

00:07:18.499 --> 00:07:18.509 
that the nice idea this does not add

00:07:18.509 --> 00:07:20.689 
that the nice idea this does not add
complexity<00:07:19.049> I've<00:07:19.589> taught<00:07:19.889> many<00:07:20.099> new<00:07:20.399> players

00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:20.699 
complexity I've taught many new players

00:07:20.699 --> 00:07:23.239 
complexity I've taught many new players
with<00:07:21.089> the<00:07:21.299> wheel<00:07:21.449> fortune<00:07:21.959> and<00:07:22.110> just<00:07:22.769> starting

00:07:23.239 --> 00:07:23.249 
with the wheel fortune and just starting

00:07:23.249 --> 00:07:24.709 
with the wheel fortune and just starting
out<00:07:23.369> with<00:07:23.399> that<00:07:23.549> and<00:07:23.819> they<00:07:23.879> had<00:07:24.059> no<00:07:24.209> problem<00:07:24.629> at

00:07:24.709 --> 00:07:24.719 
out with that and they had no problem at

00:07:24.719 --> 00:07:26.899 
out with that and they had no problem at
all<00:07:24.809> getting<00:07:25.199> into<00:07:25.469> that<00:07:25.619> well<00:07:26.159> though<00:07:26.459> some

00:07:26.899 --> 00:07:26.909 
all getting into that well though some

00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:28.129 
all getting into that well though some
people<00:07:27.179> do<00:07:27.299> get<00:07:27.509> caught<00:07:27.749> up<00:07:27.899> putting

00:07:28.129 --> 00:07:28.139 
people do get caught up putting

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:30.319 
people do get caught up putting
meatballs<00:07:28.619> on<00:07:28.829> to<00:07:29.189> the<00:07:29.309> wheel<00:07:29.399> fortune<00:07:29.909> but

00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:30.329 
meatballs on to the wheel fortune but

00:07:30.329 --> 00:07:31.309 
meatballs on to the wheel fortune but
near<00:07:30.449> the<00:07:30.539> end<00:07:30.659> of<00:07:30.689> the<00:07:30.779> game<00:07:30.899> it's<00:07:31.019> kind<00:07:31.169> of<00:07:31.199> a

00:07:31.309 --> 00:07:31.319 
near the end of the game it's kind of a

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:32.659 
near the end of the game it's kind of a
waste<00:07:31.469> because<00:07:31.829> there's<00:07:32.009> only<00:07:32.069> so<00:07:32.189> many<00:07:32.369> tiles

00:07:32.659 --> 00:07:32.669 
waste because there's only so many tiles

00:07:32.669 --> 00:07:34.519 
waste because there's only so many tiles
left<00:07:33.029> the<00:07:33.419> pig<00:07:33.629> may<00:07:33.779> not<00:07:33.959> land<00:07:34.229> and<00:07:34.439> then

00:07:34.519 --> 00:07:34.529 
left the pig may not land and then

00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:36.019 
left the pig may not land and then
you've<00:07:34.679> wasted<00:07:34.979> all<00:07:35.279> the<00:07:35.429> people<00:07:35.699> you<00:07:35.849> put

00:07:36.019 --> 00:07:36.029 
you've wasted all the people you put

00:07:36.029 --> 00:07:37.909 
you've wasted all the people you put
here<00:07:36.329> so<00:07:36.869> don't<00:07:37.049> get<00:07:37.139> too<00:07:37.319> caught<00:07:37.529> up<00:07:37.589> on

00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:37.919 
here so don't get too caught up on

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:40.159 
here so don't get too caught up on
putting<00:07:38.459> points<00:07:38.759> here<00:07:39.029> but<00:07:39.509> you<00:07:39.629> can't<00:07:39.839> ignore

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:40.169 
putting points here but you can't ignore

00:07:40.169 --> 00:07:40.339 
putting points here but you can't ignore
it

00:07:40.339 --> 00:07:40.349 
it

00:07:40.349 --> 00:07:42.289 
it
either<00:07:40.559> because<00:07:40.859> it's<00:07:41.129> a<00:07:41.189> useful<00:07:41.579> way<00:07:41.729> to<00:07:42.179> get

00:07:42.289 --> 00:07:42.299 
either because it's a useful way to get

00:07:42.299 --> 00:07:43.729 
either because it's a useful way to get
more<00:07:42.509> points<00:07:42.719> if<00:07:42.989> you<00:07:43.079> have<00:07:43.199> nothing<00:07:43.349> else<00:07:43.589> to

00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:43.739 
more points if you have nothing else to

00:07:43.739 --> 00:07:46.549 
more points if you have nothing else to
do<00:07:43.949> a<00:07:44.159> good<00:07:45.019> variant<00:07:46.019> of<00:07:46.259> the<00:07:46.469> original

00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:46.559 
do a good variant of the original

00:07:46.559 --> 00:07:48.619 
do a good variant of the original
Carcassonne<00:07:47.249> nothing<00:07:47.879> earth-shaking<00:07:48.299> this

00:07:48.619 --> 00:07:48.629 
Carcassonne nothing earth-shaking this

00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:51.529 
Carcassonne nothing earth-shaking this
is<00:07:48.749> probably<00:07:49.110> the<00:07:49.319> easiest<00:07:49.979> going<00:07:50.939> variant

00:07:51.529 --> 00:07:51.539 
is probably the easiest going variant

00:07:51.539 --> 00:07:54.259 
is probably the easiest going variant
that<00:07:51.689> the<00:07:52.039> designer<00:07:53.039> has<00:07:53.159> produced<00:07:53.729> yet<00:07:53.999> but

00:07:54.259 --> 00:07:54.269 
that the designer has produced yet but

00:07:54.269 --> 00:07:55.850 
that the designer has produced yet but
it's<00:07:54.389> a<00:07:54.479> good<00:07:54.659> jumping<00:07:55.049> on<00:07:55.199> point<00:07:55.439> if<00:07:55.679> you're

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:55.860 
it's a good jumping on point if you're

00:07:55.860 --> 00:08:00.559 
it's a good jumping on point if you're
