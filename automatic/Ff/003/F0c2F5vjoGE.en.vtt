math<00:01:09.780> not<00:01:10.080> really<00:01:10.320> well<00:01:10.530> see<00:01:10.770> somewhere<00:01:11.310> in

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
math not really well see somewhere in

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
math not really well see somewhere in
between<00:01:12.170> and<00:01:13.170> then<00:01:13.350> we<00:01:13.740> have<00:01:13.890> two<00:01:14.100> disks<00:01:14.610> let's
