00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
work them out towards the wheel hub and

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.539 
work them out towards the wheel hub and
then<00:01:24.180> that'll<00:01:25.170> be<00:01:25.200> able<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.560> be<00:01:26.189> able<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.400> get

you've got the brake rotor hub and then
your<00:01:55.590> splines<00:01:56.009> all<00:01:56.250> freed<00:01:56.579> up<00:01:57.439> you've<00:01:58.439> got

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
your splines all freed up you've got

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.270 
your splines all freed up you've got
four<00:01:59.610> Allen's<00:02:00.060> here<00:02:00.530> that<00:02:01.530> clamp<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:04.280> bearing

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
four Allen's here that clamp the bearing
