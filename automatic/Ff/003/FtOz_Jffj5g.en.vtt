00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.900
 next here we have a kitchen 

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:09.940
 of pvc 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:15.139
 chocolate color with bar hips 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:19.760
 area of ​​species and in this case then 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:23.170
 we have a cover the apparent 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:26.199
 granite in this case this kitchen 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.759
 apparent to granite salt what is the 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:32.720
 cover is extremely thick and gives 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:37.100
 a pretty elegant appearance to the 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:39.500
 cook this part then this is it 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.120
 apparent with the definitely the 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:46.460
 granite is very very decorative and therefore 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.550
 Because there are high dinners at 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:52.280
 roof and in this case has the molding 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.100
 tablet type what is the frame the 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.770
 board type doors proceed to open 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.260
 the doors and well as you see 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.620
 It has two shelves area the heras to the 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.979
 roof a decorative vegetable 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.619
 if we see here also in the part 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:12.770
 superior is in this one that is 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:16.310
 directly to the something that are the 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.229
 walls to what are the walls so very 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.140
 well very well distributed this kind of 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.659
 kitchen 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.300
 in this case then I will proceed too 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:28.540
 open the special the grocer then 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:31.330
 has a column with what is the 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.210
 rail whose extension to accommodate with 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.520
 with three levels to accommodate everything is 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.759
 all that is the area that on this side 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:43.170
 so why then also to accommodate 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.170
 all that spoons are 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:49.370
 hopefully it is the distribution 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.710
 the drawer we use a thickness of 20 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:55.080
 mm thickness extremely durable 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.620
 and therefore resistant 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.260
 and then let's hope that 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:03.440
 here in this case it would happen to what 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:08.180
 is the area of ​​the descent as it has 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:10.850
 a drawer without and two doors in the part 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:14.090
 at the bottom 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.560
 the same with equipment has several 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.290
 levels in the part of what is the 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.440
 steward to the deep scene in the 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.660
 top decorative molding 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.070
 has all the elements then 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.130
 decorative and very very good 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:34.150
 distribution and here this is area of this 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:37.990
 is the area of what is this what 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:40.440
 is the bar here for an area to 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.580
 to store different things or 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.400
 breakfast bar can also be used 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.890
 for several things, let's hope that with 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:52.940
 this explanation has been this 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:57.350
 well clear in the product line that 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:03:01.040
