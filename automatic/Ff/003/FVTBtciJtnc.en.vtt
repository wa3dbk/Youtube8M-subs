00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.840
 Overall a new book comes out but but 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.400
 What I will be running honest with you is said again in twenty 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.740
 And she gets a lot of publicity inc now because her new book is coming up 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.610
 And quite relevant to these times because of Romney being at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.090
 Race here in the presidential race in America 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.619
 Wish you talk about 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.230
 She was as he would give me a lot of money from Harry Potter books 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.890
 That evening we have about relocating abroad so you do not have to pay as much taxes here 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.820
 The first response said 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.189
 You and I are still just a taxpayers shop for one main couple reasons that I am 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.350
 One of my children grew up where it originated 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.400
 That the proper roots in the culture are all brilliant in Britain 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.510
 To be citizens with all that the real country implies 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.910
 Do not live express free float in limo some tax haven link only 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.030
 With a built-out tax evasion similarly greedy 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.680
 By عاشق فورا 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.970
 Now not all experts are greedy or 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.490
 Try to avoid taxes 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.200
 But certainly some of them 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.680
 She says I do not want to be with these guys that basic to do so do not be in it 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.020
 The room and it's quite right 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.290
 But the second part of it, it is better says: 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.110
 The second reason however 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.130
 That was what I owe to the British welfare state 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.870
 The same Mr. Cameron wants to replace charitable charity 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.400
 When my rocky bottom reached life that the hefty safety net though became 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.299
 Under John's specializations government " 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:24.350
 There was to break the fall 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.850
 I can not feel so it was the poorest 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.010
 An enemy just for the West Indies in Neve 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.280
 Of the Seven Kings check number 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.110
 If you like this idea is my national s 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.580
 here here 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.420
 Uh ... he or so 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.710
 This is absolutely true 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.150
 MIT am remembering Romney 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.770
 It may also help the US welfare state 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.790
 His father when he first moved from Mexico to the United States was in 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.280
 The Mormon complex came in Mexico and it is here 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.359
 Health care point 

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:01.189
 The MIT Romney is now boasting about it but was behind the bridge as burning 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.000
 You pay all taxes 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.570
 Hi 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.400
 Now I'm not just 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.449
 Has not paid about thirty percent of taxes in the years we know the heat 

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:13.519
 I popped in one part without any here on the menu just all the way up at 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.069
 Forty percent WOW 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.240
 But there is someone who is the Cayman Islands money 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.130
 As money is in the Bermuda area of ​​money in the Swiss bank in China and Kansas 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.139
 Everywhere 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:24.919
 But it is not just that 

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:27.740
 It turned out that nothing was also called 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.519
 I'll be in jeans 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.150
 I knew what inspired him 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.969
 It turned out he was called to Amda 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:36.809
 defective 

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:38.750
 Guarantor Trucks 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.799
 Amazing is that 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:42.469
 Is the shelter attached 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:47.659
 That in the title says the defect deliberately 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:51.339
 What other new accounts for the rich is called 

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:52.349
 They call it 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:53.589
 i_d_ 

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:55.349
 Uh ... literally until another u_n_ 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.449
 You see g_t_e_ i_d_ so get it from there but it will simply because it is 

00:02:58.449 --> 00:03:01.999
 Lets them avoid all taxes 

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:03.849
 What to do with this 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.539
 He had made a hundred million dollars to move him to seemingly trustworthy 

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:10.479
 Again you're doing a great effort is this reasonable 

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:13.870
 And now that Rooney because of trust tracking and financial accounting because 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.119
 From a good investment in DoubleClick 

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:21.049
 One of the existence and return of the hundred percent rate of acidity wife living in the American dream 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.159
 No problems yet 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:25.209
 Now here is the pillar 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:30.169
 U property tax if transferred by your children and grandchildren is 55 percent 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:34.259
 A gift tax also prevents a split in you from passing it right away 

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:35.739
 So if you pay that 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.049
 But of course the bottom line is not who I am 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:40.289
 Is to avoid going out 

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:43.999
 So you know what percentage but I think 8 instead 

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:46.509
 Zero percent 

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:47.889
 zero 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:50.839
 The 100,000,000 dollar confidence you learn is lacking for you 

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:53.729
 $ 55 million 

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:58.889
 He does not pay his five million dollars from doing this 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:01.749
 'The reason we had the people's war somehow was right 

00:04:01.749 --> 00:04:07.119
 We have a social safety net this week but we also have support ordeal 

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:11.019
 We have all the things and then locally the Firemans cup helper teacher 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:12.659
 Light in pay so gotta 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:17.749
 And the Lord knows that the Lord looks alike I confess there is not much of that 

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:19.870
 So he takes his money works 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.619
 Be it in the Cayman Islands or through these 

00:04:22.619 --> 00:04:24.849
 Tricks trust in fact 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:28.450
 Stephen Stone is now a bright law firm 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.919
 Which are familiar with these tricks Ann said quote 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:33.680
 Romney is used 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.020
 Every trick in the book 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.970
 It will be difficult to do in the future tax planning 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.819
 He brought attention to things that were not getting attention now I love 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:44.379
 This quote 

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:45.260
 Because 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.780
 Sent madness loves the whole world knows each new contractual crew 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:51.560
 To protect the farm 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.790
 The burden on the middle class and the poor has shifted 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.860
 Cherish 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.590
 In some missing that appear in the contradiction between Rolling 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:02.779
 And Romney 

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:05.229
 She tells you everything you need to know about Rooney 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:06.380
 And what kind of man he is
