00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.059
 and 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.730
 Hello, Ilya Kolmanovsky is 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.860
 project parallels i think that soon not 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.470
 there will be no minutes tablets beeches 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.910
 desktops now we live in an era when 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.250
 formats of these personal 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.650
 computers are multiplying but we remember 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.480
 will this era with nostalgia such 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.000
 cyber affection over all these 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.739
 gadgets will only smartphone 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.020
 the main reason why we are today 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:42.140
 need something other than a phone this 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.940
 physical properties of the interface to the smartphone 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.040
 almost fast enough to 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.900
 solve any everyday 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.760
 custom tasks and problems and places 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.160
 there are no clouds on the disk 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.990
 The problem remains in the interface as I have already 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.850
 said here in the keyboard in the mouse in 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.950
 monitor it all has to be big 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.140
 otherwise uncomfortable but these elements 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.970
 the interface actually came up with more than 50 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.020
 years ago and they lose relevance 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.759
 we are right before our eyes 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.670
 for example, here's a quick improvement 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:10.100
 voice input glasses instead of monitor 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.200
 gesture control all these advances 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.899
 point in one direction do not turn 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.939
 all air is made easier to access 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:19.329
 the virtual world will be provided in any 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:22.009
 moment of light and wearable devices 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:23.719
 it means of all formats only 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.460
 phone will remain important 

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:28.060
 communicator which transmits our 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.799
 teams or just thoughts on the clouds and 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.959
 forwarding video pictures from there and 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.789
 text us right in the brain and today 

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:37.039
 I note one a little noticeable but 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:39.409
 eloquent detail in favor of my 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:41.539
 hypotheses remember about a year ago all 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.340
 admired the ideas of the Dutch enthusiast 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:46.069
 before his hawkins do smartphones 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.439
 modular to be in the niche 

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:49.219
 replace separate tap processor memory 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:50.959
 from such cubes 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:53.580
 it seemed like fun fantasy 

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:55.470
 European such happy dreamer 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.510
 and then suddenly I bought it on the vine 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.100
 google and today google says that on 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.400
 the market this phone will be next 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.410
 year 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.870
 the metal frame itself will cost 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:06.570
 about $ 50 no one expected that 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.130
 the idea will become mainstream as quickly and here 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.830
 This situation tells us that's what 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.870
 Before, the smartphone was so stamped and 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.370
 whole face the device you need 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.500
 only at a certain point in 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.110
 certain situations well how are we not 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.870
 waiting for what can be replaced by different 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.320
 elements in the iron or say in the sank go 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.750
 and go 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.750
 but if the smartphone is $ where exactly 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.620
 and the whole life happens then already 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.110
 naturally it is no longer machines 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.440
 car and of course it is necessary and 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.820
 you can change all all the elements and google 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.010
 already shows a prototype of such 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.270
 silver endoskeletons are different 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.610
 modular units that will 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.070
 join the device using 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.300
 electro permanent magnets 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.110
 lock or unlock 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.780
 components will allow special 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.820
 google application basically allows 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.840
 third-party developers to sell on 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.820
 market all blocks 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.330
 leaves only the frame from 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.980
 central source of income and know-how 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.600
 some modules will be printed in 3d 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.610
 while users can 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.459
 customize the look 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.130
 components by choosing any texture or 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.989
 surface image 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.730
 so we are in the google office and and i 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.390
 I will show you now who is working on 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.390
 oro project 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:27.370
 adeev hello welcome hello i am 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.230
 Eric Gunter I work in a sauce company 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.580
 limited 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:36.100
 i jeff blank from team 3 to systems this 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:42.100
 so cool thing i put i 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:43.630
 yourself a platoon on the desktop here are people 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.450
 which differ projection behind 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:49.780
 the technical side of the matter i'm ara i 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.730
 I lead a group of iron I'm fed newberg I'm 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.730
 responsible for engineering teams and 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.250
 we have software developers here 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.020
 new processor board under the application 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.910
 and on it we launched android here we 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.010
 connected display and touchscreen 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.350
 we use this fee to 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.670
 test the operating system different 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.670
 applications and drivers 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.950
 teams with this developed technology 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.780
 which allows you to fix the modules 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.140
 phones using combo 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.919
 electro permanent magnets have such 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:29.560
 the groove that fixes the module 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:34.330
 earned here we fix a little 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.770
 there is a small gap there is no power yes 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:42.460
 he doesn't need food right now 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:44.200
 connected I danil makovsky and you 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.120
 I submit a group of design and division 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.370
 a flock of advanced technology and 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.200
 google projects and when we came up with that 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.729
 modular phone we realized that electro 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.200
 permanent magnets are just what 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:55.060
 will provide durability this modular 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.160
 designs and then thought about how 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.780
 should look like the body and realized that we 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.640
 let's not close the modules in a separate 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.070
 the body is a modular whole 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.770
 aesthetics such a philosophy we should not 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.150
 hiding in the phone does not seem 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.860
 we could not find a designer 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.350
 decisions are better than just making that 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:14.320
 the phone lives and adapts to the environment 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:17.340
 exactly as we ourselves and that in itself 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.340
 important philosophy 

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:23.389
 hi i'm jeff blank i'm from a team 

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:25.309
 Before the system, our company is engaged 

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:28.749
 3d printing technology development 

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:31.489
 product customization for the project 

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:33.439
 the most important problem here is to guess 

00:05:31.489 --> 00:05:36.139
 with the property of materials that they were 

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:38.449
 strong they were hard to break and we 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:41.209
 for now just go simple colors 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:43.249
 different designs but what seems 

00:05:41.209 --> 00:05:44.899
 even more challenging you 

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:47.259
 which bring out the release of the final 

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:49.909
 product at some final power 

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:52.159
 he is not called eric wander i am the founder 

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:54.049
 sauce companies ul limited we work in 

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:55.849
 very close to the spikes in the department ATOR 

00:05:54.049 --> 00:05:58.279
 google to make custom 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:00.619
 application interface Gaara configurators 

00:05:58.279 --> 00:06:02.179
 and such an application that will allow you 

00:06:00.619 --> 00:06:04.099
 explore the entire range 

00:06:02.179 --> 00:06:06.379
 component parts available by project 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:08.089
 macaw and pick the right configuration 

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:10.309
 for different types of phones here because 

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:12.769
 how many people have never before 

00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:14.329
 took a smartphone in hand and we need 

00:06:12.769 --> 00:06:18.139
 make the interface and just simple and 

00:06:14.329 --> 00:06:21.229
 as intuitively as possible in your borscht 

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:24.339
 theory with you was me q man of ski project 

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:24.339
 parallels she's you
