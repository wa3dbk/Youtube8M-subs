00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.530
 pay these are the ingredients we 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.510
 let's use for our recipe today in 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.170
 a pot on the low fire we go 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:05.010
 to put the calabrese sausage you need 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.740
 put oil and olive oil did not learn that 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.010
 already has its culture 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.390
 we are at the point that we want 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.840
 put out the fire 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:20.410

 in a bowl we'll put the rice 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.330
 Look how rice is just people. 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.320
 we already have the adjusted revenue of this 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.320

 the grated parmesan cheese and stir 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.390
 In this mix we will not put 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:46.620
 seasoning because the rice is already federated 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.600
 grated Parmesan cheese with 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:52.200
 we will put the baking powder into 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.390
 cake but here is not to grow not the 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:59.130
 His function here is to put it. 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:02.580

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.830
 Let's put the cornstarch and let's 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.790

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:11.430
 mix well with the spoon we make 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:14.360
 pressure with the spoon of rice that 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.360
 is well taken care of 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.920
 now with our hands we're going to embrace this 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.920
 rice 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:29.540
 we are tightening and so on until all 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:32.000
 ingredients blend we know 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.730
 which is already at the point when we get 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.630
 a piece yes the grandfather amount and 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.630

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.140

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.580
 in the mass and we will make the balls of 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.150
 since then we put the beauty 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.150
 inside 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.630
 we repeat we turn we do 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.069
 as well as the rest of the mass of 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.349
 rice 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.800
 We're going to put the sausage now. 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:12.400
 first let's do from cheating 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:14.650
 We're going to hit the light and the gem is not 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.160
 to stay with kenny agnaldo's mix 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.260
 of the yolk gets a little snow when 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:25.750
 is only the canopy 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:28.120
 now we're going to put the milk and now 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.209
 We 're going to put pepper in the door 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.940
 year was in pay many in goal 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:37.180
 we do not put in rice we do not put 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:40.630
 I love this option but it gets very 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:43.739
 delicious 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:46.480
 to fool our embroidery 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.790
 now we're going to put that prey 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.200
 inside the rice cookie then with the 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:55.150
 help of a handle of a small spoon 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:57.220
 We do birth so we can 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:02.859
 put as many pieces as we want 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:06.150
 we have here when he's well on 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:06.150
 rice medium time 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:17.420
 if you want you can put two three pieces 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.420
 Now we're going to spend here again, look. 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.880
 and we pass the breadcrumbs we are 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.710
 that is 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.190
 Let's do it now with all the 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.190

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.729
 So we finished patching the 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.460
 our polka dots 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:44.669

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.080
 we put it on the high fire for we do not know 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.690
 it's at the point 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.990
 we took a wooden spoon and 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:55.289
 we put it here people look at it 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.849
 point for making can not be oil 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:05:00.780
 because it does not close with the 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:03.539
 cookies and looks very hot burns but 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:07.520
 Let's leave the balls here for the time. 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:07.520

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:19.590
 Here we stand , look at us now. 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:21.780
