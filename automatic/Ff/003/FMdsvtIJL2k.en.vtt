suda51 promised that this game would be
more<00:05:33.650> violent<00:05:34.040> than<00:05:34.130> manhunt<00:05:34.520> too<00:05:34.790> and<00:05:35.090> as<00:05:35.240> far

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:35.420 
more violent than manhunt too and as far

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.030 
more violent than manhunt too and as far

as I know nobody's really gotten back to

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:44.700 
as I know nobody's really gotten back to
us<00:05:37.100> on<00:05:37.280> this<00:05:37.400> so<00:05:37.850> I<00:05:37.880> guess<00:05:38.090> I'll<00:05:38.240> check

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.100 

I<00:05:44.740> guess<00:05:45.700> No<00:05:45.940> More<00:05:46.120> Heroes<00:05:46.150> wins<00:05:46.690> by<00:05:46.930> default

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
I guess No More Heroes wins by default

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.750 
I guess No More Heroes wins by default
just<00:05:47.560> because<00:05:47.770> I<00:05:47.860> can<00:05:48.010> actually<00:05:48.310> see<00:05:48.580> what's

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:48.760 
just because I can actually see what's

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.920 
just because I can actually see what's
going<00:05:48.820> on<00:05:51.180> one<00:05:52.180> last<00:05:52.210> thing<00:05:52.570> I<00:05:52.660> have<00:05:52.810> to

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930 
going on one last thing I have to

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.480 
going on one last thing I have to
address<00:05:53.170> or<00:05:53.440> the<00:05:53.560> 8-bit<00:05:53.800> sounds<00:05:54.280> and<00:05:54.400> looks

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 
address or the 8-bit sounds and looks

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.430 
address or the 8-bit sounds and looks
incorporated<00:05:55.210> into<00:05:55.300> this<00:05:55.480> game<00:05:55.750> I<00:05:56.080> think

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
incorporated into this game I think

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.260
