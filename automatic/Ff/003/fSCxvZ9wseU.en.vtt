not syncing the headphone jack is pretty

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.840 
not syncing the headphone jack is pretty
deep<00:01:35.130> in<00:01:35.340> there<00:01:35.399> so<00:01:36.090> they<00:01:36.209> give<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.539> this<00:01:37.850> to

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
deep in there so they give you this to

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.969 
deep in there so they give you this to
kind<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.090> reach<00:01:39.330> in<00:01:39.569> there<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:40.530> want<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.770> plug

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
kind of reach in there you want to plug

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.499 
kind of reach in there you want to plug
in<00:01:41.130> some<00:01:41.280> headphones<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:41.880> have<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.119> use<00:01:42.299> this

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
in some headphones you have to use this

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.029 
in some headphones you have to use this
dongle<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.380> do<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:44.990> and<00:01:45.990> that's<00:01:46.770> just<00:01:46.920> because

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
dongle to do so and that's just because

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:49.880 
dongle to do so and that's just because
of<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.340> little<00:01:47.670> chin<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:49.109> the<00:01:49.439> juice<00:01:49.859> pack

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
of the little chin that the juice pack

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.980 
of the little chin that the juice pack
has<00:01:50.310> there<00:01:50.609> as<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:51.299> can<00:01:51.420> see<00:01:51.600> here<00:01:51.780> on<00:01:51.869> the

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
has there as you can see here on the

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.669 
has there as you can see here on the
front<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:53.159> have<00:01:53.280> two<00:01:53.460> speakers<00:01:53.789> there

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
front you have two speakers there

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:57.859 
front you have two speakers there
basically<00:01:55.679> it<00:01:55.920> routes<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.640> sound<00:01:57.210> in<00:01:57.570> the

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
basically it routes the sound in the

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.980 
basically it routes the sound in the
speakers<00:01:58.320> through<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.219> front<00:01:59.490> so<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.539> sound

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
speakers through the front so the sound

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.560 
speakers through the front so the sound
comes<00:02:01.289> at<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.799> instead<00:02:02.070> of<00:02:02.340> pointing<00:02:02.579> down

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
comes at you instead of pointing down

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.550 
comes at you instead of pointing down
away<00:02:04.020> from<00:02:04.049> you<00:02:04.490> and<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.820> really<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.560> so

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
away from you and that is really it so

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.509 
away from you and that is really it so
