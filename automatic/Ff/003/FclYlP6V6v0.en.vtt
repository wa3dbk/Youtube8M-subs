00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
out like this you do a much you cover a

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.960 
out like this you do a much you cover a

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
lot of space first and then you get more

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.690 
lot of space first and then you get more
precise<00:01:45.479> with<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.560> intensity<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.460> see<00:01:47.610> I'm

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
precise with the intensity you see I'm

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.719 
precise with the intensity you see I'm
