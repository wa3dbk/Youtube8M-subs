us about twenty-nine and four and there
you<00:03:54.030> go<00:03:54.060> and<00:03:54.359> this<00:03:54.540> is<00:03:54.659> the<00:03:54.719> shot<00:03:54.900> that<00:03:55.019> I<00:03:55.079> hit<00:03:55.199> I

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
you go and this is the shot that I hit I

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.039

those<00:03:59.669> were<00:03:59.969> not<00:04:00.269> deserving<00:04:00.810> deaths<00:04:01.259> really

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:02.129 
those were not deserving deaths really

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:03.199 
those were not deserving deaths really
because<00:04:02.219> you<00:04:02.310> know<00:04:02.400> I<00:04:02.459> was<00:04:02.579> trickshotting<00:04:03.000> and

more<00:04:13.949> beat<00:04:14.099> the<00:04:14.189> clock<00:04:14.340> I<00:04:14.579> think<00:04:14.819> so<00:04:14.969> that's

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:15.659 
more beat the clock I think so that's
