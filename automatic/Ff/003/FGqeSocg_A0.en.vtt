the<00:01:43.230> inner<00:01:43.410> corner<00:01:43.830> and<00:01:44.010> this<00:01:44.130> also<00:01:44.340> helps<00:01:44.790> to

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
the inner corner and this also helps to

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.420 
the inner corner and this also helps to
brighten<00:01:45.150> up<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.450> eyes<00:01:45.570> as<00:01:45.780> well<00:01:46.280> so<00:01:47.280> now

brighten up the eyes as well so now

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.980 
brighten up the eyes as well so now
