00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.800
 A vehicle 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.800

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:50.239
 I have acrobatic jump found 1250 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:55.970
 single acrobatic jumps completed 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:57.559
 650 is worth 1250 650 record remember that not 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.610
 we are going online to wait a moment 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.610
 what am I going to silence 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.680
 accident is worth 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:12.130
 well once we've seen that 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:15.940
 it was 1250 650 we got to make a 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:19.210
 activity that the host created by 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:22.250
 rotate and a race here as we search 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:25.680
 the one under the center 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:28.940
 under the center here is 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.940
 I'm not afraid of her 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:36.560
 well once we get to the race 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.020
 there is the activity 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.610
 we will put it without traffic to make it 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.070
 faster 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.720
 It's daytime and it's not going up 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.860
 so you can perform 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:55.480
 the race much faster here put 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:58.360
 standard super morning cloudless traffic 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:01.720
 no and that's it 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.090
 and here we give you to confirm play as 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.520
 You see, I'm doing it on my own, but if 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.810
 I wanted to do it with a friend, you can 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.830
 make easily 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:15.630

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.940
 to continue and 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:22.650
 just leave in the race 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.650
 all we have to do is 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.689
 to make this very easy 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:34.140
 you remember that we had 12 56 50 and 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.140
 we go here 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.080

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.800

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.750

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.750
 if we go over the bridge up 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.260
 and we hit precisely 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.189

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.180
