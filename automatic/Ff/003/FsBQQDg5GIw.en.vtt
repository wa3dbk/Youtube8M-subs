you

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.380 

let's<00:01:14.260> now<00:01:14.500> understand<00:01:15.130> how<00:01:15.310> reproduction<00:01:16.240> in

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
let's now understand how reproduction in

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.210 
let's now understand how reproduction in
plants<00:01:16.840> is<00:01:16.990> brought<00:01:17.650> about<00:01:19.890> pollination<00:01:20.890> and

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
plants is brought about pollination and

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.880 
plants is brought about pollination and
fertilization<00:01:21.880> are<00:01:22.480> the<00:01:23.110> two<00:01:23.290> major<00:01:23.560> events

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
fertilization are the two major events

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.880 
fertilization are the two major events
that<00:01:24.520> bring<00:01:24.820> about<00:01:24.870> reproduction

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.560 

pollination<00:01:29.890> is<00:01:30.040> simply<00:01:30.640> the<00:01:30.820> transfer<00:01:31.330> of

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
pollination is simply the transfer of

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.260 
pollination is simply the transfer of
pollen<00:01:31.810> from<00:01:32.530> the<00:01:32.740> anther<00:01:33.250> to<00:01:33.430> the<00:01:33.580> stigma<00:01:33.940> of

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
pollen from the anther to the stigma of

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.510 
pollen from the anther to the stigma of
the<00:01:34.780> pistil<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:38.320> stigma<00:01:38.740> receives<00:01:39.220> the

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
the pistil the stigma receives the

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.140 
the pistil the stigma receives the
pollen<00:01:39.850> grains<00:01:41.370> pollen<00:01:42.370> grains<00:01:42.640> can<00:01:43.090> be

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
pollen grains pollen grains can be

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.930 
pollen grains pollen grains can be
carried<00:01:43.660> from<00:01:44.229> anthers<00:01:44.800> to<00:01:45.040> the<00:01:45.160> stigma<00:01:45.670> by

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
carried from anthers to the stigma by

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:52.859 
carried from anthers to the stigma by
wind<00:01:46.270> water<00:01:47.110> or<00:01:47.500> insects<00:01:51.300> pollen<00:01:52.300> trapped<00:01:52.630> by

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
wind water or insects pollen trapped by

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.469 
wind water or insects pollen trapped by
the<00:01:52.930> stigma<00:01:53.560> germinates<00:01:54.280> to<00:01:54.580> produce<00:01:54.970> a<00:01:55.180> long

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
the stigma germinates to produce a long

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.580 
the stigma germinates to produce a long
tube<00:01:55.830> which<00:01:56.830> travels<00:01:57.340> down<00:01:57.610> the<00:01:57.850> style<00:01:58.180> and

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
tube which travels down the style and

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.030 
tube which travels down the style and
enters<00:01:59.590> the<00:01:59.619> ovary<00:02:00.310> the<00:02:01.770> pollen<00:02:02.770> tube

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
enters the ovary the pollen tube

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.130 
enters the ovary the pollen tube
contains<00:02:03.970> the<00:02:04.240> male<00:02:04.420> gamete<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:06.610> male<00:02:06.790> gamete

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
contains the male gamete the male gamete

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.690 
contains the male gamete the male gamete
fuses<00:02:08.140> with<00:02:08.380> the<00:02:08.410> female<00:02:08.920> gamete<00:02:09.190> in<00:02:09.459> the
