00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.840
 and clear 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:11.440
 has even been welcomed once 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:13.990
 more to forget a cold 4 lately 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:17.500
 I'm playing a lot oblitera gration 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.420
 and for what reason it is by far my way of 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.640
 favorite game in fact it even gives me a 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.099
 little sadness that yet phil 3 that 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.750
 it was such a good game because this mode of 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.790
 game they would not have put it I know that 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.189
 conquest and assault will always be like this 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.349
 as the core of the game the core what 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.180
 people want to play what they do most 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.420
 but it is that I lead jon has something 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.940
 special that is that that war 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.769
 intense by going to try to take in the 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.050
 bomb and carry the goal of defending 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:45.519
 yours and when a game is played 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.109
 well and I say that the two teams are 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:50.320
 really trying like that one that's 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:52.059
 attacks and on a map that I do not know this is the 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.219
 map of the loves and the terrors of 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.050
 Lots of people in the cloud are some 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:59.050
 people decide that it is a horrible map 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.129
 where you have too many levels and I 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.960
 I think it's a problem of 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.629
 development of variation 4 that they did 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.950
 too multilevel then it costs you 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.659
 very much when you are a soldier of 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.340
 infantry you have to go running by 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.750
 all sides trying to spot all 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.150
 possible window 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.620
 in fact etcetera because an enemy 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.300
 could be where it was and obviously 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.220
 with vehicles that are a little bit more 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.979
 limited on television that are not 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.080
 we are not saying that in the amount that 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.260
 you see conquer then the kind of 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.520
 game can be much better 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.200
 and at least I like it much more 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.930
 there are enough vehicles so that 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.920
 be absolutely and completely 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.810
 desperate and here I was trying 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.860
 to guide the one who carries the bomb 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.020
 obviously how am I playing with 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.350
 great violence we go and it did not follow me 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.520
 here but also part of the game is 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.680
 try to locate where are the 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.899
 enemies and try to clear the way 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.030
 even if you take the bomb a 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:50.920
 great thing in this game mode that 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.440
 even if you kill few people but you know 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.200
 move around the map is very very fun 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.030
 especially if and I do not know maybe there's 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.410
 someone asked me on another day if I could 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.420
 give a little advice for those who 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.190
 they are more novices in baron field and one 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.509
 the most important tips that 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.259
 I can give for those who are learning 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:10.600
 to play the saga is to stay alive 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.920
 it's the most I do not know about the most 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.870
 rewarding and also the most 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.610
 fun that you can have the game here 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.330
 I am using a carbine that is the 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.490
 to 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.050
 and 12 that is a very good weapon but 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.130
 lately I was doing many 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.320
 gun reviews so I'm not going 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.490
 speak specifically the weapon is 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.720
 I just use it because I like it 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.450
 because it has a good balance because 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.070
 it is also the closest thing to ak-47 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.140
 that you can not get because really 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.510
 in the game they did not put them but see 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.950
 how I moved around the map from the 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.300
 right to the left where I had 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.450
 the type of pump to achieve 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.950
 to the enemy target obviously some 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.630
 things go wrong and as I told you before in 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.890
 the game is very very compared 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.360
 then here the enemies too 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.460
 they were really trying to play with 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.860
 the goal and that makes it very fun 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.630
 and we are literally centimeters 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.500
 of in as we wanted to destroy for 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.400
 to be able to plant the pump 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.900
 eventually a partner us if 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.100
 I arrived and managed to plant it but I no longer 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.980
 I was there on the battlefield like this 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.140
 that I decided that I had to go fight for 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.190
 another side now in eradication as you 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.410
 is saying one of the most things 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.320
 important and good is not really the 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.700
 medication in any game mode 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.230
 stay alive is not only 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.760
 important because you can give more 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.990
 opportunity to your team to win and 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.160
 we are obviously talking from the 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.209
 point of view of someone who wants 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.489
 play the goal because a lot of people 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.810
 enter to play baron or any shooter 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.940
 really only 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.849
 to prove his fifth treason and the 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.760
 Hamas targets use them as 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:34.660
 points where the lousy ones will come 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.370
 aim for 10 points where they go to 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.750
 try to bring people so that 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.819
 they can shoot and if they want to play 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.319
 at an interest rate more in oblique and not 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.640
 he reads television as good and everyone 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:44.800
 because each one will decide how he wants 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.209
 play your game or we all pay 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.560
 money to want to play if some 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:51.790
 they want to change champions and others 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:53.410
 they want to play a duel to the death without 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.730
 objectives by objectives as you want 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.830
 call because it's a matter of each and 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.090
 how do you want to use the game personally 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.830
 I think the middle piggy and it's better 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.720
 the people who want to play the goal 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.100
 when they are playing the objectives valga 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.200
 the redundancy and if you're looking 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:08.019
 eradication try to play defend 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:09.849
 and attack and try to define or 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:12.700
 break up into groups and heal account 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:14.230
 that they can kill many 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.359
 people if you're trying to do that 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.519
 for example here I know that the pump is 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.139
 once again on the enemy playing field 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.880
 I am trying to advance by their 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:24.100
 lines but obviously I'm killing people 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.450
 as fort they do not see progressed and the 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.600
 same point what you are saying before 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.520
 the most important 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.220
 in stranded and at least I feel I 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.780
 is to learn to stay alive to know 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.760
 move around the map in reality 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.830
 only really all the shooters 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.750
 etam in one thing if you manage to keep yourself 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.820
 I live two minutes three minutes four 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.410
 minutes followed by gameplay the game is 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.600
 it makes you so much more fun and 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.880
 absolutely epic from the point of 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.980
 view of you versus the people who entered 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.200
 directly like hens without heads 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.970
 directly try to enter the field 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.200
 of battle without having measured a bit 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.520
 where are the enemies where are your 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.930
 colleagues where are the areas where 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.920
 you can really do a little bit of 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.730
 harm without you getting hurt by you and 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.430
 eliminate vehicles that are 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.810
 hurting the opposing team of 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.700
 opposing team rather that they are 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.800
 hurting you and keeping you 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:13.080
 I live those minutes that are going to help you 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.720
 you obviously to look for the bomb already 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.580
 try to look for the pump in this mode 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.080
 of game but it would be any other type 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.260
 of goal that you're playing either 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:24.030
 jump and be 2 conquest to give you 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.249
 much more validity to the game and that 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:28.439
 make you much more fun 

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:29.939
 always assume that they have marked you in the 

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:32.339
 map for example and when I was already 

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:33.779
 trying to flee at the moment that a 

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:35.549
 enemy saw you it is very easy to believe in the 

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:36.689
 cube given to the selector by putting 

00:05:35.549 --> 00:05:39.419
 the button that is depends on whether it is 

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:42.989
 playing in console is being played in or 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:44.759
 if you are playing on pc and make sure that if 

00:05:42.989 --> 00:05:46.199
 you have been marked you have to change the 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:48.059
 approach in the place where you are 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:49.919
 arriving because obviously if you try to 

00:05:48.059 --> 00:05:51.689
 reach the entire enemy always from 

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:53.309
 the front and they are already marked they are going 

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:54.929
 let's see my dad has exactly where 

00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:56.249
 are you going to be other reasons why I 

00:05:54.929 --> 00:05:58.439
 they like television is because it is not 

00:05:56.249 --> 00:06:00.269
 the famous commander mode that is not that 

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:01.889
 I dislike but all the ibis that 

00:06:00.269 --> 00:06:03.509
 they were the sky immediately in up 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:05.429
 the feeling of being able to move around the 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:06.809
 map without you p screen just for 

00:06:05.429 --> 00:06:08.519
 that's because it's always appear 

00:06:06.809 --> 00:06:10.319
 marked on the map where I know you have 

00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:12.360
 you guys on this if you think it's a good 

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:13.739
 advice you already know that if you liked the 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.759
 video can give a like and favorites 

00:06:13.739 --> 00:06:16.469
 because we are about to reach the 

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:18.089
 end and if not what they please and 

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:20.339
 from below your comments because as 

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:21.929
 they are always super valuable and even the 

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:23.639
 next time by the way of upload l 

00:06:21.929 --> 00:06:25.019
 want in another channel because as is the 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:26.249
 world cup we are very interested 

00:06:25.019 --> 00:06:27.719
 watching football matches and 

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:29.030
 he really did not give him the letters so 

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:32.620
 I apologize that but 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.620
 I'm going from here to people
