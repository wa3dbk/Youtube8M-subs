00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.880
 case we are going to have how we can fix the error when recording 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.999
 with a software program in this case I study 7 percent 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:31.419
 not only cut and watching the image is well appreciated today the video here 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:32.760
 we did 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.950
 and well that this day and even for xp is in me in my channel can look for it 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:38.640
 there 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.820
 I think I know the last video fisher 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.700
 from 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.020
 and good percent this video if special for windows 7 the institute 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.670
 so 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.010
 let's start for a hundred we have to get to the desk 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.010
 Tarongí right only show solutions screen 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.950
 we're going to those who crossed out that I did advanced configuration 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.600
 our life is 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.320
 now we're going to this option says solve 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.260
 problem solver 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.190
 we come to this option of the no of new account change the configuration 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.920
 and the senasa vida are you 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.240
 what we have to do 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.150
 is to lower it to what is this 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.810
 to none 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.020
 what because external we do not have to go down well 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.020
 in what 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.660
 that what obviously thinks that what weighs 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.500
 in me my computer in the download we must accept 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.170
 in this case and in the opposition and it works very well and pc well 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.259
 and maybe we should accept that is not to change the screen in black let's see 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.729
 we wait like the three seconds and change to normal 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.160
 and well now what we will do these computer forecasts in this almost I do not 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.110
 I did it 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.170
 I just 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.930
 nor open account and life program 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.339
 in him percent this benicio 

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:14.449
 sword making sure that it works is what we just did 

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:21.139
 this horror rather this testimony muxía a horror 

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:26.539
 is very capable is very scarce in what is windows 7 and is that the windows 7 

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:27.639
 in the and this 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:30.759
 only in the elvis style windows 

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:31.709
 and good 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.739
