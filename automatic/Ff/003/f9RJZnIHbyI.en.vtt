actual like lip thingy itself got all
over<00:05:16.440> my<00:05:16.800> Invisalign<00:05:17.220> and<00:05:17.400> then<00:05:17.520> I<00:05:17.580> couldn't

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
over my Invisalign and then I couldn't

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.400 
over my Invisalign and then I couldn't
get<00:05:17.970> it<00:05:18.120> often<00:05:18.419> it<00:05:18.479> was<00:05:18.600> like<00:05:18.720> all<00:05:18.990> over<00:05:19.229> it

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
get it often it was like all over it

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.080 
get it often it was like all over it
just<00:05:19.470> kept<00:05:19.800> on<00:05:19.889> getting<00:05:20.010> on<00:05:20.280> my<00:05:20.430> aligners<00:05:20.850> and

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
just kept on getting on my aligners and

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.450 
just kept on getting on my aligners and
it<00:05:21.539> was<00:05:21.660> super<00:05:21.930> frustrating<00:05:22.710> and<00:05:22.860> then<00:05:23.370> the

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
it was super frustrating and then the

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:24.680 
it was super frustrating and then the
color<00:05:23.669> just<00:05:23.910> didn't<00:05:24.210> look<00:05:24.330> good<00:05:24.510> it<00:05:24.660> just

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
color just didn't look good it just

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.750 
color just didn't look good it just
looked<00:05:24.990> really<00:05:25.139> crappy<00:05:25.830> and<00:05:26.100> dry<00:05:26.370> and<00:05:26.669> just

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
looked really crappy and dry and just

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.450 
looked really crappy and dry and just
chalky<00:05:27.419> it<00:05:27.630> just<00:05:27.930> wasn't<00:05:28.380> a<00:05:28.410> good<00:05:28.440> color<00:05:28.800> so<00:05:29.430> I

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
chalky it just wasn't a good color so I

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.920 
chalky it just wasn't a good color so I
definitely<00:05:29.970> recommend<00:05:30.180> trying<00:05:30.600> out<00:05:30.810> the

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
definitely recommend trying out the

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.690 
definitely recommend trying out the
other<00:05:31.080> colors<00:05:31.470> of<00:05:31.770> this<00:05:31.950> line<00:05:32.160> because<00:05:32.190> this

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700 
other colors of this line because this

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.879 
other colors of this line because this
is<00:05:32.880> actually<00:05:33.060> a<00:05:33.270> cool<00:05:33.479> product<00:05:34.470> but<00:05:34.680> this

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:34.889 
is actually a cool product but this

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:36.650 
is actually a cool product but this
color<00:05:35.130> itself<00:05:35.550> just<00:05:35.880> didn't<00:05:36.210> work<00:05:36.300> for<00:05:36.330> me

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
color itself just didn't work for me

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.960 
color itself just didn't work for me

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.629 
extender setting spray this is sixteen
dollars<00:05:46.260> which<00:05:46.440> i<00:05:46.560> think<00:05:46.620> is<00:05:46.860> very<00:05:46.889> expensive

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639 
dollars which i think is very expensive

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:49.760 
dollars which i think is very expensive
for<00:05:48.210> a<00:05:48.240> drugstore<00:05:48.539> product<00:05:49.110> it<00:05:49.349> made<00:05:49.590> my<00:05:49.710> skin

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
for a drugstore product it made my skin

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.219 
for a drugstore product it made my skin
oily<00:05:50.280> err<00:05:50.310> the<00:05:50.910> days<00:05:51.090> that<00:05:51.300> I<00:05:51.360> use<00:05:51.599> this<00:05:51.840> to<00:05:52.139> the

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:52.229 
oily err the days that I use this to the

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:54.230 
oily err the days that I use this to the
day<00:05:52.380> that<00:05:52.410> I<00:05:52.650> didn't<00:05:52.950> put<00:05:53.099> anything<00:05:53.340> on<00:05:53.639> it

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
day that I didn't put anything on it

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.440 
day that I didn't put anything on it
actually<00:05:54.690> made<00:05:54.810> my<00:05:54.990> skin<00:05:55.050> look<00:05:55.650> worse

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:56.450 
actually made my skin look worse

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:59.180 
actually made my skin look worse
throughout<00:05:57.450> the<00:05:57.599> day<00:05:57.780> from<00:05:58.260> when<00:05:58.349> I<00:05:58.500> just<00:05:58.770> did

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.190 
throughout the day from when I just did

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.150 
throughout the day from when I just did
it<00:05:59.370> with<00:05:59.520> no<00:05:59.849> spray<00:06:00.210> at<00:06:00.330> all<00:06:00.650> so<00:06:01.650> if<00:06:01.830> you<00:06:01.950> are

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 
it with no spray at all so if you are

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.740 
it with no spray at all so if you are
oily<00:06:02.610> I<00:06:02.639> wouldn't<00:06:03.000> recommend<00:06:03.270> it<00:06:03.510> because<00:06:03.690> I

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
oily I wouldn't recommend it because I

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.360 
oily I wouldn't recommend it because I
really<00:06:04.050> think<00:06:04.289> it's<00:06:04.410> just<00:06:04.470> not<00:06:04.770> very<00:06:04.830> good<00:06:05.070> for

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 
really think it's just not very good for

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.850 
really think it's just not very good for
oily<00:06:05.520> skin<00:06:05.970> it<00:06:06.570> says<00:06:06.780> oil-free<00:06:07.229> again<00:06:07.530> and

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
oily skin it says oil-free again and

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.379 
oily skin it says oil-free again and
it's<00:06:08.130> supposed<00:06:08.430> to<00:06:08.490> go<00:06:08.700> with<00:06:08.880> their<00:06:09.030> like<00:06:09.180> pro

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:09.389 
it's supposed to go with their like pro

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:11.629 
it's supposed to go with their like pro
matte<00:06:09.599> line<00:06:09.810> but<00:06:10.169> it<00:06:10.650> didn't<00:06:10.919> set<00:06:11.099> my<00:06:11.130> makeup<00:06:11.520> I

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:11.639 
matte line but it didn't set my makeup I

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:13.310 
matte line but it didn't set my makeup I
did<00:06:11.789> it<00:06:11.940> didn't<00:06:12.210> make<00:06:12.300> my<00:06:12.510> makeup<00:06:12.720> stay<00:06:13.080> any

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.320 
did it didn't make my makeup stay any

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.279 
did it didn't make my makeup stay any
longer<00:06:13.560> than<00:06:14.010> when<00:06:14.280> when<00:06:14.820> I<00:06:14.849> used<00:06:15.090> it<00:06:15.360> with<00:06:15.690> no

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:16.289 
longer than when when I used it with no

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:18.560 
longer than when when I used it with no
spray<00:06:16.620> at<00:06:16.740> all<00:06:16.889> so<00:06:17.220> for<00:06:17.820> me<00:06:17.940> it's<00:06:18.240> just<00:06:18.330> kind<00:06:18.419> of

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:18.570 
spray at all so for me it's just kind of

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.060 
spray at all so for me it's just kind of
like<00:06:18.720> a<00:06:18.750> waste<00:06:18.960> of<00:06:19.110> a<00:06:19.229> product<00:06:19.620> I'm<00:06:19.740> probably

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.070 
like a waste of a product I'm probably

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.250 
like a waste of a product I'm probably
not<00:06:20.610> going<00:06:20.789> to<00:06:20.880> use<00:06:21.000> this<00:06:21.150> again<00:06:21.510> and<00:06:21.900> I<00:06:22.229> just

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:22.260 
not going to use this again and I just

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.400 
not going to use this again and I just
don't<00:06:22.919> think<00:06:23.250> it's<00:06:23.430> worth<00:06:23.970> the<00:06:24.000> 16<00:06:24.870> dollars<00:06:25.200> I

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:25.410 
don't think it's worth the 16 dollars I

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:27.500 
don't think it's worth the 16 dollars I
just<00:06:25.770> I<00:06:25.979> was<00:06:26.490> expecting<00:06:26.970> a<00:06:27.030> little<00:06:27.120> bit<00:06:27.330> more

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:27.510 
just I was expecting a little bit more

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.450 
just I was expecting a little bit more
and<00:06:27.810> I<00:06:27.960> honestly<00:06:28.200> just<00:06:28.440> felt<00:06:28.860> really<00:06:29.070> oily

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 
and I honestly just felt really oily

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.270 
and I honestly just felt really oily
when<00:06:29.580> I<00:06:29.669> used<00:06:29.880> it<00:06:30.000> so<00:06:30.270> as<00:06:31.200> far<00:06:31.349> as<00:06:31.410> the<00:06:31.620> spray

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 
when I used it so as far as the spray

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.100 
when I used it so as far as the spray
itself<00:06:32.669> it<00:06:32.849> sprays<00:06:33.150> out<00:06:33.300> a<00:06:33.479> really<00:06:33.660> nice<00:06:33.810> fine

itself it sprays out a really nice fine
mist<00:06:34.409> so<00:06:35.070> it's<00:06:35.190> not<00:06:35.280> if<00:06:35.430> you're<00:06:35.520> gonna<00:06:35.610> get
