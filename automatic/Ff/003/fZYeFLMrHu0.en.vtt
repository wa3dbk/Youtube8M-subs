00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
course of a day Honda didn't really

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.069 
course of a day Honda didn't really
change<00:00:37.309> this<00:00:37.489> model<00:00:37.879> very<00:00:37.910> much<00:00:38.300> during<00:00:38.899> the

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
change this model very much during the

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.110 
change this model very much during the
last<00:00:39.290> few<00:00:39.469> model<00:00:39.830> years<00:00:40.070> it's<00:00:40.370> a<00:00:40.550> stable

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
last few model years it's a stable

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.020 
last few model years it's a stable
platform<00:00:41.740> the<00:00:42.740> motor<00:00:42.920> is<00:00:43.070> still<00:00:43.280> based<00:00:43.550> on<00:00:43.820> the

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
platform the motor is still based on the

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.770 
platform the motor is still based on the
CRF<00:00:44.510> 450<00:00:45.170> and<00:00:45.410> so<00:00:46.160> it's<00:00:46.490> a<00:00:46.760> it's<00:00:47.060> as<00:00:47.210> fast<00:00:47.480> as

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
CRF 450 and so it's a it's as fast as

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.480 
CRF 450 and so it's a it's as fast as
you<00:00:47.930> could<00:00:48.079> possibly<00:00:48.560> want<00:00:48.800> to<00:00:48.920> go<00:00:49.100> for<00:00:49.400> most

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:49.490 
you could possibly want to go for most

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.380 
you could possibly want to go for most
human<00:00:49.910> beings<00:00:50.410> at<00:00:51.410> the<00:00:51.620> same<00:00:51.829> time<00:00:52.130> it's<00:00:53.060> a

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
human beings at the same time it's a

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.540 
human beings at the same time it's a
little<00:00:53.660> more<00:00:53.870> reliable<00:00:54.470> it's<00:00:54.710> not<00:00:54.890> as<00:00:55.070> finicky

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
little more reliable it's not as finicky

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.210 
little more reliable it's not as finicky
it's<00:00:55.850> not<00:00:56.060> as<00:00:56.300> explosive<00:00:56.780> as<00:00:57.110> what<00:00:57.320> a<00:00:57.350> full-on

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220 
it's not as explosive as what a full-on

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.240 
it's not as explosive as what a full-on
motocross<00:00:59.000> model<00:00:59.450> would<00:00:59.570> be<00:00:59.600> and<00:01:00.110> so<00:01:00.710> it's<00:01:01.010> a

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
motocross model would be and so it's a

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.860 
motocross model would be and so it's a
little<00:01:01.910> easier<00:01:02.239> maintenance<00:01:02.390> a<00:01:02.720> little

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
little easier maintenance a little

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.329 
little easier maintenance a little
easier<00:01:03.110> to<00:01:03.200> ride<00:01:03.350> a<00:01:03.380> little<00:01:03.710> easier<00:01:04.070> to<00:01:04.189> live

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
easier to ride a little easier to live

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.090 
easier to ride a little easier to live

there's<00:01:22.700> a<00:01:22.759> lot<00:01:22.789> of<00:01:22.999> modifications<00:01:23.630> you<00:01:23.719> can

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
there's a lot of modifications you can

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.989 
there's a lot of modifications you can
do<00:01:23.929> that<00:01:24.049> are<00:01:24.170> really<00:01:24.259> simple<00:01:24.770> and<00:01:24.889> easy<00:01:25.039> it

00:01:25.989 --> 00:01:25.999 
do that are really simple and easy it

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:28.480

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.289 
comes with a smog device and spark
arrestor<00:01:28.939> and<00:01:29.090> the<00:01:29.149> exhaust<00:01:29.539> and<00:01:30.079> the<00:01:30.969> air<00:01:31.969> box

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
arrestor and the exhaust and the air box

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:33.940 
arrestor and the exhaust and the air box
is<00:01:32.509> pretty<00:01:32.689> small<00:01:33.049> everything<00:01:33.560> so<00:01:33.709> what<00:01:33.829> you

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
is pretty small everything so what you

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.529 
is pretty small everything so what you
could<00:01:34.069> do<00:01:34.219> is<00:01:34.429> you<00:01:34.639> know<00:01:34.670> you<00:01:34.789> could<00:01:35.030> eliminate

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
could do is you know you could eliminate

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:37.179 
could do is you know you could eliminate
a<00:01:35.810> couple<00:01:36.109> of<00:01:36.229> things<00:01:36.469> take<00:01:36.740> them<00:01:36.859> off<00:01:36.950> and<00:01:36.979> put

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
a couple of things take them off and put

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:39.519 
a couple of things take them off and put
some<00:01:37.399> plugs<00:01:37.609> in<00:01:37.850> them<00:01:37.969> and<00:01:38.209> then<00:01:38.929> also<00:01:39.139> you<00:01:39.350> can

00:01:39.519 --> 00:01:39.529 
some plugs in them and then also you can

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:40.989 
some plugs in them and then also you can
change<00:01:39.679> the<00:01:39.889> exhaust<00:01:40.189> and<00:01:40.429> take<00:01:40.579> the<00:01:40.729> spark

00:01:40.989 --> 00:01:40.999 
change the exhaust and take the spark

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:42.760 
change the exhaust and take the spark
arrestor<00:01:41.359> in<00:01:41.450> a<00:01:41.509> small<00:01:41.749> quiet<00:01:41.990> Bop<00:01:42.289> exhaust

pro circuit that kind of stuff
that's<00:01:50.840> really<00:01:51.049> good<00:01:51.319> then<00:01:51.529> other<00:01:51.709> things

00:01:52.059 --> 00:01:52.069 
that's really good then other things

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:53.679 
that's really good then other things
that<00:01:52.340> you<00:01:52.459> can<00:01:52.609> do<00:01:52.729> is<00:01:52.909> you<00:01:53.179> can<00:01:53.270> open<00:01:53.509> up<00:01:53.569> the

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
that you can do is you can open up the

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:55.300 
that you can do is you can open up the
air<00:01:53.840> box<00:01:54.079> there's<00:01:54.469> some<00:01:54.619> holes<00:01:54.799> you<00:01:55.069> can<00:01:55.189> put

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
air box there's some holes you can put

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.639 
air box there's some holes you can put
in<00:01:55.399> behind<00:01:55.520> some<00:01:55.969> of<00:01:56.060> the<00:01:56.149> places<00:01:56.359> and<00:01:56.929> cut

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
in behind some of the places and cut

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:59.589 
in behind some of the places and cut
some<00:01:57.770> top<00:01:58.039> out<00:01:58.340> of<00:01:58.459> the<00:01:58.579> the<00:01:58.969> air<00:01:59.090> box<00:01:59.299> let<00:01:59.509> it

00:01:59.589 --> 00:01:59.599 
some top out of the the air box let it

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:00.969 
some top out of the the air box let it
breathe<00:01:59.749> a<00:01:59.810> little<00:01:59.959> better

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
breathe a little better

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:02.859 
breathe a little better
and<00:02:01.640> when<00:02:01.759> you<00:02:01.850> do<00:02:01.969> that<00:02:02.180> then<00:02:02.539> you<00:02:02.659> have<00:02:02.689> to

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
and when you do that then you have to

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.770 
and when you do that then you have to
change<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.289> jetting<00:02:03.649> in<00:02:03.770> the<00:02:03.860> needle<00:02:04.189> and<00:02:04.780> you

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
change the jetting in the needle and you

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.450 
change the jetting in the needle and you
can<00:02:05.899> go<00:02:06.049> figure<00:02:06.350> on<00:02:06.469> a<00:02:06.500> pilot<00:02:06.770> jet<00:02:07.039> bigger<00:02:07.340> on

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
can go figure on a pilot jet bigger on

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.009 
can go figure on a pilot jet bigger on
the<00:02:07.549> main<00:02:07.729> jet<00:02:08.000> and<00:02:08.269> change<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:08.599> needle<00:02:08.780> size

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019 
the main jet and change the needle size

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:11.229 
the main jet and change the needle size
and<00:02:09.410> that<00:02:10.220> really<00:02:10.399> makes<00:02:10.610> them<00:02:10.700> accelerate

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
and that really makes them accelerate

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.600 
and that really makes them accelerate
more<00:02:11.480> like<00:02:11.660> the<00:02:11.810> race<00:02:12.050> bikes<00:02:12.349> and<00:02:12.709> you<00:02:13.459> come

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
more like the race bikes and you come

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
and be competitive with some of the

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.690 
and be competitive with some of the
full-blown<00:02:16.940> motocross<00:02:17.690> bikes<00:02:18.430> well<00:02:19.430> if<00:02:19.580> it

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
full-blown motocross bikes well if it

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.610 
full-blown motocross bikes well if it
came<00:02:19.819> with<00:02:19.880> a<00:02:20.060> license<00:02:20.540> plate<00:02:20.599> and<00:02:21.019> and<00:02:21.349> turn

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
came with a license plate and and turn

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.020 
came with a license plate and and turn
indicators<00:02:22.099> it<00:02:22.220> would<00:02:22.340> be<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:22.550> world's<00:02:22.880> best

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
indicators it would be the world's best

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.569 
indicators it would be the world's best
bike
