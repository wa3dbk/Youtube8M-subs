00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.260 
a couple plummets in his cyborg baby he
brought<00:03:50.140> in<00:03:50.320> but<00:03:50.620> not<00:03:51.280> not<00:03:51.670> flushed<00:03:52.060> with<00:03:52.180> the

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
brought in but not not flushed with the

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.300 
brought in but not not flushed with the
answer<00:03:52.480> is<00:03:52.540> B<00:03:52.690> is<00:03:52.840> greater<00:03:52.870> than<00:03:53.470> zero<00:03:53.770> he's

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
answer is B is greater than zero he's

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:02.270 
answer is B is greater than zero he's
definitely<00:03:54.700> alive<00:03:56.730> he's<00:03:57.730> gonna<00:03:57.880> consider

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.270 

Oh<00:04:02.340> piece<00:04:03.560> he's<00:04:04.560> thinking<00:04:04.709> about<00:04:04.890> it<00:04:05.100> I<00:04:05.160> guess

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
Oh piece he's thinking about it I guess

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.300 
Oh piece he's thinking about it I guess
he<00:04:05.400> could<00:04:05.700> also<00:04:05.870> activate<00:04:06.870> mutavault<00:04:07.310> so

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
he could also activate mutavault so

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.440 
he could also activate mutavault so
there<00:04:08.730> are<00:04:10.250> some<00:04:11.250> block<00:04:11.490> opportunities<00:04:12.270> that

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
there are some block opportunities that

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.360 
there are some block opportunities that
let<00:04:12.569> him<00:04:12.690> keep<00:04:12.870> full<00:04:13.080> acronis<00:04:13.500> I<00:04:13.740> think<00:04:14.280> he's

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
let him keep full acronis I think he's

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.580 
let him keep full acronis I think he's
basically<00:04:14.700> considering<00:04:15.270> is<00:04:16.169> there<00:04:16.380> some<00:04:16.560> way

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
basically considering is there some way

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.080 
basically considering is there some way
that<00:04:16.739> having<00:04:17.130> a<00:04:17.190> bull<00:04:17.310> acronis<00:04:17.609> in<00:04:17.730> play<00:04:17.880> let's

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
that having a bull acronis in play let's

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.240 
that having a bull acronis in play let's
me<00:04:18.329> steal<00:04:18.900> the<00:04:18.930> initiative<00:04:19.440> somehow<00:04:19.739> well<00:04:20.130> the

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
me steal the initiative somehow well the

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.890 
me steal the initiative somehow well the
thing<00:04:20.459> the<00:04:20.700> thing<00:04:20.730> is<00:04:21.000> that<00:04:21.150> this<00:04:21.510> palette

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
thing the thing is that this palette

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.090 
thing the thing is that this palette
Chronos<00:04:22.230> oddly<00:04:22.530> enough<00:04:22.710> doesn't<00:04:22.889> really

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
Chronos oddly enough doesn't really

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.700 
Chronos oddly enough doesn't really
change<00:04:23.160> Evans<00:04:23.850> clock<00:04:24.120> because<00:04:24.480> he's<00:04:25.110> in<00:04:25.380> I

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
change Evans clock because he's in I

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.129 
change Evans clock because he's in I
kill<00:04:26.340> you<00:04:26.460> if<00:04:26.550> I<00:04:26.639> hate<00:04:26.820> you<00:04:26.940> so<00:04:27.510> Peter<00:04:27.960> might

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:28.139 
kill you if I hate you so Peter might

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:29.570 
kill you if I hate you so Peter might
just<00:04:28.380> say<00:04:28.470> to<00:04:28.530> himself<00:04:28.680> I<00:04:28.889> can<00:04:29.040> afford<00:04:29.310> to<00:04:29.460> take

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
just say to himself I can afford to take

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.950 
just say to himself I can afford to take
this<00:04:29.760> five<00:04:30.060> because<00:04:30.510> it<00:04:30.660> doesn't<00:04:30.870> actually

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
this five because it doesn't actually

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.810 
this five because it doesn't actually

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.050 

Peter<00:04:48.660> draws<00:04:49.020> us<00:04:49.200> part<00:04:49.410> slowly<00:04:49.919> did<00:04:50.760> not<00:04:50.910> look

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
Peter draws us part slowly did not look

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:57.040 
Peter draws us part slowly did not look
like<00:04:51.300> a<00:04:52.130> removal<00:04:53.130> spell

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.600 

I<00:04:57.199> think<00:04:57.710> Peter<00:04:57.830> sees<00:04:58.129> the<00:04:58.250> writing<00:04:58.340> on<00:04:58.550> the

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
I think Peter sees the writing on the

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.760 
I think Peter sees the writing on the
wall<00:04:58.699> here<00:04:59.030> yeah<00:04:59.569> he's<00:05:00.199> gonna<00:05:00.319> have<00:05:00.500> something

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
wall here yeah he's gonna have something

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:06.070 
wall here yeah he's gonna have something
really<00:05:01.159> really<00:05:01.430> good<00:05:01.669> this<00:05:01.789> turn<00:05:04.900> Tom<00:05:05.900> Murray

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
really really good this turn Tom Murray

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.850 
really really good this turn Tom Murray
maybe<00:05:06.699> it<00:05:07.699> is<00:05:08.330> okay<00:05:08.990> and<00:05:09.199> that<00:05:09.289> is<00:05:09.530> an<00:05:09.710> answer

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
maybe it is okay and that is an answer

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.119 
maybe it is okay and that is an answer
to<00:05:10.220> store<00:05:10.520> breath<00:05:10.729> and<00:05:11.180> that's<00:05:11.509> actually<00:05:11.599> a

00:05:12.119 --> 00:05:12.129 
to store breath and that's actually a

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:14.379 
to store breath and that's actually a
very<00:05:13.129> valid<00:05:13.430> reason<00:05:13.789> for<00:05:13.819> keeping<00:05:14.000> that<00:05:14.180> bull

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:14.389 
very valid reason for keeping that bull

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:15.909 
very valid reason for keeping that bull
upon<00:05:14.569> us<00:05:14.720> around<00:05:14.840> that<00:05:15.110> nearly<00:05:15.409> doubled<00:05:15.830> his

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
upon us around that nearly doubled his

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:20.140 
upon us around that nearly doubled his
outs<00:05:16.099> this<00:05:16.280> one<00:05:16.490> breath<00:05:17.229> so<00:05:18.229> now<00:05:18.819> Peter<00:05:19.819> uses

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
outs this one breath so now Peter uses

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.300 
outs this one breath so now Peter uses
Dom<00:05:20.449> brain<00:05:20.659> to<00:05:20.780> fight<00:05:20.990> storm<00:05:21.830> brought<00:05:21.949> dragon

with Paula Chronos and that's one piece

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:26.619 
with Paula Chronos and that's one piece
of<00:05:24.979> the<00:05:25.129> puzzle<00:05:25.220> that<00:05:25.639> Peter<00:05:25.849> is<00:05:25.940> has<00:05:26.389> salt

00:05:26.619 --> 00:05:26.629 
of the puzzle that Peter is has salt

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:28.809 
of the puzzle that Peter is has salt
here<00:05:26.870> but<00:05:27.050> there's<00:05:27.740> numerous<00:05:27.979> other<00:05:28.400> problems

00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:28.819 
here but there's numerous other problems
