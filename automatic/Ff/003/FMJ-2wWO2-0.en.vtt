this stuff is a bit more expensive

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.090 
this stuff is a bit more expensive

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
because I'm professional now but when I

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.399 
because I'm professional now but when I
first<00:01:35.369> started<00:01:35.880> everything<00:01:36.780> was<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.079> sort<00:01:37.380> of

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
first started everything was a sort of

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.870 
first started everything was a sort of
cheapest<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.159> could<00:01:38.310> get<00:01:38.430> your<00:01:38.520> hands<00:01:38.729> on

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
cheapest you could get your hands on

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.060 
cheapest you could get your hands on
just<00:01:39.090> so<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.600> can<00:01:39.810> practice<00:01:40.799> with

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
just so that you can practice with

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.389 
just so that you can practice with
basically<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.210> these<00:01:42.990> are<00:01:43.170> see<00:01:43.350> DJ's<00:01:43.740> these

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
basically and these are see DJ's these

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.530 
basically and these are see DJ's these
are<00:01:44.640> vinyl<00:01:45.030> decks<00:01:47.060> and<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.149> think<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.390> best

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
are vinyl decks and I think the best

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.999 
are vinyl decks and I think the best
thing<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.780> do<00:01:49.020> is<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.350> probably<00:01:49.560> go<00:01:49.890> and

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
thing to do is to probably go and

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.819 
thing to do is to probably go and
practice<00:01:50.579> on<00:01:50.899> you<00:01:51.899> know<00:01:52.020> find<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.380> mate<00:01:52.590> who's
