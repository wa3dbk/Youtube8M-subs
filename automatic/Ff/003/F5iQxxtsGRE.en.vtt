00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:27.699 
actually make us live longer before we

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:30.120 
actually make us live longer before we

we chlorinate our water supply to kill
off<00:02:40.780> any<00:02:41.080> bacteria<00:02:41.550> so<00:02:42.550> we<00:02:43.450> don't<00:02:43.720> get<00:02:43.870> a<00:02:43.930> lot

of b12 in our water anymore we don't get

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.110 
of b12 in our water anymore we don't get

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
a lot of cholera either so that's a good

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.630
