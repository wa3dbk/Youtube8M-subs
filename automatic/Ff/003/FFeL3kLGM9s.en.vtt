00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:06.720
 strange hdblog selector 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.820
 qualcomm has a vision of op fa in 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.769
 five a product that will not arrive on 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.170
 Italian market but that is considerable 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.000
 very interesting for a number of 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.820
 first of all features a nice display 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.820
 5 inch full hd that allows us to 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.730
 appreciate the very good quality of the 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.039
 chromatic range expressed by this 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.200
 panel and above all also the corner of 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.510
 very high view 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.150
 a little while ago, of course, being 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.620
 on the stage stand offers the 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.950
 snapdragon s4 solution 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.590
 let's say the model closest to the 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.080
 hesperia z we've seen so far 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:47.080
 both in size and structure 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:50.680
 general and very squared aesthetics 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.830
 very simple and with a camera 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:57.040
 3 megapixel rear 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:59.800
 a little ago in five and mounts android is one 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.230
 customized version with a series of 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.680
 particular options for the division into 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:09.479
 tab of our device within the 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:13.119
 system we find obviously android 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.759
 4.1.1 a giga hertz point 5 the cocktail 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:18.280
 2 gigabytes is the ram inside 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:21.040
 of the interface we have some widgets 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:25.090
 very pleasant and a little details 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:28.750
 originals with this view in 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.729
 let's call that kind of balloon 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.580
 so where do we have the watch on 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.990
 calendar is a contact manager 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.479
 where you can add any 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.950
 contacts currently absent in the 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.190
 settings and especially the division 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:45.209
 a tab seems a bit from China to tab 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.890
 is one of the macro elements that 

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:50.289
 distinguishes she we saw it on 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.179
 away we saw it on the various 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:55.420
 we saw it then on my wii 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:57.640
 at the beginning of its existence 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.890
 lots of options to customize 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.830
 then the device in fact we have then 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.869
 inside the power it is instead 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.970
 separated from the translated applications 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.440
 home where we have the widget while 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.860
 the dwelling is actually in the 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.780
 program 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.010
 of the applications we have the 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.160
 possibility to manage all 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.440
 google applications and tools 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.930
 sorry we also find the torch e 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.470
 quickoffice compass is a recorder 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:27.500
 audio the ability to make notes 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.960
 through the interface a little lg style 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.050
 as for the known icons that 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.940
 can be managed through the 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.680
 keyboard you can't draw a 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:42.260
 what we are seeing right now 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:44.920
 maybe so ok here it is possible 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.270
 obviously delete the note e 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.750
 modify any sections, etc. 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.420
 etc 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:54.660
 there is also the possibility of 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.730
 manage the photos taken with a good one 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.410
 speed loading previews 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.200
 and once done it is enough 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.970
 nice the camera offers 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.019
 we eat an interface on the side 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.340
 opposite 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.670
 customized with 1080p for 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.040
 video achievements some options for 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:16.249
 geo tagging photo location is the 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:19.730
 possibility to manage the grid the hdr 

00:03:16.249 --> 00:03:21.650
 is present in the photos we also have 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.819
 some options regarding the 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:29.870
 management of the previews of the 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:32.680
 effects we have some effects that were 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.790
 lower dissolution of the face 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.889
 sorry face recognition 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.650
 let's go change possibilities 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:42.139
 solution and to manage any others 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.659
 functionality therefore hdr photo the video 

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:46.699
 now it is a plus that is present a little bit 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:49.159
 all the high-end android range 

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:52.120
 compact tab classic keypad 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:54.949

 nice nice is a device 

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:59.719
 unfortunately quite light 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.370
 anti-shoplifting wastes a little 

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:03.560
 taken to understand how much 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:07.900
 comfortable in hand there seems to still 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:10.810
 very different from xperia ta level of 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:14.489
 volume and thickness not only of the 3d hd 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:18.389
 block does in five and all that remains is to say 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.389
