00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
what made me think of that is because I

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.379 
what made me think of that is because I
was<00:00:13.920> trying<00:00:14.190> something<00:00:14.400> completely<00:00:15.179> new

was trying something completely new

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
today and it's Peroni Mastro as you a

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.439 
today and it's Peroni Mastro as you a
row<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.800> I<00:00:22.800> can't<00:00:23.609> remember<00:00:23.880> ever<00:00:24.060> having<00:00:24.240> an

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
row and I can't remember ever having an

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.179 
row and I can't remember ever having an
Italian<00:00:24.869> beer<00:00:25.050> before<00:00:25.380> it's<00:00:25.529> an<00:00:25.590> Italian<00:00:25.980> beer

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
because I thought that was a little bit

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:42.780

the<00:04:52.750> closest<00:04:53.140> thing<00:04:53.290> that<00:04:53.500> I<00:04:53.530> could<00:04:53.770> think<00:04:53.920> of

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
the closest thing that I could think of

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.920 
the closest thing that I could think of
would<00:04:54.340> be<00:04:54.400> rolling<00:04:55.030> rock<00:04:55.360> it's<00:04:56.430> it's<00:04:57.430> got<00:04:57.610> no

no no significant flavors it's a very
very<00:05:07.300> very<00:05:07.510> slight<00:05:08.380> like<00:05:09.720> happy<00:05:10.720> barley<00:05:11.110> taste

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
very very slight like happy barley taste

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:17.400 
very very slight like happy barley taste
to<00:05:12.160> it<00:05:12.190> it's<00:05:14.640> but<00:05:15.640> it's<00:05:15.820> really<00:05:16.150> very<00:05:16.510> light

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410

there's<00:05:17.620> not<00:05:17.920> much<00:05:18.160> it's<00:05:18.690> it's<00:05:19.690> the

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
there's not much it's it's the

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.220 
there's not much it's it's the
equivalent<00:05:20.110> of<00:05:20.380> drinking<00:05:20.530> water<00:05:20.920> beer
