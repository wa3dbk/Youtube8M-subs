00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.789
 hello alone for tanzania expert in 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.770
 Neonatal care arrived 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.810
 many questions to my mom's email 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.360
 and able super worried about their 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.430
 buds I chose the most frequent of 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.460
 all and I 'll explain them and the 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.730
 First , because they leave stains 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.590
 the almost merits very good question 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.780
 it can be for several things one of the 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.260
 very common things is sun spots 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.719
 also for poor diet or a 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.000
 birthmark or that is not 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:46.730
 sleeping in the right areas like 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.500
 can be nurse tania looks to be 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.829
 nurse tania need you 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.120
 boarding the mere grouper of minatitlan 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.430
 because he is the one who has to assign you 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.800
 the nurses also studied 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.739
 neonatal nursing for knowledge 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.260
 of the neonatal species how many babies there are 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.750
 by stage now they did surprise me with 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.880
 that question there are many different 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.799
 species of neonates the truth is not 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.979
 we have the exact data of how many there are 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:15.040
 Look, it's more, I do not know at Atitlan 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.080
 there are probably thousands 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.240
 what are the first things that 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.490
 I need for my baby when I just 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.350
 adopted to start what you need is 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.330
 a serum and it depends on the stage of 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.580
 maturation is the time that you leave it 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.010
 then for the feeding you need 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.590
 milk and porridge and in terms of hygiene 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.780
 a careful bathroom kit do not go to 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.150
 submerge because you can get sick or 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.340
 less is an almost merit and for the 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.500
 mobility we recommend the gym 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.600
 which is great for them to develop their 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.510
 motor and net bambi so that what 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.600
 take a walk everywhere and of course what 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.130
 more useful for a mom is the diaper 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.100
 how to know when your kids are 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.460
 sick very easy to be in the middle 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.990
 PaliDocs are a little bit sad 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.110
 discouraged do not want to eat and with the 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.420
 extremely high temperature that can be 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.180
 die your blossoms the other two do not 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.850
 die two super deep dreams come in 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.050
 and that is why sadness apapacharlo 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.330
 forever 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.670
 what happens if I do not vaccinate my unborn child 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.920
 it is very important that the vaccine because 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.650
 if it can not be weakened and they are lowered 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.110
 the defenses what happens to the neonates 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.850
 if you give them food it is not recommended 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.080
 because they may not absorb the 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.030
 necessary nutrients 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.780
 that's why 'destroyer' has its pap 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.780
 special 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.750

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.610
