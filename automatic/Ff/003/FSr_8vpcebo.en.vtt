00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.720
 in you 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.290
 the system to make their carts 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:10.290
 of wood with these facts and that 's it 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.290
 assembly 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:17.830
 your supports for the address is 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.470
 formed to the axes 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.250
 basic support of petter accident 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:26.220
 prick 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:31.130
 the thesis 33 42 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.130
 bridges on the third bridge nothing else 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.610
 we can see in the race is in our 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:38.420
 position 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.170
 with my plane 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.530
 and wishes 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.690
 as never if you can really keep 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:50.030
 the horizontal although the tires are 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:53.870
 crooked and now we see as low 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:58.270
 as he continues to maintain that duty 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.270
 system that all trucks 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.450
 it can work for us to be 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.550
 still 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.550
 ah 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.740
 fine-tune many details as if more than the 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.820
 half more perfect but 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.190
 I do not think 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:35.670
 in regards 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.670
 it's very good in the horizontal 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.020
 same here backwards forward putting the 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.810
 height always keeping the forward 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.710
 the islands continue to keep serving 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.580
 this axis 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.580
 the shape 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.980
 4 we put the contraitos the cortitos 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.440
 but it's okay 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.830
 we can see more the expansion of what 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.830
 pass 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:09.700
 get back here but it's much more 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:11.650
 hard you may have the rigidity and 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.930
 the shape of the stars 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.180
 well, everyone 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.689
 then when I finish doing it 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.689
 completely
