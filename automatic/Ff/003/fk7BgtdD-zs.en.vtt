gets<00:02:58.820> thickened<00:02:59.240> up<00:02:59.330> and<00:02:59.510> I<00:02:59.570> can<00:02:59.720> use<00:02:59.870> that<00:02:59.900> to

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
gets thickened up and I can use that to

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.280 
gets thickened up and I can use that to
pour<00:03:00.560> over<00:03:00.790> to<00:03:01.790> make<00:03:01.910> it<00:03:02.000> nice<00:03:02.150> and<00:03:02.180> saucy<00:03:02.540> so

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
I'm going to let this reduce down

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.740 
I'm going to let this reduce down
thicken<00:03:04.760> up<00:03:04.850> and<00:03:05.060> I'll<00:03:05.120> be<00:03:05.210> back<00:03:07.510> alright<00:03:08.510> so
