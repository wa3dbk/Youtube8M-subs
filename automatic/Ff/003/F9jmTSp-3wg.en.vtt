00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.590 
you guys good or the best trick shotting
spots<00:00:23.250> on<00:00:23.490> three<00:00:23.880> maps<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.240> three<00:00:24.420> masts<00:00:24.570> are

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
spots on three maps the three masts are

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.970 
spots on three maps the three masts are
going<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:24.869> be<00:00:24.960> standoff<00:00:25.500> raid<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.930> probably

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
going to be standoff raid and probably

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.089 
going to be standoff raid and probably
another<00:00:28.980> map<00:00:29.220> carrier<00:00:30.410> alright<00:00:31.410> so<00:00:31.619> there<00:00:31.980> are

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
another map carrier alright so there are

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.010 
another map carrier alright so there are
three<00:00:32.430> spots<00:00:32.790> on<00:00:32.969> standoff<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:33.480> people<00:00:33.899> do<00:00:33.989> a

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
three spots on standoff that people do a

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.229 
three spots on standoff that people do a
lot<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.320> trickshotting<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.340> spots<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.120> i

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
lot of trickshotting and spots that i

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.630 
lot of trickshotting and spots that i
personally<00:00:36.480> use<00:00:36.809> will<00:00:37.590> be<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.920> latter<00:00:38.160> shot

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
personally use will be the latter shot

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.430 
personally use will be the latter shot
well<00:00:38.910> there's<00:00:39.090> i<00:00:39.210> guess<00:00:39.510> there's<00:00:39.750> four<00:00:40.079> spots

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
well there's i guess there's four spots

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.200 
well there's i guess there's four spots
so<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.770> first<00:00:41.160> one<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.700> ladder<00:00:41.910> stall

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
so the first one is the ladder stall

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.610 
so the first one is the ladder stall
spot<00:00:42.480> it's<00:00:42.690> basically<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.110> can<00:00:43.230> jump<00:00:43.410> from

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
spot it's basically you can jump from

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.799 
spot it's basically you can jump from
here<00:00:43.649> do<00:00:44.430> anything<00:00:44.879> hit<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.210> ladder<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.570> do

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
here do anything hit the ladder and do

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.240 
here do anything hit the ladder and do
spend<00:00:46.110> I'm<00:00:46.260> not<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.440> trick<00:00:46.680> shot<00:00:46.860> I'm<00:00:46.980> mostly

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.610 
spend I'm not a trick shot I'm mostly

place for trick shots is honestly right

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.390 
place for trick shots is honestly right
beside<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.030> latter<00:01:03.239> spa<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:04.170> is<00:01:04.409> the

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
beside the latter spa and it is the

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.010 
beside the latter spa and it is the
window<00:01:05.670> standoff<00:01:06.479> window<00:01:06.720> shot<00:01:06.900> it's

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
window standoff window shot it's

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.420 
window standoff window shot it's
probably<00:01:07.229> one<00:01:07.350> of<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.500> dirtiest<00:01:07.920> shots<00:01:08.220> to

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
probably one of the dirtiest shots to

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.670 
probably one of the dirtiest shots to
hit<00:01:08.460> probably<00:01:09.299> one<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.510> best<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:10.020> see<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.560> lot

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
hit probably one of the best I see a lot

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.179 
hit probably one of the best I see a lot
of<00:01:10.740> people<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.700> bc<00:01:12.210> i<00:01:12.659> see<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.960> lot<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.170> pros<00:01:13.710> or

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
of people you bc i see a lot of pros or

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.830 
of people you bc i see a lot of pros or
phase<00:01:14.670> members<00:01:15.030> doing<00:01:15.210> this<00:01:15.390> shot<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.750> all

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
phase members doing this shot and all

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.469 
phase members doing this shot and all
the<00:01:15.960> randoms<00:01:16.350> very<00:01:16.890> very<00:01:17.159> hard<00:01:17.340> shot<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.150> hit

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
the randoms very very hard shot to hit

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.450 
the randoms very very hard shot to hit
so<00:01:19.229> basically<00:01:19.590> what<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:19.770> got<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:19.950> do<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.040> jump

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
so basically what you got to do is jump

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.649 
so basically what you got to do is jump
out<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.759> window<00:01:20.790> something<00:01:21.360> i'm<00:01:21.479> going<00:01:21.600> to

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
out the window something i'm going to

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.960 
out the window something i'm going to
try<00:01:21.780> not<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.200> jump<00:01:22.439> out<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:23.520> jump<00:01:23.759> out<00:01:23.850> the

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
try not to jump out it you jump out the

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.429 
try not to jump out it you jump out the
window<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.330> then<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.540> know<00:01:24.689> scope<00:01:24.990> through

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
window and then you know scope through

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.929 
window and then you know scope through
there<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.920> try<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.220> hit<00:01:26.310> somebody<00:01:26.490> on<00:01:26.759> the

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
there and try and hit somebody on the

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.460 
there and try and hit somebody on the
street<00:01:27.180> again<00:01:27.420> it's<00:01:27.720> one<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.170> harder

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
street again it's one of the harder

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.200 
street again it's one of the harder
shots<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.920> hit<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:31.579> okay<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:32.640> i'm<00:01:32.880> not<00:01:33.030> the

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
shots to hit and okay so i'm not the

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.760 
shots to hit and okay so i'm not the
best<00:01:33.329> trickshot<00:01:33.659> ER<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.110> then<00:01:34.290> this<00:01:34.470> just

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
best trickshot ER and then this just

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.440 
best trickshot ER and then this just
won't<00:01:35.070> work<00:01:35.189> out<00:01:35.520> from<00:01:35.820> za<00:01:36.000> we're<00:01:36.210> just<00:01:36.360> gonna

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
won't work out from za we're just gonna

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.530 
won't work out from za we're just gonna
move<00:01:36.630> on<00:01:37.610> alright<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.820> next<00:01:38.850> shot<00:01:39.299> that

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
move on alright so the next shot that

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.719 
move on alright so the next shot that
you<00:01:39.659> can<00:01:39.810> hit<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:40.110> like<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:41.070> tanks<00:01:41.520> shot

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
you can hit is like a the tanks shot

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.760 
you can hit is like a the tanks shot
this<00:01:41.909> tank<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.420> better<00:01:42.780> tank<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.530> stand

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
this tank is the better tank to stand

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.350 
this tank is the better tank to stand
because<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.040> have<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.280> little<00:01:44.579> lift<00:01:44.850> here<00:01:45.180> and

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
because you have a little lift here and

you have clear view of this street that

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.230 
you have clear view of this street that

there again trickshotting the fourth

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.550 
there again trickshotting the fourth
spot<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.420> can<00:02:00.570> hit<00:02:00.659> on<00:02:00.810> standoff<00:02:01.229> is<00:02:01.380> the

spot you can hit on standoff is the

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.039 
spot you can hit on standoff is the
greenhouse<00:02:02.130> windows<00:02:02.549> book<00:02:02.820> shot<00:02:03.240> it's<00:02:03.540> again

greenhouse windows book shot it's again
another<00:02:04.229> window<00:02:04.560> shot<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:05.009> little<00:02:05.159> bit<00:02:05.369> easier

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
another window shot a little bit easier

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.469 
another window shot a little bit easier
to<00:02:05.729> hit<00:02:05.880> but<00:02:06.630> not<00:02:07.350> as<00:02:07.740> complicated<00:02:08.700> as<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.300> one

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
to hit but not as complicated as the one

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.839 
to hit but not as complicated as the one
that's<00:02:09.750> just<00:02:10.050> over<00:02:10.259> there<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.520> final

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
that's just over there and the final

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.580 
that's just over there and the final
spot<00:02:11.970> that<00:02:12.300> I<00:02:12.510> know<00:02:12.569> of<00:02:12.750> on<00:02:13.140> the

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
spot that I know of on the

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.650 
spot that I know of on the
map<00:02:13.769> for<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:14.459> good<00:02:14.700> trick<00:02:14.910> shotting<00:02:15.120> SWA<00:02:15.390> it's

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
map for a good trick shotting SWA it's

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.990 
map for a good trick shotting SWA it's
just<00:02:15.930> up<00:02:16.080> here<00:02:16.110> you<00:02:16.470> get<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.709> extra<00:02:17.310> elevated

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
just up here you get the extra elevated

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.550 
just up here you get the extra elevated
boost<00:02:18.269> and<00:02:18.599> probably<00:02:19.140> one<00:02:19.290> of<00:02:19.319> the<00:02:19.440> best

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
boost and probably one of the best

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.800 
boost and probably one of the best
things<00:02:19.680> you<00:02:19.950> could<00:02:20.069> do<00:02:20.160> is<00:02:20.280> just<00:02:20.489> you<00:02:20.700> know<00:02:20.879> try

things you could do is just you know try

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.750 
things you could do is just you know try
and<00:02:21.900> hit<00:02:22.019> somebody<00:02:22.260> that's<00:02:22.620> in<00:02:22.920> this<00:02:23.430> general

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
and hit somebody that's in this general

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.420 
and hit somebody that's in this general
direction<00:02:23.970> or<00:02:24.870> over<00:02:25.170> there<00:02:25.379> yeah<00:02:26.040> so<00:02:26.280> those

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
direction or over there yeah so those

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.869 
direction or over there yeah so those
are<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.610> four<00:02:26.730> or<00:02:27.300> five<00:02:27.480> main<00:02:27.900> um<00:02:28.879> sure

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
are the four or five main um sure

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
shutting spots on the map standoff let's

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.250 
shutting spots on the map standoff let's
uh<00:02:31.980> let's<00:02:32.099> go<00:02:32.370> on<00:02:32.489> a<00:02:32.580> raid<00:02:32.900> alright<00:02:33.900> so<00:02:34.080> there

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
got to break the windows so you don't

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.660 
got to break the windows so you don't
run<00:02:50.970> into<00:02:51.209> them<00:02:51.540> first<00:02:51.890> the<00:02:52.890> one<00:02:53.040> spot<00:02:53.310> that<00:02:53.370> my

run into them first the one spot that my

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.160 
run into them first the one spot that my
friend<00:02:53.970> likes<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.239> trickshot<00:02:54.450> is<00:02:54.750> from<00:02:54.989> this

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
friend likes to trickshot is from this

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.990 
friend likes to trickshot is from this
angle<00:02:55.410> you<00:02:55.709> can<00:02:55.829> honestly<00:02:56.010> come<00:02:56.400> from<00:02:56.579> here

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
angle you can honestly come from here

angle you can honestly come from here
here<00:02:58.340> here<00:02:59.340> or<00:02:59.629> you<00:03:00.629> can<00:03:00.780> even<00:03:00.900> jump<00:03:01.260> out<00:03:01.410> this

here here or you can even jump out this
window<00:03:01.650> this<00:03:02.250> would<00:03:02.400> be<00:03:02.489> the<00:03:02.579> window<00:03:02.879> shot<00:03:03.150> it

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
window this would be the window shot it

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.110 
window this would be the window shot it
try<00:03:04.500> it's<00:03:05.310> probably<00:03:05.610> one<00:03:05.730> of<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.879> harder

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
try it's probably one of the harder

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.979 
try it's probably one of the harder
shots<00:03:06.299> to<00:03:06.569> hit<00:03:06.599> every<00:03:07.230> shot<00:03:07.549> on<00:03:08.549> this<00:03:08.730> map<00:03:08.940> is

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
shots to hit every shot on this map is

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.900 
shots to hit every shot on this map is
pretty<00:03:09.989> hard<00:03:10.170> to<00:03:10.230> hit<00:03:10.410> you<00:03:10.590> know<00:03:10.739> I<00:03:10.950> didn't

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
pretty hard to hit you know I didn't

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.720 
pretty hard to hit you know I didn't
even<00:03:12.060> jump<00:03:12.239> off<00:03:12.450> all<00:03:12.660> right<00:03:12.780> to<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:12.959> next<00:03:13.200> spot

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.670 
even jump off all right to the next spot
alright<00:03:14.730> so<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.390> second<00:03:15.780> spot<00:03:16.019> on<00:03:16.079> this<00:03:16.470> map

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
alright so the second spot on this map

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.170 
alright so the second spot on this map
it<00:03:16.920> is<00:03:17.040> not<00:03:17.220> a<00:03:17.250> suicide<00:03:17.519> so<00:03:17.910> it's<00:03:18.030> probably

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
it is not a suicide so it's probably

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.690 
it is not a suicide so it's probably
easier<00:03:18.510> to<00:03:18.630> hit<00:03:18.720> it<00:03:18.870> easier<00:03:19.350> to<00:03:19.440> go<00:03:19.590> for<00:03:19.889> it<00:03:20.069> is

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
easier to hit it easier to go for it is

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.720 
easier to hit it easier to go for it is
on<00:03:20.910> statue<00:03:21.450> or<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:22.019> middle<00:03:22.260> statue<00:03:22.500> on<00:03:22.920> the

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
on statue or the middle statue on the

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.699 
on statue or the middle statue on the
right<00:03:23.910> side<00:03:24.209> of<00:03:24.359> the<00:03:24.389> map<00:03:24.660> or<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.170> left<00:03:25.380> really

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
right side of the map or the left really

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.590 
right side of the map or the left really
depending<00:03:26.130> on<00:03:26.220> how<00:03:26.340> you're<00:03:26.489> looking<00:03:26.700> at<00:03:26.850> it<00:03:27.000> a

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
depending on how you're looking at it a

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.879 
depending on how you're looking at it a
lot<00:03:27.930> of<00:03:28.049> people<00:03:28.260> come<00:03:28.350> and<00:03:28.410> trick<00:03:28.620> shot<00:03:28.769> here

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
lot of people come and trick shot here

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:30.170 
lot of people come and trick shot here
there's<00:03:29.099> probably<00:03:29.400> a<00:03:29.609> little<00:03:29.730> bit<00:03:29.910> less

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
there's probably a little bit less

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.610 
there's probably a little bit less
things<00:03:30.420> you<00:03:30.510> could<00:03:30.630> do<00:03:30.750> since<00:03:31.019> it's<00:03:31.170> not<00:03:31.380> got

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
things you could do since it's not got

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.289 
things you could do since it's not got
that<00:03:31.739> extra<00:03:31.980> elevation<00:03:32.609> but<00:03:32.790> yeah<00:03:33.030> that<00:03:33.269> is

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
that extra elevation but yeah that is

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:34.789 
that extra elevation but yeah that is
one<00:03:33.660> of<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.870> spots<00:03:34.109> that<00:03:34.260> a<00:03:34.380> lot<00:03:34.590> of<00:03:34.680> people

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
one of the spots that a lot of people

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.099 
one of the spots that a lot of people
trick<00:03:35.099> shot<00:03:35.280> from<00:03:35.459> alright<00:03:36.090> so<00:03:36.299> for<00:03:36.480> the<00:03:36.599> final

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
trick shot from alright so for the final

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:39.650 
trick shot from alright so for the final
shot<00:03:37.380> one<00:03:37.739> of<00:03:37.769> the<00:03:37.920> hardest<00:03:38.459> shots<00:03:38.730> and<00:03:39.000> shots

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
shot one of the hardest shots and shots

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.020 
shot one of the hardest shots and shots
that<00:03:39.870> are<00:03:39.930> very<00:03:40.200> very<00:03:40.500> uncommon<00:03:41.010> you<00:03:41.910> may

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
that are very very uncommon you may

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.240 
that are very very uncommon you may
think<00:03:42.090> this<00:03:42.450> window<00:03:42.930> is<00:03:43.169> a<00:03:43.260> good<00:03:43.530> idea<00:03:43.590> but<00:03:44.040> no

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
think this window is a good idea but no

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.699 
think this window is a good idea but no
this<00:03:44.669> window<00:03:45.030> over<00:03:45.299> here<00:03:45.329> I've<00:03:45.989> never<00:03:46.530> seen

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
this window over here I've never seen

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.789 
this window over here I've never seen
somebody<00:03:47.280> hit<00:03:47.519> this<00:03:47.669> shot<00:03:47.970> and<00:03:48.269> it's<00:03:49.169> probably

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
somebody hit this shot and it's probably

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.770 
somebody hit this shot and it's probably
one<00:03:50.370> of<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:50.549> hardest<00:03:50.849> to<00:03:51.060> be<00:03:51.150> honest<00:03:51.510> it's

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
one of the hardest to be honest it's

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.170 
one of the hardest to be honest it's
just<00:03:52.049> I<00:03:52.290> would<00:03:52.919> just<00:03:53.069> be<00:03:53.099> incredible<00:03:53.190> but<00:03:53.790> yes

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
just I would just be incredible but yes

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.390 
just I would just be incredible but yes
this<00:03:54.419> window<00:03:54.720> is<00:03:54.750> also<00:03:55.590> a<00:03:55.620> great<00:03:55.739> spot<00:03:56.099> but

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
this window is also a great spot but

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.039 
this window is also a great spot but
this<00:03:56.579> is<00:03:56.760> one<00:03:57.329> of<00:03:57.359> the<00:03:57.480> better<00:03:57.599> window<00:03:57.900> because

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
this is one of the better window because

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.259 
this is one of the better window because
you<00:03:58.169> can<00:03:58.290> get<00:03:58.440> off<00:03:58.590> and<00:03:58.919> do<00:03:59.040> the<00:03:59.099> suicide<00:03:59.609> which

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
you can get off and do the suicide which

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.089 
you can get off and do the suicide which
makes<00:04:00.480> your<00:04:00.660> trick<00:04:00.810> shot<00:04:01.049> four<00:04:01.680> hundred<00:04:01.980> times

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
makes your trick shot four hundred times

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:03.710 
makes your trick shot four hundred times
better<00:04:02.310> alright<00:04:03.150> so<00:04:03.209> now<00:04:03.329> we're<00:04:03.450> going<00:04:03.540> to<00:04:03.599> be

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
better alright so now we're going to be

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.379 
better alright so now we're going to be
moving<00:04:03.840> on<00:04:04.139> to<00:04:04.560> carrier<00:04:05.099> alright<00:04:06.030> so<00:04:06.269> now

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:06.389 
moving on to carrier alright so now

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:08.030 
moving on to carrier alright so now
we're<00:04:06.540> on<00:04:06.630> carrier<00:04:07.139> there's<00:04:07.440> probably<00:04:07.799> two<00:04:08.010> or

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
we're on carrier there's probably two or

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.610 
we're on carrier there's probably two or
three<00:04:08.220> spots<00:04:08.760> on<00:04:09.030> this<00:04:09.329> map<00:04:09.510> as<00:04:09.750> well<00:04:10.109> and<00:04:10.470> i'll

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
three spots on this map as well and i'll

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.229 
three spots on this map as well and i'll
probably<00:04:10.829> go<00:04:11.069> over<00:04:11.099> most<00:04:11.579> of<00:04:11.730> them<00:04:11.880> this<00:04:12.060> map

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
probably go over most of them this map

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.360 
probably go over most of them this map
is<00:04:12.540> has<00:04:13.049> just<00:04:13.410> probably<00:04:13.620> the<00:04:13.829> best<00:04:13.980> map<00:04:14.160> for

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
is has just probably the best map for

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.110 
is has just probably the best map for
suicides<00:04:14.819> now<00:04:15.750> this<00:04:16.200> spot<00:04:16.530> is<00:04:16.829> a<00:04:17.340> little<00:04:18.030> bit

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
suicides now this spot is a little bit

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.460 
suicides now this spot is a little bit
harder<00:04:18.479> to<00:04:18.510> hit<00:04:18.690> a<00:04:18.750> trick<00:04:18.989> shot<00:04:19.139> because<00:04:19.289> you

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
harder to hit a trick shot because you

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:20.960 
harder to hit a trick shot because you
don't<00:04:19.620> have<00:04:19.680> that<00:04:19.889> extra<00:04:20.160> elevation<00:04:20.789> that<00:04:20.940> a

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
don't have that extra elevation that a

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.089 
don't have that extra elevation that a
lot<00:04:21.180> of<00:04:21.269> the<00:04:21.329> spots<00:04:21.599> you<00:04:21.690> do<00:04:21.840> on<00:04:22.079> the<00:04:22.590> suicides

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:23.099 
lot of the spots you do on the suicides

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:25.100 
lot of the spots you do on the suicides
but<00:04:23.669> yeah<00:04:23.880> this<00:04:24.090> is<00:04:24.240> a<00:04:24.270> trick<00:04:24.570> shotting<00:04:24.780> spot

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
but yeah this is a trick shotting spot

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.899 
but yeah this is a trick shotting spot
right<00:04:25.380> here<00:04:25.409> and<00:04:25.950> a<00:04:26.039> lot<00:04:26.190> of<00:04:26.219> people<00:04:26.400> hit<00:04:26.640> cross

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:26.909 
right here and a lot of people hit cross

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:27.200 
right here and a lot of people hit cross
them<00:04:27.060> at

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
them at

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.370 
them at
no<00:04:27.330> scopes<00:04:27.660> that's<00:04:27.930> probably<00:04:28.139> one<00:04:28.259> of<00:04:28.289> the

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
no scopes that's probably one of the

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.650 
no scopes that's probably one of the
best<00:04:28.500> spots<00:04:28.620> for<00:04:28.860> it<00:04:29.100> so<00:04:29.970> this<00:04:30.120> is<00:04:30.150> a<00:04:30.300> suicide

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
best spots for it so this is a suicide

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.390 
best spots for it so this is a suicide
spot<00:04:31.229> on<00:04:31.500> the<00:04:31.680> right<00:04:31.800> side<00:04:32.039> of<00:04:32.069> the<00:04:32.220> map

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
spot on the right side of the map

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.279 
spot on the right side of the map
basically<00:04:33.180> all<00:04:33.210> you<00:04:33.389> do<00:04:33.509> is<00:04:33.690> you<00:04:33.810> just<00:04:33.840> come

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.289 
basically all you do is you just come

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:35.719 
basically all you do is you just come
here<00:04:34.500> you<00:04:34.710> could<00:04:34.860> I<00:04:34.889> think<00:04:35.130> you<00:04:35.250> can<00:04:35.370> stand<00:04:35.610> on

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:35.729 
here you could I think you can stand on

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:37.100 
here you could I think you can stand on
top<00:04:35.910> of<00:04:36.060> this<00:04:36.150> yet<00:04:36.419> you<00:04:36.630> get<00:04:36.750> the<00:04:36.870> extra

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
top of this yet you get the extra

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.990 
top of this yet you get the extra
elevation<00:04:37.530> you<00:04:37.620> just<00:04:37.800> jump<00:04:38.069> off<00:04:38.190> and<00:04:38.520> do

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
elevation you just jump off and do
