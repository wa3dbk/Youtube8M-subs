00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.000
Hey! I often get asked about my running
shoes so I'm gonna unbox my new pair with you.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.280
This is the New Balance Minimus Zero Road Version 2.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.400
Zero drop shoe which means there's a zero mm heel-to-toe difference.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:24.240
This is flat which makes for an easy mid-foot strike, which is great because it keeps the heel out of the way

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.720
Good if you want to get faster, if you want to move from a heel strike to a mid-foot strike.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.520
It's a great shoe for that.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.320
I haven't tried it yet but I knew the previous model and it looks like it's improved on it.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.440
It's even lighter.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.600
It has an asymmetrical design with lace loops on the inside and just holes on the outside.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.280
And the tongue is actually continuous with the inside of the shoe

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.680
and only opens on the outside.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.600
It looks very, very  comfortable inside as well.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.040
I don't see any seam...

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.000
They've upgraded the upper mesh with what they call The Phantom Fit

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.820
which is supposed to embrace the shape of your foot seamlessly.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.300
It has a pretty sturdy outsole for a minimalist shoe.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.740
It's not thick but it looks strong enough to handle light trails

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.380
and obviously perfect for long distance running on the road.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.940
Quite flexible, overall it looks like a very comfortable shoe.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.560
And it looks really  nice!

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.600
Love the colors, the details!

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.680
Let's try them out!

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.280
So besides looking nice, they are extremely comfortable so far

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.520
Very flexible, it feels like I'm walking on clouds.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:57.040
I can feel the s ole, especially the lugs around the mid-foot

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:04.120
and it seems to encourage me to hit with a mid-foot strike kind of like the Newton MV2s

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.120
But in a more subtle way

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.480
OK, now I'm going to  go for a run

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.880
and I'll give a more in-depth review after a couple of weeks

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.520
Once I've logged some quality time and workouts in this beauties!

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.240
Thanks for watching, see you around!
