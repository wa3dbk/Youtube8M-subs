my name is Linda late and I moved here
from<00:00:22.359> Alberta<00:00:22.839> but<00:00:23.230> I<00:00:23.380> grew<00:00:23.589> up<00:00:23.650> both<00:00:24.009> in

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:24.189 
from Alberta but I grew up both in

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:30.810 
currently completing a PhD in biology
focusing<00:00:29.470> on<00:00:29.619> molecular<00:00:29.919> biology<00:00:30.579> and

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
focusing on molecular biology and

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.010 
focusing on molecular biology and
evolution<00:00:32.160> I'm<00:00:33.160> studying<00:00:33.670> the<00:00:34.020> population

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.020 
evolution I'm studying the population

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.709 
evolution I'm studying the population
genetics<00:00:35.500> and<00:00:35.770> population<00:00:36.460> structure<00:00:36.820> of<00:00:37.239> two

00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:37.719 
genetics and population structure of two

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:40.229

at<00:00:38.050> risk<00:00:38.350> marine<00:00:38.739> fish<00:00:38.949> species<00:00:39.190> the<00:00:39.850> Atlantic

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:40.239 
at risk marine fish species the Atlantic

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.750 
at risk marine fish species the Atlantic
cod<00:00:40.420> and<00:00:40.719> the<00:00:40.809> Atlantic<00:00:41.230> wolffish<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:42.640> what

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
cod and the Atlantic wolffish so what

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.549 
cod and the Atlantic wolffish so what
we're<00:00:42.879> doing<00:00:42.910> is<00:00:43.269> we're<00:00:43.510> using<00:00:43.690> the<00:00:43.989> fish<00:00:44.140> DNA

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
we're doing is we're using the fish DNA

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:46.950 
we're doing is we're using the fish DNA
to<00:00:44.829> try<00:00:45.010> to<00:00:45.070> understand<00:00:45.670> how<00:00:46.269> the<00:00:46.329> populations

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
to try to understand how the populations

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.319 
to try to understand how the populations
are<00:00:47.109> structured<00:00:47.590> so<00:00:48.309> if<00:00:48.460> you<00:00:48.579> have<00:00:48.730> two<00:00:49.030> fish

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
are structured so if you have two fish

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.479 
are structured so if you have two fish
one<00:00:49.359> in<00:00:49.870> population<00:00:50.469> in<00:00:50.590> Labrador<00:00:51.010> and<00:00:51.250> one<00:00:51.399> in

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
one in population in Labrador and one in

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.939 
one in population in Labrador and one in
population<00:00:52.179> in<00:00:52.359> Newfoundland<00:00:53.079> we<00:00:53.649> can<00:00:53.800> tell

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949 
population in Newfoundland we can tell

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:56.220 
population in Newfoundland we can tell
whether<00:00:54.160> there's<00:00:54.429> any<00:00:54.579> kind<00:00:54.850> of<00:00:55.109> dispersal<00:00:56.109> or

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
whether there's any kind of dispersal or

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.990 
whether there's any kind of dispersal or
gene<00:00:56.440> flow<00:00:56.649> going<00:00:56.980> on<00:00:57.219> between<00:00:57.460> the<00:00:57.760> different

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
gene flow going on between the different

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.569 
gene flow going on between the different
populations<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:59.710> could<00:00:59.890> be<00:00:59.980> important<00:01:00.519> for

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
populations this could be important for

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:02.700 
populations this could be important for
things<00:01:00.969> such<00:01:01.179> as<00:01:01.239> conservation<00:01:02.230> of<00:01:02.379> the<00:01:02.440> fish

there's lots of connections going on i

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.910 
there's lots of connections going on i
chose<00:01:12.369> to<00:01:12.790> compare<00:01:13.090> it<00:01:13.119> to<00:01:13.270> memorial

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
when i was doing my masters in alberta I

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.740 
when i was doing my masters in alberta I
came<00:01:18.640> out<00:01:18.850> and<00:01:19.180> did<00:01:19.240> field<00:01:19.479> work<00:01:19.570> in

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
came out and did field work in

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.660 
came out and did field work in
Newfoundland<00:01:20.200> for<00:01:20.409> two<00:01:20.560> weeks<00:01:20.770> I<00:01:21.009> fell<00:01:21.549> in

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
Newfoundland for two weeks I fell in

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.280 
Newfoundland for two weeks I fell in
love<00:01:21.729> with<00:01:21.850> the<00:01:22.030> province<00:01:22.420> and<00:01:22.630> I<00:01:22.780> decided<00:01:23.110> I

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
love with the province and I decided I

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.630 
love with the province and I decided I
wanted<00:01:23.500> to<00:01:23.619> come<00:01:23.770> out<00:01:23.799> and<00:01:23.950> spend<00:01:24.250> some<00:01:24.369> time

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
wanted to come out and spend some time

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
here he's living in McDowell and is very

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.660 
here he's living in McDowell and is very
different<00:01:29.049> than<00:01:29.290> living<00:01:29.619> in<00:01:29.950> anywhere<00:01:30.460> else

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
different than living in anywhere else

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.950 
different than living in anywhere else
I've<00:01:30.880> lived<00:01:31.030> before<00:01:31.229> it's<00:01:32.229> a<00:01:32.469> very<00:01:33.360> small<00:01:34.360> city

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
I've lived before it's a very small city

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.600 
I've lived before it's a very small city
which<00:01:35.259> is<00:01:35.409> very<00:01:35.590> nice<00:01:35.770> you<00:01:36.040> can<00:01:36.130> get<00:01:36.310> anywhere

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
which is very nice you can get anywhere

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:37.340 
which is very nice you can get anywhere
and<00:01:36.909> pretty<00:01:37.119> much

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
and pretty much

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.499 
and pretty much
sort<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.530> 10<00:01:37.710> or<00:01:37.740> 15<00:01:38.130> minutes<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:39.030> also<00:01:39.210> has

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
sort of 10 or 15 minutes it also has

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.910 
sort of 10 or 15 minutes it also has
some<00:01:39.689> very<00:01:39.840> beautiful<00:01:40.380> scenery<00:01:40.770> and

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
some very beautiful scenery and

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.130 
some very beautiful scenery and
countryside<00:01:41.490> with<00:01:42.090> in<00:01:42.240> sort<00:01:42.450> of<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.570> 10<00:01:42.750> or<00:01:42.869> 15

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
countryside with in sort of a 10 or 15

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.929 
countryside with in sort of a 10 or 15
minute<00:01:43.380> drive<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:43.950> it's<00:01:44.189> just<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.580> really<00:01:44.610> nice

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
minute drive so it's just a really nice

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.039 
minute drive so it's just a really nice
place<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.330> live<00:01:47.509> there's<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.600> number<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:48.869> things

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
place to live there's a number of things

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.200 
place to live there's a number of things
about<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.590> graduate<00:01:50.009> study<00:01:50.399> program<00:01:50.909> at

about the graduate study program at

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.539 
about the graduate study program at
Memorial<00:01:51.659> University<00:01:52.070> which<00:01:53.070> make<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.490> a

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
Memorial University which make it a

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.700 
Memorial University which make it a
really<00:01:53.700> good<00:01:53.880> place<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.270> go<00:01:54.450> so<00:01:55.350> it's<00:01:55.500> much

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
really good place to go so it's much

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.980 
really good place to go so it's much
larger<00:01:56.340> graduate<00:01:57.060> program<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.539> I'm<00:01:57.659> used<00:01:57.869> to

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
larger graduate program that I'm used to

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.660 
larger graduate program that I'm used to
coming<00:01:58.380> from<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.710> smaller<00:01:59.039> university<00:01:59.580> in

Alberta but even though there are a lot

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.620 
Alberta but even though there are a lot
of<00:02:01.950> graduate<00:02:02.399> students<00:02:02.789> they<00:02:03.180> seem<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.420> be<00:02:03.539> a

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
of graduate students they seem to be a

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.120 
of graduate students they seem to be a
fairly<00:02:03.899> tight<00:02:04.200> knit<00:02:04.409> community<00:02:04.440> which<00:02:05.009> is

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
fairly tight knit community which is
