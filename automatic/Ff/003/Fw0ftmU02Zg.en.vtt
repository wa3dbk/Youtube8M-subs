00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.410
 strong off the truth is that this is one 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.970
 of my favorite dishes so I hope 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.680
 that you enjoy eating so much 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.300

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.519
 this dish we are going to need the 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.470
 following ingredients the first thing that 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:20.519
 we need is a couple of lettuces that 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.519
 they can be how are you 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.610
 one onion 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.610
 half red pepper 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.550
 a spoonful of fried tomato 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:38.309
 a few teaspoons of brandy 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.309
 and the juice of a whole lemon 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.450
 mushrooms 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.940
 Butter 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:51.120
 born 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.920
 and as an accompaniment rice 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.260
 Now let's start proceed to do 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.210
 the first plane that we are going to make 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.370
 to make this dish is to take a 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.829
 butter spoon 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.650
 more or less jacint and we let him 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:08.900
 second part 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.900
 we see how the butter is getting 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.780
 if we go then proceed to 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.780
 know the chopped onion 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.320
 all the onion 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.390
 yes 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.090
 and we leave it behind until they fit 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.090
 cut 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.070
 then by we should throw him the 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.290
 Red pepper 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.310
 we have as we have cut it into strips 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:52.620
 thin that we will brown them during 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.450
 a while until it is well done 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.920
 once we see that growth 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:03.009
 it is well browned we will proceed to the asad 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.009
 three tablespoons of tomato one 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.759
 two 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.440
 and we proceed to mix them very well 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.440
 this form 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.800
 we leave it approximately at the end of 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.290
 a couple of minutes and we're going to proceed 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.120
 it's in the chicken as you see the chicken what 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:32.310
 we have cut into strips and we have 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:36.940
 worked then we say the content 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.760
 and we remove it well and then 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.810
 let's take 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.810
 the lemon juice 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:50.350
 thus 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.350
 also the tablespoons of brandy 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:58.530
 we'll see 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.530
 we will take the brandy and three tablespoons 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.990
 a 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.740
 two 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:07.160
 and three 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:09.230
 and now we remove everything well and what 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.000
 we let do until the chicken we see 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.310
 that is that 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.410
 while the chicken is being made we are going 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.990
 to let go see some water with 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.730
 a pinch of salt so that to go 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.890
 taking the rice that goes with 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.510
 the chicken I'm going to make two handfuls 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.430
 of rice which is what correspond to 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.740
 two people but if you are going to do more 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.680
 there is rice equivalent to so many 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.200
 guests as you are 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.269
 the option we are going to use the mushrooms 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.099
 before serving it is important that 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:39.370
 we know well has we will remove all the 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:42.099
 sand once drained we will catch and 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:46.030
 the savage the bazaar I have in this way 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:47.920
 and we are going to let them be done well 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.290
 once we see that they are already coming 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.470
 they are the perfect mushrooms that is so 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:56.260
 soft that we will proceed to throw nothing 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:04:00.270
 we take the cream grip to cook and 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.270
 we lost it all whole 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.430
 thus 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.910
 what we will do is mix everything well 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.100
 It is the way 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.750
 so that everything is well mixed 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.070
 once everything is well mixed what 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.380
 let's leave cooking for 5 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.870
 more minutes for the chicken to put on 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.780
 creamy that gives it that flavor that is 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.120
 family that has nothing once 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.160
 finished cooking the pelister dish to 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.080
 this aspect of wanting less we will have to 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.090
 that is the cream this means 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.990
 which is approach to make seen 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.960
 continuation 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.529
 we take and serve on a plate like this 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.079
 and we put 

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:54.259
 a few spoonfuls in the center of the 

00:04:52.079 --> 00:04:54.259
 plate 

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:00.599
 A) Yes 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.599
 and a little more 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:08.990
 and the faculty and you take and would stay 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:12.110
 perfect end then for 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:15.439
 let's catch decorate and we will 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:17.270
 throw the rice you see me for this case 

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:19.490
 integral users but you can 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:23.180
 use any type of rice like 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:25.660
 rice rice clothing pump long Marian 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:28.030
 wild any possible 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.780
 let's see how we are going around the bun with 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.710
 rice 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.710
 of these forces 

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:38.999
 finally the center plate east 

00:05:36.809 --> 00:05:41.219
 how can you have been able to check 

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:43.199
 It is a very easy dish to make and 

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:45.389
 really its flavor is impressive 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:47.279
 I hope you all enjoy cooking what 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:50.269
