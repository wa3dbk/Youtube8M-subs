00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.750
 Hello to you and Jeka is a channel pisi 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.290
 life today's video will be from two 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.040
 video cards 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:14.610
 1 in the company md Rodion Series r9 270x 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.949
 2 companies nvidia gtx 760 compare them 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.690
 there will be two games this is gta 5 and mortal 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.880
 kombat 10 by the way both video cards 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.310
 made with vendor msc 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.779
 ethnic groups ruler gaming a little later 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.820
 I will spend the most complete testing of these 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.410
 video cards in all the other games that 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.529
 only I have at the time of removal 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.270
 this video and mass r9 270x cost 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.960
 about 168 dollars 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.840
 gtx760 200 one dollar to 34 dollars 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.730
 more expensive than 270x of the main parameters 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.850
 can be noted two gigabytes of video memory 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.730
 gddr5 bus 256 bit such parameters on 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.980
 both r9 270x video cards by type i 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.289
 pushed on 120 megahertz memory out of the box 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.840
 worked at a frequency of 5600 girov 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.750
 dispersed up to 6120 megahertz frequency 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.120
 gtx760 graphic chip succeeded 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.719
 overclock at 130 megahertz and the frequency 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.379
 of memory 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.630
 s6000 8 megahertz to 7300 8 megahertz 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.590
 full list of test configuration in 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.409
 video description 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.500
 I will note only the i7 3770 processor 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.960
 overclocked to 4500 megahertz in general 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.060
 let's start let's start with gta 5 settings 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.770
 identical on both full hd video cards 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.570
 resolution smoothing completely 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.130
 the type of population is disabled 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.630
 reduced to half since the choice 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.670
 higher value exceeds limit 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.009
 video memory other graphics options 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.340
 matters high extra 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.930
 graphics options are disabled 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.170
 left r9 270x 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.880
 on the right gtx760 as difference graphics 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.880
 No, but in fps there is 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:52.280
 what is the result is fps on r9 270x 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:57.470
 minimum 46 by 760 x 67 average FPS 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:59.300
 52 x 270 x and 82 x 760 result 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.720
 overclocked graphics are green 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:06.680
 On r9 270x overclocking ps turned out 58 in 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.190
 average on gtx760 87 also made a measurement 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.920
 fps 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.420
 scientists fxp its smoothing graph in front 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.920
 you can also download it by 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.780
 link in the description for this video 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.720
 before moving on to mortal kombat 10 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.010
 small total relative r9 270x and 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.170
 gtx760 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.810
 if you aim at playing exclusively in 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:27.680
 gta5 your choice is gtx760 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.690
 other side gtx760 more expensive than r9 270x 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.550
 I decided to display the cost of 1 fps on 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.530
 each video card for this price 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.459
 video card must be divided into medium 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.730
 number of fps 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.980
 that is, 270x that 168 dollars divide by 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.910
 52 is the average FPS and we get 3 dollars 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.910
 23 cents and i.e. cost of 1 fps 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:49.459
 gtx760 worth 200 1 dollar divide by 82 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.080
 get 2 dollars 45 cents pick 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.510
 obvious in favor and nvidia at least 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.519
 least in gta 5 which it seems to me a 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.620
 rockstar blinded by green 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:00.080
 spoke in past videos, figured out 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.790
 Now we go to the battalion of the battalion 10 mortal 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.410
 kombat all settings are set to ultra 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.570
 anti-aliasing enabled extra 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.720
 parameters included and what happened 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.720
 here 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.610
 average fps is the same on both maps 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.220
 but if anyone knows the combos 10 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.160
 blocked at 60fps i mean more you 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.830
 do not get but the minimum fps on 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.600
 270x higher significant than 760 and 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.940
 Feels like playing much more comfortable for 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.590
 its water cost 1 fps I will not take 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.930
 average since it is equally well 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.230
 the minimum total cost per vps 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:47.380
 at 270 x 3 dollars exactly turn 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.690
 one fps 760 cost 4 dollars 46 cents 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.190
 Of course, based on the indicators 2 games 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.870
 judging quite hard but I wanted 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.530
 find out first how everyone will spend 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.540
 270x and 760 namely mortal kombat and gta 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.230
 5 and I would also like to talk again 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.600
 about smoothing 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.970
 and that fxp doesn't work on md 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.400
 video cards and on the contrary prevents these 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:09.250
 two fragments recorded on gtx760 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.690
 fx on the left and on the right is enabled on the disabled 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.760
 image on the left even to the naked 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.980
 you can see the ladder as on the nearest 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.750
 facilities so for more distant yes price 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.400
 for smoothing soapy textures this 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.959
 clearly visible on the road stop sign 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.530
 when you turn on anti-aliasing inscription 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:26.320
 It became visibly blur the fragment 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.030
 recorded on r9 270x video card 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.460
 it is evident that the gum has become much smaller 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.070
 but also blurry textures go well 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.720
 visible on water texture 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.340
 cut your eyes a blessing or look at 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.650
 earthy textures are up to you 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.660
 Noah x-ray affects FPS video card 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.150
 andy no more than nvidia cards 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.950
 and to get rid of unnecessary comments 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.780
 explain why and vps on video and on 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.070
 the final graphics is different this 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.130
 I recorded the fragment with the help 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.060
 camcorder as seen fps area 85 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.010
 88 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.500
 then the recording start indicator appears 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.090
 fps you to level 5058 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.430
 and the CPU load is sharp 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.470
 video comparison of the two increases 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.300
 video cards only give an idea of ​​the difference 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.250
 picture quality at different by viewers 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.930
 and the approximate difference in frames is such 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.390
 ambiguous test turned out today 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:13.180
 if you want to play gta take nvidia gtx 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.229
 760 want to play reeled coma door r9 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.910
 270x 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:17.770
 as I said a little bit later, I 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.690
 I will do a full review of these video cards and 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.300
 separately and together compared 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.740
 order 12 and 13 games as well as these videos 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:27.220
 card will take part in big 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:31.720
 Comparison where will besides 270 x 763 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:34.660
 there will also be 208 5 tm d 280 x from n.d. 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.640
 and 960 from invidia I hope the video was for 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.240
 good for you, but with you there was also a channel 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.350
 the sea life 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.350
 know more and be me
