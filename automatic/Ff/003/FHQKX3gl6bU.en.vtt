00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:29.089 

I<00:00:27.410> wonder<00:00:28.410> who<00:00:28.529> could<00:00:28.560> live<00:00:28.740> in<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:28.919> hole<00:00:29.070> like

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
I wonder who could live in a hole like

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.200 
I wonder who could live in a hole like
that<00:00:29.330> and<00:00:30.330> now<00:00:30.509> I'm<00:00:31.019> asked<00:00:31.259> you<00:00:31.499> think<00:00:32.210> who

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
that and now I'm asked you think who

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.700 
that and now I'm asked you think who
else<00:00:33.390> might<00:00:33.600> live<00:00:33.750> in<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.900> hole<00:00:34.050> like<00:00:34.079> that<00:00:34.289> ads

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
else might live in a hole like that ads

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.490 
else might live in a hole like that ads
and<00:00:38.539> snakes<00:00:39.539> new<00:00:39.750> in<00:00:39.840> house<00:00:39.989> so<00:00:40.020> there's<00:00:40.320> lots

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
and snakes new in house so there's lots

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.950 
and snakes new in house so there's lots
of<00:00:40.620> things<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:40.980> could<00:00:41.100> be<00:00:41.809> detective<00:00:42.809> work

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
of things it could be detective work

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:50.720 
of things it could be detective work
weren't<00:00:43.199> we<00:00:48.590> it's<00:00:49.590> an<00:00:49.949> opportunity<00:00:50.399> really

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
weren't we it's an opportunity really

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.520 
weren't we it's an opportunity really
for<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.059> children<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.600> be<00:00:51.780> outside<00:00:52.320> to

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
for the children to be outside to

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.009 
for the children to be outside to
explore<00:00:52.980> outside<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.670> take<00:00:53.910> risks<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.570> learn

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.019 
explore outside to take risks to learn

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:56.720 
explore outside to take risks to learn
about<00:00:55.289> nature<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:56.039> learn<00:00:56.190> about<00:00:56.309> looking

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
about nature to learn about looking

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.700 
about nature to learn about looking
after<00:00:57.030> their<00:00:57.180> environment<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:58.500> think

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
after their environment and I think

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.259 
after their environment and I think
there's<00:00:58.829> also<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.160> thought<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.460> moving<00:00:59.670> to

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
there's also the thought of moving to

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:02.689 
there's also the thought of moving to
the<00:01:00.359> future<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.050> then<00:01:01.710> respecting<00:01:02.579> and

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
the future and then respecting and

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.189 
the future and then respecting and
understanding<00:01:02.730> I'm<00:01:03.329> wanting<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.719> keep<00:01:03.989> the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
understanding I'm wanting to keep the

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.280 
understanding I'm wanting to keep the
woodland<00:01:04.590> going<00:01:05.519> it's<00:01:06.509> to<00:01:06.659> give<00:01:06.810> them<00:01:07.049> that

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
woodland going it's to give them that

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.469 
woodland going it's to give them that
ethos<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.340> importance<00:01:08.880> really<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.270> being

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
ethos of the importance really of being

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.390 
ethos of the importance really of being
outside<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:10.170> having<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.740> environment<00:01:11.280> to

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
outside and of having the environment to

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.370 
outside and of having the environment to
be<00:01:11.549> in<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:12.299> first<00:01:12.540> challenge<00:01:13.020> is<00:01:13.080> supposed<00:01:13.350> to

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
be in the first challenge is supposed to

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.350 
be in the first challenge is supposed to
get<00:01:13.530> ourselves<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:14.040> hot<00:01:14.189> drink<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:15.060> what<00:01:15.180> do<00:01:15.270> we

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
get ourselves a hot drink so what do we

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:23.810 
get ourselves a hot drink so what do we
ever<00:01:15.450> have<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.720> do<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.900> get<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.049> hot<00:01:16.290> drink<00:01:22.820> as

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
ever have to do to get a hot drink as

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.490 
ever have to do to get a hot drink as
they<00:01:24.060> get<00:01:24.150> into<00:01:24.329> reception<00:01:24.720> we<00:01:25.170> start

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
they get into reception we start

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.859 
they get into reception we start
lighting<00:01:26.130> fires<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:27.299> they're<00:01:27.479> learn<00:01:27.659> about

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
lighting fires so they're learn about

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.080 
lighting fires so they're learn about
sort<00:01:28.079> of<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.200> basics<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.770> wood<00:01:29.640> having<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.000> be

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
sort of the basics of wood having to be

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.090 
sort of the basics of wood having to be
dry<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.689> having<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.200> have<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.500> spark<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:32.040> start

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
dry of having to have a spark to start

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:39.460 
dry of having to have a spark to start
the<00:01:32.430> fire

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.899 

we<00:01:40.470> very<00:01:40.680> much<00:01:40.860> talked<00:01:41.159> through<00:01:41.460> all<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.729> the

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
we very much talked through all of the

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.520 
we very much talked through all of the
dangers<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.360> all<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.600> risks<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.200> they

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
dangers and all the risks so that they

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.870 
dangers and all the risks so that they
are<00:01:43.830> aware<00:01:46.009> shielding<00:01:47.009> can<00:01:47.130> take<00:01:47.340> on<00:01:47.520> an<00:01:47.610> awful

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
are aware shielding can take on an awful

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.630 
are aware shielding can take on an awful
lot<00:01:48.000> more<00:01:48.030> than<00:01:48.479> we<00:01:49.020> expect<00:01:49.680> them<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.369> I

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
lot more than we expect them to and I

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.070 
lot more than we expect them to and I
think<00:01:50.820> if<00:01:50.880> you've<00:01:51.000> got<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.270> expectation<00:01:51.960> of

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
think if you've got that expectation of

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.960 
think if you've got that expectation of
them<00:01:52.290> they<00:01:52.920> take<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.280> on<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.549> they<00:01:53.640> grow<00:01:53.820> with

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
them they take it on and they grow with

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:05.359 
them they take it on and they grow with
it<00:01:54.090> really<00:02:02.119> by<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.180> end<00:02:03.330> of<00:02:03.509> today<00:02:04.340> we<00:02:05.340> are

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
it really by the end of today we are

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.290 
it really by the end of today we are
going<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.909> have<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.539> Ford<00:02:07.080> school<00:02:07.350> band<00:02:10.100> okay<00:02:11.100> so

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
going to have a Ford school band okay so

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.430 
going to have a Ford school band okay so
that's<00:02:12.300> your<00:02:12.450> challenge<00:02:12.750> I<00:02:13.050> want<00:02:13.230> you<00:02:13.319> to

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
that's your challenge I want you to

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.039 
that's your challenge I want you to
think<00:02:13.650> about<00:02:13.680> that<00:02:14.010> now<00:02:14.220> about<00:02:15.180> going<00:02:15.480> off<00:02:15.810> and

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
think about that now about going off and

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:18.320 
think about that now about going off and
finding<00:02:16.890> and<00:02:17.100> instrument<00:02:17.819> these<00:02:17.970> like<00:02:18.180> to

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
finding and instrument these like to

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.050 
finding and instrument these like to
make<00:02:18.480> yeah<00:02:19.370> Claud<00:02:20.370> are<00:02:20.400> you<00:02:20.519> making<00:02:20.760> a<00:02:20.819> kazoo

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
make yeah Claud are you making a kazoo

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.039 
make yeah Claud are you making a kazoo
you<00:02:21.690> are<00:02:21.840> then<00:02:23.450> you<00:02:24.450> then<00:02:24.600> you<00:02:24.690> start<00:02:24.930> using

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
you are then you then you start using

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.830 
you are then you then you start using
tools<00:02:25.500> so<00:02:26.100> they'll<00:02:26.430> use<00:02:26.640> potato<00:02:27.090> peelers<00:02:27.600> and

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
tools so they'll use potato peelers and

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.570 
tools so they'll use potato peelers and
they'll<00:02:27.989> use<00:02:28.140> a<00:02:28.170> knife<00:02:28.470> they'll<00:02:29.190> use<00:02:29.340> a<00:02:29.370> bow

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
they'll use a knife they'll use a bow

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.360 
they'll use a knife they'll use a bow
saw<00:02:30.290> so<00:02:31.290> there's<00:02:31.470> something<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:32.010> develop

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
saw so there's something to develop

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.880 
saw so there's something to develop
those<00:02:32.870> initial<00:02:33.870> skills<00:02:34.140> of<00:02:34.319> tool<00:02:34.500> use<00:02:34.530> really

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
those initial skills of tool use really

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.590 
those initial skills of tool use really
probably<00:02:35.430> more<00:02:35.880> tools<00:02:36.150> than<00:02:36.299> you'd<00:02:36.510> expect

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
probably more tools than you'd expect

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.380 
probably more tools than you'd expect
for<00:02:37.019> in<00:02:37.230> five<00:02:37.410> years<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.830> be<00:02:37.950> using<00:02:38.310> but<00:02:38.730> they

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
for in five years to be using but they

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.729 
for in five years to be using but they
seem<00:02:39.600> to<00:02:39.630> cope<00:02:40.049> with<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.260> very<00:02:40.290> well<00:02:40.470> and

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
seem to cope with it very well and

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:41.990 
seem to cope with it very well and
they're<00:02:40.950> really<00:02:41.100> excited<00:02:41.459> at<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.790> things

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
they're really excited at the things
