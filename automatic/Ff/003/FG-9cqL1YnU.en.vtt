00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.800
 tradition that of yesteryear 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.340
 his mom I guess he learned it too 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.950
 from his mom my mom did it like 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:14.110
 flame is this technique 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.700
 well the truth evra last if it was passed 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.009
 that the one that I have here in my hands 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.829
 because it's called the last thread 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:24.360
 because that is going to happen nothing else is going 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:26.670
 happening and the crossing point is different 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.230
 or that already told us what is last thread 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.470
 What I was doing right now is 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:35.649
 addressing this as it is called nothing of 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:41.539
 point because the point is smaller 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:43.759

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:30.520
 we are talking about a machine of 25 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:35.500
 weights for a frame already complete for 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:38.200

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.200

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:47.860

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:28.700
 not the one that comes out by putting them on you does not say 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.760

 It costs 50 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.510
 and you win 100 or you already have 50 left 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.550
 gain gain weights but already 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.400
