00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:37.030
 himself master on the other side of him 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:42.559
 no public opinion prevails 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:46.429
 babies inside there is very clear it

 catch nicks tight fixed frames 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.980
 these people cannot be caught because 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.490
 independence because free 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:15.740
 thinking and because the desire to slip away 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.070
 out of any framework and restrictions 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.080
 this is part of their natural nature 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.570
 which is revealed itself of childhood itself 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:28.210
 violent independent not controlled not 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:30.549
 under which are not under whose game his overweening 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:34.049
 energy management in this sense even 8 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:35.710
 arches that have great power 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.190
 discipline organize everything 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.220
 around 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.830
 even they give up on communicating with 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:46.509
 nines is that nine is a symbol 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:49.659
 freedom is a number that is impossible 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:51.490
 hook on even for something i personally 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.759
 sense if you go back to the story 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.570
 one started started hanging this one on 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.640
 water 9 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.750
 Nine it finishes one 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:04.479
 i symbolizes my and bright and creative 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:09.070
 leadership start that just went into 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:12.820
 this world and this egocentrism in such a very 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:15.300
 bright beautiful prime in three as 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.550
 nine is the last man person 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.700
 lets go all personal and nine more 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.200
 all may be motivated 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.989
 universal things service 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.260
 humanity desire to participate 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:31.840
 some kind of global large-scale 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.480
 projects for the benefit of the whole world for the benefit of 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.489
 humanity for the benefit of the collective but not 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.190
 for the benefit of yourself you can of course for the benefit 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:43.030
 yourself but for nine it's too petty 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.799
 not interesting in this sense nine 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.450
 most of your soul 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:53.019
 potential reveals when she 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:56.079
 included in something important in something important 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:03:00.579
 for all she feels more potential 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:02.500
 when she does something for everyone and this 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:05.860
 not that altruism is just 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:10.409
 natural inner desire to carry 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:12.430
 happiness bring happiness and not even 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:14.220
 to some individual 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.549
 personal circle of loved ones 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:21.549
 she is the whole world and in that sense if 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:24.580
 speak the chakra language then nine is in 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:27.310
 the first thing sahasrara is to merge with 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.470
 the world but they possess very good 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:33.670
 anahats they are very attentive with any 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.409
 suitable for people around and they carry 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:40.299
 is a world view 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:42.160
 not a greenhouse about its concept of the world but that 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.069
 sense that they never hover anyone and 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.569
 they respect religious freedom 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:49.900
 freedom of thinking in each other 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:52.660
 man communicating with him do you understand or 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:56.140
 with her you can understand that we are all people here 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:59.290
 the universe we are not even the people of this clan we 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:02.079
 not the people of this side and we are people born 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:06.519
 this universe is completely different 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:07.450
 universal format thinking and they all 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.450
 very much 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:15.849
 included muladhara especially in women then 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:18.489

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:21.840
 vortex of energy that possesses 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:25.539
 tremendous vitality 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:28.120
 survival ability for men there 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:31.479
 she reveals the number more phlegmatic 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:36.660
 weakened and does not necessarily give such 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:37.810
 a whirlwind of energy for women 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.000
 to consider 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.830
 where matt could nine get 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.710
 if a 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:48.720
 parse the calculation of your date of birth then 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:52.030
 here will be so 36 these are people 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:55.210
 transcendental knowledge of the world 27 this 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:57.580
 more such included society more 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.490
 interested in playing but always 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:03.240
 remaining on the verge of it proper on 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.530
 the edges of this all reality they are always 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.740
 they turn on but at the same time they 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:12.430
 look outside the world and love this 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:17.320
 the world but at the same time they don't seem to be 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:19.570
 from this world, and 1818 already bears some 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:24.160
 such a spiritual duty to all of this 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:27.070
 world in this sense they have a high 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:30.030
 spiritual morality and value make your 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.030
