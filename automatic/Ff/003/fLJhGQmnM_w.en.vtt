when<00:00:11.110> you<00:00:11.200> take<00:00:11.380> a<00:00:11.410> look<00:00:11.590> at<00:00:11.710> Mars<00:00:11.920> you

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:12.400 
when you take a look at Mars you

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.589 
when you take a look at Mars you
probably<00:00:12.730> wouldn't<00:00:13.090> think<00:00:13.179> that<00:00:13.299> it<00:00:13.389> looks

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:13.599 
probably wouldn't think that it looks

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:16.049 
probably wouldn't think that it looks
like<00:00:13.660> a<00:00:13.780> very<00:00:14.019> nice<00:00:14.170> place<00:00:14.440> to<00:00:14.590> live<00:00:14.769> it's<00:00:15.700> dry

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:16.059 
like a very nice place to live it's dry

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.910 
like a very nice place to live it's dry
its<00:00:16.480> dusty<00:00:16.599> and<00:00:17.080> there's<00:00:17.349> practically<00:00:17.800> no

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:17.920 
its dusty and there's practically no

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.010 
its dusty and there's practically no
atmosphere<00:00:18.430> but<00:00:19.240> some<00:00:19.450> scientists<00:00:19.930> think

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.020 
atmosphere but some scientists think

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.269 
atmosphere but some scientists think
that<00:00:20.140> Mars<00:00:20.230> may<00:00:20.590> have<00:00:20.619> once<00:00:20.890> looked<00:00:21.130> like<00:00:21.250> a

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:21.279 
that Mars may have once looked like a

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:23.249 
that Mars may have once looked like a
much<00:00:21.520> nicer<00:00:21.910> place<00:00:22.060> to<00:00:22.150> live<00:00:22.450> with<00:00:22.930> a<00:00:22.960> thicker

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:23.259 
much nicer place to live with a thicker

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:25.529 
much nicer place to live with a thicker
atmosphere<00:00:23.289> cloudy<00:00:24.279> skies<00:00:24.640> and<00:00:24.939> possibly

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:25.539 
atmosphere cloudy skies and possibly

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:26.910 
atmosphere cloudy skies and possibly
even<00:00:25.840> liquid<00:00:26.020> water<00:00:26.289> flowing<00:00:26.710> over<00:00:26.800> the

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:26.920 
even liquid water flowing over the

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.800 
even liquid water flowing over the
surface<00:00:27.039> so<00:00:28.029> how<00:00:28.150> do<00:00:28.210> you<00:00:28.300> go<00:00:28.449> from<00:00:28.660> something

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
surface so how do you go from something

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.490 
surface so how do you go from something
like<00:00:29.109> this<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:30.340> something<00:00:30.580> like<00:00:30.789> this<00:00:31.500> NASA's

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.920 
idea of how Mars lost its atmosphere and
scientists<00:00:36.699> think<00:00:36.879> that<00:00:36.940> several<00:00:37.390> processes
