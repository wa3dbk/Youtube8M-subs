and<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.530> click<00:01:58.740> drops<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.340> so<00:01:59.579> be<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.820> good<00:01:59.850> way

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
and you click drops to so be a good way

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.760 
and you click drops to so be a good way
to<00:02:00.149> get<00:02:00.420> experience<00:02:00.869> from<00:02:01.200> stuff<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:01.560> didn't

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
to get experience from stuff you didn't

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.300 
to get experience from stuff you didn't
actually<00:02:01.920> kill<00:02:03.140> but<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:04.409> space<00:02:04.770> Scout<00:02:05.009> works

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
actually kill but I space Scout works

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.660 
actually kill but I space Scout works
and<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:06.509> reason<00:02:06.689> that's<00:02:06.960> um<00:02:07.439> one<00:02:08.340> below

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
and the reason that's um one below

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.160 
and the reason that's um one below
ceiling<00:02:09.060> like<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.270> could<00:02:09.450> be<00:02:09.539> like<00:02:09.660> right<00:02:09.840> here

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
ceiling like it could be like right here

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.949 
ceiling like it could be like right here
in<00:02:10.289> this<00:02:10.560> area<00:02:10.739> right<00:02:10.950> here<00:02:11.720> because<00:02:12.720> because

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
in this area right here because because

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.520 
in this area right here because because
if

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
if

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.720 
if
it<00:02:13.590> was<00:02:13.709> right<00:02:13.890> here<00:02:13.920> on<00:02:14.310> this<00:02:14.400> block<00:02:14.700> right

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
it was right here on this block right

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.490 
it was right here on this block right
here<00:02:14.880> it<00:02:15.540> could<00:02:15.750> actually<00:02:15.930> shoot<00:02:16.260> through

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
here it could actually shoot through

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.140 
here it could actually shoot through
that<00:02:16.680> block<00:02:16.920> which<00:02:17.220> isn't<00:02:17.580> what<00:02:17.790> I<00:02:17.819> want<00:02:18.060> to

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
that block which isn't what I want to

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.360 
that block which isn't what I want to
happen<00:02:18.270> because<00:02:18.709> you<00:02:19.709> mean<00:02:19.860> you<00:02:19.980> guys<00:02:20.130> can

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
happen because you mean you guys can

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.530 
happen because you mean you guys can
have<00:02:20.520> that<00:02:20.640> happen<00:02:21.000> just<00:02:21.180> have<00:02:21.390> one

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
have that happen just have one

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.990 
have that happen just have one
underground<00:02:21.930> that'd<00:02:22.470> be<00:02:22.650> good<00:02:23.000> defense

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
underground that'd be good defense

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.090 
underground that'd be good defense
system<00:02:24.410> but<00:02:25.410> it<00:02:25.530> wouldn't<00:02:25.740> be<00:02:25.800> able<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:26.010> like

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
system but it wouldn't be able to like

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.160 
system but it wouldn't be able to like
come<00:02:26.280> up<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:26.580> a<00:02:26.610> lot<00:02:26.700> of<00:02:26.760> stuff<00:02:27.000> which<00:02:27.870> is<00:02:27.900> it

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
come up and a lot of stuff which is it

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.710 
come up and a lot of stuff which is it
the<00:02:28.319> cool<00:02:28.530> part<00:02:28.830> of<00:02:28.950> it<00:02:29.069> in<00:02:29.160> my<00:02:29.280> opinion<00:02:29.720> is

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
the cool part of it in my opinion is

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.990 
the cool part of it in my opinion is
where<00:02:31.560> it<00:02:31.650> comes<00:02:31.860> up<00:02:32.069> out<00:02:32.190> of<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.370> ground<00:02:32.550> and

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
where it comes up out of the ground and

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.820 
where it comes up out of the ground and
start<00:02:33.390> shooting<00:02:33.540> arrows<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:33.930> stuff<00:02:34.020> you

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
start shooting arrows and stuff you

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:35.870 
start shooting arrows and stuff you
don't<00:02:35.010> want<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:35.190> have<00:02:35.310> like<00:02:35.520> she's<00:02:35.700> shooting

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
don't want to have like she's shooting

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.220 
don't want to have like she's shooting
arrows<00:02:36.120> out<00:02:36.209> of<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.360> ground<00:02:36.540> for<00:02:36.810> no<00:02:36.900> apparent

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
arrows out of the ground for no apparent

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.800 
arrows out of the ground for no apparent
reason<00:02:37.260> so<00:02:38.160> I<00:02:38.459> move<00:02:39.030> it<00:02:39.120> down<00:02:39.300> one<00:02:39.540> and<00:02:39.690> that

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
reason so I move it down one and that

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.260 
reason so I move it down one and that
seemed<00:02:40.050> to<00:02:40.080> fix<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.610> so<00:02:41.610> that<00:02:41.640> it<00:02:42.030> will<00:02:42.120> only

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
seemed to fix it so that it will only

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.110 
seemed to fix it so that it will only
shoot<00:02:42.600> it<00:02:42.870> might<00:02:43.440> shoot<00:02:43.709> at<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:44.130> that<00:02:44.880> right

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
shoot it might shoot at the that right

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.729 
shoot it might shoot at the that right
here<00:02:45.390> but<00:02:46.050> it<00:02:46.140> doesn't<00:02:46.260> seem<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.590> do<00:02:46.709> that

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
here but it doesn't seem to do that

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.350 
here but it doesn't seem to do that
actually<00:02:47.370> but<00:02:48.360> it<00:02:49.350> might<00:02:50.060> because<00:02:51.060> it<00:02:51.180> sees<00:02:51.330> a

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
actually but it might because it sees a

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.880 
actually but it might because it sees a
mob<00:02:51.600> with<00:02:51.750> their<00:02:51.900> so<00:02:52.019> mice<00:02:52.200> you<00:02:52.350> get<00:02:52.500> it<00:02:52.620> but<00:02:52.769> it

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
mob with their so mice you get it but it

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.120 
mob with their so mice you get it but it
can't<00:02:53.040> shoot<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.400> block<00:02:54.350> so<00:02:55.350> that's<00:02:55.980> just

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
can't shoot the block so that's just

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.100 
can't shoot the block so that's just
that<00:02:56.400> was<00:02:56.489> just<00:02:56.610> my<00:02:56.700> solution<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.239> that<00:02:57.360> I<00:02:57.630> mean

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
that was just my solution to that I mean

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.360 
that was just my solution to that I mean
you<00:02:58.230> guys<00:02:58.380> can<00:02:58.560> keep<00:02:58.739> that<00:02:58.860> there<00:02:59.069> if<00:02:59.130> you<00:02:59.220> want

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
you guys can keep that there if you want

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.350 
you guys can keep that there if you want
to<00:02:59.489> you<00:02:59.580> don't<00:02:59.760> even<00:02:59.819> have<00:02:59.970> to<00:03:00.060> have<00:03:00.209> this

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
to you don't even have to have this

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.220 
to you don't even have to have this
whole<00:03:00.769> fancy<00:03:01.769> thing<00:03:02.480> underneath<00:03:03.480> it<00:03:03.750> but

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
whole fancy thing underneath it but

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.470 
whole fancy thing underneath it but
pretty<00:03:04.440> much<00:03:04.500> I've<00:03:05.220> got<00:03:05.459> it<00:03:05.580> wired<00:03:05.730> up<00:03:06.000> so<00:03:06.420> you

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
pretty much I've got it wired up so you

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.610 
pretty much I've got it wired up so you
just<00:03:06.690> press<00:03:06.870> a<00:03:06.900> button<00:03:07.140> and<00:03:09.230> the<00:03:10.230> thing<00:03:10.410> comes

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
just press a button and the thing comes

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.410 
just press a button and the thing comes
up<00:03:10.739> and<00:03:10.950> we'll<00:03:11.459> start<00:03:11.640> shooting<00:03:11.940> if<00:03:12.120> you<00:03:12.239> want

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
up and we'll start shooting if you want

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.990 
up and we'll start shooting if you want
to<00:03:12.540> shoot<00:03:12.750> during<00:03:13.280> stuff<00:03:14.280> like<00:03:14.430> that<00:03:14.459> like<00:03:14.640> I

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
to shoot during stuff like that like I

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.080 
to shoot during stuff like that like I
could<00:03:18.799> see<00:03:19.799> this<00:03:19.890> is<00:03:20.070> terrible<00:03:20.459> zombie<00:03:20.880> just

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
could see this is terrible zombie just

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:27.950 
could see this is terrible zombie just
facing<00:03:21.420> me<00:03:21.540> and<00:03:21.660> then<00:03:21.780> it's<00:03:21.989> kind<00:03:22.380> of

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.390 

like<00:03:28.960> Here<00:03:29.200> I<00:03:29.230> am<00:03:29.380> getting<00:03:29.680> chased<00:03:29.950> by<00:03:30.070> a<00:03:30.160> horde

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
like Here I am getting chased by a horde

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.670 
like Here I am getting chased by a horde
of<00:03:30.430> zombies<00:03:30.490> and<00:03:31.060> it<00:03:31.840> kill<00:03:32.020> them<00:03:32.110> all<00:03:32.260> for<00:03:32.440> me<00:03:32.620> I

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
of zombies and it kill them all for me I

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.900 
of zombies and it kill them all for me I
didn't<00:03:32.890> have<00:03:32.950> to<00:03:33.160> take<00:03:33.340> out<00:03:33.460> a<00:03:33.490> sword<00:03:33.820> or

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
didn't have to take out a sword or

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.780 
didn't have to take out a sword or
anything<00:03:34.770> so<00:03:35.770> that's<00:03:36.100> pretty<00:03:36.310> much<00:03:36.400> just<00:03:36.520> how

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
anything so that's pretty much just how

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.260 
anything so that's pretty much just how
you<00:03:36.850> do<00:03:37.060> that<00:03:37.300> and<00:03:38.550> there's<00:03:39.550> actually<00:03:39.910> piston

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.270 
you do that and there's actually piston

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:41.700 
you do that and there's actually piston
underneath<00:03:40.510> this<00:03:40.660> is<00:03:40.840> why<00:03:40.960> this<00:03:41.020> fancy<00:03:41.500> wood

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
but I just thought that was pretty neat

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
don't like all the redstone wiring stuff

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.850 
don't like all the redstone wiring stuff
then<00:03:52.330> you<00:03:52.510> guys<00:03:52.660> can't<00:03:53.290> have<00:03:53.470> to<00:03:53.560> watch<00:03:53.710> this

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
then you guys can't have to watch this

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.410 
then you guys can't have to watch this
part<00:03:54.010> of<00:03:54.130> the<00:03:54.190> video<00:03:54.250> on<00:03:54.550> I'll<00:03:54.820> understand

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
part of the video on I'll understand

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:04.610 
part of the video on I'll understand
whoa<00:03:55.780> what<00:03:56.020> I<00:03:56.050> just<00:03:56.260> do<00:03:57.900> okay<00:04:00.930> and<00:04:01.930> thirsty

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.250 

anyway<00:04:06.180> so<00:04:07.180> I'm<00:04:07.540> just<00:04:07.690> going<00:04:07.810> to<00:04:07.870> explain<00:04:08.110> all

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
anyway so I'm just going to explain all

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.630 
anyway so I'm just going to explain all
this<00:04:08.320> for<00:04:08.440> instant<00:04:08.710> wiring<00:04:08.980> stuff<00:04:09.190> and<00:04:09.430> then

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
this for instant wiring stuff and then

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.120 
this for instant wiring stuff and then
that'll<00:04:09.880> be<00:04:09.910> the<00:04:10.030> end<00:04:10.090> of<00:04:10.210> the<00:04:10.300> video<00:04:10.360> so

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
that'll be the end of the video so

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.490 
that'll be the end of the video so
basically<00:04:12.130> your<00:04:12.760> buttons<00:04:13.060> up<00:04:13.180> there<00:04:13.360> it<00:04:14.230> comes

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
basically your buttons up there it comes

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.900 
basically your buttons up there it comes
down<00:04:14.680> here<00:04:14.890> and<00:04:15.070> best<00:04:15.250> I<00:04:15.400> will<00:04:15.580> latch<00:04:15.730> and

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
down here and best I will latch and

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.220 
down here and best I will latch and
right<00:04:16.060> now<00:04:16.150> it's<00:04:16.299> down<00:04:16.450> so<00:04:16.750> it's<00:04:16.870> on<00:04:16.959> the<00:04:17.080> down

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
right now it's down so it's on the down

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.770 
right now it's down so it's on the down
side<00:04:17.670> and<00:04:18.670> I'll<00:04:18.910> get<00:04:19.150> to<00:04:19.180> this<00:04:19.360> post<00:04:19.660> sir

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
side and I'll get to this post sir

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.630 
side and I'll get to this post sir
Maurice<00:04:19.959> I'm<00:04:20.080> going<00:04:20.350> to<00:04:20.410> a<00:04:20.440> pulse<00:04:20.739> to<00:04:21.489> this

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
Maurice I'm going to a pulse to this

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.340 
Maurice I'm going to a pulse to this
thing<00:04:21.850> right<00:04:22.000> here<00:04:22.030> which<00:04:22.810> is<00:04:22.930> called<00:04:23.110> a<00:04:23.170> state

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
thing right here which is called a state

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.800 
thing right here which is called a state
cell<00:04:23.560> by<00:04:23.680> the<00:04:23.740> way<00:04:23.890> just<00:04:24.610> sit<00:04:24.730> on<00:04:24.760> 3.3<00:04:25.390> seconds

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
cell by the way just sit on 3.3 seconds

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.050 
cell by the way just sit on 3.3 seconds
which<00:04:26.800> is<00:04:26.830> set<00:04:27.040> to<00:04:27.070> a<00:04:27.190> timer<00:04:27.460> with<00:04:27.730> this<00:04:27.880> thing

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
which is set to a timer with this thing

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.790 
which is set to a timer with this thing
in<00:04:28.180> it<00:04:28.300> and<00:04:28.450> we<00:04:28.510> want<00:04:28.690> this<00:04:28.780> to<00:04:28.840> take<00:04:29.200> four

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
in it and we want this to take four

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.240 
in it and we want this to take four
times<00:04:30.270> okay<00:04:31.270> and<00:04:31.510> then<00:04:32.170> it's<00:04:32.500> going<00:04:32.680> to<00:04:32.740> go<00:04:33.190> to

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
times okay and then it's going to go to

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.390 
times okay and then it's going to go to
the<00:04:33.610> elevator<00:04:34.090> down<00:04:34.360> command<00:04:35.070> for<00:04:36.070> just<00:04:36.250> right

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
the elevator down command for just right

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.100 
the elevator down command for just right
over<00:04:36.520> here<00:04:36.940> I<00:04:37.090> just<00:04:37.450> makes<00:04:37.600> it<00:04:37.660> a<00:04:37.720> lot<00:04:37.870> easier

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
over here I just makes it a lot easier

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.990 
over here I just makes it a lot easier
to<00:04:38.500> wire<00:04:38.770> up<00:04:38.800> with<00:04:39.190> the<00:04:39.340> while<00:04:39.520> if<00:04:39.670> I'd<00:04:39.760> stone

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
to wire up with the while if I'd stone

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.600 
to wire up with the while if I'd stone
by<00:04:40.150> the<00:04:40.180> way<00:04:40.360> you<00:04:40.660> don't<00:04:41.080> have<00:04:41.170> to<00:04:41.320> have<00:04:41.560> it<00:04:41.610> but

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
by the way you don't have to have it but

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.080 
by the way you don't have to have it but
it<00:04:42.700> makes<00:04:42.850> it<00:04:43.030> so<00:04:43.240> much<00:04:43.300> easier<00:04:43.420> and<00:04:44.880> then<00:04:45.880> this

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
it makes it so much easier and then this

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.180 
it makes it so much easier and then this
is<00:04:46.240> the<00:04:46.270> piston<00:04:46.720> right<00:04:46.870> here<00:04:47.050> so<00:04:47.920> whenever

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
is the piston right here so whenever

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.570 
is the piston right here so whenever
that's<00:04:48.520> triggered<00:04:49.860> it<00:04:50.860> gets<00:04:51.160> it<00:04:51.280> right<00:04:51.400> here

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
that's triggered it gets it right here

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.240 
that's triggered it gets it right here
to<00:04:51.730> another<00:04:51.850> tug<00:04:52.120> allege<00:04:52.390> that<00:04:52.690> will<00:04:53.380> push

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
to another tug allege that will push

00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:00.090 
to another tug allege that will push
listen<00:04:54.670> up<00:04:55.110> and<00:04:56.790> this<00:04:57.790> side<00:04:58.150> right<00:04:58.180> here<00:04:59.100> it's

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
listen up and this side right here it's

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.940 
listen up and this side right here it's
just<00:05:00.460> that<00:05:01.230> basically<00:05:02.230> the<00:05:02.380> same<00:05:02.500> thing<00:05:02.560> but

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
just that basically the same thing but

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.580 
just that basically the same thing but
it<00:05:03.700> only<00:05:03.880> takes<00:05:04.150> twice<00:05:04.450> or<00:05:04.870> maybe<00:05:04.990> a<00:05:05.140> few<00:05:05.350> times

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
it only takes twice or maybe a few times

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.940 
it only takes twice or maybe a few times
for<00:05:05.890> ya<00:05:06.520> three<00:05:06.880> times<00:05:07.090> and<00:05:07.500> that's<00:05:08.500> for<00:05:08.740> the<00:05:08.770> up

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
for ya three times and that's for the up

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.320 
for ya three times and that's for the up
and<00:05:09.840> then<00:05:10.840> it<00:05:10.960> hits<00:05:11.710> the<00:05:11.860> piston<00:05:12.250> before<00:05:12.970> it

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
and then it hits the piston before it

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.970 
and then it hits the piston before it
actually<00:05:13.480> ever<00:05:13.900> does<00:05:14.050> anything<00:05:14.080> so<00:05:14.620> it<00:05:14.710> opens

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980 
actually ever does anything so it opens

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.380 
actually ever does anything so it opens
it<00:05:15.100> up<00:05:15.160> before<00:05:15.370> it<00:05:15.520> tries<00:05:15.669> to<00:05:15.790> go<00:05:16.000> up<00:05:16.470> so<00:05:17.470> I<00:05:18.390> can

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:19.390 
it up before it tries to go up so I can

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.000 
it up before it tries to go up so I can
show<00:05:19.570> you<00:05:19.630> is<00:05:19.810> it<00:05:19.990> right<00:05:20.140> now<00:05:20.290> just<00:05:20.650> working

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
show you is it right now just working

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:26.390 
show you is it right now just working
underneath<00:05:21.190> and<00:05:21.640> then<00:05:23.220> down<00:05:24.220> again<00:05:24.250> would<00:05:24.700> be

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
underneath and then down again would be

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.670 
underneath and then down again would be
just<00:05:27.400> like<00:05:27.550> that<00:05:27.760> it's<00:05:28.000> nothing<00:05:28.150> too

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
just like that it's nothing too

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.630 
just like that it's nothing too
complicated<00:05:30.750> so<00:05:31.750> i<00:05:32.230> might<00:05:32.830> do<00:05:33.010> torial<00:05:33.400> in<00:05:33.460> it<00:05:33.550> I

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:33.640 
complicated so i might do torial in it I

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.010 
complicated so i might do torial in it I
might<00:05:34.120> not<00:05:34.270> I'm<00:05:34.540> not<00:05:35.050> sure

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
might not I'm not sure

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.950 
might not I'm not sure
I<00:05:36.560> get<00:05:37.520> enough<00:05:37.699> comments<00:05:38.210> and<00:05:38.360> likes<00:05:38.509> and
