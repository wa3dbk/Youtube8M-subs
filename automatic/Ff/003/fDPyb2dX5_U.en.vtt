00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.670
 hi girls and guys how are you 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:10.230
 welcome to a new video in the video 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.580
 today I 'm going to advance some of 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.349
 those trends that we're going to see this 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.389
 spring-summer I hope I'm not late 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.009
 and with this video I announce that there will be 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.630
 another video also with essentials 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.790
 to make it even easier for you 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.500
 of shopping trends in this 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.970
 season as always there are more things 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.860
 new this season and others that 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.450
 continue from previous seasons as 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.189
 for example the theme of sports and 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.689
 still carried much sport if 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.759
 before they were the new balance this year are 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.860
 the stan smith new to the one so 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.600
 another the tendency that reaches a little 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.770
 but well there we have it today yes that 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.150
 I'm going to talk about the ones that have most influenced me 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.770
 called to my attention or those who see 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.570
 more interesting results we are going to 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.180
 start with a country that inspires this 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.550
 season with japan in particular with a 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.710
 garment that sessa gabardine that remembers 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.450
 to a kimono or a robe to walk by 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.790
 house 'a very light gabardine that 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.410
 we usually see a belt 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.800
 some examples on the catwalk as 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.450
 this one of loeb or this one of his is not 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.910
 who also took out this other version 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.619
 beige with that belt knotted in a 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.509
 side has that example of 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.890
 this trend with these two examples 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:09.100
 that I teach you and finally this 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.630
 gabardine of 3 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.220
 and I tell you that I have done with a 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.380
 gabardine of that style that in particular 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.030
 is this that you see here of its target is 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.380
 a barrier as you see very light in this 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.940
 Case a green color with this belt 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.619
 but the influence of culture 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.330
 Japanese does not stay in that but 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.000
 the belts also come a lot 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.830
 the beavers that are those belts more 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.810
 chubby or belts that remind us 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.720
 to the typical belts of the arts 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.250
 taekwondo judo martial for 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.450
 example I have a new video that is this 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.190
 I showed you that it is the spanish and 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.840
 sisters, you usually spend it like that 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.340
 around the waist on the catwalk 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.020
 You can see some examples of these 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.630
 belts that I mention for example in 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.009
 visible and you see here a few as 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.479
 they have knotted in a very curious way 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.039
 on the side that remembers those 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.479
 belts as I tell you about arts 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:51.310
 martial is also what I liked 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.300
 very much the bet of the over we go to 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.300
 do a little bit of homeland 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.060
 do not come out you can also see that he has 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.350
 taken out rebecca taylor has also taken off 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.650
 some examples of these belts 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.450
 as you can see in short 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.490
 we return to mark that area of â€‹â€‹the waist 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.320
 with the help of a belt we continue with 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.090
 a silhouette that stands out that is to leave the 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.530
 shoulder to the air the truth is that I do not 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.750
 I practice them a lot but you have to 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.670
 say it's very seductive let's see 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.860
 some examples of catwalk with jill 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.650
 stuart you see this top so nice dress 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.240
 another ideal top and this kind of monkey 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.250
 roll floren has also shown off 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.820
 quite with several tops and also with 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.820
 dresses 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.970
 and tania taylor to finish with this 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.470
 printed top we continue with a pattern 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.240
 that is devastating that are the pictures 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.130
 of vinci I already taught in a day and 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.870
 this little dress that I bought in primark 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.970
 of these eggs in black and white what 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.290
 let's see in a thousand different formats and 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.030
 on the catwalk we have seen him hand in hand 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.430
 of fast height of this dress what 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.020
 beautiful and these others also in the form of 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.180
 top and fit jacket suit 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.890
 diane von fustenberg has also seen it 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.690
 look at prettier things in all 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.670
 versions as I say oscar of the rent 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.290
 has not been left behind in a box a 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.290
 little bit bigger but very funny 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.760
 the bohemian airs inspired by 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.249
 marrakech we see them in the form of a dress 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.530
 a light romantic long dress 

00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:11.519
 Bohemian I have loved the proposals 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.680
 that we have seen on the catwalk 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.689
 we started with alberta ferretti and these 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.030
 dresses so in dreamers we continue with 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:20.159
 dries go notice with these other two 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.329
 Valentino dresses I loved it 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:23.519
 They have looked like dresses 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:26.010
 spectacular that reflect a lot 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.569
 this trend and finally you will see wang 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.900
 she has also taken out dresses from this 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:32.579
 style and talking about prints like 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.230
 We were talking from the Vichy paintings 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.730
 another pattern that comes are the flowers 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.439
 as you always say but this time 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.389
 the flowers are no longer tiny but 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:41.069
 they are maxi flowers and I mean 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:42.750
 cool prints like this one for example 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:45.599
 from michael kors that you can see in this 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.250
 ad here in the vogue magazine you see 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:49.109
 that the color is more beautiful yes that flowers 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.269
 more giants here is the cheese taught 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:53.219
 in the magazine and also marni has done 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.650
 that bet on big flowers sometimes 

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:57.569
 a little abstract even from the 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.180
 same way that carolina challenges with these 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.709
 maximum booths another fabric that comes 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.659
 much that also had not been for a long time 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.459
 we saw is before I know that art is 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:06.600
 a somewhat special fabric in this 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.850
 occasion apart 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.830
 classic suede in a brown color 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.840
 toasting even beige well the suede in 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.300
 multiple colors let's see some 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.860
 examples like these from pucci that you see the 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.570
 traditional color that told you but a 

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.489
 color also fuchsia buzzi also 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.590
 bet on the color brown although we see 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.420
 these red tones like in this case and 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.680
 loeb to costs by colors also a 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.660
 little getting out of the range 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.860
 traditional as you can observe and 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.840
 talk about before takes us 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.390
 inevitably to talk about the return of 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.920
 the 70s is one of the great 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.470
 trends of the season that's why we're going 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.390
 to see many bell- bottom pants 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.940
 Wide blouses Many fringed hats 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:44.250
 funny prints a little daring 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.560
 let's say here you have some pants 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.270
 batman bell-shaped sant laurent has 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.670
 removed platforms that is typical 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.580
 also from the 70s and we can see 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:55.200
 also in the classic stores where 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.810
 we consume habitually as 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.120
 can these be these sets that we 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.830
 remember being the roll of the 70s and 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.600
 of this last image with fringes 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.310
 we inevitably jump to this element 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.680
 decorative that are the fringes that 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.970
 let's see very present this season 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.740
 and that we have also seen it in ways 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.270
 very interesting on the catwalk I 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.520
 love how it incorporates alberta 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.800
 and this element in your parade and for 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.930
 course the cowboy fabric is still 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.970
 the king with two particularities in this 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.920
 occasion we are going to see on the one hand a 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.410
 no tissue and very broad as with 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.720
 a lot of space is no longer a tight or 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.970
 adjusted we can see it in the parade of 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.430
 adams the sea â€‹â€‹and also in the karen 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:34.380
 walker but without going very far in the 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.660
 same zara we have a lot of garments 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.950
 that as you can see are much wider and 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.200
 less adjusted than we are 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:42.060
 accustomed to seeing and the other novelty 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.310
 that detected in the denim is that in the 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.290
 same garment two colors of 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.970
 denim that contrast this contrast what 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:50.450
 you can see in these examples of the parade 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.450
 from gucci 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.650
 and believe me I assure you and many more 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.060
 trends but I do not want to cover 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.889
 all because as I tell you to see a 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.810
 second video with 10 essentials of 

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:05.460
 the season where expand this 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.620
 information I hope you liked it 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.210
 I would be very happy that if you 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.800
 liked where you have little fingers up 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.870
 that those who are not subscribed to me 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.699
 channel or subscribe and of course now 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.900
 I'm going to leave you with two other videos that 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:18.360
 are very inspired by trends 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.949
 one is how to get a dress a top 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.539
 style altuzarra that I taught you now 

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:23.819
 in this video and in the other is how 

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:25.020
 get a burberry style jacket 

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:27.330
 either of the two sure gives you 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.009
 ideas to look very in trend this 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.969
 spring-summer thank you very much and we 

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:31.969
 we see in the following video
