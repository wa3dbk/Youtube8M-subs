00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.610 

in<00:00:00.240> these<00:00:00.480> problems<00:00:00.930> were<00:00:01.079> being<00:00:01.319> asked<00:00:01.589> to

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
in these problems were being asked to

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.350 
in these problems were being asked to
figure<00:00:01.920> out<00:00:02.070> the<00:00:02.159> average<00:00:02.310> of<00:00:02.879> a<00:00:03.030> group<00:00:03.210> of

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
figure out the average of a group of

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.619 
figure out the average of a group of
numbers<00:00:03.689> and<00:00:03.929> the<00:00:04.920> average<00:00:05.310> represents<00:00:05.970> some

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
numbers and the average represents some

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.009 
numbers and the average represents some
point<00:00:07.529> that's<00:00:08.010> in<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:09.059> middle<00:00:09.420> of<00:00:09.599> this<00:00:09.809> group

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
point that's in the middle of this group

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.629 
point that's in the middle of this group
of<00:00:10.200> numbers<00:00:10.380> so<00:00:11.010> if<00:00:11.099> you<00:00:11.190> were<00:00:11.280> to<00:00:11.370> stretch

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
of numbers so if you were to stretch

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.200 
of numbers so if you were to stretch
them<00:00:11.880> out<00:00:11.969> on<00:00:12.150> a<00:00:12.240> number<00:00:12.420> line<00:00:12.599> say<00:00:14.210> here's

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
them out on a number line say here's

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.890 
them out on a number line say here's
seven<00:00:15.750> here's<00:00:16.379> 8<00:00:17.359> 9<00:00:18.359> 10<00:00:19.050> 11<00:00:19.550> 12<00:00:20.550> there's<00:00:20.970> 12<00:00:21.330> if

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
seven here's 8 9 10 11 12 there's 12 if

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.220 
seven here's 8 9 10 11 12 there's 12 if
you<00:00:22.470> were<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.710> pick<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:22.980> point<00:00:23.220> that<00:00:23.519> somewhere

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
you were to pick a point that somewhere

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.830 
you were to pick a point that somewhere
represents<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.350> middle<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:25.949> these<00:00:26.480> with<00:00:27.480> each

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
represents the middle of these with each

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.990 
represents the middle of these with each
number<00:00:28.199> having<00:00:28.619> sort<00:00:29.070> of<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.189> same<00:00:29.400> weight<00:00:29.820> or

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
number having sort of the same weight or

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.759 
number having sort of the same weight or
pull<00:00:30.300> on<00:00:30.330> where<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.840> middle<00:00:31.109> is<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.650> would

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
pull on where the middle is you would

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.830 
pull on where the middle is you would
expect<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.340> be<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:32.759> know<00:00:32.910> somewhere

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
expect it to be you know somewhere

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.540 
expect it to be you know somewhere
closer<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.620> seven<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.070> eight<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.219> the

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
closer to the seven and eight and the

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.459 
closer to the seven and eight and the
twelve<00:00:35.910> because<00:00:36.660> there's<00:00:36.989> two<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.230> them<00:00:37.350> down

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
twelve because there's two of them down

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.229 
twelve because there's two of them down
here<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.739> only<00:00:37.980> one<00:00:38.190> up<00:00:38.309> here<00:00:38.340> so<00:00:38.670> it'd<00:00:39.090> be

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
here and only one up here so it'd be

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.660 
here and only one up here so it'd be
somewhere<00:00:39.600> in<00:00:39.840> there<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:41.010> way<00:00:41.190> we<00:00:41.370> figured

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
somewhere in there the way we figured

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.060 
somewhere in there the way we figured
this<00:00:41.790> out<00:00:41.969> mathematically<00:00:42.899> is<00:00:43.079> we<00:00:43.320> add<00:00:43.559> them

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
this out mathematically is we add them

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.340 
this out mathematically is we add them
together<00:00:45.110> so<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.140> add<00:00:46.379> all<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.890> numbers<00:00:46.920> and

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
together so you add all the numbers and

00:00:48.350 --> 00:01:01.270 
together so you add all the numbers and
then<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.590> divide<00:00:52.100> by<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.610> number<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:56.120> numbers

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.450 

in<00:01:02.280> this<00:01:02.489> case<00:01:02.730> we<00:01:03.090> would<00:01:03.239> say<00:01:03.539> 7<00:01:04.140> plus<00:01:04.589> 8<00:01:04.830> plus

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
in this case we would say 7 plus 8 plus

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.340 
in this case we would say 7 plus 8 plus
12<00:01:06.680> divided<00:01:07.680> by<00:01:07.710> 3<00:01:08.960> because<00:01:09.960> there<00:01:10.140> are<00:01:10.200> three

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
12 divided by 3 because there are three

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.999 
12 divided by 3 because there are three
numbers<00:01:11.090> and<00:01:12.090> 7<00:01:12.479> plus<00:01:12.689> 8<00:01:12.900> plus<00:01:12.930> 12<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:14.630> 27<00:01:16.009> and

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
numbers and 7 plus 8 plus 12 is 27 and

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.390 
numbers and 7 plus 8 plus 12 is 27 and
if<00:01:17.130> we<00:01:17.250> divide<00:01:17.549> that<00:01:17.729> by<00:01:17.939> 3<00:01:18.270> we<00:01:19.200> get<00:01:19.350> 9<00:01:19.740> so

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
if we divide that by 3 we get 9 so

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.399 
if we divide that by 3 we get 9 so
there's<00:01:20.820> our<00:01:21.060> average<00:01:21.479> right<00:01:21.689> there<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.110> just

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
there's our average right there and just

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.840 
there's our average right there and just
as<00:01:22.530> we<00:01:22.650> thought<00:01:22.830> it's<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.100> little<00:01:23.430> closer<00:01:23.610> to

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
as we thought it's a little closer to

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.620 
as we thought it's a little closer to
the<00:01:23.970> 7<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.360> 8<00:01:24.450> than<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.780> 12<00:01:25.049> and<00:01:25.290> it's<00:01:25.740> between

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
the 7 and 8 than the 12 and it's between

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.160 
the 7 and 8 than the 12 and it's between
the<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.960> high<00:01:28.140> number<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.710> low<00:01:28.829> numbers

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
the the high number and the low numbers

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.039 
the the high number and the low numbers
let's<00:01:31.170> do<00:01:31.320> one<00:01:31.470> more<00:01:32.240> this<00:01:33.240> one<00:01:33.479> says<00:01:33.689> what<00:01:33.960> is

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
let's do one more this one says what is

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.730 
let's do one more this one says what is
the<00:01:34.140> average<00:01:34.259> of<00:01:34.530> 15<00:01:35.340> for<00:01:35.909> 14<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:36.840> 11<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.560> just

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
the average of 15 for 14 and 11 and just

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.469 
the average of 15 for 14 and 11 and just
you<00:01:37.979> know<00:01:38.100> so<00:01:38.280> we<00:01:38.369> get<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.640> look<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.299> don't

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
you know so we get the look you don't

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.910 
you know so we get the look you don't
have<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.869> make<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.049> number<00:01:40.290> line<00:01:40.439> when<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:40.799> do

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
have to make a number line when you do

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.319 
have to make a number line when you do
these<00:01:41.070> problems<00:01:41.490> but<00:01:41.579> sometimes<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.000> helps<00:01:42.090> to

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
these problems but sometimes it helps to

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.330 
these problems but sometimes it helps to
visualize<00:01:42.360> them<00:01:42.930> if<00:01:43.350> we<00:01:43.530> have<00:01:43.649> 4<00:01:43.979> over<00:01:44.310> here

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
visualize them if we have 4 over here

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:52.700 
visualize them if we have 4 over here
and<00:01:44.880> let's<00:01:45.840> see<00:01:46.020> 5<00:01:46.380> 6<00:01:46.829> 7<00:01:47.280> 8<00:01:47.899> 9<00:01:48.899> 10<00:01:49.320> 11<00:01:49.579> here<00:01:51.140> 12<00:01:52.140> 13

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
and let's see 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 here 12 13

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.289 
and let's see 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 here 12 13
14<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.689> 15<00:01:55.159> so<00:01:56.159> we<00:01:56.280> got<00:01:56.399> one<00:01:56.670> number<00:01:56.850> way<00:01:57.119> down

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
14 and 15 so we got one number way down

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.179 
14 and 15 so we got one number way down
here<00:01:57.719> we've<00:01:57.960> got<00:01:58.079> more<00:01:58.350> numbers<00:01:58.799> that<00:01:58.979> are<00:01:59.070> up

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
here we've got more numbers that are up

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.740 
here we've got more numbers that are up
here<00:01:59.460> it's<00:01:59.579> going<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.850> be<00:02:00.030> an<00:02:00.299> average<00:02:00.509> is

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
here it's going to be an average is

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.899 
here it's going to be an average is
going<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:00.960> be<00:02:01.049> somewhere<00:02:01.409> in<00:02:01.680> this<00:02:02.369> range<00:02:02.670> in

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
going to be somewhere in this range in

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.069 
going to be somewhere in this range in
here<00:02:04.250> but<00:02:05.250> we<00:02:05.369> can<00:02:05.490> figure<00:02:05.670> out<00:02:05.759> exactly<00:02:06.540> by

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
here but we can figure out exactly by

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.330 
here but we can figure out exactly by
adding<00:02:07.530> 4<00:02:07.920> plus<00:02:08.429> 11<00:02:09.030> plus<00:02:09.209> 14<00:02:10.080> plus<00:02:10.379> 15<00:02:11.099> and

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
adding 4 plus 11 plus 14 plus 15 and

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.860 
adding 4 plus 11 plus 14 plus 15 and
this<00:02:12.090> time<00:02:12.330> we<00:02:12.840> divide<00:02:13.200> by

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
this time we divide by

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.080 
this time we divide by
for<00:02:14.530> we're<00:02:14.920> always<00:02:15.040> dividing<00:02:15.430> by<00:02:15.520> the<00:02:15.580> number

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
for we're always dividing by the number

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.960 
for we're always dividing by the number
of<00:02:16.120> numbers<00:02:16.630> that<00:02:16.660> there<00:02:16.900> are<00:02:17.670> on<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.790> top

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
of numbers that there are on the top

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.920 
of numbers that there are on the top
here<00:02:19.270> and<00:02:19.420> let's<00:02:20.290> see<00:02:20.440> 4<00:02:20.860> plus<00:02:21.400> 11<00:02:22.000> plus<00:02:22.270> 14

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
here and let's see 4 plus 11 plus 14

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.720 
here and let's see 4 plus 11 plus 14
plus<00:02:22.959> 15<00:02:23.940> that's<00:02:24.940> 44<00:02:26.340> struck<00:02:27.340> write<00:02:27.580> that

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
plus 15 that's 44 struck write that

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.710 
plus 15 that's 44 struck write that
correctly<00:02:28.000> 44<00:02:28.569> and<00:02:28.780> 44<00:02:29.650> divided<00:02:30.130> by<00:02:30.310> 4<00:02:30.580> is<00:02:30.819> 11

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
correctly 44 and 44 divided by 4 is 11

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.960 
correctly 44 and 44 divided by 4 is 11
so<00:02:32.709> the<00:02:32.860> average<00:02:33.040> of<00:02:33.400> these<00:02:33.489> numbers<00:02:33.849> is

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
so the average of these numbers is

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.300 
so the average of these numbers is
actually<00:02:34.630> 11<00:02:36.330> last<00:02:37.330> one<00:02:37.599> this<00:02:38.560> one<00:02:38.769> says<00:02:38.980> what

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
actually 11 last one this one says what

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.630 
actually 11 last one this one says what
is<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.550> number<00:02:39.790> halfway<00:02:40.390> between<00:02:41.110> 7<00:02:41.769> and<00:02:41.980> 33

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
is the number halfway between 7 and 33

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.370 
is the number halfway between 7 and 33
and<00:02:42.819> at<00:02:42.910> first<00:02:43.030> this<00:02:43.239> may<00:02:43.599> not<00:02:43.780> seem<00:02:44.019> like<00:02:44.230> it's

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
and at first this may not seem like it's

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.289 
and at first this may not seem like it's
an<00:02:44.470> average<00:02:44.680> question<00:02:45.310> but<00:02:45.910> it's<00:02:46.030> really

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
an average question but it's really

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:47.820 
an average question but it's really
asking<00:02:46.840> the<00:02:46.959> same<00:02:47.170> thing

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
asking the same thing

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.020 
asking the same thing
so<00:02:48.459> if<00:02:48.640> 7<00:02:49.120> is<00:02:49.239> down<00:02:49.420> here<00:02:49.900> and<00:02:50.190> 33<00:02:51.190> is<00:02:51.310> up<00:02:51.489> here

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
so if 7 is down here and 33 is up here

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.539 
so if 7 is down here and 33 is up here
what's<00:02:52.690> the<00:02:52.870> number<00:02:52.959> that's<00:02:53.200> halfway<00:02:53.470> well

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
what's the number that's halfway well

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:56.610 
what's the number that's halfway well
when<00:02:55.269> and<00:02:55.420> there's<00:02:55.569> only<00:02:55.690> two<00:02:55.810> numbers<00:02:56.380> if<00:02:56.590> you

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
when and there's only two numbers if you

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.380 
when and there's only two numbers if you
take<00:02:56.920> the<00:02:57.069> average<00:02:57.580> of<00:02:57.730> those<00:02:57.850> two<00:02:57.910> numbers

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
take the average of those two numbers

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.089 
take the average of those two numbers
you<00:02:58.569> get<00:02:58.720> the<00:02:58.840> number<00:02:59.170> that<00:02:59.349> is<00:02:59.560> halfway

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
you get the number that is halfway

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.430 
you get the number that is halfway
between<00:03:00.250> them<00:03:00.519> right<00:03:00.700> in<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:00.880> middle<00:03:01.440> so

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
between them right in the middle so

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.199 
between them right in the middle so
we'll<00:03:02.620> compute<00:03:03.310> this<00:03:03.549> just<00:03:03.819> the<00:03:03.910> way<00:03:03.940> we<00:03:04.120> did

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
we'll compute this just the way we did

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:05.610 
we'll compute this just the way we did
the<00:03:04.330> other<00:03:04.480> ones<00:03:04.540> we'll<00:03:04.840> add<00:03:05.019> the<00:03:05.349> numbers

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
the other ones we'll add the numbers

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.550 
the other ones we'll add the numbers
together<00:03:05.799> and<00:03:06.900> then<00:03:07.900> we'll<00:03:08.019> divide<00:03:08.319> by<00:03:08.500> the

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
together and then we'll divide by the

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.710 
together and then we'll divide by the
number<00:03:08.769> of<00:03:09.040> numbers<00:03:09.370> that<00:03:09.400> there<00:03:09.670> are<00:03:09.790> there

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
number of numbers that there are there

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.729 
number of numbers that there are there
are<00:03:10.750> two<00:03:10.920> 7<00:03:11.920> plus<00:03:12.130> 33<00:03:12.459> is<00:03:12.849> 40<00:03:13.360> 40<00:03:14.230> divided<00:03:14.590> by<00:03:14.620> 2

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
are two 7 plus 33 is 40 40 divided by 2

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.770 
are two 7 plus 33 is 40 40 divided by 2
is<00:03:14.980> 20<00:03:15.400> so<00:03:15.910> the<00:03:16.060> number<00:03:16.299> that<00:03:16.420> is<00:03:16.540> halfway

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
is 20 so the number that is halfway

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.630 
is 20 so the number that is halfway
between<00:03:16.959> 7<00:03:17.560> and<00:03:17.739> 33<00:03:18.190> is<00:03:19.180> 20<00:03:20.040> so<00:03:21.040> that's<00:03:21.310> some

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
between 7 and 33 is 20 so that's some

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.870 
between 7 and 33 is 20 so that's some
work<00:03:21.820> with<00:03:22.090> averages
