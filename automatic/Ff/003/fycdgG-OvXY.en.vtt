this next step you have to do quickly or
you'll<00:01:09.570> die<00:01:09.870> jump<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.860> back<00:01:11.040> wing<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.460> the

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
you'll die jump to the back wing of the

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.490 
you'll die jump to the back wing of the
plane<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.060> then<00:01:12.240> turn<00:01:12.630> around<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:13.020> jump<00:01:13.320> to

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
plane and then turn around and jump to

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.840 
plane and then turn around and jump to
the<00:01:13.530> center<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.010> plane<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.460> keep<00:01:14.670> tapping

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
the center of the plane and keep tapping

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.930 
the center of the plane and keep tapping
in<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.420> can<00:01:15.540> do<00:01:15.660> a<00:01:15.690> double<00:01:16.050> jump<00:01:16.610> then<00:01:17.610> make

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
in so you can do a double jump then make

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.280 
in so you can do a double jump then make
your<00:01:18.090> way<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.480> roof<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.870> building<00:01:19.020> and
