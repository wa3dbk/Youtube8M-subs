tweeter<00:02:14.849> tell<00:02:15.629> us<00:02:15.750> a<00:02:15.780> little<00:02:15.870> bit<00:02:16.020> about<00:02:16.110> the

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
tweeter tell us a little bit about the

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.979 
tweeter tell us a little bit about the
preamp<00:02:16.770> on<00:02:16.950> this<00:02:17.129> this<00:02:17.700> yeah<00:02:18.390> this<00:02:18.540> is<00:02:18.780> two

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
preamp on this this yeah this is two

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.050 
preamp on this this yeah this is two
separate<00:02:19.319> channels<00:02:19.709> and<00:02:19.920> it's<00:02:20.040> looks<00:02:20.550> you

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
separate channels and it's looks you

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.369 
separate channels and it's looks you
know<00:02:21.150> like<00:02:21.180> there's<00:02:21.540> several<00:02:21.720> knobs<00:02:22.020> here<00:02:22.200> but

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
know like there's several knobs here but

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.110 
know like there's several knobs here but
that's<00:02:22.470> channel<00:02:22.920> one<00:02:23.099> and<00:02:23.340> then<00:02:23.910> this<00:02:24.000> is

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
that's channel one and then this is

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.720 
that's channel one and then this is
channel<00:02:24.510> 2<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:25.260> in<00:02:25.620> that<00:02:25.860> you've<00:02:26.040> got<00:02:26.250> a

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
channel 2 and in that you've got a

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.270 
channel 2 and in that you've got a
quarter<00:02:27.120> inch<00:02:27.270> input<00:02:27.450> for<00:02:27.810> one<00:02:28.020> an<00:02:28.319> XLR<00:02:29.220> and

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
quarter inch input for one an XLR and

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.040 
quarter inch input for one an XLR and
quarter-inch<00:02:29.819> input<00:02:30.180> for<00:02:30.330> number<00:02:30.540> two<00:02:30.720> so<00:02:30.870> if

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
quarter-inch input for number two so if

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.990 
quarter-inch input for number two so if
you're<00:02:31.200> at<00:02:31.290> coffee<00:02:31.530> shop<00:02:31.830> get<00:02:32.069> on<00:02:32.160> plug<00:02:32.879> your

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
you're at coffee shop get on plug your

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.940 
you're at coffee shop get on plug your
guitar<00:02:33.060> in<00:02:33.540> channel<00:02:34.080> one<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.290> then<00:02:34.650> your<00:02:34.769> mic

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
guitar in channel one and then your mic

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.280 
guitar in channel one and then your mic
in<00:02:35.129> jail<00:02:35.400> -<00:02:35.610> and<00:02:35.640> this<00:02:36.030> rocket<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:36.930> then<00:02:37.170> we

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
in jail - and this rocket and then we

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.869 
in jail - and this rocket and then we
have<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.680> digital<00:02:38.099> effects<00:02:38.430> there's<00:02:38.790> a

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
have the digital effects there's a

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.880 
have the digital effects there's a
business<00:02:39.720> on<00:02:39.870> that<00:02:40.019> this<00:02:40.140> is<00:02:40.260> on<00:02:40.379> the<00:02:40.440> master

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
business on that this is on the master

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:41.330 
business on that this is on the master
right

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
right

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.009 
right
so<00:02:41.519> everything<00:02:42.000> that<00:02:42.030> goes<00:02:42.300> out<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:42.660> gets<00:02:42.780> the

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
so everything that goes out and gets the

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.509 
so everything that goes out and gets the
effect<00:02:43.319> yeah<00:02:43.530> well<00:02:43.709> you<00:02:43.830> can<00:02:44.010> choose<00:02:44.280> it<00:02:44.489> in

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
effect yeah well you can choose it in

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.430 
effect yeah well you can choose it in
channel<00:02:45.060> water<00:02:45.239> channel<00:02:45.690> -<00:02:45.840> you<00:02:46.110> can<00:02:46.290> have<00:02:46.410> a

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
channel water channel - you can have a

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.350 
channel water channel - you can have a
channel<00:02:46.860> dry<00:02:47.099> okay<00:02:47.340> so<00:02:47.400> there<00:02:47.730> is<00:02:47.760> a<00:02:47.910> there<00:02:48.330> is

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
channel dry okay so there is a there is

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.869 
channel dry okay so there is a there is
a<00:02:48.480> effects<00:02:49.379> extra<00:02:49.769> level<00:02:50.069> for<00:02:50.370> each<00:02:50.519> channel

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
a effects extra level for each channel

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.960 
a effects extra level for each channel
exactly<00:02:51.360> and<00:02:51.660> all<00:02:52.500> of<00:02:52.680> our<00:02:52.819> performance<00:02:53.819> and

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
exactly and all of our performance and

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.610 
exactly and all of our performance and
professional<00:02:54.480> level<00:02:54.750> acoustic<00:02:55.170> amps<00:02:55.470> you've

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
professional level acoustic amps you've

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.619 
professional level acoustic amps you've
got<00:02:55.800> a<00:02:56.010> phase<00:02:56.430> reserve<00:02:56.819> a<00:02:57.000> reverse<00:02:57.330> switch

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
got a phase reserve a reverse switch

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:59.089 
got a phase reserve a reverse switch
right<00:02:58.019> so<00:02:58.200> that's<00:02:58.290> critical<00:02:58.590> if<00:02:59.010> you

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
right so that's critical if you

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.320 
right so that's critical if you
competing<00:02:59.580> with<00:02:59.640> somebody<00:03:00.060> and<00:03:00.209> you're

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
competing with somebody and you're

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.420 
competing with somebody and you're
missing<00:03:00.510> some<00:03:00.810> overtones<00:03:01.230> exactly<00:03:01.980> well<00:03:02.159> just

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
missing some overtones exactly well just

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.970 
missing some overtones exactly well just
as<00:03:02.760> a<00:03:02.790> feedback<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:03.870> limiter<00:03:04.319> really<00:03:04.650> helps

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
as a feedback the limiter really helps

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.280 
as a feedback the limiter really helps
in<00:03:05.129> that<00:03:05.370> Rumble<00:03:06.209> you<00:03:06.360> might<00:03:06.540> hear<00:03:06.840> depending

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
in that Rumble you might hear depending

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.720 
in that Rumble you might hear depending
on<00:03:07.440> the<00:03:07.530> warrior<00:03:07.800> point<00:03:08.040> ways<00:03:08.220> to<00:03:08.370> stack<00:03:08.580> up

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
features like the little kickback

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.960 
features like the little kickback
handout<00:03:13.620> here<00:03:13.950> tips<00:03:14.489> it<00:03:14.670> up<00:03:14.790> towards<00:03:15.180> you<00:03:15.300> and

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
it's important to have an act real quick

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.520 
it's important to have an act real quick
yeah<00:03:18.700> I<00:03:18.730> often<00:03:19.300> tell<00:03:19.480> people<00:03:19.510> judge<00:03:20.170> all<00:03:20.410> of

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
yeah I often tell people judge all of

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.350 
yeah I often tell people judge all of
our<00:03:20.650> amplifiers<00:03:21.130> by<00:03:21.370> the<00:03:21.430> rear<00:03:21.640> panel<00:03:21.880> right

our amplifiers by the rear panel right

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.790 
our amplifiers by the rear panel right
because<00:03:22.600> there's<00:03:22.780> so<00:03:22.930> many<00:03:23.080> features<00:03:23.560> back

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
because there's so many features back

and<00:03:29.740> you<00:03:29.800> could<00:03:30.100> run<00:03:30.310> this<00:03:30.490> also<00:03:31.000> is<00:03:31.210> just<00:03:31.540> a<00:03:31.720> DI

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
and you could run this also is just a DI

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
this as a DI box right and it's safe to

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.150 
this as a DI box right and it's safe to
run<00:03:37.720> it<00:03:37.870> with<00:03:37.990> the<00:03:38.140> speed<00:03:38.500> your<00:03:38.650> own<00:03:38.770> flow<00:03:38.980> all

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
run it with the speed your own flow all
