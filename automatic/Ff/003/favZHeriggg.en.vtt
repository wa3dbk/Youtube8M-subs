good<00:03:59.269> from<00:03:59.450> this<00:03:59.540> angle<00:03:59.720> but<00:04:00.019> uh<00:04:00.079> they're<00:04:01.040> not

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
good from this angle but uh they're not

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.160 
good from this angle but uh they're not
they're<00:04:01.880> not<00:04:01.910> that<00:04:02.120> great<00:04:02.269> they're<00:04:03.079> probably

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
they're not that great they're probably

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.660 
they're not that great they're probably
one<00:04:03.410> of<00:04:03.440> my<00:04:03.500> weakest<00:04:03.950> muscle<00:04:04.100> groups<00:04:04.430> so

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
one of my weakest muscle groups so

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.620 
one of my weakest muscle groups so
something<00:04:05.060> to<00:04:05.150> focus<00:04:05.239> on<00:04:05.510> for<00:04:05.690> this<00:04:05.780> offseason

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
something to focus on for this offseason

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.490 
something to focus on for this offseason
something<00:04:08.630> I<00:04:08.690> definitely<00:04:08.959> have<00:04:09.140> to<00:04:09.200> bring<00:04:09.350> up

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
something I definitely have to bring up

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.370 
something I definitely have to bring up
and<00:04:10.239> that's<00:04:11.239> another<00:04:11.450> thing<00:04:11.540> that's<00:04:11.900> the

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
and that's another thing that's the

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.750 
and that's another thing that's the
reason<00:04:12.650> that<00:04:12.680> I<00:04:12.769> have<00:04:12.950> this<00:04:13.070> new<00:04:13.250> split<00:04:13.579> is

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
reason that I have this new split is

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.819 
reason that I have this new split is
because<00:04:14.120> I<00:04:14.390> wanted<00:04:15.109> to<00:04:15.200> devote<00:04:15.650> more

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:15.829 
because I wanted to devote more

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:18.279 
because I wanted to devote more
frequency<00:04:16.489> and<00:04:16.729> more<00:04:16.850> volume<00:04:17.239> to<00:04:17.269> my<00:04:18.109> with

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:18.289 
frequency and more volume to my with

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:20.500 
frequency and more volume to my with
your<00:04:18.440> muscle<00:04:18.709> groups<00:04:18.859> so<00:04:19.130> especially<00:04:19.880> my<00:04:20.239> legs

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
your muscle groups so especially my legs

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.120 
your muscle groups so especially my legs
I<00:04:20.690> want<00:04:20.870> to<00:04:20.959> I<00:04:21.169> don't<00:04:21.409> know<00:04:21.500> if<00:04:21.590> I<00:04:21.650> like<00:04:21.890> the

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
want to ask you pretty big legs on stage

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
and then this next exercise hack squats

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.090 
and then this next exercise hack squats
you'll<00:04:35.900> notice<00:04:36.080> I'm<00:04:36.260> going<00:04:36.410> kind<00:04:36.560> of<00:04:36.590> slow<00:04:36.770> but

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
you'll notice I'm going kind of slow but

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.740 
you'll notice I'm going kind of slow but
that's<00:04:37.280> not<00:04:37.460> because<00:04:37.640> I<00:04:37.820> intended<00:04:38.330> to<00:04:38.390> it's

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
that's not because I intended to it's

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.470 
that's not because I intended to it's
just<00:04:38.810> because<00:04:39.200> this<00:04:39.440> machine<00:04:40.090> the<00:04:41.090> bearings

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
just because this machine the bearings

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.510 
just because this machine the bearings
or<00:04:41.600> whatever<00:04:41.870> the<00:04:42.080> sled<00:04:42.680> was<00:04:42.830> rolling<00:04:43.130> on<00:04:43.280> it

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
or whatever the sled was rolling on it

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.490 
or whatever the sled was rolling on it
was<00:04:43.700> really<00:04:44.030> messed<00:04:44.240> up<00:04:44.450> and<00:04:44.690> it<00:04:45.110> provided

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
was really messed up and it provided

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.280 
was really messed up and it provided
quite<00:04:45.800> a<00:04:45.830> bit<00:04:45.980> of<00:04:46.040> resistance<00:04:46.310> on<00:04:46.580> the<00:04:46.670> way<00:04:46.820> up

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
quite a bit of resistance on the way up

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.020 
quite a bit of resistance on the way up
so<00:04:48.290> you<00:04:48.800> know<00:04:48.920> but<00:04:49.220> that's<00:04:49.520> all<00:04:49.640> I<00:04:49.670> had<00:04:49.880> there

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
so you know but that's all I had there

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.600 
so you know but that's all I had there
so<00:04:50.270> I<00:04:50.510> used<00:04:50.780> it<00:04:50.930> and<00:04:51.590> I<00:04:51.890> was<00:04:51.980> able<00:04:52.100> to<00:04:52.220> grind<00:04:52.400> out

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
so I used it and I was able to grind out

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.690 
so I used it and I was able to grind out
i<00:04:52.670> think<00:04:53.240> four<00:04:54.020> sets<00:04:54.290> of<00:04:54.500> i<00:04:54.800> think<00:04:55.400> i<00:04:55.430> did<00:04:55.580> buy

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:55.700 
i think four sets of i think i did buy

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.140 
i think four sets of i think i did buy
two<00:04:55.760> sets<00:04:56.120> of<00:04:56.180> six<00:04:56.390> and<00:04:56.660> two<00:04:57.410> sets<00:04:57.560> of<00:04:57.650> five<00:04:58.150> so

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
two sets of six and two sets of five so

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.230 
two sets of six and two sets of five so
next<00:04:59.480> week<00:04:59.660> i'll<00:04:59.780> keep<00:04:59.900> the<00:05:00.050> weight<00:05:00.170> the<00:05:00.290> same

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
next week i'll keep the weight the same

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.660 
next week i'll keep the weight the same
but<00:05:02.240> then<00:05:02.360> after<00:05:03.290> this<00:05:03.380> the<00:05:03.860> hack<00:05:04.070> squats<00:05:04.400> my

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:04.670 
but then after this the hack squats my

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:05.950 
but then after this the hack squats my
last<00:05:04.880> exercise<00:05:05.240> of<00:05:05.360> the<00:05:05.420> day<00:05:05.540> was<00:05:05.720> like

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
last exercise of the day was like

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.600 
last exercise of the day was like
extensions<00:05:06.440> but<00:05:06.650> i<00:05:06.710> didn't<00:05:07.220> film<00:05:07.400> that

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
extensions but i didn't film that

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.870 
extensions but i didn't film that
because<00:05:07.970> i<00:05:08.270> didn't<00:05:08.990> really<00:05:09.080> like<00:05:09.320> the<00:05:09.880> LA

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
because i didn't really like the LA

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.810 
because i didn't really like the LA
resented<00:05:11.240> machine<00:05:11.480> me<00:05:11.570> out<00:05:11.690> of<00:05:11.780> this<00:05:11.870> gym<00:05:12.820> and

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
resented machine me out of this gym and

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.790 
resented machine me out of this gym and
i'm<00:05:14.480> pretty<00:05:14.600> sure<00:05:14.810> most<00:05:14.930> you<00:05:15.110> guys<00:05:15.260> know<00:05:15.500> how

i'm pretty sure most you guys know how

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.170 
i'm pretty sure most you guys know how
to<00:05:15.830> do<00:05:16.010> let<00:05:16.160> eccentric<00:05:16.520> and<00:05:16.640> I<00:05:16.670> just<00:05:16.820> control

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
to do let eccentric and I just control

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.740 
to do let eccentric and I just control
the<00:05:17.210> movement<00:05:17.830> full<00:05:18.830> range<00:05:18.920> of<00:05:19.070> motion<00:05:19.130> and

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
the movement full range of motion and

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.590 
the movement full range of motion and
progressive<00:05:20.750> overload<00:05:21.910> but<00:05:22.910> yeah<00:05:23.300> I<00:05:23.330> hope<00:05:23.450> it

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 
progressive overload but yeah I hope it

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.470 
progressive overload but yeah I hope it
