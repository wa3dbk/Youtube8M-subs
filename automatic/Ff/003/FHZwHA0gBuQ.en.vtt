00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.990 
that and the reason is because of this
this<00:03:22.120> is<00:03:22.360> the<00:03:22.510> main<00:03:22.720> screen<00:03:23.080> in<00:03:23.470> a<00:03:24.000> smart

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
this is the main screen in a smart

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.640 
this is the main screen in a smart
launcher<00:03:25.180> so<00:03:25.660> it's<00:03:25.810> a<00:03:25.870> quite<00:03:26.260> a<00:03:26.290> different

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
launcher so it's a quite a different

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.320 
launcher so it's a quite a different
idea<00:03:26.920> to<00:03:27.130> your<00:03:27.250> normal<00:03:27.550> home<00:03:27.700> screen<00:03:28.030> so

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
idea to your normal home screen so

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.540 
idea to your normal home screen so
basically<00:03:29.020> all<00:03:29.140> your<00:03:29.530> main<00:03:29.920> applications

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
basically all your main applications

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.330 
basically all your main applications
that<00:03:30.730> you<00:03:30.850> would<00:03:31.000> use<00:03:31.270> most<00:03:31.900> often<00:03:32.140> are<00:03:32.470> always

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
that you would use most often are always

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.449 
that you would use most often are always
there<00:03:33.580> in<00:03:33.610> easy<00:03:34.090> access<00:03:34.540> for<00:03:34.840> you<00:03:35.020> so<00:03:35.620> as<00:03:35.950> usual

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
there in easy access for you so as usual

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.550 
there in easy access for you so as usual
if<00:03:36.850> you<00:03:37.000> want<00:03:37.209> you<00:03:37.600> can<00:03:37.690> go<00:03:37.840> along<00:03:37.930> and<00:03:38.170> select

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
browser it opens up my browser so just

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.510 
browser it opens up my browser so just
like<00:03:49.750> that<00:03:49.930> and<00:03:50.110> on<00:03:50.830> the<00:03:50.860> bottom<00:03:51.160> left<00:03:51.340> you'll

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
like that and on the bottom left you'll

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.500 
like that and on the bottom left you'll
be<00:03:51.610> able<00:03:51.700> to<00:03:51.850> see<00:03:51.970> that<00:03:52.120> there's<00:03:52.270> a<00:03:52.300> little

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
be able to see that there's a little

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.199 
be able to see that there's a little
area<00:03:52.690> to<00:03:53.050> actually<00:03:53.739> go<00:03:54.520> into<00:03:54.670> your<00:03:54.730> main<00:03:55.000> app

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
area to actually go into your main app

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:56.729 
area to actually go into your main app
drawer<00:03:55.420> so<00:03:56.020> this<00:03:56.170> is<00:03:56.290> all<00:03:56.500> of<00:03:56.620> your

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
drawer so this is all of your

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.979 
drawer so this is all of your
applications<00:03:57.370> split<00:03:57.790> into<00:03:57.970> different<00:03:58.780> kind

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
applications split into different kind

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.160 
applications split into different kind
of<00:03:59.170> categories<00:03:59.860> so<00:04:00.459> in<00:04:01.000> a<00:04:01.120> way<00:04:01.270> it's<00:04:01.600> kind<00:04:01.810> of

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
of categories so in a way it's kind of

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.040 
of categories so in a way it's kind of
like<00:04:02.880> relaunch<00:04:03.880> I<00:04:04.090> don't<00:04:04.270> know<00:04:04.390> if<00:04:04.660> you've

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
like relaunch I don't know if you've

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.780 
like relaunch I don't know if you've
seen<00:04:05.260> my<00:04:05.380> video<00:04:05.620> but<00:04:05.830> it's<00:04:06.310> the<00:04:06.370> same<00:04:06.489> kind<00:04:06.730> of

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
seen my video but it's the same kind of

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.280 
seen my video but it's the same kind of
deal<00:04:06.970> so<00:04:07.150> all<00:04:07.270> your<00:04:07.420> applications<00:04:07.510> are<00:04:08.050> split

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
deal so all your applications are split

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.780 
deal so all your applications are split
up<00:04:08.380> automatically<00:04:08.980> into<00:04:09.430> different

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
up automatically into different

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.699 
up automatically into different
categories<00:04:10.140> well<00:04:11.140> let's<00:04:11.290> take<00:04:11.440> a<00:04:11.500> look<00:04:11.620> at

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
categories well let's take a look at

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.620 
categories well let's take a look at
some<00:04:11.800> of<00:04:11.890> the<00:04:11.950> preferences<00:04:12.330> so<00:04:13.330> as<00:04:13.390> you<00:04:13.510> can

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
some of the preferences so as you can

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.690 
some of the preferences so as you can
see<00:04:13.780> here<00:04:14.050> there's<00:04:14.350> a<00:04:14.410> some<00:04:15.040> widget<00:04:15.340> support

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
see here there's a some widget support

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.390 
see here there's a some widget support
and<00:04:15.930> that<00:04:16.930> is<00:04:17.109> only<00:04:17.470> available<00:04:17.950> in<00:04:18.100> the<00:04:18.190> full

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
and that is only available in the full

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.449 
and that is only available in the full
version<00:04:18.669> so<00:04:19.390> as<00:04:19.600> it<00:04:20.140> turns<00:04:20.350> out<00:04:20.590> you<00:04:20.980> do<00:04:21.160> get

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
version so as it turns out you do get

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.310 
version so as it turns out you do get
some<00:04:21.669> extra<00:04:21.760> pages<00:04:22.300> with<00:04:22.419> some<00:04:22.600> widgets<00:04:23.050> of

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
some extra pages with some widgets of

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.200 
some extra pages with some widgets of
your<00:04:23.470> choice<00:04:23.740> but<00:04:24.070> you<00:04:24.340> do<00:04:24.669> have<00:04:24.850> to<00:04:24.970> pay<00:04:25.150> for

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
your choice but you do have to pay for

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.200 
your choice but you do have to pay for
that

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
that

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.879 
that
this<00:04:26.479> application<00:04:27.080> so<00:04:27.289> that's<00:04:27.440> pretty

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:27.889 
this application so that's pretty

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:30.400 
this application so that's pretty
unfortunate<00:04:28.190> but<00:04:29.000> it<00:04:29.090> still<00:04:29.690> works<00:04:30.050> quite

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
unfortunate but it still works quite

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.460 
unfortunate but it still works quite
well<00:04:30.440> with<00:04:30.919> just<00:04:31.160> the<00:04:31.580> regular<00:04:32.110> free<00:04:33.110> version

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
well with just the regular free version

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.040 
well with just the regular free version
so<00:04:34.220> let's<00:04:34.430> take<00:04:34.789> a<00:04:34.819> look<00:04:35.000> deeper<00:04:35.690> into<00:04:35.810> some<00:04:35.990> of

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
so let's take a look deeper into some of

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.740 
so let's take a look deeper into some of
these<00:04:36.229> settings<00:04:36.979> and<00:04:37.220> of<00:04:38.060> course<00:04:38.300> we<00:04:38.539> have<00:04:38.720> our

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
these settings and of course we have our

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.990 
these settings and of course we have our
transition<00:04:39.470> effect<00:04:39.770> and<00:04:39.949> this<00:04:40.430> kind<00:04:40.699> of<00:04:40.789> just

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
transition effect and this kind of just

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.270 
transition effect and this kind of just
changes<00:04:41.509> the<00:04:41.870> refresh<00:04:42.530> animation<00:04:43.099> about

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
changes the refresh animation about

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.490 
changes the refresh animation about
icons<00:04:43.880> so<00:04:44.599> you<00:04:44.660> can<00:04:44.900> choose<00:04:45.080> any<00:04:45.259> one<00:04:45.319> you<00:04:45.470> like

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
there there's a bunch of interesting

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.370 
there there's a bunch of interesting
ones<00:04:46.880> so<00:04:47.180> just<00:04:47.630> have<00:04:47.720> a<00:04:47.750> play<00:04:47.990> around<00:04:48.199> with

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
right-hand side you can actually install

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:01.810

have so yeah there you have it that is
smart<00:05:34.189> launcher<00:05:34.639> so<00:05:34.879> it's<00:05:35.300> one<00:05:35.419> of<00:05:35.509> those

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:35.599 
smart launcher so it's one of those

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:37.329 
smart launcher so it's one of those
launchers<00:05:36.050> that<00:05:36.080> isn't<00:05:36.529> very<00:05:36.559> well<00:05:36.889> known<00:05:37.129> but

00:05:37.329 --> 00:05:37.339 
launchers that isn't very well known but

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:39.999 
launchers that isn't very well known but
it<00:05:37.460> does<00:05:37.639> deserve<00:05:38.029> some<00:05:38.180> recognition<00:05:38.919> but<00:05:39.919> in

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:40.009 
it does deserve some recognition but in

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:41.499 
it does deserve some recognition but in
my<00:05:40.129> opinion<00:05:40.219> it<00:05:40.639> could<00:05:40.819> have<00:05:40.939> a<00:05:40.969> few<00:05:41.330> more

00:05:41.499 --> 00:05:41.509 
my opinion it could have a few more

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:43.360 
my opinion it could have a few more
features<00:05:41.900> in<00:05:42.169> the<00:05:42.199> free<00:05:42.469> version<00:05:42.650> but<00:05:43.279> it's

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
features in the free version but it's

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:44.679 
features in the free version but it's
still<00:05:43.460> a<00:05:43.520> very<00:05:43.669> good<00:05:43.789> launcher<00:05:44.240> and<00:05:44.360> check<00:05:44.569> it

00:05:44.679 --> 00:05:44.689
