it's a kind of traditional pattern you
know<00:01:47.490> it's<00:01:48.030> better<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.840> wear<00:01:49.200> white<00:01:50.840> maybe<00:01:51.840> a

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
know it's better to wear white maybe a

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.859

little like a yellow is okay but black
just<00:01:56.000> black<00:01:57.000> is<00:01:57.180> not<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.630> best<00:01:57.840> choice

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649
