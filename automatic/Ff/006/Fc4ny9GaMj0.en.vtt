00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
wreck them and they just can't move or

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.969 
wreck them and they just can't move or
you<00:01:21.570> stun<00:01:21.780> them<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.200> then<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.560> just<00:01:22.590> slows

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
you stun them and then it just slows

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.350 
you stun them and then it just slows
down<00:01:23.009> their<00:01:23.430> aim<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:23.970> makes<00:01:24.119> them<00:01:24.240> more

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
down their aim and it makes them more

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.880 
down their aim and it makes them more
accurate<00:01:24.780> which<00:01:24.930> seems<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.380> happen<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.680> lot<00:01:25.830> in

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
accurate which seems to happen a lot in

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.420 
but I might give that map a shot because
it<00:02:27.600> looks<00:02:27.750> pretty<00:02:27.900> interesting<00:02:28.440> and<00:02:28.770> for

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
it looks pretty interesting and for

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.250 
it looks pretty interesting and for
multiplayer<00:02:29.790> I<00:02:29.940> know<00:02:30.030> they<00:02:30.210> remade<00:02:30.600> I<00:02:30.930> think

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
multiplayer I know they remade I think

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.710 
multiplayer I know they remade I think
courtyard<00:02:31.710> from<00:02:31.890> all<00:02:32.130> that<00:02:32.250> war<00:02:32.460> and<00:02:32.730> stadium

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
courtyard from all that war and stadium

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.870 
courtyard from all that war and stadium
for<00:02:33.900> black<00:02:34.080> ops<00:02:34.110> 1<00:02:34.410> so<00:02:35.250> I'm<00:02:35.370> not<00:02:35.460> too<00:02:35.610> sure<00:02:35.730> how

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
for black ops 1 so I'm not too sure how

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.480 
for black ops 1 so I'm not too sure how
those<00:02:36.060> maps<00:02:36.270> will<00:02:36.570> play<00:02:36.720> out<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:37.490> anyways

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
those maps will play out and anyways

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.980 
those maps will play out and anyways
back<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.910> gameplay<00:02:39.060> they<00:02:39.450> plant<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.780> bomb

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
back to the gameplay they plant the bomb

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.480 
back to the gameplay they plant the bomb
right<00:02:40.170> here<00:02:40.350> and<00:02:40.560> I<00:02:40.680> think<00:02:40.860> it's<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.070> 1v2

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
right here and I think it's a 1v2

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.060 
right here and I think it's a 1v2
situation<00:02:42.300> I<00:02:42.510> get<00:02:43.230> a<00:02:43.260> lucky<00:02:43.500> lucky<00:02:43.800> little

much<00:03:16.530> I'm<00:03:17.280> black<00:03:17.459> ops<00:03:17.670> 1<00:03:17.820> it<00:03:18.239> was<00:03:18.390> awesome<00:03:18.750> but

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
much I'm black ops 1 it was awesome but

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.270 
much I'm black ops 1 it was awesome but
in<00:03:19.050> black<00:03:19.170> ops<00:03:19.350> 2<00:03:19.500> it<00:03:19.739> just<00:03:19.920> doesn't<00:03:20.160> really

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
in black ops 2 it just doesn't really

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.970 
in black ops 2 it just doesn't really
work<00:03:20.459> out<00:03:20.640> I<00:03:20.910> think<00:03:21.870> I<00:03:22.080> don't<00:03:22.350> know<00:03:22.410> uplink<00:03:22.800> is

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
work out I think I don't know uplink is

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.009 
work out I think I don't know uplink is
ok<00:03:23.370> a<00:03:23.400> plank<00:03:23.790> is<00:03:23.910> but<00:03:24.239> it's<00:03:24.360> still<00:03:24.540> not<00:03:24.690> as<00:03:24.810> fun

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
ok a plank is but it's still not as fun

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.410 
ok a plank is but it's still not as fun
as<00:03:25.110> summit<00:03:25.440> studio<00:03:26.430> is<00:03:26.670> really<00:03:26.940> the<00:03:27.060> only<00:03:27.180> one

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
as summit studio is really the only one

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.640 
as summit studio is really the only one
that<00:03:27.630> really<00:03:27.750> works<00:03:28.080> for<00:03:28.260> me<00:03:28.350> it<00:03:28.470> actually

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
that really works for me it actually

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.920 
that really works for me it actually
feels<00:03:28.980> like<00:03:29.250> firing<00:03:29.489> range<00:03:29.790> but<00:03:30.420> other<00:03:30.780> than

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
feels like firing range but other than

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.390 
feels like firing range but other than
that<00:03:30.989> I<00:03:31.140> don't<00:03:31.260> think<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:31.709> remakes<00:03:32.070> ever

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
that I don't think the remakes ever

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.610 
that I don't think the remakes ever
really<00:03:32.790> worked<00:03:32.940> out<00:03:33.120> that<00:03:33.300> well<00:03:33.450> but<00:03:34.290> back<00:03:34.590> in

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
really worked out that well but back in

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.800 
really worked out that well but back in
modern<00:03:35.010> warfare<00:03:35.040> 2<00:03:35.519> when<00:03:35.820> they<00:03:36.420> brought<00:03:36.600> back
