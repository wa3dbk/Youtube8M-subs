on<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.470> pole<00:00:22.680> so<00:00:23.580> we<00:00:23.820> start<00:00:24.150> with<00:00:24.539> our<00:00:24.840> feeding

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
on the pole so we start with our feeding

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.700 
on the pole so we start with our feeding
bag<00:00:26.330> this<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.630> feeding<00:00:27.930> bag<00:00:28.140> that<00:00:28.529> goes

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
bag this is the feeding bag that goes

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.320 
bag this is the feeding bag that goes
with<00:00:28.920> this<00:00:29.039> pump<00:00:29.400> this<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.910> smaller<00:00:30.210> size

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
with this pump this is the smaller size

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.179 
with this pump this is the smaller size
there's<00:00:30.869> also<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.170> larger<00:00:31.590> size<00:00:31.830> we're<00:00:32.160> going

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
there's also a larger size we're going

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.549 
there's also a larger size we're going
to<00:00:32.340> start<00:00:32.550> with<00:00:32.669> small<00:00:32.940> one<00:00:33.180> today<00:00:33.559> we're

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
to start with small one today we're

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.200 
to start with small one today we're
going<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.739> open<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.010> cap<00:00:35.219> that's<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.940> first

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
going to open the cap that's the first

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.959 
going to open the cap that's the first
after<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:36.809> wash<00:00:37.020> your<00:00:37.170> hands<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.680> course

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
after you wash your hands of course

after you wash your hands of course
we're<00:00:38.969> going<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.149> open<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.450> cap<00:00:39.600> it's<00:00:39.809> kind<00:00:40.020> of

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
we're going to open the cap it's kind of

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.200 
we're going to open the cap it's kind of
like<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.290> gas<00:00:40.649> cap<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:41.670> have<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:42.000> push

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
like a gas cap and that you have to push

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.810 
like a gas cap and that you have to push
it<00:00:42.390> down<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.989> twist<00:00:43.230> it<00:00:43.440> or<00:00:43.649> twist<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.700> and

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
it down and twist it or twist it and

it down and twist it or twist it and
pull<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.059> up<00:00:45.270> so<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.110> has<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.260> good<00:00:46.500> seal

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
pull it up so that it has a good seal

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.400 
pull it up so that it has a good seal
let<00:00:47.250> any<00:00:47.399> air<00:00:47.579> in<00:00:47.870> so<00:00:48.870> when<00:00:49.020> you're<00:00:49.170> pouring

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
let any air in so when you're pouring

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.170 
let any air in so when you're pouring
your<00:00:49.530> formula<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.610> want<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:50.879> be<00:00:50.969> careful

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
your formula and you want to be careful

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.600 
your formula and you want to be careful
that<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:52.260> don't<00:00:52.379> spill<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.800> everywhere<00:00:52.860> so

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
that you don't spill it everywhere so

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.029 
that you don't spill it everywhere so
you<00:00:54.390> want<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.840> make<00:00:55.079> sure<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.350> pull<00:00:55.620> out<00:00:55.649> the

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
you want to make sure you pull out the

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.729 
you want to make sure you pull out the
back<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:57.180> bag<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.260> let<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.559> little

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
back of the bag so that you let a little

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.670 
back of the bag so that you let a little
air<00:00:59.039> in<00:00:59.070> there<00:01:00.260> and<00:01:01.260> we're<00:01:01.379> going<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.530> come

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
air in there and we're going to come

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.719 
air in there and we're going to come
over<00:01:01.710> here<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.520> want<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.760> shake<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.809> formula

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
over here you want to shake the formula

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.850 
over here you want to shake the formula
so<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.909> anything<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.540> separated<00:01:07.470> comes

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
so that anything that separated comes

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.640 
so that anything that separated comes
back<00:01:08.130> together<00:01:08.659> start<00:01:09.659> pouring<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.229> in<00:01:10.350> you're

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
back together start pouring it in you're

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.289 
back together start pouring it in you're
probably<00:01:10.890> going<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.189> want<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.400> make<00:01:11.549> sure<00:01:11.820> that

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
probably going to want to make sure that

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.609 
probably going to want to make sure that
the<00:01:12.659> end<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:13.140> capped<00:01:14.990> then<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.170> pour<00:01:16.439> your

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
the end is capped then you pour your

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.950 
the end is capped then you pour your
formula<00:01:17.159> in<00:01:17.960> we'll<00:01:18.960> just<00:01:19.140> fill<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.470> up<00:01:19.590> halfway

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
formula in we'll just fill it up halfway

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.200 
formula in we'll just fill it up halfway
then<00:01:21.960> number<00:01:22.770> one<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.280> want<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.580> get<00:01:23.700> any<00:01:23.909> air

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
then number one you want to get any air

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.359 
then number one you want to get any air
out<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.840> bags<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.500> don't<00:01:25.680> want<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.100> air

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
out of the bags you don't want the air

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.819 
out of the bags you don't want the air
going<00:01:26.939> into<00:01:27.210> your<00:01:27.330> stomach<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.259> can<00:01:28.530> start

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
going into your stomach so you can start

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.830 
going into your stomach so you can start
that<00:01:29.040> process<00:01:29.490> by<00:01:29.729> kind<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.060> squeezing<00:01:30.570> the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
that process by kind of squeezing the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.120 
that process by kind of squeezing the
bag<00:01:31.020> squeeze<00:01:31.890> as<00:01:32.130> much<00:01:32.280> air<00:01:32.549> as<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.759> can<00:01:34.130> then

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
bag squeeze as much air as you can then

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.280 
bag squeeze as much air as you can then
you<00:01:35.250> want<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.490> cap<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.750> we<00:01:36.900> have<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.170> make

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
you want to cap it and we have to make

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.800 
you want to cap it and we have to make
sure<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:37.860> twists<00:01:38.250> on<00:01:38.400> well<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:39.270> no<00:01:39.600> air

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
sure that it twists on well so no air

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.060 
sure that it twists on well so no air
can<00:01:40.049> get<00:01:40.140> in<00:01:40.290> there<00:01:42.470> here's<00:01:43.470> another<00:01:43.770> way<00:01:44.040> to

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
can get in there here's another way to

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.149 
can get in there here's another way to
prime<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.000> pump<00:01:45.320> manually<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.500> get<00:01:46.619> even<00:01:46.920> more

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
prime the pump manually to get even more

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.210 
prime the pump manually to get even more
air<00:01:47.460> out<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.630> faster<00:01:49.290> way<00:01:49.439> than<00:01:49.740> doing

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
air out this is a faster way than doing

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.580 
air out this is a faster way than doing
it<00:01:50.340> by<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:51.450> automatic<00:01:51.840> way<00:01:52.140> on<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.350> pump

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
it by the automatic way on the pump

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.130 
it by the automatic way on the pump
there's<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.399> little<00:01:53.700> teardrop<00:01:54.000> edged<00:01:54.570> on<00:01:54.930> to

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
there's a little teardrop edged on to

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.830 
there's a little teardrop edged on to
this<00:01:55.229> blue<00:01:55.530> tubing<00:01:55.979> push<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:56.939> teardrop<00:01:57.299> down

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
this blue tubing push that teardrop down

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.459 
this blue tubing push that teardrop down
and<00:01:58.290> as<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.430> squeeze<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.939> bag<00:02:00.290> what<00:02:01.290> that

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
and as you squeeze the bag what that

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.330 
and as you squeeze the bag what that
does<00:02:01.710> is<00:02:01.979> allow<00:02:02.840> air<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:04.290> go<00:02:04.469> through<00:02:04.860> here<00:02:05.219> it

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
does is allow air to go through here it

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.570 
does is allow air to go through here it
opens<00:02:05.549> up<00:02:06.049> this<00:02:07.049> tubing<00:02:07.619> so<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:07.979> can<00:02:08.250> squeeze

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
opens up this tubing so you can squeeze

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.260 
opens up this tubing so you can squeeze
the<00:02:08.759> bag<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.330> see<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.170> formula<00:02:10.590> pushing

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
the bag and see the formula pushing

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.080 
the bag and see the formula pushing
air<00:02:11.390> out<00:02:12.130> and<00:02:13.130> that's<00:02:13.340> how<00:02:13.460> you<00:02:13.610> manually

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
air out and that's how you manually

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.170 
air out and that's how you manually
prime<00:02:14.630> the<00:02:15.320> bag<00:02:15.500> you<00:02:16.430> can<00:02:16.550> also<00:02:16.730> choose<00:02:17.120> to

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
prime the bag you can also choose to

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.570 
prime the bag you can also choose to
have<00:02:17.480> the<00:02:17.780> pump<00:02:18.050> do<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.470> priming<00:02:19.010> or<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.430> air

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
have the pump do the priming or the air

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.830 
have the pump do the priming or the air
removal<00:02:20.150> for<00:02:20.420> you

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
removal for you

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.900 
removal for you
so<00:02:21.830> first<00:02:22.520> we're<00:02:23.240> going<00:02:23.420> to<00:02:23.720> load<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.470> set<00:02:24.910> all

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
so first we're going to load the set all

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.830 
so first we're going to load the set all
you<00:02:26.450> do<00:02:26.600> is<00:02:26.960> pull<00:02:27.890> this<00:02:28.130> tubing<00:02:28.630> over<00:02:29.630> this

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
you do is pull this tubing over this

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.720 
you do is pull this tubing over this
round<00:02:30.230> black<00:02:30.590> plastic<00:02:30.920> piece<00:02:31.340> here<00:02:31.370> that's

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
round black plastic piece here that's

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.360 
round black plastic piece here that's
the<00:02:31.850> rotor<00:02:32.090> you<00:02:32.510> might<00:02:33.500> stretch<00:02:33.950> it<00:02:34.130> a<00:02:34.190> little

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
the rotor you might stretch it a little

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.640 
the rotor you might stretch it a little
bit<00:02:34.550> but<00:02:35.120> then<00:02:35.300> it<00:02:35.330> fits<00:02:35.630> right<00:02:35.990> in<00:02:36.200> there<00:02:36.410> you

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
bit but then it fits right in there you

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.850 
bit but then it fits right in there you
close<00:02:37.490> the<00:02:37.730> door<00:02:37.940> and<00:02:38.270> then<00:02:38.330> we<00:02:39.230> turn<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:39.470> pump

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
close the door and then we turn the pump

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.330 
close the door and then we turn the pump
on<00:02:41.380> its<00:02:42.380> going<00:02:42.500> to<00:02:42.560> go<00:02:42.710> through<00:02:42.920> a<00:02:42.980> series<00:02:43.190> of

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
on its going to go through a series of

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.310 
on its going to go through a series of
numbers<00:02:43.820> while<00:02:44.060> it<00:02:44.150> kind<00:02:44.360> of<00:02:44.390> warms<00:02:44.720> up<00:02:44.930> you

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
numbers while it kind of warms up you

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.630 
numbers while it kind of warms up you
want<00:02:45.470> to<00:02:45.560> make<00:02:45.650> sure<00:02:45.680> you<00:02:45.950> always<00:02:46.100> keep<00:02:46.220> your

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
want to make sure you always keep your

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.880 
want to make sure you always keep your
pump<00:02:46.850> plugged<00:02:47.180> in<00:02:47.510> as<00:02:47.810> much<00:02:48.050> as<00:02:48.170> possible<00:02:48.380> that

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
pump plugged in as much as possible that

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.150 
pump plugged in as much as possible that
helps<00:02:49.130> extend<00:02:49.370> the<00:02:49.610> battery<00:02:49.790> life<00:02:50.950> so<00:02:51.950> now

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
helps extend the battery life so now

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.820 
helps extend the battery life so now
we've<00:02:52.370> got<00:02:52.550> the<00:02:52.760> pump<00:02:53.000> turned<00:02:53.270> on<00:02:53.620> we're<00:02:54.620> going

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
we've got the pump turned on we're going

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.160 
we've got the pump turned on we're going
to<00:02:54.890> set<00:02:55.100> a<00:02:55.130> rate<00:02:55.430> that<00:02:55.850> we<00:02:56.030> want<00:02:56.270> the<00:02:56.510> feeding

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
to set a rate that we want the feeding

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.260 
to set a rate that we want the feeding
to<00:02:57.320> run<00:02:57.500> but<00:02:57.860> first<00:02:58.160> we're<00:02:58.550> going<00:02:58.700> to<00:02:58.850> prime

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
to run but first we're going to prime

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.630 
to run but first we're going to prime
finish<00:02:59.660> priming<00:03:00.260> it<00:03:00.350> to<00:03:00.650> release<00:03:00.950> any<00:03:01.220> air<00:03:01.280> out

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
finish priming it to release any air out

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.800 
finish priming it to release any air out
of<00:03:01.670> the<00:03:01.820> bag<00:03:02.000> so<00:03:03.880> you<00:03:04.880> can<00:03:05.120> either<00:03:05.210> put<00:03:05.510> the<00:03:05.660> end

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
of the bag so you can either put the end

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.200 
of the bag so you can either put the end
of<00:03:06.020> this<00:03:06.200> into<00:03:06.620> a<00:03:06.650> cup<00:03:06.950> or<00:03:07.250> you<00:03:07.760> can<00:03:07.910> just<00:03:08.060> put

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.210 
of this into a cup or you can just put

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:09.880 
of this into a cup or you can just put
your<00:03:08.300> finger<00:03:08.570> on<00:03:08.600> the<00:03:08.780> end<00:03:08.930> or<00:03:09.230> just<00:03:09.410> watch<00:03:09.620> it

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
your finger on the end or just watch it

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.530 
your finger on the end or just watch it
and<00:03:10.010> make<00:03:10.250> sure<00:03:10.460> that<00:03:10.730> the<00:03:10.850> formula<00:03:11.090> doesn't

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
and make sure that the formula doesn't

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.020 
and make sure that the formula doesn't
go<00:03:11.630> out<00:03:12.010> because<00:03:13.010> as<00:03:13.220> long<00:03:13.370> as<00:03:13.430> you're<00:03:13.640> holding

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
go out because as long as you're holding

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.680 
go out because as long as you're holding
down<00:03:14.180> this<00:03:14.420> prime<00:03:14.840> button<00:03:16.210> the<00:03:17.210> formula<00:03:17.630> is

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
down this prime button the formula is

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.190 
down this prime button the formula is
going<00:03:17.870> to<00:03:17.930> go<00:03:18.050> through<00:03:19.660> so<00:03:20.660> you<00:03:20.750> can<00:03:20.900> see<00:03:21.110> it

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
going to go through so you can see it

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.600 
going to go through so you can see it
going<00:03:21.410> through<00:03:21.620> you<00:03:21.770> can<00:03:21.860> hear<00:03:22.250> the<00:03:22.400> rotor

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
going through you can hear the rotor

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.600 
going through you can hear the rotor
turning<00:03:23.180> you<00:03:23.540> know<00:03:23.570> it's<00:03:23.840> working<00:03:24.520> now<00:03:25.520> we're

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
turning you know it's working now we're

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:26.680 
turning you know it's working now we're
going<00:03:25.700> to<00:03:25.760> see<00:03:25.970> it<00:03:26.060> come<00:03:26.210> out<00:03:26.270> the<00:03:26.330> other<00:03:26.570> end

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
going to see it come out the other end

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.110 
going to see it come out the other end
here<00:03:27.050> if<00:03:27.860> you<00:03:28.040> want<00:03:28.250> to<00:03:28.280> stop<00:03:28.520> priming<00:03:29.000> you

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
here if you want to stop priming you

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.180 
here if you want to stop priming you
just<00:03:29.300> let<00:03:29.450> go<00:03:29.570> of<00:03:29.600> that<00:03:29.840> button<00:03:30.050> otherwise<00:03:30.650> you

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
just let go of that button otherwise you

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.700 
just let go of that button otherwise you
need<00:03:31.310> to<00:03:31.430> hold<00:03:31.610> it<00:03:31.700> down<00:03:32.380> until<00:03:33.380> you<00:03:33.530> get<00:03:33.650> to

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:33.710 
need to hold it down until you get to

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.140 
need to hold it down until you get to
the<00:03:33.950> ends<00:03:34.220> your<00:03:34.370> base<00:03:34.520> we're<00:03:34.760> going<00:03:34.880> to<00:03:34.940> push

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
the ends your base we're going to push

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.050 
the ends your base we're going to push
all<00:03:35.390> of<00:03:35.420> the<00:03:35.660> air<00:03:35.690> out<00:03:35.840> to<00:03:36.620> the<00:03:36.740> end<00:03:36.950> of<00:03:37.400> this

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
all of the air out to the end of this

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.820 
all of the air out to the end of this
tubing<00:03:38.510> and<00:03:38.750> you'll<00:03:38.930> see<00:03:39.140> the<00:03:39.260> formula<00:03:39.470> go

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
tubing and you'll see the formula go

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.890 
tubing and you'll see the formula go
down<00:03:40.070> and<00:03:40.400> the<00:03:40.700> purpose<00:03:41.000> of<00:03:41.150> that<00:03:41.300> again<00:03:41.570> is<00:03:41.600> to

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
down and the purpose of that again is to

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.090 
down and the purpose of that again is to
make<00:03:42.020> sure<00:03:42.200> that<00:03:42.470> you're<00:03:42.650> not<00:03:42.740> getting<00:03:42.920> any

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
make sure that you're not getting any

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.700 
make sure that you're not getting any
air<00:03:43.520> into<00:03:44.450> your<00:03:44.570> stomach<00:03:44.780> is<00:03:45.110> that<00:03:45.350> can<00:03:45.530> cause

gas and bloating and course be

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.550 
gas and bloating and course be
uncomfortable<00:03:48.110> so<00:03:49.300> once<00:03:50.300> we're<00:03:50.510> done<00:03:50.660> priming

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
uncomfortable so once we're done priming

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.400 
uncomfortable so once we're done priming
then<00:03:51.980> we<00:03:52.130> can<00:03:52.310> set<00:03:52.580> a<00:03:52.820> rate<00:03:53.270> for<00:03:53.570> how<00:03:53.660> fast<00:03:53.990> we

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
then we can set a rate for how fast we

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.040 
then we can set a rate for how fast we
want<00:03:54.560> the<00:03:54.830> pump<00:03:55.040> to<00:03:55.220> go<00:03:55.780> so<00:03:56.780> we'll<00:03:56.870> go<00:03:56.990> ahead

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 
want the pump to go so we'll go ahead

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.820 
want the pump to go so we'll go ahead
and<00:03:57.170> do<00:03:57.380> that

get rid of that decimal point people can

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.560 
get rid of that decimal point people can

make a mistake and accidentally put a

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:50.380 
make a mistake and accidentally put a

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 
dose of 0.7 or 7.0 instead of 70 so we

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.430 
dose of 0.7 or 7.0 instead of 70 so we
want<00:04:50.570> to<00:04:50.630> make<00:04:50.750> sure<00:04:50.780> we<00:04:50.990> get<00:04:51.080> rid<00:04:51.260> of<00:04:51.290> that

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
want to make sure we get rid of that

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.860 
want to make sure we get rid of that
decimal<00:04:51.680> point<00:04:52.180> so<00:04:53.180> we're<00:04:53.330> just<00:04:53.360> hitting<00:04:53.600> that

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
decimal point so we're just hitting that

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.530 
decimal point so we're just hitting that
plus<00:04:54.140> button<00:04:54.820> until<00:04:55.820> we<00:04:55.940> get<00:04:56.060> to<00:04:56.240> the<00:04:56.360> dose

that<00:04:56.810> we<00:04:56.960> want<00:04:57.170> we've<00:04:57.950> filled<00:04:58.190> the<00:04:58.310> bag<00:04:58.460> up

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:58.670 
that we want we've filled the bag up

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.250 
that we want we've filled the bag up
about<00:04:58.850> half<00:04:59.060> way<00:04:59.300> so<00:04:59.330> let's<00:04:59.690> say<00:04:59.870> we<00:04:59.990> want<00:05:00.170> the

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
about half way so let's say we want the

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.150 
about half way so let's say we want the
dose<00:05:00.410> to<00:05:00.440> be<00:05:00.770> 250<00:05:02.440> we<00:05:03.440> can<00:05:03.620> set<00:05:03.830> the<00:05:03.950> dose<00:05:04.130> to

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
dose to be 250 we can set the dose to

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.830 
dose to be 250 we can set the dose to
250<00:05:05.830> and<00:05:06.830> that's<00:05:07.130> how<00:05:07.670> much<00:05:07.910> formula<00:05:08.270> is<00:05:08.630> going

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
250 and that's how much formula is going

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.210 
250 and that's how much formula is going
to<00:05:08.900> run<00:05:09.080> through<00:05:09.410> and<00:05:09.590> the<00:05:09.650> pump<00:05:09.860> is<00:05:09.980> going<00:05:10.130> to

to run through and the pump is going to

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.000 
to run through and the pump is going to
stop<00:05:10.460> when<00:05:10.940> it's<00:05:10.970> done<00:05:11.240> infusing<00:05:12.010> 250

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.010

stop when it's done infusing 250
milliliters<00:05:14.320> if<00:05:15.320> we<00:05:15.800> just<00:05:15.980> want<00:05:16.160> the<00:05:16.250> pump<00:05:16.490> to

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
milliliters if we just want the pump to

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.030 
milliliters if we just want the pump to
keep<00:05:16.760> running<00:05:17.240> until<00:05:17.660> it's<00:05:17.930> empty<00:05:18.169> then

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:19.040 
keep running until it's empty then

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.860 
keep running until it's empty then
that's<00:05:19.220> called<00:05:19.520> the<00:05:19.700> Infinity<00:05:20.180> setting<00:05:20.540> so<00:05:20.780> we

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
that's called the Infinity setting so we

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.800 
that's called the Infinity setting so we
can<00:05:21.020> just<00:05:21.169> hit<00:05:21.380> this<00:05:21.710> plus<00:05:21.980> button<00:05:22.660> push<00:05:23.660> it

until<00:05:42.980> as<00:05:43.100> long<00:05:43.280> as<00:05:43.490> we<00:05:43.640> have<00:05:43.760> formula<00:05:44.210> in<00:05:44.360> the

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.450 
until as long as we have formula in the

until as long as we have formula in the
bag<00:05:45.070> now<00:05:46.070> we<00:05:46.130> can<00:05:46.400> hit<00:05:46.580> our<00:05:47.180> Run<00:05:47.750> button<00:05:48.700> and

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:49.700 
bag now we can hit our Run button and

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.880 
bag now we can hit our Run button and
the<00:05:49.790> formula<00:05:50.150> will<00:05:50.180> start<00:05:50.510> infusing<00:05:50.930> there

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:51.890 
the formula will start infusing there

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.730 
the formula will start infusing there
you<00:05:51.950> see<00:05:52.160> it<00:05:52.250> going<00:05:52.430> through<00:05:53.350> and<00:05:54.350> that's<00:05:54.590> how

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
you see it going through and that's how

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.770 
you see it going through and that's how
you<00:05:54.800> start<00:05:55.100> your<00:05:55.190> feeding<00:05:55.790> with<00:05:56.180> the<00:05:56.300> infinity

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 
you start your feeding with the infinity

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.900 
you start your feeding with the infinity
pump<00:05:57.200> thank<00:05:58.010> you<00:05:58.070> very<00:05:58.220> much

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:00.910
