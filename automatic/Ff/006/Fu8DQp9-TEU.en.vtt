unusual cases of heart worms and dogs
dogs<00:00:37.200> getting<00:00:37.530> heart<00:00:37.980> worms<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.670> not<00:00:39.090> uncommon

dogs getting heart worms is not uncommon

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.200 
dogs getting heart worms is not uncommon
but<00:00:40.079> in<00:00:40.290> all<00:00:40.530> of<00:00:40.710> these<00:00:40.920> cases<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.670> dogs<00:00:42.000> were

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
but in all of these cases the dogs were

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.450 
but in all of these cases the dogs were
on<00:00:42.360> regular<00:00:42.960> heartworm<00:00:43.530> prevention<00:00:44.070> how

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
on regular heartworm prevention how

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.950 
on regular heartworm prevention how
could<00:00:44.640> this<00:00:44.760> happen<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.629> simplest

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
could this happen the simplest

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.869 
could this happen the simplest
explanation<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:46.920> that<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.309> owners<00:00:47.670> weren't

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
explanation is that the owners weren't

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.790 
explanation is that the owners weren't
giving<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.329> medication<00:00:49.170> or<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.559> dogs

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
giving the medication or the dogs

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.010 
giving the medication or the dogs
weren't<00:00:50.070> eating<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.700> detailed<00:00:51.420> reviews<00:00:51.809> the

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
weren't eating it detailed reviews the

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.260 
weren't eating it detailed reviews the
medical<00:00:52.379> records<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.829> odor<00:00:53.640> interviews

medical records and odor interviews

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.779 
medical records and odor interviews
proved<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:55.410> at<00:00:55.559> least<00:00:55.770> some<00:00:56.219> of<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.430> owners

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
proved that at least some of the owners

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.260 
proved that at least some of the owners
were<00:00:56.820> compliant<00:00:57.750> another<00:00:58.739> idea<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.460> more

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
were compliant another idea is that more

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.529 
were compliant another idea is that more
sensitive<00:01:01.079> heartworm<00:01:01.559> tests<00:01:02.039> can<00:01:02.489> detect

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
sensitive heartworm tests can detect

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.620 
sensitive heartworm tests can detect
cases<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:04.049> were<00:01:04.170> previously<00:01:04.589> missed<00:01:05.129> and

cases that were previously missed and

cases that were previously missed and
finally<00:01:06.630> some<00:01:06.930> experts<00:01:07.439> believe<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.860> severe

finally some experts believe that severe
