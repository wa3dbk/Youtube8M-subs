riffle<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.909> cards<00:01:18.680> what<00:01:19.680> this<00:01:19.920> does<00:01:20.780> is<00:01:21.780> to

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
riffle the cards what this does is to

00:01:22.350 --> 00:02:01.400 
riffle the cards what this does is to

the half a jiggle pass of my own
invention<00:02:05.620> is<00:02:06.010> the<00:02:06.460> way<00:02:06.580> I<00:02:06.610> currently<00:02:07.000> use<00:02:07.210> the

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
invention is the way I currently use the

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.240 
invention is the way I currently use the
pass<00:02:07.780> most<00:02:08.140> often<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.940> pass<00:02:10.180> is<00:02:10.390> silent<00:02:11.040> as<00:02:12.040> is

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
pass most often the pass is silent as is

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.800 
pass most often the pass is silent as is
not<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.430> case<00:02:12.760> with<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.060> riffle<00:02:13.390> and<00:02:13.450> so<00:02:13.630> does

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
not the case with the riffle and so does

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.900 
not the case with the riffle and so does
not<00:02:13.960> a<00:02:13.990> draw<00:02:14.320> undue<00:02:14.770> attention<00:02:14.800> to<00:02:15.520> the<00:02:15.700> deck

type of action what it attempts to do is

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.100 
type of action what it attempts to do is
simulate<00:03:23.950> the<00:03:24.459> action<00:03:24.910> of<00:03:25.090> having<00:03:25.840> a<00:03:25.870> card
