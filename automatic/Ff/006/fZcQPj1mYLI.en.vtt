00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.280
 and very good to all and welcome from 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.920
 again another tutorial where I come to 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:18.070
 explain this curious cable to charge 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:21.250
 our smartphones xperia z 1 z 2 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.830
 teatres yz 3 compact with this that 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.509
 we will avoid the wear of the gums that 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.980
 They wear the covers that prevent them from entering 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:28.980
 water in agreement 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.899
 the covers these laterals that have 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.329
 well then and then we will connect to this 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:40.350
 slot that we can see here is worth a 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.350
 magnetic charger 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.970
 and now I'm going to teach you 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.180
 well we took it out of the bag 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.710
 and we have it 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.930
 as you can see 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.720
 they have a magnet in kind of magnet 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.610
 technical and two connections is made of 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.860
 metal 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.120
 and here it will light up depends on the 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.120
 charge that our smartphone has 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:19.670
 I am connect to our next charger 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.670
 with our sonisphere already by the usb 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.990
 Are you connected 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.380
 and this part connects to the slot that 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.380
 we have on the left side 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.870
 and it stays fixed with the magnet as it 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.650
 can observe does not fall 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.650
 and moves 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.620
 the indicator lights up in color 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.380
 red will mean that you have little battery 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.750
 and when it's fully charged 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.039
 our smartphone the indicator will 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.039
 they will be blue 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.550
 in description I'll leave everything to us 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:23.650
