lot<00:01:57.060> of<00:01:57.090> people<00:01:57.420> do<00:01:57.600> now<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.860> cover<00:01:59.100> on<00:01:59.340> this

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
lot of people do now the cover on this

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.550 
lot of people do now the cover on this
is<00:01:59.729> actually<00:01:59.939> magnetic<00:02:00.689> closure<00:02:00.930> okay<00:02:01.439> and

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
is actually magnetic closure okay and

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.760 
is actually magnetic closure okay and
you<00:02:01.680> just<00:02:01.860> lies<00:02:02.369> its<00:02:02.670> cover<00:02:02.939> out<00:02:03.600> alright<00:02:04.469> and

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
you just lies its cover out alright and

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.550 
you just lies its cover out alright and
then<00:02:04.979> it's<00:02:05.189> going<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.759> expose<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:07.020> palette<00:02:07.439> of

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
then it's going to expose the palette of

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.559 
then it's going to expose the palette of
course<00:02:07.950> alright<00:02:08.759> so<00:02:08.970> that's<00:02:09.179> kind<00:02:09.450> of<00:02:09.509> good

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
course alright so that's kind of good

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.309 
course alright so that's kind of good
because<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:09.959> can<00:02:10.110> actually<00:02:10.319> see<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:11.009> colors

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
because you can actually see the colors

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.470 
because you can actually see the colors
with<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:12.800> lid<00:02:13.010> on<00:02:13.160> all<00:02:13.580> right<00:02:14.000> so<00:02:14.210> you<00:02:14.270> can

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
with the lid on all right so you can

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.030 
with the lid on all right so you can
tell<00:02:14.630> if<00:02:14.750> this<00:02:14.900> is<00:02:14.960> the<00:02:15.170> bright<00:02:15.380> palette<00:02:15.890> and

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
products right into the brush you're not

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.630 
products right into the brush you're not
going<00:04:02.959> to<00:04:03.079> get<00:04:03.230> as<00:04:03.350> much<00:04:03.590> of<00:04:03.799> those<00:04:03.980> okay

so<00:04:04.850> there's<00:04:05.030> a<00:04:05.090> fine<00:04:05.329> line<00:04:05.360> between<00:04:05.690> brushing

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
so there's a fine line between brushing

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.590 
so there's a fine line between brushing
to<00:04:06.739> pick<00:04:06.950> up<00:04:07.190> the<00:04:07.549> color<00:04:07.790> which<00:04:08.120> is<00:04:08.269> going<00:04:08.480> to

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
to pick up the color which is going to

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.569 
to pick up the color which is going to
generate<00:04:08.720> a<00:04:09.200> lot<00:04:09.440> of<00:04:09.620> those<00:04:09.739> loose<00:04:10.070> powders

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
generate a lot of those loose powders

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:13.330 
generate a lot of those loose powders
and<00:04:10.760> also<00:04:11.540> dabbing<00:04:12.200> and<00:04:12.410> picking<00:04:13.100> up<00:04:13.190> the

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
and also dabbing and picking up the

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.520 
and also dabbing and picking up the
color<00:04:13.579> and<00:04:13.940> working<00:04:14.540> it<00:04:14.630> in<00:04:14.780> your<00:04:14.900> bristle<00:04:15.350> as

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.909 
color and working it in your bristle as
opposed<00:04:16.010> to<00:04:16.100> sweeping<00:04:16.729> the<00:04:17.359> product<00:04:17.810> okay<00:04:18.229> so

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 
opposed to sweeping the product okay so

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:20.920 
opposed to sweeping the product okay so
that's<00:04:19.640> just<00:04:19.820> the<00:04:20.180> only<00:04:20.299> thing<00:04:20.450> it's<00:04:20.690> just<00:04:20.750> a

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
that's just the only thing it's just a

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.659 
that's just the only thing it's just a
matter<00:04:21.080> of<00:04:21.200> how<00:04:21.560> you<00:04:21.620> pick<00:04:21.919> up<00:04:22.039> the<00:04:22.250> product

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
matter of how you pick up the product

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:23.690 
matter of how you pick up the product
from<00:04:22.820> the

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700

spatula or whatever and I end up putting
dings<00:05:02.640> and<00:05:03.090> scratches<00:05:03.390> and<00:05:04.170> stuff<00:05:04.530> like<00:05:04.710> that

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:04.920 
dings and scratches and stuff like that

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.450 
dings and scratches and stuff like that
on<00:05:05.220> the<00:05:05.700> eyeshadow<00:05:06.180> which<00:05:07.050> is<00:05:07.320> kind<00:05:07.680> of<00:05:07.800> you

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
on the eyeshadow which is kind of you

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.400 
on the eyeshadow which is kind of you
know<00:05:09.140> annoying

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
know annoying

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.830 
know annoying
now<00:05:11.220> like<00:05:11.400> I<00:05:11.520> said<00:05:11.580> some<00:05:12.270> of<00:05:12.390> them<00:05:12.540> are

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
now like I said some of them are

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.660 
now like I said some of them are
actually<00:05:13.110> most<00:05:13.500> of<00:05:13.620> them<00:05:13.740> are<00:05:13.920> not<00:05:14.130> going<00:05:14.520> to

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:14.670 
actually most of them are not going to

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.940 
actually most of them are not going to
do<00:05:14.790> that<00:05:15.030> trick<00:05:15.330> okay<00:05:15.780> sometimes<00:05:16.500> is<00:05:16.620> going<00:05:16.860> to

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
do that trick okay sometimes is going to

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.030 
do that trick okay sometimes is going to
be<00:05:17.070> harder<00:05:17.550> to<00:05:17.820> get<00:05:18.270> the<00:05:18.900> pants<00:05:19.320> out<00:05:19.530> you<00:05:19.920> know

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
be harder to get the pants out you know

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.310 
be harder to get the pants out you know
depending<00:05:20.550> on<00:05:20.760> which<00:05:21.420> eyeshadow<00:05:21.960> and<00:05:22.170> how

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
depending on which eyeshadow and how

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.830 
depending on which eyeshadow and how
attached<00:05:22.680> they<00:05:22.710> are<00:05:23.340> to<00:05:23.670> the<00:05:24.120> palette<00:05:24.510> so<00:05:24.720> what

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
attached they are to the palette so what

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.510 
attached they are to the palette so what
I<00:05:24.870> do<00:05:24.990> is<00:05:25.290> I<00:05:25.320> actually<00:05:25.530> have<00:05:25.770> some<00:05:25.980> leftover

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
I do is I actually have some leftover

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.660 
I do is I actually have some leftover
magnets<00:05:27.060> and<00:05:27.300> I<00:05:27.930> actually<00:05:28.590> just<00:05:29.040> put<00:05:29.280> this<00:05:29.460> on

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:29.670 
magnets and I actually just put this on

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.730 
magnets and I actually just put this on
top<00:05:29.970> of<00:05:30.030> the<00:05:30.210> color<00:05:30.540> and<00:05:30.870> it<00:05:31.050> lives<00:05:31.320> it<00:05:31.500> because

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
top of the color and it lives it because

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.440 
top of the color and it lives it because
there<00:05:31.890> are<00:05:31.950> four<00:05:32.190> strong<00:05:32.520> magnets<00:05:32.970> that<00:05:33.090> live

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
there are four strong magnets that live

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.120 
there are four strong magnets that live
to<00:05:33.600> the<00:05:33.780> palate<00:05:34.170> and<00:05:34.290> it<00:05:34.740> comes<00:05:34.920> out<00:05:35.070> really

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
to the palate and it comes out really
