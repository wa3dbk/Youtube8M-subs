00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.750 

and<00:02:32.610> then<00:02:32.940> what<00:02:33.420> to<00:02:33.540> do<00:02:33.690> that<00:02:33.950> do<00:02:34.950> G<00:02:35.310> power

and then what to do that do G power
chord<00:02:36.260> whence<00:02:37.260> in<00:02:37.349> this<00:02:37.500> case<00:02:37.769> risk<00:02:38.099> and<00:02:38.340> I'm

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
chord whence in this case risk and I'm

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.040

basically<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.970> same<00:02:39.209> thing<00:02:39.510> on<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.840> third

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
basically the same thing on the third

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.650 
basically the same thing on the third
fret<00:02:40.730> but<00:02:41.730> our<00:02:41.849> first<00:02:42.090> thing<00:02:42.269> on<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.420> third

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
fret but our first thing on the third

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.000 
fret but our first thing on the third
fret<00:02:42.900> but<00:02:43.140> this<00:02:43.379> happens<00:02:43.620> on<00:02:43.739> the<00:02:43.830> E<00:02:43.860> string

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
fret but this happens on the E string

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.550 
fret but this happens on the E string
and<00:02:44.610> you<00:02:45.150> put<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.540> other<00:02:45.660> two<00:02:45.780> fingers<00:02:46.140> on<00:02:46.530> the

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
and you put the other two fingers on the

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:54.660 
and you put the other two fingers on the
a<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.400> D<00:02:47.430> string<00:02:47.879> so<00:02:48.569> it<00:02:48.629> was<00:02:48.810> like

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:12.580 

so<00:02:55.670> let's<00:02:56.390> do<00:02:56.540> this<00:02:56.630> slowly<00:02:56.840> you<00:02:57.500> guys

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:34.220 

heed<00:03:13.940> me<00:03:14.940> go

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.430 

that's<00:03:34.860> verse<00:03:35.510> then<00:03:36.510> you<00:03:36.629> go<00:03:36.750> into<00:03:36.900> the<00:03:37.140> horse

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
that's verse then you go into the horse

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.530 
that's verse then you go into the horse
where<00:03:37.830> those<00:03:38.069> bases<00:03:38.640> face<00:03:38.940> the<00:03:39.120> same<00:03:39.330> thing

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
where those bases face the same thing

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:56.610 
where those bases face the same thing
actually

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.970
