00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.970
 break 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.610
 like 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.020
 6.3 liters v8 amg control unit is plugged 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:12.560
 in there again 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.940
 first provisionally why because mister 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.320
 berlemann just got the vmax out 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.630
 why did you do that? 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:23.479
 I show the diagram to the front 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:25.070
 wonderful to the vehicle just in the 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:31.640
 fifth gear measured as you can see here 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:34.190
 at 5,750 rpm is the end 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.390
 because we prove in a format I can 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.770
 here and now change in 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:43.069
 speed and then we watch 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:45.759
 240,000 falls measured 240 to 250 sets 

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:49.600
 the vmax 1 we have a power of 4 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:52.690
 148 hp just given cars with 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.130
 That's why one does not speak too little ne 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.350
 calculate that league we have now the 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.119
 vmax be taken out again now 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.500
 measure because have much bigger 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.560
 speed band then we will probably 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.600
 to the 500 ps come but for that must 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.420
 vmax does not know the customer 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:12.310
 I already bought 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.310
 we watch something get along fine 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.860
 spill yet 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.540
 yildiz training ahead we have now 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.000
 times just be wrong first by good 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.610
 made out of because we now too 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.120
 but could turn off anyway 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.890
 have little water 517 514 euro the 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.570
 I think that's still very humane 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.790
 the amg it is known who it is 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.330
 Little knows that the scatter and 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.330
 names 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:20.820
 Here you can see the vmax again 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:26.040
 it was at just 240 so 250 euros 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:37.500
 and now 200 euro are just under 300 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:44.700
 fifth gear 057 net will be running data 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:49.740
 written what are you doing there was 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:04:07.380
 already said human data with bdm 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:04:09.830
 on the processor and then it goes off 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.830
 allows 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.770
 so 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:51.860
 live doing bbm cls 63 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:56.570
 what did we say and have now 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:59.210
 we see 498 and 563 609 up again 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.130
 also nice the curve but for comparison 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.230
 then here is the wonderful with the 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.730
 Formaxx that you have four 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.410
 48 because yes the formation act up to the 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.990
 measure the end 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:13.620
 So even the sucker is still working 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:17.540
 Although his 514 has more power for you 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:22.940
 should not have reached but it 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:26.040
 makes itself noticeable to the backhaus 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:28.380
 after brake well you liked it 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.300
 then as always a thumb comments 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.600
 to subordinate 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.600
 until the 1st
