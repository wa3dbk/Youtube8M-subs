00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.850
 Hello dear friends, Swami Liebert 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.680
 us today we will analyze 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.460
 on the aspect of the game namely crew training 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.049
 aircraft and so what 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.570
 fighter pilot for effective play 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.310
 Firstly, resilience to overloads is 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.779
 most important skill as it cuts 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.790
 quality time here then overloads on 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.080
 the pilot's body accordingly 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.779
 steep turns or at high speeds 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.830
 you will be able to control the plane better 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.130
 relevant to the absolute majority 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.380
 machines in the second review why the review is not 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.060
 vigilance everything just gives a review 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.800
 opportunity to see the enemy from the bottom side 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.700
 in the back in general any planes 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.380
 regarding aircraft 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.720
 which is very important for passive 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.550
 contact detection for example you fly 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.160
 four kilometers look ahead a 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.440
 down at the ground and so flies junkers 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.090
 if the pilot's view is well pumped by the marker 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.000
 will appear on junkers independence from 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.829
 whether the bath looked him or not 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.120
 third course eyesight thanks to her 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.309
 we can exclude contacts that 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.780
 enter our sector of view very 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.589
 useful thing when you gain height 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.330
 and get your contacts glued last 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.560
 queue rocking and stamina this 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.970
 feature gives you the opportunity 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.450
 to withstand large time overloads 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.320
 nice bonus for a hard fight 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.880
 vitality in my opinion without useful 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.620
 the skill can only be rocked 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.880
 nothing to do 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.040
 as for terrestrial listen there everything 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.240
 just pumping parallel speed 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.130
 repair and reload speed 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.290
 so they were about the same 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.299
 values ​​give preference to speed 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.700
 repair this skill some cases 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.049
 saves from the best 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.299
 gun care pump out the last 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.159
 the turn of the new is not that useless but 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.229
 for fish, sbn is basically not necessary 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.240
 relevance is noticeable only in the arcade 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.189
 whole he helps longer alive not 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.750
 the trigger if you have a plane 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.399
 machine guns then here it is 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.060
 a little easier shooting you and 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:51.409
 destroy targets let's 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.409
 demonstrate your version of pumping 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.230
 Slovaks all let's test them 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.010
 influence take the crew with 0 half 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.110
 full pumping 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.910
 compare repair time 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.300
 overload and clamping time 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.300
 trigger bolts 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.620
 and since you see the difference quite 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.970
 sensible summarize for the pilot 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.980
 fighter's most important skill 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.260
 is sustainability overloading it you 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.550
 should pump as often as possible further 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.530
 There is a review that makes our lives 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.060
 simpler and last important skill 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.560
 is vigilance as it gives 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.650
 the ability to light enemies at distant 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.730
 distances and sector to your review 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.520
 other skills to pump and on your 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.620
 discretion on this all hope I 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.480
 explain in detail the benefits of pumping with you 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.200
 was virtus support work like and 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.460
 by subscription 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.460
 Good luck to you all!
