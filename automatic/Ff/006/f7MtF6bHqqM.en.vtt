00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:07.440
 Alexander I represent hello I 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.370
 click today I will introduce you to this 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.920
 video solution how to get rid of 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:17.090
 three red lights from overheating our 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:21.390
 gaming console xbox 360 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:23.189
 There are several options about how this 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.250
 this get rid of it writes in 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:31.650
 everything comes to the internet that 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:36.780
 wrap some cloth or there 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:42.510
 towel wet ixbox 360 before 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:48.629
 that replace the fans in the cooler on 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:50.940
 our 360 from so far from laptops even here 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.390
 either installed there install 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:58.320
 additional cooling also with 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:01.910
 computers there at Spock here but I 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:06.570
 I offer you more 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:11.549
 so simple and maybe certainly not 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:14.040
 so cheap deprivation but still so well 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:21.869
 Well now I will put where flies here 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:25.590
 Here is an example I think not many will understand that 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:29.009
 that's it, yes, I'll tell you now what it is 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.820
 This is a cooling pad where the fuck 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.350
 multi-core 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.020
 x8 for a laptop 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.859
 I think 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:41.079
 many will even now notice that 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:42.850
 surface and top of this 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:43.710
 cooling pad made of 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:51.539
 aluminum 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:54.789
 which is very them so that allows coverage 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:58.630
 carry a large amount through 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:05.610
 heat that is serves as a radiator + 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:09.640
 On ours there is no plus in our device 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:12.299
 stand four fans with a capacity of 1300 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.620
 p p m that is, it is the speed of rotation 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:16.360
 fan 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.049
 well, and accordingly , many have guessed 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:23.310
 how to use this thing just put 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.310
 on her xbox 360 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:41.530
 preferably in the center so that the fan and 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:44.760
 covered the bottom of our xbox 360 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.440
 just central like here here to 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.750
 most fans blew it 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.139
 Here in this part only on the other hand 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:57.310
 because it is almost in the middle 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:03:04.349
 is our process and video chip 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:11.170
 xbox and accordingly this stand 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:14.500
 connects via usb cable holders 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:19.049
 fat version how do i connect 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.049
 can connect through this port 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:36.110
 only through the front since exactly 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.390
 request for a standard cable 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:57.770
 which goes picking fit 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:59.050
 only he including our guests every 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.970
 outlet and 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:05.510
 in this case for the fact that food 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:08.360
 fed to the front entrance usb constantly 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.450
 box 360 so the fans will 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:16.160
 spinning constantly what seems to me 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:19.340
 a little bit strange but the owners are blue and 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:23.470
 even e versions of new ones that came out completely 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:27.020
 recently can connect yusb input from behind 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:30.560
 here's a standard cable for fat owners 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:34.730
 either in front or buy another cable 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:37.940
 more with a thinner input well in 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:40.120
 Basically, that's all I wanted for you. 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.120
 to tell 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.260
 In principle, this solution seems to me 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.260
 pretty practical because a 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:52.610
 the cost is data coasters 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:56.870
 makes 1800 rubles to dns shop 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:59.540
 Now it seems to me very well, or a simple 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:04.810
 what each user can do and 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:04.810
 gamer of our xbox 360 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.100
