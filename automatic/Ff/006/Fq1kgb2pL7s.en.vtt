00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.730
 immediate with a net paper chute that 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.610

 its gallops by left band but 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.949
 after a double wall with zidane and

 and so it came to the end of the first 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.390
 part 10 for Real Madrid 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.400
 after the more than necessary break the

 second part started with a diaphanous 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.640
 opportunity to fix Vaseline light

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.150
 extraordinary peruzzi 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.370
 second delivery more entertaining as 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.890
 this chute edgar davis that forced the

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.050
 warned the rain and in the equator of 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.210
 this second montero act marked 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.530
 empty door after a good play 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.730

 takes advantage of dani garcía to give him the 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.090
 spherical to Ivan Perez 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.130
 twenty-one 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.020

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.170
 Real Madrid legends with this volley of 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.170
 Zidane 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.720
 or the shot to the crossbar of emilio 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.720
 butragueño on the edge of the conclusion 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.580
 total 21 won the Real Madrid- but what 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.370
 more important is that everything collected 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.500
 in the game will go to the campaign 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.490
