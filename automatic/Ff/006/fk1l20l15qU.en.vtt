 [Music] 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.750
 but no 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.660
 like this, almost all the cattle refuse 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.230
 to enter the sacrificial room as he 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:29.699
 know 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:29.699
 [Music] 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.210
 [Applause] 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:43.120
 to force or not all will enter the 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.120
 corral just await your time 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.460
 this is the municipal trail of apopa 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.310
 is one of the 87 that work in the 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.520
 country and that could be improved with the 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.270
 central government plan we are very 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.369
 wrong 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.429
 that means that the killing in the 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:15.719
 country is polluting is of low quality 

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:15.719
 in terms of health 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.390
 obviously they are not the best 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.330
 conditions in which this is done 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.160
 work but with the announcement many of the 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.160
 apopa workers fear for their 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:34.810
 Some jobs came here after 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.810
 Mexicans will close 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.240
 not for me 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.909
 that flew 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.270
 that's what all remodeling benefits 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.270
 a remodeling 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.350
 for here 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.230
 it is good that there is better 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.660
 we need 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.760
 who work on the apopa trail 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.700
 just of the ones we found just wait 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:08.430
 that the improvements are for the benefit of 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.320
 all included that this generates more 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:13.400
 jobs 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.400
