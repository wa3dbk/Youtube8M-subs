00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.949
 ah 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.139
 hello guys from previous companies their 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.300
 It is clear that you are ready to 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.040
 hamelin is the information logic and the 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.320
 today's video I will teach you how to do this 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.330
 box shaped camera that is a bench 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.490
 us hundreds of movies in camera 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.619
 daydream so it's always all to 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.619
 see how I do it right in this video 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:34.740
 Y 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.450
 and what we are going to present is 222 of 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.270
 cardboard with this shape they have to 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.190
 measure the same then another elongated that 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.649
 it will be the base 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.840
 and two smaller squares for the 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.130
 lateral 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.130
 it has to be the same size 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.620
 and then we're going to paste all the 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.100
 indicated in the hot as believing in 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.100
 the picture 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.340
 we go 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.600
 for the trap we are going to need these 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.369
 pieces of cardboard that have the same 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.130
 way in size they have to be more 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.170
 long that the lid of the box what is 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.210
 the box then we need pieces of 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.969
 cardboard that will be the sides and this 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.730
 that will be to cover the box not the 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:44.220
 front 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.650
 and well we went to round everything to 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.960
 that later it is easier to paste it with 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.010
 silicone give it the shape of the lid and 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.770
 over here we will continue the same 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.020
 procedure than before with silicone 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.360
 hot you give all the parties have 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.740
 that you have cardboard left over somewhere not 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.900
 worry because then once you 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.850
 everything is stuck we can cut it and 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.850
 align everything with scissors 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.770
 and good guys, that's how they have 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.560
 remained armed everything that is the 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.300
 cover and cardboard box 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.250
 then we do all the 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.530
 details of a cardboard also for 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.110
 form what the camera is and they have to 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.110
 do it in a size that is consistent with 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.840
 the size of our box and good as 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.550
 you see what we are going to do all these 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.800
 little pieces that will be the parts of our 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.340
 camera 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.340
 the buttons 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.700
 As you can see here, it 's like we have to 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.530
 stay and well then let's paint the 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.080
 interior of the house with this extracts in 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.290
 fuchsia pink and we will paint it 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:13.049
 for how the infinities extend 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.879
 we let it dry for half an hour more 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.549
 or less until it is dry and out 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.140
 we are going to paper not with this paper 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:22.040
 black adhesive that gives you as a touch 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.510
 more real and as if it were more plastic 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.939
 so let's go to it and let's go 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.239
 papering parts by part as you are 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:29.239
 seeing 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.799
 ah 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.180
 somehow we're going to go papering 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.280
 what is the lid and our box 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.739
 we have to be very careful not to 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.900
 the reds were used so go sticking 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.460
 what you are seeing with path is 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.440
 the truth was very perfect but 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.870
 webb we can not get so many 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.450
 wrinkles and good once then everything 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.620
 wallpaper, we are going to do them now 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.900
 sticking to our parts and we're going to 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:36.640
 do also with hot silicone and 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.640
 as well as how is it going 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.780
 do not 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.020
 now to stick the goal and be more 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.849
 real let's hit what is the edge 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.580
 with hot silicone and we're going to stick it 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:00.039
 on a transparent sheet of these from 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.960
 plastic that are used for binding 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:05.300
 books books all that we 're going to 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.120
 paste to give that crystal effect 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.919
 or to say that you are and then let's go 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.110
 trimming the remainder and then 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:14.530
 we continue to stick it like everything 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.530
 previous 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.440
 and good guys that's how he has 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.820
 remained the truth that has been very 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.410
 pretty at least at the central level 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.630
 result and then you can do the 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.790
 details with white paint with the mars 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.590
 white nails too and good guys 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.450
