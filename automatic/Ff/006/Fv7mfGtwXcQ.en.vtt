you do a video and say exposed then that

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.810 
you do a video and say exposed then that
person<00:00:51.270> has<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.809> leave<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.199> internet<00:00:52.820> that's

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
to my understanding I mean maybe I'm way

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.080 
to my understanding I mean maybe I'm way
off<00:00:55.649> here<00:00:55.920> somebody<00:00:56.280> can<00:00:56.399> explain<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.969> me

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
off here somebody can explain it to me

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.729 
off here somebody can explain it to me
in<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.239> comments<00:00:57.600> section<00:00:57.629> but<00:00:58.050> when<00:00:58.620> you

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
come up with some kind of bullshit put

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.599 
come up with some kind of bullshit put
it<00:01:01.020> in<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.199> video<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.590> put<00:01:01.739> exposed<00:01:02.280> in<00:01:02.579> the

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
it in a video and put exposed in the

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.479 
it in a video and put exposed in the
title<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.470> person<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.769> have<00:01:04.949> exposed

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
title that person that you have exposed

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.880 
title that person that you have exposed
has<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:06.030> leave<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.299> Internet's<00:01:06.890> forever

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
has to leave the Internet's forever

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.789 
has to leave the Internet's forever
never<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.000> be<00:01:09.180> seen<00:01:09.360> again<00:01:09.530> never<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.680> be<00:01:10.770> heard

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
never to be seen again never to be heard

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.969 
never to be seen again never to be heard
from<00:01:10.920> again<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:12.570> this<00:01:12.780> exposure<00:01:13.290> will

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
from again and so this exposure will

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.859 
from again and so this exposure will
hopefully<00:01:14.189> get<00:01:15.060> rid<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.299> one<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.600> those

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
hopefully get rid of one of those

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.190 
hopefully get rid of one of those
internet<00:01:16.619> creepers<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:18.030> black<00:01:18.780> bond

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
internet creepers and that is black bond

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.800 
internet creepers and that is black bond
