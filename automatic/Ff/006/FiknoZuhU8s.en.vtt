pretty<00:01:33.130> crazy<00:01:33.430> stats<00:01:33.789> she<00:01:34.719> has<00:01:34.840> 64<00:01:35.409> strength

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:35.859 
pretty crazy stats she has 64 strength

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:37.800 
pretty crazy stats she has 64 strength
as<00:01:36.070> well<00:01:36.100> which<00:01:36.520> is<00:01:36.820> definitely<00:01:37.149> it<00:01:37.600> feels

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
as well which is definitely it feels

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.929 
as well which is definitely it feels
higher<00:01:38.049> in<00:01:38.289> game<00:01:38.530> and<00:01:38.770> so<00:01:39.310> he's<00:01:39.490> able<00:01:39.609> to<00:01:39.759> hold

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
higher in game and so he's able to hold

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:41.310 
higher in game and so he's able to hold
off<00:01:40.090> players<00:01:40.299> really<00:01:40.509> well<00:01:40.750> but<00:01:40.899> the<00:01:41.020> thing<00:01:41.200> I

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
off players really well but the thing I

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.660 
off players really well but the thing I
want<00:01:41.469> to<00:01:41.560> talk<00:01:41.740> about<00:01:41.770> the<00:01:42.100> most<00:01:42.399> is<00:01:42.640> a

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
want to talk about the most is a

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.660 
want to talk about the most is a
shooting<00:01:43.350> specifically<00:01:44.350> his<00:01:44.619> shot<00:01:44.950> power<00:01:45.219> and

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
shooting specifically his shot power and

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.240 
shooting specifically his shot power and
finesse<00:01:45.909> shots<00:01:46.420> long<00:01:47.259> shot<00:01:47.500> wide<00:01:47.710> shot<00:01:48.039> I

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
finesse shots long shot wide shot I

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.300 
finesse shots long shot wide shot I
believe<00:01:48.640> 93<00:01:49.420> shop<00:01:49.719> our<00:01:49.960> 91<00:01:50.619> long<00:01:50.799> shots<00:01:51.100> maybe

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
believe 93 shop our 91 long shots maybe

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.249 
believe 93 shop our 91 long shots maybe
it's<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.609> opposite<00:01:52.030> but<00:01:52.179> either<00:01:52.329> way<00:01:52.570> crazy

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
it's the opposite but either way crazy

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.410 
it's the opposite but either way crazy
stats<00:01:53.619> and<00:01:53.859> he<00:01:53.920> does<00:01:54.130> live<00:01:54.369> up<00:01:54.520> to<00:01:54.700> them<00:01:54.850> he<00:01:55.270> can

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
stats and he does live up to them he can

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.910 
stats and he does live up to them he can
score<00:01:55.659> from<00:01:55.719> really<00:01:56.140> far<00:01:56.170> out<00:01:56.350> consistently

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
score from really far out consistently

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.219 
score from really far out consistently
and<00:01:57.490> his<00:01:57.999> phoenicia<00:01:58.420> to<00:01:58.749> pretty<00:01:58.960> much<00:01:59.049> the

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
and his phoenicia to pretty much the

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.679 
and his phoenicia to pretty much the
same<00:01:59.380> thing<00:01:59.439> I<00:01:59.770> can<00:02:00.130> score<00:02:00.369> from<00:02:00.399> 34<00:02:01.179> yards<00:02:01.509> out

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:01.689 
same thing I can score from 34 yards out

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:03.840 
same thing I can score from 34 yards out
and<00:02:01.929> something<00:02:02.859> about<00:02:02.890> the<00:02:03.159> gameplay<00:02:03.310> I<00:02:03.640> did

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
and something about the gameplay I did

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.160 
and something about the gameplay I did
lose<00:02:04.030> some<00:02:04.210> of<00:02:04.240> the<00:02:04.390> footage<00:02:04.600> so<00:02:04.810> I<00:02:04.869> don't<00:02:05.049> have

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
lose some of the footage so I don't have

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.779 
lose some of the footage so I don't have
all<00:02:05.380> the<00:02:05.530> goals<00:02:05.740> I<00:02:05.979> am<00:02:06.100> missing<00:02:06.429> some<00:02:06.609> of<00:02:06.700> the

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
all the goals I am missing some of the

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:08.460 
all the goals I am missing some of the
really<00:02:06.939> good<00:02:07.149> ones<00:02:07.210> but<00:02:07.990> hopefully<00:02:08.289> they'll

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
really good ones but hopefully they'll

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.020 
really good ones but hopefully they'll
be<00:02:08.590> enough<00:02:08.830> to<00:02:08.979> show<00:02:09.159> you<00:02:09.220> just<00:02:09.580> what<00:02:09.789> he<00:02:09.849> can

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
be enough to show you just what he can

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.070 
be enough to show you just what he can
do<00:02:10.179> consistently<00:02:10.989> curling<00:02:11.739> in

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
do consistently curling in

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.560 
do consistently curling in
you<00:02:12.320> know<00:02:12.410> 30<00:02:12.800> 20<00:02:13.430> yard<00:02:13.640> whatever<00:02:14.240> you<00:02:14.480> know

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
you know 30 20 yard whatever you know

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.720 
you know 30 20 yard whatever you know
however<00:02:15.020> long<00:02:15.290> it<00:02:15.440> is<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:16.100> net<00:02:16.280> shot<00:02:16.430> just

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
however long it is the net shot just

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.130 
however long it is the net shot just
seemed<00:02:16.880> to<00:02:16.940> go<00:02:17.030> in<00:02:17.210> every<00:02:17.330> time<00:02:17.660> he<00:02:17.780> doesn't

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
seemed to go in every time he doesn't

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.110 
seemed to go in every time he doesn't
miss<00:02:18.260> that<00:02:18.500> often<00:02:18.920> and<00:02:19.250> hopefully<00:02:19.820> you'll<00:02:19.940> see

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
miss that often and hopefully you'll see

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.460 
miss that often and hopefully you'll see
that<00:02:20.240> a<00:02:20.300> little<00:02:20.600> bit<00:02:20.690> and<00:02:20.900> it's<00:02:21.200> definitely

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
that a little bit and it's definitely

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.350 
that a little bit and it's definitely
the<00:02:21.680> biggest<00:02:21.860> strength<00:02:22.190> about<00:02:22.550> him<00:02:22.610> but<00:02:23.240> the

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
the biggest strength about him but the

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.120 
the biggest strength about him but the
two<00:02:23.540> things<00:02:23.810> that<00:02:23.900> complement<00:02:24.560> that<00:02:24.620> strength

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
two things that complement that strength

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.670 
two things that complement that strength
of<00:02:25.310> his<00:02:25.430> very<00:02:25.760> very<00:02:26.090> well<00:02:26.420> or<00:02:26.720> my<00:02:27.110> opinion<00:02:27.560> his

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
of his very very well or my opinion his

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.100 
of his very very well or my opinion his
acceleration<00:02:28.310> and<00:02:28.610> his<00:02:28.730> dribbling<00:02:29.210> now<00:02:29.840> his

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
acceleration and his dribbling now his

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.470 
acceleration and his dribbling now his
acceleration<00:02:30.770> has<00:02:31.010> got<00:02:31.190> either<00:02:31.310> 92<00:02:31.850> or<00:02:31.880> 93<00:02:32.120> I

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
acceleration has got either 92 or 93 I

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.750 
acceleration has got either 92 or 93 I
believe<00:02:32.810> on<00:02:33.020> his<00:02:33.170> card<00:02:33.560> maybe<00:02:33.770> even<00:02:34.010> 94<00:02:34.520> and

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
believe on his card maybe even 94 and

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.730 
believe on his card maybe even 94 and
you<00:02:35.210> can<00:02:35.360> definitely<00:02:35.480> feel<00:02:35.810> it<00:02:35.870> in<00:02:36.140> game<00:02:36.350> that

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
you can definitely feel it in game that

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.680 
you can definitely feel it in game that
combined<00:02:37.250> with<00:02:37.340> his<00:02:37.610> actual<00:02:38.270> physical

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
combined with his actual physical

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.420 
combined with his actual physical
strength<00:02:39.080> allows<00:02:39.650> them<00:02:39.830> to<00:02:39.860> run<00:02:40.070> down<00:02:40.280> the

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
strength allows them to run down the

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.580 
strength allows them to run down the
line<00:02:40.640> with<00:02:40.790> ease<00:02:41.090> and<00:02:41.270> then<00:02:41.840> another<00:02:42.170> thing<00:02:42.440> to

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
line with ease and then another thing to

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.500 
line with ease and then another thing to
add<00:02:42.740> to<00:02:42.770> that<00:02:42.950> is<00:02:43.220> his<00:02:43.340> dribbling<00:02:43.880> you<00:02:44.390> know

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
add to that is his dribbling you know

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.210 
add to that is his dribbling you know
he's<00:02:44.690> got<00:02:44.720> very<00:02:45.110> good<00:02:45.230> dribbling<00:02:45.860> it's<00:02:46.070> not

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
he's got very good dribbling it's not

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.010 
he's got very good dribbling it's not
the<00:02:46.370> greatest<00:02:46.670> but<00:02:46.940> you<00:02:47.300> know<00:02:47.390> six<00:02:47.690> foot<00:02:47.870> tall

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
the greatest but you know six foot tall

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.420 
the greatest but you know six foot tall
is<00:02:48.200> really<00:02:48.500> quick<00:02:48.650> it's<00:02:48.800> got<00:02:48.950> great<00:02:49.100> shooting

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
is really quick it's got great shooting

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.220 
is really quick it's got great shooting
so<00:02:49.760> not<00:02:50.360> really<00:02:50.510> too<00:02:50.720> worried<00:02:50.930> about<00:02:51.080> is

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
so not really too worried about is

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.720 
so not really too worried about is
dribbling<00:02:51.440> but<00:02:51.740> one<00:02:52.130> of<00:02:52.190> the<00:02:52.340> best<00:02:52.520> things

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
dribbling but one of the best things

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.520 
dribbling but one of the best things
that<00:02:52.790> you<00:02:52.880> can<00:02:52.970> do<00:02:53.209> with<00:02:53.240> him<00:02:53.510> is<00:02:53.690> just<00:02:54.020> sprint

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
that you can do with him is just sprint

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.260 
that you can do with him is just sprint
down<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:54.860> line<00:02:55.040> people<00:02:55.580> will<00:02:55.700> often<00:02:55.880> think

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
down the line people will often think

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.300 
down the line people will often think
that<00:02:56.330> you're<00:02:56.570> going<00:02:56.690> to<00:02:56.750> cross<00:02:56.959> and<00:02:57.320> just<00:02:58.010> cut

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
that you're going to cross and just cut

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.890 
that you're going to cross and just cut
in<00:02:58.520> or<00:02:58.700> you<00:02:58.790> can<00:02:58.940> do<00:02:59.030> a<00:02:59.060> skill<00:02:59.420> movie<00:02:59.630> it<00:02:59.750> does

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
in or you can do a skill movie it does

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.449 
in or you can do a skill movie it does
have<00:03:00.110> forced<00:03:00.440> our<00:03:00.590> skills<00:03:00.950> which<00:03:01.160> is<00:03:01.280> very

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
it definitely could be worse you know

playing them as a left midfielder those
were<00:03:32.390> crates<00:03:32.600> are<00:03:32.780> very<00:03:32.959> good<00:03:33.170> in<00:03:33.230> my<00:03:33.410> opinion

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
were crates are very good in my opinion

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.190 
were crates are very good in my opinion
for<00:03:33.920> that<00:03:34.010> position<00:03:34.160> but<00:03:35.090> as<00:03:35.300> a<00:03:35.360> left<00:03:35.870> winger<00:03:36.050> I

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
for that position but as a left winger I

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.199 
for that position but as a left winger I
would<00:03:36.440> definitely<00:03:36.590> prefer<00:03:36.890> high<00:03:37.550> medium<00:03:38.090> or

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
would definitely prefer high medium or

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:39.759 
would definitely prefer high medium or
high<00:03:38.390> low<00:03:38.660> and<00:03:38.900> he<00:03:39.230> does<00:03:39.410> get<00:03:39.560> caught<00:03:39.739> a

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
high low and he does get caught a

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.860 
high low and he does get caught a
position<00:03:40.280> occasionally<00:03:41.000> but<00:03:41.510> really<00:03:41.840> I

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
position occasionally but really I

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
position occasionally but really I
wouldn't<00:03:42.140> worry<00:03:42.290> about<00:03:42.320> that<00:03:42.500> too<00:03:42.860> much

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
wouldn't worry about that too much

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.530 
wouldn't worry about that too much
because<00:03:43.340> a<00:03:43.459> lot<00:03:43.700> of<00:03:43.730> players<00:03:44.000> have<00:03:44.120> those<00:03:44.420> were

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
because a lot of players have those were

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.420 
because a lot of players have those were
crates<00:03:44.750> and<00:03:44.989> it's<00:03:45.140> not<00:03:45.320> that<00:03:45.590> noticeable<00:03:45.860> to

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
crates and it's not that noticeable to

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.030 
crates and it's not that noticeable to
be<00:03:46.550> honest<00:03:46.910> so<00:03:47.600> to<00:03:47.720> recap<00:03:47.750> is<00:03:48.260> pros<00:03:48.530> and<00:03:48.709> cons

nine point five or ten out of ten but

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.690 
nine point five or ten out of ten but
the<00:04:09.590> work<00:04:09.769> rates<00:04:09.980> are<00:04:10.100> not<00:04:10.310> that<00:04:10.489> big<00:04:10.670> of

the work rates are not that big of

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
problem in the strengths completely

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.160 
problem in the strengths completely
outweigh<00:04:13.310> his<00:04:13.489> one<00:04:13.730> calling<00:04:14.180> and<00:04:14.930> I<00:04:14.959> think

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
outweigh his one calling and I think

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.719 
outweigh his one calling and I think
that<00:04:15.290> he'd<00:04:15.440> be<00:04:15.530> great<00:04:15.769> as<00:04:15.890> a<00:04:15.920> left<00:04:16.220> mid<00:04:16.430> left

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
that he'd be great as a left mid left

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:19.000 
that he'd be great as a left mid left
wing<00:04:16.970> or<00:04:17.180> left<00:04:17.209> word<00:04:17.810> but<00:04:18.290> that's<00:04:18.500> all<00:04:18.709> for<00:04:18.890> me

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
wing or left word but that's all for me

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.830 
wing or left word but that's all for me
I<00:04:19.190> hope<00:04:19.459> you<00:04:19.609> enjoyed<00:04:19.850> the<00:04:19.880> video<00:04:20.180> and<00:04:20.479> have<00:04:20.810> a
