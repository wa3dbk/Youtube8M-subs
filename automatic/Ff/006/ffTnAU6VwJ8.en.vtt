00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.839
 Ashok mouth did not offend the wars on these came to stay clear of this 

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:07.250
 the boss is posted 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.420
 at these two, the healers focus exclusively on them 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.420
 take care that dement Enke stays alive 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.880
 The first difficulty is directly at the Breul Predrag Lostrommel bus 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.450
 that's easy on the Tankan us-commands, too 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.449
 at the same time correctly posed that requires 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:31.980
 the idea behind this tactic 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.530
 who by train 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.890
 Again, the world should stay out of sight of the boss 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.730
 at least temporarily 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.440
 Commandos had in total 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.370
 Special attacks are available for about every instance z 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.460
 two randomly selected 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.160
 So they get to do it with each combination with a different combination 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.090
 Explaining any special attacks would lead you to read too far 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.090
 Kraichgau 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.360
 every 30 seconds, Commodus uses them alternately saying 

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.710
 In most attacks that means having the environment 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.630
 Pull back the chamber and wait until the attack 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.860
 sda else gives 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.430
 At this point we now want the hardest to counterattack the attack 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.470
 come on 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.030
 commands enter the entire world for 8 seconds and reduce them 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.730
 acute men fight 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.760
 for the Mac that meant by no means content and 2 healers 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.050
 they all run in their tracks 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.490
 come herefrom 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.290
 this automatically attacks the second war Carnevale adds duration of the attack 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:34.310
 attracts attention 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.940
 as far as a story is tangible again is the actual recipient 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.440
 this tactic when at this point 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.680
 it takes depends but every time participates HQ awarded 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.930
 like the maximum two or three times well then the two teams have the 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.549
 change seats 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:13.439
 that would not be enough, they each have to be the giant 

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:16.110
 regularly cover with the inviting shot 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.929
 everyone can do it you have to have the most imaginable players 

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:21.929
 Effects of curses to magical ones that linger there 

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:27.909
 It is a very difficult fight that requires a near perfect coordination 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:29.709
 to make no mistakes 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.709
 and on top of that with a minimum duration of just under ten minutes very long 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:36.640
 set yourself on a longer learning phase before the big 50 ins 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:39.639
 Grass bites 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.049
 So Bern wants to swing last post SP arrived today the black 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:49.459
 Dragon the holidays 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.810
 the OFC at the beginning in human form on his throne makes our work difficult 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:53.590
 add 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.590
 or he will try 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:04.799
 the best known two phases divided the first you see here the holidays themselves 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.329
 Do not do a little bit of work here, too, and put the players in front of Shadow 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:11.590
 However, the book raises the actual problem, however, are the three customers 

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:14.819
 lie down in two places to stop the players 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.289
 When I have commands there are different types of this track Uni the 

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:19.980
 each with their own skills 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.479
 two of them will be impacted each week 

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:26.539
 Explaining the tactics for all combinations would be the framework of this 

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:30.299
 Therefore, a video blow up at this point is brief and concise they have to 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:31.999
 the Takumi kill those 

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:35.109
 you will find further details in the complete solution in the rear 

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:48.169
 Once a certain number of track Olive Death start Phase 2 gardeners 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:51.139
 Florian himself a big performance he wins with it 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:53.469
 no shadows flames 

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:57.069
 it was fight not his calamity her dandruff hand put dies dies 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:59.009
 her immediately 

00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:00.679
 because most of the blame 

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:04.239
 the remaining inquisitive fights the male with some healers 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:04.950
 on the way 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.349
 Correctly place a round holiday 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.329
 the alliance side should play a dwarf as soon as possible 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:14.149
 Priest the CFOs spell protection on the Templeton 

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:17.840
 because the holidays regularly use fear is clean knows who in contrast 

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:20.839
 Now the fight will be a lot easier 

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:27.519
 actually, the fight in phase two would be very straightforward would not be the 

00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:32.340
 so-called clear scouts every 30 seconds Florian cursed a random 

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:36.430
 selected class with a certain effect the sharks magic of priests 

00:04:36.429 --> 00:04:40.129
 For example, Druids need to be dangerous curses at this time 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:43.519
 and paladins or shamans take over the healing of the management 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:52.860
 in the case of Maria Kau who is here to be seen because randomly selected players 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.860
 transformed and Eric notes so to caresses 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:06.539
 Once you have the transition from Phase 1 to Phase 2 under control and know 

00:05:07.059 --> 00:05:11.129
 how to respond to the individual Claas Kautz are the biggest hurdles 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:12.300
 took 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.650
 this one was one 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.500
 because they drop to 20 percent of his life energy, he has revived 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.190
 all in stage one killed track this again the thing world then 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.490
 attack 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.800
 every one of these undead is no great danger to the sheer mass 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.430
 but already 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.690
 by Marion Warlock the kings of helping damage 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.690
 they have to be on Zack 

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:09.360
 so jumped 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.360
 by Michael Schulte MÃ¼nster 

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:20.499
 if they have survived, nothing can go wrong 

00:06:20.499 --> 00:06:24.289
 hold on and they have the once heaviest opponent only 4 

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:25.129
 Cross defeated
