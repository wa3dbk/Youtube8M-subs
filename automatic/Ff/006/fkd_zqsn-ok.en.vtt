00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.090
 the creepy pastas are ready 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.340
 promised now it only takes 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.429
 upload them 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.560
 or the one that's good after a couple of 

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:20.229
 days I finished the creepy pastas that 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.109
 I promised them today the second episode of 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.329
 lost episodes how bad that sounds 

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:27.969
 I hope this episode is not lost ha ha 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:31.119
 will you wonder how I ended up so 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:33.280
 fast the creepy pastas good first 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.649
 because with one I did copypaste and second 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.230
 because I did not have classes ha ha ha the 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:41.660
 Today's episode is from Harvard 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.550
 foxx has a very strange way to 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.070
 tell the episodes of the simpsons 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.200
 they refused to count a few 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.260
 of them making the total amount 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.240
 of episodes the reason is inconsistent 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.330
 of this is for a lost episode of the 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.850
 first season look for details about 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.770
 this lost episode is difficult none 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.050
 of those who worked at that time in 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.790
 the simpsons want to talk about it from 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.560
 how little you have been able to know 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.320
 Lost episode was created totally 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.600
 by matt groening during production 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.210
 of the first season man started to 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.460
 act strangely he was too 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.950
 uneasy and seemed nervous in that 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.750
 then mention this to those who 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.000
 they worked at the time they were made 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.490
 get angry and forbid me to mention this to 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.530
 I loved the first time I heard about this 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.050
 It was at an event where David Silverman 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.270
 he was talking to someone in the audience 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.720
 he asked about the episode and silverman 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.720
 just left the east 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.640
 making the event end some 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.150
 the collection number of this episode 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.800
 it was 706 and its title was dead bar but 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.900
 was replaced later by the 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.360
 episode manning luisa for the years that 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.660
 they do not know what that is where that lisa plays 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.970
 with bleeding gums apart from getting angry 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.680
 at the mere mention of this episode the 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.750
 workers of that time also 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.540
 would do everything possible to avoid 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.580
 contact me with lean in at an event of 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.710
 fans I managed to follow him after 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.390
 talk to the public and so I had the 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.209
 opportunity to talk to him alone 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.430
 outside the building he bothered us 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.260
 absolute surely because I expected 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.810
 meet at the exit with some fan 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.940
 obsessed however when you 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.100
 I mentioned about the lost episode it 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.100
 He turned pale and trembled on the edge of 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.650
 tears took a piece of paper he wrote 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.709
 something in him and he gave it to me he begged me never to 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.540
 more will mention that episode again 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.730
 the episode began as any 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.640
 another but it had an animation quality 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.920
 very 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.930
 if you've seen the original animation of 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.780
 The simpsons will notice that it was similar 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.670
 but the animation was less stable the 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.500
 first act was practically normal 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.810
 but the way in which the characters 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.270
 they were acting was a little strange homero 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.190
 I saw angry depressed marie lisa 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.570
 anxious and bart seemed to have a hatred 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.209
 total towards his parents 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:57.730
 the episode was about the simpsons 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:00.010
 traveling by plane near the end of the 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.870
 first act the plane was going out and bart 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.840
 I sang leisure I walk like I was 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.610
 wait however as the plane was going 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.860
 almost 50 feet tall 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.680
 bard broke a plane window and it was 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.930
 sucked at the beginning of the series 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.640
 he maintained the idea that everyone from 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.680
 the simpsons will represent life 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.079
 everyday and that death would do things 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.570
 more realistic this was used in this 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.760
 episode the image of the body of bart 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.770
 it was barely recognizable they took 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.720
 total advantage that he could not move 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.720
 and they made an almost realistic image of 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:34.330
 his corpse act 1 ends with a 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.760
 body image of bach when the act 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.320
 2 began to put or marielisa were 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.230
 sitting in their chairs 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.270
 crying crying followed and followed every 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.220
 time being more painful and sounding more 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.100
 realistic and better acted than what you 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.140
 could you imagine the performance began 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.720
 to decay while they cried and you could 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:55.180
 listen to murmurs in the background 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.250
 characters were barely distinguishable 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.410
 they widened and became more blurred 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.090
 looking like deformed shadows 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.940
 painted with bright colors 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.860
 random faces were looking through the 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.080
 window but they only appeared in 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.720
 certain fractions of a second so 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.930
 I'm not sure how they were really 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.210
 family cried for the whole act 2 the act 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:19.120
 3 began with a sign that said 1 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.580
 year after putting or marielisa they were 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.520
 almost skeletal and they were still sitting on 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:27.760
 their chairs there were no signs of handling 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:30.160
 the pets they decided to visit the 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.530
 grave of park springfield was 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.750
 completely deserted and while they 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.390
 they walked to the cemetery the houses were 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:40.030
 they came back more and more decrepit all 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:42.160
 they looked abandoned when they arrived at the 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.009
 tomb of val his corpse was thrown 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.020
 right in front 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:48.409
 his grave having the same appearance 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:50.300
 that had at the end of Act 1 the family 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:52.009
 he started crying again and 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.930
 eventually they stopped and they 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:56.479
 limited to observe the body of bart 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:59.389
 the camera makes approach to the face of 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:01.550
 homero according to some people january 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:03.619
 tell a joke in this part but do not 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.479
 it's audible in the version that I saw so 

00:06:03.619 --> 00:06:08.330
 I can not tell you what he really said 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:10.909
 Homero the camera starts to move away 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.649
 while the episode ends 

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:14.899
 gravestones in the background have the names 

00:06:12.649 --> 00:06:16.939
 of all the celebrities who visited the 

00:06:14.899 --> 00:06:20.629
 simpsons even those of whom 

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:22.339
 nobody had listened in 1989 and even 

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:24.949
 some who had not even been 

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:27.409
 still in the show they all had 

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:29.539
 their dates of death for the 

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:31.520
 visits that died now as michael 

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:33.229
 jackson and george harrison dates 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.860
 they were from when they could have 

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:38.599
 dead the credits will be completely 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:41.089
 silent and seemed written by hand 

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:43.849
 the final image was the simpson family 

00:06:41.089 --> 00:06:46.219
 sitting on the couch as in the intro but 

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:48.220
 all drawn very realistically to the 

00:06:46.219 --> 00:06:50.170
 Like the body park 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.360
 a thought came to mind 

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:54.430
 after watching this episode for the first 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.930
 you could try to use the fast ones 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.910
 to predict the deaths of 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:00.040
 stars that visited the simpsons 

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:01.590
 but there is something strange about most 

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:04.050
 of which not yet 

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:06.770
 all their deaths were marked for 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.770
 the same date 

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:12.210
 and so the dead barc ends something curious 

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.220
 of the end where it says that all the 

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:16.350
 dates were marked for the same 

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:18.890
 day could refer to the apocalypse or 

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:21.750
 a fatal accident I do not know the truth 

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:23.670
 well the next video will be genesis 1 

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:26.340
 so I'll see if tomorrow is ready 

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:27.960
 to upload it hehe goodbye and until the 

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:31.080
 next 

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:33.810
 guys we ordered an empty pizza makes 

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:36.539
 a lot that we did not order a pizza 

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:39.000
 barbecue movies where it 's so pricked and 

00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:42.060

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.900
 gone to pick up improvements and more pizza for

00:07:47.229 --> 00:07:50.970
