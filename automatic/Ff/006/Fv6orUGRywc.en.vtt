00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
to get rid of it and I'm not one to be

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.150 
to get rid of it and I'm not one to be
abashed<00:01:48.020> about<00:01:48.410> believing<00:01:48.860> something

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160 
abashed about believing something

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.980 
abashed about believing something
differently<00:01:49.820> from<00:01:50.060> how<00:01:50.360> other<00:01:50.600> people

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
differently from how other people

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.370 
differently from how other people
believe<00:01:51.320> it<00:01:51.500> so<00:01:51.710> I<00:01:51.920> would<00:01:52.610> readily<00:01:53.170> cast<00:01:54.170> that

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
believe it so I would readily cast that

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.610 
believe it so I would readily cast that
doctrine<00:01:54.860> aside<00:01:55.160> but<00:01:55.460> after<00:01:55.760> a<00:01:55.790> year<00:01:55.850> of

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:56.620 
doctrine aside but after a year of

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.830 
doctrine aside but after a year of
examining<00:01:57.620> the<00:01:57.770> scriptures<00:01:58.250> and<00:01:58.840> opening

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
examining the scriptures and opening

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.990 
examining the scriptures and opening
myself<00:02:00.020> up<00:02:00.410> to<00:02:00.590> what<00:02:00.740> anyone<00:02:01.160> else<00:02:01.400> had<00:02:01.670> to<00:02:01.790> say

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
myself up to what anyone else had to say

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.750 
myself up to what anyone else had to say
I<00:02:02.620> concluded<00:02:03.620> that<00:02:03.770> if<00:02:03.950> I'm<00:02:04.100> going<00:02:04.340> to<00:02:04.520> believe

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
I concluded that if I'm going to believe

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.390 
I concluded that if I'm going to believe
the<00:02:05.030> Lord<00:02:05.240> Jesus<00:02:05.510> Christ<00:02:05.930> I'm<00:02:06.530> gonna<00:02:07.070> have<00:02:07.280> to

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
the Lord Jesus Christ I'm gonna have to

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.430 
the Lord Jesus Christ I'm gonna have to
believe<00:02:07.520> in<00:02:07.790> Hell<00:02:08.060> just<00:02:08.569> like<00:02:08.780> I<00:02:08.929> do<00:02:08.989> heaven

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
believe in Hell just like I do heaven

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.050 
believe in Hell just like I do heaven
because<00:02:09.739> he<00:02:09.890> spoke<00:02:10.129> twice<00:02:10.369> as<00:02:10.670> much<00:02:10.819> about

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
because he spoke twice as much about
