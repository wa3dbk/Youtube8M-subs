00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 Hi everyone, I'm taking part in the 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.569
 ramarim project inspires and in this series of 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.580
 videos I'll give tips to facilitate the 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.580
 your day to day when it's time to dress 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.210
 so this first video I'm going to give 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.850
 looks tips wearing boots 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.770
 over-the-knee those famous bosses above 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.480
 knee that have everything in this 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.189
 winter searching on this boot to 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.630
 people encounter a lot of restrictions 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.039
 about using it, right? 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.019
 usually we end up reading that only 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.619
 can use this model on the rise and who is 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.240
 thin 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.219
 Why are we people leaving this? 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.690
 prejudice aside since everyone 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.760
 you can use this video to run some 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.590
 tips to enhance your 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.210
 look to make it even more beautiful then 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.860
 This video will have two companions if 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.960
 is one of them 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.690
 this boot order black with the 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.600
 golden details and the other is the 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.030
 green marruÃ¡s two are from the collection of 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.190
 ramarim winter 2015 are super 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.660
 comfortable and super beautiful they are 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.300
 mainly because it has the leg 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.280
 thicker because it only gives the 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.050
 any kind of leg looks at someone 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.609
 squeezes a little thicker really 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.189
 have a little more difficulty of 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.170
 Find these boots will see dn is not 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.860
 so these boots are perfect for 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.510
 you 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.110
 But then, come on, let's go. 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.110
 z give the 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.640
 then these tips will serve to lengthen the 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.020
 silhouette which is what most of the 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.020
 women want is not really 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.170
 so the first tip to lengthen the 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.670
 silhouette is the monochrome look that 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.009
 all one of a kind 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.680
 so I posted on the whole black look with 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.170
 black blouse black pants and black boot 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.729
 so it gives you the impression that you are taller 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.729
 and also leaner 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.960
 The second tip you bet on is that all 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.700
 of one color with the boot of another color 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:18.430
 so in this look I bet on the boot 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.430
 brown with sweater and black skirt 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.180
 the short skirt and sun had also a tip 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.099
 nice that gives the impression of stretching 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.319
 so if you're short if you want 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.569
 look taller bet on more skirts 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.470
 short but careful not to seem 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.269
 vulgar 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.269
 bet makes it more loose 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.989
 and the third tip to lengthen the 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.900
 silhouette is to bet on the bottom of the 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:07.239
 same color and the top of a color 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.209
 different then bet on the leaves in the boot 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:12.280
 black and gray upper part one color 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:15.160
 different then here is the tip too 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.870
 the short skirt that also gives 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.910
 stretch printing reminding you that 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.410
 these looks with short pieces you 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.410
 You can bet on my cause. 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.750
 So these tips are super cool to 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.390
 who wants to appear taller and also 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.430
 It's okay for those who want to look leaner 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.400
 are three small tips but they give 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.020
 super right 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.780

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.760
