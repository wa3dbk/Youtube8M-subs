a<00:04:45.229> lot<00:04:45.620> of<00:04:45.740> wheelspin<00:04:46.120> now<00:04:47.120> it<00:04:47.270> looks<00:04:47.449> like

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
a lot of wheelspin now it looks like

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.080 
a lot of wheelspin now it looks like
we're<00:04:47.690> gonna<00:04:47.780> have<00:04:47.930> to<00:04:48.080> winch<00:04:48.229> so<00:04:49.220> finally<00:04:49.910> out
