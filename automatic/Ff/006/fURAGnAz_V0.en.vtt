and then the 4x4 is on the inside
actually<00:01:33.950> came<00:01:34.219> from<00:01:34.249> the<00:01:35.319> wood<00:01:36.319> that<00:01:36.560> we<00:01:36.649> had

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:36.859 
actually came from the wood that we had

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:39.209 
actually came from the wood that we had
from<00:01:37.069> a<00:01:37.249> storage<00:01:37.999> building<00:01:38.299> that<00:01:38.630> had<00:01:38.810> been

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:39.219 
from a storage building that had been

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:41.889 
from a storage building that had been
torn<00:01:40.219> down<00:01:40.399> because<00:01:40.880> of<00:01:41.029> the<00:01:41.119> wind<00:01:41.329> over<00:01:41.719> the

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
torn down because of the wind over the

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:43.959 
torn down because of the wind over the
winter<00:01:42.259> so<00:01:43.039> it<00:01:43.189> was<00:01:43.310> basically<00:01:43.490> scrap

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:43.969 
winter so it was basically scrap

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:45.730 
winter so it was basically scrap
material<00:01:44.539> so<00:01:44.719> I<00:01:44.749> was<00:01:44.929> able<00:01:45.109> to<00:01:45.139> cut<00:01:45.319> those<00:01:45.499> to

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
material so I was able to cut those to

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.239 
material so I was able to cut those to
fit<00:01:45.979> and<00:01:47.049> anchor<00:01:48.049> those<00:01:48.229> two<00:01:48.499> T<00:01:48.649> posts<00:01:48.979> as<00:01:49.069> well

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:49.249 
fit and anchor those two T posts as well

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:51.029 
fit and anchor those two T posts as well
so<00:01:49.579> when<00:01:49.759> we<00:01:49.819> go<00:01:49.939> inside<00:01:50.090> I'll<00:01:50.509> show<00:01:50.539> you<00:01:50.749> that

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039 
so when we go inside I'll show you that

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:55.149 
so when we go inside I'll show you that
but<00:01:52.039> what<00:01:52.159> I've<00:01:52.279> done<00:01:52.459> is<00:01:52.520> I've<00:01:52.849> taken<00:01:52.899> the<00:01:54.159> two

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
but what I've done is I've taken the two

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.790 
eight total two befores ten foot two
before<00:04:03.450> that<00:04:03.630> I<00:04:03.690> had<00:04:03.810> to<00:04:03.900> buy<00:04:04.050> so<00:04:04.470> we're

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
before that I had to buy so we're

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.680 
before that I had to buy so we're
looking<00:04:05.010> at<00:04:05.070> about<00:04:05.340> thirty<00:04:05.790> two<00:04:06.060> dollars<00:04:06.239> I

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
looking at about thirty two dollars I

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.930 
looking at about thirty two dollars I
think<00:04:06.720> it's<00:04:07.230> what<00:04:07.380> the<00:04:07.470> price<00:04:07.709> was<00:04:07.920> at<00:04:08.610> Lowe's

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
think it's what the price was at Lowe's

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.600 
think it's what the price was at Lowe's
for<00:04:09.239> those<00:04:09.390> two<00:04:09.540> by<00:04:09.660> fours<00:04:10.280> so<00:04:11.280> now<00:04:11.400> I'm<00:04:11.489> going

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
for those two by fours so now I'm going

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.160 
for those two by fours so now I'm going
to<00:04:11.670> go<00:04:11.820> ahead<00:04:11.910> and<00:04:12.060> step<00:04:12.209> back<00:04:12.390> outside<00:04:12.630> and

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
to go ahead and step back outside and

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.380 
to go ahead and step back outside and
talk<00:04:13.350> about<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:13.709> roof

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.910 

alright<00:04:18.390> the<00:04:18.510> roofing<00:04:18.780> material<00:04:18.870> we've<00:04:19.650> got

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:19.920 
alright the roofing material we've got

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.030 
alright the roofing material we've got
here<00:04:20.400> I<00:04:20.580> purchased<00:04:21.540> at<00:04:21.690> Lowe's<00:04:21.930> it's<00:04:22.740> called

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
here I purchased at Lowe's it's called

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.220 
here I purchased at Lowe's it's called
on<00:04:23.340> dura<00:04:25.040> after<00:04:26.040> having<00:04:26.520> purchased<00:04:26.790> this

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
on dura after having purchased this

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.500 
on dura after having purchased this
having<00:04:28.230> a<00:04:28.380> put<00:04:28.860> it<00:04:28.980> up<00:04:29.100> here<00:04:29.400> it's<00:04:30.090> doing<00:04:30.420> a

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
having a put it up here it's doing a

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.360 
having a put it up here it's doing a
really<00:04:30.810> really<00:04:30.870> good<00:04:31.320> job<00:04:31.560> at<00:04:31.920> keeping<00:04:32.070> the

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
really really good job at keeping the

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.740 
really really good job at keeping the
go-to<00:04:32.550> dry<00:04:32.850> you<00:04:32.910> might<00:04:33.150> have<00:04:33.270> any<00:04:33.420> issues

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
go-to dry you might have any issues

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
go-to dry you might have any issues
there<00:04:33.960> I<00:04:34.290> think<00:04:34.770> it's<00:04:34.920> pretty<00:04:35.190> durable<00:04:36.470> so<00:04:37.470> far

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
there I think it's pretty durable so far

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.010 
there I think it's pretty durable so far
I<00:04:38.070> mean<00:04:38.310> we've<00:04:38.430> only<00:04:38.490> had<00:04:38.760> this<00:04:38.910> up<00:04:39.120> here<00:04:39.480> just

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
I mean we've only had this up here just

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.400 
I mean we've only had this up here just
a<00:04:40.200> few<00:04:40.230> months<00:04:41.270> but<00:04:42.270> I<00:04:42.330> probably<00:04:42.720> would<00:04:43.200> go

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
a few months but I probably would go

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.550 
a few months but I probably would go
ahead<00:04:43.530> and<00:04:43.650> do<00:04:43.950> 10<00:04:44.370> the<00:04:44.850> next<00:04:45.150> time<00:04:45.360> this<00:04:46.230> stuff

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
ahead and do 10 the next time this stuff

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.720 
ahead and do 10 the next time this stuff
the<00:04:46.710> reason<00:04:46.920> I<00:04:46.980> went<00:04:47.100> with<00:04:47.220> this<00:04:47.370> stuff<00:04:47.580> is<00:04:47.700> I

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:47.730 
the reason I went with this stuff is I

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.310 
the reason I went with this stuff is I
looked<00:04:47.910> at<00:04:48.000> the<00:04:48.090> 10<00:04:48.300> we<00:04:48.780> were<00:04:48.900> looking<00:04:49.170> at

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
looked at the 10 we were looking at

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.570 
looked at the 10 we were looking at
about<00:04:49.820> $35<00:04:50.820> a<00:04:50.850> sheet<00:04:51.210> for<00:04:51.450> the<00:04:51.540> 10<00:04:51.780> and<00:04:52.580> this

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
about $35 a sheet for the 10 and this

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.330 
about $35 a sheet for the 10 and this
stuff<00:04:53.790> was<00:04:54.000> $20<00:04:54.540> a<00:04:54.570> sheet<00:04:54.870> it<00:04:55.650> took<00:04:55.830> six<00:04:56.100> sheets

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
stuff was $20 a sheet it took six sheets

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.460 
stuff was $20 a sheet it took six sheets
to<00:04:56.550> cover<00:04:56.790> this<00:04:57.540> a<00:04:57.600> 10<00:04:58.410> by<00:04:58.560> 10<00:04:58.590> area<00:04:59.930> and<00:05:00.930> so

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
to cover this a 10 by 10 area and so

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:02.960 
to cover this a 10 by 10 area and so
that's<00:05:01.920> the<00:05:02.040> main<00:05:02.190> reason<00:05:02.400> what's<00:05:02.730> the<00:05:02.790> cost

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
that's the main reason what's the cost

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:03.620 
that's the main reason what's the cost
difference

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
difference

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.200 
difference
the<00:05:04.530> main<00:05:04.770> thing<00:05:05.190> let's<00:05:05.700> see<00:05:05.790> if<00:05:05.850> I<00:05:05.910> can<00:05:06.030> find

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
the main thing let's see if I can find

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.990 
the main thing let's see if I can find
an<00:05:06.390> area<00:05:06.660> where<00:05:07.100> I<00:05:09.770> did<00:05:10.770> this<00:05:10.980> I<00:05:11.250> was<00:05:11.760> putting

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
an area where I did this I was putting

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.140 
an area where I did this I was putting
it<00:05:12.120> on<00:05:12.650> hammering<00:05:13.650> on<00:05:13.860> the<00:05:14.070> roof<00:05:14.250> nails<00:05:14.610> to

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
it on hammering on the roof nails to

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.390 
it on hammering on the roof nails to
attach<00:05:15.450> it<00:05:15.630> to<00:05:15.750> the<00:05:15.870> two<00:05:15.990> befores<00:05:16.350> below<00:05:16.740> it

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
attach it to the two befores below it

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.610 
attach it to the two befores below it
was<00:05:17.550> really<00:05:18.030> easy<00:05:18.300> to<00:05:18.510> hammer<00:05:18.960> through<00:05:19.380> and

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
was really easy to hammer through and

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.830 
was really easy to hammer through and
create<00:05:20.250> holes<00:05:20.490> and<00:05:20.760> that<00:05:20.880> did<00:05:21.060> this<00:05:21.270> in<00:05:21.510> about

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
create holes and that did this in about

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.950 
create holes and that did this in about
five<00:05:22.320> or<00:05:22.350> six<00:05:22.620> different<00:05:22.860> places<00:05:23.810> other<00:05:24.810> than

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
five or six different places other than

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.840 
five or six different places other than
that<00:05:25.230> it<00:05:25.410> was<00:05:25.500> very<00:05:25.710> easy<00:05:26.070> to<00:05:26.220> put<00:05:26.460> up<00:05:26.490> it's

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:26.850 
that it was very easy to put up it's

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.020 
that it was very easy to put up it's
very<00:05:27.120> lightweight<00:05:27.450> material<00:05:28.820> but<00:05:29.820> mainly

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
very lightweight material but mainly

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.210 
very lightweight material but mainly
because<00:05:30.450> I<00:05:30.690> did<00:05:31.020> do<00:05:31.230> that<00:05:31.470> in<00:05:31.710> about<00:05:31.800> five<00:05:32.100> or

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
because I did do that in about five or

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.740 
because I did do that in about five or
six<00:05:32.310> places<00:05:32.550> I<00:05:33.000> felt<00:05:33.210> like<00:05:33.360> I<00:05:33.450> wouldn't<00:05:33.690> have

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
six places I felt like I wouldn't have

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.830 
six places I felt like I wouldn't have
done<00:05:33.930> that<00:05:34.110> if<00:05:34.260> I<00:05:34.350> had<00:05:34.530> actually<00:05:34.830> used<00:05:34.860> ten<00:05:35.340> and

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
done that if I had actually used ten and

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.410 
done that if I had actually used ten and
that's<00:05:36.840> just<00:05:37.350> it's<00:05:37.860> just<00:05:37.920> unfortunate<00:05:38.700> so<00:05:38.880> if

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:39.420 
that's just it's just unfortunate so if

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.960 
that's just it's just unfortunate so if
I<00:05:39.630> may<00:05:39.810> end<00:05:39.960> up<00:05:40.080> make<00:05:40.230> another<00:05:40.530> one<00:05:40.740> of<00:05:40.860> these<00:05:40.970> I

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
I may end up make another one of these I

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.290 
I may end up make another one of these I
will<00:05:42.660> probably<00:05:42.780> learn<00:05:43.080> the<00:05:43.290> lesson<00:05:43.740> and<00:05:44.300> not

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
will probably learn the lesson and not

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.880 
will probably learn the lesson and not
do<00:05:45.600> that<00:05:45.810> probably<00:05:46.260> just<00:05:46.380> go<00:05:46.470> ahead<00:05:46.620> and<00:05:46.710> use

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:46.890 
do that probably just go ahead and use

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.250 
do that probably just go ahead and use
the<00:05:47.310> ten<00:05:47.970> even<00:05:48.300> if<00:05:48.390> I<00:05:48.450> have<00:05:48.570> to<00:05:48.660> buy<00:05:48.810> it<00:05:48.840> new<00:05:49.050> and

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
the ten even if I have to buy it new and

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.530 
the ten even if I have to buy it new and
pay<00:05:49.350> the<00:05:49.470> higher<00:05:49.650> price<00:05:50.240> seems<00:05:51.240> like<00:05:51.330> a<00:05:51.360> better

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:51.540 
pay the higher price seems like a better

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.500 
pay the higher price seems like a better
thing<00:05:51.840> to<00:05:51.870> do<00:05:52.170> I<00:05:52.790> probably<00:05:53.790> will<00:05:54.060> make<00:05:54.270> another

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
thing to do I probably will make another

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.230 
thing to do I probably will make another
one<00:05:54.600> of<00:05:54.750> these<00:05:54.870> shelters<00:05:55.670> not<00:05:56.670> necessarily

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
one of these shelters not necessarily
