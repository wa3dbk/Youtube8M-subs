 was had not one but two of them already 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:19.600
 today the document can not beat the time 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:23.080
 we entered off down to vote 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.619
 or not the delay in this path which should 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.619
 water 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:32.950
 heroes to the police post that the exchange 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.900
 manual travel hard and it is this chaos that 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.610
 neymar 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.610
 the wine manages to make 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:50.730
 but as you say to me in this case it is better 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.890
 Nor is it tired, it 's not the animal I 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:01:03.839
 I know you know kakÃ¡ warrior almost 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:08.990
 a march and felt it does not shirk that it is 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:08.990
 manual gearbox and rear wheel drive 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:25.140
 now now that with a com 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.990
 Look, I gotta say, they never did. 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:34.500
 A trip so hard on my happy life. 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:36.360
 march exchanging hurry but it is a car 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.190
 there is risk I still have not had the courage to punish 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.690
 attraction zinha comes here my doubt is 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.740
 the following opted that this manual gearbox 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.330
 and will the 911 gt2 want 911 top in 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.369
 terms of performance can compete 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:52.649
 against it automates to be seen when 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.629
 times of formula 1 when people 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.849
 I was moving the automatic gearbox 

00:01:54.629 --> 00:02:00.000
 I still had to get my foot up 

00:01:56.849 --> 00:02:02.489
 changing gears lost two tenths 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.709
 thence with the foot underneath giving a chance 

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:07.619
 You have a very great advantage there. 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:09.450
 the ranking of fun of here as the 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.120
 We've talked a few times I think 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.440
 It will be higher than the gt but time 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.269
 going to have to work 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.269

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:58.290
 this is I got him to bring or wanted 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.570
 straight for the first time the country goes cano 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.030
 unite in the acceleration that happened in the 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:06.180
 It's not the day, I was not going to give it a shot. 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:10.410
 fast car pankadinha car so if 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.420
 this occurs without traction control without 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.550
 Nothing the time I freed you. 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.040
 he wanted to get out through the front looks I 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:22.940
 let pot there still someone in January 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.940
 Not here, they do not attract hard to talk. 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.660

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.990
 Look, is this the latest 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:20.000
 I'm sorry , the cleaning crew is not even there. 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.000
 speak 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.100
 it was very little for the godzilla to want 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.840
 do justice to the nickname 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:34.470
 even so he managed to become a 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.610
 temp in gt-r sandwiches between 2 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.770
 portions 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.230
 Look, it was the most beautiful thing to see from outside. 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:43.620
 but on the stopwatch zeroed 50 and 90 or 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:46.050
 a little bit behind even the two gps did not 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.240
 we have a turn and the explanation for this is 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:51.380
 that you take away all the receiving is 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:54.570
 breathing tried to kiss need 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:58.260
 breathing is you take all control 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:05:01.320
 he is very foolhardy and outlandish 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:03.840
 you're basically on your side looking for 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.180
 the march then we have there from three to 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.760
 four tenths only in this one played 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.830
 maybe even more in a circus then had a 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.320
 work like the one that the exchange is very 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:16.080
 long for the track because this must 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:18.990
 give your 300 and 100 per hour then the 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:22.410
 what happened happened to me here changing 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:25.410
 still for fourth we a second march 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:27.060
 lina 364 is very mine and he is there 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.950
 looking out the front door he is 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.540
 asking for a first but change to the 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:36.570
 first after the second loses 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:38.490
 a lot of time so it's kind of a day 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:40.860
 wonderful that we had here, right? 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.560
 two goals from godzilla killer 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:45.480
 I hope you continue very much 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:49.350
 accelerated because I'm going to continue 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:52.160
 take my way to help those points 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.160
 prepared was good
