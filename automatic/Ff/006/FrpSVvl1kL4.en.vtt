00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
much her I'm gonna turn it into a turn

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.880 
much her I'm gonna turn it into a turn
it<00:02:38.230> into<00:02:38.459> horizon<00:02:39.459> hobby<00:02:39.610> to<00:02:39.940> fix<00:02:40.180> it<00:02:40.420> and<00:02:40.890> the

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
it into horizon hobby to fix it and the

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.979 
it into horizon hobby to fix it and the
light<00:02:42.069> bulb<00:02:42.570> so<00:02:43.570> once<00:02:43.959> i<00:02:44.080> get<00:02:44.230> that<00:02:44.380> back<00:02:44.640> or

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
light bulb so once i get that back or

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.780 
light bulb so once i get that back or
what<00:02:46.989> once<00:02:47.230> i<00:02:47.350> call<00:02:47.560> them<00:02:47.739> yeah<00:02:47.950> once<00:02:48.519> i<00:02:48.610> call

what once i call them yeah once i call
them<00:02:48.940> i'm<00:02:49.720> going<00:02:49.959> to<00:02:50.459> try<00:02:51.459> to<00:02:51.519> get<00:02:51.730> running<00:02:52.030> on

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
them i'm going to try to get running on

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.310 
them i'm going to try to get running on
this<00:02:52.450> track<00:02:53.580> and<00:02:54.580> i<00:02:55.360> use<00:02:55.540> sand<00:02:55.840> paddles<00:02:56.170> on

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
this track and i use sand paddles on

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.449 
this track and i use sand paddles on
this<00:02:56.530> it's<00:02:56.890> fine<00:02:57.190> and<00:02:58.769> you<00:02:59.769> want<00:02:59.950> to<00:03:00.040> run<00:03:00.190> like

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
this it's fine and you want to run like

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.890 
this it's fine and you want to run like
regular<00:03:01.120> and<00:03:02.280> regular<00:03:03.280> tires<00:03:03.850> just<00:03:04.239> need<00:03:04.840> to

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
regular and regular tires just need to

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.259 
regular and regular tires just need to
wet<00:03:05.470> it<00:03:05.500> a<00:03:05.620> little<00:03:05.860> bit<00:03:06.040> or<00:03:06.220> just<00:03:06.250> like<00:03:06.700> take

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
wet it a little bit or just like take

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.650 
wet it a little bit or just like take
more<00:03:07.900> dirt<00:03:08.080> out<00:03:08.290> so<00:03:08.970> you<00:03:09.970> can<00:03:10.150> drive<00:03:10.450> better

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
more dirt out so you can drive better

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.860 
more dirt out so you can drive better
because<00:03:10.959> it's<00:03:11.110> pretty<00:03:11.530> slippery<00:03:11.890> and<00:03:12.870> size

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
because it's pretty slippery and size

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:21.420 
because it's pretty slippery and size
comparison<00:03:14.560> to<00:03:15.239> microti<00:03:19.799> yep<00:03:20.799> because<00:03:21.160> he<00:03:21.310> has

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
comparison to microti yep because he has

claimed<00:03:36.280> that<00:03:36.430> part<00:03:36.700> out<00:03:37.200> you<00:03:38.200> know<00:03:38.260> it's

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
claimed that part out you know it's

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.720 
claimed that part out you know it's
pretty<00:03:38.799> wide<00:03:39.299> and<00:03:40.299> that's<00:03:40.690> just<00:03:40.930> a<00:03:41.310> 136<00:03:42.310> scale

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
pretty wide and that's just a 136 scale

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:51.930 
pretty wide and that's just a 136 scale
and<00:03:43.950> now<00:03:44.950> for<00:03:45.250> the<00:03:47.730> 01<00:03:48.730> 16<00:03:49.239> scale<00:03:50.700> you<00:03:51.700> see<00:03:51.880> you

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
and now for the 01 16 scale you see you

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.630 
and now for the 01 16 scale you see you
still<00:03:52.120> have<00:03:52.239> space<00:03:52.510> to<00:03:53.670> all<00:03:54.670> lanes<00:03:55.630> you<00:03:56.110> see

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
still have space to all lanes you see

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.699 
still have space to all lanes you see
over<00:03:57.640> here<00:03:57.670> at<00:03:58.030> a<00:03:58.060> turn<00:03:59.340> you<00:04:00.340> see<00:04:01.170> still<00:04:02.170> still

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
over here at a turn you see still still

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.819 
over here at a turn you see still still
a<00:04:02.739> lot<00:04:03.010> of<00:04:03.040> space<00:04:03.370> but<00:04:04.290> i'm<00:04:05.290> not<00:04:05.350> going<00:04:05.500> to<00:04:05.650> keep

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:05.829 
a lot of space but i'm not going to keep

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:07.650 
a lot of space but i'm not going to keep
these<00:04:06.040> dirt<00:04:06.280> mountains<00:04:06.700> up<00:04:06.910> i'm<00:04:07.450> going<00:04:07.600> to

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
these dirt mountains up i'm going to

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.440 
these dirt mountains up i'm going to
replace<00:04:08.049> it<00:04:08.290> what's<00:04:08.590> almost<00:04:09.000> as<00:04:10.000> you<00:04:10.180> can<00:04:10.299> see

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
replace it what's almost as you can see

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.210 
replace it what's almost as you can see
it<00:04:10.600> goes<00:04:10.720> all<00:04:10.959> around<00:04:10.989> the<00:04:11.620> turns<00:04:11.890> low<00:04:12.160> too

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
it goes all around the turns low too

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.490 
it goes all around the turns low too
small<00:04:12.700> so<00:04:12.940> it's<00:04:13.570> going<00:04:13.690> to<00:04:13.750> be<00:04:13.870> a<00:04:13.900> little<00:04:14.109> fixed

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
small so it's going to be a little fixed

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.420 
small so it's going to be a little fixed
with<00:04:15.130> like<00:04:15.510> another<00:04:16.510> type<00:04:17.049> of<00:04:17.079> doing<00:04:17.829> it<00:04:17.979> so<00:04:18.160> I

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
with like another type of doing it so I

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.779 
with like another type of doing it so I
just<00:04:18.789> put<00:04:19.030> this<00:04:19.299> tongue<00:04:19.539> layout<00:04:20.500> to<00:04:21.190> check<00:04:21.700> it

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:21.789 
just put this tongue layout to check it

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:22.749 
just put this tongue layout to check it
out<00:04:21.880> and

00:04:22.749 --> 00:04:22.759 
out and

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:25.580 
out and
sighs<00:04:23.759> to<00:04:24.030> it<00:04:24.150> size<00:04:24.449> comparison<00:04:25.080> it's<00:04:25.380> pretty

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
sighs to it size comparison it's pretty

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:31.570 
sighs to it size comparison it's pretty
bigger<00:04:25.910> and<00:04:28.069> you<00:04:29.539> she<00:04:30.539> raced<00:04:30.780> ball<00:04:31.020> for<00:04:31.199> these

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
bigger and you she raced ball for these

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.219 
bigger and you she raced ball for these
little<00:04:32.580> size<00:04:32.729> comparison<00:04:32.870> you<00:04:33.870> can<00:04:33.900> probably

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
little size comparison you can probably

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:39.499 
little size comparison you can probably
run<00:04:35.389> maybe<00:04:36.389> one-tenth<00:04:37.319> scale<00:04:37.410> in<00:04:37.740> here<00:04:38.509> would

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:39.509 
run maybe one-tenth scale in here would

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:43.040 
run maybe one-tenth scale in here would
be<00:04:39.539> fun<00:04:39.930> once<00:04:40.560> i<00:04:40.710> get<00:04:40.860> a<00:04:40.889> 1-10<00:04:41.250> scale<00:04:41.900> run<00:04:42.900> it

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
be fun once i get a 1-10 scale run it

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.800 
be fun once i get a 1-10 scale run it
around<00:04:43.169> and<00:04:43.759> this<00:04:44.759> is<00:04:44.940> pretty<00:04:45.180> much<00:04:45.270> my<00:04:45.389> track

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
around and this is pretty much my track

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.029 
around and this is pretty much my track
and<00:04:47.720> down<00:04:48.720> there<00:04:49.050> it's<00:04:49.229> a<00:04:49.319> little<00:04:49.560> math<00:04:49.770> right

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
and down there it's a little math right

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:53.990 
and down there it's a little math right
there<00:04:51.289> it's<00:04:52.289> going<00:04:52.410> to<00:04:52.440> be<00:04:52.560> like<00:04:52.680> maybe<00:04:53.130> a<00:04:53.280> on

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
there it's going to be like maybe a on

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.770 
there it's going to be like maybe a on
road<00:04:54.419> track<00:04:55.490> maybe<00:04:56.490> but<00:04:56.940> it<00:04:57.030> has<00:04:57.120> little<00:04:57.449> bumps

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
road track maybe but it has little bumps

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.659 
road track maybe but it has little bumps
because<00:04:57.930> I<00:04:58.050> like<00:04:58.710> the<00:04:58.740> color<00:04:59.160> of<00:04:59.280> the<00:04:59.430> rocks

00:04:59.659 --> 00:04:59.669 
because I like the color of the rocks

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:01.640 
because I like the color of the rocks
and<00:04:59.849> stuff<00:05:00.030> I'll<00:05:00.270> put<00:05:00.840> another<00:05:01.080> video<00:05:01.380> of<00:05:01.530> that

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
and stuff I'll put another video of that

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.500 
and stuff I'll put another video of that
and<00:05:02.340> yeah<00:05:03.120> this<00:05:03.750> is<00:05:03.900> pretty<00:05:03.960> much<00:05:04.110> my<00:05:04.229> check
