for like a 15 I'm not sure if I'm gonna

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:28.450 
for like a 15 I'm not sure if I'm gonna
do

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
do

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.719 
do
maybe<00:01:28.880> 15<00:01:29.420> for<00:01:29.659> 15<00:01:29.930> hatch<00:01:30.320> or<00:01:30.799> I<00:01:30.979> could<00:01:31.400> just<00:01:31.430> go

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
maybe 15 for 15 hatch or I could just go

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.890 
maybe 15 for 15 hatch or I could just go
now<00:01:32.090> I'll<00:01:32.570> just<00:01:32.600> do<00:01:32.930> a<00:01:32.960> fortune<00:01:33.430> actually

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
right now because you never know what

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.550 
right now because you never know what
you<00:02:08.149> could<00:02:08.269> be<00:02:08.390> doing<00:02:08.420> be<00:02:08.869> putting<00:02:09.350> can

you could be doing be putting can
understand<00:02:09.950> where<00:02:10.220> all<00:02:10.280> I<00:02:10.459> know<00:02:10.670> but<00:02:11.120> it<00:02:11.209> looks

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
understand where all I know but it looks

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:12.280 
understand where all I know but it looks
like<00:02:11.420> he's<00:02:11.600> not<00:02:11.720> going<00:02:11.870> to<00:02:11.900> be<00:02:11.989> doing<00:02:12.080> that

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
like he's not going to be doing that

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.750 
like he's not going to be doing that
because<00:02:12.440> he<00:02:12.650> is<00:02:12.769> running<00:02:12.950> back<00:02:13.190> to<00:02:13.370> his<00:02:13.550> face

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
because he is running back to his face

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.699 
because he is running back to his face
and<00:02:14.060> if<00:02:14.570> he<00:02:14.720> leaves<00:02:14.900> me<00:02:15.019> back<00:02:15.320> there<00:02:15.560> that

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
and if he leaves me back there that

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.550 
and if he leaves me back there that
would<00:02:15.890> be<00:02:16.040> awesome<00:02:16.540> that<00:02:17.540> booty<00:02:17.900> was<00:02:17.930> giving

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560

just got hit cybernetics so that's
really<00:03:06.730> interesting<00:03:07.000> um<00:03:07.569> I<00:03:08.019> thought<00:03:08.200> that's

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:08.469 
really interesting um I thought that's

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
now let's see i'll build a couple queens

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:20.970 
now let's see i'll build a couple queens
and<00:03:17.879> girls<00:03:18.879> I'm<00:03:19.329> video<00:03:19.900> from<00:03:20.139> drones<00:03:20.500> and<00:03:20.769> then

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
and girls I'm video from drones and then

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.339 
and girls I'm video from drones and then
all<00:03:21.280> filthy<00:03:21.790> force<00:03:22.090> it<00:03:22.269> looks<00:03:22.480> like<00:03:22.689> though<00:03:23.049> he

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
all filthy force it looks like though he

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:25.110 
all filthy force it looks like though he
just<00:03:23.709> has<00:03:23.889> he's<00:03:24.340> definitely<00:03:24.879> grown<00:03:25.090> a

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
just has he's definitely grown a

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.179 
just has he's definitely grown a
boosting<00:03:25.540> than<00:03:25.719> that<00:03:25.930> I<00:03:26.170> think<00:03:26.739> you<00:03:27.010> might<00:03:27.069> be

00:03:27.179 --> 00:03:27.189 
boosting than that I think you might be

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:32.309 
boosting than that I think you might be
even<00:03:27.400> currently<00:03:28.030> staying<00:03:30.120> warp<00:03:31.120> gate<00:03:31.329> so<00:03:31.750> what

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
even currently staying warp gate so what

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.460 
even currently staying warp gate so what
I'm<00:03:32.409> going<00:03:32.500> to<00:03:32.590> do<00:03:32.739> right<00:03:32.769> now<00:03:32.980> is<00:03:33.989> I<00:03:34.989> want<00:03:35.169> to

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
I'm going to do right now is I want to

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.199 
I'm going to do right now is I want to

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
get metabolic boost actually that's a

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.509 
get metabolic boost actually that's a
really<00:03:37.239> good<00:03:37.569> one<00:03:37.750> action<00:03:38.139> for<00:03:38.409> now<00:03:39.189> i'll<00:03:39.370> go

really good one action for now i'll go
for<00:03:39.669> metabolic<00:03:40.030> lose<00:03:40.269> i<00:03:40.419> really<00:03:40.629> feel<00:03:40.750> like

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
for metabolic lose i really feel like

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.399 
for metabolic lose i really feel like
playing<00:03:40.959> with<00:03:41.260> some<00:03:41.439> zerglings<00:03:43.260> just<00:03:44.260> gotta

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:44.409 
playing with some zerglings just gotta

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:46.110 
playing with some zerglings just gotta
wait<00:03:44.530> for<00:03:44.590> those<00:03:44.859> hundred<00:03:45.430> minerals<00:03:45.849> though

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
wait for those hundred minerals though

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
actually I could send a few zeros link

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:19.949 
actually I could send a few zeros link
for<00:04:18.729> to<00:04:18.940> go<00:04:19.060> ahead<00:04:19.180> and<00:04:19.449> kill<00:04:19.599> him<00:04:19.810> that

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
my drone that with your own one there we

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.080 
my drone that with your own one there we
go<00:04:28.990> okay<00:04:29.650> my<00:04:29.800> drum<00:04:30.009> could<00:04:30.219> go<00:04:30.310> home<00:04:30.550> safely

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
go okay my drum could go home safely

go okay my drum could go home safely
let's<00:04:31.990> put<00:04:32.259> a<00:04:32.289> zergling<00:04:32.650> on<00:04:32.919> his<00:04:33.129> face<00:04:33.460> and

00:04:34.369 --> 00:04:34.379 
let's put a zergling on his face and

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:36.719 
let's put a zergling on his face and
continue<00:04:35.379> to<00:04:35.409> actually<00:04:35.860> I<00:04:36.069> was<00:04:36.279> gonna<00:04:36.460> be

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
continue to actually I was gonna be

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:37.790 
continue to actually I was gonna be
building<00:04:36.909> as<00:04:37.120> flawed<00:04:37.360> as<00:04:37.389> Earthlings

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
building as flawed as Earthlings

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.140 
building as flawed as Earthlings
basically<00:04:38.800> I'm<00:04:38.889> gonna<00:04:39.039> brush<00:04:39.279> in<00:04:39.550> I<00:04:39.849> don't

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
basically I'm gonna brush in I don't

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.159 
basically I'm gonna brush in I don't
know<00:04:40.210> how<00:04:40.330> well<00:04:40.539> this<00:04:40.719> is<00:04:40.779> going<00:04:40.990> to<00:04:41.080> work

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
know how well this is going to work

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.409 
know how well this is going to work
actually<00:04:41.439> it<00:04:42.400> might<00:04:42.639> not<00:04:42.819> work<00:04:42.879> so<00:04:43.270> well

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
actually it might not work so well

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.330 
actually it might not work so well
because<00:04:43.629> of<00:04:43.840> course<00:04:44.080> he's<00:04:44.259> choked<00:04:44.860> it<00:04:45.039> in<00:04:45.189> his

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
because of course he's choked it in his

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.489 
because of course he's choked it in his
face<00:04:45.580> but<00:04:45.789> if<00:04:45.909> he<00:04:45.999> comes<00:04:46.210> on<00:04:46.449> him<00:04:46.689> to<00:04:47.229> try<00:04:47.439> to

00:04:47.489 --> 00:04:47.499 
face but if he comes on him to try to

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:50.249 
face but if he comes on him to try to
attack<00:04:47.830> me<00:04:48.009> I'm<00:04:48.879> gonna<00:04:48.999> have<00:04:49.150> a<00:04:49.259> little

what else will you don't be building

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:59.129 
what else will you don't be building
