00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
be here like this whole experience for

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.200 
be here like this whole experience for
me<00:00:52.050> has<00:00:52.199> just<00:00:52.309> enriched<00:00:53.309> my<00:00:53.520> life<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.940> so<00:00:53.969> many

ways<00:00:56.180> in<00:00:57.180> my<00:00:57.360> relationships<00:00:58.020> like<00:00:58.289> the

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
ways in my relationships like the

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.630 
ways in my relationships like the
relationships<00:00:59.100> i've<00:00:59.219> developed<00:00:59.430> here

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
relationships i've developed here

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.700

priceless<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.850> me<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:03.149> love<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.780> challenge<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.439> I

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
priceless to me I love a challenge and I

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.870 
priceless to me I love a challenge and I
think<00:01:04.920> that's<00:01:05.159> definitely<00:01:05.309> what<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.670> school

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
think that's definitely what the school

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.850 
think that's definitely what the school
brings<00:01:06.150> I<00:01:06.479> mean<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.750> really<00:01:06.960> enjoys<00:01:07.380> deep

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
brings I mean I really enjoys deep

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.530 
brings I mean I really enjoys deep
learning<00:01:08.010> curves<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.760> that's<00:01:09.180> definitely

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
learning curves and that's definitely

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.030 
learning curves and that's definitely
something<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:10.049> get<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.229> railroads<00:01:10.740> but

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
something that you get a railroads but

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.370 
something that you get a railroads but
with<00:01:11.549> steep<00:01:11.760> learning<00:01:11.909> curves<00:01:12.330> comes<00:01:12.840> huge

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
with steep learning curves comes huge

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.170 
with steep learning curves comes huge
amounts<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.740> momentum<00:01:14.250> for<00:01:14.610> personal<00:01:15.060> growth

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
amounts of momentum for personal growth

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.840 
amounts of momentum for personal growth
and<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:16.259> think<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.619> that's<00:01:16.650> really<00:01:17.460> why<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.610> lot

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
and I think that that's really why a lot

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.370 
and I think that that's really why a lot
of<00:01:17.909> us<00:01:18.119> are<00:01:18.240> here<00:01:18.420> certainly<00:01:18.689> what's<00:01:19.020> why<00:01:19.140> I'm

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
of us are here certainly what's why I'm

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.620 
of us are here certainly what's why I'm
here<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:20.220> be<00:01:20.310> able<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.549> push<00:01:20.790> myself<00:01:21.030> push

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
here to be able to push myself push

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.390 
here to be able to push myself push
beyond<00:01:21.869> my<00:01:22.049> borders<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.799> be<00:01:22.950> able<00:01:23.100> to

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
beyond my borders and to be able to

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.600 
beyond my borders and to be able to
engage<00:01:24.119> in<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.540> different<00:01:24.900> career<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.619> and

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
engage in a different career and and and

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.240 
engage in a different career and and and
grow<00:01:27.150> my<00:01:27.330> career's<00:01:27.689> is<00:01:28.020> massive<00:01:28.770> for<00:01:28.799> me<00:01:29.070> I

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
grow my career's is massive for me I

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.539 
grow my career's is massive for me I
think<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.060> courses<00:01:30.540> that<00:01:30.570> we've<00:01:31.549> worked

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
think that the courses that we've worked

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.789 
think that the courses that we've worked
through<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.869> certain<00:01:34.290> ways<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.680> we've

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
through and the certain ways that we've

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.940 
through and the certain ways that we've
done<00:01:34.979> so<00:01:35.340> have<00:01:35.909> allowed<00:01:36.299> us<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.930> become<00:01:37.680> more

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
done so have allowed us to become more

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.850 
done so have allowed us to become more
well-rounded<00:01:38.420> both<00:01:39.420> as<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.570> cohort<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.500> suppose

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
well-rounded both as a cohort I suppose

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.980 
well-rounded both as a cohort I suppose
and<00:01:41.040> then<00:01:41.130> as<00:01:41.250> individuals<00:01:41.880> we're<00:01:42.750> now<00:01:42.840> able

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
and then as individuals we're now able

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.020 
and then as individuals we're now able
to<00:01:43.170> think<00:01:43.470> about<00:01:43.590> problem<00:01:44.520> solving<00:01:44.549> in<00:01:44.970> a

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
to think about problem solving in a

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.219 
to think about problem solving in a
different<00:01:45.329> way<00:01:45.420> we're<00:01:45.600> able<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.899> think<00:01:46.110> about

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
different way we're able to think about

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.830 
different way we're able to think about
the<00:01:46.890> future<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.759> our<00:01:48.000> planet<00:01:48.180> in<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.810> different

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
the future of our planet in a different

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.649 
the future of our planet in a different
way<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.619> though<00:01:50.579> it's<00:01:50.759> been<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.420> know<00:01:51.540> what

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
way and though it's been you know what

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.139 
way and though it's been you know what
times<00:01:51.930> trying<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.070> really<00:01:53.640> kind<00:01:54.060> of

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
times trying and it really kind of

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.630 
times trying and it really kind of
pushes<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.570> outside<00:01:54.899> of<00:01:55.020> your<00:01:55.140> comfort<00:01:55.320> zone

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
pushes you outside of your comfort zone

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.010 
pushes you outside of your comfort zone
it's<00:01:56.640> been<00:01:56.880> one<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.180> best<00:01:57.329> experiences<00:01:57.509> of

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
it's been one of the best experiences of

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.620
