you<00:03:00.160> know<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.430> numbers<00:03:00.760> and<00:03:01.000> then<00:03:01.090> you<00:03:01.630> know

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
you know the numbers and then you know

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.540 
you know the numbers and then you know
shift<00:03:02.500> and<00:03:02.650> right-click<00:03:02.920> to<00:03:02.950> get<00:03:03.430> your

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
diamonds back but unfortunately you have

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.720 
diamonds back but unfortunately you have
to<00:03:04.990> get<00:03:05.140> them<00:03:05.260> individually<00:03:05.470> so<00:03:06.370> there<00:03:06.550> you<00:03:06.670> go

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
to get them individually so there you go

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.120 
to get them individually so there you go
and<00:03:07.210> that's<00:03:07.900> actually<00:03:08.050> taking<00:03:08.410> quite<00:03:08.740> a<00:03:08.800> while

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
and that's actually taking quite a while

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.620 
and that's actually taking quite a while
so<00:03:09.340> we'll<00:03:09.430> just<00:03:09.580> leave<00:03:09.670> that<00:03:09.730> in<00:03:09.970> there<00:03:10.120> so

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
so we'll just leave that in there so

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.360 
so we'll just leave that in there so
last<00:03:10.870> but<00:03:10.960> not<00:03:11.110> least<00:03:11.230> we<00:03:11.680> have<00:03:11.710> the<00:03:11.860> furnace

down my glass and increasing nice a
three-dimensional<00:03:51.910> look<00:03:52.030> to<00:03:52.210> it<00:03:52.330> I<00:03:52.420> could

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
three-dimensional look to it I could

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.180 
three-dimensional look to it I could
just<00:03:52.780> you<00:03:53.140> know<00:03:53.170> get<00:03:53.440> that<00:03:53.560> back<00:03:53.770> if<00:03:53.950> I<00:03:54.010> can

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
just you know get that back if I can
