that I would improve of this mod that's
not<00:04:22.720> too<00:04:22.870> bad<00:04:22.900> but<00:04:23.110> the<00:04:23.500> scopes<00:04:23.889> are<00:04:24.190> little

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520

not too bad but the scopes are little
low<00:04:24.669> quality<00:04:25.120> I'd<00:04:25.810> make<00:04:26.350> them<00:04:26.440> a<00:04:26.560> bit<00:04:26.710> sharper
