 well in this video I will mention you 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.030
 some data that probably 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:12.190
 they did not know about coffee 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.740
 and before going with the information 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.810
 I want to ask you a big apology for the 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.430
 voice with which will narrate this video how 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.430

 pastor in ethiopia discovered the effects 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.950
 of the coffee when he observed that his goats 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.550
 they were upset after eating the beans 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:39.160
 of coffee, however strange it may seem 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.110

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.980
