00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830 
are basically joystick or analog stick

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.940 
are basically joystick or analog stick
extensions<00:00:30.370> for<00:00:30.520> your<00:00:30.810> 360<00:00:31.810> that<00:00:32.200> uh<00:00:32.230> you<00:00:32.829> know

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:32.950 
extensions for your 360 that uh you know

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:33.900 
extensions for your 360 that uh you know

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590 
so you have a little more precision when

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.280 
so you have a little more precision when
aiming<00:00:36.630> compared<00:00:37.630> to<00:00:37.690> what<00:00:37.780> you<00:00:37.840> usually<00:00:37.960> do

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
see it's a lot easier to move to stick

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.109 
see it's a lot easier to move to stick
around<00:01:25.630> just<00:01:26.139> little<00:01:26.829> amounts<00:01:27.819> without

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
around just little amounts without

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.629 
around just little amounts without
pushing<00:01:28.840> it<00:01:29.079> too<00:01:29.229> far<00:01:29.259> you<00:01:30.249> know<00:01:30.340> you<00:01:30.429> can<00:01:30.549> see

00:01:30.629 --> 00:01:30.639 
pushing it too far you know you can see

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:32.190 
pushing it too far you know you can see
how<00:01:30.700> high<00:01:30.850> my<00:01:31.029> thumbs<00:01:31.270> are<00:01:31.450> up<00:01:31.509> here<00:01:31.779> compared

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
how high my thumbs are up here compared

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.399 
how high my thumbs are up here compared
to<00:01:32.759> its<00:01:33.759> regular<00:01:33.969> controller<00:01:34.509> if<00:01:35.079> you<00:01:35.170> try<00:01:35.349> to

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
to its regular controller if you try to

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:37.800 
to its regular controller if you try to
do<00:01:35.590> small<00:01:36.369> movements<00:01:36.639> the<00:01:37.029> stick<00:01:37.299> still<00:01:37.569> moves

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
do small movements the stick still moves

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.289 
do small movements the stick still moves
pretty<00:01:38.380> good<00:01:38.619> distance<00:01:38.829> so<00:01:39.310> it's<00:01:39.490> a<00:01:39.670> little

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
pretty good distance so it's a little

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:46.769 
pretty good distance so it's a little
harder<00:01:40.630> um<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:43.240> yeah<00:01:43.450> uh<00:01:44.639> you<00:01:45.639> know<00:01:45.700> this<00:01:46.630> is

00:01:46.769 --> 00:01:46.779 
harder um so yeah uh you know this is

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:48.839 
harder um so yeah uh you know this is
