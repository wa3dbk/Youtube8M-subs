00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:22.289
 hello everybody welcome back 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.919

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:29.399

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:31.379
 in its black version black version out there 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:33.960
 You can already find this headset by 

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:36.030
 about 70 dollars and how could you 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.850
 see at the beginning of the video then watching now 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.920
 the packaging of the reservation once again 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.790
 is weak packaging very 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.530
 beautiful 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.390
 in my opinion this is one of the headphones 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.979
 most beautiful on the market and I 've always had 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.920
 willingness to buy it since it was 

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:52.619
 announced how you could see this 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.470
 also has a design or green ii or 

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:57.689
 be hearty field of them will stay on top 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.699
 from your ear and not around your island 

00:00:57.689 --> 00:01:01.920
 like in some headphones that we have in the 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.570
 This phone also has 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.000
 40mm what will provide 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.460
 very serious and probably a good 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.030
 sound quality on a 70 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.060
 dollars and also a retractable microphone 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.090

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.180

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.580
 speaker of one meter and 30 that has 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.310
 Compatibility cell for those 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.159
 I want to walk around on street 1 it went well 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.900
 and with the microphone looking like a 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.390
 telemarketing attendant 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.640
 this was also comes with an extension or 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.409
 splitter that splits the cable signal 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.940
 single speaker input 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.620
 microphone input so that you 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.490
 you can also use this handset in your 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.010
 computer 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.440
 now a big fitch of this phone is with 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:49.200
 the comfort of own kings and 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.390
 announces the headset as the most 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.729
 of the world and I can say 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.530
 that he is certainly one of the most 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.510
 I 've used in my life 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.850
 I can not say with all certainty the 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.470
 world if he is the most comfortable but 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.780
 he is very comfortable as you 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.200
 could see the circuses are extremely 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.519
 soft and they also adjust to almost 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.590
 any one 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:13.709
 so this is it personal this was the first 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.319
 Unboxing Express
