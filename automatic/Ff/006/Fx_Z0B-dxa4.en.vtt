00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.930
 here are the girls and boys myself I will tell 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.450
 you about the frame or rather about what flame 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.699
 don't need the first reason why not 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.830
 flame is what the flame is undermining 

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:17.010
 morale low morale on hardly 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.220
 lead you to victory and people you 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.720
 flame it is unlikely to play better 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.210
 the second reason is that you spend 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.320
 time to chat typing your messages and 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.699
 lose gaming concentration 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.710
 and the worst thing is that you 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.739
 provoke your allies to do something 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.960
 I will tell you the same thing about that moment 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.629
 when all sleep ceased to chat 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.960
 it was a long time ago when I played more and 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:44.600
 the relay I had an account in area 31 and i 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.460
 furiously argued something to his ally 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.000
 I woke up I was already under the tower where me 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.800
 belkin he will become the other I flashed there 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.350
 Well, in general, he killed me 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.730
 She appeared to me he expected and after that not 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.080
 there was no teamfight where we would 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.989
 won because every time 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:03.110
 explodes did she become wore damage and 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.780
 was very nasty and of course that game 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.759
 we lost and was very disappointed because 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.580
 that I had a real chance to drag 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:13.880
 this game if it's not this return to the 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.520
 I never flame about emma 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.670
 useless because the players you 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.900
 chemists will not play better and most 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.880
 the main thing is that 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.670
 the players whom you flame and in fact 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.690
 can actually play well and show 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.390
 cool moves 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.820
 and again if you take an example from 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.340
 recent stream there was such a moment 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.930
 when I break for trust more truly even 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.760
 don't rush in just occupy aggressive 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.510
 position hope that i'm morgan 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.760
 will give me a shield but coffins thrash and kill me 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.400
 of course on stream I say that here 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.410
 Morgana bad type of shield did not give because 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.150
 this killed us all very badly 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.670
 I need a type of noob support 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.790
 try and then this organ is just 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.250
 goes and solo kills two and he 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.530
 account in the area of ​​312 and she is well done 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.990
 i feel a little ashamed 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.210
 all the same I flamed this morgana she 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.100
 Well played and imagine if 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.770
 I started to write something to the chat 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.450
 prove it becomes vvka for 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.800
 that they morgana did not give one strange 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.800
 feed that is 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.349
 understand what I am leading 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.989
 actually move the last part 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:26.090
 what exactly is causing the frame 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:28.700
 and what feelings does a person have when 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.799
 he starts the flame just on flame it 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.989
 nothing but an excuse an excuse 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:35.060
 its pitiful essence and inability 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.280
 win this game and at that moment when 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.189
 some player starts to flame it to you 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.099
 openly declares i am a sucker i am not capable 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:45.459
 think I better put my problems and 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.780
 troubles on and other players 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.239
 actually flame is born one by one 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.219
 simple reason because situations 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.489
 which the person starts to tell 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:57.379
 she already happened and prove something to you 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.299
 the alignment of events is no longer possible therefore 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:01.010
 can come up with a billion development 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:02.750
 of events 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.909
 and each of them will be entitled to 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.610
 life than our own enjoy our 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:09.530
 a hero who begins to flame his 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.099
 team to tell how who should have been 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.769
 to enter 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:16.159
 he doesn't think at all about how to play 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:18.470
 other people and what could be done there 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:20.030
 differently or are there any problems 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.760
 of his troubles every character he 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.510
 just sees takes and does and starts 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.760
 flame it all is nothing more than just 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.739
 excuse he wants to justify himself but here 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.109
 another question before whom to justify 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.930
 and actually if u sit down 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:38.870
 who love the flame they look 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.000
 this video just think about it 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.220
 the deed for which you are flame and sticky you 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.769
 do you want to make excuses before nine 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.049
 players who just got ram 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.849
 randomly in the match even if we consider that 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:53.030
 allies still don't count and you 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:55.519
 want to justify yourself before five enemies and 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.280
 you tell them like you guys are watching 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:01.099
 I'm actually a good player for Well 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.440
 the fact that I do not gandar jandar line 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:05.720
 I can not defend it and in fact I 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.480
 good player and you me 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.760
 win or no one is like noob it 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.650
 just how to keep bernie coming himself 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.799
 it's funny when you understand 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:19.039
 the true essence of the flame so I think that 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:21.760
 could open your eyes a little and you 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:24.610
 will now flame less 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.470
 those who time it you will over them 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.800
 laugh just like me so 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.480
 flame is meaningless because 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.210
 players won't play better if you're on 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.310
 they will swear in the second player 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:40.060
 can play well he just doesn't 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.980
 something happened flame is bad for 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.320
 the game because you spend time and 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.500
 lose concentration plus undermine 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:50.580
 fighting spirit and most importantly the essence of the flame 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:53.350
 this is an excuse the people who flame they 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.960
 justify their miserable existence and 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.430
 unable to drag the game 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.520
 see you soon there was hope 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.520
 is useful
