00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.979
 country country country country country 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:13.230
 hello today we are going to work with porta 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.810
 gift cards every time is over 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.790
 fashion to give these cards then 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.610
 let's do something so we do not lose 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:23.250
 that personal touch in our gift 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.650
 let's work with a strip of paper 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.380
 that is a little wider than the card 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.830
 and more or less twice as long 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.949
 then I will measure with my card and 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.769
 I'm going to mark a fold more or less to the 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:41.100
 half of my card so that after 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:44.870
 I can enter it in this way now 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:49.320
 I'm going to decorate with snow flex all the 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:52.350
 background of my card and I will add some 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:56.829
 little eyes to be able to hold it from this 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:00.670
 shape I pasted already a decorated paper 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:03.010
 and now he stamped a label that I'm going to 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.460
 cut out leaving a little filito 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.619
 around and I'm going to stamp my sentence and 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.320
 here I cut my stamp to be able 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:15.970
 accommodate as I want it inside of me 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:19.390
 tag this way then I stick it 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:23.679
 now you add dimension tape 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:26.830
 some snow snow flex and ready is ready 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:28.470
 my door cards and now we're going to 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.760
 number 2 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:36.030
 for this I'm going to mark the width again 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:39.630
 of my card frame folds to both 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:43.500
 sides so that I stay bent in 3 you 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.450
 I already pasted some decorated paper and 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.670
 here I am carrying half of my 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.910
 card to make a small 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:55.470
 piercing to make it more obvious 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:02:00.600
 that hole in this way and now I'm going to 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:03.659
 stick the edges with this glue 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.960
 which is very strong and leaves a layer 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:10.709
 very thin now stick paper now in the 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:14.069
 top and you hit this escalo 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:16.890
 white here stamped my stamp that I'm going to 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:20.380
 place in this frame and I'm going to paste it 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:24.970
 with dimension tape 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:27.000
 in this way and I'm going to introduce my 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:31.730
 card 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.730
 inside my card holder 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:40.060
 and it stays that way 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.060
 and quickly we go to number 3 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.110
 here I will mark a fold 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:52.080
 every quarter inch 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.950
 on the two narrowest sides and in one 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.950
 of the long 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.940
 each one of these to a quarter of an inch 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.760
 and here, as you can see, I have a 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:08.260
 small little box in each one of those 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:12.159
 corners then I'm going to cut it 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:17.670
 and I'm going to cut a little eyelash in 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:17.670
 each of these sides in this way 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:24.800
 and then on both sides 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.800
 of these lines 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:31.120
 now I'm going to work with boxing 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:35.520
 then I use my talc tool and 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.520
 I'm going to stamp my image with brand verza 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.900
 thus 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.220
 pressed my image very well so that it 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:48.410
 it is very well printed 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:49.970
 and now I sprinkle with glitter I 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.180
 I used a common glitter and 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:56.210
 stream and look how beautiful it looks and what 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.980
 what I'm going to do is dry 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:01.740
 well rather apply heat with my 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:04.440
 gun to fix the glitter 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:08.090
 and now I'm going to paste the paper that was 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:11.400
 previously folded in each of these 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.120
 eyelashes I'm going to apply glue and what 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.780
 I'm going to paste 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.120
 here I have and company my label that I'm going 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:23.490
 to trim flush 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:26.320
 rounding my top corners and ready 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:29.260
 I already add a little bit of ribbon and 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.130
 it was ready for the next portal 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.729
 cards 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:35.860
 I'm going to use this piece of paper what 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:38.830
 I'm going to fold in half remembering 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.440
 always the width of my card and once 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:45.550
 more I'm going to measure 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:51.310
 and more or less I'm going to leave a space of 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:53.650
 an inch and a half to be able to bend 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:58.180
 since I have here marked my folds 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:05:00.040
 I'm going to cut back to the fold and the 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.720
 half 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:08.450
 I'm going to cut tabs again 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:13.080
 in the corners and now with an exact 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:16.540
 I'm going to cut a small slot in the 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:20.760
 half and before reaching the fold 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.760
 to be able to pass thread there 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:29.000
 here I will put the exact one to open a 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.330
 little bit this slot and be able to pass the 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.330
 thread 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:38.729
 and I will use two colors of yarn 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:43.289
 to give it a little more interest 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:47.539
 and I'm going to help with a pair of tweezers 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:47.539
 can pass the thread to the other side 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.230
 thus 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:59.910
 Halo then the thread and I'll give you two 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.910
 turns 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:05.809
 since as a child in these two laps 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:09.529
 I'm going to add a glute to me 

00:06:05.809 --> 00:06:11.330
 help fix the thread and I will insert it 

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:15.490
 in a button 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:19.100
 which I will knot with a bow 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:22.210
 then in jump 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.210
 From both sides 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:28.949
 and adjusted it 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:33.289
 since I have this ready now I'm going to 

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:33.289
 paste alone to the center 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:40.930
 of the tabs so that it holds 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.930
 that side only to the center 

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:46.720
 here I put a small step 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:49.210
 more to give it a nicer touch and I'll 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:52.510
 to stick two buttons on the end 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:54.670
 top right to get a 

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:56.280
 most beautiful view in front of my porta 

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:59.220
 cards 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:02.790
 and now I'm going to use a bit of 

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:06.000
 cardboard and I'm going to decorate it in the 

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:07.800
 top with these snow flakes and this 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.270
 little piece of cardboard he wants to use 

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:14.700
 to stamp my sentence and in case I want 

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:18.690
 write something to the recipient of my 

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:22.740
 card then this card holder we 

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:25.320
 gives the option to place a card in 

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:29.009
 that we can write something more the 

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:31.710
 gift card this way 

00:07:29.009 --> 00:07:34.559
 and with this we finish our projects 

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:37.949
 today very hurried but we had to 

00:07:34.559 --> 00:07:39.479
 end here I show you all I hope 

00:07:37.949 --> 00:07:41.879
 what you liked and thank you very much 

00:07:39.479 --> 00:07:44.300
 for joining me see you next 

00:07:41.879 --> 00:07:44.300
 week
