 nature policy old need here at this table does absolutely no one to 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:22.579
 regrettable 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:26.549
 always make music pay excellent for the other variety on the game forest 

00:00:26.549 --> 00:00:30.879
 then you can of course discuss it very important the weather itself was 

00:00:30.879 --> 00:00:32.260
 with the and young ajax 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.590
 update at the nmbs for the analyzes is always available as well as the order 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.020
 yes but there went the first 750,000 guilders johan cruyff 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.680
 ranocchia game forest ammunition residues cause the children's channel to leave with vitesse 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.490
 with that of that crybaby the parool albers nevertheless nice four and a half tons of 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.490
 farewell got the bonus that lady there is worth 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.839
 alphia so I'd rather not talk about that 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:00:58.720
 but also not missing 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.630
 the viewer sodemieter they listen to the ww before you know it is with me too 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.920
 can be the fiat on a chair 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.560
 she gets he fights seven hundred venture I help two accidents before 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.280
 partly by a telephone 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.680
 although that is not something about that on television someday that will also go well 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.659
 just do that 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.749
 that amount of those Zevenhoven tinder box correctly I can not say what in the liver 

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:22.350
 and then we can preserve game forest for public service broadcasters 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.810
 Having achieved this week I must say I speak Johan Legemaate 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:26.690
 that a 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.430
 van der mooren on the phone but they had 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.110
 handing in years younger are two concepts that do not go well together 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.000
 nyenrode anyway i almost don't believe that you are able to put it on the facade 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.530
 also no no get there this is it is so in your soul 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.240
 act that is also my problem i have to draw a line madam poker tournament 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.830
 stopping means analyzing everything but what I also come across with a nice one 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:52.200
 women 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.070
 and how I analyzed the bill of the week at the song festival and 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.500
 crops yes yes yes that's why overs do not have to feel sorry for the 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.740
 participants of the song festival relationship paid well for that, well 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.550
 you can discuss about it by hamas my name 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.800
 I'm watching football japan had you can end at the big board with all that 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.930
 names and writers asks for euros 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.330
 I'm just automatically analyzing that and I say to madam 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.330
 I think the Icelandic sign 

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:25.879
 the hard stump was a beam over a house on most points 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:31.439
 oldest winner but yes I say it's the end he comes this joop who 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:34.899
 therefore strong performance there comes a time and that says and is the winner 

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:38.420
 Iceland it is incredible year year 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.879
 it's a gave the nhl 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:46.890
 yes, I think that and what it meant at the time is sense in a press release and 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:50.179
 that the other one she always ends up with from a play forest 

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:53.789
 in content year it is a mix of the news service from vtm column 

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:57.639
 van spelbos the magazine could have given some more in to hand in hand mine 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:00.799
 offer is not so on in the Alps to a reader I am not interested in anything 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:01.770
 a victory 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.090
 and then my reading are interested in the person behind the soccer player 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.310
 john interested but would like to attend new lectures 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.759

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.959
 years just what your favorite books have kidnapping from heineken 

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:21.619
 a motion of vliet the colors blue 

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:26.869
 and what your favorite festival your song festival the eurovision song festival 

00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:31.629
 so for the second in five years you you want to have won yes 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:34.799
 to show people what year to come 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:39.159
 say that end of the competition is approaching spartacus in trouble 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:40.469
 Hanegem actually did it 

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:43.599
 well i think willem van hanegem did an excellent job it says 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:46.509
 very well paid by the board of sparta fans 

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:49.559
 no one but I don't mean that you no longer expect it 

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:52.779
 well I expected that if we want to, but if you don't go on that often anymore 

00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:54.410
 yes Marian trough waiting 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.500
 but i didn't get the real balanced result actually hit three half 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.669
 tons to an excellent result 

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:03.629
 Normally there are but the competition is almost over 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:06.999
 you are here now you hope final analysis 

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:10.280
 well if you just ask me look at the competition 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.539
 psv 

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:12.949
 there are five 

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:14.469
 the slats 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:18.750
 no but I have seen your past neighborhoods through eindhoven visor end yes I do 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.859
 he thought, I can't take them out of your hands anymore 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.800
 Wijchen on the other hand rcc roosendaal you have to go very well 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.400
 be careful because the animals and the show from rens are not paying attention but then you have 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.889
 so feyenoord next to gigs yes but the ranking of sizes is second if you so 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.910
 therefore it is no longer possible to go above or below, so they remain a stack and then 

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:40.259
 you have all the responses 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:42.270
 they can still be third track 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.749
 but it all depends on the number of points that satyam 

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:49.809
 look it is so if you win you stand three points 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:52.050
 after the show in show yes 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.979
 then you have been hurt so much I now look three points 7 in the case now if you 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:57.639
 loses 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:01.039
 so your other. your other happens to be in the spotlight 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:05.910
 yeah and then you shoot in the stand you just shoot nothing on the agenda should be alert 

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:07.499
 looking forward enormously 

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:11.360
 I live here with a bunch of empty fanned parties in my own house with 2 in the audience 

00:05:11.359 --> 00:05:15.189
 found vitesse they have lost years held well if you here what 

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:16.240
 I'm afraid Karadzic 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.139
 points race birthday 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:23.659
 yes and thank you very much source ad I am pretty sure we are going 

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:28.240
 very soon your analyzes still miss very much that proved in tholen sport 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.670
 then we will close this broadcast from outside the plaza in the olympic stadium 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:34.560
 with chain goal of the week I sit every week
