00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
the direct manipulation tool to work on

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.200 
the direct manipulation tool to work on
the<00:00:18.720> pose<00:00:19.260> of<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.529> Ryan<00:00:19.920> figure<00:00:20.310> so<00:00:21.029> I'll

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
the pose of the Ryan figure so I'll

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.240 
the pose of the Ryan figure so I'll
focus<00:00:21.720> on<00:00:21.990> Ryan<00:00:22.289> by<00:00:22.500> dropping<00:00:22.859> down<00:00:23.039> the

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
focus on Ryan by dropping down the

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.490 
focus on Ryan by dropping down the
camera<00:00:23.760> when<00:00:23.910> you<00:00:24.060> hear<00:00:24.449> selecting<00:00:25.410> the

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500

camera when you hear selecting the
posing<00:00:25.830> camera<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.369> then<00:00:27.000> I'll<00:00:27.539> just<00:00:27.599> zoom<00:00:28.170> in

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
posing camera and then I'll just zoom in

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.070 
posing camera and then I'll just zoom in
on<00:00:28.500> Ryan<00:00:28.939> so<00:00:29.939> I<00:00:29.970> can<00:00:30.240> see<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.480> parts<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.840> one<00:00:30.960> to

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
on Ryan so I can see the parts of one to

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.380 
on Ryan so I can see the parts of one to
work<00:00:31.260> on<00:00:31.439> I'll<00:00:31.949> just<00:00:32.369> rotate<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.360> view

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
work on I'll just rotate the view

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.840 
work on I'll just rotate the view
slightly<00:00:34.079> because<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:35.040> first<00:00:35.280> thing<00:00:35.370> I'll<00:00:35.610> do

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850

slightly because the first thing I'll do
is<00:00:36.059> actually<00:00:36.899> hide<00:00:37.380> parts<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.820> figure<00:00:39.090> I

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
is actually hide parts of the figure I

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.790 
is actually hide parts of the figure I
don't<00:00:39.390> want<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.780> manipulate<00:00:39.989> all<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.620> might

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
don't want to manipulate all that might

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.740 
don't want to manipulate all that might
cause<00:00:41.040> problems<00:00:41.160> or<00:00:41.670> mind<00:00:41.820> choosing<00:00:42.300> parts<00:00:42.629> of

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
cause problems or mind choosing parts of

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.990 
cause problems or mind choosing parts of
the<00:00:42.809> body<00:00:42.930> so<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.829> do<00:00:44.070> this<00:00:44.100> i'll<00:00:44.460> use<00:00:44.760> the

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
the body so to do this i'll use the

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.619 
the body so to do this i'll use the
hierarchy<00:00:45.660> editor<00:00:45.960> on<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.170> window<00:00:46.829> menu<00:00:47.039> I

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
hierarchy editor on the window menu I

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.900 
hierarchy editor on the window menu I
just<00:00:48.629> click<00:00:48.870> on<00:00:49.020> that<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:50.460> want<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.760> make

those parts have disappeared it just

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.779 
those parts have disappeared it just
makes<00:00:58.260> it<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.469> bit<00:00:58.590> easier<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:59.160> see<00:00:59.340> Ryan's

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
makes it a bit easier to see Ryan's

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
the shoulder of the figure itself they

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.929 
the shoulder of the figure itself they
were<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:10.320> then<00:01:10.439> I'll<00:01:10.560> click<00:01:10.740> on<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.159> direct

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
manipulation tool and using the circles

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.399 
manipulation tool and using the circles
here<00:01:14.850> I'll<00:01:15.030> just<00:01:15.299> make<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.840> adjustments<00:01:16.320> I

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
here I'll just make the adjustments I

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.380 
here I'll just make the adjustments I
want<00:01:16.650> so<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.369> first<00:01:17.549> thing<00:01:17.670> I'll<00:01:17.880> do<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.060> lift

the shoulder up slightly using the red

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.770 
the shoulder up slightly using the red
circle<00:01:20.869> use<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.900> green<00:01:22.229> circle<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.950> rotate<00:01:23.400> it

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
circle use a green circle to rotate it

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.120 
circle use a green circle to rotate it
rather<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:25.110> other<00:01:25.409> way<00:01:25.799> because<00:01:26.040> it's

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
rather the other way because it's

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.609 
rather the other way because it's
pointing<00:01:26.729> forward<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.960> then<00:01:28.049> use<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.380> blue

pointing forward and then use the blue

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.800 
pointing forward and then use the blue
circle<00:01:29.159> just<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.579> lift<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.150> out<00:01:30.240> away<00:01:30.540> from<00:01:30.570> the

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
circle just to lift it out away from the

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.609 
circle just to lift it out away from the
body<00:01:30.960> slightly<00:01:31.759> the<00:01:32.759> same<00:01:32.939> goes<00:01:33.119> for<00:01:33.570> the

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
body slightly the same goes for the

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.249 
body slightly the same goes for the
forearm<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.299> shoulder<00:01:36.299> so<00:01:37.079> I'll<00:01:37.229> just

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
forearm and the shoulder so I'll just

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.520 
forearm and the shoulder so I'll just
click<00:01:37.829> on<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.369> shoulder<00:01:39.060> here

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
click on the shoulder here

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.270 
click on the shoulder here
this<00:01:41.250> time<00:01:41.460> I'll<00:01:41.580> use<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.909> red<00:01:42.150> circle<00:01:42.390> to

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
this time I'll use the red circle to

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.530 
this time I'll use the red circle to
twist<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.430> arm<00:01:44.580> in<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.790> direction<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.210> want<00:01:45.420> it

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
twist the arm in the direction I want it

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.390 
twist the arm in the direction I want it
to<00:01:45.570> point<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.260> then<00:01:46.650> i'll<00:01:46.770> use<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:47.220> green

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
to point and then i'll use the green

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.060 
to point and then i'll use the green
circle<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.970> lift<00:01:48.150> it<00:01:48.299> up<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.690> on<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.530> 40<00:01:49.860> and

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
circle to lift it up and on the 40 and

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.609 
circle to lift it up and on the 40 and
then<00:01:50.190> i'll<00:01:50.340> make<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.549> bend<00:01:50.909> down<00:01:51.119> words

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
then i'll make that bend down words

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.280 
then i'll make that bend down words
again<00:01:52.619> using<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:52.950> green<00:01:53.220> circle<00:01:53.990> to<00:01:54.990> bend<00:01:55.200> it

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
again using the green circle to bend it

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.010 
again using the green circle to bend it
forward<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.550> i'll<00:01:56.700> just<00:01:57.000> check<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.720> posed

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
forward and i'll just check that posed

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.060 
forward and i'll just check that posed
by<00:01:58.320> rotating<00:01:58.790> now<00:01:59.790> i<00:01:59.850> need<00:01:59.970> to<00:02:00.270> move<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.720> arm

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
by rotating now i need to move the arm

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.020 
by rotating now i need to move the arm
in<00:02:02.070> slightly<00:02:02.820> so<00:02:03.750> i'll<00:02:04.020> go<00:02:04.229> back<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.740> the

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
in slightly so i'll go back to the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.120 
in slightly so i'll go back to the
shoulder<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.210> i'll<00:02:06.720> just<00:02:07.080> bring<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:07.920> in

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
shoulder and i'll just bring that in

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.609 
shoulder and i'll just bring that in
slightly<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:08.970> rotate<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.840> using<00:02:10.380> the<00:02:10.410> red

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
slightly and rotate it using the red

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.910 
slightly and rotate it using the red
circle<00:02:10.890> that's<00:02:11.730> slightly<00:02:12.150> better<00:02:12.769> now<00:02:13.769> i'll

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
circle that's slightly better now i'll

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.740 
circle that's slightly better now i'll
come<00:02:14.100> back<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.430> forearm<00:02:14.850> and<00:02:15.330> i<00:02:15.510> want<00:02:15.690> to

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
come back to the forearm and i want to

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.080 
come back to the forearm and i want to
twist<00:02:15.959> that<00:02:16.170> slightly<00:02:16.560> so<00:02:16.860> again<00:02:17.130> i'll<00:02:17.760> just

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
twist that slightly so again i'll just

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.930 
twist that slightly so again i'll just
use<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.720> red<00:02:19.290> circle<00:02:19.530> here<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.519> twist<00:02:20.820> it

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
use the red circle here to twist it

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.060 
use the red circle here to twist it
about<00:02:21.209> that<00:02:21.420> plane<00:02:21.690> now<00:02:22.560> i'm<00:02:22.680> going<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:22.920> be

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
about that plane now i'm going to be

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.370 
about that plane now i'm going to be
doing<00:02:23.160> more<00:02:23.459> to<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.730> hand<00:02:23.970> a<00:02:24.390> little<00:02:24.630> later<00:02:24.989> so

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
doing more to the hand a little later so

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.380 
doing more to the hand a little later so
i'll<00:02:25.530> leave<00:02:25.560> that<00:02:25.739> for<00:02:26.069> the<00:02:26.100> moment<00:02:26.310> now<00:02:26.640> i'll

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
i'll leave that for the moment now i'll

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.490 
i'll leave that for the moment now i'll
come<00:02:27.630> back<00:02:27.780> up<00:02:28.019> to<00:02:28.050> the<00:02:28.519> hierarchy<00:02:29.519> editor<00:02:29.850> and

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
come back up to the hierarchy editor and

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.699 
come back up to the hierarchy editor and
make<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.800> mac<00:02:32.220> arm<00:02:32.489> visible<00:02:33.300> again<00:02:33.569> and<00:02:33.780> a-rod

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
make the mac arm visible again and a-rod

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.770 
make the mac arm visible again and a-rod
opposes<00:02:35.250> just<00:02:35.459> about<00:02:35.670> right<00:02:35.940> i'll<00:02:36.150> just<00:02:36.450> zoom

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
opposes just about right i'll just zoom

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.449 
opposes just about right i'll just zoom
in<00:02:36.959> on<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.260> shoulder<00:02:37.800> piece<00:02:37.980> there<00:02:38.220> to<00:02:38.340> make

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
in on the shoulder piece there to make

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.210 
in on the shoulder piece there to make
sure<00:02:38.519> that's<00:02:38.880> not<00:02:39.380> intersecting<00:02:40.380> Ryan's

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
sure that's not intersecting Ryan's

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.840 
sure that's not intersecting Ryan's
bicep<00:02:41.880> I<00:02:42.150> think<00:02:42.690> it<00:02:42.840> is<00:02:42.870> slightly<00:02:43.650> so<00:02:44.579> let's

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
bicep I think it is slightly so let's

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.490 
bicep I think it is slightly so let's
just<00:02:45.090> come<00:02:45.269> in<00:02:45.420> there<00:02:45.630> yes<00:02:45.870> you<00:02:46.079> can<00:02:46.200> see<00:02:46.380> it's

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
just come in there yes you can see it's

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.680 
just come in there yes you can see it's
intersecting<00:02:47.220> there<00:02:47.459> that's<00:02:48.180> a<00:02:48.329> little<00:02:48.570> bit

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
intersecting there that's a little bit

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.770 
intersecting there that's a little bit
undesirable<00:02:49.410> so<00:02:50.100> to<00:02:50.160> fix<00:02:50.640> that<00:02:51.090> I'll<00:02:51.420> just

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
undesirable so to fix that I'll just

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.259 
undesirable so to fix that I'll just
click<00:02:52.200> on<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.769> shoulder<00:02:53.459> piece<00:02:53.610> itself<00:02:53.970> and

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
click on the shoulder piece itself and

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:55.759 
click on the shoulder piece itself and
see<00:02:54.390> if<00:02:54.510> I<00:02:54.600> can<00:02:54.750> do<00:02:54.870> anything<00:02:55.079> with<00:02:55.410> the

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
see if I can do anything with the

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:58.250 
see if I can do anything with the
manipulation<00:02:56.730> tool<00:02:56.970> so<00:02:57.239> I'll<00:02:57.390> just<00:02:57.420> end<00:02:57.959> that

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
manipulation tool so I'll just end that

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.430 
manipulation tool so I'll just end that
slightly<00:02:59.150> now<00:03:00.150> that's<00:03:00.390> making<00:03:00.600> it<00:03:00.900> rotates

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
slightly now that's making it rotates

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.650 
slightly now that's making it rotates
even<00:03:01.950> further<00:03:02.160> into<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.579> bicep<00:03:02.970> so<00:03:03.600> to

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
even further into the bicep so to

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.530 
even further into the bicep so to
correct<00:03:04.260> that<00:03:04.410> I'll<00:03:04.739> click<00:03:05.070> on<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.760> shoulder

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
correct that I'll click on the shoulder

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.140 
correct that I'll click on the shoulder
piece<00:03:06.690> again<00:03:06.840> I'll<00:03:07.430> turn<00:03:08.430> off<00:03:08.549> the<00:03:08.670> hierarchy

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
piece again I'll turn off the hierarchy

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.030 
piece again I'll turn off the hierarchy
editor<00:03:09.540> as<00:03:10.049> you<00:03:10.170> can<00:03:10.260> see<00:03:10.440> i<00:03:10.470> selected<00:03:11.010> the

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
editor as you can see i selected the

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.789 
editor as you can see i selected the
shoulder<00:03:11.459> armor<00:03:11.760> here<00:03:12.030> so<00:03:12.540> i'll<00:03:12.720> come<00:03:13.260> down<00:03:13.290> to

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
shoulder armor here so i'll come down to

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.710 
shoulder armor here so i'll come down to
the<00:03:13.950> translation<00:03:14.640> tools<00:03:14.910> here<00:03:15.269> at<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.540> bottom

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
the translation tools here at the bottom

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.890 
the translation tools here at the bottom
of<00:03:16.049> the<00:03:16.410> parameters<00:03:16.859> palette<00:03:17.549> I'll<00:03:18.299> dial<00:03:18.720> the

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
of the parameters palette I'll dial the

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.310 
of the parameters palette I'll dial the
Y<00:03:19.620> translation<00:03:20.370> up<00:03:20.549> slightly<00:03:21.120> just<00:03:21.630> to<00:03:21.780> make

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
Y translation up slightly just to make

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.009 
Y translation up slightly just to make
it<00:03:22.350> clear<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:23.190> bicep<00:03:23.690> make<00:03:24.690> it<00:03:24.840> come<00:03:24.989> back

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
it clear the bicep make it come back

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.780 
it clear the bicep make it come back
into<00:03:25.350> it<00:03:25.500> again<00:03:25.560> to<00:03:25.829> see<00:03:26.070> how<00:03:26.220> much<00:03:26.340> I<00:03:26.519> need<00:03:26.700> to

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
into it again to see how much I need to

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.229 
into it again to see how much I need to
do<00:03:26.940> that<00:03:27.209> and<00:03:28.160> probably<00:03:29.160> about<00:03:29.730> there<00:03:30.060> is

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
do that and probably about there is

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.720 
do that and probably about there is
right<00:03:30.480> so<00:03:31.079> that's<00:03:31.410> set<00:03:31.709> up<00:03:31.890> now<00:03:32.070> I'll<00:03:32.430> come

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
right so that's set up now I'll come

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.940 
right so that's set up now I'll come
back<00:03:32.880> into<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.299> main<00:03:33.510> view<00:03:34.140> I<00:03:34.170> set<00:03:34.470> up<00:03:34.590> earlier

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
back into the main view I set up earlier

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.849 
back into the main view I set up earlier
on<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.549> auxiliary<00:03:35.850> camera<00:03:36.329> and<00:03:36.530> the<00:03:37.530> arm<00:03:37.709> is

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
on the auxiliary camera and the arm is

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.500 
on the auxiliary camera and the arm is
now<00:03:37.980> pointing<00:03:38.250> in<00:03:38.549> the<00:03:38.609> direction<00:03:38.640> I<00:03:39.120> want<00:03:39.329> it

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
now pointing in the direction I want it

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.690 
now pointing in the direction I want it
to
