00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:06.830
 hello welcome I want to show you in 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.830
 this video an album that I made for 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.830
 baby 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.350
 this time use the collection of 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.310
 music 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:21.240
 2014 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.029
 and good also use 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.939
 of printables of the angels grace 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:31.710
 jones are not distant that's the kit 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.960
 printable that the truth is great if 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.820
 you want to make invitations or if you want 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.250
 use it for example to do this 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.400
 something this is a low low image of the 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.660
 good network let's start I did it in 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.760
 shape of diapers 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.520
 It looks like a little bag I just added it 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.160
 with lace the handles and well I think so 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.640
 I think that it resembles a little bit what 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.940
 is the diaper to close I put a 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.550
 magnet clasp 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.800
 It opens in this way and good too 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.680
 here has what resembles a 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.840
 a pocket 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.810
 which is really a little notebook for 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.810
 that put some thoughts for the 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.510
 baby either the baby shower or already in the 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.350
 birth and I also put him with blanket 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:21.060
 a pocket so that it goes so that it goes 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.840
 a quilÃ¡ 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.680
 the notebook with some stamps I put baby boy 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.570
 and nothing more in tint of everything for everyone 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.080
 sides to make it look a little bit more 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:37.660
 nice and good when opening 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:41.320
 we are already with all the pages 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:43.210
 decorated also use the set of 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.100
 the index demos collection is the one that 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.730
 mark the calendar that is the set of 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:51.450
 trip this is from the angels james jones 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.450
 these images 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.120
 I put you here a eiffel tower because 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:01.140
 good 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:04.350
 babies are supposed to come from there and 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.720
 comes this little leaf with this decoration in 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.970
 the cut-out sheet and I really liked it 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.970
 for mom to name and 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.730
 nationality of the baby because then the 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.770
 dads are Venezuelans a moderation of 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.210
 solana but then the baby will do 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.980
 here in mexico so they are going to be able 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.280
 generate also with photographs here 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.720

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.770
 a phrase that says I love you I love you I love you 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.230
 I love you if you do not know I do not know if you know 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.660

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.700

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.710

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.660
