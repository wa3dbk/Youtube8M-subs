your<00:00:34.200> basic<00:00:34.710> manual<00:00:35.520> instructions<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.360> believe

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
your basic manual instructions I believe

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.780 
your basic manual instructions I believe
in<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:37.140> comes<00:00:37.410> in<00:00:37.620> several<00:00:37.950> languages<00:00:38.790> and

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
of course it's going to have the Cassiel

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:52.880 
of course it's going to have the Cassiel
warranty<00:00:44.610> card<00:00:44.850> with<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.300> as<00:00:45.930> well<00:00:51.710> but<00:00:52.710> this

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
warranty card with it as well but this

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.990 
warranty card with it as well but this
is<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:53.100> very<00:00:53.370> lightweight<00:00:53.850> very<00:00:54.329> basic<00:00:55.079> watch

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
is a very lightweight very basic watch

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.849 
is a very lightweight very basic watch
let's<00:00:57.000> get<00:00:57.149> this<00:00:57.300> out<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.750> case<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:58.590> we<00:00:58.680> can

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
let's get this out of the case so we can

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:10.820 
let's get this out of the case so we can
actually<00:00:59.960> actually<00:01:00.960> get<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.469> opened<00:01:09.650> but<00:01:10.650> it

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
actually actually get it opened but it

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.499 
actually actually get it opened but it
is<00:01:10.950> gonna<00:01:11.220> have<00:01:11.400> four<00:01:11.700> basic<00:01:13.010> buttons<00:01:14.010> so<00:01:14.509> this

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
is gonna have four basic buttons so this

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.969 
is gonna have four basic buttons so this
one<00:01:15.689> right<00:01:15.810> here<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.350> course<00:01:16.619> going<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.860> be

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
one right here is of course going to be

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.410 
one right here is of course going to be
the<00:01:17.100> light<00:01:17.540> turns<00:01:18.540> light<00:01:18.869> green<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:20.420> don't

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
the light turns light green and don't

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.060 
the light turns light green and don't
think<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:21.720> don't<00:01:21.900> really<00:01:22.110> like<00:01:22.350> about<00:01:22.380> this<00:01:22.830> is

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
think I don't really like about this is

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.719 
think I don't really like about this is
it's<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:24.360> only<00:01:24.600> turns<00:01:24.960> on<00:01:25.080> for<00:01:25.439> 2<00:01:25.799> seconds<00:01:26.400> sigh

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
it's it only turns on for 2 seconds sigh

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.130 
it's it only turns on for 2 seconds sigh
I<00:01:26.970> wish<00:01:27.119> would<00:01:27.450> have<00:01:27.540> been<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.659> little<00:01:27.810> longer

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
I wish would have been a little longer

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.969 
I wish would have been a little longer
than<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.880> your<00:01:29.880> basic<00:01:30.270> alarm<00:01:31.140> function<00:01:33.979> your

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
than that your basic alarm function your

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:47.289 
than that your basic alarm function your
stopwatch

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.380 

and<00:01:47.390> you're<00:01:48.259> different<00:01:48.829> time<00:01:49.460> zone<00:01:49.820> that<00:01:50.299> you

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
and you're different time zone that you

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.160 
and you're different time zone that you
can<00:01:50.570> set<00:01:52.090> another<00:01:53.090> thing<00:01:53.390> that<00:01:53.570> is<00:01:53.659> missing<00:01:53.869> in

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
can set another thing that is missing in

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.440 
can set another thing that is missing in
this<00:01:54.259> watch<00:01:54.530> is<00:01:54.890> a<00:01:55.100> timer

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450

hi<00:01:56.630> I<00:01:56.960> actually<00:01:57.350> think<00:01:57.649> it's<00:01:57.860> very<00:01:58.039> useful<00:01:58.399> but

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
hi I actually think it's very useful but

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.179 
hi I actually think it's very useful but
I<00:01:59.090> wish<00:01:59.329> they<00:01:59.509> would<00:01:59.659> also<00:02:00.049> add<00:02:00.530> that<00:02:00.560> to<00:02:01.100> the

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
I wish they would also add that to the

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:02.919 
I wish they would also add that to the
watch<00:02:01.539> this

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
this watch is made in China and it has a

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:13.479 
this watch is made in China and it has a
very<00:02:06.950> basic<00:02:07.880> basic<00:02:09.459> band<00:02:11.470> so<00:02:12.470> let's<00:02:12.890> try<00:02:13.250> it<00:02:13.340> on

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
very basic basic band so let's try it on

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.100 
very basic basic band so let's try it on
so<00:02:13.790> you<00:02:13.849> guys<00:02:14.000> can<00:02:14.239> get<00:02:14.420> a<00:02:14.450> better<00:02:14.629> idea<00:02:14.810> what

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
so you guys can get a better idea what

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.860 
so you guys can get a better idea what
it<00:02:15.260> looks<00:02:15.440> like<00:02:15.650> I<00:02:16.459> think<00:02:16.760> it's<00:02:17.150> a<00:02:17.269> very<00:02:17.480> good

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
it looks like I think it's a very good

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.400 
it looks like I think it's a very good
size<00:02:18.110> it's<00:02:18.440> very<00:02:18.500> lightweight<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:20.900> watch<00:02:21.110> is

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
size it's very lightweight the watch is

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:28.300 
size it's very lightweight the watch is
only<00:02:21.590> one<00:02:22.040> point<00:02:22.310> one<00:02:22.579> three<00:02:22.880> ounces<00:02:25.660> and<00:02:27.310> here

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
only one point one three ounces and here

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.229 
only one point one three ounces and here
it<00:02:28.400> is<00:02:28.519> a<00:02:29.049> test<00:02:30.049> in<00:02:30.530> a<00:02:30.709> night<00:02:31.010> like<00:02:31.940> I<00:02:31.970> said

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
it is a test in a night like I said

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.300 
it is a test in a night like I said
really<00:02:32.599> if<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:33.079> the<00:02:33.410> green<00:02:33.650> light<00:02:33.860> is<00:02:33.980> very

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
really if the the green light is very

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.449 
really if the the green light is very
bright<00:02:34.690> and<00:02:35.690> it's<00:02:36.200> very<00:02:36.500> useful<00:02:39.220> diameter<00:02:40.220> of

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
bright and it's very useful diameter of

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.210 
bright and it's very useful diameter of
this<00:02:40.940> watch<00:02:41.150> is<00:02:41.360> 37<00:02:41.989> millimeters<00:02:42.620> in<00:02:42.980> the

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
this watch is 37 millimeters in the

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.680 
this watch is 37 millimeters in the
thickness<00:02:43.549> is<00:02:43.970> 11<00:02:44.739> millimeters<00:02:46.180> let's<00:02:47.180> take<00:02:47.660> a

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
thickness is 11 millimeters let's take a

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.660 
thickness is 11 millimeters let's take a
better<00:02:47.930> look<00:02:48.079> a<00:02:48.560> close-up<00:02:49.069> of<00:02:49.190> what<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:49.519> watch

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
better look a close-up of what the watch

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:56.229 
better look a close-up of what the watch
looks<00:02:50.030> like<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:55.280> main<00:02:55.459> reason<00:02:55.790> why<00:02:55.880> I<00:02:55.910> bought

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
looks like the main reason why I bought

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:57.879 
looks like the main reason why I bought
this<00:02:56.450> watch<00:02:56.660> was<00:02:57.019> really<00:02:57.350> because<00:02:57.620> it<00:02:57.769> was

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:57.889 
this watch was really because it was

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:00.129 
this watch was really because it was
inexpensive<00:02:58.690> just<00:02:59.690> needed<00:02:59.930> something

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:00.139 
inexpensive just needed something

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:03.099 
inexpensive just needed something
reliable<00:03:00.530> something<00:03:01.220> lightweight<00:03:01.459> I<00:03:02.109> just

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.109 
reliable something lightweight I just

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:04.420 
reliable something lightweight I just
wanted<00:03:03.380> a<00:03:03.500> watch<00:03:03.680> that<00:03:04.010> doesn't<00:03:04.310> really

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
wanted a watch that doesn't really

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.660 
wanted a watch that doesn't really
attract<00:03:04.850> too<00:03:05.120> much<00:03:05.150> attention<00:03:06.040> but<00:03:07.040> though

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
attract too much attention but though

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.610 
attract too much attention but though
just<00:03:08.389> by<00:03:08.480> looking<00:03:08.780> at<00:03:08.840> the<00:03:08.989> reviews<00:03:09.319> on<00:03:09.470> the

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
just by looking at the reviews on the

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.009 
just by looking at the reviews on the
Amazon<00:03:10.069> it<00:03:10.400> looks<00:03:10.700> like<00:03:10.940> the<00:03:11.720> biggest

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
Amazon it looks like the biggest

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.250 
Amazon it looks like the biggest
complaint<00:03:12.590> is<00:03:12.739> that<00:03:12.799> the<00:03:13.160> risk<00:03:13.400> that<00:03:13.959> the<00:03:14.959> band

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
complaint is that the risk that the band

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
complaint is that the risk that the band
does<00:03:16.599> it<00:03:17.599> does<00:03:17.840> break<00:03:18.139> off<00:03:18.380> once<00:03:18.920> in<00:03:19.069> a<00:03:19.099> while

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
does it does break off once in a while

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.400 
does it does break off once in a while
like<00:03:19.609> after<00:03:20.030> a<00:03:20.060> few<00:03:20.560> years<00:03:21.560> of<00:03:21.829> using<00:03:22.069> it<00:03:22.340> but

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
like after a few years of using it but

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.430 
like after a few years of using it but
it's<00:03:24.410> only<00:03:24.680> $17<00:03:25.400> so<00:03:25.790> I<00:03:26.090> think<00:03:26.870> worst<00:03:27.230> case

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
it's only $17 so I think worst case

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.740 
it's only $17 so I think worst case
scenario<00:03:27.829> just<00:03:28.069> buy<00:03:28.609> another<00:03:28.639> watch<00:03:29.209> here's
