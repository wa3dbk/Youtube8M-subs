that we're going to put in we're gonna
put<00:00:36.340> both<00:00:36.460> bolts<00:00:36.879> in<00:00:37.000> but<00:00:37.210> you're<00:00:37.390> only<00:00:37.510> going

00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:37.719 
put both bolts in but you're only going

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:39.479 
put both bolts in but you're only going
to<00:00:37.780> Snug<00:00:38.050> one<00:00:38.440> when<00:00:38.829> we<00:00:38.920> put<00:00:39.100> the<00:00:39.219> grille<00:00:39.460> guard

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
to Snug one when we put the grille guard

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:41.069 
to Snug one when we put the grille guard
up<00:00:39.850> there<00:00:40.030> and<00:00:40.149> tighten<00:00:40.300> that<00:00:40.570> that<00:00:40.750> allows

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
up there and tighten that that allows

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:42.930 
up there and tighten that that allows
that<00:00:41.350> to<00:00:41.410> online<00:00:41.829> this<00:00:42.070> way<00:00:42.280> it<00:00:42.460> helps<00:00:42.579> you<00:00:42.790> get

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
that to online this way it helps you get

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.910 
that to online this way it helps you get
a<00:00:43.000> square<00:00:43.480> underneath<00:00:43.780> and<00:00:44.290> then<00:00:44.620> you<00:00:44.739> can

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
a square underneath and then you can

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.819 
a square underneath and then you can
tighten<00:00:45.250> both<00:00:45.399> them<00:00:45.579> up<00:00:45.730> to<00:00:45.879> throw<00:00:46.059> cards<00:00:46.269> home

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
tighten both them up to throw cards home

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.410 
tighten both them up to throw cards home
but<00:00:47.829> again<00:00:48.159> let's<00:00:48.370> say<00:00:48.489> the<00:00:48.640> flat<00:00:49.059> side<00:00:49.329> the

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
but again let's say the flat side the

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.020 
but again let's say the flat side the
practicals<00:00:49.989> to<00:00:50.140> the<00:00:50.229> outside<00:00:50.620> of<00:00:50.879> this<00:00:51.879> is

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
practicals to the outside of this is

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.180 
practicals to the outside of this is
going<00:00:52.210> to<00:00:52.269> be<00:00:52.329> your<00:00:52.449> upper<00:00:52.809> bracket<00:00:53.320> whenever

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
going to be your upper bracket whenever

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.439 
going to be your upper bracket whenever
you're<00:00:54.370> putting<00:00:54.519> it<00:00:54.729> in<00:00:54.820> there<00:00:55.059> we're<00:00:55.329> going

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 
you're putting it in there we're going

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:57.729 
to show you the bolt on that one to the

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:01.710 
to show you the bolt on that one to the
hole<00:00:58.390> those<00:00:59.290> is<00:00:59.949> offset<00:01:00.699> to<00:01:00.909> one<00:01:00.939> side<00:01:01.390> that's

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
hole those is offset to one side that's

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.350 
hole those is offset to one side that's
gonna<00:01:01.930> go<00:01:02.229> the<00:01:02.769> side<00:01:03.159> the<00:01:03.339> hole<00:01:03.519> is<00:01:03.699> offset<00:01:04.210> to

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
gonna go the side the hole is offset to

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.210 
gonna go the side the hole is offset to
is<00:01:04.540> gonna<00:01:04.659> go<00:01:04.869> to<00:01:04.930> the<00:01:05.229> frame<00:01:05.470> this<00:01:05.710> statistic

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.960 
you where that bolt is this bracket here
is<00:01:11.830> going<00:01:12.009> to<00:01:12.070> go<00:01:12.189> through<00:01:12.369> this<00:01:12.520> little<00:01:12.759> spot

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
is going to go through this little spot

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.940 
is going to go through this little spot
we've<00:01:13.240> already<00:01:13.360> notched<00:01:13.630> it<00:01:13.930> out<00:01:14.079> on<00:01:14.710> the

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
we've already notched it out on the

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 
other side you can see where the plastic

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:20.280 
other side you can see where the plastic
is<00:01:18.549> still<00:01:18.640> intact<00:01:19.090> we<00:01:19.360> have<00:01:19.509> it<00:01:19.630> not<00:01:19.869> just<00:01:20.110> so

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
is still intact we have it not just so

is still intact we have it not just so
you<00:01:20.320> can<00:01:20.530> see<00:01:20.710> what<00:01:20.860> its<00:01:20.950> gonna<00:01:21.040> look<00:01:21.159> like

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
you can see what its gonna look like

you can see what its gonna look like
we're<00:01:21.610> gonna<00:01:21.670> split<00:01:22.060> we<00:01:22.600> chose<00:01:22.960> to<00:01:23.770> go<00:01:23.920> to<00:01:23.950> the

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
we're gonna split we chose to go to the

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.789 
we're gonna split we chose to go to the
end<00:01:24.400> of<00:01:24.520> that<00:01:24.640> little<00:01:24.790> rib<00:01:25.090> right<00:01:25.360> there

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
end of that little rib right there

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.170 
end of that little rib right there
you're<00:01:26.799> gonna<00:01:26.890> see<00:01:27.040> the<00:01:27.340> bracket<00:01:27.759> doesn't<00:01:28.090> go

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
you're gonna see the bracket doesn't go

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.819 
you're gonna see the bracket doesn't go
all<00:01:28.360> that<00:01:28.570> way<00:01:28.720> we<00:01:28.960> just<00:01:28.990> chose<00:01:29.350> we<00:01:29.619> thought

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:29.829 
all that way we just chose we thought

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:31.289 
all that way we just chose we thought
that<00:01:30.040> looked<00:01:30.220> the<00:01:30.280> best<00:01:30.340> and<00:01:30.670> we<00:01:30.820> have<00:01:31.000> to<00:01:31.119> cut

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
that looked the best and we have to cut

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:33.420 
that looked the best and we have to cut
that<00:01:31.479> out<00:01:31.540> let's<00:01:32.140> you<00:01:32.290> see<00:01:32.530> on<00:01:32.800> the<00:01:32.950> other<00:01:33.100> side

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
that out let's you see on the other side

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.580 
that out let's you see on the other side
we've<00:01:33.790> cut<00:01:34.000> that<00:01:34.030> little<00:01:34.420> bit<00:01:34.570> about<00:01:34.750> we<00:01:35.350> just

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
we've cut that little bit about we just

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:36.660 
we've cut that little bit about we just
made<00:01:35.770> one<00:01:35.979> of<00:01:36.040> those

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
made one of those

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.359 
made one of those
right<00:01:36.790> there<00:01:37.060> your<00:01:37.689> brackets<00:01:38.200> gonna<00:01:38.439> do<00:01:38.650> and

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
right there your brackets gonna do and

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.370 
right there your brackets gonna do and
there<00:01:39.580> has<00:01:39.790> to<00:01:39.820> be<00:01:40.000> such<00:01:42.360> top<00:01:43.360> bolt<00:01:43.840> there's

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
there has to be such top bolt there's

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.410 
there has to be such top bolt there's
three<00:01:44.710> bolts<00:01:44.950> in<00:01:45.369> line<00:01:45.670> with<00:01:45.880> each<00:01:46.000> other<00:01:46.210> on

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
three bolts in line with each other on

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.780 
three bolts in line with each other on
the<00:01:46.450> frame<00:01:46.780> with<00:01:46.990> that<00:01:47.110> crash<00:01:47.380> bar<00:01:47.790> attaches

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
the frame with that crash bar attaches

you<00:03:56.390> how<00:03:56.600> to<00:03:56.660> hang<00:03:56.960> the<00:03:57.170> bargain<00:03:58.100> get<00:03:58.670> it<00:03:58.790> all

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
you how to hang the bargain get it all

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.590 
you how to hang the bargain get it all
situated<00:04:00.310> we've<00:04:01.310> got<00:04:01.430> the<00:04:01.550> brackets<00:04:02.000> tight<00:04:02.330> at

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
situated we've got the brackets tight at

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.750 
situated we've got the brackets tight at
the<00:04:02.690> bottom<00:04:03.080> we<00:04:03.380> did<00:04:03.560> say<00:04:03.770> just<00:04:04.280> go<00:04:04.460> ahead<00:04:04.550> and

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
the bottom we did say just go ahead and

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.720 
the bottom we did say just go ahead and
tighten<00:04:05.270> one<00:04:05.480> and<00:04:05.690> then<00:04:05.780> you<00:04:05.900> can<00:04:06.050> rotate<00:04:06.230> them

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
tighten one and then you can rotate them

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.770 
tighten one and then you can rotate them
once<00:04:07.730> you<00:04:07.850> got<00:04:07.970> the<00:04:08.090> garden<00:04:08.390> mounted<00:04:08.660> but

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
once you got the garden mounted but

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:09.700 
once you got the garden mounted but
we're<00:04:08.960> going<00:04:09.050> to<00:04:09.140> show<00:04:09.230> you<00:04:09.290> another<00:04:09.560> little

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:09.710 
we're going to show you another little

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.400 
we're going to show you another little
trick<00:04:10.190> to<00:04:10.340> is<00:04:11.090> what<00:04:11.300> with<00:04:11.780> two<00:04:11.960> bolts<00:04:12.320> in

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
trick to is what with two bolts in

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.380 
trick to is what with two bolts in
they're<00:04:12.590> only<00:04:13.190> doing<00:04:13.490> one<00:04:13.700> you<00:04:13.910> can<00:04:14.060> sit<00:04:14.240> there

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
they're only doing one you can sit there

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:15.790 
they're only doing one you can sit there
and<00:04:14.450> pivot<00:04:14.780> that<00:04:14.960> thing<00:04:15.230> but<00:04:15.410> that's<00:04:15.560> what<00:04:15.710> you

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
and pivot that thing but that's what you

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.920 
and pivot that thing but that's what you
want<00:04:15.980> to<00:04:16.040> do<00:04:16.130> it<00:04:16.250> first<00:04:16.519> you<00:04:17.120> put<00:04:17.330> a<00:04:17.360> level<00:04:17.780> up

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
want to do it first you put a level up

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.170 
want to do it first you put a level up
there<00:04:18.200> you<00:04:18.799> can<00:04:18.980> make<00:04:19.130> sure<00:04:19.160> that<00:04:19.400> these<00:04:19.730> these

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
there you can make sure that these these

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.090 
there you can make sure that these these
plates<00:04:20.540> are<00:04:20.720> square<00:04:21.110> you<00:04:21.709> know<00:04:21.830> if<00:04:21.920> they<00:04:22.040> were

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
plates are square you know if they were

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.740 
plates are square you know if they were
in<00:04:22.310> you'd<00:04:22.520> see<00:04:22.700> a<00:04:22.730> gap<00:04:22.970> right<00:04:23.210> there<00:04:23.270> so<00:04:23.570> what

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
in you'd see a gap right there so what

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.050 
in you'd see a gap right there so what
we<00:04:23.840> did<00:04:23.990> is<00:04:24.170> we<00:04:24.340> pivoted<00:04:25.340> them<00:04:25.490> around<00:04:25.730> until

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
we did is we pivoted them around until

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.550 
we did is we pivoted them around until
it<00:04:26.210> was<00:04:26.300> flat<00:04:26.570> all<00:04:26.780> the<00:04:26.810> way<00:04:26.990> across<00:04:27.230> the

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
it was flat all the way across the

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.410 
it was flat all the way across the
bracket<00:04:27.920> the<00:04:28.010> bracket<00:04:28.040> then<00:04:28.850> we<00:04:29.090> went<00:04:29.330> ahead

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
bracket the bracket then we went ahead

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:30.640 
bracket the bracket then we went ahead
and<00:04:29.750> tighten<00:04:30.050> the<00:04:30.170> other<00:04:30.200> Pole

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
and tighten the other Pole

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.350 
and tighten the other Pole
so<00:04:30.740> these<00:04:30.860> bolt<00:04:31.190> brackets<00:04:31.790> are<00:04:31.910> tight<00:04:32.150> right

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
so these bolt brackets are tight right

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.760 
so these bolt brackets are tight right
there<00:04:32.390> so<00:04:32.720> you<00:04:32.750> knew<00:04:32.990> it<00:04:33.080> either<00:04:33.200> way<00:04:33.440> you<00:04:33.500> just

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
there so you knew it either way you just

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:34.960 
there so you knew it either way you just
tighten<00:04:33.950> one<00:04:34.220> and<00:04:34.400> once<00:04:34.520> you<00:04:34.610> get<00:04:34.730> it<00:04:34.850> both

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
tighten one and once you get it both

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.120 
tighten one and once you get it both
with<00:04:35.150> the<00:04:35.300> guard<00:04:35.540> will<00:04:36.230> square<00:04:36.470> themselves<00:04:36.980> up

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
with the guard will square themselves up

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.410 
with the guard will square themselves up
then<00:04:37.310> you<00:04:37.400> can<00:04:37.430> finish<00:04:37.700> tightening<00:04:38.000> or<00:04:38.330> you

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420 
then you can finish tightening or you

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:39.730 
then you can finish tightening or you
can<00:04:38.570> do<00:04:38.630> at<00:04:38.750> this<00:04:38.870> point<00:04:39.110> just<00:04:39.230> get<00:04:39.410> it<00:04:39.560> out<00:04:39.710> of

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
can do at this point just get it out of

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.040 
can do at this point just get it out of
the<00:04:39.860> way<00:04:40.010> that's<00:04:40.700> what<00:04:40.880> we<00:04:41.000> did<00:04:41.180> right<00:04:41.420> here<00:04:41.720> so

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
the way that's what we did right here so

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.180 
the way that's what we did right here so
these<00:04:42.470> bones<00:04:42.770> these<00:04:43.280> brackets<00:04:43.550> are<00:04:43.820> tight<00:04:44.060> the

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
these bones these brackets are tight the

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.730 
these bones these brackets are tight the
top<00:04:46.190> ones<00:04:46.460> here<00:04:46.700> are<00:04:46.880> loose<00:04:47.120> right<00:04:47.390> now<00:04:47.740> we're

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
top ones here are loose right now we're

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.170 
top ones here are loose right now we're
not<00:04:48.770> going<00:04:49.040> to<00:04:49.070> do<00:04:49.250> them<00:04:49.430> until<00:04:49.850> we<00:04:49.970> get<00:04:50.090> them

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
not going to do them until we get them

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:51.850 
not going to do them until we get them
connected<00:04:50.480> to<00:04:50.780> the<00:04:50.900> guard<00:04:51.140> we<00:04:51.350> just<00:04:51.530> have<00:04:51.680> them

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
connected to the guard we just have them

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:57.040 
connected to the guard we just have them
loose<00:04:52.450> these<00:04:53.450> bottom<00:04:53.960> brackets<00:04:55.450> mount<00:04:56.450> to

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
loose these bottom brackets mount to
