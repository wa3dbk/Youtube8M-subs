true<00:00:28.619> match<00:00:28.830> with<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.160> pump<00:00:29.550> on<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.390> it<00:00:30.630> was

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
true match with a pump on it and it was

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.840 
true match with a pump on it and it was
like<00:00:30.750> eleven<00:00:31.560> or<00:00:31.710> twelve<00:00:31.890> dollars<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.640> I

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
like eleven or twelve dollars and I

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.729 
like eleven or twelve dollars and I
believe<00:00:33.329> correct<00:00:33.809> me<00:00:33.989> if<00:00:34.079> I'm<00:00:34.230> wrong<00:00:34.260> but<00:00:34.620> I

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
believe correct me if I'm wrong but I

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.160 
believe correct me if I'm wrong but I
think<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:35.219> only<00:00:35.370> difference<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:36.030> that<00:00:36.329> one

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
think the only difference is that one

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.430 
think the only difference is that one
has<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.410> pump<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.010> one<00:00:38.280> doesn't<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:39.210> I'm<00:00:40.020> not

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
has a pump and one doesn't so I'm not

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.470 
has a pump and one doesn't so I'm not
quite<00:00:40.770> sure<00:00:40.920> if<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.670> pump<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.059> worth<00:00:42.270> the

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
quite sure if the pump is worth the

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.100 
quite sure if the pump is worth the
extra<00:00:42.629> money

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
extra money

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.110 
extra money
I<00:00:43.260> don't<00:00:43.770> know<00:00:43.829> I<00:00:43.860> mean<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.250> is<00:00:44.460> nice<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.789> have<00:00:45.059> a

throw a pump on this thing instead of

a good quality drugstore foundation I

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.860 
a good quality drugstore foundation I
think<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.430> is<00:00:59.579> super<00:00:59.850> comparable<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.780> the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
think this is super comparable to the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.049 
think this is super comparable to the
Revlon<00:01:01.260> Colorstay<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:02.100> find<00:01:02.489> them<00:01:02.760> very

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
Revlon Colorstay I find them very

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.200

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
coverage it has more of a heavy coverage

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.300 
coverage it has more of a heavy coverage

heavy<00:01:11.549> but<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.420> gives<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.810> good<00:01:13.140> amount

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
heavy but it it gives you a good amount

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.100 
heavy but it it gives you a good amount
of<00:01:13.650> coverage<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:14.549> lasts<00:01:14.909> all<00:01:15.240> day<00:01:15.360> without

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110

I've been doing a lot of reviews on BB

creams so make sure to check those out

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.859

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.389 
and yeah let me know if you've tried
this<00:01:42.930> out<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.560> what<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.829> think<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.250> and

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
this out and what you think of it and

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.499 
this out and what you think of it and
let<00:01:44.610> me<00:01:44.640> know<00:01:44.850> if<00:01:44.970> there's<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.240> difference

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
let me know if there's a difference

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.539 
let me know if there's a difference
between<00:01:45.869> this<00:01:46.259> one<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.829> pump<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.220> think

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
between this one and the pump I think

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.859 
between this one and the pump I think
the<00:01:47.670> only<00:01:47.790> difference<00:01:47.909> is<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.390> pump<00:01:48.600> that's

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
the only difference is the pump that's

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.870 
the only difference is the pump that's
my<00:01:49.290> thoughts<00:01:49.530> I<00:01:49.770> was<00:01:49.890> like<00:01:50.070> looking<00:01:50.549> at<00:01:50.729> the

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
my thoughts I was like looking at the

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.030 
my thoughts I was like looking at the
signs<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.659> was<00:01:51.810> like<00:01:52.020> I'm<00:01:52.560> pretty<00:01:52.770> sure

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
signs and I was like I'm pretty sure

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.090 
signs and I was like I'm pretty sure
these<00:01:53.220> are<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.430> same<00:01:53.729> thing<00:01:54.060> so<00:01:54.600> I'm<00:01:54.930> not<00:01:55.200> 100%

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
these are the same thing so I'm not 100%

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.830 
these are the same thing so I'm not 100%
sure<00:01:56.130> but<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.520> think<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.509> case

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
sure but I think that is the case

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.840 
sure but I think that is the case
anyways<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.950> will<00:01:59.009> see<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.369> guys<00:01:59.490> next<00:01:59.670> time
