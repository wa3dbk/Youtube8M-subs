when there are some chunks in it so I

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.830 
when there are some chunks in it so I
did<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.309> as<00:00:53.460> fun<00:00:53.730> as<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:54.030> could<00:00:54.239> but<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.570> mean

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
did it as fun as I could but I mean

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.490 
did it as fun as I could but I mean
maybe<00:00:55.559> 30<00:00:56.160> seconds<00:00:56.730> not<00:00:57.030> very<00:00:57.390> long<00:00:57.690> so<00:00:58.320> as<00:00:58.469> you

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
maybe 30 seconds not very long so as you

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.349 
maybe 30 seconds not very long so as you
can<00:00:58.770> see<00:00:58.949> here<00:00:59.250> um<00:00:59.489> there<00:00:59.820> are<00:00:59.940> some<00:01:00.180> like

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
can see here um there are some like

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.540 
can see here um there are some like
bigger<00:01:00.629> chunks<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.379> but<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:01.829> mean<00:01:02.250> they're

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
bigger chunks in it but I mean they're

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.189 
bigger chunks in it but I mean they're
not<00:01:02.699> all<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.030> big<00:01:03.449> that's<00:01:03.719> not<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.989> end<00:01:04.140> of

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
not all that big that's not the end of

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.850 
not all that big that's not the end of
the<00:01:04.290> world<00:01:04.610> once<00:01:05.610> that's<00:01:05.880> done<00:01:06.350> I'm<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.409> next

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
the world once that's done I'm the next

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.230 
the world once that's done I'm the next
step<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.220> measure<00:01:08.520> out<00:01:08.760> your<00:01:08.790> peanut

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
step is to measure out your peanut

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.289 
step is to measure out your peanut
butter<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.890> what<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:10.920> suggest<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.790> using<00:01:12.240> a

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
butter and what I suggest is using a

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.620 
butter and what I suggest is using a
spatula<00:01:12.540> um<00:01:13.340> so<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.820> can<00:01:15.000> like<00:01:15.150> smooth

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
spatula um so that you can like smooth

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.420 
spatula um so that you can like smooth
it<00:01:15.869> out<00:01:16.049> when<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.530> put<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.830> in<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.340> then

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
it out when you put it in and then

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.999 
it out when you put it in and then
tapping<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.150> on<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:19.049> surface<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:19.979> that

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
tapping it on the surface so that

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.520 
tapping it on the surface so that
there's<00:01:20.970> no<00:01:21.060> air<00:01:21.390> bubbles<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.110> know<00:01:22.259> how

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
there's no air bubbles and you know how

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.660 
there's no air bubbles and you know how
much<00:01:22.740> clean<00:01:22.979> if<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.220> think<00:01:23.369> you're<00:01:23.460> actually

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
much clean if I think you're actually

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.630 
much clean if I think you're actually
using<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.600> then<00:01:25.049> just<00:01:25.350> go<00:01:25.590> ahead<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.950> scoop

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
using and then just go ahead and scoop

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.210 
using and then just go ahead and scoop
that<00:01:26.880> into<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.630> graham<00:01:28.320> cracker<00:01:28.590> crumbs<00:01:28.920> and

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
that into the graham cracker crumbs and

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.980 
that into the graham cracker crumbs and
mix<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.610> all<00:01:29.759> around<00:01:29.790> what's<00:01:30.689> great<00:01:30.840> about

for<00:02:06.390> about<00:02:06.600> 15<00:02:07.200> minutes<00:02:07.409> just<00:02:08.129> so<00:02:08.220> that<00:02:08.369> they

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
for about 15 minutes just so that they

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.760 
for about 15 minutes just so that they
get<00:02:08.610> really<00:02:08.819> hard<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.479> then<00:02:09.989> you'll<00:02:10.530> want<00:02:10.590> to

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
get really hard and then you'll want to

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.170 
get really hard and then you'll want to
melt<00:02:10.979> your<00:02:11.099> chocolate<00:02:11.160> now<00:02:11.730> we<00:02:11.790> don't<00:02:11.970> have<00:02:12.150> a

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
microwave or anything

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.080 
microwave or anything
so<00:02:13.409> I<00:02:13.439> just<00:02:13.890> actually<00:02:14.189> put<00:02:14.579> a<00:02:14.610> big<00:02:14.819> pot<00:02:14.849> of

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090

water<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.480> boil<00:02:15.870> put<00:02:16.680> a<00:02:16.739> metal<00:02:17.040> um<00:02:17.569> bowl<00:02:18.569> on<00:02:18.870> top

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
water to boil put a metal um bowl on top

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.929 
water to boil put a metal um bowl on top
and<00:02:19.379> then<00:02:19.560> I<00:02:19.590> put<00:02:19.859> the<00:02:19.980> chocolate<00:02:20.159> inside<00:02:20.730> of

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:20.939 
and then I put the chocolate inside of

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:23.119 
and then I put the chocolate inside of
that<00:02:21.060> and<00:02:21.299> heat<00:02:21.840> melt<00:02:22.109> it<00:02:22.349> like<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:22.739> steam<00:02:22.950> and

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
that and heat melt it like to steam and

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.459 
that and heat melt it like to steam and
it<00:02:23.219> makes<00:02:23.370> it<00:02:23.549> really<00:02:23.730> runny<00:02:24.120> so<00:02:25.049> then<00:02:25.200> what

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:25.469 
it makes it really runny so then what

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:27.140 
it makes it really runny so then what
you<00:02:25.560> want<00:02:25.769> to<00:02:25.859> do<00:02:26.040> is<00:02:26.280> take<00:02:26.579> your<00:02:26.790> peanut

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:28.859 
butter balls because else they should be

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:30.910 
butter balls because else they should be
really<00:02:29.129> hard<00:02:29.400> because<00:02:29.700> they're<00:02:29.939> cold<00:02:30.239> right

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
really hard because they're cold right

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.220 
really hard because they're cold right
and<00:02:31.920> dip<00:02:32.400> them<00:02:32.609> into<00:02:32.849> the<00:02:33.150> chocolate<00:02:33.599> and<00:02:33.870> then

let the extra drip off and then put them
back<00:02:36.209> onto<00:02:36.689> the<00:02:36.989> paper<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.560> I<00:02:38.340> just<00:02:38.609> use<00:02:38.760> a

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
back onto the paper and I just use a

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.429 
back onto the paper and I just use a
toothpick<00:02:39.120> for<00:02:39.510> this<00:02:39.629> so<00:02:39.780> that<00:02:39.930> my<00:02:40.049> hands<00:02:40.319> will

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:40.439 
toothpick for this so that my hands will

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:42.709 
toothpick for this so that my hands will
get<00:02:40.560> all<00:02:40.799> nasty<00:02:41.040> and<00:02:41.340> it's<00:02:42.030> really<00:02:42.540> the

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:42.719 
get all nasty and it's really the

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:45.379 
get all nasty and it's really the
easiest<00:02:42.870> way<00:02:43.829> that<00:02:44.069> I<00:02:44.189> found<00:02:44.489> to<00:02:44.730> do<00:02:44.879> this<00:02:45.090> and

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:45.389 
easiest way that I found to do this and

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:47.690 
easiest way that I found to do this and
it<00:02:45.510> works<00:02:45.689> really<00:02:46.019> well<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.739> then<00:02:47.340> once

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
it works really well and then once

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.220 
it works really well and then once
you've<00:02:47.939> dipped<00:02:48.239> all<00:02:48.510> of<00:02:48.780> your<00:02:48.930> peanut<00:02:49.200> butter
