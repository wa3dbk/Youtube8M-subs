00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
good build path not only does it built

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.790 
good build path not only does it built
from<00:00:18.300> hunter's<00:00:18.600> machete<00:00:18.750> but<00:00:19.470> it<00:00:19.590> also

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
from hunter's machete but it also

meaning that you can build it slowly up

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.540 
meaning that you can build it slowly up
over<00:00:24.420> time<00:00:24.689> rather<00:00:25.260> than<00:00:25.590> having<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:26.010> save<00:00:26.279> for

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550

a<00:00:26.580> huge<00:00:26.939> chunk<00:00:27.240> of<00:00:27.390> gold<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:28.019> in<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.500> end<00:00:28.740> it

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
a huge chunk of gold and in the end it

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.400 
a huge chunk of gold and in the end it
still<00:00:29.099> only<00:00:29.369> cost<00:00:29.730> 1650<00:00:30.660> gold<00:00:30.869> which<00:00:31.289> is

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
still only cost 1650 gold which is

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.950 
still only cost 1650 gold which is
incredibly<00:00:32.250> cheap<00:00:32.579> in<00:00:33.329> addition<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.809> that

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
incredibly cheap in addition to that

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.170 
incredibly cheap in addition to that
it's<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.469> jungle<00:00:34.770> item<00:00:35.070> so<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.430> gold<00:00:35.700> bonus<00:00:36.030> it

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
it's a jungle item so the gold bonus it

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.209 
it's a jungle item so the gold bonus it
gives<00:00:36.390> can<00:00:36.809> be<00:00:36.899> fairly<00:00:37.290> valuable<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.920> often

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
gives can be fairly valuable and often

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.040 
gives can be fairly valuable and often
give<00:00:38.370> up<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.579> 500<00:00:39.120> or<00:00:39.210> more<00:00:39.390> gold<00:00:39.629> per<00:00:39.840> game

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
give up to 500 or more gold per game

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.990 
give up to 500 or more gold per game
depending<00:00:40.739> on<00:00:40.860> how<00:00:41.010> much<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.280> end<00:00:41.430> up<00:00:41.579> farming

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
depending on how much you end up farming

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.569 
depending on how much you end up farming
in<00:00:42.930> addition<00:00:43.379> it's<00:00:43.559> also<00:00:43.860> very<00:00:44.280> gold

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
in addition it's also very gold

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.549 
in addition it's also very gold
efficient<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:45.960> efficient<00:00:46.440> without

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
efficient it is that efficient without

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.770 
efficient it is that efficient without
the<00:00:46.860> passives<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.430> actives<00:00:47.610> which<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.480> really

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
the passives and actives which is really

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.020 
the passives and actives which is really
good<00:00:49.020> since<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.559> actives<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.070> passives<00:00:50.579> can

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
good since the actives and passives can

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.729 
good since the actives and passives can
more<00:00:51.300> than<00:00:51.329> double<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.960> gold<00:00:52.140> value<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.649> the

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
more than double the gold value of the

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.490 
more than double the gold value of the
item<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.399> quite<00:00:54.180> realistically<00:00:54.899> pay<00:00:55.289> for

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
item and quite realistically pay for

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.439 
item and quite realistically pay for
itself<00:00:55.770> due<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.250> bonus<00:00:56.610> gold<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.270> use

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449
