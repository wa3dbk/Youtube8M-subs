my goodness look at how huge this thing
is<00:00:16.529> just<00:00:16.740> so<00:00:17.340> you<00:00:17.460> can<00:00:17.550> have<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.730> size

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
is just so you can have a size

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.200 
is just so you can have a size
comparison<00:00:18.500> what<00:00:19.500> this<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:19.920> for<00:00:20.189> its<00:00:20.340> being<00:00:20.609> 64

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
comparison what this is for its being 64

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.540 
comparison what this is for its being 64
arcade<00:00:22.109> stick<00:00:22.410> not<00:00:22.830> that<00:00:23.010> there<00:00:23.189> was<00:00:23.310> many

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
worked pretty good i didn't think it

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.399 
worked pretty good i didn't think it
would<00:01:24.000> work<00:01:24.030> well<00:01:24.420> bein<00:01:24.689> us<00:01:24.869> this<00:01:25.049> isn't

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
would work well bein us this isn't

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.560 
would work well bein us this isn't
arcade<00:01:25.830> stick<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.520> here's<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.030> start<00:01:27.299> but<00:01:27.450> i

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
arcade stick and here's to start but i

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.690

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
didn't show that anyways I didn't think

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.190 
didn't show that anyways I didn't think
it<00:01:29.880> would<00:01:29.970> be<00:01:30.119> good<00:01:30.329> because<00:01:30.600> as<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:30.900> was<00:01:31.110> an

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
it would be good because as it was an

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.330 
it would be good because as it was an
arcade<00:01:31.560> stick<00:01:31.829> but<00:01:31.979> actually<00:01:33.380> Mario<00:01:34.380> 64<00:01:34.799> was

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
arcade stick but actually Mario 64 was

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.179 
arcade stick but actually Mario 64 was
actually<00:01:35.790> quite<00:01:36.030> decent<00:01:36.810> with<00:01:37.650> this<00:01:37.890> it

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
actually quite decent with this it

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.819 
actually quite decent with this it
actually<00:01:38.460> felt<00:01:38.939> better<00:01:39.180> than<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.829> controller

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
actually felt better than the controller

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.550 
actually felt better than the controller
could<00:01:41.070> be<00:01:41.250> so<00:01:41.579> it's<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.850> command<00:01:42.409> it's<00:01:43.409> at

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
could be so it's the command it's at

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.670 
could be so it's the command it's at
least<00:01:43.799> half<00:01:44.040> way<00:01:44.070> better<00:01:44.549> if<00:01:45.479> not<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:46.110> whole<00:01:46.470> lot

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
least half way better if not a whole lot

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.469 
least half way better if not a whole lot
there<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.070> was<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.820> was<00:01:48.000> more<00:01:48.210> than<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.450> expected

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
there it was it was more than I expected

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.510 
there it was it was more than I expected
so<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.170> haven't<00:01:49.500> touched<00:01:49.680> this<00:01:49.799> out<00:01:50.070> with<00:01:50.250> too

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
so I haven't touched this out with too

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.670 
so I haven't touched this out with too
many<00:01:50.670> games<00:01:50.939> there's<00:01:51.930> only<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.290> many<00:01:52.380> games
