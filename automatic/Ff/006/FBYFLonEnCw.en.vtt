00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.940
 Yes Leon channel I introduced this is this Kamen Rider Drive 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.870
 It is a shift car set 01 if it is a gift car series of a major role as early as Carn. 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.429
 Set came out 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:18.750
 3 or I different from the sports car type that came with it and have a belt in the first set 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.289
 Of course, the audio is linked but what kind of movie is displayed on the display 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.020
 Or 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.350
 Immediately 0 minutes in 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.350
 To do 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.970
 Yes the contents are powdered and shift mother is in 3 cars From the left Justice Hunter Massive 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.449
 monster 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:38.850
 It is a spin mixer Which shift or color scheme 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:43.650
 I difference this design is more than train series in a quite unique and will clearly 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:47.760
 But there is a slight difference in scale, but almost all are the same 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:52.770
 Well, after the whole photo Santer is has become something like 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.400
 I try to write police in the form of police cars, but the float part looks a bit like a jail 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.480
 It becomes 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:01:01.800
 It is this run with transformation to the shift state even if you exceed you 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.640
 Justice hunter becomes police badge mark Next Masuo monster 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.820
 This is a whole body clear part 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:11.200
 The color of purple and green is quite spring 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.729
 The window is the face of a monster from the front part and it's a sticker here too 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.680
 It seems that without 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.610
 The size of the tire is also good Font shift mother has a great composition for each type behind 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.910
 Is Corde 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.630
 Gimmick is a bad turn and this run 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:27.979
 And here is a monster mark 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:35.090
 The third ski mixer This is it has become the base worker Datte other land 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:40.460
 As a whole is a front side has come out and atmosphere in perfectly tire is six people has become something like the back side 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:43.650
 What's a bit unusual is that usually the rear wheel turns and the mark comes out 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.680
 This spin mixer is not for the advent but for everyone 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:49.890
 The mark appears when the part is rotated 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.659
 But as the car of such'm here it is before 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:58.789
 When using it as a shift state, the back side is front 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:00.940
 It feels like this, but all jobs run very smoothly but after all Marsh 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:06.650
 Monsters are amazing 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:11.350
 There is power in the second half and such a direction that the police chases is also possible 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.350

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:40.880
 It was ear exchange that we skipped reply for a sudden response 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.880
 And the display was the same as the mark here Shift up 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.560
 Further acceleration 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.580

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.320
 You feel quite different from anything you think 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.320
 Shift up 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.910

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.889
 tiff tap 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.160
 pa 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.880

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.639
 Ah ah ah 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:53.430

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:32.180
 Yes I confirmed the voice with all three cars now, but with tire replacement and shift-up individual voices 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:36.060
 It comes out, but full throttle was common to voice 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:39.480
 It 's a good feeling that you will get a separate error each time you investigate 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:44.430
 We introduced deluxe shift car set 01 in ruins 

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:45.840
 Each is different at all properly then you hear the individual visits to each type also design of each vehicle 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:49.590
 It was quite good 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:53.900
 Personally I like the massive monsters more shift car series 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:53.900
 It was introduction of deluxe shift car set 01 

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.460
 Ah ah ah ah
