over<00:01:58.399> here<00:01:58.579> Chuck<00:01:58.880> huh<00:01:59.539> how's<00:01:59.899> it<00:02:00.049> looking

00:02:00.309 --> 00:02:00.319 
over here Chuck huh how's it looking

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:02.499 
over here Chuck huh how's it looking
pretty<00:02:00.500> good<00:02:01.429> I<00:02:01.700> think<00:02:02.000> we're<00:02:02.209> gonna<00:02:02.299> have<00:02:02.390> to

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
pretty good I think we're gonna have to

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.090 
pretty good I think we're gonna have to
drill<00:02:02.689> two<00:02:02.869> holes<00:02:02.899> oh<00:02:04.420> one<00:02:05.439> well<00:02:06.439> either<00:02:06.770> that

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
drill two holes oh one well either that

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.869 
drill two holes oh one well either that
or<00:02:07.810> maybe<00:02:08.810> three<00:02:09.200> two<00:02:09.769> farther<00:02:10.069> back<00:02:10.369> and<00:02:10.700> one

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 
or maybe three two farther back and one

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:15.009 
or maybe three two farther back and one
for<00:02:11.120> the<00:02:11.209> thing<00:02:11.420> or<00:02:11.690> just<00:02:12.620> move<00:02:12.860> one<00:02:13.129> back<00:02:14.019> well

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
for the thing or just move one back well

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.229 
for the thing or just move one back well
I<00:02:15.319> mean<00:02:15.620> that<00:02:15.739> makes<00:02:15.890> sense<00:02:16.099> I<00:02:16.549> have<00:02:16.819> one<00:02:17.030> for

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
I mean that makes sense I have one for

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:18.970 
I mean that makes sense I have one for
the<00:02:17.299> corner<00:02:17.660> yeah<00:02:18.110> and<00:02:18.319> then<00:02:18.470> two<00:02:18.709> for

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
the corner yeah and then two for

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.490 
the corner yeah and then two for
mounting<00:02:19.340> yeah<00:02:20.500> so<00:02:21.500> here<00:02:22.069> is<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:23.260> piece<00:02:24.260> with

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
mounting yeah so here is the piece with

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.130 
mounting yeah so here is the piece with
the<00:02:24.530> jb<00:02:24.920> weld<00:02:25.130> it<00:02:26.090> set<00:02:26.360> up<00:02:26.480> overnight<00:02:26.900> with<00:02:27.110> a

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
the jb weld it set up overnight with a

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.000 
the jb weld it set up overnight with a
light<00:02:27.410> on<00:02:27.440> it<00:02:28.030> nice<00:02:29.030> and<00:02:29.299> solid<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:30.470> plan<00:02:30.739> is

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
light on it nice and solid the plan is

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.190 
light on it nice and solid the plan is
to<00:02:31.040> get<00:02:31.940> something<00:02:32.209> along<00:02:32.569> the<00:02:32.690> lines<00:02:32.900> of<00:02:33.079> this

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
to get something along the lines of this

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.759 
to get something along the lines of this
with<00:02:33.500> this<00:02:34.360> metal<00:02:35.360> piece<00:02:35.599> acting<00:02:36.260> as<00:02:36.379> a<00:02:36.410> brace

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
with this metal piece acting as a brace

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.470 
with this metal piece acting as a brace
and<00:02:37.750> then<00:02:39.549> I'll<00:02:40.549> grab<00:02:40.819> this<00:02:40.970> right<00:02:41.180> here<00:02:41.390> to

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
and then I'll grab this right here to

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.600 
and then I'll grab this right here to
show<00:02:41.540> you<00:02:41.750> this<00:02:42.379> is<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:42.739> same<00:02:42.980> diameter<00:02:43.370> as

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
show you this is the same diameter as

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.640 
show you this is the same diameter as
one<00:02:44.269> in<00:02:44.360> the<00:02:44.390> bottom<00:02:44.599> so<00:02:44.959> we<00:02:45.079> have<00:02:45.260> this<00:02:45.440> as<00:02:45.620> a

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
one in the bottom so we have this as a

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.009 
one in the bottom so we have this as a
reference<00:02:46.099> this<00:02:46.250> is<00:02:46.400> the<00:02:46.489> one<00:02:46.670> that<00:02:47.599> goes<00:02:47.840> in

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
reference this is the one that goes in

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:53.620 
reference this is the one that goes in
the<00:02:48.110> top<00:02:48.319> to<00:02:48.620> hold<00:02:48.769> it<00:02:48.980> on<00:02:50.350> so<00:02:52.510> we're<00:02:53.510> thinking

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
the top to hold it on so we're thinking

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.800 
the top to hold it on so we're thinking
something<00:02:55.030> like<00:02:56.030> that<00:02:56.269> obviously<00:02:56.450> it<00:02:56.750> needs

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
something like that obviously it needs

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.740 
something like that obviously it needs
to<00:02:56.989> be<00:02:57.109> cut<00:02:57.560> down<00:02:57.769> a<00:02:57.799> little<00:02:58.010> bit<00:02:58.220> more<00:02:58.750> two

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
to be cut down a little bit more two

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.180 
to be cut down a little bit more two
mounting<00:03:00.139> screws<00:03:00.200> over<00:03:00.739> here<00:03:01.040> and<00:03:01.389> then

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
mounting screws over here and then

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.710 
mounting screws over here and then
that'll<00:03:04.190> be<00:03:04.220> lined<00:03:04.609> up<00:03:04.819> right<00:03:05.299> along<00:03:05.540> with

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
that'll be lined up right along with

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.699 
that'll be lined up right along with
that<00:03:05.780> so<00:03:06.530> whenever<00:03:07.489> it<00:03:07.700> does<00:03:07.849> slide<00:03:08.180> back<00:03:08.510> on

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
that so whenever it does slide back on

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.589 
that so whenever it does slide back on
hopefully<00:03:09.709> doesn't<00:03:09.920> break<00:03:10.250> in<00:03:10.430> this<00:03:10.579> piece<00:03:11.569> of

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
hopefully doesn't break in this piece of

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.879 
hopefully doesn't break in this piece of
crap<00:03:12.019> norcold<00:03:12.799> fridge<00:03:13.010> door<00:03:13.810> will<00:03:14.889> actually

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:15.889 
crap norcold fridge door will actually

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:19.479 
crap norcold fridge door will actually
stay<00:03:16.130> on<00:03:16.160> right<00:03:16.819> at<00:03:17.000> 1/4<00:03:17.299> that<00:03:17.630> way<00:03:18.310> but<00:03:19.310> that's

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
stay on right at 1/4 that way but that's

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.460 
stay on right at 1/4 that way but that's
not<00:03:19.700> from<00:03:19.849> the<00:03:19.910> outside<00:03:20.030> so<00:03:20.720> if<00:03:20.780> we<00:03:20.930> go<00:03:21.109> just<00:03:21.380> a

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
not from the outside so if we go just a

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.129 
not from the outside so if we go just a
hair<00:03:21.680> more<00:03:21.859> than<00:03:22.040> 1/4<00:03:22.310> both<00:03:22.639> ways<00:03:22.930> it<00:03:23.930> should

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:24.139 
hair more than 1/4 both ways it should

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:29.229 
hair more than 1/4 both ways it should
do<00:03:24.349> it<00:03:25.030> here's<00:03:26.030> the<00:03:26.329> plate<00:03:26.630> we<00:03:27.319> have<00:03:27.349> the<00:03:28.239> hole

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
do it here's the plate we have the hole

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.490 
do it here's the plate we have the hole
drilled<00:03:29.569> right<00:03:29.930> here<00:03:30.440> and<00:03:31.250> then<00:03:31.519> we're<00:03:31.819> gonna

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
drilled right here and then we're gonna

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.440 
drilled right here and then we're gonna
drill<00:03:33.500> a<00:03:33.530> couple<00:03:33.650> more<00:03:33.980> holes<00:03:34.340> here<00:03:34.910> and

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
drill a couple more holes here and

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:36.580 
drill a couple more holes here and
that's<00:03:35.599> where<00:03:35.810> we're<00:03:35.959> gonna<00:03:36.049> mount<00:03:36.319> the

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
that's where we're gonna mount the

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.710 
that's where we're gonna mount the
screws<00:03:36.919> in<00:03:37.190> you<00:03:37.519> have<00:03:37.639> these<00:03:37.880> self<00:03:38.299> toppers

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
screws in you have these self toppers

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:45.490 
screws in you have these self toppers
right<00:03:38.959> here<00:03:39.519> gonna<00:03:40.519> anchor<00:03:40.760> it<00:03:40.970> in<00:03:41.090> with<00:03:41.269> that

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:52.990 

I<00:03:45.620> think<00:03:46.490> it'll<00:03:46.640> work<00:03:46.700> pretty<00:03:47.000> well<00:03:50.770> whoo<00:03:52.000> that

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
I think it'll work pretty well whoo that

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:02.830 
I think it'll work pretty well whoo that
didn't<00:03:53.360> feel<00:03:54.370> great<00:04:01.300> well<00:04:02.300> that<00:04:02.450> sounded<00:04:02.690> good

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
didn't feel great well that sounded good

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.940 
didn't feel great well that sounded good
yeah<00:04:03.500> how<00:04:04.130> does<00:04:04.250> it<00:04:04.310> feel<00:04:05.530> everybody<00:04:06.530> so<00:04:06.800> we

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
yeah how does it feel everybody so we

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.310 
yeah how does it feel everybody so we
are<00:04:06.980> back<00:04:07.459> in<00:04:07.670> the<00:04:07.790> RV<00:04:07.970> right<00:04:08.450> now<00:04:08.630> you<00:04:09.050> can<00:04:09.200> see

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:09.320 
are back in the RV right now you can see

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:12.250 
are back in the RV right now you can see
the<00:04:09.440> plate<00:04:09.680> right<00:04:09.860> here<00:04:10.000> it<00:04:11.000> doesn't<00:04:11.360> look

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
the plate right here it doesn't look

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.610 
the plate right here it doesn't look
like<00:04:13.030> anything<00:04:14.030> stuck<00:04:14.390> but<00:04:15.140> I<00:04:15.170> really<00:04:15.500> don't

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
like anything stuck but I really don't

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.560 
like anything stuck but I really don't
mind<00:04:15.830> it<00:04:16.070> for<00:04:16.700> me<00:04:16.790> it's<00:04:16.940> just<00:04:16.970> a<00:04:17.150> reminder<00:04:17.359> of

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
mind it for me it's just a reminder of

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.050 
mind it for me it's just a reminder of
how<00:04:18.910> how<00:04:20.140> terrible<00:04:21.430> company<00:04:22.430> is<00:04:22.580> I<00:04:22.790> would<00:04:22.940> do

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
how how terrible company is I would do

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.060 
how how terrible company is I would do
something<00:04:23.300> like<00:04:23.390> that<00:04:23.480> but<00:04:23.870> it's<00:04:24.070> also

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
something like that but it's also

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.280 
something like that but it's also
looking<00:04:25.430> at<00:04:25.580> the<00:04:25.820> positive<00:04:26.450> and<00:04:26.900> things<00:04:27.110> like

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
looking at the positive and things like

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
drill I just had that little handheld

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.830 
drill I just had that little handheld
guy<00:05:06.710> and<00:05:07.130> it<00:05:07.250> didn't<00:05:07.460> work<00:05:07.580> too<00:05:07.729> well<00:05:07.880> but<00:05:08.090> the

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
guy and it didn't work too well but the

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.670 
guy and it didn't work too well but the
fridge<00:05:09.340> opens<00:05:10.340> and<00:05:10.610> closes<00:05:11.470> perfectly<00:05:12.470> fine

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
fridge opens and closes perfectly fine

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.380 
fridge opens and closes perfectly fine
now<00:05:12.979> it<00:05:13.940> has<00:05:14.150> that<00:05:14.419> brace<00:05:15.850> they<00:05:16.850> think<00:05:17.180> we're

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.390 
now it has that brace they think we're

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:21.840 
now it has that brace they think we're
gonna<00:05:17.570> keep<00:05:17.900> the<00:05:18.229> door<00:05:19.240> pretty<00:05:20.240> light<00:05:20.510> so

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:21.850 
gonna keep the door pretty light so

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.380 
gonna keep the door pretty light so
we're<00:05:22.850> not<00:05:22.970> gonna<00:05:23.120> stack<00:05:23.810> any<00:05:24.520> any<00:05:25.520> heavy

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.390 
we're not gonna stack any any heavy

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.150 
we're not gonna stack any any heavy
things<00:05:26.750> in<00:05:27.050> there<00:05:27.229> maybe<00:05:27.440> some<00:05:27.710> condiments

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
things in there maybe some condiments

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.300 
things in there maybe some condiments
maybe<00:05:28.490> some<00:05:28.790> lighter<00:05:29.150> things<00:05:29.600> but<00:05:30.100> the<00:05:31.100> real

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
maybe some lighter things but the real

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:32.950 
maybe some lighter things but the real
test<00:05:31.580> will<00:05:31.700> be<00:05:31.910> on<00:05:31.940> the<00:05:32.240> road<00:05:32.419> as<00:05:32.660> we're<00:05:32.840> going

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
test will be on the road as we're going

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.380 
test will be on the road as we're going
down<00:05:33.080> the<00:05:33.380> road<00:05:33.530> but<00:05:33.830> I<00:05:33.860> think<00:05:33.950> even<00:05:34.880> if<00:05:35.150> this

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.390 
down the road but I think even if this

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.710 
down the road but I think even if this
top<00:05:35.600> part<00:05:35.900> breaks<00:05:36.200> off<00:05:36.440> I<00:05:36.830> think<00:05:37.340> that<00:05:37.850> just

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 
top part breaks off I think that just

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.150 
top part breaks off I think that just
having<00:05:38.780> that<00:05:39.140> right<00:05:39.380> there<00:05:39.590> will<00:05:39.710> be<00:05:39.770> enough

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
having that right there will be enough

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.750 
having that right there will be enough
to<00:05:40.520> to<00:05:41.419> support<00:05:41.840> it<00:05:41.960> and<00:05:42.430> support<00:05:43.430> the<00:05:43.550> weight

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
to to support it and support the weight

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.720 
to to support it and support the weight
of<00:05:43.790> that<00:05:44.300> fridge
