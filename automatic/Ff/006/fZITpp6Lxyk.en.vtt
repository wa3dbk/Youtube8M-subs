00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:07.560
 nor the reality the canisters seals 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.420
 can be exchanged for 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.849
 wheelchairs 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.950
 teacher Maria began to save the 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.330
 after his brother told this 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.660
 story for her 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.779
 since then it has not stopped and still 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.580
 convinced the whole family to embrace this 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.439
 cause with this story began with my 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.449
 brother who came with the information that 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.640
 joining seals in the future could be 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.650
 changed by a wheelchair to 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.320
 who needs in small institution 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.600
 cotolengo and this a little work 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.940
 he managed to raise awareness of the 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.360
 whole family nowadays all over 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.010
 world takes through this small gesture 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.660
 which has become a habit now for everything 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.550
 The world here at home is bringing together 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.140
 to try to make a difference in the 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.570
 future for those who really need it 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.840
 after filling the bottles in March 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.010
 walk everything to the small cotolengo 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.360
 institution that cares for people with 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.340
 deficiency 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.120
 we went there to see if the exchange 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.729
 really happens and the answer was yes 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.830
 it's not a legend we use agents 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.380
 even with the benefit to our 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.000
 children is a chance to give to 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.640
 they deserve the quality they deserve 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.549
 through an always new chair 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.100
 always conserved and responding to 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.220
 physical need they have and the 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.220
 are fundamental in the finances of the 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.520
 small cotolengo today more than 150 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.400
 residents are wheelchair users and the exchange of 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.479
 chairs are constant and the course of a 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.240
 chair ranges from 1,500 to 3,000 reais 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.610
 to change the seals for a 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.700
 new wheelchair are required 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.549
 about 110 bottles like this 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.280
 so the more people create this 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.890
 habit better people are frightened by 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.200
 It will take so long to put these 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.180
 110 bottles do not need so it is 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.219
 a campaign because I felt 10 bottles 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.890
 pets for one person will only take time 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.680
 much but when we do the campaign 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.079
 and someone has at home two pet bottles 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.780
 another has two or more 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.670
 three plus three the other has one 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.260
 everyone and the solidarity that comes 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.790
 from all corners of the 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.590
 that we can always be playing 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.590
 a chair for our children
