00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.619
 I'm living with pajamas, I'm here 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.170
 in my other department do not look at the 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.190
 seen and you will wonder 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.190
 sound blasts 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 starting 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.740
 is playing the story mode 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.170
 as you can see 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:47.930
 guys this plan and obviously we're going to 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.930
 bring 2 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.880
 from the 37 covers 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.700
 a co -worker 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:06.229
 good guys wait to show you there 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:10.260
 that despite being a group of friends 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:12.510
 we are already starting there is no other 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.909
 compadre that is still sleeping 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.719
 shining 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.719
 and good guys 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.650
 it would be everything so I leave a greeting and 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.170
 I take advantage of telling them to follow 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.990
 starting not many are on vacation 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.850
 so as they are on vacation they have 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:37.090
 to start from the good 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:41.010
 I found a sober fisherman 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:44.860
 be so much fish to eat later 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:48.840
 and he has good in the camera 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:53.850
 Now I come to give an account of the thousand 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.850
 614 and what 's in sight 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:02.240
 good guys say goodbye greetings to 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:04.640
 all and this was a leisure video when 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.420
 an intro of call of duty play 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.420
 black ops 2 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.430
 how 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.420
 good 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.110
 guys the best of all before 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.940
 to say goodbye is that I realized that the 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:50.320
 game is completely folded to 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:52.450
 latin to latin spanish hopefully so 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.180
 they should do all the games folded 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.160
 to Latin Spanish or the guys at least 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:02.890
 but it is for games is a one 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:04.750
 more so let's hope that the step a 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.340
 example to follow for the other companies 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.500
 of video games that can double us 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.020
 us the games to the Latin as well as to 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.780
 the Spaniards double them up 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.640
 dogs that are thrown into their language already at 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.000
 bullshit when you guys 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:22.370
 I say goodbye to all of you and we 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.269
 let's see if it kills a 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.269
 a green background 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.080

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.540

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.680
