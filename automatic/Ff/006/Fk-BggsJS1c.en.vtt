00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.350
 Market leader even in ten years, that's not our goal because of us 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.670
 we have no choice in one of his comrades for the last 40 years 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.870
 We caught a million guests and caught the man 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.970

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.960
 We want to work on the word for a while 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.550

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.930
 to strengthen the premium segment to specialist retailers and our employees 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.200
 Of course, we also confessed where in the hardware stores more samples begin 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.970
