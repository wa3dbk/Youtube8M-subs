00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello continue to collect i'll 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.920
 set today on the agenda choice 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.470
 connecting rod systems 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.080
 they come in different types excellent 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.230
 mainly on the material used carbon 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.830
 either aluminum and they also differ in 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.109
 size and either a combination of stars in 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.119
 mostly used stars but there are 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.140
 combinations of three 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:26.340
 Dimensions denoted as standard with 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:31.019
 larger than star 53 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:34.410
 and small 39 compact 53 4 and 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.739
 for cutting 5542 there is a system 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.660
 connecting rods with integrated axle 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:43.350
 warm comp ultra bargaining basically the same 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:47.730
 the connecting rod system is fixed by 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.370
 separate carriage frames also connecting rods 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.860
 different in length determine 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.480
 required size of stars and slices easily 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.100
 if the bike will be used 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.100
 universally they are for some 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.340
 specific route then most often 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.790
 uses a compact version of the system 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.840
 if you have a flat terrain 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.390
 use we will arrive a certain route 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.770
 for example, you can choose to work 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.290
 larger size eg standard choice 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.790
 for cutting speaks for itself 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.860
 determine the perfect length of chicons 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.520
 harder it depends most on 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.820
 facilities 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.640
 most manufacturers offer 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.810
 range of lengths and rods from 165 to a hundred 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.220
 eighty millimeters 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.770
 There are also such findings comedians with 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:38.100
 retractable floating-length connecting rods 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.340
 lymph scriptures to get a landmark 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:45.149
 extending connecting rods necessary functions 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:48.210
 his legs multiply by zero as many as 216 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:52.619
 thousand and round the resulting value with 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.299
 commercially available version of the bears as the 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.219
 carriage and chose installed already in the past 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.840
 is about the special choice for the system not 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.420
 left it should have been 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.250
 widths for isis drive type real 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.469
 packaging is especially nice when you buy 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.180
 components just cheaper yes better 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.810
 bike designed for use 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.640
 mainly for trips across the plains 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.709
 cool and sentences got great 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.020
 compacts were therefore picked up 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:17.470
 standard movie rods for me 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.480
 optimal 175 millimeters and so systems 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.190
 whispering past very cool italian 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.069
 the company has become from fool model gaytsy 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.470
 price 2007 seems quotes area 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.810
 600 700 dollars today acquired everywhere 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.880
 78 Europe auctions and carbon material 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.190
 although I read somewhere that this spider 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.599
 part is aluminum clad in carbon 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.620
 it doesn't matter because all systems 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:41.140
 weighs only 500 75 grams well, plus 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.630
 minus 20 grams is different from the actual 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:47.230
 shove cola vikula which costs about 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.239
 1000 euros there if the weight is important to me 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.850
 more important was the price though the penalties of the game 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.560
 but they came across was from 120 euros and then 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.769
 that the Italian star is lighter by more 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.390
 than 200 grams is only a nice bonus now 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.160
 for the installation we will need clamping 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.130
 the bolts that came with the carriage 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.799
 Hex key grease grease splines 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.110
 carriages us one right connecting rod and tighten 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:10.060
 clamping bolt to about the same failure 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.850
 the left side will be the rest 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.470
 grease napkin ready after the first 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.799
 trip will need to check the protracted 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.799
 moment
