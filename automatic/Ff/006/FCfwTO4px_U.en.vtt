00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.550
 to testify 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:28.800
 that come into contact with the mystery of schooling 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:31.560
 birth of god flock occurrence of god in 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.239
 human story about it

 god made man without ceasing 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.879
 God be the one who did not hold 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:51.289

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:54.410
 incomparable universe god god creator of the world 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:58.469

 becomes one of us enters the flesh and 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.830
 blood of human history and the very 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.320
 start it is incomprehensible and events by 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.780
 differently perceived by people alone 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.670
 met him with joy hopefully 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:17.820
 With love, these were Wifley Omsk and shepherds 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:20.689
 these were oriental wise men these were those 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.850
 who surrounded the savior the virgin mary 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:28.259
 Joseph's handcuff and probably there were still people 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:31.619
 who are open-hearted with pure 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.170
 the heart looked at the baby wonderfully 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:38.460
 born bethlehem cave 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.189
 but were you see who didn't start off 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.470
 adopted christ 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:45.420
 the very people who didn't let the virgin 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.770
 Joseph Handcuff Mary 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:53.159
 under the roof are those who have no place for 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.490
 they did not want to let them promise these 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.920
 people make these people hard 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.340
 somewhere to place did not disturb their peace 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.469
 or the rooms of the guests did not create 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.190
 difficulties did not create some 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.190
 discomfort for their lives but there were also 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.220
 other 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.830
 for whom the birth of the savior was 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.590
 a kind of challenge not only their well-being 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:21.790
 but their power and might and that 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:24.130
 the main sinful way of life for 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.700
 the next two thousand years to ask 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.860
 almost nothing has changed the world 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.120
 divided into those who gladly accept 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:38.400
 the savior who connects his life with him 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:43.270
 who gives his mind his heart to him and 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:46.600
 it gives peace peace of joy joy 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:49.600
 life on Isa those people who can not 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.590
 accept the savior because for them it 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.860
 means 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.620
 renegotiation habitual rejection 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.340
 from some ideas that they 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.790
 roads 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.690
 close and sometimes making of Christ 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:07.390
 requires not only speculative 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:10.720
 agreement with the fact of its implementation but 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:16.120
 life changes and so many people are not 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:18.120
 ready for this change church on 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:22.450
 throughout its history 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.670
 dealt with some of the others and those 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:28.750
 who does not accept Christ is not 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:32.640
 the enemy of the church is the same brothers and 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:36.070
 sisters for which lord came and 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:40.390
 christian task church task 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:44.160
 is that those who think 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:49.150
 yourself unable to believe and accept it 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:52.930
 believed and accepted with all my heart realizing 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:55.720
 that for their sake lord came but here's another 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.500
 It taught us the whole story related 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:03.790
 merry christmas events around 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:07.600
 of this birth if lord was received 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.170
 shepherds ordinary people it does not mean 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.740
 whether that 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.330
 and we have it today 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:18.670
 should look not where brilliance and gold 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:22.360
 not where power and strength but where 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:28.520
 weakness and need 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:31.430
 that's why god addressing his 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:35.560
 followers and says that 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:37.360
 necessary to achieve the kingdom of God 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:41.630
 visit patients 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:45.140
 visit the prisoners to share their 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.070
 opportunities with those who need our 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.110
 help 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:51.170
 and this is primarily disabled 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:54.520
 aged children and now hope 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:58.400
 I would especially like to say these days 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:02.390
 we have many children who do not have 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:08.360
 parents even with living parents and how 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:10.570
 it is important that our people be happy with 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:14.690
 special gratitude to god 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:18.620
 accepted their families orphans let them not 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:22.850
 only shelter and education but also giving them 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:27.040
 your love do not stop children from coming 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:29.140
 the Lord says to me and that is the word 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:32.840
 in a sense 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:36.080
 all of us must equip understanding 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.480
 how significant in the eyes of God 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.830
 children 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.490
 precisely in connection with the holiday of Christmas 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:45.080
 Christ's 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:48.670
 I would like to appeal to all 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:51.440

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:55.130
 aimed at establishing children on 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:06:00.110
 keeping orphans take this step in 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:06:02.690
 Our country should not be orphans those who 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.190

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:08.030
