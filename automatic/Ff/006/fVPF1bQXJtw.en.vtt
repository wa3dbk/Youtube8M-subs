one<00:02:21.600> of<00:02:21.690> his<00:02:21.810> goof<00:02:22.020> up<00:02:22.230> sounds<00:02:22.680> but<00:02:22.830> I<00:02:22.860> thought

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
one of his goof up sounds but I thought

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.800 
one of his goof up sounds but I thought
I'd<00:02:23.220> throw<00:02:23.400> it<00:02:23.460> in<00:02:23.610> here<00:02:23.820> so<00:02:24.210> it's<00:02:24.420> pretty<00:02:24.570> cool

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
I'd throw it in here so it's pretty cool

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.870 
I'd throw it in here so it's pretty cool
okay<00:02:25.380> now<00:02:25.860> we're<00:02:26.010> gonna<00:02:26.070> create<00:02:26.340> an<00:02:26.430> object

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
okay now we're gonna create an object

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.100 
okay now we're gonna create an object
and<00:02:27.170> we'll<00:02:28.170> call<00:02:28.320> this<00:02:28.440> object<00:02:29.690> use<00:02:30.690> it<00:02:30.870> I

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
and we'll call this object use it I

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.500 
and we'll call this object use it I
guess<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:31.980> we're<00:02:32.940> not<00:02:33.000> gonna<00:02:33.150> give<00:02:33.390> it

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
guess and we're not gonna give it

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.760 
guess and we're not gonna give it
anything<00:02:33.780> but<00:02:33.930> we<00:02:34.170> are<00:02:34.290> gonna<00:02:34.410> make<00:02:34.590> this

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
anything but we are gonna make this

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.950 
anything but we are gonna make this
object<00:02:35.010> persistent<00:02:35.850> now<00:02:36.240> what<00:02:36.390> that<00:02:36.420> means<00:02:36.570> is

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
object persistent now what that means is

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.020 
object persistent now what that means is
you<00:02:37.140> can<00:02:37.290> put<00:02:37.500> this<00:02:37.530> object<00:02:38.100> in<00:02:38.220> one<00:02:38.490> room<00:02:38.760> and

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
you can put this object in one room and

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.870 
you can put this object in one room and
it<00:02:39.840> will<00:02:40.050> stay<00:02:40.470> in<00:02:40.680> every<00:02:41.100> single<00:02:41.340> room<00:02:41.670> that

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
it will stay in every single room that

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.970 
it will stay in every single room that
you<00:02:41.970> have<00:02:42.180> in<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.420> game<00:02:42.620> so<00:02:43.620> it<00:02:43.740> can<00:02:43.860> be<00:02:43.950> like

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
you have in the game so it can be like

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.660 
you have in the game so it can be like
an<00:02:44.990> overlord<00:02:45.990> type<00:02:46.530> object<00:02:47.070> that<00:02:47.250> goes<00:02:47.430> into

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
an overlord type object that goes into

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.160 
an overlord type object that goes into
every<00:02:48.000> room<00:02:48.120> even<00:02:48.330> if<00:02:48.540> you<00:02:48.600> only<00:02:48.720> put<00:02:48.930> it<00:02:49.020> into

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
every room even if you only put it into

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.260 
every room even if you only put it into
one<00:02:49.350> so<00:02:49.590> it's<00:02:49.710> really<00:02:49.890> useful<00:02:50.150> we're<00:02:51.150> gonna

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
one so it's really useful we're gonna

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.630 
one so it's really useful we're gonna
add<00:02:51.450> an<00:02:51.600> event<00:02:51.720> a<00:02:52.050> create<00:02:52.350> event<00:02:52.620> and<00:02:53.310> inside

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
add an event a create event and inside

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.690 
add an event a create event and inside
of<00:02:53.730> this<00:02:53.820> event<00:02:54.150> we're<00:02:54.330> gonna<00:02:54.420> call<00:02:55.460> some<00:02:56.460> code

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
of this event we're gonna call some code

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.030 
of this event we're gonna call some code
and<00:02:57.390> we're<00:02:57.540> gonna<00:02:57.660> do<00:02:58.700> sound<00:02:59.870> loop<00:03:00.890> and<00:03:01.890> then

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
and we're gonna do sound loop and then

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.590 
and we're gonna do sound loop and then
just<00:03:02.190> put<00:03:02.430> sound<00:03:03.240> background<00:03:05.210> so<00:03:06.210> that<00:03:06.360> should

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
just put sound background so that should

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.570 
just put sound background so that should
loop<00:03:06.840> our<00:03:07.080> back<00:03:07.260> on<00:03:07.530> music<00:03:07.920> for<00:03:08.190> the<00:03:08.280> entire

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
loop our back on music for the entire

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.770 
loop our back on music for the entire
game<00:03:08.820> so<00:03:10.880> make<00:03:11.880> sure<00:03:11.910> you<00:03:12.180> have<00:03:12.330> a<00:03:12.360> good<00:03:12.600> one

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
game so make sure you have a good one

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.420 
game so make sure you have a good one
that<00:03:12.810> can<00:03:13.260> loop<00:03:13.500> well<00:03:13.740> and<00:03:13.980> doesn't<00:03:14.250> sound

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
that can loop well and doesn't sound

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.880 
that can loop well and doesn't sound
annoying<00:03:14.870> mine<00:03:15.870> actually<00:03:16.380> sounds<00:03:16.650> kind<00:03:16.860> of

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
annoying mine actually sounds kind of

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.710 
annoying mine actually sounds kind of
annoying<00:03:17.160> so<00:03:17.460> I<00:03:17.490> wouldn't<00:03:17.760> recommend<00:03:18.000> using

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
annoying so I wouldn't recommend using

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.900 
annoying so I wouldn't recommend using
this<00:03:18.990> one<00:03:19.140> not<00:03:19.740> that<00:03:19.890> the<00:03:20.010> music<00:03:20.520> is<00:03:20.640> annoying

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
this one not that the music is annoying

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.880 
this one not that the music is annoying
but<00:03:21.330> that<00:03:21.480> this<00:03:21.630> one<00:03:21.810> doesn't<00:03:22.020> loop<00:03:22.380> well<00:03:22.650> for

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
but that this one doesn't loop well for

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.910 
but that this one doesn't loop well for
this<00:03:22.980> type<00:03:23.190> of<00:03:23.220> game<00:03:23.580> so<00:03:24.060> let's<00:03:24.960> do<00:03:25.260> a<00:03:25.290> object

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
this type of game so let's do a object

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.880 
this type of game so let's do a object
music<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:26.760> I'm<00:03:27.060> gonna<00:03:27.210> put<00:03:27.510> it<00:03:27.600> in<00:03:27.780> the<00:03:27.960> menu

the problem if you try and click while

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.990 
the problem if you try and click while
the<00:03:51.780> sound<00:03:51.990> is<00:03:52.110> still<00:03:52.260> playing<00:03:52.680> then<00:03:53.430> it<00:03:53.760> won't

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
the sound is still playing then it won't

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.400 
the sound is still playing then it won't
play<00:03:54.210> the<00:03:54.450> sound<00:03:54.660> because<00:03:54.930> the<00:03:54.960> sound<00:03:55.170> is

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
play the sound because the sound is

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.170 
play the sound because the sound is
already<00:03:55.650> playing<00:03:55.920> so<00:03:56.460> what<00:03:56.580> you<00:03:56.700> want<00:03:56.880> to<00:03:56.970> do

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
already playing so what you want to do

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:03.500 
already playing so what you want to do
is<00:03:57.990> to<00:03:58.890> sound<00:03:59.280> stop<00:04:00.290> right<00:04:01.290> before<00:04:01.320> this<00:04:02.510> that

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
is to sound stop right before this that

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.450 
is to sound stop right before this that
way<00:04:03.690> if<00:04:03.870> the<00:04:04.020> sound<00:04:04.260> is<00:04:04.380> already<00:04:04.650> playing<00:04:05.070> then

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:05.460 
way if the sound is already playing then

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.910 
way if the sound is already playing then
you're<00:04:05.610> gonna<00:04:05.700> stop<00:04:06.060> it<00:04:06.300> and<00:04:06.510> start<00:04:07.320> it<00:04:07.500> start

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
you're gonna stop it and start it start

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.949 
you're gonna stop it and start it start
the<00:04:08.040> new<00:04:08.220> one<00:04:08.430> and<00:04:08.670> just<00:04:09.330> trust<00:04:09.600> me<00:04:09.750> on<00:04:09.870> this

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
the new one and just trust me on this

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.449 
the new one and just trust me on this
one<00:04:10.020> that'll<00:04:10.380> sound<00:04:10.500> better<00:04:10.709> and<00:04:10.920> you<00:04:11.430> can

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
one that'll sound better and you can

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:16.090 
one that'll sound better and you can
copy<00:04:11.910> these<00:04:12.270> and<00:04:13.760> we're<00:04:14.760> gonna<00:04:14.850> go<00:04:15.060> into<00:04:15.420> our
