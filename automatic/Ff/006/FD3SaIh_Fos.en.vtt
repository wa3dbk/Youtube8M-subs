00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.600 
do the heck am i doing alright let's
gonna<00:01:42.020> pipe<00:01:42.200> that<00:01:42.380> back<00:01:42.530> so<00:01:42.770> anyways<00:01:43.070> the<00:01:43.250> the

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
gonna pipe that back so anyways the the

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.100 
gonna pipe that back so anyways the the
shorter<00:01:43.880> grass<00:01:44.090> waves<00:01:44.450> and<00:01:44.750> then<00:01:44.840> you<00:01:44.930> arrive

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
shorter grass waves and then you arrive

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.920 
shorter grass waves and then you arrive
here<00:01:45.410> which<00:01:45.680> is<00:01:45.860> like<00:01:46.160> the<00:01:46.430> I<00:01:47.000> guess<00:01:47.690> what

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
here which is like the I guess what

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.680 
here which is like the I guess what
would<00:01:48.050> you<00:01:48.200> call<00:01:48.410> that<00:01:48.470> that's<00:01:48.950> like<00:01:49.690> the

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
would you call that that's like the

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.240 
would you call that that's like the
large<00:01:50.900> fern<00:01:51.200> okay<00:01:51.440> so<00:01:51.500> this<00:01:51.740> is<00:01:51.890> a<00:01:51.950> smaller

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
large fern okay so this is a smaller

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.830 
large fern okay so this is a smaller
firm<00:01:52.550> so<00:01:52.730> they<00:01:52.820> even<00:01:52.940> though<00:01:53.120> the<00:01:53.300> small<00:01:53.420> fern

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
firm so they even though the small fern

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.140 
firm so they even though the small fern
sways<00:01:54.830> from<00:01:55.100> side<00:01:55.280> to<00:01:55.310> side<00:01:55.580> but<00:01:55.820> it<00:01:55.970> just

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
sways from side to side but it just

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.270 
sways from side to side but it just
looks<00:01:56.330> absolutely<00:01:56.510> awesome<00:01:57.200> makes<00:01:57.890> the<00:01:58.070> world

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
looks absolutely awesome makes the world

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.310 
looks absolutely awesome makes the world
look<00:01:58.490> really<00:01:58.880> really<00:01:59.150> cool<00:01:59.420> and<00:01:59.780> I'm<00:02:00.290> really

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
look really really cool and I'm really

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.050 
look really really cool and I'm really
you<00:02:00.890> know<00:02:01.010> excited<00:02:01.430> to<00:02:01.490> see<00:02:01.640> where<00:02:01.790> he<00:02:01.940> goes

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
you know excited to see where he goes

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.540 
you know excited to see where he goes
with<00:02:02.120> this<00:02:02.420> I'm<00:02:03.050> not<00:02:03.230> to<00:02:03.440> ensure<00:02:04.100> I'm<00:02:04.280> not<00:02:04.400> too

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
with this I'm not to ensure I'm not too

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.640 
with this I'm not to ensure I'm not too
sure<00:02:04.820> entirely<00:02:05.390> if<00:02:05.750> it<00:02:05.930> is<00:02:06.050> compatible<00:02:06.590> with

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
sure entirely if it is compatible with

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.130 
sure entirely if it is compatible with
the<00:02:06.920> shaders<00:02:07.250> mod<00:02:07.300> you<00:02:08.300> know<00:02:08.390> actually<00:02:08.780> having

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
the shaders mod you know actually having

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.839 
the shaders mod you know actually having
them<00:02:09.379> both<00:02:09.560> installed<00:02:09.920> I<00:02:10.220> don't<00:02:10.399> think<00:02:10.640> that's

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
them both installed I don't think that's

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.330 
them both installed I don't think that's
actually<00:02:11.209> even<00:02:11.569> possible<00:02:11.930> but<00:02:12.160> I'll<00:02:13.160> have<00:02:13.310> a
