00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 That's how we want to be in the middle of autumn 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.319
 on the way in potsdam and today 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.529
 just with this light and that is the 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.529
 Sun 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.810
 friends we are in the middle of potsdam today 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.280
 and we looked at that tree there 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.660
 in the back it is very very autumnal 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.650
 leaves fall down and left already 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.510
 everywhere on the ground and we use 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.450
 today only a light source and that is 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.520
 the sun and without reflectors and 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.020
 other bums yes, we actually wanted 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.510
 Dear friends, 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.700
 a beautiful red tree with red 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.650
 I was there week but one page 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.270
 can not always be with nature 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.720
 count all leaves have fallen off 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.820
 the tree 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.379
 that too can happen but we 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.300
 are really improvisational and 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.369
 That's why today we only use the 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.950
 is a natural light source of the sun 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:10.040
 today a very cloudy day as so 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.509
 drab in as it is called vg foggy so 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.280
 a bit and that 's the sun 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:16.670
 actually a huge softbox the 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.850
 sun is exactly behind from behind so behind 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.590
 me directly on the front of the model 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.270
 and is thus really like a flash 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.490
 it is heart through the sun is very 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.410
 very very very deep so almost in this 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.750
 angle would be like a lightning from 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.720
 meets the sun and the light on the 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.160
 model and of course for me 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.440
 perfect starting situation around easy 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.479
 without a tool to take a picture 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.030
 We will be here this yellow tree 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.069
 take with the yellow leaves on the 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.330
 ground red dress fit for 

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:46.130
 Rothenbaum in the end and when it comes to 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.970
 we will probably be completely free 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.350
 naked rips his projects are easy 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.030
 in photoshop and everything to ward 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.959
 everything that is yellow I will dye red 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.619
 and then in the end I'll turn red 

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:56.619
 have picture 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.399
 archaeologists are setting quite whole 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.959
 just the nice thing is when you are with the 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.280
 Sun works or with natural 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.550
 light sources or with permanent light 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.510
 you can make the setting by eye 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.190
 so it does not flashed perhaps 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.230
 possible because you can do that later 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.060
 if you just take Photomatix to the 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.200
 liveview look at me like it's cool 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.760
 looks and then made the 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.920
 I am currently at the 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.260
 Settings at an aperture 8 100 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.260
 shutter time iso 200 that looks perfect 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.069
 from here a good overall picture she has 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.900
 a bit of shadow in the face 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.610
 still bright enough at all 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.470
 pages so just looks fresh and 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.150
 As I said you can do it through the liveview 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.040
 simply determined you just look 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.500
 on the display on it and then determines 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.299
 the exposure is very easy 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.590
 Of course, what you pay attention to here now 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.209
 must be that the sun 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.349
 from there the sun would come from now 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.030
 there will be no sense there 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:54.140
 because the light is above her 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.599
 would have to come back means you would have to 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.970
 Reflecting means that the sun is 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:01.250
 almost the light source like a flash like 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.750
 a permanent light lamp and just shines 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.370
 as well as I could enter the model too 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.780
 Then there would be a little more sitting there 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.790
 the light just from there I can 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.230
 unfortunately the sun does not pretend yes 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.620
 I 'm not bruce omnipotent could it 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.620
 try 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.090
 but it does not have to be the sun stays on 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:21.340
 That's why we have to do the same job 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.340
 move the model yourself move 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.050
 Today, just give it a try 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.030
 use the sun as the main 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.500
 light source on such a magnificent 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.550
 autumn like today you can do that 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.990
 wonderful to use in winter of course 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.460
 there it is only a bit 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.230
 colder today you realize that i have t 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.730
 Shirt on it is relatively warm 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.870
 if not just autumn or winter 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.160
 should be in the evening 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.630
 take pictures so watch the sun 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.970
 when the sun is relatively low 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:52.130
 perfect time to take pictures right now 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.870
 So fall is always perfect and time 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:56.600
 then just put the model down so 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.490
 that the light the frontal head on it 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.500
 the camera seems to adjust over the 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:05.270
 liveview and you will get good pictures 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:07.130
 make a thing even more channel 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.310
 subscribe video easily favor 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.310
 are 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.640
 you already have the last one 

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.590
 video seen there it was so mike who 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.640
 maik is and what makes him so 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.640
