00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
feels a bit higher but whatever 84

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.250 
feels a bit higher but whatever 84
dribbling<00:02:18.970> he's<00:02:19.180> got<00:02:19.360> good<00:02:19.480> passing<00:02:19.959> as<00:02:20.050> well

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
dribbling he's got good passing as well

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.120 
dribbling he's got good passing as well
and<00:02:20.580> yeah<00:02:21.580> he<00:02:21.730> just<00:02:21.850> provides<00:02:22.240> that<00:02:22.420> link<00:02:22.750> from

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
and yeah he just provides that link from

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.230 
and yeah he just provides that link from
defense<00:02:24.130> to<00:02:24.220> midfield<00:02:24.430> which<00:02:24.790> i<00:02:24.940> think<00:02:25.000> is

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
defense to midfield which i think is

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.830 
defense to midfield which i think is
very<00:02:25.300> important<00:02:25.990> in<00:02:26.110> ultimate<00:02:26.410> team<00:02:26.970> I<00:02:27.970> had<00:02:28.660> to

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
very important in ultimate team I had to

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.449 
very important in ultimate team I had to
sort<00:02:29.110> of<00:02:29.200> even<00:02:29.500> out<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:29.709> rating<00:02:30.040> so<00:02:30.220> I've<00:02:30.310> got

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
sort of even out the rating so I've got

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.900 
sort of even out the rating so I've got
some<00:02:30.610> guy<00:02:30.790> called<00:02:31.030> fer<00:02:32.370> probably<00:02:33.370> that's<00:02:33.610> not
