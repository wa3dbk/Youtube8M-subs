ship<00:00:07.080> from<00:00:07.410> the<00:00:07.500> show<00:00:07.710> out<00:00:08.160> of<00:00:08.519> play-doh<00:00:08.940> I

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
ship from the show out of play-doh I

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.680 
ship from the show out of play-doh I
don't<00:00:10.230> know<00:00:10.290> if<00:00:10.380> he<00:00:10.469> can<00:00:10.590> do<00:00:10.740> it<00:00:10.889> let's<00:00:11.280> see

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690 
don't know if he can do it let's see

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.150 
don't know if he can do it let's see
first<00:00:12.690> we<00:00:13.019> need<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.259> take<00:00:13.440> our<00:00:13.620> play-doh

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
first we need to take our play-doh

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.210 
first we need to take our play-doh
and<00:00:14.370> make<00:00:15.269> kind<00:00:16.139> of<00:00:16.289> an<00:00:16.410> egg<00:00:16.590> shape<00:00:16.949> because

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
and make kind of an egg shape because

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.099 
and make kind of an egg shape because
isn't<00:00:17.369> that<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:18.240> shape<00:00:18.480> that<00:00:18.660> rocket<00:00:18.990> is

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
isn't that the shape that rocket is

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.450 
isn't that the shape that rocket is
start<00:00:19.920> out<00:00:20.100> by<00:00:20.130> rolling<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.880> ball<00:00:21.060> in<00:00:21.240> our<00:00:21.390> hands

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
start out by rolling a ball in our hands

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.000 
start out by rolling a ball in our hands
now<00:00:23.460> we're<00:00:23.670> going<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:23.880> make<00:00:24.119> it<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.390> little<00:00:24.689> more

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.010 
now we're going to make it a little more

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.189 
now we're going to make it a little more
egg<00:00:26.010> like<00:00:26.519> because<00:00:27.420> Rockets<00:00:27.779> got<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.080> be

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
egg like because Rockets got to be

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.299 
egg like because Rockets got to be
aerodynamic<00:00:29.099> right<00:00:29.420> is<00:00:30.420> that<00:00:30.599> his<00:00:30.779> shape<00:00:31.309> what

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
aerodynamic right is that his shape what

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.540 
aerodynamic right is that his shape what
do<00:00:32.399> you<00:00:32.489> think<00:00:32.730> so<00:00:33.510> we<00:00:33.660> can<00:00:33.809> either<00:00:34.550> make

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
do you think so we can either make

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.270 
do you think so we can either make
textures<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.480> windows<00:00:37.079> or<00:00:37.920> we<00:00:38.129> could

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
textures of the windows or we could

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.299 
textures of the windows or we could
actually<00:00:38.899> use<00:00:39.899> play-doh<00:00:40.260> as<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.770> windows<00:00:41.100> I

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
actually use play-doh as the windows I

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.880 
actually use play-doh as the windows I
think<00:00:41.610> for<00:00:42.030> this<00:00:42.329> video<00:00:42.780> I'm<00:00:43.410> going<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.829> make

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
think for this video I'm going to make

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.209 
think for this video I'm going to make
textures<00:00:44.550> forming<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.539> windows<00:00:47.180> so<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:49.160> have<00:00:50.160> a

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
textures forming the windows so I have a

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.240 
textures forming the windows so I have a
little<00:00:50.430> piece<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.610> plastic<00:00:51.120> here<00:00:51.649> and<00:00:52.649> we<00:00:53.039> have

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
little piece of plastic here and we have

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.290 
little piece of plastic here and we have
to<00:00:53.460> draw<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.940> line<00:00:54.360> for<00:00:55.260> where<00:00:55.910> rock<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.059> opens

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
to draw a line for where rock it opens

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.330 
to draw a line for where rock it opens
up<00:00:57.480> right<00:00:57.750> because<00:00:57.989> he<00:00:58.079> opens<00:00:58.320> up<00:00:58.469> so<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.770> the

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
up right because he opens up so that the

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:08.179 
up right because he opens up so that the
kids<00:00:59.640> can<00:00:59.910> all<00:01:00.059> get<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.270> him<00:01:03.379> right<00:01:07.070> next<00:01:08.070> he

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
kids can all get in him right next he

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.830 
kids can all get in him right next he
has<00:01:08.220> windows<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:09.299> that's<00:01:09.479> where<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:09.750> would

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
has windows so that's where it would

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.120 
has windows so that's where it would
open<00:01:09.960> up<00:01:10.310> and<00:01:11.310> then<00:01:11.430> he<00:01:11.549> has<00:01:11.640> windows

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:22.490 

just<00:01:15.890> this<00:01:19.280> and<00:01:20.479> the<00:01:21.479> windows<00:01:21.900> meet<00:01:22.170> right

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
just this and the windows meet right

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.510 
just this and the windows meet right
where<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.310> opens<00:01:23.580> up<00:01:23.729> out<00:01:25.100> and<00:01:26.100> they<00:01:26.280> come<00:01:26.490> down

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
where it opens up out and they come down

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.859 
where it opens up out and they come down
like<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.119> twist<00:01:27.420> back<00:01:28.700> okay<00:01:29.700> careful<00:01:30.509> not<00:01:30.720> to

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
like that twist back okay careful not to

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.480 
like that twist back okay careful not to
squeeze<00:01:31.080> it<00:01:31.229> too<00:01:31.409> hard<00:01:31.440> as<00:01:31.799> you're<00:01:32.009> making

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
squeeze it too hard as you're making

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.130 
squeeze it too hard as you're making
your<00:01:32.700> shapes<00:01:33.060> seen<00:01:33.720> there's<00:01:33.899> a<00:01:33.960> line<00:01:34.110> there

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
your shapes seen there's a line there

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.940 
your shapes seen there's a line there
and<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.649> think<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.130> line<00:01:35.690> there<00:01:36.720> well<00:01:37.259> dropped

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
and I think the line there well dropped

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.730 
and I think the line there well dropped
it<00:01:38.479> okay

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
it okay

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.109 
it okay
well<00:01:40.740> in<00:01:40.830> this<00:01:40.920> version<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.310> rocket<00:01:41.700> is<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.850> lot

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
well in this version of rocket is a lot

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.999 
well in this version of rocket is a lot
smaller<00:01:42.450> than<00:01:42.600> than<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.380> actual<00:01:43.649> one<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:43.890> we

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
smaller than than the actual one that we

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.980 
smaller than than the actual one that we
have<00:01:44.190> that<00:01:44.430> we<00:01:44.520> have<00:01:44.729> on<00:01:44.909> other<00:01:45.060> videos<00:01:45.420> but

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
have that we have on other videos but

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.300 
have that we have on other videos but
remember<00:01:46.259> this<00:01:46.350> is<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.500> small<00:01:46.800> tub<00:01:47.009> of<00:01:47.130> play-doh

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
remember this is a small tub of play-doh

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.450 
remember this is a small tub of play-doh
okay<00:01:48.110> what<00:01:49.110> else<00:01:49.140> does<00:01:49.470> rocket<00:01:49.770> have<00:01:49.920> Dino

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
okay what else does rocket have Dino

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.109 
okay what else does rocket have Dino
OOP<00:01:51.590> there<00:01:52.590> she's<00:01:52.800> antenna<00:01:53.159> what<00:01:53.789> else<00:01:53.940> does

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
OOP there she's antenna what else does

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.469 
OOP there she's antenna what else does
he<00:01:54.149> have<00:01:54.420> yes<00:01:54.869> wheels<00:01:55.170> doesn't<00:01:56.210> every<00:01:57.210> plane

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
he have yes wheels doesn't every plane

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.990 
he have yes wheels doesn't every plane
needs<00:01:57.750> landing<00:01:58.229> gear<00:01:58.440> right<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:58.950> believe<00:01:59.759> he

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
needs landing gear right I believe he

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.999 
needs landing gear right I believe he
has<00:02:00.210> two<00:02:00.509> in<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.840> back<00:02:01.050> and<00:02:01.380> one<00:02:01.530> in<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.740> front

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
has two in the back and one in the front

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.620 
has two in the back and one in the front
there<00:02:02.819> we<00:02:03.030> go
