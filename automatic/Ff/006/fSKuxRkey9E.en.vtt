00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.240
 also director of the collection of 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.280
 choice of success at studyrama 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.690
 collection that specializes in 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.320
 contest success 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.970
 CV is an important element for 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.680
 contests and more or less important 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.230
 finally second the contests all to 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.090
 do you then actually seem to you from the resume 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.779
 Moreover, it is a theme that we 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.669
 discusses very thoroughly in the 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.989
 bible motivational interviews and 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.670
 personalities then it's from elsewhere 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.020
 a shock we had done because 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.129
 that the interviews 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.620
 rely more and more today 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.090
 on the famous CVs that are filled by 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.230
 students so in fact it takes 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.050
 know that CVs in their broad sense 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.610
 are going to be present at every contest if 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.899
 we are a candidate for the sesame contest 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.149
 post-bac competition today for 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.760
 terminals we will have more mini 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.739
 CV that we will have to fill before 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.000
 go back to the interview room when one is 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.940
 now contest at essec or 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.040
 the EDHEC to bac + 3 to bac + 4 we will have to 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.240
 to make a real CV like a 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.280
 CV that we send when we are looking for a 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.060
 stage and we will have to join one of 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.670
 this application 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.159
 the resume will be noted he will have a note there 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.310
 will have a comment a letter to plus ab 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.500
 - which will be attributed to this CV so we 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.540
 feels that the cd is a passage 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.170
 obliged for all competitions we will 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.759
 brought to pass 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.390
 so this is an exercise that is 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.610
 particularly difficult demanding I 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.439
 think we all remember our 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.659
 first CVs that were very difficult 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.829
 to shape people at the level of 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.450
 the form is still a job and 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.680
 which is still step by step obvious and 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.119
 at the bottom level it will take when 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.619
 even made want because we know that 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.990
 it's just a few words 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.060
 we gave envy and I believe that there is a 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.740
 big work here to undertake that 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.630
 the other sometimes accompany because I 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.060
 think you have to ask your parents 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.970
 at september season who are in the 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.520
 professional world of dd to do 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.869
 a resume and I think if you do it alone 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.280
 we can sometimes street in traps 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.020
 pretty classic 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.780
 are there any basic rules to 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.490
 respect advice of course to give 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.590
 well let's see in the traps for example 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.509
 the smap and the low of the cv the moment we go 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.009
 to tackle the part of the activities 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.099
 extra school so we'll say what he 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.700
 a little bit the color of the candidate 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:19.590
 are its particularity and of course 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.260
 beat CV it's very important to only 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.680
 especially not lie a lot of candidates 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.049
 m literature or hulu the press or the 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.760
 general culture to make people want to 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:31.829
 juries saying that since that's what 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.110
 lacks as many masters as that they 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:36.930
 will believe that all of a sudden I am 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.909
 the ideal candidate is absolutely false 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.890
 when I say lying, it's a word 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:43.019
 a little strong but we will say it would be 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.930
 that that put something where I 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.409
 I'm just good, you do not have to 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.629
 make 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:50.879
 a second piece of advice compared to this bottom 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:52.379
 of the resume it is very advisable to give 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.819
 want to a jury I can tell you me 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:57.200
 even I correct CVs for some 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:59.970
 contest to put so-called 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.060
 precise activities so it must be said by 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.780
 example American literature of 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:09.450
 80s French literature 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:13.949
 contemporary also speaks of cinema 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:16.530
 badminton de niro such level 

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:18.720
 practiced for x years you have to be 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.940
 very precise because it is necessary that the 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.680
 jury imagine that they help you must 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.949
 that they imagine you watching 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.660
 a film like commisssion or like or 

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:30.000
 like i do not know me or like raging 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.019
 bull if we love niro precisely where he 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.129
 must they imagine you in the process of 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.680
 play badminton since you have 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:36.840
 the age of 7 or 8 years you really need 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.639
 give today d very hints 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.500
 precise about who you are and here I took 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:42.680
 the bottom of the resume but it's the same for the 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:46.139
 high of the cv if we take the course 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.209
 academic do not hesitate to specify 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:50.010
 the subjects in which one is good 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.660
 that is to say, we can very well say 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.739
 at a given moment when licensed 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:58.709
 of economics specialty macroeconomics of 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:00.720
 very good notions microeconomics it goes 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.720
 we need to tell the juries there 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.449
 is good where the face we love and that 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.159
 take a few short sentences 

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:09.810
 little words that can be put here and there 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:11.159
 that make all the difference in a CV 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.459
 advice on the substance and on the 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:13.169
 form 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.209
 on the end I think we have to go 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:17.280
 consult cv databases 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.820
 who are online today sites 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.770
 as moncv.com as doyoubuzz 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.300
 today referent in the field and 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:25.790
 I believe you can consult 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.290
 a lot of cv after I think it takes 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.270
 minimalist in form and especially 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:30.740
 no creativity of misplaced one 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.240
 do not introduce art schools on 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.600
 this not the architected schools 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.460
 we are in things very expected very 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.910
 classic takes four hours thanks for 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.910
 those advices
