00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.880
 Below you will find a patented innovation from Germany 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.509
 introduced the Flexity technology +4 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.880
 which stands for energy and Biedermann the table must 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:31.990
 after being in charge of orthopedics with Norbert Becker 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.990
 the biomechanics of flexible technology 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.930
 Feet are heavy workers 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.200
 With our feet, I literally stand for life and we walk 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.590
 with them through the Thunder 50 million steps that's four times around 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.160
 world 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.930
 Scientific studies prove that over 15 million Germans alone 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.920
 Joint complaints back and head complaints due to wrong 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.910
 Foot strains in the wrong or unstable shoe 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.850
 the natural form of walking is barefoot running 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.360
 an impression of the tram you can see the pressure distribution of the foot when 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.340
 Walking barefoot high pressure 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.380
 at the shipping appearance 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.690
 and in the middle of the leg handprint is normal and natural 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.550
 normal shoes often have a curved bottom in the bathing area of ​​the foot 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.930
 He touches it and then he comes close as in an alley 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.630
 since further use of it is written as well as its shape and needs up 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.280
 in extreme cases, then a hole in the brine in the middle of the pair that arises 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.950
 so-called Ken Loach 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.650
 the shoe is unstable and the foot unnaturally deformed the focus breaks 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.450
 by 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.900
 this results in a bad load to foot 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.260
 and, as a consequence, an incorrect loading of the whole body, the so-called medial 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.650
 instability 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.560
 With the flexible systems we have developed a solution to the problem 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.000
 gossamer if just some brine made of spring steel is longitudinal 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.860
 flexible 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.120
 and stable in the transverse direction 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.430
 It absorbs all forces that deform and damage the foot 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:02.170
 can 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.240
 on the surface DAX without the foot can roll four barefoot without the foot 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.699
 is deformed and the shoe wears off incorrectly 

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:13.529
 in a normal to soft shoe and the basler of the foot adapts to the 

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:16.969
 Underground collapses unnaturally and tilts 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:18.209
 prone 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.500
 The flexible existing stabilizes the forefoot and prevents the 

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:24.149
 Foot deformed 

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:28.109
 With the Flexi Texas themes, the shoe bottom is stable and yet remains 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:29.619
 flexible 

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:33.319
 you bring a punctual load in a shoe Una fetzig DAX is just 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.279
 The shoe weighs at this point 

00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:41.399
 with the omitted is the sole the work remains and deforms 

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:42.659
 Not 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:47.309
 the lower the deformation Scotia and the more stable the shoe is 

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:51.779
 Thus, the Flexity Xolar makes a treasure for the shoe and optimal 

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:54.009
 wear footprint 

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:57.869
 The Flexity Xolair is made with high quality spring steel 

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:59.519
 sloping waves 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.809
 the direction of the waves is modeled on the anatomy of the foot and at 77 degrees 

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:06.029
 shown on foot longitudinal axis 

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:10.639
 In the heel area, she then supports a rolling process without prying the foot 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:13.639
 here is the world in the direction of 103 wire rack 

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:20.289
 The Flexi Takata system stabilizes the shoe and supports the foot exactly 

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:24.149
 can be represented very well on an x-ray, the stand is stable and 

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:24.940
 for sure 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.190
 the sound is stable and safe its stability is guaranteed 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.179
 Schuba keeps his fit longer 

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:35.889
 All elements like attenuation and management Manta come in the shoe 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:37.269
 to better advantage 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.419
 and the school runs off as it should 

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:43.899
 Thus, the functionality of the shoe is significantly expanded 

00:03:45.249 --> 00:03:47.279
 the Flexity Classic II 

00:03:47.279 --> 00:03:51.969
 is designed primarily for schools with Lohse insole and is under 

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:56.169
 These are laid even with a very thin original insert 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:59.199
 The efficient few flexIT Act the usual wearing comfort 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:05.400
 the bio-brand Natascha has a component in this 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.400
 Son integrated high-quality neodymium magnets 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.949
 Bush and physics Nobel laureate Professor Werner Heisenberg knew 

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:18.769
 The magnetic energy is the elementary energy of the whole 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.459
 Life depends 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.590
 our health depends, among other factors, quite decisively on 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.199
 the nature of our blood vessels 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:31.199
 the circulation this supply to the whole organism 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.680
 with the vital oxygen and other important nutrients to the 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.919
 Removal of carbon dioxide and metabolic products 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.080
 the oxygen tent with the help of the red blood cells of the so-called something 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.770
 carried transported throughout the Bundestag run 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.229
 by a certain loss potential, they can each other too 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:52.749
 repel 

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:57.409
 These tensions prevent the reduced clumping and there is room 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:59.949
 stick to the vessel walls 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:03.030
 a major reason for the slowdown in cloud closure 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.580
 The so-called money is supposed to be red blood cell formation 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.310
 the ten rows are clumping together like we once had to 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:13.830
 World full of each other 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.789
 which leads to a reduction of their elasticity 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:20.229
 the consequence is circulatory disorders 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:24.020
 the education to acute and chronic impairment up to the 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.520
 Destruction of various kinds can lead to Felix functions 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:31.139
 this results in a wealth of diseases 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:35.800
 Throughout his life »2, Nippons are crucially influenced by the state of ours 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.939
 Blood vessels and our blood circulation 

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:42.959
 What positive influence did the energy have on the games? 

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:44.249
 Afford 

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:48.239
 she already considered organic foods are ours 

00:05:48.239 --> 00:05:49.479
 red blood cells 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:53.680
 what makes these in turn movable and the risk of clumping 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.479
 reduced 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:06:00.080
 The blood flow is thereby optimized and our body needs to be vital with me 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.150
 Oxygen that was 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.139
 Scientific profile food mainly support the assumption that the markets 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:10.039
 not everyone who has a favorable influence on flooding and cell metabolism 

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:13.839
 Of course, the personal experiences are crucial 

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:17.309
 in clinics and practices 

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:21.149
 The complex Body &amp; Shoot Concept is divided into the three areas 

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:23.289
 in front of body 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:24.759
 per show 

00:06:24.759 --> 00:06:27.360
 biomagnetic 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.729
 Homburger stands for 

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:30.849
 security 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:32.629
 natural movement 

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:33.930
 reliefs 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.409
 Performance gain and support function 

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:38.639
 research 

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:42.969
 stands for stability flexibility 

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:44.869
 integrity 

00:06:44.869 --> 00:06:47.869
 about those and feature enhancements 

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:52.379
 as important as a stable foundation for your house 

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:55.439
 is a stable creation for her body 

00:06:55.439 --> 00:06:59.479
 the many years of experience from my also the BDR between practice numerous 

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:01.460
 Research at the University 

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.439
 and the Institute for Applied Biomechanics in Tübingen 

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:07.849
 I was able to enter the multi-year development of the patented flexible 

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:09.089
 Bring in technology
