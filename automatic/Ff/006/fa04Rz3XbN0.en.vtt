 with this first of smartbooks I'm going to 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.369
 make sure my makeup last me 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.200
 all day the base that I will be 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.440
 using today is this 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.990
 revlon code stage web in color 320 la 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.550
 which I will apply on my whole face and 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.170
 good the imperfections that we have 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.229
 covered will be covered with this 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.789
 marx color corrector caster that the 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.509
 I really like it a lot because it 's 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:58.509
 for all 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.310
 and now with those dark circles and those areas 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.320
 red that had been covered I'm going to fix 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.320
 all with this translucent powder theme 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.650
 in the end 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.110
 uy but now I look like fantasy is 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.180
 time to give a little color to me 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.640
 skin and I'll start with this blush of 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.890
 16 jones formula in happy color and 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:28.350
 then I will give dimension to my face 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.350
 with this bronze one of venice 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.069
 and to return a little bit of 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.200
 luminosity to my face I will use 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.200
 this lancÃ´me illuminator 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.110
 and now we are going to move to the eyes and 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.630
 let's focus the camera 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.840
 more or less so first thing that I'm going to 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.520
 do is apply a timer state so that 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.010
 the shadows that apply later have 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.200
 something to adhere to I'll start with 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.420
 this shadow to the limit which is going to 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.610
 help make a transient shadow 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.560
 so that he throws that he applies afterwards he does not 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.110
 Notice where it starts and where 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.650
 they end no no it's a darker shade 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:09.550
 I put it in, I'm going to apply it 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.550
 concentrating on the fold 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.870
 going to factor and this shadow color 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.970
 dark that is going to be the darkest that 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:20.310
 let's apply this time I'm going to 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.310
 concentrate on the external ub of the eye 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.620
 and after blurring I'll take 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.990
 strange that is a vanilla shadow 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.550
 mate and I'm going to apply it in the arch of 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.550
 the eyebrows to give a little light 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.830
 you are my favorite shadow of the palette 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.819
 naked 3 and until I'm going to be applying 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.819
 in all the almond 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.270
 with this lighter pink shadow 2 I'm going 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:59.280
 to be carrying in the lacrimal to give 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.280
 a little more light and open my eyes 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.220
 going back to the 1 that was one of my 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.440
 transitory shadows I'll take it in 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.890
 the line of the lower lashes for 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.890
 remark 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.739
 going to the delineated I will use 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.840
 per version that is a super delineator 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.669
 black and I'm going to apply it inside of 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.519
 the line of the eyelashes and outside 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:24.009
 I'm going to apply these six in brown 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.440
 of the torch brand that although it is a pencil 

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:29.229
 chubby how can you see how it matches 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.780
 with this sponge it 's pretty easy to 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:34.270
 apply now after you have finished 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.460
 this is time to hook the tabs and 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.860
 you have them in jazz like me 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.320
 then we are going to apply about two or 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.360
 Three generous layers of mascara and lashes 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.949
 false if you have the eyelashes 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.949
 as short as me 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.830
 and from here to frame the look with the 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.770
 eyebrows obviously you have to define the 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:59.530
 fill them and shape them this I am 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:02.010
 doing with this anastasia pencil of 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.010
 religion 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.580
 and finally to finish our 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:13.650
 makeup I will be applying this 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.650
 gloss detroit in a pink color 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:25.450
 And now after settling in 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:25.450
 hair are ready to go for a walk 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.660
 well after this stadium finished 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.370
