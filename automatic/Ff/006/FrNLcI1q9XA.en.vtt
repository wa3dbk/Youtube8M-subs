00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.700
 listens loudly to the project manager but 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.590
 I receive house directly from 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.840
 stock while to keep me informed 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.090
 I'll try to make it simple 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.100
 and pall mall with me it's the little 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.960
 mozart talent at max I do not care that 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.800
 the box is bottle-fed 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.510
 and all studies 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.730
 even though this research program 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.880
 genetics of destinies from the beginning 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.890
 you must respect the hierarchy 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.910
 I respect it delgado it's just you 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.840
 I do not respect the fair made case 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.870
 until now I closed my mouth 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.640
 and it was nice this silence for 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.110
 the good of the company and despite my 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.820
 contempt for the little wearers of your tone 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.390
 species but if you do not change 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.390
 attitude 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.309
 I break you ray is super to the breakage to 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.390
 lamballe gado even you have to 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.010
 recognize that the project is good 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.840
 advanced 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.430
 obviously but we managed to 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.770
 upset the genetic structure of 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.730
 several animals and I even found 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.350
 an inspiration in culture 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:20.310
 popular of the last century 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.920
 like you, his name was spider man 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.240
 one of the founders of the air lock in 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.550
 the second half of the 20th century 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.780
 he had the proportional strength of a 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.730
 proportional analysis to what exactly 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.830
 proportional attack bullshit we 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.320
 want to create a European an operator to 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.420
 increased potential okay and well sees 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.180
 this potential natural adhesion to the wall 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.010
 able to lift up to 10 tons 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.650
 natural agility that's what we need 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.960
 but if we go too quickly in danger of 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.240
 fine and faster to lose en route 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.430
 yeah that's why we're progressing to 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.800
 small steps aside that we take care 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.930
 folder is full of pretty pictures 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.540
 a kind of only little gentlemen 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.010
 sorry to interrupt you sir 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.250
 stone it's been a long time 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.530
 sir such gift to reason h and max the 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.729
 alsh and max results can not 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.039
 wanting anything is a 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.200
 corporation not a person a 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.340
 hired person like the 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.420
 human volunteers who have the right 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.980
 to demand that all precautions 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.190
 be taken before we take them 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:23.000
 for guinea mike you know what you 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.950
 raymond scared if he was still alive 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.590
 help me out of 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.170
 coffin they would go that caution the 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.890
 rampart of the weak and this for a 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.920
 good reason 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:37.190
 because they drank because it's 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.140
 true and sir sips here present and 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.260
 all right do not tell me it's 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.630
 what I believe so mike instead of a 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.090
 artificial aging of 40 years in 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.830
 condemnation sir target of 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.590
 volunteers for the program at pea 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.820
 sir 6 we still have no 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.100
 idea of ​​the side effects of 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.380
 treatment on a human being in I am 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.670
 doubt the offer either you would have you 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.980
 look for your guinea pigs in the pond at 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.600
 condemned but I prefer to risk my 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.100
 life than to become slow addicted then 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.340
 do your best is all that 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.340
 everybody 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.240
 big mouth or no wind sir 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.940
 stock you crash you ahora if I had 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.470
 refused stone would have gone on without me and 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.200
 the sim video would have ended up between 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.330
 your hands delgado because to his chances 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:26.550
 to survive was between 0 and no 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:27.750
 so I had to accept but where and we 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.760
 let's try to replace your 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.230
 genetic structure by another we 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.120
 have several pre- programmed templates 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.190
 we will start with something 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.470
 simple just enough to make it stronger 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.540
 and why not here the word such thomas 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.400
 reign of which you speak is a thing to 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.840
 Delgado time I will not try to 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.340
 rewrite its entire structure while 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.050
 it's our first human guinea pig in 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.840
 could end up a horrible 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:54.959
 mutant monsters or even worse you good 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:56.600
 truce of gossiping maximum power the 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.310
 cabin design full of gifts 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.580
 I was inspired by a rape to the movie the 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.860
 fly 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.600
 you must like the stars of a guy 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.910
 turns into mouth to shit I could 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.800
 easily identify what are your good 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.690
 which will become crappy what 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.040
 is happening is afraid of losing any 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.470
 credibility and asks sir stone 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.450
 in the x 1c his touch and delgado 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.290
 I actually have the x's and because 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.290
 until then life of a human being 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.470
 ok opening 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.740
 sir sims always with us you 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:37.880
 should feel tingling but 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:47.930
 it'll go to oskou sir if he me 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:51.350
 I'm sorry to try it but and sir 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:53.810
 simon moore benn note that he has 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.130
 broken his shackles effortlessly for this 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.480
 which is the increase in strength 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.480
 it's very convincing
