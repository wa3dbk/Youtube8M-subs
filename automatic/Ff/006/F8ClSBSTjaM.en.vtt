00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.029
 hello dear friends today 

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:08.040
 talk about a competitive bunch then 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.010
 there aren't quite trench dreams and a bunch about how 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.900
 would make it faster for them to cube 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.599
 course matured know everything such 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.690
 comprehensive approach before you box here 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:22.650
 notice here is a box here is grass 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.449
 see there are no barrels worth 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.930
 from one of whom the other goes down and 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.689
 reveals what we see there also here 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.759
 open look the grass is for this 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.219
 so we had a microorganism this 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.129
 very important to have microorganisms 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.260
 we water this composition 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.989
 compost heaps right rush 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.430
 periodically from the fact that 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.340
 typed in the garden everything rushes 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.039
 rushes every time undermined here here 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.129
 these kudah bacteria take abark rick 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.699
 no need to take anisin there that appears 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.980
 it is important that the compost pile is not 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.500
 dries out how to achieve it well in my 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.960
 Here's tent is no wind here and 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.939
 and then there is no reason to apple growing mulberries, too 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.650
 Apple trees every two apples that is, I have 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.240
 there is no such climate after me 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.430
 dries but if it dries you need of course 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.659
 water it is not enough it is only 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.350
 bacteria so as they say only 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.570
 finish 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.930
 it is necessary to water the water and not to remove 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.310
 you so he will be well, about 30 grams 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.880
 10 liters of water 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.470
 water this given given fuel and 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.500
 we check for humidity here if i 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.750
 Now I will take my hand to the sun 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.030
 attention see what congress on 2 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.470
 porridge bye 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.720
 touch by the way so do not need anything 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.570
 in no case do not stir too 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.479
 only water pour out bacteria for 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.070
 so that the grass decomposes faster 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:47.700
 decomposed in order to eat the body 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.310
 so I have 8 compass amplified 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.119
 of course I can't explain everything today 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.070
 all options possible acceleration well here 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.719
 one of the options I told you which 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.090
 the disadvantage is just a very liquid 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.430
 it smells a lot and when you open it 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.170
 the smell must be in the mittens I do not 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.820
 just showed the bulbs because 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.920
 Stream at least five times in the bath 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.649
 the smell remains therefore puts on 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.770
 mittens and only heavily mittens here 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.590
 this liquid 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:18.130
 water the smell very much here 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:21.570
 the only flaw is that everything is clear yes 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.570
 we will pass another competition 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.890
 So please do not here's another body 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.410
 rocked you see you mother you see 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.870
 as one she is ready and that was all 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.330
 provotorova grass poison grass like this 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.570
 achieves kills 8 just now saw 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.490
 usually villas that is necessary constantly 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.250
 just on tilt and planet pick 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.530
 they say that go away kuyase pass 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.750
 to, too, the bacteria must be run which 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.910
 bacterium hour I can show those who 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.830
 were in the barrel we can atheists that is 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.830
 constantly constantly poking around that is 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:05.280
 then moves to that here, too, but that's 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.080
 see apples grow by please 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.120
 taxes here are platforms and here are barrels too 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.300
 there is also a set of compass paths 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.820
 see looking there pumpkins grow just here 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.860
 corn please and that's what it is 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.980
 this is the most interesting body tour 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.050
 before you start picking 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.450
 be sure to take something cover here 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.030
 In this case, I bent down 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.440
 Well, you can cover let's say mink 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.540
 coats if you certainly have no 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.280
 mink can of course be extended 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.110
 it is necessary why because 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.299
 cross section will run away 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.610
 worms do not tolerate them at all 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:43.000
 touching this unique creation 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:45.640
 they start to scatter and therefore their 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.019
 need to cover throw a rag or here 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.560
 carbon in this case 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:52.450
 in a flat but something we have to throw 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.790
 remember that something needs to be given 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.709
 I dropped the case and put it every time 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.540
 there is food that is watering 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.630
 and put food put food cat 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.580
 seas that are those that were worms like me 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.340
 began to pick here that is movement here 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:09.340
 these started they run away here 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.680
 they pay attention here as well if 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.560
 it does not make them run a chick for 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.090
 every worm must fight well 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:22.049
 the case of combs can already have to plant 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:22.049
 please move further 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:28.330
 here's one more oblique pile 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.810
 itself on this here this so-called 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.470
 here rand oh how nice it smells 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.280
 mustard 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:39.159
 look all interesting and note here 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:42.460
 Mustard tomato grows together did not know 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:44.710
 even this here is also an old explanatory 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.590
 manure which is not in front of the front is not the same 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:50.560
 garbage icons I folded everything leveled 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.720
 Here such a box means and planted hot 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.840
 this mustard he mustard went 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:58.060
 By the way, I also watered this solution 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.159
 To microbe run as they say here 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.530
 now Iâ€™ll sort of mow her and 

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:04.389
 new layer but its this that is it will be 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.990
 put a new layer on a new layer 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:10.300
 layer that is i will be proud to mow 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.780
 plant again and again with your pal 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.090
 is said 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.520
 impose then there is this contest 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.400
 can back overlap then 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.680
 there is a bunch going to grow by fall 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:23.469
 due again these bacteria will 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.780
 multiply so clear yes here's another 

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:28.599
 that is, this kind of course could 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:30.909
 something useful to plant like this one 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:32.830
 as kensu is admissible or is admissible there 

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:34.840
 cress and so on basil 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.669
 Well, I decided so here I will 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.979
 mowing the porridge troops waited until 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:40.930
 September volume when found from which 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:42.880
 rises like this you burn it 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.940
 closes if the lord is closed that is 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.349
 rate of growth 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:50.669
 increases like that due to this 

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:54.250
 construction tt black nekopara let 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:57.849
 knife, you see what time is how 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:06:00.039
 pay attention here and was already 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:02.830
 the earth is also a kind of coke on course 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:05.680
 that is, there was corn grass growing 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:08.199
 this grass breaks down a bad thing 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:11.580
 ground and it was all right to give so 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:11.580
 residues remnants of them
