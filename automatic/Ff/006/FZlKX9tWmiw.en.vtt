00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
to tune down to D you can't pick it up

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.630 
to tune down to D you can't pick it up
whichever<00:00:53.660> this<00:00:54.660> right<00:00:55.260> here<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.039> tuning<00:00:56.430> key

going to be fooling with if the guitar
is<00:01:00.210> already<00:01:00.510> in<00:01:00.570> tune<00:01:01.340> you<00:01:02.340> can<00:01:02.550> take<00:01:02.820> your

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
is already in tune you can take your

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.320 
is already in tune you can take your
fourth<00:01:03.719> string<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:05.210> hit<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.420> string<00:01:07.310> and

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
fourth string and hit that string and

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.030 
fourth string and hit that string and
then<00:01:09.330> you'll<00:01:09.479> take<00:01:09.720> your<00:01:09.840> six<00:01:10.200> string<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.710> hit

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
then you'll take your six string and hit

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:22.670 
then you'll take your six string and hit
that<00:01:11.220> string<00:01:11.750> and<00:01:12.750> actually<00:01:13.680> detune<00:01:14.369> it

it comes close it's going to have a
wavering<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:06.930> can<00:02:07.050> hear<00:02:07.200> I<00:02:07.940> like<00:02:08.940> that<00:02:09.090> you'll

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
wavering you can hear I like that you'll

wavering you can hear I like that you'll
hear<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:10.110> you'll<00:02:10.500> get<00:02:10.679> slower<00:02:11.280> and

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
hear that and you'll get slower and

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.880 
hear that and you'll get slower and
slower<00:02:11.790> you<00:02:12.000> get<00:02:12.180> closer<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:14.390> what<00:02:15.390> would<00:02:15.959> you

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
slower you get closer to what would you

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.530 
slower you get closer to what would you
want<00:02:17.130> to<00:02:17.220> get<00:02:17.459> it<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:17.700> where<00:02:17.850> is<00:02:17.970> no<00:02:18.150> wavering

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
want to get it to where is no wavering

want to get it to where is no wavering
if<00:02:18.690> you<00:02:18.810> go<00:02:18.959> past<00:02:21.470> it'll<00:02:22.470> start<00:02:22.709> up<00:02:22.860> again

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
if you go past it'll start up again

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.380 
if you go past it'll start up again
let's<00:02:23.400> start<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.670> wave<00:02:23.820> that's<00:02:24.060> about<00:02:24.270> the

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
let's start the wave that's about the

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.150 
let's start the wave that's about the
best<00:02:24.510> way<00:02:24.690> I<00:02:24.720> can<00:02:24.810> explain<00:02:24.930> it<00:02:25.230> with<00:02:25.500> my<00:02:25.650> my

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
best way I can explain it with my my

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.830 
best way I can explain it with my my
mouth<00:02:26.370> is<00:02:26.730> pretty<00:02:27.090> much<00:02:27.180> what<00:02:27.360> it<00:02:27.450> sounds<00:02:27.480> like

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
mouth is pretty much what it sounds like

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.020 
mouth is pretty much what it sounds like
so<00:02:28.170> let's<00:02:28.920> go<00:02:29.100> ahead<00:02:29.130> and<00:02:29.340> we'll<00:02:29.640> do<00:02:29.820> it<00:02:29.910> one

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
so let's go ahead and we'll do it one

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.140 
so let's go ahead and we'll do it one
more<00:02:30.150> time<00:02:30.739> and<00:02:31.739> I'm<00:02:31.830> going<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:32.010> try<00:02:32.130> to<00:02:32.160> do

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
more time and I'm going to try to do

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.610 
more time and I'm going to try to do
like<00:02:33.330> this<00:02:33.570> I<00:02:33.780> should<00:02:34.019> kind<00:02:34.260> of<00:02:34.320> show<00:02:34.440> you<00:02:34.500> the

like this I should kind of show you the

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.260 
like this I should kind of show you the
wavering

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:49.070

I<00:02:52.800> know<00:02:53.520> it's<00:02:53.730> probably<00:02:53.880> hard<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.330> hear

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
I know it's probably hard to hear

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:55.850 
I know it's probably hard to hear

go right above the 7th fret and i don't
mean<00:03:17.400> actually<00:03:17.850> pressing<00:03:18.150> down<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:18.600> string

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840

the fret we just want to touch it very
slightly<00:03:35.190> we<00:03:35.940> can<00:03:36.150> hit<00:03:36.600> it<00:03:36.830> to<00:03:37.830> create<00:03:38.100> a

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
slightly we can hit it to create a

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.900 
slightly we can hit it to create a
remind<00:03:38.550> we<00:03:39.090> actually<00:03:39.630> pick<00:03:39.870> that<00:03:40.560> string<00:03:41.010> to

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
remind we actually pick that string to

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.480 
remind we actually pick that string to

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.490 
create a harmonic what you do is you hit

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.110 
create a harmonic what you do is you hit
it<00:03:44.610> first<00:03:44.970> and<00:03:45.870> then<00:03:45.900> let<00:03:46.500> your<00:03:46.620> finger<00:03:46.980> off

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
enough to touch the fret and you know

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.360 
enough to touch the fret and you know
the<00:04:21.780> trick<00:04:22.109> is<00:04:22.350> you<00:04:22.620> want<00:04:22.800> both<00:04:23.039> of<00:04:23.100> the

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
the trick is you want both of the

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.279 
the trick is you want both of the
strings<00:04:23.760> to<00:04:24.000> be<00:04:24.150> ringing<00:04:24.510> at<00:04:24.630> the<00:04:24.660> same<00:04:24.780> time

strings to be ringing at the same time

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:27.529 
strings to be ringing at the same time
so<00:04:26.039> I<00:04:26.070> like<00:04:26.310> to<00:04:26.430> start<00:04:26.639> on<00:04:26.910> the<00:04:27.030> lowest<00:04:27.330> ring

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:27.539 
so I like to start on the lowest ring

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:30.590 
so I like to start on the lowest ring
