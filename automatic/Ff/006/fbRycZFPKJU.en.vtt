we's<00:00:00.539> go<00:00:00.750> when<00:00:00.900> I<00:00:00.989> guess<00:00:01.230> is<00:00:01.500> Wafi<00:00:01.860> here<00:00:02.070> and<00:00:02.220> I

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
we's go when I guess is Wafi here and I

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:11.959 
we's go when I guess is Wafi here and I
have<00:00:02.490> the<00:00:02.700> somnium<00:00:03.210> odd<00:00:10.340> now<00:00:11.340> as<00:00:11.460> I<00:00:11.550> said<00:00:11.610> I<00:00:11.820> do

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
have the somnium odd now as I said I do

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.730 
have the somnium odd now as I said I do
have<00:00:12.269> to<00:00:12.420> solve<00:00:12.660> you<00:00:12.870> but<00:00:13.080> you<00:00:13.320> guys<00:00:13.440> might<00:00:13.710> be

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
as you see with a 64 stack of iron ore

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.250 
as you see with a 64 stack of iron ore
in<00:00:25.500> each<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.949> these<00:00:26.039> eight<00:00:26.340> furnaces<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.260> how

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260

is<00:00:57.000> running<00:00:57.270> at<00:00:57.390> right<00:00:57.570> now<00:00:57.690> it's<00:00:57.840> at<00:00:57.960> one

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
is running at right now it's at one

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.130 
is running at right now it's at one
point<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:59.070> went<00:00:59.760> up<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.910> like<00:01:00.149> 50<00:01:00.629> 40<00:01:00.870> to

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
point to you I went up to like 50 40 to

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.889 
point to you I went up to like 50 40 to
50<00:01:01.500> times<00:01:01.879> my<00:01:02.879> test<00:01:03.180> earlier<00:01:03.539> but<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:03.719> guess

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
50 times my test earlier but I guess

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.690 
50 times my test earlier but I guess
because<00:01:04.049> I'm<00:01:04.260> recording<00:01:04.439> this<00:01:05.369> is<00:01:05.460> using<00:01:05.640> a

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
because I'm recording this is using a

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.370 
because I'm recording this is using a
little<00:01:05.790> bit<00:01:05.909> more<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.390> my<00:01:06.479> CPU<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.049> it's<00:01:07.200> not

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
little bit more of my CPU and it's not

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.310 
little bit more of my CPU and it's not
going<00:01:07.619> up<00:01:07.830> at<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.520> fast<00:01:08.850> but<00:01:09.119> let's<00:01:09.600> just

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
going up at that fast but let's just

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.160 
going up at that fast but let's just
leave<00:01:10.619> our<00:01:10.830> bed<00:01:11.070> now<00:01:11.340> let's<00:01:12.270> check<00:01:12.450> this<00:01:12.659> look

heater<00:01:28.770> both<00:01:29.369> simulating<00:01:30.060> Bob's<00:01:30.600> outside<00:01:31.170> as

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
heater both simulating Bob's outside as

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.649 
heater both simulating Bob's outside as
well<00:01:31.650> so<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.520> wasn't<00:01:32.820> just<00:01:32.850> like<00:01:33.060> simulating

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
well so it wasn't just like simulating

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.109 
well so it wasn't just like simulating
smelting<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.229> all<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.579> Mota<00:01:35.579> yeah<00:01:35.759> this<00:01:36.000> is

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119
