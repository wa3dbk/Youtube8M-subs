00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:23.530
 called from mexico exact and it's by 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.170
 creativity because it is from mexico 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:28.120
 and then here we will talk about cake pop and 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.250
 of also some other thing and of 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.910
 Japanese and to open our first 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.650
 Blog 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.880
 let's talk about the difference 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.800
 between the two 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.990
 Japanese artists that artists 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.850
 Koreans now first we're going to go 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.160
 up and down the differences between 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.870
 the Korean artists and the bell the 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.390
 difference between the hair of the 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.240
 japanese and the japanese koreans ni 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.160
 they even touch their hair at least and do not 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.080
 There will also be a plate ready but not 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.910
 only in china is my daughter lotina already 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.560
 difference of the Korean ones is that she 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:01.490
 It has been used much the dryer to the 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:03.890
 iron and those who have them 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.380
 a very particular style to get ready 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.510
 it's like that very exotic very extravagant 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:13.370
 very unique and the coordinates are like more 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:18.670
 western with that is very big very 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:28.450
 great that the Koreans use more 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:28.450
 discreet accessories makeup 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.770
 the Japanese are more natural and as 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:37.740
 that all natural and more innocent 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:42.229
 if these koreans are more like that 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.229
 Make up more artificial buttons 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.789
 while the Japanese make their eyes 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.369
 the largest are the ones 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:53.159
 Korean lashes does not require anything 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:02:00.439
 false eyelashes eyeliners 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:02:00.439
 obviously but the koreans 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.130
 but it is a detail 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.549
 more innocent 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:26.280
 and the Korean ones that already more western 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:28.290
 then they do not have the neckline so they are 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.549
 from here but they can teach all 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.250
 the time then there are also the 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:38.470
 covers are already very very 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:41.390
 you want to enter the market 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.070
 American and the Japanese or the 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.380
 Japanese like they do not care so much 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.970
 another difference in the locker room is 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.010
 Long socks worn by artists 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.170
 Japanese that almost always they have and 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.340
 is in the fashion of the streets and in the 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.340
 music fashion 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.470
 they have hardly changed the style of 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:05.300
 Japanese music but the Korean one 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.300
 the Japanese have changed 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:14.000
 no more robotic with the mouth but 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.720
 good things that Japanese women do 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.480
 if you look at musical studies at 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.990
 less does this much to me while 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.990
 the Korean 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.819
 It's very interesting to see the 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.890
 difference between 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:42.620
 and between the music industry of 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.480
 capon and the music industry of the 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.910
 industry the music industry in 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.970
 chorea like 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:52.180
 and you already want to see more 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.740
 western I think that also 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.110
 has been a factor that has had more 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.870
 success and what's here 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.210
 more recently because japan the 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.240
 surprise in this father but not 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:08.520
 with so compatible or not so similar 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.520
 to the motion in america then 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.660
 people likes it 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.780

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.530
 to record fun things so 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:51.640

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:51.640
