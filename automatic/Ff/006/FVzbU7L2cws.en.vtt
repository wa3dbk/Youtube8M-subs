walk<00:00:00.599> me<00:00:00.780> through<00:00:00.960> the<00:00:01.050> Sinestro<00:00:02.300> it's

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
walk me through the Sinestro it's

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.999 
walk me through the Sinestro it's
basically<00:00:03.629> a<00:00:03.750> multi<00:00:04.110> boiler<00:00:04.440> machine<00:00:04.710> so

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
basically a multi boiler machine so

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.249 
basically a multi boiler machine so
you've<00:00:05.130> got<00:00:05.270> steam<00:00:06.270> boilers<00:00:06.629> of<00:00:06.810> better<00:00:07.020> back

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
you've got steam boilers of better back

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:08.620 
you've got steam boilers of better back
and

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:08.630 
and

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.990 
and
separate<00:00:09.470> people<00:00:09.860> exchanging<00:00:10.580> borders<00:00:10.880> in

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:11.000

of design they don't actually feel the

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.570 
of design they don't actually feel the
same<00:00:18.200> but<00:00:18.410> there<00:00:18.560> are<00:00:18.619> 58<00:00:18.920> million<00:00:19.220> in<00:00:19.460> the

basically<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.080> waterpark<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.650> cold<00:00:22.890> water

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
basically the waterpark is cold water

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.160 
basically the waterpark is cold water
comes<00:00:23.340> into<00:00:23.610> heat<00:00:24.119> exchangers<00:00:24.750> in<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.020> rear

comes into heat exchangers in the rear

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.249 
comes into heat exchangers in the rear
boiler<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:26.160> they<00:00:26.939> come<00:00:27.150> out<00:00:27.330> at<00:00:27.689> quite<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.170> high

coming<00:00:32.040> into<00:00:32.129> the<00:00:32.279> front<00:00:32.489> of<00:00:32.579> Orleans<00:00:32.879> is

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
coming into the front of Orleans is

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.990 
coming into the front of Orleans is
actually<00:00:33.629> higher<00:00:34.559> than<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:35.220> water<00:00:35.699> we're

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
actually higher than the water we're

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.570 
actually higher than the water we're
expecting<00:00:36.480> through<00:00:36.660> our<00:00:36.750> coffee<00:00:37.340> the<00:00:38.340> fact

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:38.580 
expecting through our coffee the fact

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.090 
expecting through our coffee the fact
that<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.970> that<00:00:39.210> means<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:40.760> generate<00:00:41.760> stay<00:00:42.059> a

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
that of that means you generate stay a

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.140 
that of that means you generate stay a
convection<00:00:44.100> current<00:00:44.430> within<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.820> boiler

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.150 
convection current within the boiler

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.299 
convection current within the boiler
which<00:00:45.330> basically<00:00:45.720> mixes<00:00:46.230> between<00:00:47.160> the

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
which basically mixes between the

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.030 
which basically mixes between the
elements<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.390> temperature<00:00:49.320> probe<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.890> the

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
elements the temperature probe and the

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.640 
elements the temperature probe and the
water<00:00:50.280> inlet<00:00:50.699> mixes<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.780> water<00:00:51.989> together<00:00:52.230> and

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:52.650 
water inlet mixes the water together and

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.740 
water inlet mixes the water together and
disperses<00:00:53.220> the<00:00:53.390> temperature<00:00:54.390> throughout<00:00:54.629> the

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
disperses the temperature throughout the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.890 
disperses the temperature throughout the
whole<00:00:54.930> boiler<00:00:55.799> and<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.729> gives<00:00:56.970> us<00:00:57.239> the

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:57.900 
whole boiler and that gives us the

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.320 
whole boiler and that gives us the
ability<00:00:58.019> to<00:00:58.589> have<00:00:58.739> plus<00:00:59.220> minus<00:00:59.519> point<00:00:59.850> five<00:01:00.150> of

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:00.330 
ability to have plus minus point five of

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.700 
ability to have plus minus point five of
the<00:01:00.420> degree

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
the degree

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.320

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
length of the entire shot so basically

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.300 
length of the entire shot so basically
the<00:01:08.610> machine<00:01:08.880> has<00:01:09.060> an<00:01:09.240> incredibly<00:01:10.310> stable

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
the machine has an incredibly stable

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.270 
the machine has an incredibly stable
temperature<00:01:12.150> which<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:12.900> absolutely<00:01:13.530> key<00:01:14.040> to

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
temperature which is absolutely key to

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.880 
temperature which is absolutely key to
making<00:01:14.640> good<00:01:14.909> coffee<00:01:15.560> tell<00:01:16.560> me<00:01:16.680> about<00:01:16.770> the

making good coffee tell me about the

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.300 
making good coffee tell me about the
pump<00:01:17.240> okay<00:01:18.240> so<00:01:18.300> each<00:01:18.780> there's<00:01:19.619> two<00:01:20.040> different

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
pump okay so each there's two different

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.800 
pump okay so each there's two different
types<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.759> machine<00:01:21.030> you've<00:01:21.180> got<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.300> single<00:01:21.540> pop

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
types of machine you've got a single pop

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.190 
types of machine you've got a single pop
machine<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.440> that<00:01:22.470> put<00:01:22.770> both<00:01:23.390> both<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:25.020> the

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
machine so that put both both of the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.710 
machine so that put both both of the
boilers<00:01:25.619> are<00:01:25.649> supplied<00:01:26.220> by<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.460> same<00:01:26.790> pump<00:01:27.030> we

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
boilers are supplied by the same pump we

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.930 
boilers are supplied by the same pump we
have<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.050> Hydra<00:01:28.530> win<00:01:28.680> each<00:01:28.979> machine<00:01:29.310> has<00:01:29.550> its

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
have the Hydra win each machine has its

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.080 
have the Hydra win each machine has its
own<00:01:30.170> so<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.200> can<00:01:31.409> set<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.740> pressure

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
own so you can set the pressure

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.340 
own so you can set the pressure
individually

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350

nice so you've got your brew brutal
gauge<00:01:47.890> and<00:01:48.190> pressure<00:01:48.820> gauge<00:01:49.140> steam<00:01:50.140> put<00:01:50.380> the

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
gauge and pressure gauge steam put the

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.080 
gauge and pressure gauge steam put the
steam<00:01:50.770> pressure<00:01:51.430> is<00:01:51.670> controlled<00:01:51.790> by

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
steam pressure is controlled by

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.510 
steam pressure is controlled by
temperature<00:01:52.570> as<00:01:53.500> opposed<00:01:53.800> to<00:01:53.980> a<00:01:54.010> mechanical

temperature as opposed to a mechanical
pressure<00:01:54.730> stat<00:01:55.060> so<00:01:55.930> you<00:01:55.990> basically<00:01:56.200> set<00:01:56.710> the

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
pressure stat so you basically set the

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.170 
pressure stat so you basically set the
temperature<00:01:57.130> of<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:57.460> rear<00:01:57.580> boiler<00:01:57.970> and<00:01:58.120> it

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
temperature of the rear boiler and it

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.310 
temperature of the rear boiler and it
maintains<00:01:58.570> pressure<00:01:59.190> depending

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.380 

Oh
