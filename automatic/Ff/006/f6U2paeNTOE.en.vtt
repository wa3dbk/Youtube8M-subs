00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
and that's something that would be

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.800 
and that's something that would be
really<00:02:03.310> hard<00:02:03.520> on<00:02:03.610> a<00:02:03.700> web<00:02:03.850> page<00:02:03.880> and<00:02:04.330> having<00:02:04.720> to

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
that locally and that's that's fun for

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.000 
that locally and that's that's fun for

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
of the the I padam you've played with

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.840 
of the the I padam you've played with
that<00:02:14.110> it's<00:02:14.230> it's<00:02:14.380> it's<00:02:15.010> really<00:02:15.280> cool<00:02:15.459> to<00:02:15.520> have

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
that it's it's it's really cool to have

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.610 
that it's it's it's really cool to have
a<00:02:15.880> touchscreen<00:02:16.120> and<00:02:16.600> to<00:02:16.690> be<00:02:16.810> able<00:02:16.900> when<00:02:17.470> you're

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
a touchscreen and to be able when you're

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.020 
a touchscreen and to be able when you're
when<00:02:17.890> you're<00:02:17.980> investigating<00:02:18.520> when<00:02:18.910> you're

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
when you're investigating when you're

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.910 
when you're investigating when you're
exploring<00:02:19.300> stuff<00:02:19.660> it's<00:02:19.810> kind<00:02:19.870> of<00:02:20.050> naturally

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
exploring stuff it's kind of naturally

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.620 
exploring stuff it's kind of naturally
lose<00:02:21.130> your<00:02:21.280> hands<00:02:21.459> and<00:02:21.670> so<00:02:21.850> I<00:02:22.090> think<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.360> ipad

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
lose your hands and so I think the ipad

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.360 
lose your hands and so I think the ipad
lends<00:02:22.870> itself<00:02:23.110> to<00:02:23.230> that<00:02:23.320> move<00:02:23.590> on<00:02:23.860> this<00:02:24.070> just

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
lends itself to that move on this just

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.070 
lends itself to that move on this just
bright<00:02:24.700> gorgeous<00:02:25.000> screen<00:02:25.450> is<00:02:25.720> something<00:02:25.989> this
