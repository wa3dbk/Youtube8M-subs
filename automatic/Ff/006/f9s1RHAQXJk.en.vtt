you're probably wondering you know how
do<00:00:16.020> I<00:00:16.110> pressure<00:00:16.380> foot<00:00:16.650> so<00:00:17.400> as<00:00:17.760> you<00:00:17.820> can<00:00:18.150> see<00:00:18.360> i'm

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
do I pressure foot so as you can see i'm

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.970 
do I pressure foot so as you can see i'm
not<00:00:18.689> really<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:18.900> best<00:00:18.960> this<00:00:19.349> trick<00:00:19.650> but<00:00:19.950> i

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
not really the best this trick but i

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.830 
not really the best this trick but i
want<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.430> make<00:00:20.580> a<00:00:20.640> little<00:00:21.000> tutorial<00:00:21.330> on<00:00:21.689> the

want to make a little tutorial on the

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.200 
want to make a little tutorial on the
process<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.380> how<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.560> do<00:00:22.800> it<00:00:22.950> because<00:00:23.910> i<00:00:23.939> found

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
process and how to do it because i found

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.490 
process and how to do it because i found
lots<00:00:24.390> of<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.570> trick<00:00:24.750> tips<00:00:24.900> out<00:00:25.020> there<00:00:25.200> didn't

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
lots of the trick tips out there didn't

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.200 
lots of the trick tips out there didn't
really<00:00:25.650> help<00:00:25.829> so<00:00:26.640> i'm<00:00:26.700> just<00:00:26.759> going<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.029> cover

really help so i'm just going to cover

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.839 
really help so i'm just going to cover
feudal<00:00:27.660> basics<00:00:28.140> now<00:00:28.919> there's<00:00:29.369> two<00:00:29.520> ways<00:00:29.610> to<00:00:29.669> do

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
feudal basics now there's two ways to do

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.040 
feudal basics now there's two ways to do
this<00:00:29.880> trick<00:00:30.119> you<00:00:30.329> can<00:00:30.390> sort<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.720> do<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:30.960> the

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
this trick you can sort of do it the

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.889 
this trick you can sort of do it the
horizontal<00:00:31.739> way<00:00:31.890> like<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:32.610> or<00:00:33.300> you<00:00:33.570> can<00:00:33.750> do

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
horizontal way like that or you can do

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.799 
horizontal way like that or you can do
it<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.860> vertical<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.489> if<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.149> know<00:00:36.239> extent<00:00:36.660> is

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
it the vertical it if I know extent is

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.479 
it the vertical it if I know extent is
the<00:00:36.989> vertical<00:00:37.200> way<00:00:37.470> of<00:00:37.590> pop<00:00:37.770> shove-it<00:00:38.190> because

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
the vertical way of pop shove-it because

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.670 
the vertical way of pop shove-it because
the<00:00:38.610> back<00:00:38.790> side<00:00:39.090> pop<00:00:39.300> shove<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.780> vertical

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
the back side pop shove it vertical

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.380 
the back side pop shove it vertical
feels<00:00:41.040> like<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.820> doesn't<00:00:41.879> have<00:00:42.269> that

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
feels like that it doesn't have that

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.240 
feels like that it doesn't have that
little<00:00:42.570> twist<00:00:42.899> motion<00:00:43.350> which<00:00:43.920> will<00:00:44.070> make<00:00:44.190> it

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
little twist motion which will make it

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.950 
little twist motion which will make it
the<00:00:44.460> pressure<00:00:44.699> foot<00:00:45.260> so<00:00:46.260> anyways<00:00:47.239> now<00:00:48.239> first

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
the pressure foot so anyways now first

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.799 
the pressure foot so anyways now first
step<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:50.280> got<00:00:50.429> to<00:00:50.460> figure<00:00:50.730> out<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.780> know

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
step is you got to figure out you know

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.779 
step is you got to figure out you know
what's<00:00:51.929> my<00:00:52.469> best<00:00:52.679> pressure<00:00:52.949> flip<00:00:53.280> position

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
what's my best pressure flip position

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.119 
what's my best pressure flip position
what<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:54.690> found<00:00:54.989> what<00:00:55.289> works<00:00:55.499> and<00:00:55.620> doesn't<00:00:55.710> work

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
what I found what works and doesn't work

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.509 
what I found what works and doesn't work
is<00:00:56.719> too<00:00:57.719> much<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:58.140> off<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.649> deck<00:00:58.859> doesn't

00:00:59.509 --> 00:00:59.519 
is too much you off the deck doesn't

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:02.810 
is too much you off the deck doesn't
work<00:01:00.409> because<00:01:01.409> sort<00:01:01.980> of<00:01:02.070> when<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.280> pop<00:01:02.519> down

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
work because sort of when you pop down

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.210 
work because sort of when you pop down
you<00:01:03.690> might<00:01:03.839> sort<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.230> just<00:01:04.409> drag<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.769> little<00:01:05.100> bit

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
you might sort of just drag a little bit

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.550 
you might sort of just drag a little bit
behind<00:01:05.610> or<00:01:06.570> it's<00:01:06.750> just<00:01:06.780> harder<00:01:07.170> because<00:01:07.350> you

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
behind or it's just harder because you

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.260 
behind or it's just harder because you
don't<00:01:07.710> have<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:08.010> much<00:01:08.190> towing<00:01:08.940> the<00:01:09.000> boards

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
don't have that much towing the boards

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.840 
don't have that much towing the boards
you<00:01:09.390> can't<00:01:09.600> really<00:01:09.780> do<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.110> whole<00:01:10.260> kick<00:01:10.530> I

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
you can't really do the whole kick I

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.289 
you can't really do the whole kick I
make<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:11.970> flip<00:01:12.500> so<00:01:13.670> what<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:14.700> found<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.119> works

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
make it flip so what I found that works

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.780 
make it flip so what I found that works
the<00:01:15.420> best<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:16.040> if<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.159> have<00:01:17.310> all<00:01:17.460> my<00:01:17.490> weight<00:01:17.759> on

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
the best is if I have all my weight on

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.560 
the best is if I have all my weight on
my<00:01:17.939> toe<00:01:18.090> my<00:01:18.720> big<00:01:18.930> one<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.850> I<00:01:20.850> put<00:01:21.119> that<00:01:21.270> in<00:01:21.450> the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
my toe my big one and I put that in the

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.620 
my toe my big one and I put that in the
little<00:01:21.750> niche<00:01:21.899> here<00:01:22.140> like<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.950> little<00:01:23.189> dip

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
little niche here like the little dip

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.929 
little niche here like the little dip
with<00:01:24.630> not<00:01:24.810> too<00:01:24.990> much<00:01:25.079> hanging<00:01:25.439> over<00:01:25.560> at<00:01:26.280> about

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
with not too much hanging over at about

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.709 
with not too much hanging over at about
a<00:01:26.969> 45<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:28.439> when<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.590> pop<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.149> can<00:01:30.149> sort<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.479> push

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:30.719 
a 45 so when I pop it I can sort of push

a 45 so when I pop it I can sort of push
it<00:01:30.899> and<00:01:32.719> line<00:01:33.719> back<00:01:33.930> on<00:01:34.110> my<00:01:34.200> deck<00:01:34.670> now<00:01:35.689> another

to do is put in the middle and off sorta

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.039 
to do is put in the middle and off sorta
to<00:01:53.219> the<00:01:53.340> side<00:01:53.579> for<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:54.090> couple<00:01:54.329> reasons<00:01:54.359> one

easy<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:57.960> get<00:01:58.140> up<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.530> out<00:01:58.649> of<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.829> way<00:01:59.070> as

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
easy to get up and out of the way as

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.469 
easy to get up and out of the way as
well<00:02:00.090> as<00:02:01.250> if<00:02:02.250> you<00:02:02.369> have<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.640> too<00:02:02.820> much<00:02:03.000> on<00:02:03.240> it

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
well as if you have it too much on it

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.029 
well as if you have it too much on it
could<00:02:03.960> sort<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.229> prevent<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.649> board<00:02:04.890> from

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
could sort of prevent the board from

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:06.380 
could sort of prevent the board from
flipping<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.549> know<00:02:05.640> like<00:02:05.789> it'll<00:02:06.000> come<00:02:06.119> up<00:02:06.149> Oh

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
flipping you know like it'll come up Oh

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.180 
flipping you know like it'll come up Oh
stops<00:02:07.109> does<00:02:07.619> it<00:02:07.679> shove<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.070> on<00:02:08.160> you<00:02:08.310> so<00:02:10.190> the

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
stops does it shove it on you so the

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.760 
stops does it shove it on you so the
next<00:02:11.370> reason<00:02:11.640> why<00:02:11.970> is<00:02:12.240> because<00:02:13.050> when<00:02:13.380> you<00:02:13.470> pop

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
next reason why is because when you pop

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.620 
next reason why is because when you pop
it<00:02:14.040> you're<00:02:14.760> going<00:02:14.880> to<00:02:14.940> want<00:02:15.120> to<00:02:15.180> lean<00:02:15.360> back<00:02:15.570> a

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
little bit and it's hard to mean back

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.490 
little bit and it's hard to mean back

a little bit sideways and jump a little
bit<00:02:59.790> sideways<00:03:00.320> because<00:03:01.320> it's<00:03:01.860> quite<00:03:02.070> hard<00:03:02.280> to

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
bit sideways because it's quite hard to

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.190 
bit sideways because it's quite hard to

straight straight up like as you notice
I<00:03:05.910> do<00:03:05.970> mind<00:03:06.270> kind<00:03:06.420> of<00:03:06.540> vertical<00:03:06.989> but<00:03:07.920> I<00:03:08.340> still

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
I do mind kind of vertical but I still

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.340 
I do mind kind of vertical but I still
sort<00:03:09.450> of<00:03:09.510> do<00:03:09.630> it<00:03:09.720> to<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:09.930> side<00:03:10.200> and<00:03:12.350> just

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
sort of do it to the side and just

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.430 
sort of do it to the side and just
another<00:03:13.709> problem<00:03:14.100> that<00:03:14.340> you<00:03:15.330> might<00:03:15.440> actually

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
another problem that you might actually

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.500 
another problem that you might actually
a<00:03:16.620> problem<00:03:16.920> you<00:03:16.980> might<00:03:17.100> have<00:03:17.310> because<00:03:18.090> I<00:03:18.360> was

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
a problem you might have because I was

a problem you might have because I was
just<00:03:18.630> explaining<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.290> flip<00:03:19.500> but<00:03:19.680> anyways<00:03:19.950> so

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
just explaining the flip but anyways so

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.820 
just explaining the flip but anyways so
probably<00:03:20.730> you<00:03:20.820> might<00:03:20.940> have<00:03:21.120> is<00:03:21.590> if<00:03:22.590> you<00:03:22.800> are

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
probably you might have is if you are

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.479 
probably you might have is if you are
doing<00:03:23.270> pop<00:03:24.270> shuvit<00:03:24.600> now<00:03:25.500> as<00:03:25.830> I<00:03:26.100> explained

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
earlier because you have too much foot

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.890 
earlier because you have too much foot
or<00:03:28.320> if<00:03:28.920> it<00:03:29.040> could<00:03:29.459> be<00:03:29.610> because<00:03:29.730> you're<00:03:30.330> popping

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900
