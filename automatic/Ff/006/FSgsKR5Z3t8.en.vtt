00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:03.850
 journalists were invited to come and watch and listen this afternoon 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.280
 to the plans of the Dutch businessman van der must 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.540
 he showed recordings of the huge nuclear power plant going to buy doors 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:15.110
 amusement park wants to make it like it doesn't exist in the whole world 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.409
 firstly very large 

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:23.259
 nice location 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:26.079
 if you buy the full 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:29.909
 I am my background is a little hardware store trader hands trader 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:31.869
 there is a lot of trade in between 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.320
 yes then it has been extremely suitable for years 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.240
 kalkers a village in germany just across the border with the netherlands 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.630
 30 years ago it was decided to build a large nuclear power plant there 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.330
 most modern in europe 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.670
 that should supply electricity to the companies and 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.670
 thousands of families in the wider area 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.950
 from the outset, protests were made against the construction of the 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.060
 nuclear power plant 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.110
 far too dangerous for the environment and for the people who live nearby 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.540
 thought the campaigners 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.540
 they demanded 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.460
 Germany is one of three seedorf banks 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.460
 the film will attract that the figures show 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.840
 activists asked the court to ban the nuclear power plant 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.450
 and that finally happened 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.760
 Perez never made a crowbar of electricity 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.760
 but in the meantime it had become the most expensive building in europe 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.530
 demolishing the whole thing again that would cost a lot more money and therefore searched 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.280
 the owner to another destination and he has now found that thanks to the 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.280
 Dutch businessman van der must 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.480
 what the intention is to partially power the nuclear power plant 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.440
 on the view that proves that being able to see what I can shine 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.650
 has therefore been certain pieces 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.270
 will take care the symbols 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.499
 the rest will be the amusement park where everything revolves around water 

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:55.900
 so something went wrong 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.900
 a water slide in the main building 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.049
 a wave pool 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.030
 that comes from having to come 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.030
 percy cup competition for white water rafting 

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:14.159
 van der must has no doubt whether it is a great success for two congolese 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:16.859
 not just won what does not exist and 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:18.359
 And he did a success
