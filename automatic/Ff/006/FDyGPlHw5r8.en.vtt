Tory thought would be a really good
match<00:00:29.179> this<00:00:30.179> guitar<00:00:30.539> with<00:00:30.720> this<00:00:30.840> end<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.520> I'll

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
match this guitar with this end and I'll

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.069

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
start off playing with no effects just

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.920 
start off playing with no effects just
so<00:00:34.230> you<00:00:34.320> can<00:00:34.469> see<00:00:35.340> what<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.750> guitar<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:36.840> the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
so you can see what the guitar and the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.569 
so you can see what the guitar and the
amp<00:00:37.050> sounds<00:00:37.380> like<00:00:37.559> dry<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.670> just<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:40.579> volume

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
amp sounds like dry and just a volume

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.190 
amp sounds like dry and just a volume
two<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.030> half<00:00:42.239> or<00:00:42.450> something<00:00:42.719> like<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:42.899> so

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
two and a half or something like that so

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:53.690 
two and a half or something like that so
it's<00:00:43.290> not<00:00:43.410> really<00:00:43.680> driving

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:53.700 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.510

now<00:01:23.790> I'm<00:01:23.909> going<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.119> slowly<00:01:24.900> add<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.380> few<00:01:25.860> and

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
now I'm going to slowly add a few and

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.080 
now I'm going to slowly add a few and
effects<00:01:27.090> just<00:01:27.869> nothing<00:01:28.229> very<00:01:28.640> big<00:01:29.640> but<00:01:29.880> a

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
effects just nothing very big but a

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.990 
effects just nothing very big but a
little<00:01:30.600> bit<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.869> delay<00:01:31.170> I've<00:01:31.650> got<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.920> TC<00:01:32.369> delay

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
little bit of delay I've got a TC delay

formula<00:01:42.540> 5<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:43.740> add<00:01:44.100> those<00:01:44.399> one<00:01:44.670> by<00:01:44.850> one<00:01:45.229> to<00:01:46.229> see

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
formula 5 so add those one by one to see

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.690 
formula 5 so add those one by one to see
how<00:01:47.159> well<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:48.080> reacts<00:01:49.080> also<00:01:49.770> might<00:01:49.920> try<00:01:50.220> um<00:01:50.460> the

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
how well it reacts also might try um the

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.609 
how well it reacts also might try um the
different<00:01:51.030> pickup<00:01:51.330> positions<00:01:51.810> so<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.530> can

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
different pickup positions so you can

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.370 
different pickup positions so you can
see<00:01:52.920> what<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:53.430> like<00:01:53.700> with<00:01:54.240> this<00:01:54.420> combination<00:01:54.899> is

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
see what I like with this combination is

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.639 
see what I like with this combination is
there<00:01:55.619> it's<00:01:56.280> just<00:01:56.580> about<00:01:56.789> right<00:01:57.450> for<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.840> real

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
there it's just about right for a real

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.040 
there it's just about right for a real
sharp<00:01:59.610> brightness<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.270> cuts<00:02:00.539> through<00:02:00.630> or

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
sharp brightness that cuts through or

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.510 
sharp brightness that cuts through or
really<00:02:01.410> warm<00:02:03.080> richness<00:02:04.080> and<00:02:04.520> blending

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
really warm richness and blending

00:02:05.520 --> 00:03:46.880 
really warm richness and blending
between<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.910> two

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.580 

so<00:03:47.890> that<00:03:48.070> was<00:03:48.220> the<00:03:48.940> amp<00:03:49.090> all<00:03:49.360> on<00:03:49.660> about<00:03:49.900> volume

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
so that was the amp all on about volume

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.950 
so that was the amp all on about volume
two-and-a-half<00:03:51.460> just<00:03:52.420> going<00:03:52.600> through<00:03:52.690> my

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:52.960 
two-and-a-half just going through my

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.680 
two-and-a-half just going through my
various<00:03:53.110> pedals<00:03:53.790> just<00:03:54.790> giving<00:03:55.120> some<00:03:55.330> idea<00:03:55.660> of

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
various pedals just giving some idea of

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.010 
various pedals just giving some idea of
the<00:03:55.900> kind<00:03:56.080> of<00:03:56.190> sounds<00:03:57.190> I<00:03:57.280> can<00:03:57.460> get<00:03:57.900> the<00:03:58.900> other

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
the kind of sounds I can get the other

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.980 
the kind of sounds I can get the other
great<00:03:59.530> thing<00:03:59.740> with<00:03:59.890> this<00:04:00.040> amp<00:04:00.640> is<00:04:01.060> that<00:04:01.840> when

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:01.990 
great thing with this amp is that when

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:05.040 
great thing with this amp is that when
you<00:04:02.140> turn<00:04:03.100> it<00:04:03.310> up<00:04:03.490> it<00:04:03.880> drives<00:04:04.420> in<00:04:04.690> a<00:04:04.750> really

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
you turn it up it drives in a really

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.840 
you turn it up it drives in a really
really<00:04:05.410> nice<00:04:05.560> way<00:04:05.860> so<00:04:06.100> I'm<00:04:06.580> just<00:04:06.730> gonna

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
really nice way so I'm just gonna

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:57.800 
really nice way so I'm just gonna
demonstrate<00:04:07.120> that<00:04:07.600> now

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.050 

so<00:04:58.810> I<00:04:59.080> just<00:04:59.290> thought<00:04:59.440> I'd<00:04:59.820> show<00:05:00.820> another

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
so I just thought I'd show another

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.150 
so I just thought I'd show another
guitar<00:05:01.450> through<00:05:02.170> the<00:05:02.290> end<00:05:02.440> and<00:05:02.710> this<00:05:02.890> is<00:05:03.040> my

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
guitar through the end and this is my

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.170 
guitar through the end and this is my
new<00:05:03.390> custom<00:05:04.390> shop<00:05:04.920> and<00:05:05.920> it's<00:05:06.460> an<00:05:06.580> Esquire<00:05:06.970> but

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
new custom shop and it's an Esquire but

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.290 
new custom shop and it's an Esquire but
really<00:05:07.510> it's<00:05:07.630> a<00:05:07.750> Telecaster<00:05:08.380> and<00:05:09.160> of<00:05:10.060> course

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
really it's a Telecaster and of course

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.630 
really it's a Telecaster and of course
the<00:05:10.600> special<00:05:11.050> thing<00:05:11.260> about<00:05:11.530> the<00:05:12.100> combination

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:12.640 
the special thing about the combination

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.300 
the special thing about the combination
of<00:05:12.700> this<00:05:12.910> and<00:05:13.210> the<00:05:13.750> amp<00:05:13.870> is<00:05:14.050> there<00:05:14.260> kind<00:05:15.190> of

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
of this and the amp is there kind of

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.010 
of this and the amp is there kind of
matching<00:05:15.760> as<00:05:16.240> is<00:05:16.450> my<00:05:16.630> lead<00:05:17.790> but<00:05:18.790> it<00:05:19.690> sounds

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
matching as is my lead but it sounds

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:39.670 
matching as is my lead but it sounds
great
