now taking its turn now as you can see
it<00:04:49.090> is<00:04:49.240> chosen<00:04:49.570> to<00:04:49.630> come<00:04:49.780> down<00:04:49.930> here<00:04:50.020> and<00:04:50.139> take

the board

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.070 
the board
thus<00:04:53.770> this<00:04:54.340> time<00:04:54.580> I'll<00:04:54.790> get<00:04:54.940> less<00:04:55.120> gold<00:04:55.419> now<00:04:56.050> I

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
thus this time I'll get less gold now I

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.450 
thus this time I'll get less gold now I
can<00:04:56.320> keep<00:04:56.470> playing<00:04:56.650> it<00:04:56.889> since<00:04:57.040> you<00:04:57.100> have<00:04:57.160> four

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
can keep playing it since you have four

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.640 
can keep playing it since you have four
halflings<00:04:57.910> left<00:04:58.210> and<00:04:58.540> I<00:04:58.870> can<00:04:59.020> keep<00:04:59.169> duking<00:04:59.620> it

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
halflings left and I can keep duking it

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.230 
halflings left and I can keep duking it
out<00:04:59.770> and<00:04:59.919> taking<00:05:00.160> over<00:05:00.340> more<00:05:00.520> land<00:05:00.790> but

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
out and taking over more land but

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.159 
out and taking over more land but
eventually<00:05:01.540> you're<00:05:01.810> going<00:05:01.900> to<00:05:01.960> spread

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
eventually you're going to spread

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:03.450 
eventually you're going to spread
yourself<00:05:02.260> too<00:05:02.530> thin<00:05:02.650> and<00:05:02.979> you're<00:05:03.100> going<00:05:03.280> to<00:05:03.340> be

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
yourself too thin and you're going to be

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.920 
yourself too thin and you're going to be
out<00:05:03.580> of<00:05:03.610> Units<00:05:04.060> to<00:05:04.150> replace<00:05:04.450> because<00:05:04.630> you<00:05:04.720> have

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
out of Units to replace because you have

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.510 
out of Units to replace because you have
to<00:05:05.110> leave<00:05:05.290> a<00:05:05.320> unit<00:05:05.710> on<00:05:05.800> the<00:05:05.919> land<00:05:06.130> if<00:05:06.280> you<00:05:06.310> want

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
to leave a unit on the land if you want

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.159 
to leave a unit on the land if you want
to<00:05:06.580> keep<00:05:06.729> it<00:05:06.880> and<00:05:07.030> get<00:05:07.090> points<00:05:07.330> for<00:05:07.660> it<00:05:07.780> you

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
to keep it and get points for it you

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:10.710 
to keep it and get points for it you
can't<00:05:08.410> completely<00:05:08.740> leave<00:05:08.979> it<00:05:09.100> unoccupied<00:05:09.720> so

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
can't completely leave it unoccupied so

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.270 
can't completely leave it unoccupied so
eventually<00:05:11.200> when<00:05:11.650> you<00:05:11.740> run<00:05:11.889> out<00:05:11.919> of<00:05:12.100> players

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
eventually when you run out of players

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.670 
eventually when you run out of players
you<00:05:12.850> do<00:05:13.000> what<00:05:13.180> they<00:05:13.930> call<00:05:14.110> putting<00:05:14.410> your<00:05:14.560> race

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
you do what they call putting your race

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.920 
you do what they call putting your race
into<00:05:14.979> decline<00:05:15.430> I<00:05:15.820> click<00:05:16.240> down<00:05:16.360> here<00:05:16.600> the<00:05:16.810> word

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
into decline I click down here the word

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.800 
into decline I click down here the word
decline<00:05:17.260> pops<00:05:17.530> up<00:05:17.710> I<00:05:17.860> hit<00:05:17.979> that<00:05:18.419> do<00:05:19.419> I<00:05:19.510> really

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
decline pops up I hit that do I really

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.779 
decline pops up I hit that do I really
want<00:05:19.960> to<00:05:20.050> enter<00:05:20.320> my<00:05:20.350> race<00:05:20.590> into<00:05:20.800> decline<00:05:21.130> yes

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:21.789 
want to enter my race into decline yes

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:23.730 
want to enter my race into decline yes
and<00:05:22.090> now<00:05:22.539> basically<00:05:22.780> I<00:05:23.020> can't<00:05:23.260> play<00:05:23.470> as<00:05:23.620> them

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
and now basically I can't play as them

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
round 2 now and in round 2 the computer

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.650 
round 2 now and in round 2 the computer
will<00:05:35.830> take<00:05:35.979> its<00:05:36.160> turn<00:05:36.400> and<00:05:36.580> probably<00:05:37.360> wipe<00:05:37.510> me

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 
will take its turn and probably wipe me

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.180

it the iOS version of small world

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:22.490 
it the iOS version of small world
now<00:06:18.960> the<00:06:19.380> pros<00:06:19.650> and<00:06:19.860> cons<00:06:19.919> as<00:06:20.820> far<00:06:21.030> as<00:06:21.120> cons<00:06:21.500> we

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:22.500 
now the pros and cons as far as cons we

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.050 
now the pros and cons as far as cons we
left<00:06:22.680> the<00:06:22.770> sound<00:06:22.979> up<00:06:23.160> for<00:06:23.310> our<00:06:23.400> videoing<00:06:23.820> sake

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 
left the sound up for our videoing sake

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.570 
left the sound up for our videoing sake
but<00:06:24.479> the<00:06:25.020> music<00:06:25.320> is<00:06:25.410> a<00:06:25.440> slightly<00:06:25.830> annoying<00:06:26.220> and

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 
but the music is a slightly annoying and

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.340 
but the music is a slightly annoying and
you'll<00:06:27.090> probably<00:06:27.300> want<00:06:27.600> to<00:06:27.660> turn<00:06:27.810> it<00:06:27.930> down<00:06:27.990> or

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:28.350 
you'll probably want to turn it down or

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.700 
you'll probably want to turn it down or
possibly<00:06:28.919> often<00:06:29.310> the<00:06:29.400> options<00:06:30.440> secondly<00:06:31.440> it's

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:31.710 
possibly often the options secondly it's

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.920 
possibly often the options secondly it's
only<00:06:31.889> two-player<00:06:32.520> whereas<00:06:33.270> the<00:06:33.419> Borg<00:06:33.660> angle

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:33.930 
only two-player whereas the Borg angle

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:35.900 
only two-player whereas the Borg angle
is<00:06:34.020> anywhere<00:06:34.199> from<00:06:34.260> 2<00:06:34.560> to<00:06:34.590> 5<00:06:34.919> players<00:06:35.310> and<00:06:35.550> the

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:35.910 
is anywhere from 2 to 5 players and the

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:37.939 
is anywhere from 2 to 5 players and the
board<00:06:36.120> actually<00:06:36.449> scales<00:06:36.870> to<00:06:37.590> the<00:06:37.620> number<00:06:37.860> of

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:37.949 
board actually scales to the number of

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:39.050 
board actually scales to the number of
players<00:06:38.130> you<00:06:38.310> have<00:06:38.340> so<00:06:38.699> if<00:06:38.760> you<00:06:38.820> have<00:06:38.880> more

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.060 
players you have so if you have more

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.000 
players you have so if you have more
players<00:06:39.360> there's<00:06:39.870> more<00:06:40.080> land<00:06:40.320> a<00:06:40.530> larger<00:06:40.830> map

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.010 
players there's more land a larger map

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:42.529 
players there's more land a larger map
to<00:06:41.190> conquer<00:06:41.580> and<00:06:41.849> that's<00:06:42.000> kind<00:06:42.210> of<00:06:42.270> a<00:06:42.360> cool

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:42.539 
to conquer and that's kind of a cool

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:45.020 
to conquer and that's kind of a cool
thing<00:06:42.570> I<00:06:43.080> do<00:06:43.889> like<00:06:44.280> the<00:06:44.400> fact<00:06:44.520> that<00:06:44.789> it<00:06:44.910> does

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:45.030 
thing I do like the fact that it does

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:46.730 
thing I do like the fact that it does
not<00:06:45.150> pass<00:06:45.419> and<00:06:45.690> play<00:06:45.780> you<00:06:46.050> can<00:06:46.169> do<00:06:46.229> two<00:06:46.440> players

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:46.740 
not pass and play you can do two players

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.070 
not pass and play you can do two players
there<00:06:47.400> around<00:06:47.699> the<00:06:47.940> iPad<00:06:48.419> you<00:06:48.630> don't<00:06:48.810> have<00:06:48.960> to
