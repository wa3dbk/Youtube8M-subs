00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.720
 snoopy that we have called his pib for the 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.700
 apolo 13 I do not know if they remember or 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.550
 they know the history of apollo 13 that was 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:16.580
 the third mission that should go to the moon 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:19.520
 and a problem then is that in an oxygen 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:23.340
 the module where there was oxygen has been 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:27.090
 spoiled and they have not been able to go 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:31.099
 mine but they have had to return and for that 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:34.890
 have had to use the clock to 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:38.460
 correct the trajectory of the ship 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.770
 space to return healthy breasts and 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.700
 saved 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:47.129
 It's a pretty pretty and clear story 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.140
 Well I do not know if there have been but the 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.350
 people who worked for the nasa that 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.780
 be people whatever companies that 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.050
 they decided 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:00.269
 he got on board as they have called him 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.120
 It was good service 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:05.549
 that they had done it for the nasa 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.189
 they received an end if a pair of silvers 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.950
 nubia by design and that's why we've done 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.140
 this clock that is black the white that 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.210
 the hawthorn to be normal are black with 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.280
 white sheets we have made the opposite 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.470
 in this one is not a month but totally 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.070
 white with the nobel 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:27.869
 small lupi in the county that comes out very 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:30.590
 well a ceramic bezel also what 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.590
 we have put 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.710
 It is bright in this model 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.440
 and he is also the first one to come out 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.140
 pretty video pretty good as I've 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.680
 said is a limited edition to 1970 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.480
 pieces that is the year 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:51.700
 it is the anniversary of Apollo 13 but also 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:55.110
 the swing awards that has received omega 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.110
 in 1970 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:07.020
 It carries a special bracelet tissue 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:10.470
 side of the silver has the representation 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.580
 from the sky of the clear night sky 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.799
 is blue blue or black that is is 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:21.540
 glazed is said in Spanish badly in 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:24.390
 amulet enameled so they are 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:30.680
 covers that have to go to the oven 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:35.640
 to be enameled in 1970 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:38.730
 and then the cool thing is that each fund is 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:44.760
 different because in the end they put 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:46.440
 some pages of gravel silver and not 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.170
 plates 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:53.640
 pouler gold powder silver powder 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.640
 that remain as stars
