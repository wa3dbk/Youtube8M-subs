00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.870 
post that later okay so what I'm going
to<00:02:57.600> do<00:02:57.690> is<00:02:57.780> show<00:02:57.959> you<00:02:58.019> on<00:02:58.260> my<00:02:58.410> arm<00:02:58.650> so<00:02:58.980> here<00:02:59.850> I

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
to do is show you on my arm so here I

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.390 
to do is show you on my arm so here I
have<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.150> arm<00:03:00.299> here<00:03:00.690> and<00:03:00.900> this<00:03:01.890> is<00:03:02.040> obviously

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
have the arm here and this is obviously

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.860 
have the arm here and this is obviously
too<00:03:02.640> dark<00:03:02.850> of<00:03:02.970> a<00:03:03.030> color<00:03:03.060> for<00:03:03.540> me<00:03:03.630> because<00:03:03.810> I

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
too dark of a color for me because I

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.720 
too dark of a color for me because I
order<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.230> wrong<00:03:04.380> color<00:03:04.709> because<00:03:05.400> normally<00:03:05.700> I

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
order the wrong color because normally I

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.190 
order the wrong color because normally I
do<00:03:05.819> spray<00:03:06.030> tanning<00:03:06.360> and<00:03:06.660> I'm<00:03:06.720> usually<00:03:06.870> came

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
do spray tanning and I'm usually came

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.780 
do spray tanning and I'm usually came
back<00:03:07.380> to<00:03:07.530> this<00:03:07.620> color<00:03:07.860> but<00:03:08.099> I'm<00:03:08.220> pasty<00:03:08.610> right

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
back to this color but I'm pasty right

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.069 
back to this color but I'm pasty right
now<00:03:08.940> so<00:03:09.810> this<00:03:10.049> is<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.680> coverage<00:03:12.079> hopefully

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
now so this is the coverage hopefully

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.530 
now so this is the coverage hopefully
the<00:03:13.200> light<00:03:13.380> is<00:03:13.530> picking<00:03:13.950> up<00:03:14.130> on<00:03:14.340> it<00:03:14.579> it<00:03:15.000> covers

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
the light is picking up on it it covers

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.840 
the light is picking up on it it covers
really<00:03:16.019> well<00:03:16.200> for<00:03:16.769> me<00:03:16.950> personally<00:03:17.250> I<00:03:17.489> feel

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
really well for me personally I feel

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.180 
really well for me personally I feel
like<00:03:17.910> it<00:03:18.239> actually<00:03:18.750> compares<00:03:19.320> very<00:03:19.410> much<00:03:20.010> to

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
like it actually compares very much to

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.920 
like it actually compares very much to
the<00:03:20.280> dr<00:03:20.549> one<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.940> drone<00:03:21.239> covers<00:03:21.540> well<00:03:21.690> the

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
the dr one the drone covers well the

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.560 
the dr one the drone covers well the
sephora<00:03:22.350> one<00:03:22.560> does<00:03:22.739> as<00:03:22.980> well<00:03:23.310> and<00:03:23.609> I<00:03:24.269> feel<00:03:24.540> like

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
sephora one does as well and I feel like

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.080 
sephora one does as well and I feel like
the<00:03:25.140> coverage<00:03:25.530> it<00:03:25.680> stays<00:03:25.890> on<00:03:26.130> really<00:03:26.160> well<00:03:26.700> and

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
the coverage it stays on really well and

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.970 
the coverage it stays on really well and
if<00:03:27.239> you<00:03:27.359> can<00:03:27.540> see<00:03:27.720> on<00:03:27.810> my<00:03:27.930> arm<00:03:28.140> like<00:03:28.410> it<00:03:28.620> stays

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
if you can see on my arm like it stays

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.430 
if you can see on my arm like it stays
on<00:03:29.010> there<00:03:29.459> look<00:03:29.670> I'm<00:03:29.850> moving<00:03:30.600> it<00:03:30.780> I'm<00:03:30.959> budging

on there look I'm moving it I'm budging
it<00:03:31.560> it<00:03:31.709> doesn't<00:03:32.010> move<00:03:32.160> at<00:03:32.370> all<00:03:32.519> it<00:03:32.850> didn't<00:03:33.660> when

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
it it doesn't move at all it didn't when

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.660

I<00:03:33.810> wore<00:03:34.079> it<00:03:34.200> it<00:03:34.350> didn't<00:03:34.650> feel<00:03:34.769> cakey<00:03:35.070> it<00:03:35.519> was

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
I wore it it didn't feel cakey it was

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.059 
I wore it it didn't feel cakey it was
very<00:03:35.850> lightweight<00:03:36.209> it<00:03:36.870> still<00:03:37.620> had<00:03:37.739> enough

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
pigmentation to where I felt like it was

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:41.360 
pigmentation to where I felt like it was
actually<00:03:40.380> covering<00:03:40.680> some<00:03:40.890> of<00:03:40.980> my<00:03:41.100> you<00:03:41.340> know

to start using the aerosol foundations a

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:51.860 
to start using the aerosol foundations a
little<00:03:50.819> bit<00:03:50.970> more<00:03:51.209> because<00:03:51.420> it's<00:03:51.569> just<00:03:51.720> so

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
little bit more because it's just so

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.539 
little bit more because it's just so
quick<00:03:52.079> and<00:03:52.290> easy<00:03:52.560> but<00:03:52.920> I<00:03:52.950> just<00:03:53.160> want<00:03:53.370> to<00:03:53.430> spend

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
sixteen dollars in the Dior one and so

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.530 
sixteen dollars in the Dior one and so
the<00:03:55.680> price<00:03:55.889> of<00:03:56.100> this<00:03:56.280> I<00:03:56.489> mean<00:03:56.639> 26<00:03:57.090> dollars<00:03:57.269> even

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
the price of this I mean 26 dollars even

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.479 
the price of this I mean 26 dollars even
if<00:03:57.660> it<00:03:57.810> lasts<00:03:58.019> a<00:03:58.170> month<00:03:58.380> I<00:03:58.650> think<00:03:58.980> I'm<00:03:59.190> kind<00:03:59.400> of

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
if it lasts a month I think I'm kind of

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.699 
if it lasts a month I think I'm kind of
okay<00:03:59.760> with<00:03:59.940> that<00:04:00.120> and<00:04:00.590> because<00:04:01.590> I<00:04:01.620> think

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
okay with that and because I think

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.559 
okay with that and because I think
that's<00:04:02.010> a<00:04:02.130> fair<00:04:02.310> price<00:04:02.519> for<00:04:02.730> what<00:04:02.910> it<00:04:03.000> is<00:04:03.030> so<00:04:03.540> I

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
that's a fair price for what it is so I

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.539 
that's a fair price for what it is so I
give<00:04:04.079> it<00:04:04.109> a<00:04:04.260> two<00:04:04.470> thumbs<00:04:04.680> up<00:04:04.950> if<00:04:05.130> I<00:04:05.220> had<00:04:05.430> to

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
give it a two thumbs up if I had to

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.819 
give it a two thumbs up if I had to
compare<00:04:05.670> the<00:04:06.060> high-end<00:04:06.480> one<00:04:06.690> versus<00:04:07.290> the<00:04:07.560> you

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
compare the high-end one versus the you

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:10.009 
compare the high-end one versus the you
know<00:04:07.920> the<00:04:08.130> budget<00:04:08.549> brand<00:04:08.760> I<00:04:09.030> definitely<00:04:09.870> say

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
know the budget brand I definitely say

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.559 
know the budget brand I definitely say
this<00:04:10.170> is<00:04:10.380> still<00:04:10.620> this<00:04:11.340> is<00:04:11.459> a<00:04:11.489> winner<00:04:11.730> I<00:04:12.000> mean<00:04:12.540> I

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
this is still this is a winner I mean I

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.930 
this is still this is a winner I mean I
know<00:04:12.720> it's<00:04:12.989> not<00:04:13.139> like<00:04:13.440> drugstore<00:04:13.980> price<00:04:14.700> range

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
know it's not like drugstore price range

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.189 
know it's not like drugstore price range
you<00:04:15.060> know<00:04:15.180> it's<00:04:15.269> not<00:04:15.329> like<00:04:15.389> twelve<00:04:15.720> dollars<00:04:16.049> or

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 
you know it's not like twelve dollars or

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:17.689 
you know it's not like twelve dollars or
less<00:04:16.229> is<00:04:16.470> still<00:04:16.650> twenty<00:04:16.919> six<00:04:17.130> dollars<00:04:17.310> so<00:04:17.639> it

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699 
less is still twenty six dollars so it

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:18.890 
less is still twenty six dollars so it
still<00:04:17.910> is<00:04:17.940> going<00:04:18.120> to<00:04:18.269> cost<00:04:18.479> you<00:04:18.600> a<00:04:18.630> little<00:04:18.810> bit

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
still is going to cost you a little bit

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:19.629 
still is going to cost you a little bit
of<00:04:18.989> money

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
of money

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.099 
of money
but<00:04:19.819> for<00:04:20.030> what<00:04:20.180> you<00:04:20.269> get<00:04:20.449> I<00:04:20.479> think<00:04:20.659> this<00:04:20.959> is

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
but for what you get I think this is

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.170 
but for what you get I think this is
definitely<00:04:21.289> worth<00:04:21.709> it<00:04:22.189> I'm<00:04:22.249> compared<00:04:22.999> to<00:04:23.090> the

Sephora has it in five colors that's the

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:28.570 
Sephora has it in five colors that's the
only<00:04:27.530> bad<00:04:27.710> thing<00:04:27.740> there<00:04:28.039> aren't<00:04:28.279> a<00:04:28.340> ton<00:04:28.370> of

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
only bad thing there aren't a ton of

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.010 
only bad thing there aren't a ton of
colors<00:04:28.849> so<00:04:29.029> it's<00:04:29.270> going<00:04:29.360> to<00:04:29.419> be<00:04:29.569> kind<00:04:29.779> of<00:04:29.810> hard

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
colors so it's going to be kind of hard

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.779 
colors so it's going to be kind of hard
to<00:04:30.139> color<00:04:30.379> match<00:04:30.620> but<00:04:30.949> if<00:04:31.039> you<00:04:31.129> just<00:04:31.310> do<00:04:31.520> a

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:31.789 
to color match but if you just do a

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:33.969 
to color match but if you just do a
light<00:04:32.689> mist<00:04:32.960> like<00:04:33.169> I<00:04:33.229> said<00:04:33.499> put<00:04:33.650> your<00:04:33.800> hair<00:04:33.949> up

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:33.979 
light mist like I said put your hair up

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:36.459 
light mist like I said put your hair up

00:04:36.459 --> 00:04:36.469 
in a towel mist it very lightly because

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:38.679 
in a towel mist it very lightly because
it's<00:04:36.800> going<00:04:36.889> to<00:04:36.949> give<00:04:37.189> you<00:04:37.340> a<00:04:37.370> very<00:04:37.699> smooth

finish<00:04:38.719> but<00:04:39.319> it's<00:04:39.439> not<00:04:39.590> going<00:04:39.770> to<00:04:39.830> be<00:04:39.919> heavy

00:04:40.149 --> 00:04:40.159 
finish but it's not going to be heavy

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:42.070 
finish but it's not going to be heavy
you<00:04:40.400> won't<00:04:40.580> have<00:04:40.729> to<00:04:40.879> worry<00:04:41.090> about<00:04:41.210> harsh

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.050 
you won't have to worry about harsh
lines<00:04:42.439> because<00:04:42.830> it's<00:04:42.979> such<00:04:43.189> a<00:04:43.219> fine<00:04:43.580> mist<00:04:43.849> it's

00:04:48.459 --> 00:04:48.469 
the color matching shouldn't be

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:50.320 
the color matching shouldn't be
extremely<00:04:49.129> hard<00:04:49.430> but<00:04:49.699> again<00:04:49.969> just<00:04:50.180> five
