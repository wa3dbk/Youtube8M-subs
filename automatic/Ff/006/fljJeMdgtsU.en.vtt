the new choice is pretty limited because

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.600 
the new choice is pretty limited because
only<00:06:21.930> the<00:06:22.140> canvas<00:06:22.470> night<00:06:22.680> supports<00:06:23.190> dual<00:06:23.340> SIM

so<00:06:31.830> my<00:06:31.980> conclusion<00:06:32.220> if<00:06:32.820> you<00:06:33.120> can<00:06:33.240> afford<00:06:33.330> to<00:06:33.630> go

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:33.750 
so my conclusion if you can afford to go

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.350 
so my conclusion if you can afford to go

can the canvas nigh

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:40.230 
can the canvas nigh
is<00:06:37.480> not<00:06:37.720> about<00:06:37.930> by<00:06:38.200> either<00:06:38.610> but<00:06:39.610> that's<00:06:39.940> just

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 
is not about by either but that's just

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.630 
is not about by either but that's just

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:42.640 
me what do you guys think do you think

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.700 
me what do you guys think do you think
I'm<00:06:42.970> right<00:06:43.240> and<00:06:43.420> choosing<00:06:43.810> the<00:06:43.900> ile<00:06:44.080> ife<00:06:44.200> 7

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:44.710 
I'm right and choosing the ile ife 7

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.530 
I'm right and choosing the ile ife 7
over<00:06:44.890> the<00:06:44.920> canvas<00:06:45.160> tonight<00:06:45.490> or<00:06:45.910> do<00:06:46.240> you<00:06:46.330> think

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:46.540 
over the canvas tonight or do you think

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.230 
over the canvas tonight or do you think
the<00:06:46.630> canvas<00:06:46.930> 9<00:06:47.110> is<00:06:47.320> the<00:06:47.470> relative<00:06:47.830> ICEA

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 
the canvas 9 is the relative ICEA

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.130 
the canvas 9 is the relative ICEA

limiting your thoughts in the comments
below<00:06:50.170> so<00:06:50.650> I<00:06:51.010> guess<00:06:51.160> that<00:06:51.340> pretty<00:06:51.550> much<00:06:51.760> wraps

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:52.030
