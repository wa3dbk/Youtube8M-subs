00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.270 

so<00:00:11.580> we're<00:00:11.760> gonna<00:00:11.850> paper<00:00:12.180> punch<00:00:12.740> all<00:00:13.740> of<00:00:14.040> these

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
so we're gonna paper punch all of these

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.990 
so we're gonna paper punch all of these
so<00:00:15.180> I<00:00:15.480> find<00:00:15.780> it<00:00:15.930> easiest<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.770> just<00:00:17.630> gauge<00:00:18.630> it

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
so I find it easiest to just gauge it

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.800 
so I find it easiest to just gauge it
and<00:00:24.650> just<00:00:25.650> eat<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.190> between<00:00:26.640> this<00:00:27.060> edge<00:00:27.360> and

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
and just eat it between this edge and

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.439 
and just eat it between this edge and
this<00:00:28.140> edge<00:00:28.440> you<00:00:28.830> just<00:00:29.460> kind<00:00:29.850> of<00:00:29.910> try<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.090> get<00:00:30.300> in

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
this edge you just kind of try to get in

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.950 
this edge you just kind of try to get in
the<00:00:30.600> middle<00:00:32.300> just<00:00:33.300> like<00:00:33.540> that

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
the middle just like that

00:00:33.960 --> 00:01:01.770 
the middle just like that
it<00:00:34.379> doesn't<00:00:34.680> have<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.890> be<00:00:35.010> perfect

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.140 

okay<00:01:02.780> so<00:01:03.410> now<00:01:03.649> that<00:01:04.009> we<00:01:04.220> have<00:01:04.250> all<00:01:04.549> of<00:01:04.699> pages

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
okay so now that we have all of pages

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.030 
okay so now that we have all of pages

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
we're going to set this aside we're

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.990 
we're going to set this aside we're
gonna<00:01:07.159> work<00:01:07.400> on<00:01:07.640> our<00:01:07.909> straws<00:01:09.250> okay<00:01:10.250> that

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
gonna work on our straws okay that

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.800 
gonna work on our straws okay that
that's<00:01:11.659> these<00:01:12.259> and<00:01:12.890> we're<00:01:13.670> going<00:01:14.119> to<00:01:14.390> slice

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
that's these and we're going to slice

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.590 
that's these and we're going to slice
them<00:01:15.259> so<00:01:16.100> this<00:01:16.670> is<00:01:16.880> the<00:01:17.060> part<00:01:17.299> you've<00:01:17.420> got<00:01:17.450> to

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
them so this is the part you've got to

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:25.149 
them so this is the part you've got to
be<00:01:17.780> really<00:01:18.259> really<00:01:18.530> careful<00:01:18.799> okay<00:01:23.409> so<00:01:24.409> I<00:01:24.619> just

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
be really really careful okay so I just

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.180 
be really really careful okay so I just
used<00:01:25.399> one<00:01:25.610> of<00:01:25.640> these<00:01:25.909> you<00:01:26.299> can<00:01:26.450> use<00:01:26.750> an<00:01:27.190> exacto

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
used one of these you can use an exacto

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.419 
used one of these you can use an exacto
knife<00:01:28.520> or<00:01:28.990> any<00:01:29.990> kind<00:01:30.319> of<00:01:30.440> knife<00:01:30.619> that<00:01:31.130> you<00:01:31.220> have

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:31.429 
knife or any kind of knife that you have

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:34.809 
knife or any kind of knife that you have
and<00:01:31.700> with<00:01:32.690> these<00:01:32.869> straws<00:01:33.259> it's<00:01:33.619> a<00:01:34.069> little<00:01:34.670> bit

00:01:34.809 --> 00:01:34.819 
and with these straws it's a little bit

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:36.760 
and with these straws it's a little bit
easier<00:01:35.119> because<00:01:35.300> there<00:01:35.659> is<00:01:35.899> a<00:01:35.929> line<00:01:36.409> that<00:01:36.710> goes

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
easier because there is a line that goes

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.309 
easier because there is a line that goes
across<00:01:37.250> here<00:01:37.610> so<00:01:38.509> if<00:01:38.630> you<00:01:38.720> just<00:01:38.869> follow<00:01:39.140> the

00:01:39.309 --> 00:01:39.319 
across here so if you just follow the

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:42.040 
across here so if you just follow the
lines<00:01:39.649> you<00:01:39.920> should<00:01:40.130> be<00:01:40.280> fine<00:01:40.630> okay<00:01:41.630> so<00:01:41.690> what

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
lines you should be fine okay so what

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.059 
lines you should be fine okay so what
you're<00:01:42.200> going<00:01:42.319> to<00:01:42.380> want<00:01:42.530> to<00:01:42.619> do<00:01:42.800> is<00:01:42.920> you're

00:01:43.059 --> 00:01:43.069 
you're going to want to do is you're

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:46.149 
you're going to want to do is you're
going<00:01:43.190> to<00:01:43.250> eyeball<00:01:43.909> it<00:01:44.319> basically<00:01:45.319> because<00:01:46.009> we

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
going to eyeball it basically because we

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.210 
going to eyeball it basically because we
can<00:01:46.340> adjust<00:01:46.460> it<00:01:46.940> to<00:01:47.210> make<00:01:47.360> it<00:01:47.509> fit<00:01:47.810> on<00:01:48.220> your

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
can adjust it to make it fit on your

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.240 
can adjust it to make it fit on your
papers<00:01:49.729> so<00:01:50.479> what<00:01:50.690> we're<00:01:50.869> going<00:01:51.110> to<00:01:51.259> do<00:01:51.590> is<00:01:51.890> we

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
papers so what we're going to do is we

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.899 
papers so what we're going to do is we
are<00:01:52.490> going<00:01:52.880> to<00:01:54.039> basically<00:01:55.039> cut<00:01:55.490> into<00:01:55.819> the

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
pages into the straw and this is where I

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.360 
pages into the straw and this is where I
said<00:03:24.670> if<00:03:24.820> you<00:03:25.000> need<00:03:25.210> to<00:03:25.500> to<00:03:26.500> cut<00:03:26.770> a<00:03:26.800> little<00:03:27.190> bit

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
said if you need to to cut a little bit

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.740 
said if you need to to cut a little bit
longer<00:03:27.970> of<00:03:28.450> a<00:03:28.890> in<00:03:29.890> your<00:03:30.190> straw<00:03:30.460> this<00:03:31.210> is<00:03:31.390> where

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
longer of a in your straw this is where

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.900 
longer of a in your straw this is where
you<00:03:31.900> should<00:03:31.960> do<00:03:32.230> that<00:03:32.410> so<00:03:33.160> it<00:03:33.580> will<00:03:33.670> look<00:03:33.880> just

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
you should do that so it will look just

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.860 
you should do that so it will look just
like<00:03:34.270> that<00:03:34.600> and<00:03:35.310> because<00:03:36.310> this<00:03:37.270> is<00:03:37.330> three

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
like that and because this is three

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.020 
like that and because this is three
thicknesses<00:03:38.290> of<00:03:38.980> paper<00:03:39.310> that<00:03:39.550> we<00:03:39.700> glued

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
thicknesses of paper that we glued

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.880 
thicknesses of paper that we glued
together<00:03:40.890> okay<00:03:41.890> so<00:03:43.620> you're<00:03:44.620> just<00:03:44.740> gonna

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
together okay so you're just gonna

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.150 
together okay so you're just gonna
insert<00:03:45.190> it<00:03:45.580> and<00:03:46.330> it's<00:03:46.570> pretty<00:03:47.020> sturdy<00:03:47.350> so<00:03:47.710> if

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
insert it and it's pretty sturdy so if

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.340

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
straw turns independently with one

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.740 
straw turns independently with one
another<00:04:01.870> so<00:04:02.350> it<00:04:02.680> will<00:04:02.950> be<00:04:03.100> fine<00:04:03.390> so<00:04:04.390> we're
