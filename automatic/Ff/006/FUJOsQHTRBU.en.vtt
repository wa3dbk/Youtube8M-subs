the whole time yeah towards the end

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.300 
the whole time yeah towards the end
there<00:03:58.019> when<00:03:58.260> I<00:03:58.290> kind<00:03:58.799> of<00:03:58.890> started<00:03:59.040> slowing

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
there when I kind of started slowing

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.740 
there when I kind of started slowing
down<00:03:59.459> a<00:03:59.519> little<00:03:59.579> more<00:03:59.850> cuz<00:04:00.030> i<00:04:00.090> saw<00:04:00.239> the<00:04:00.299> gap<00:04:00.510> was

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
down a little more cuz i saw the gap was

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.420 
down a little more cuz i saw the gap was
getting<00:04:00.930> bigger<00:04:01.049> I<00:04:01.410> figured<00:04:02.070> I<00:04:02.130> was<00:04:02.280> probably

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
getting bigger I figured I was probably
