00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.420
 the battery smartphone is more mobile here 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.160
 companion 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.500
 With it you can take pictures videos 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.070
 of course they want to record that too 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.049
 to back up 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.210
 because how do you do that best on the 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.590
 computer and vice versa you want 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.119
 maybe like to take music or 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.520
 Photos you maybe only from the past 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.840
 have synonymous new videos so synonymous 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.010
 the files have to be somehow 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.260
 be replaced 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.529
 how does it work? 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.269
 the supplied usb data cable the 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.859
 data cable I have already now the 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.140
 smartphone plugged in I plug that 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.590
 Now here in my notebook 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.960
 at the side so now we look up 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.550
 our smartphone is currently here 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.570
 no window on my 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.129
 smartphone is up in the 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.590
 notification a usb symbol 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.910
 surfaced we look for there is 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.190
 load it 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.329
 that means I load my smartphone now 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.030
 already at the connection with the 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.840
 Computer on but I want to date 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.100
 change 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.789
 that's why I'll click on the 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.619
 Options like that and say the device should be 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:06.930
 Usb mass storage are in order 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:08.909
 that takes a second for me now 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.040
 means that my smartphone becomes too 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.750
 a normal external device like one 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.000
 hard disk a usb stick one 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.780
 memory card and I can on it 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.490
 access 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.900
 you can already see it here 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.400
 There are two windows directly to it 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.770
 come but we just let's see 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:28.140
 together we have the window what we are now 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:30.930
 just see is the window of a sd 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.790
 card , it understands all that 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.520
 you on the memory card of my device 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.310
 I 'll do that now and that 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.850
 the card is the representation of the card 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.180
 internal memory provides currently one 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.140
 small beautiful side by side 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.850
 I retake the view 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.170
 a little bit bigger 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.520
 medium in size and they look all over here 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.799
 different folders 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.360
 the great thing is on the left side now 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.880
 i have my computer and on the 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.670

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.200
 I look at my pictures after so 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.549
 There are now six pieces as 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.310

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.150
 on the right side and there we see 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.850
 The folders are also named here 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:20.600
 open music pictures super once 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.940
 and there I can say insert and 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.880

 of course with music then times now 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:40.640

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:43.250
 then copy a step back my 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.040

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.570

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.890
 Now let's go to the next 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.520
 videos because maybe I would like too 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:55.220

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.580

 you have such films in synonymous 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.860
 different formats maybe even 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.840
 in full hd then the computer offers more 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.670
 because it is a mobile device what he is 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.560
 has realized that to convert is too 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.340
 changing it is quite small 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.080
 adjust 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.520
 the battery smartphones are like that 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.290
 powerful that they have so many 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.120
 standards and support on solutions 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.400
 that they just do all things 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.530
 just copy and you'll be surprised 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.920

 just make the folders here 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.670
 I have to go to my smartphone now 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.190
 just pull out the cable 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.050
 I was up here the other day 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.220
 then the connection is interrupted 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.739
 whole is now updated again 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.540
 internally but the great thing is in the moment 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.360
 where i use the smartphone with the computer 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.370
