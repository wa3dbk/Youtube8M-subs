 bye bye today i wanted to make you some of her 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.440
 comfortable with lipsticks 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:18.020
 obviously not of all the many 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.240
 lately but i wanted to do you some 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.609
 swatch of quero sites that I have from more 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.830
 time and what I use the most 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:27.590
 even those I like to stand erect 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:30.560
 more and therefore are a bit divided let's say 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:34.399
 between that 7 news those of the day and 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.890
 then a little bit stronger then the 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:41.300
 end of the video you will see which one is mine 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.739
 absolute favorite lipstick in 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.680
 this I'm wearing 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:50.239
 on this is the lipstick for which I 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:53.660
 I go crazy and you will see as lipstick 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:56.300
 at the end of the video making 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.800
 Also these swatch say we rosetti 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.829
 directly on the lips 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:04.690
 you can also see that a trick like 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:07.930
 this is very neutral let's say 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.910
 simple smokey with a bit of dark blue 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.970
 a little black 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:15.430
 you can see how many red cards 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.760
 colors you can wear with one 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:21.280
 same trick so many times just change 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.780
 rose color and the whole look 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.470
 change 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:32.470
 I leave you to the video we leave immediately with 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:36.190
 a beautiful we say pink arancino news 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:38.710
 of the bean and this lipstick that you 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.870
 really like the 208 just for 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.470
 the fact that it doesn't make my teeth look like it 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:47.890
 within put them like other news 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.830
 then he always has who with the 399 beautiful 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.080
 this too obviously these are 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:56.170
 rosseti that I consider news because 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:02:00.600
 they are however very very natural and 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.600
 creamy, obviously very moisturizing 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.439
 now let's move on to the lipsticks that are more 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:09.170
 what rosettes I consider them almost gods 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:11.569
 colored balms conditioners room because 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:15.860
 they have a very high opacity 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:20.620
 exit the coco shine 46 for chanel themes 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:24.440
 and an absolutely lipstick of the day 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.870
 the same also the rouge allure 17 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.410

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.180
 very gir 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.400
 great for all the ladies I would say maybe 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.930
 a color a bit too ladyish though 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.930
 very very nice 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.990
 a lipstick that I like a lot from 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:51.390
 day that has one 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:54.280
 a shade we say almost orange 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.120
 mechanical orange and this is your make up 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.630
 for ever 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.020
 the rouge art is natural 39 absolutely 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.020
 beautiful 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:07.420

 time then we move on to more lipsticks 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.830
 evening most of the afternoon also because 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:36.750
 they are much more opaque this time 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:40.300
 this lancom ace their bus 330 e 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:44.800

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:47.890
 mauve mila is another one of kiko than me 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:51.040
 I immediately adore 517 and this is a 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.690
 crazy lipstick let's say one of those 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.770
 rosettes that I absolutely love 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.780
 wear when I go to the disco 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:01.870
 too much veil maybe it will seem a bit too 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:06.040
 too many tacky but I really like it 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:09.400

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:32.020
 less than the Arctic 517 are a lot 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:34.570
