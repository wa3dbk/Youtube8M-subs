00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:16.570
 all people 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.220
 the topic is today 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.109
 Picture AP I want to bring new quick launch bar 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:22.339
 more 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:25.599
 Under Windows servers you can still actually pop them 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:27.169
 Bar approx 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:29.339
 the many people percent 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:33.589
 Do not offer what they want and they should just do the old lifepr 

00:00:33.589 --> 00:00:36.589
 is that and have us right w 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.150
 in addition to this 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.239
 TAS dpa 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.020
 on the highways 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.020
 Symbol could shine 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.940
 why should both have agreed before 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.170
 Percent male 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.420
 the quick launch bar 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.040
 Cars a similar official start in Compiègne itself just 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.460
 the eponymous one undermined that 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.050
 the program is running 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.050
 I can also do normal Küttel missed jobs 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.180
 the program was aimed 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.540
 it is on again 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.740
 climb fast 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.450
 if you use that as excessive it's so important that I used it earlier 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.920
 it is from the left edge of the screen to the right edge of the screen 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.920
 So I sat there had to have an extra line for it 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.020
 Want to have Bundesliga 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.670
 so if you look 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.590
 whether this possibility offered us as always a right click on the 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.729
 Plans place on the taskbar venue is in advance 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.039
 and none at all 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:43.500
 Stadler, he is there 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.650
 but have the possibility to create a new toolbar 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.720
 if we do that 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.720
 In March, we will ask you to set our position 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.320
 to show you should have 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.329
 just give up 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.170
 Spark was 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.120
 see running up 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.120
 User from the fire nude photos 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.299
 I hide 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:12.209
 Folders would be hidden 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.619
 Hunter 3 Tri top in the 

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:17.329
 it becomes an honest one 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:20.329
 the harmony rek / afp 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.799
 arriving later 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:27.799
 Finally, after all, now flew him 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.069
 Internet experts Microsoft 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.959
 and then 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.150
 believe in the internet and there is no decent sound 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.259
 this is the folder adultery 

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:42.259
 choose the machine because of their brisk and behold 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.399
 and sometimes you click 

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:49.399
 now sort the whole thing a bit 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.209
 Team the new cover 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:57.759
 bad 

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:58.919
 until the day before 

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:01.919
 and now 

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:06.749
 May on the square Sparta too 

00:03:06.749 --> 00:03:09.749
 not only that in or above 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:14.359
 and so 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:16.629
 until 10 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:19.200
 next with the back and forth slide has been too 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.639
 works better 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:23.139
 okay that's plausible forums 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:25.559
 every now and then 

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:29.609
 but somewhat pale gruesome from the data Wattens risks 

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:34.129
 the retirees still settled and jammer text without end 

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:38.089
 the low pay and somewhere does not want to have at all 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.679
 On the same day everything was what she had ever been before 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:46.339
 easy 

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:49.339
 legally and then this program will come from an Israeli 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.379
 and way is that's ever right 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.220
 now he also has the text and region keeper the place is so 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.219
 not bad on a vacancy 

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:04.019
 Calculate title ads 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.159
 and 8 then 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:09.159
 Text display cover exactly that looks pretty good 

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:13.339
 I know that everyone seemed over 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.069
 then I have something very strong 

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:18.759
 beaten 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:20.609
 under Vista 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.069
 Fix Christoph 

00:04:23.069 --> 00:04:25.840
 under billing Zickler look up 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.840
 to 4 

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:33.069
 That's pretty good on the whole 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.440
 but now I have the first problem as soon as I start here 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:42.599
 turn up these stairs again club Erdinger year 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:47.479
 Many actually did not want to have it now when it was like before 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:48.059
 again 

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:51.240
 and always everything is not successful 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.290
 Just try to sit down and let it be clear then 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:58.529
 going 

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:01.439
 to let and run the programs 

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:03.050
 go to the 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.050
 Pasqua determines properties have opportunities 

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:09.999
 No here the possibility of grouping hide caption 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.439
 Let's hope so 

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:16.370
 Thomas Berger 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.680
 you do not know bad 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.289
 until the big one 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:22.650
 the hall 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.520
 Continued unfortunately 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.520
 this is also possible to use small icons here 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.620
 Well that already looks like half-timbered house 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.300
 that's all right 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.089
 very close 

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:39.240
 Manchester 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.240
 or not 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:44.580
 I hope you liked it 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:45.580
 Until next time
