00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:09.680
 academy finally comes from the 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:13.519
 Greek philosopher what is called platon 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:15.590
 and the pocket privilege that moment by 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.890
 platon was an approach from 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:19.869
 centers of interest 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.740
 the whole ritual spa project as 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:22.630
 other projects that are tanned 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.740
 that help me are very much associated with a 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.740
 perseverance question late 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.810
 the dream begins with a phase the phase 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:36.930
 and there we have seen by the success of this 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.430
 this first phase which let's say is 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.830
 quite unique in its meaning by the 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.810
 partnership that links around the 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.810
 end of the subsequent phases of course 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:52.210
 the primary purpose of sport study was that 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:56.140
 people can have a normal life 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:58.480
 with his friends with his family that they 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.250
 can enjoy all of this and be 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.620
 able to practice his sport at the level of 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.589
 they wanted hopes and those of their 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.780
 teens 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.460
 with sports studies it's really 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.920
 nice organization because if they 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.179
 had passed the gymnasts we would not 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.439
 not able to get to the level that 

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:15.149
 takes place because it takes too much 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.280
 of training hours that outside of 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:20.390
 school if that would be it really 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.490
 wait time level in the 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.500
 I play two hours for his mother 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.930
 does not reappear thanks to the program that out 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.830
 program very singles singles by 6 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:34.190
 so that's the double the program of 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.670
 music is the one with the best 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.710
 teams 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.440
 especially if you have plenty of time to 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.680
 every day two hours of music in 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.300
 more of the academy than the morning what 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.409
 makes that more compatible since there is 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.390
 is good 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.249
 motorcycle slipped fishing part of the house 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.630
 I was in Montreal for the 

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:54.030
 baseball because he had no 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.770
 structure city today my nerves 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.939
 without joy the baseball trains at one 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.039
 want to team trees in the middle 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.709
 powerful thank you but the players of our 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:03.600
 region or infrastructure we are from 

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:05.969
 more and more workouts that are 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:10.129
 your nostrils you national so that's 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.129
 striking of a nature retention 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:45.850
 I would say that the academy of booms 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:47.980
 if it is the accompaniment the test my 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.380
 teachers one thing that was there that's 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.210
 really support support to all 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.920
 days backs up like I said when we 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.080
 part in competition where they are there 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.060
 catch-up sessions and study period 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.060
 of individualized and then all alone 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.190
 85% say many other models 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.980
 the young people works there in well 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.849
 still 1 15% jungle it takes 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.000
 work differently 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:14.010
 then that's where we work 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.870
 starts the spar structure is sure to 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.849
 what they aim for academy I think 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.130
 that my motivation comes from everything except 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.390
 of the sports world of values 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.620
 instilled in the sport can be 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.250
 able to live daily 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.250
 this unexpected 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.610
 we can help you become 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.010
 good sized brothers face already clean 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:37.080
 and we had pulled out the cabin and the 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.080
 rampage according to mrs soumahoro 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.610
 and another achievement top a 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:47.150
 reaches the rate can reach its goal 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.650
 but his world with friends work cat 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.489
 then if you really want to take it 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.739
 but your statement 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:55.519
 if we turn the wine you show me 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.519
 your character 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:06.330
 the dream has come true is what we 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:09.000
 can remember from this adventure it's so 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.150
 we do not have rai said this lady 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.150
 years 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.120
 furze the project of the estaques years that 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.530
 it's become for me it's a trace 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.109
 important in the history of a 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.060
 community and that a great vision comes 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.740
 the usa 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.020
 and then they managed to multiply on 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.940
 stung 6 to do powerful leverage example 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.370
 to raise the same thing everywhere 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.590
 elsewhere but quebec on a day a 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.430
 some of the best places 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.430
 to help you 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.319
 succeed with our people who have been in 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:43.539
 able to offer them centers 

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:45.759
 interests the extent of their expectations to 

00:04:43.539 --> 00:04:47.860
 the extent of their patients have it either 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:51.270
 in the trees this is in space this 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.270
 either in the team can and not 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.360
 2 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.040
 and 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.240
 because success for me is 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:19.350
 simply to be happy in his wine 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:21.620
 in what we do in terms that 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.620
 have said
