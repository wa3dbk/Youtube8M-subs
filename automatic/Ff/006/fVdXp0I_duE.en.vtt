00:00:00.509 --> 00:00:04.889
 Pauli Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.429
 the agreement is like that often 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.429
 I have now bought a video Koppe 

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:14.999
 Percent the pollen logie went 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.749

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:20.749
 yes exactly Logi left 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:24.720
 meanwhile, USB Kruppa 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.939
 with audio 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.869
 and Pröll cloudy times show how that work 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.660
 if you can not ask anyone Walsh I have only one so far 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.820
 Video fits, he says Kirchner Puma thought make time synonymous 1 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.470
 then would have more namely on this Howlett video studio SW 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.180
 the 4d 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.390
 that's the software 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.890
 then lift film as assistant 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.610
 too thick against club and certificate on the body of the shoulder 8 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.850
 the Game Cube is turned on 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.210
 worn chestnut night 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.620
 yes move 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.250
 he is made into the usb interface Rheine made 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.000
 fit to wear healthy as profile 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
 then never recording 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.980
 Wodin 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.980
 suspend the changed 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.690
 what should this 8 now 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.690
 okay, here we see the picture 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.570
 from the GameCube Credit to or subordinate Legend or right ever 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:50.280
 after this 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.600
 Yes 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.210
 twitching 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.670
 so 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.110
 caught I've heard had some problems had to run again 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.440
 I've got googles 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.570
 and that had helped in the end too 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.689
 here under the options offers these different settings 

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:15.689
 what does video recording scepter mean and then steadily I knock on like that 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:16.869
 Tuono the St 

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:18.489
 Video no idea 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.949
 Fact you have to ask for the composites 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:23.949
 Of course often with the door 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:27.429
 hurried Fabisch is the rest wants 

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:29.139
 you leave 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:30.919
 he leaves you like that 

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:33.919
 say okay 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:40.649
 the files then that's just like that 

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:44.119
 now it comes interesting what happened to me today 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:47.359
 in fact 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:51.370
 had he tried I am now practiced leaflets of Zelda 

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:52.649
 Erwin Becker trend 

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:56.459
 Halftime tries to start the game just to make my little test match 

00:02:57.899 --> 00:03:00.649

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:02.589
 darß 

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:06.489
 Normally, effects come up year the question 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.510
 you can switch to 60 fixed or not 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:13.639
 I can not think about the question 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:15.369
 definitely 

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:19.339
 you can not change this to 60 hertz because the video card has 

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:21.069
 no picture 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.069
 Patrick Baum I do not know 

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:28.629
 Well, then the war from me again 

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:35.579

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.949
 Goose always crash lent I do not know why Puma Kucka 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:45.369
 otherwise you might get let's play loud from the GameCube or 

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:48.369
 from n64 or ab is where 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:52.989
