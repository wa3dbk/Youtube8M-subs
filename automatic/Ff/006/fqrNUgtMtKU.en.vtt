 associated only with the carriage of 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.380
 loads 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.330
 but thanks to genetic crosses are

 nobility of the renowned equine breeds 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:33.980
 mules and donkeys has attracted the attention of 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.980
 breeders and lovers of horse riding 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.129

 But today we got there. 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.030
 is to open up a very large leisure market 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.460
 and competition 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.670
 events add value to animals and 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.829
 happen at least once a month to 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.110

 robson modesto bet on this new 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.110
 Marketplace 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:05.189
 the paulistano left comfortable employment 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:07.049
 in a store to invest mules here 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.689
 on the modest family property in the 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:13.020

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.100
 for the competition 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.920
 This mule here, for example, is Mona Lisa 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.289
 one of the most recently awarded 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.990
 received a tender offer of 100 thousand 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:26.520
 real value considered normal in this 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.770
 Marketplace 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.340
 the proposal by Mona Lisa was rejected 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.170
 because it is the showcase of the sankara resort 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.130
 alone brought more than 30 awards to 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.479
