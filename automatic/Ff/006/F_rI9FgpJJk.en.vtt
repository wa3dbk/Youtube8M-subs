00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
your current human eye k rig so this is

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.010 
your current human eye k rig so this is
a<00:00:17.400> chameleon<00:00:17.730> character<00:00:18.300> part<00:00:18.600> of<00:00:18.660> our<00:00:18.750> video

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
ape character so we have a death cycle

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.910 
ape character so we have a death cycle
an<00:00:39.420> idle<00:00:39.690> cycle<00:00:40.170> are<00:00:41.180> jumping<00:00:42.180> cycle<00:00:42.920> running

and walking shooting the ape character
is<00:00:49.230> under<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.620> human<00:00:49.980> human<00:00:50.610> eye<00:00:50.700> k<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.410> we<00:00:52.410> open

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
is under a human human eye k and we open

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.319 
is under a human human eye k and we open
up<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:53.010> human<00:00:53.280> eye<00:00:53.370> cage<00:00:53.640> through<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.030> window

up a human eye cage through a window

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.229 
up a human eye cage through a window
editor<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:55.170> human<00:00:55.530> eye<00:00:55.620> k<00:00:58.910> so<00:00:59.910> we'll<00:01:00.059> remember

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
editor and human eye k so we'll remember

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.789 
editor and human eye k so we'll remember
the<00:01:00.480> character<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.260> eight<00:01:01.590> master<00:01:02.100> and

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
the character is eight master and

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:06.890 
the character is eight master and
sources<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.890> control<00:01:05.250> rig<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:06.479> we'll<00:01:06.600> go<00:01:06.689> back

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
sources the control rig so we'll go back

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:20.340 
sources the control rig so we'll go back
to<00:01:07.080> our<00:01:07.110> original<00:01:07.350> one<00:01:08.510> which<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.890> chameleon

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:33.570 

and<00:01:20.440> we'll<00:01:21.400> import<00:01:23.010> the<00:01:24.010> ape<00:01:24.430> cycles<00:01:32.580> so

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
and we'll import the ape cycles so

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.160 
and we'll import the ape cycles so
they're<00:01:33.790> different<00:01:33.940> sizes<00:01:34.180> but<00:01:34.720> the<00:01:34.990> cool

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
they're different sizes but the cool

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.570 
they're different sizes but the cool
thing<00:01:35.350> about<00:01:35.409> human<00:01:35.770> ika<00:01:36.070> is<00:01:36.220> it<00:01:36.340> doesn't

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
thing about human ika is it doesn't

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.170 
thing about human ika is it doesn't
really<00:01:36.700> care<00:01:37.290> in<00:01:38.290> order<00:01:38.470> to<00:01:38.619> make<00:01:39.180> these

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
really care in order to make these

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.550 
really care in order to make these
running<00:01:40.990> animations<00:01:41.560> work<00:01:43.200> we<00:01:44.200> have<00:01:44.320> to<00:01:44.380> go<00:01:44.500> to

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
running animations work we have to go to

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.070 
running animations work we have to go to
our<00:01:44.740> chameleon<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:46.270> you<00:01:46.330> have<00:01:46.690> to<00:01:46.780> make<00:01:46.930> sure

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
our chameleon so you have to make sure

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.200 
our chameleon so you have to make sure
your<00:01:47.229> character<00:01:47.619> is<00:01:47.710> selected<00:01:48.250> and<00:01:48.460> then<00:01:48.940> in

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
your character is selected and then in

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.749 
your character is selected and then in
your<00:01:49.390> source<00:01:49.720> if<00:01:50.080> you<00:01:50.740> import<00:01:51.280> it<00:01:51.430> correctly

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
your source if you import it correctly

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.760 
your source if you import it correctly
and<00:01:52.150> then<00:01:52.899> you<00:01:53.050> should<00:01:53.200> just<00:01:53.320> be<00:01:53.470> able<00:01:53.560> to<00:01:53.649> go

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
and then you should just be able to go

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.420 
and then you should just be able to go
to<00:01:53.860> apes<00:01:54.039> I<00:01:54.250> khals<00:01:55.710> when<00:01:56.710> you<00:01:56.800> do<00:01:56.950> that<00:01:57.190> it'll

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
to apes I khals when you do that it'll

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.889 
to apes I khals when you do that it'll
automatically<00:01:58.259> rig<00:01:59.259> it<00:01:59.410> up<00:01:59.500> to<00:02:00.660> to<00:02:01.660> the<00:02:01.750> ape

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
automatically rig it up to to the ape

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:03.870 
automatically rig it up to to the ape
and<00:02:02.170> all<00:02:02.649> the<00:02:02.770> animations<00:02:03.220> will<00:02:03.430> just<00:02:03.670> apply

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
and all the animations will just apply

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:11.910 
and all the animations will just apply
from<00:02:04.149> there<00:02:05.280> so<00:02:06.280> that's<00:02:06.490> pretty<00:02:06.729> cool<00:02:10.769> we<00:02:11.769> need

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
from there so that's pretty cool we need

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.130 
from there so that's pretty cool we need
to<00:02:12.040> know<00:02:12.160> how<00:02:12.400> many<00:02:12.570> frames<00:02:13.570> were<00:02:13.810> in<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.019> ape

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
to know how many frames were in the ape

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:21.210 
to know how many frames were in the ape
cycle<00:02:14.680> I<00:02:15.180> think<00:02:16.180> it<00:02:16.269> was<00:02:16.360> like<00:02:16.650> 156<00:02:20.040> all<00:02:21.040> the

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
cycle I think it was like 156 all the

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.670 
cycle I think it was like 156 all the
way<00:02:21.340> to<00:02:21.400> the<00:02:21.580> shoot<00:02:21.790> yep<00:02:22.150> okay<00:02:23.519> so<00:02:24.519> now<00:02:25.450> if<00:02:26.230> we

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
way to the shoot yep okay so now if we

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.830 
way to the shoot yep okay so now if we
want<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.880> animations<00:02:28.390> to<00:02:28.540> actually

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
want the the animations to actually

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.240 
want the the animations to actually
apply<00:02:28.989> to<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:29.230> chameleon<00:02:29.680> we<00:02:29.799> have<00:02:29.920> to<00:02:30.040> bake

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
apply to the chameleon we have to bake

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.190 
apply to the chameleon we have to bake
them<00:02:30.489> in<00:02:31.799> so<00:02:32.799> go<00:02:33.640> to<00:02:33.700> your<00:02:33.880> edit<00:02:34.510> box<00:02:34.959> within

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
them in so go to your edit box within

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.949 
them in so go to your edit box within
the<00:02:35.440> character<00:02:35.709> controls<00:02:36.010> and<00:02:36.790> go<00:02:37.420> to<00:02:37.480> bake

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
the character controls and go to bake

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.600 
the character controls and go to bake
you<00:02:38.350> have<00:02:38.470> two<00:02:38.620> options<00:02:38.980> you<00:02:39.070> have<00:02:39.250> bake<00:02:39.459> to

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
you have two options you have bake to

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.340 
you have two options you have bake to
skeleton<00:02:40.120> and<00:02:40.239> bake<00:02:40.390> to<00:02:40.540> control<00:02:40.959> rig<00:02:41.200> we're

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
skeleton and bake to control rig we're

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.960 
skeleton and bake to control rig we're
going<00:02:41.470> to<00:02:41.530> bake<00:02:41.709> to<00:02:41.860> control<00:02:42.280> rig<00:02:42.489> because<00:02:42.700> we

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
going to bake to control rig because we

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.910 
going to bake to control rig because we
want<00:02:43.150> to<00:02:43.269> create<00:02:43.630> an<00:02:43.810> animation<00:02:44.170> layer<00:02:44.530> and

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
want to create an animation layer and

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.810 
want to create an animation layer and
fix<00:02:45.790> any<00:02:46.260> some<00:02:47.260> oddities<00:02:47.799> in<00:02:47.860> the<00:02:48.310> animation

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
fix any some oddities in the animation

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.250 
fix any some oddities in the animation
in<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.299> in<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:50.019> transfer<00:02:50.440> process<00:02:52.260> it's

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
in the in the transfer process it's

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.819 
in the in the transfer process it's
important<00:02:53.680> to<00:02:53.739> have<00:02:53.829> the<00:02:54.100> the<00:02:54.579> entire<00:02:55.829> cycle

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
important to have the the entire cycle

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:01.310 
important to have the the entire cycle
the<00:02:57.489> animation<00:02:58.030> cycles<00:02:58.769> within<00:02:59.769> your<00:03:00.010> your

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
the animation cycles within your your

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.449 
the animation cycles within your your
your<00:03:02.670> on<00:03:03.670> a<00:03:03.850> time<00:03:04.060> your<00:03:04.299> timeline<00:03:05.160> because<00:03:06.160> if

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
your on a time your timeline because if

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.060 
your on a time your timeline because if
it's<00:03:06.760> if<00:03:07.030> it's<00:03:07.150> at<00:03:07.390> like<00:03:07.570> from<00:03:07.959> 1<00:03:08.200> to<00:03:08.440> 60<00:03:08.890> it'll

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
it's if it's at like from 1 to 60 it'll

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.360 
it's if it's at like from 1 to 60 it'll
only<00:03:09.220> bake<00:03:09.579> the<00:03:09.850> the<00:03:10.299> keys<00:03:10.570> from<00:03:10.900> 1<00:03:11.110> to<00:03:11.260> 60<00:03:11.709> so

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
only bake the the keys from 1 to 60 so

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.180 
only bake the the keys from 1 to 60 so
here<00:03:13.329> it<00:03:13.540> baked<00:03:13.930> it<00:03:14.079> all<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:14.290> way<00:03:14.410> to<00:03:14.440> 156

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
here it baked it all the way to 156

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.660 
here it baked it all the way to 156
which<00:03:15.670> was<00:03:15.880> the<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.420> complete<00:03:17.670> animation

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
which was the the complete animation

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.000 
which was the the complete animation
cycle<00:03:19.019> so<00:03:20.019> now<00:03:20.170> what<00:03:20.380> we<00:03:20.470> can<00:03:20.590> do<00:03:20.709> is<00:03:20.829> we<00:03:20.950> can

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
cycle so now what we can do is we can

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.039 
cycle so now what we can do is we can
get<00:03:21.190> rid<00:03:21.310> of<00:03:21.340> the<00:03:21.489> ape<00:03:21.610> cycles<00:03:22.150> we<00:03:22.780> can<00:03:22.900> just

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
get rid of the ape cycles we can just

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:27.309 
get rid of the ape cycles we can just
highlight<00:03:23.410> them<00:03:23.739> and<00:03:23.860> delete<00:03:24.070> them

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.729 

and<00:03:27.819> now<00:03:28.819> our<00:03:28.969> chameleon<00:03:29.299> has<00:03:30.110> all<00:03:30.500> of<00:03:30.530> those

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
and now our chameleon has all of those

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.660 
and now our chameleon has all of those
animations<00:03:31.930> now<00:03:33.189> usually<00:03:34.189> I<00:03:34.219> would<00:03:34.370> see<00:03:34.579> it

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
animations now usually I would see it

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.550 
animations now usually I would see it
within<00:03:34.819> the<00:03:35.030> death<00:03:35.209> cycle<00:03:35.540> yeah<00:03:36.109> you<00:03:36.170> can<00:03:36.409> see

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
within the death cycle yeah you can see

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.860 
within the death cycle yeah you can see
a<00:03:36.590> little<00:03:36.829> bit<00:03:36.980> of<00:03:37.040> jittering

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
a little bit of jittering

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.360 
a little bit of jittering
where<00:03:38.870> he<00:03:39.019> kind<00:03:39.230> of<00:03:39.290> like<00:03:39.439> bounces<00:03:40.099> up<00:03:40.250> and

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
where he kind of like bounces up and

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.190 
where he kind of like bounces up and
down<00:03:40.489> and<00:03:40.969> it<00:03:41.269> just<00:03:41.450> doesn't<00:03:41.629> it<00:03:41.810> doesn't<00:03:41.840> look

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
down and it just doesn't it doesn't look

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.280 
down and it just doesn't it doesn't look
fully<00:03:42.439> right<00:03:43.450> for<00:03:44.450> this<00:03:44.569> particular<00:03:45.019> one<00:03:45.140> we

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
fully right for this particular one we

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.319 
fully right for this particular one we
don't<00:03:45.379> use<00:03:45.680> the<00:03:45.890> the<00:03:46.220> death<00:03:46.400> cycle<00:03:46.849> but<00:03:47.120> um

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
don't use the the death cycle but um

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.030 
don't use the the death cycle but um
it's<00:03:47.840> still<00:03:47.959> good<00:03:48.290> to<00:03:48.319> know<00:03:48.590> how<00:03:48.799> to<00:03:48.859> use

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
it's still good to know how to use

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.099 
it's still good to know how to use
animation<00:03:49.579> layers<00:03:49.790> and<00:03:50.209> we'll<00:03:50.720> go<00:03:50.870> into<00:03:51.019> that

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 
animation layers and we'll go into that

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:53.530 
animation layers and we'll go into that
next
