00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.620
 but what do we add? 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:07.589
 is what we call the hero's path 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:09.480
 more enemies a goal itself 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.610
 because we definitely did not believe 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.880
 that the Inca Empire was going to be founded 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.550
 with a lout with a gold cane and this one 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.949
 nailing it on the stone saying already 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.320
 he founded the Inca empire not there or is there 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.920
 we add is mythology subject as is the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.109
 case of wild-card winchell carla does not 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.219
 we added the camach pacha 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:35.910
 there is a term of a historian Maria 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:39.239
 but if she used this one man 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.910
 called a king bed or a bed that is 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.950
 denominates the vital energy of the inka that 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.860
 some have misinterpreted it they have said 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.579
 I'm going to get a Japanese word for 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.289
 say here or as energy no but it's a 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.120
 word that oral history in the 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.210
 employment called caca mccain cameras 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.920
 and that gives no to the life force of Inca 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.090
 we also use what is the term 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.830
 tour auca 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.900
 which is when the link to supposedly 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.390
 I lost all fear and it becomes a 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.250
 total warrior and for the beginning of the 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.370
 cartoon if we use the creation of the 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.910
 world that is how life cocha and its 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.430
 two children 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.619
 inti equal i cargo hincho has a 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:21.100
 small discussion to remind the 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:22.840
 man growth tools in the 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.780
 start in the first comic that we took in 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.729
 yesterday the number one legend we did not know 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.050
 nor how to sell it we took it out for the imac 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:30.910
 comics here but on the computer there 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.890
 we had no idea how we are going 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.590
 to sell so after we are 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.020
 it happened is to go out on the streets with a 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.940
 Inca dragon in the hands and sell it 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.649
 there, as a traveling person, he does not carry 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.340
 weapons to put together that story that 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:47.110
 he does not count things and then it was the 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.150
 topic that a lady approached and said 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:53.000
 hey if you want to leave me the product fell 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.770
 and people can come to buy it not 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.600
 there is no problem because they have come to 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.600
 ask me about the dragon boys in 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.310
 the good sleeve already then that's how 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.470
 let's leave one lady then another 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.390
 person and so we have three points of 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.370
 sale not nothing more currently in 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.250
 arequipa not because we wanted to remind ourselves 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.050
 all the team and leave this copy is 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.540
 like we have not profited ourselves not for 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.070
 example in cusco in we were invited by 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.530
 the municipality of Cusco for the 100 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:21.819
 years of Machu Picchu and we were like that 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.069
 making a small report with this one 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:26.079
 about legends all that and the 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.879
 people watching the comic things 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:30.879
 impressed 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:33.129
 they knew then from almost this yesterday 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.629
 he is going to die like this and they told their children 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.430
 but I still like that they had not heard 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:39.370
 very well the story then since the 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.889
 I want as you saw, let's say the same 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.950
 theme of the school but with drawings with 

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:46.450
 powers with war then be like 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.090
 that as what attracted them a lot 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.400
 situation to the point that in many 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.700
 occasions of our exhibitions 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:57.730
 when we finish this the chibolos 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.650
 they played the brothers yesterday they arrive 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.019
 almost and I have vigor here I can fly 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.449
 I am there or here something like that and good that 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.659
 it was like we were then our 

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:09.790
 glory will reach us a child that way 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:12.370
 that stopped being goku that I will love 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.949
 hype has grown dragon ball 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.379
 but there is another generation, let's say 

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:18.939
 can adopt that image not that is 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:20.980
 national identification 

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:23.960
 I'm not Japanese anymore, I'm not American 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.450
 Now I am an Inca and I carry in my blood 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:29.180
 national pride such a thing is what 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.800
 what what our products have been 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.880
 converted we were not in the imac 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.320
 comics last year we were in the 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.260
 africa asia book also last year 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.480
 we will also be in this row and 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.330
 now in the last motto comics and we have 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.040
 finished with the stocks here we always 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.600
 Lima does not also receive a very 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.970
 nice 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.310
 what does call us a little attention 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:56.450
 It is that sometimes not even know the subject not 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:58.550
 happens or say yesterday in Inca comics in 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.740
 terrific comics and just approaching 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:03.470
 view is not widespread to say 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:06.440
 once we had the theme of the comic 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.870
 printed the first comic we turned to 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.940
 promperÃº and we told him not this that the 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.730
 theme was and it was printed that we're 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.220
 giving a lot of priority to take the 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.080
 image of Peru in the world and it was there 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.910
 where he proposed a good shred you 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.620
 they should have the country brand that 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.620
 only two years ago this 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.840
 we were with purple hair gel for her 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.580
 this one for san diego we said let's go to the 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.830
 comedian obviously had more things 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.390
 defined only we grab a one of 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.670
 the painted designs that had been made 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.710
 the rapids and reproduce thousand units 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:39.200
 of them then those who moscow the girl 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.520
 and the luggage and when we went to USA 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.259
 we had the idea of selling it 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.819
 but when we arrived we saw that they had 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:48.169
 other people who were selling with mass to 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:52.139
 dollar 3 dollars outside and the comedian 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:54.150
 so then to sell the dollar and that 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.970
 same day the dollar is over the thousand 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.250
 units what was a little bit 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:02.400
 painful was that we realized that in 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.199
 the poster did not say or how to locate us 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:08.039
 I did a cartoon they did not do anything 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:09.840
 partner yesterday the legend and an Inca not 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:12.090
 then this one the people checked it 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.280
 let's just say for the drawing and 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.670
 for the color more not because there is a 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.590
 story behind that 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.910
 and coincidentally it was there where 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.740
 Argentines 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.150
 they approached and said good when 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.120
 you want to participate in this convention 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:28.970
 bring these comics and you will be fine 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:31.600
 received really very very very 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:34.040
 excited is not everything I believe it 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.690
 I'm about to take this plane that 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.120
 will take me to the convention more 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:41.030
 big comics I believe in the world 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.690
 Well, yesterday he arrived, maybe for his 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:45.440
 own means 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:48.020
 the idea was to have a stand of their own as 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.150
 least we had imagined it did not have 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.580
 a minute even if it's exposure so that 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.260
 they can see the comic in English and 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.169
 we can spread the culture a bit more 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.910
 Peruvian but actually we go for one 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:01.070
 with some Argentines who are the ones who 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:03.080
 are inviting you to be in a space in 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.610
 your stand and to make a small 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.389
 presentation of what the application 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:10.400
 for ipad not then this is to this 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:13.010
 is going yesterday and well we are going 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.680
 with all the confidence we are trying 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:18.650
 of how always to step on earth the boys 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.419
 from tibia with alexander ox to mamani that 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:24.530
 He was the one who approached us and said good 

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:26.870
 we like the product and 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:28.669
 we do not develop it this versions of 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.860
 books for ipad 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:35.040
 then it would be interesting 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:38.280
 to have this committee there is a legend 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:40.230
 for ipad we look at it a little bit 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:43.110
 distant because we did not know if 

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:47.280
 effectively the technology here or he 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:49.140
 could do that kind of thing but we 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.970
 He made a small demonstration with one of 

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:52.310
 the images that surprised us and we 

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:55.850
 liking 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:58.670
 then this is the business I'm not going to 

00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:00.830
 create for you and just show a 

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:03.960
 association I always tell myself this how 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:06.610
 think back I think to look for this 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:09.189
 this time I would like 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:12.129
 that is appreciated by the great this 

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:14.770
 for the great examples we have of 

00:07:12.129 --> 00:07:20.110
 comics in the world maybe marc sees the case 

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:22.510
 of image comic dark horse one you knew 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:24.220
 although we say they can see the 

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:26.620
 application and one of them can say 

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:28.440
 it 's good it's good that we're 

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:30.870
 doing things well 

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.380
 I would be very quiet not for others 

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:35.530
 places 

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:38.320
 if I see stanley to throw over because 

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:42.120
 I have a picture that is if I can put 

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:42.120
 the yesterday and better yet more marketing
