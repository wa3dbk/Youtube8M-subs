into a trunk as you can see but the new

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.889 
into a trunk as you can see but the new
growth<00:00:35.620> grows<00:00:36.309> out<00:00:36.730> of<00:00:37.000> a<00:00:37.090> base<00:00:37.270> and<00:00:37.510> it<00:00:37.629> clumps

00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:37.899 
growth grows out of a base and it clumps

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:40.080 
growth grows out of a base and it clumps
and<00:00:38.199> grows<00:00:38.770> and<00:00:39.070> that<00:00:39.100> is<00:00:39.280> exactly<00:00:39.699> what<00:00:39.940> the

sticking up on this plant and Berta
paradise<00:01:06.970> is<00:01:07.210> a<00:01:07.240> perennial<00:01:07.540> by<00:01:07.840> the<00:01:07.900> way<00:01:08.140> so<00:01:08.740> it

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
paradise is a perennial by the way so it

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.530 
paradise is a perennial by the way so it
grows<00:01:09.190> in<00:01:09.400> the<00:01:09.490> new<00:01:09.610> growth<00:01:09.850> comes<00:01:10.270> from<00:01:10.360> the

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
grows in the new growth comes from the

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.840 
grows in the new growth comes from the
bottom<00:01:10.990> it<00:01:11.170> doesn't<00:01:11.680> come<00:01:12.100> from<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:14.850> stem

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
bottom it doesn't come from the stem

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.400 
bottom it doesn't come from the stem
here<00:01:16.120> we're<00:01:16.450> putting<00:01:16.600> out<00:01:16.780> in<00:01:16.900> a<00:01:16.960> new<00:01:17.200> growth

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.410 
here we're putting out in a new growth

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.070 
here we're putting out in a new growth
it<00:01:17.620> comes<00:01:17.830> all<00:01:18.070> the<00:01:18.970> way<00:01:19.000> up<00:01:19.150> as<00:01:19.690> you<00:01:19.810> can<00:01:19.960> see

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
it comes all the way up as you can see

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.780 
it comes all the way up as you can see
there's<00:01:20.350> new<00:01:20.500> growth<00:01:20.530> coming<00:01:21.100> up<00:01:21.220> on<00:01:21.370> this<00:01:21.550> one

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
there's new growth coming up on this one

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.190 
there's new growth coming up on this one
here<00:01:22.540> and<00:01:23.400> when<00:01:24.400> the<00:01:24.520> flowers<00:01:24.970> are<00:01:25.180> spent<00:01:25.990> you

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
here and when the flowers are spent you

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.440 
here and when the flowers are spent you
just<00:01:26.410> go<00:01:26.830> all<00:01:27.160> the<00:01:27.190> way<00:01:27.490> down<00:01:27.700> and<00:01:28.060> you<00:01:28.120> cut

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
just go all the way down and you cut

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.020 
just go all the way down and you cut
those<00:01:28.720> down<00:01:28.960> there<00:01:29.650> it<00:01:29.980> might<00:01:30.280> be<00:01:30.340> easier<00:01:30.790> for

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
those down there it might be easier for

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.470 
those down there it might be easier for
you<00:01:31.150> to<00:01:31.360> use<00:01:31.750> a<00:01:31.870> Japanese<00:01:32.560> pruning<00:01:33.370> saw<00:01:33.640> if<00:01:34.180> you

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.480
