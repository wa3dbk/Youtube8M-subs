Hollow and today we're going to talk
about<00:00:05.700> ideas<00:00:06.270> to<00:00:07.109> use<00:00:07.379> for<00:00:07.799> wood<00:00:08.040> burning<00:00:09.830> when

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
about ideas to use for wood burning when

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.980 
about ideas to use for wood burning when
when<00:00:11.309> you<00:00:11.460> decide<00:00:11.880> you<00:00:12.090> want<00:00:12.300> to<00:00:12.389> do<00:00:12.570> some<00:00:12.780> wood

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
when you decide you want to do some wood

when you decide you want to do some wood
burning<00:00:13.259> one<00:00:13.710> of<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.040> best<00:00:14.580> types<00:00:14.940> of<00:00:15.269> wood

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
burning one of the best types of wood

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.170 
burning one of the best types of wood
for<00:00:16.020> wood<00:00:16.260> burning<00:00:16.500> is<00:00:16.890> called<00:00:17.220> bass<00:00:17.490> wood<00:00:17.880> and

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
for wood burning is called bass wood and

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.840 
for wood burning is called bass wood and
here<00:00:19.050> at<00:00:19.170> walnut<00:00:19.529> hollow<00:00:19.740> we<00:00:20.010> manufacture

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
here at walnut hollow we manufacture

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.050 
here at walnut hollow we manufacture
several<00:00:21.480> different<00:00:21.960> styles<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.340> shapes<00:00:23.640> of

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
several different styles and shapes of

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.370 
several different styles and shapes of
bass<00:00:24.330> wood<00:00:25.250> and<00:00:26.250> some<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:26.849> it<00:00:27.000> has<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.750> natural

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
bass wood and some of it has the natural

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.380 
bass wood and some of it has the natural
work<00:00:28.560> edge<00:00:28.890> on<00:00:29.250> it<00:00:29.279> some<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:30.090> has<00:00:30.359> a

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
work edge on it some of it has a

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.610 
work edge on it some of it has a
decorative<00:00:31.050> edge<00:00:31.410> but<00:00:32.340> this<00:00:32.910> bass<00:00:33.300> wood<00:00:33.719> is<00:00:34.079> a

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
decorative edge but this bass wood is a

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.049 
decorative edge but this bass wood is a
softer<00:00:35.340> type<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.940> wood<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.570> also<00:00:37.380> is<00:00:38.070> virtually

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
softer type of wood it also is virtually

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.979 
softer type of wood it also is virtually
grain<00:00:39.510> free<00:00:40.020> so<00:00:40.559> your<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:42.149> points<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.719> your

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
grain free so your the points of your

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.900 
grain free so your the points of your
tool<00:00:43.559> will<00:00:44.239> flow<00:00:45.239> right<00:00:45.960> over<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.739> surface<00:00:47.730> of

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
tool will flow right over the surface of

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.850 
tool will flow right over the surface of
the<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.600> wood<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.730> it<00:00:50.730> burns<00:00:51.030> very<00:00:51.239> nicely

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
the the wood and it burns very nicely

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.130 
the the wood and it burns very nicely
but<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:53.129> lot<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.550> people<00:00:53.850> have<00:00:54.300> trouble<00:00:54.600> trying

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
but a lot of people have trouble trying

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.080 
but a lot of people have trouble trying
to<00:00:55.289> figure<00:00:55.530> out<00:00:55.710> what<00:00:56.160> they're<00:00:56.340> going<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.699> put

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
to figure out what they're going to put

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.459 
to figure out what they're going to put
on<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.780> wood<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:59.629> there's<00:01:00.629> all<00:01:00.989> kinds<00:01:01.410> of

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
on to the wood so there's all kinds of

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.210 
on to the wood so there's all kinds of
books<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:02.070> are<00:01:02.219> out<00:01:02.550> on<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.390> market<00:01:04.220> that

books that are out on the market that

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.100 
books that are out on the market that
are<00:01:05.330> available<00:01:06.330> for<00:01:06.750> ideas<00:01:07.530> for<00:01:07.860> wood<00:01:08.100> burning

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
are available for ideas for wood burning

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.830 
are available for ideas for wood burning
different<00:01:10.110> pattern<00:01:10.710> books<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:12.000> show<00:01:12.420> all

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
different pattern books that show all

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.890 
different pattern books that show all
different<00:01:13.409> kinds<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:14.090> designs<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.600> can

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
different kinds of designs that you can

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.120 
different kinds of designs that you can
trace<00:01:16.490> using<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.670> graphite<00:01:18.150> paper<00:01:18.950> onto<00:01:19.950> your

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
trace using a graphite paper onto your

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.880 
trace using a graphite paper onto your
wood<00:01:20.930> there's<00:01:21.930> some<00:01:22.680> different<00:01:23.430> types<00:01:23.820> of

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
wood there's some different types of

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.850 
wood there's some different types of
designs<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.159> are<00:01:26.460> very<00:01:26.790> graphic<00:01:27.180> and<00:01:27.860> easy

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
designs that are very graphic and easy

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.300 
designs that are very graphic and easy
to<00:01:29.340> trace<00:01:29.670> on<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.900> can<00:01:31.140> also<00:01:31.320> use<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.770> stencil

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
to trace on you can also use a stencil

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.920 
to trace on you can also use a stencil
and<00:01:32.869> I<00:01:34.400> really<00:01:35.400> like<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.880> idea<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:36.420> using<00:01:36.659> a

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
and I really like the idea of using a

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.010 
and I really like the idea of using a
stencil<00:01:37.259> there's<00:01:37.650> so<00:01:37.890> many<00:01:38.070> in<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:39.020> craft

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
stencil there's so many in the craft

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.039 
stencil there's so many in the craft
stores<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:41.310> just<00:01:41.610> trace<00:01:41.970> through<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.540> pencil

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
stores you just trace through the pencil

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.859 
stores you just trace through the pencil
I<00:01:43.320> mean<00:01:43.680> through<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.070> stencil<00:01:45.060> with<00:01:45.570> your

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
I mean through the stencil with your

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.370 
I mean through the stencil with your
pencil<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.649> in<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:47.670> instance<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.750> want<00:01:49.110> to

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
pencil and in this instance I want to

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.550 
pencil and in this instance I want to
extend<00:01:49.979> my<00:01:50.189> design<00:01:50.850> past<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.840> edge<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.380> the

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
extend my design past the edge of the

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.670 
extend my design past the edge of the
stencil<00:01:53.070> so<00:01:53.610> I'll<00:01:54.119> just<00:01:54.479> use<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.899> pencil<00:01:55.380> to

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
stencil so I'll just use the pencil to

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.980 
stencil so I'll just use the pencil to
continue<00:01:56.310> drawing<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.969> lines<00:01:57.240> all<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.840> way

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
continue drawing the lines all the way

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.740 
continue drawing the lines all the way
down<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.799> bottom<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.460> wood<00:01:59.700> but<00:02:00.570> as

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
down to the bottom of the wood but as

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.969 
down to the bottom of the wood but as
you<00:02:00.960> can<00:02:01.170> see<00:02:01.729> you<00:02:02.729> can<00:02:03.000> now<00:02:03.750> my<00:02:04.079> design<00:02:04.530> from

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
you can see you can now my design from

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.639 
you can see you can now my design from
the<00:02:05.100> stencil<00:02:05.610> is<00:02:05.790> on<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.210> wood<00:02:06.420> itself<00:02:06.840> you

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
the stencil is on the wood itself you

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.910 
the stencil is on the wood itself you
can<00:02:07.860> also<00:02:08.009> use<00:02:08.520> rubber<00:02:08.940> stamps

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
can also use rubber stamps

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.580 
can also use rubber stamps
want<00:02:11.920> to<00:02:12.040> make<00:02:12.220> sure<00:02:12.550> that<00:02:12.970> the<00:02:13.810> image<00:02:14.260> that

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
want to make sure that the image that

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.900 
want to make sure that the image that
you're<00:02:15.040> putting<00:02:15.370> down<00:02:15.760> is<00:02:16.210> nice<00:02:16.870> and<00:02:17.170> clear<00:02:17.620> I

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
you're putting down is nice and clear I

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.030 
you're putting down is nice and clear I
use<00:02:18.910> a<00:02:18.940> light<00:02:19.840> ink<00:02:20.790> so<00:02:21.790> that<00:02:22.260> when<00:02:23.260> I<00:02:23.290> go<00:02:23.650> over

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
use a light ink so that when I go over

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.280 
use a light ink so that when I go over
the<00:02:24.190> lines<00:02:24.460> with<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:24.820> wood<00:02:25.150> burning<00:02:25.420> the<00:02:25.930> the

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
the lines with the wood burning the the

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.070 
the lines with the wood burning the the
lines<00:02:26.560> will<00:02:26.830> be<00:02:26.860> covered<00:02:27.460> you<00:02:28.270> don't<00:02:28.510> have<00:02:28.750> to

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
lines will be covered you don't have to

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.030 
lines will be covered you don't have to
draw<00:02:29.950> on<00:02:30.280> every<00:02:30.790> single<00:02:31.060> line<00:02:31.510> and<00:02:31.930> some<00:02:32.890> of

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
draw on every single line and some of
