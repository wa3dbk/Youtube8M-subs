but it's gonna take a little while to

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.610 
but it's gonna take a little while to
get<00:00:35.969> started<00:00:36.540> because<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:36.989> have<00:00:37.079> to<00:00:37.200> wait<00:00:37.380> for

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
get started because I have to wait for

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.860 
get started because I have to wait for
the<00:00:37.829> area<00:00:38.190> light<00:00:38.520> helmets<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.239> ship<00:00:39.480> for<00:00:39.690> them

already<00:01:15.540> have<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.560> I'm<00:01:16.860> modifying<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.880> be

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
already have and I'm modifying it to be

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.280 
already have and I'm modifying it to be
become<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.259> galaxy<00:01:20.130> patrol<00:01:20.700> tank<00:01:21.450> so<00:01:22.020> I'm

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
become a galaxy patrol tank so I'm

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.789 
become a galaxy patrol tank so I'm
probably<00:01:23.009> gonna<00:01:23.280> have<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.880> at<00:01:24.090> brick<00:01:24.360> fair

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
probably gonna have that at brick fair

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:30.859 
probably gonna have that at brick fair
so<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:26.520> can<00:01:26.700> look<00:01:26.820> out<00:01:27.030> for<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:28.549> then<00:01:29.869> what

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
so you can look out for that then what

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.620 
so you can look out for that then what
you're<00:01:31.229> seeing<00:01:31.619> right<00:01:31.890> now<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:33.060> middle<00:01:33.509> of

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
you're seeing right now is the middle of

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.660 
you're seeing right now is the middle of
the<00:01:33.750> castle<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.439> redid<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.700> statue<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.600> I

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
the castle I redid the statue and I

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.149 
the castle I redid the statue and I
worked<00:01:38.670> on<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.090> garden<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.750> little<00:01:40.020> bit<00:01:40.140> so<00:01:41.130> I

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
worked on the garden a little bit so I

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.480 
worked on the garden a little bit so I
think<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.700> looks<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:42.060> little<00:01:42.210> bit<00:01:42.420> better<00:01:42.630> and

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
think it looks a little bit better and

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.149 
think it looks a little bit better and
the<00:01:44.490> castle<00:01:45.270> will<00:01:45.630> also<00:01:46.049> be<00:01:46.200> there<00:01:46.409> I've<00:01:46.950> only
