00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
Xbox to PlayStation that's mainly for me

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:02.799 
Xbox to PlayStation that's mainly for me
because<00:01:01.369> that's<00:01:01.460> what<00:01:01.670> I'll<00:01:01.759> be<00:01:01.790> doing<00:01:02.089> I'll

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
because that's what I'll be doing I'll

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:04.780 
because that's what I'll be doing I'll
be<00:01:02.960> jumping<00:01:03.140> away<00:01:03.409> from<00:01:03.739> the<00:01:03.829> Xbox<00:01:04.280> and<00:01:04.519> moving

be jumping away from the Xbox and moving

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.359 
be jumping away from the Xbox and moving
the<00:01:04.879> ps4<00:01:05.380> I'm<00:01:06.380> pretty<00:01:06.680> sure<00:01:06.829> this<00:01:06.950> is<00:01:07.070> the<00:01:07.100> best

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
the ps4 I'm pretty sure this is the best

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.160 
the ps4 I'm pretty sure this is the best
decision<00:01:07.670> not<00:01:08.270> the<00:01:08.299> best<00:01:08.600> decision<00:01:08.720> but<00:01:09.140> a

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
decision not the best decision but a

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.140 
decision not the best decision but a
good<00:01:09.409> decision<00:01:09.680> because<00:01:09.979> it's<00:01:10.310> compensating

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
good decision because it's compensating

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.450 
good decision because it's compensating
from<00:01:11.329> me<00:01:11.479> a<00:01:11.659> gamer<00:01:12.020> I<00:01:12.380> think<00:01:13.009> it's<00:01:13.130> the<00:01:13.250> right

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
from me a gamer I think it's the right

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.639 
from me a gamer I think it's the right
direction<00:01:13.640> I<00:01:14.090> should<00:01:14.270> choose<00:01:14.479> and<00:01:14.840> pretty

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:15.649 
direction I should choose and pretty

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:17.740 
direction I should choose and pretty
much<00:01:15.799> that's<00:01:15.950> what<00:01:16.130> I'm<00:01:16.220> gonna<00:01:16.340> go<00:01:16.549> for<00:01:16.820> before

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
much that's what I'm gonna go for before

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.960 
much that's what I'm gonna go for before

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
based around that I just want to talk

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.830 
based around that I just want to talk
about<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.170> price<00:01:24.550> here<00:01:25.550> in<00:01:25.670> Australia<00:01:26.210> the

about the price here in Australia the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.899 
about the price here in Australia the
pricing<00:01:27.290> is<00:01:27.380> really<00:01:27.740> different<00:01:27.950> to<00:01:28.490> American

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
pricing is really different to American

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.360 
pricing is really different to American
I'm<00:01:29.000> not<00:01:29.180> sure<00:01:29.840> why<00:01:30.110> and<00:01:30.440> it<00:01:30.979> is<00:01:31.130> a<00:01:31.159> bit

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370 
I'm not sure why and it is a bit

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:32.710 
I'm not sure why and it is a bit
annoying<00:01:31.610> for<00:01:31.970> me<00:01:32.000> and<00:01:32.270> a<00:01:32.300> lot<00:01:32.450> of<00:01:32.479> the<00:01:32.600> people

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
annoying for me and a lot of the people

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.990 
annoying for me and a lot of the people
I've<00:01:32.900> talked<00:01:33.170> to<00:01:33.260> they<00:01:34.250> did<00:01:34.460> release<00:01:34.790> the

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
I've talked to they did release the

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.200 
I've talked to they did release the
prices<00:01:35.479> at<00:01:35.659> a<00:01:35.930> 3<00:01:36.380> for<00:01:36.590> both<00:01:36.770> consoles<00:01:37.250> ps4

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
prices at a 3 for both consoles ps4

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.860 
prices at a 3 for both consoles ps4
being<00:01:38.479> I<00:01:38.840> think<00:01:39.500> it<00:01:39.560> was<00:01:39.650> $400<00:01:40.340> 399<00:01:40.970> and<00:01:41.120> the

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:41.870 
being I think it was $400 399 and the

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.270 
being I think it was $400 399 and the
Xbox<00:01:42.290> one<00:01:42.500> being<00:01:44.320> $4.99<00:01:45.320> $500<00:01:46.010> yeah<00:01:46.159> I<00:01:46.190> think

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
Xbox one being $4.99 $500 yeah I think

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.609 
Xbox one being $4.99 $500 yeah I think
that's<00:01:46.520> what<00:01:46.640> it<00:01:46.729> was<00:01:46.850> but<00:01:47.750> here<00:01:48.049> in<00:01:48.110> Australia

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
that's what it was but here in Australia

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.570 
that's what it was but here in Australia
so<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:49.220> ps4<00:01:49.549> it<00:01:50.450> is<00:01:50.920> $549<00:01:51.920> to<00:01:52.100> pre-order<00:01:52.340> now

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
so the ps4 it is $549 to pre-order now

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.130 
so the ps4 it is $549 to pre-order now
and<00:01:53.060> for<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:53.900> Xbox<00:01:54.380> one<00:01:54.619> it<00:01:54.920> is<00:01:55.040> a<00:01:55.070> whopping

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
and for the Xbox one it is a whopping

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.450 
and for the Xbox one it is a whopping
599<00:01:57.140> dollars<00:01:57.320> so<00:01:57.740> I'm<00:01:57.890> not<00:01:58.040> sure<00:01:58.250> where<00:01:58.430> that

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
599 dollars so I'm not sure where that

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.880 
599 dollars so I'm not sure where that
extra<00:01:58.790> $150<00:01:59.659> came<00:01:59.869> from<00:02:00.080> for<00:02:00.320> both<00:02:00.470> consoles

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
extra $150 came from for both consoles

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.190 
extra $150 came from for both consoles
but<00:02:01.729> if<00:02:02.420> it's<00:02:02.630> worth<00:02:02.840> it

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
but if it's worth it

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.840 
but if it's worth it

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
the next issue with changing a console

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.140 
the next issue with changing a console
would<00:02:57.380> have<00:02:57.560> to<00:02:57.710> be<00:02:57.860> getting<00:02:58.580> used<00:02:58.760> to<00:02:58.970> the

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
would have to be getting used to the

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.120 
would have to be getting used to the
controller<00:02:59.540> and<00:02:59.810> that<00:02:59.840> I<00:03:00.080> could<00:03:00.380> say<00:03:00.590> this<00:03:00.830> for

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
controller and that I could say this for

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.210 
controller and that I could say this for
most<00:03:01.280> PlayStation<00:03:01.970> 3<00:03:02.180> years<00:03:02.360> now<00:03:02.710> the<00:03:03.710> Sony

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
most PlayStation 3 years now the Sony

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.920 
most PlayStation 3 years now the Sony
did<00:03:04.550> make<00:03:04.730> it<00:03:04.760> a<00:03:04.910> big<00:03:05.210> difference<00:03:05.630> to<00:03:05.690> their

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
did make it a big difference to their

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.140 
did make it a big difference to their
console<00:03:06.350> and<00:03:06.620> to<00:03:07.280> their<00:03:07.430> controller<00:03:07.820> so<00:03:08.090> I

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
console and to their controller so I

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.540 
console and to their controller so I
think<00:03:08.390> not<00:03:09.260> only<00:03:09.290> will<00:03:09.680> Xbox<00:03:10.070> users<00:03:10.220> making

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
think not only will Xbox users making

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.060 
think not only will Xbox users making
the<00:03:10.790> transfer<00:03:11.210> to<00:03:11.390> ps4<00:03:11.800> will<00:03:12.800> have<00:03:12.950> issues

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
the transfer to ps4 will have issues

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:14.590 
the transfer to ps4 will have issues
with<00:03:13.370> the<00:03:13.430> controller<00:03:13.760> some<00:03:14.450> of<00:03:14.480> the

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
with the controller some of the

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.560 
with the controller some of the
PlayStation<00:03:15.200> 3<00:03:15.500> users<00:03:15.860> may<00:03:16.310> also<00:03:16.340> have<00:03:16.760> slight

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
PlayStation 3 users may also have slight

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.990 
PlayStation 3 users may also have slight
issues<00:03:17.990> with<00:03:18.140> the<00:03:18.260> controller<00:03:18.620> it's<00:03:19.550> kind<00:03:19.970> of

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
issues with the controller it's kind of

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.280 
issues with the controller it's kind of
the<00:03:20.090> same<00:03:20.240> with<00:03:20.360> anything<00:03:20.570> getting<00:03:21.080> used<00:03:21.230> to

the same with anything getting used to
something<00:03:21.410> different<00:03:21.680> is<00:03:22.070> always<00:03:22.340> a<00:03:22.550> bit<00:03:23.000> of<00:03:23.090> a

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
something different is always a bit of a

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.300 
something different is always a bit of a
challenge<00:03:23.360> but<00:03:23.660> once<00:03:23.840> you<00:03:24.080> get<00:03:24.920> used<00:03:25.070> to<00:03:25.220> the

challenge but once you get used to the

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.010 
challenge but once you get used to the
basics<00:03:25.820> start<00:03:26.060> using<00:03:26.210> it<00:03:26.390> more<00:03:26.420> often<00:03:26.660> it's

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
basics start using it more often it's

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.900
