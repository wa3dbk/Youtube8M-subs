coming off the battery in a in a figure
in<00:02:09.480> average<00:02:09.810> yeah<00:02:10.710> that's<00:02:10.950> our<00:02:11.130> fault<00:02:11.310> in

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
in average yeah that's our fault in

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.150 
in average yeah that's our fault in
there<00:02:11.820> we<00:02:12.300> also<00:02:12.510> have<00:02:12.960> some<00:02:13.380> guys<00:02:13.620> out<00:02:13.890> there

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
there we also have some guys out there

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.730 
there we also have some guys out there
with<00:02:14.400> full<00:02:15.300> drives<00:02:15.660> with<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.200> dual<00:02:16.410> battery

with full drives with the dual battery

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.560 
with full drives with the dual battery
systems<00:02:17.130> we<00:02:17.310> want<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.730> be<00:02:17.820> out<00:02:17.940> of<00:02:17.970> water<00:02:18.330> to

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
systems we want to be out of water to

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.780 
systems we want to be out of water to
the<00:02:18.690> voltage<00:02:19.050> on<00:02:19.230> both<00:02:19.860> batteries<00:02:20.310> we've<00:02:20.610> got

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
the voltage on both batteries we've got

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.660 
the voltage on both batteries we've got
the<00:02:20.910> same<00:02:21.150> unit<00:02:21.510> involvement<00:02:22.320> so<00:02:22.890> simply<00:02:23.340> we

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
the same unit involvement so simply we

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.550 
the same unit involvement so simply we
can<00:02:23.820> take<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.120> voltage<00:02:24.510> from<00:02:25.140> your<00:02:25.320> start

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
can take the voltage from your start

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.770 
can take the voltage from your start
battery<00:02:25.950> we<00:02:26.490> can<00:02:26.670> also<00:02:26.850> take<00:02:27.210> the<00:02:27.390> voltage

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
battery we can also take the voltage

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.230 
battery we can also take the voltage
from<00:02:28.050> our<00:02:28.500> second<00:02:28.920> battery<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.520> we<00:02:30.060> can

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
from our second battery and we can

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.770 
from our second battery and we can
monitor<00:02:30.390> what's<00:02:30.750> happening<00:02:30.810> so<00:02:31.410> we<00:02:31.500> can<00:02:31.650> see<00:02:31.890> a

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
monitor what's happening so we can see a

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.180 
monitor what's happening so we can see a
Starcatcher<00:02:33.780> is<00:02:33.990> going<00:02:34.230> flat<00:02:34.440> that's<00:02:34.770> no<00:02:34.950> good
