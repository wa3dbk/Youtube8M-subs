 the hammer with the water well done and all 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.330
 the graphics to the maximum and why 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.460
 because there is a new map 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.300
 graphic 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:22.320
 hello everyone I missed you 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.949
 was a long time ago that I had not done 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.720
 of video so that's because all 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.880
 simply because in my life he 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.880
 happened no twists 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:39.039
 little bit everywhere so that's what made that 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.780
 it happened like that but do not you 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:43.420
 do not worry I read your 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.390
 comments I answered you because 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.370
 that I could so I'm still here 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.969
 there will always be videos 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:55.149
 there we are on internal on beta 3 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:56.530
 points of 10 points 7.0 there are 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:58.710
 figures we even know which ones 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.710
 these 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:05.030
 so I missed a lot of things but 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:08.720
 nothing nothing else nothing exceptional 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.090
 more at the level of additions finally there has been 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.370

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.600

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.130

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.050

 and video because I have not played on the 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.720

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.750
 everything that happened on the updates 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.460
 day there have been a lot of improvements and 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.869
 a lot of improvements at the level of 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:53.180
 the interface at the level of the management of 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.909
 objects there have been a lot of improvements 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.060
 on andelys shoots that's all that 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:01.880
 full of little details 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:04.159
 definitely stuff additions that 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.350
 I would not have seen but here the novelty 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.890
 of this last update that I 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.399

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:17.090
 I'm here I had to show it 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:19.519
 so here I have my little fishing stuff and we 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.170
 go to fucking shit here's control click 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.989
 that's part of the novelties 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.730
 control click and ben it's before we 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:28.160
 could the team is directly one of the 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.600
 stuff and the airlock dropped the item then 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.700
 now we can do more slides 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.950
 and bram if I want to slip the mambéré I 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.180
 can no longer sit like that okay 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.709
 but we can not do a 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.290
 okay you have to click and then do 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.340
 that ok and after that there is also a novelty 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.230
 we can do a right click 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.610
 we can either drop and click 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.709
 here either went left on the small 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.170
 screen and we can equip it here is 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.060
 had novelties like that if we support 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.040
 on g opens directly into 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.680
 Inventory seven years at the time 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.180
 we press on we arrive in the kraft 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.709
 we press on him we arrive in the 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.420
 skill and we press m when we get 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.380
 directly directly on the map 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.090
 then as you can see 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.700
 now what they are no longer at 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.040
 start in the of a survival of a 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.780
 survivor but directly in what they 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.690
 have changed little template has 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.170
 directly is more in the menu that 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.299
 it's so cool 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:21.020
 this is the map we see exactly we are 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:24.430
 So we are back on country 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:26.450
 yes I know I do a recap because 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.450
 there are many things that I do not have 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.810
 shown since my last video so the 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.240
 peach 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.600
 there must be at least a minimum 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.460
 four meters deep from that 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:44.990
 I read and there I test for the first 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:49.310
 times so I clicked I sent the 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:52.270
 cap I do not know how v but its 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.490
 track not at the moment 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.140
 so if I see that the epeat plug 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.010
 voice what do I do I pull at 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.110
 mans if it stings 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.490
 for the moment 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.490
 if I go back west 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.810
 5 I break everything 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:18.180
 according to me put together by one goes 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.180
 raise 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:24.410
 and then that stops more 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:27.470
 poor say they are fishing them you 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:31.800
 see on the bottom left I have 112 points 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:33.969
 experience put you all the means 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:43.569
 m 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:45.840
 Zizou is there or is it that there are four 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:49.020
 meters deep 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.020
 I think 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.410
 good 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:59.680
 we were talking now if I see the 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:02.610
 cap that is worth the cap kids on knows 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:06.000
 that there are fish to leave 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.000
 to fall forward 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:18.340
 good wooden so that's all for 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:21.780
 say that 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:25.860
 here I am back 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:28.009
 there will be there will be videos 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.449
 I'm happy I 

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:30.949
 I acquired a new 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:33.949
 graphics card so I'm going to be able 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:36.289
 to enjoy my videos a little better 

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:39.409
 it's true that all the videos that 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:41.899
 I did the graphics I 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:44.539
 even lower by half or more 

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:46.520
 for it to be nice to see who is 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:48.349
 no lag during shoots 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:53.509

00:05:57.939 --> 00:06:06.139
 ok beautiful we have more small definition 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:07.460

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:10.939
 you put it in your fire and you 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:13.189

 the skin sky we can equip it game can 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:29.409

 do not understand that everyone after at a 

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:05.659
 life can happen things 

00:07:03.399 --> 00:07:08.749
 there are people who do not react 

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:10.659

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:33.370
 like a lot 

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:35.139
 it does not prevent that there will always be 

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:37.240
 internal but we must not neglect 

00:07:35.139 --> 00:07:39.400
