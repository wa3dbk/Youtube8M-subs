 among the leaders there are Russians it is very 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.230
 gratifying in the competition of sports pairs and 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.699
 In general, all three first place after 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.010
 short after short program 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.440
 occupy our skaters but however 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.720
 the main intrigue is still in ice dancing 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.000
 because former partners 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.940
 Ilyins and Katsalapov now in new 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.520
 combinations in new duets act friend 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.800
 against a friend and it turns out the divorce was 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.530
 loud and in whose favor it seems and so 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.690
 and creepers, I Hamitova versed in all 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.020
 these are interlacing of these figures on fortunetelling 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.020
 intrigue 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.490
 Victoria and Nikita Elena and Ruslan in 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.860
 last season these were written in another 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.049
 combination after a sensational exchange 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.450
 Katsalapov and Sinitsina partners here 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.610
 Moscow will first appear in front of a wide 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.860
 public intrigue adds and the fact 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.869
 that in-person rivalry they will converge 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.299
 with your own former partners 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:53.060
 Elena Ilinykh and Ruslan Zhigan Shon 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:55.219
 Nikita Victoria had to go on the ice 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.679
 the first not only in the framework of the Russian 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:00.439
 rivalry but all dance 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:02.299
 tournament certainly it just added 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:04.880
 excitements besides this year for 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:07.130
 short dance compulsory spanish 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.069
 motives in music and that means on the ice 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.650
 there must be true passion than jizzle 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:15.590
 we are not much of a clock goes on 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.170
 sensations don't feel like how where can 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.090
 little by dasa which can be added so that 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.400
 such a rental and it turned out exactly 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.700
 through a little crumpled technical 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.230
 I think estimates were estimates 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.239
 the ones we deserve on 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.260
 today most sleeping 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.569
 dating 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.640
 just wanted a song instead 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.950
 after all purely to show that we are not 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.900
 We work all the same done 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.860
 but it is very good that not very 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:45.850
 strong very good 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.290
 good exhibitions were good 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:51.200
 present moment on and readiness they 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.930
 did everything they could walk the steps 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.840
 performed by Nikita Victoria awarded 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.180
 first level of support 2 as a result 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.500
 discuss fifty seven point ninety 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.810
 six hundredth points 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.750
 of course immediately remembered the grand prix 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.660
 China and Ilyins' debut dance score 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.030
 Zhiganshin and she was 3 points higher than 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.080
 the result of the clubfoot tit during 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.510
 interview yielded 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.580
 their former partners flame in mixed 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.010
 zone there is a TV with which 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.840
 can watch what's happening on the ice not 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.970
 I know right let me look at look 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.930

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.070

 colors the same spanish rhythms 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.720
 but on emotions that day they surpassed 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.420
 all after their previous start in china 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.269
 it's been only a week but not tired 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.970
 there was a trace of cattle confidence 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:51.920
 ness and ecstasy of what is happening on the ice 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.440
 need a warm up feel at all 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.150
 insane viewer support want though 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.250

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:11.610
 this is not the first start 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:14.520
 there was more self confidence then 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:17.070
 there is as the first step has already been made 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.260
 probably the second step if we talk about 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.850
 tournament in general or other Zhiganshin in 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.670

 american couple madison chop event to be 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.870

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.630
 ahead of their former partners more 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:33.330
 than 6 points Katsalapov tit on their 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.370

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.030
