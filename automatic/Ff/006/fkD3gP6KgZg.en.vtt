00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
though I got new lens for my camera and

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.570 
though I got new lens for my camera and
I<00:01:15.479> have<00:01:15.630> wanted<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:16.020> lens<00:01:16.409> for<00:01:16.710> literally

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
I have wanted this lens for literally

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.999 
I have wanted this lens for literally
three<00:01:18.090> years<00:01:18.420> I<00:01:18.600> have<00:01:18.869> finally<00:01:19.470> got<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:19.920> I

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
three years I have finally got it and I

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.800 
three years I have finally got it and I
thought<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.850> was<00:01:20.939> like<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.119> good<00:01:21.360> time<00:01:21.570> because

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
thought it was like a good time because

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.630 
thought it was like a good time because
I<00:01:21.990> had<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.290> money<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.619> if<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:23.070> didn't<00:01:23.369> get<00:01:23.490> it

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
I had the money and if I didn't get it

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.520 
I had the money and if I didn't get it
now<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.570> don't<00:01:24.780> think<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:24.990> probably<00:01:25.259> would

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
now that I don't think I probably would

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.170 
now that I don't think I probably would
have<00:01:25.619> ever<00:01:25.770> gotten<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.250> because<00:01:26.400> it's<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:27.000> big

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
have ever gotten it because it's a big

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.819 
have ever gotten it because it's a big
thing<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.450> splurge<00:01:27.930> on<00:01:28.140> because<00:01:28.470> it's<00:01:28.619> pretty

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829
