mod quite easily no normally I never say

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.950 
mod quite easily no normally I never say
that<00:00:26.130> really<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:27.050> is<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:29.330> you<00:00:30.330> measured<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.750> I

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
that really the is it you measured it I

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.680 
that really the is it you measured it I
think<00:00:31.170> from<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.579> yeah<00:00:32.579> I'm<00:00:33.210> just<00:00:33.420> checking

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
think from the yeah I'm just checking

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.920 
think from the yeah I'm just checking
real<00:00:33.870> quick<00:00:34.079> so<00:00:34.559> always<00:00:35.130> double<00:00:35.430> checking<00:00:35.930> all

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
real quick so always double checking all

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.430 
real quick so always double checking all
right<00:00:38.030> all<00:00:39.030> right<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:39.719> basically<00:00:39.899> what<00:00:40.320> we're

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
right all right so basically what we're

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.139 
right all right so basically what we're
doing<00:00:40.469> now<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:41.040> we're<00:00:41.430> checking<00:00:41.670> how<00:00:41.940> we're

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
doing now is we're checking how we're

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.540 
doing now is we're checking how we're
going<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.530> fasten<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.559> front<00:00:44.040> panel<00:00:44.309> so<00:00:44.430> they

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
going to fasten the front panel so they

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.000 
going to fasten the front panel so they
wouldn't<00:00:44.730> front<00:00:45.030> down<00:00:45.239> here<00:00:45.480> on<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.469> case<00:00:46.710> or

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
wouldn't front down here on the case or

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.639 
wouldn't front down here on the case or
probably<00:00:47.820> going<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.360> if<00:00:48.780> anyone<00:00:49.140> can<00:00:49.379> see

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
probably going to and if anyone can see

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.410 
probably going to and if anyone can see
this<00:00:49.800> going<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.520> use<00:00:50.640> this<00:00:50.760> kind<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.300> screw<00:00:52.070> -

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
this going to use this kind of screw -

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.119 
this going to use this kind of screw -
well<00:00:54.420> screw<00:00:54.660> actually<00:00:55.140> through<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.500> few<00:00:55.920> holes

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
well screw actually through a few holes

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.369 
well screw actually through a few holes
that<00:00:56.219> we're<00:00:56.340> gonna<00:00:56.430> make<00:00:56.699> in<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.149> case<00:00:57.379> and

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
that we're gonna make in the case and

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.560 
that we're gonna make in the case and
we're<00:00:58.500> going<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.890> recuperate<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.850> couple

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
we're going to you recuperate a couple

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.889 
we're going to you recuperate a couple
of<00:01:00.750> holes<00:01:01.109> here<00:01:01.350> these<00:01:01.559> ones<00:01:02.539> on<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.690> same

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
of holes here these ones on the same

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.539 
of holes here these ones on the same
same<00:01:04.170> ones<00:01:04.320> this<00:01:04.619> side<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.189> then<00:01:05.400> on<00:01:05.430> the

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
same ones this side and then on the

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.179 
same ones this side and then on the
bottom<00:01:05.850> here<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.710> we're<00:01:07.710> gonna<00:01:07.799> use<00:01:07.920> those

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
bottom here so we're gonna use those

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.700 
bottom here so we're gonna use those
holes<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:09.150> might<00:01:09.330> take<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.630> little<00:01:09.869> bit

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
holes and it might take a little bit

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.740 
holes and it might take a little bit
obviously<00:01:11.189> cuz<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:11.580> think<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:12.030> those<00:01:12.240> kind<00:01:12.630> of

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
obviously cuz I think that those kind of

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.380 
obviously cuz I think that those kind of
screws<00:01:13.470> will<00:01:13.860> actually<00:01:14.280> not<00:01:14.520> be<00:01:14.700> such<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.180> big

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
screws will actually not be such a big

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.210 
screws will actually not be such a big
problem<00:01:15.570> with<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:15.960> if<00:01:16.200> it's<00:01:16.439> debunk<00:01:16.920> a

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
problem with that if it's debunk a

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.999 
problem with that if it's debunk a
little<00:01:17.700> bit<00:01:17.850> steampunk<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.890> think<00:01:19.890> that's

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
little bit steampunk I think that's

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.920 
little bit steampunk I think that's
something<00:01:20.310> else<00:01:20.430> though<00:01:20.640> steampunk<00:01:21.210> endings

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
something else though steampunk endings

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.249 
something else though steampunk endings
in<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.259> entire<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.950> mod<00:01:23.159> yes<00:01:23.670> but<00:01:24.259> you

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
in the entire of the mod yes but you

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.620 
in the entire of the mod yes but you
just<00:01:25.409> name<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.830> something<00:01:26.040> yeah<00:01:26.640> all<00:01:27.030> right<00:01:27.240> so

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
just name it something yeah all right so

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.090 
just name it something yeah all right so
we're<00:01:27.750> gonna<00:01:27.869> do<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.259> now<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.799> then<00:01:28.950> we're

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
we're gonna do that now and then we're

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.800 
we're gonna do that now and then we're
going<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.670> probably<00:01:30.680> start<00:01:31.680> cutting<00:01:32.810> parts

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
going to probably start cutting parts

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.109 
going to probably start cutting parts
out<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.250> going<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.340> drill<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.549> couple<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:36.030> holes

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
out and going to drill a couple of holes

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.350 
out and going to drill a couple of holes
we're<00:01:36.540> gonna<00:01:36.659> check<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.560> bottom<00:01:38.490> here<00:01:38.759> for

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
we're gonna check the bottom here for

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.960 
we're gonna check the bottom here for
the<00:01:39.479> holes<00:01:39.689> for<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.579> radiator<00:01:41.579> which<00:01:41.790> I've

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970

English teacher also doesn't have much
vocabulary<00:03:17.290> anyway<00:03:18.099> is<00:03:18.370> now<00:03:18.879> we<00:03:18.940> can<00:03:19.120> see<00:03:19.299> it

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:19.389 
vocabulary anyway is now we can see it

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:21.379 
vocabulary anyway is now we can see it
because<00:03:19.569> we've<00:03:19.690> got<00:03:19.780> to<00:03:19.870> be<00:03:19.959> fluent<00:03:20.319> anyway

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389

because we've got to be fluent anyway
yeah<00:03:22.389> so<00:03:22.690> we<00:03:22.989> put<00:03:23.169> this<00:03:23.260> stuff<00:03:23.470> here<00:03:23.620> and<00:03:23.739> I

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:24.129 
yeah so we put this stuff here and I

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:28.800 
yeah so we put this stuff here and I
save<00:03:24.639> it<00:03:24.790> I<00:03:24.909> said<00:03:25.180> a<00:03:25.829> motor<00:03:26.829> cooling<00:03:27.810> system

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
save it I said a motor cooling system

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.490 
save it I said a motor cooling system
system<00:03:29.500> no<00:03:29.979> no<00:03:30.220> hardware<00:03:30.970> in<00:03:31.449> this<00:03:31.870> new<00:03:32.079> stuff

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
system no no hardware in this new stuff

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.750 
system no no hardware in this new stuff
in<00:03:32.739> this<00:03:32.889> unit<00:03:33.159> in<00:03:34.060> this<00:03:34.180> case<00:03:35.459> and<00:03:36.459> now<00:03:36.549> this

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
in this unit in this case and now this

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.159 
in this unit in this case and now this
is<00:03:36.909> actually<00:03:37.180> how<00:03:37.269> we're<00:03:37.419> going<00:03:37.540> to<00:03:37.659> position

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:38.169 
is actually how we're going to position

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:39.839 
is actually how we're going to position
everything<00:03:38.319> and<00:03:38.859> I<00:03:38.889> think<00:03:39.220> this<00:03:39.370> is<00:03:39.459> probably

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:39.849 
everything and I think this is probably

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:42.719 
everything and I think this is probably
a<00:03:40.060> good<00:03:40.419> a<00:03:40.449> good<00:03:40.930> way<00:03:41.109> of<00:03:41.139> doing<00:03:41.319> everything<00:03:41.729> so

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:42.729 
a good a good way of doing everything so

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:44.640 
a good a good way of doing everything so
we<00:03:42.849> will<00:03:43.090> have<00:03:43.269> to<00:03:43.599> intake<00:03:43.870> fans<00:03:44.079> here<00:03:44.439> so

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
we will have to intake fans here so

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.050 
we will have to intake fans here so
we're<00:03:44.769> gonna<00:03:44.859> cut<00:03:45.129> out<00:03:45.250> scribble<00:03:45.669> circles

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
we're gonna cut out scribble circles

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.869 
we're gonna cut out scribble circles
there<00:03:46.239> and<00:03:46.739> then<00:03:47.739> they'll<00:03:47.949> take<00:03:48.370> air<00:03:48.609> which

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 
there and then they'll take air which

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:50.969 
there and then they'll take air which
will<00:03:49.000> be<00:03:49.180> pushed<00:03:49.479> through<00:03:49.689> the<00:03:50.139> radiator<00:03:50.739> and

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:50.979 
will be pushed through the radiator and

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:53.640 
will be pushed through the radiator and
radio<00:03:51.549> really<00:03:51.790> connected<00:03:52.479> to<00:03:52.689> the<00:03:53.199> reservoir

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
radio really connected to the reservoir

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.219 
radio really connected to the reservoir
pump<00:03:54.009> I'm<00:03:54.099> going<00:03:54.370> to<00:03:54.430> see<00:03:54.729> which<00:03:54.939> one<00:03:55.209> will<00:03:56.049> be

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:56.229 
pump I'm going to see which one will be

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:59.159 
pump I'm going to see which one will be
what<00:03:57.009> the<00:03:57.099> order<00:03:57.370> will<00:03:57.519> be<00:03:57.669> I've<00:03:58.540> never<00:03:58.900> really

00:03:59.159 --> 00:03:59.169 
what the order will be I've never really

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:01.399 
what the order will be I've never really
been<00:03:59.349> doing<00:04:00.009> much<00:04:00.189> with<00:04:00.400> water<00:04:00.790> cooling<00:04:01.120> so

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:01.409 
been doing much with water cooling so

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:04.379 
been doing much with water cooling so
it's<00:04:02.409> both<00:04:02.709> refers<00:04:03.430> to<00:04:03.519> both<00:04:03.790> our<00:04:04.000> first<00:04:04.180> time

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:04.389 
it's both refers to both our first time

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:06.300 
it's both refers to both our first time
with<00:04:04.509> water<00:04:04.689> cooling<00:04:05.019> but<00:04:05.590> at<00:04:05.799> least<00:04:05.979> for<00:04:06.159> me<00:04:06.280> a

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
with water cooling but at least for me a

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.039 
with water cooling but at least for me a
complete<00:04:06.579> system<00:04:06.879> Izone

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
complete system Izone

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:09.679 
complete system Izone
other<00:04:08.409> stuff<00:04:08.680> with<00:04:08.829> our<00:04:08.979> clean<00:04:09.220> without<00:04:09.459> this

00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:09.689 
other stuff with our clean without this

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:11.819 
other stuff with our clean without this
anyway<00:04:10.689> so<00:04:10.900> that<00:04:11.290> will<00:04:11.409> be<00:04:11.500> it

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
anyway so that will be it

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.520 
anyway so that will be it
maybe<00:04:12.819> this<00:04:12.939> will<00:04:13.030> go<00:04:13.150> a<00:04:13.180> little<00:04:13.509> bit<00:04:13.780> more<00:04:14.290> to

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
maybe this will go a little bit more to

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.110 
maybe this will go a little bit more to
the<00:04:14.650> back<00:04:14.889> if<00:04:15.159> we<00:04:15.189> had<00:04:15.430> any<00:04:15.549> to<00:04:15.609> fitting<00:04:15.909> here

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
the back if we had any to fitting here

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.270 
the back if we had any to fitting here
and<00:04:16.269> only<00:04:16.539> can<00:04:16.690> go<00:04:16.780> like<00:04:16.959> that<00:04:17.169> so<00:04:17.229> we'll<00:04:18.130> see

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
and only can go like that so we'll see

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.690 
and only can go like that so we'll see
that<00:04:18.489> but<00:04:19.060> yeah<00:04:19.209> this<00:04:19.419> works<00:04:19.690> I

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
that but yeah this works I

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.420 
that but yeah this works I
think<00:04:20.850> the<00:04:21.120> fat<00:04:21.270> will<00:04:21.420> be<00:04:21.450> emitted<00:04:21.930> a<00:04:22.380> bit<00:04:23.040> more

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
think the fat will be emitted a bit more

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.350 
think the fat will be emitted a bit more
so<00:04:24.030> it'll<00:04:24.720> be<00:04:24.840> in<00:04:24.960> taking<00:04:25.290> nicely<00:04:26.210> then<00:04:27.210> we're

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
so it'll be in taking nicely then we're

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.510 
so it'll be in taking nicely then we're
gonna<00:04:27.450> be<00:04:27.630> using<00:04:27.780> force<00:04:28.350> law<00:04:28.590> so<00:04:28.650> a<00:04:28.800> smaller

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
gonna be using force law so a smaller

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.040 
gonna be using force law so a smaller
amount<00:04:29.670> abort<00:04:29.970> as<00:04:30.090> I<00:04:30.210> said<00:04:30.420> earlier<00:04:30.720> in<00:04:30.900> the

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
amount abort as I said earlier in the

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.190 
amount abort as I said earlier in the
other<00:04:31.230> parts<00:04:31.830> of<00:04:32.040> the<00:04:32.220> case<00:04:32.430> mod<00:04:32.670> luck<00:04:33.080> so<00:04:34.080> we

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
other parts of the case mod luck so we

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.750 
other parts of the case mod luck so we
got<00:04:34.440> a<00:04:34.650> couple<00:04:34.890> of<00:04:35.130> stops<00:04:35.370> here<00:04:35.580> which<00:04:35.670> you

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
got a couple of stops here which you

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.940 
got a couple of stops here which you
might<00:04:35.910> do<00:04:36.600> away<00:04:36.810> like<00:04:37.050> you<00:04:37.170> know<00:04:37.260> the<00:04:37.680> bottom

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
might do away like you know the bottom

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.130 
might do away like you know the bottom
three<00:04:38.190> here<00:04:38.370> maybe<00:04:38.880> we<00:04:39.180> cut<00:04:39.600> them<00:04:39.750> out<00:04:39.870> so<00:04:40.050> we

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
three here maybe we cut them out so we

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.590 
three here maybe we cut them out so we
can<00:04:40.260> put<00:04:40.590> the<00:04:41.130> radio<00:04:41.640> bit<00:04:42.030> more<00:04:42.180> to<00:04:42.300> the<00:04:42.390> back

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
can put the radio bit more to the back

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.960 
can put the radio bit more to the back
we'll<00:04:43.170> see<00:04:43.350> how<00:04:43.620> I<00:04:43.650> do<00:04:43.860> that<00:04:44.130> if<00:04:44.340> we<00:04:44.610> do<00:04:44.730> that

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
we'll see how I do that if we do that

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.420 
we'll see how I do that if we do that
but<00:04:45.930> I<00:04:45.960> don't<00:04:46.140> think<00:04:46.380> it's<00:04:46.500> really<00:04:46.740> necessary

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
but I don't think it's really necessary

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.420 
but I don't think it's really necessary
all<00:04:48.330> right<00:04:48.480> that's<00:04:48.660> basically<00:04:48.930> oh<00:04:49.050> yeah<00:04:50.100> what

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
all right that's basically oh yeah what

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.740 
all right that's basically oh yeah what
night<00:04:50.670> what's<00:04:50.940> nice<00:04:51.090> here<00:04:51.120> is<00:04:51.330> that<00:04:51.510> we<00:04:51.600> can

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
night what's nice here is that we can

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.450 
night what's nice here is that we can
make<00:04:51.960> Gale<00:04:52.530> engine<00:04:52.830> tools<00:04:53.010> here<00:04:53.160> in<00:04:53.220> the<00:04:53.280> back

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
make Gale engine tools here in the back

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.760 
make Gale engine tools here in the back
that<00:04:53.670> came<00:04:54.060> with<00:04:54.180> me<00:04:54.300> that<00:04:54.960> cables<00:04:55.350> come<00:04:55.590> out

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
that came with me that cables come out

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.380 
that came with me that cables come out
here<00:04:56.220> so<00:04:56.790> that<00:04:57.060> the<00:04:57.420> cables<00:04:57.780> will<00:04:57.960> go<00:04:58.200> on<00:04:58.410> the

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
here so that the cables will go on the

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.090 
here so that the cables will go on the
Villano<00:05:00.420> out<00:05:00.660> of<00:05:00.960> this<00:05:01.110> the<00:05:01.560> amount<00:05:01.740> of<00:05:01.830> artery

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
Villano out of this the amount of artery

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.470 
Villano out of this the amount of artery
here<00:05:02.280> but<00:05:02.460> you<00:05:02.550> won't<00:05:02.640> do<00:05:02.820> this<00:05:02.940> you<00:05:03.120> can<00:05:03.270> come

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.780 
here but you won't do this you can come
out<00:05:03.630> so<00:05:03.660> that<00:05:03.870> might<00:05:04.230> be<00:05:04.260> really<00:05:04.740> nice<00:05:04.980> alright

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790

out so that might be really nice alright
that's<00:05:06.450> it<00:05:06.540> for<00:05:06.720> this<00:05:06.780> partner<00:05:12.830> so<00:05:13.830> this<00:05:14.100> is

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
that's it for this partner so this is

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.810 
that's it for this partner so this is
what<00:05:14.400> happens<00:05:14.730> if<00:05:15.030> you're<00:05:15.240> not<00:05:15.270> really

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
what happens if you're not really

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:21.230 
what happens if you're not really
careful<00:05:17.820> I<00:05:18.000> guess<00:05:18.300> or<00:05:18.680> just<00:05:19.680> if<00:05:19.980> the<00:05:20.700> the

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
careful I guess or just if the the

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.150 
careful I guess or just if the the
strength<00:05:21.630> of<00:05:21.840> the<00:05:22.290> cutting<00:05:22.770> blade<00:05:22.950> isn't

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
strength of the cutting blade isn't

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.690 
strength of the cutting blade isn't
strong<00:05:23.670> enough<00:05:23.720> then<00:05:24.720> it<00:05:25.440> just<00:05:25.700> shatters

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:26.700 
strong enough then it just shatters

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.150 
strong enough then it just shatters
shatters<00:05:27.300> or<00:05:27.840> a<00:05:27.900> ninja<00:05:28.320> student<00:05:28.710> we<00:05:28.980> don't

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 
shatters or a ninja student we don't

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.520 
shatters or a ninja student we don't
really<00:05:29.280> know<00:05:29.520> it<00:05:29.970> was<00:05:30.120> just<00:05:30.510> gone<00:05:30.720> in<00:05:30.840> really

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
really know it was just gone in really

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.590 
really know it was just gone in really
kids<00:05:31.770> go<00:05:32.370> on<00:05:32.400> a<00:05:32.550> second<00:05:33.300> yeah<00:05:34.190> alright<00:05:35.190> so<00:05:35.820> we

fastened but we do have the fan here and
you<00:05:58.380> can<00:05:58.500> see<00:05:58.590> that<00:05:58.650> we<00:05:58.770> did<00:05:58.920> only<00:05:59.250> just<00:05:59.460> use

00:05:59.690 --> 00:05:59.700 
you can see that we did only just use

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.760 
you can see that we did only just use
three<00:06:00.420> screws<00:06:00.840> here<00:06:01.020> because<00:06:01.260> we<00:06:01.590> can<00:06:01.710> have

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
three screws here because we can have

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.590 
three screws here because we can have
the<00:06:01.860> fourth<00:06:02.130> one<00:06:02.460> here<00:06:02.700> but<00:06:03.150> it's<00:06:03.270> right<00:06:03.420> next

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 
the fourth one here but it's right next

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.600 
the fourth one here but it's right next
to<00:06:03.720> this<00:06:03.900> hole<00:06:04.170> which<00:06:04.350> also<00:06:04.950> ahead<00:06:05.280> here<00:06:05.580> and

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
to this hole which also ahead here and

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.370 
to this hole which also ahead here and
we<00:06:05.790> had<00:06:05.940> enough<00:06:06.150> trouble<00:06:06.300> getting<00:06:06.960> this<00:06:07.110> whole

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 
we had enough trouble getting this whole

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.610 
we had enough trouble getting this whole
kind<00:06:08.130> of<00:06:08.220> lined<00:06:08.400> up<00:06:08.610> with<00:06:08.820> the<00:06:09.110> screw<00:06:10.110> so<00:06:10.500> we're

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 
kind of lined up with the screw so we're

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.010 
kind of lined up with the screw so we're
not<00:06:10.680> gonna<00:06:10.890> be<00:06:11.070> using<00:06:11.120> fourth<00:06:12.120> screw<00:06:12.660> but<00:06:12.810> this

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.020 
not gonna be using fourth screw but this

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.640 
not gonna be using fourth screw but this
is<00:06:13.250> tight<00:06:14.250> enough<00:06:14.520> this<00:06:14.760> is<00:06:15.050> okay<00:06:16.050> right<00:06:16.080> like

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:16.650 
is tight enough this is okay right like

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.370 
is tight enough this is okay right like
that<00:06:16.680> so<00:06:17.160> yeah<00:06:17.820> basically<00:06:18.030> that<00:06:18.450> is<00:06:18.990> the<00:06:19.110> front

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380 
that so yeah basically that is the front

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.310 
that so yeah basically that is the front
fan<00:06:19.860> as<00:06:20.130> you<00:06:20.610> can<00:06:20.760> see<00:06:21.000> this<00:06:21.600> is<00:06:21.750> the<00:06:21.840> white<00:06:22.050> LED

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:22.320 
fan as you can see this is the white LED

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.680 
fan as you can see this is the white LED
fan<00:06:22.800> so<00:06:22.950> you're<00:06:23.040> gonna<00:06:23.130> see<00:06:23.310> LEDs<00:06:23.820> now<00:06:24.180> it<00:06:24.510> kind

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:24.690 
fan so you're gonna see LEDs now it kind

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:28.160 
fan so you're gonna see LEDs now it kind
of<00:06:24.720> looks<00:06:24.780> boring<00:06:25.110> perhaps<00:06:25.500> but<00:06:26.010> with<00:06:27.170> LEDs

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.170 
of looks boring perhaps but with LEDs

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:29.780 
of looks boring perhaps but with LEDs
gonna<00:06:28.320> look<00:06:28.440> a<00:06:28.500> lot<00:06:28.710> nicer<00:06:28.950> and<00:06:29.340> we<00:06:29.460> when<00:06:29.700> we

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:29.790 
gonna look a lot nicer and we when we

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:32.250 
gonna look a lot nicer and we when we
have<00:06:29.940> a<00:06:29.970> front<00:06:30.300> panel<00:06:30.780> on<00:06:30.960> it<00:06:31.140> and<00:06:31.320> as<00:06:31.950> I

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:32.260 
have a front panel on it and as I

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.140 
have a front panel on it and as I
that<00:06:32.380> before<00:06:32.890> any<00:06:33.040> other<00:06:33.160> parts<00:06:33.550> this<00:06:34.090> is

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:34.150 
that before any other parts this is

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.510 
that before any other parts this is
gonna<00:06:34.360> meet<00:06:34.600> all<00:06:34.780> whites<00:06:35.230> I<00:06:35.650> think<00:06:36.310> it's<00:06:36.430> gonna

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:36.520 
gonna meet all whites I think it's gonna

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.110 
gonna meet all whites I think it's gonna
look<00:06:36.610> quite<00:06:36.970> okay<00:06:37.360> together<00:06:38.020> with<00:06:38.200> the<00:06:39.120> little

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.120 
look quite okay together with the little

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.060 
look quite okay together with the little
button<00:06:40.390> that<00:06:40.540> we<00:06:40.630> have<00:06:40.810> that<00:06:40.990> with<00:06:41.170> the<00:06:41.350> light

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.070 
button that we have that with the light

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:43.080 
button that we have that with the light
LED<00:06:42.490> in<00:06:42.640> there

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:43.090 
LED in there

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:44.700 
LED in there
I<00:06:43.150> think<00:06:43.450> it's<00:06:43.540> gonna<00:06:43.660> look<00:06:43.840> really<00:06:44.200> really

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:44.710 
I think it's gonna look really really

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:48.420 
I think it's gonna look really really
right<00:06:44.890> so<00:06:45.780> another<00:06:46.780> update<00:06:47.050> for<00:06:47.380> you<00:06:47.500> guys<00:06:47.530> as

you can see back here we decided to go
with<00:06:51.730> a<00:06:51.880> 120<00:06:52.540> millimeter<00:06:52.870> fan<00:06:53.110> and<00:06:53.440> what<00:06:53.920> I

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:53.950 
with a 120 millimeter fan and what I

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:57.210 
with a 120 millimeter fan and what I
just<00:06:54.160> got<00:06:54.340> out<00:06:54.490> the<00:06:54.730> kiddos<00:06:56.010> 4121<00:06:57.010> that<00:06:57.100> your

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:57.220 
just got out the kiddos 4121 that your

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.970 
just got out the kiddos 4121 that your
fan<00:06:57.430> and<00:06:57.640> we<00:06:57.790> also<00:06:57.940> drilled<00:06:58.450> the<00:06:58.660> holes<00:06:59.140> right

00:06:59.970 --> 00:06:59.980 
fan and we also drilled the holes right

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.680 
fan and we also drilled the holes right
next<00:07:00.370> to<00:07:00.460> the<00:07:00.550> rivets<00:07:00.880> we<00:07:01.030> can<00:07:01.240> I<00:07:01.270> made<00:07:01.510> sure

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:01.690 
next to the rivets we can I made sure

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.630 
next to the rivets we can I made sure
that<00:07:01.720> we<00:07:02.140> really<00:07:02.590> do<00:07:02.710> build<00:07:02.890> in<00:07:02.950> rivets<00:07:03.460> there

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:03.640 
that we really do build in rivets there

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.570 
that we really do build in rivets there
as<00:07:04.210> you<00:07:04.270> can<00:07:04.420> see<00:07:04.630> I'll<00:07:05.200> have<00:07:05.260> a<00:07:05.620> fan<00:07:06.130> grill<00:07:06.400> in

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:06.580 
as you can see I'll have a fan grill in

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.250 
as you can see I'll have a fan grill in
front<00:07:06.820> of<00:07:06.970> the<00:07:07.120> exhaust<00:07:07.630> fan<00:07:07.870> which<00:07:07.990> will<00:07:08.020> go

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:08.260 
front of the exhaust fan which will go

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.290 
front of the exhaust fan which will go
here<00:07:08.470> and<00:07:08.790> actually<00:07:09.790> that<00:07:09.910> looks<00:07:10.030> really

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:10.300 
here and actually that looks really

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:15.150 
here and actually that looks really
really<00:07:10.570> nice<00:07:11.250> instead<00:07:12.250> of<00:07:12.370> the<00:07:12.520> weird<00:07:14.160> the

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:15.160 
really nice instead of the weird the

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.170 
really nice instead of the weird the
residue<00:07:15.550> is<00:07:15.700> right<00:07:15.940> here<00:07:17.460> so<00:07:18.460> actually<00:07:18.850> we<00:07:18.970> had

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:19.180 
residue is right here so actually we had

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:23.970 
residue is right here so actually we had
first<00:07:19.480> was<00:07:20.100> thing<00:07:21.100> this<00:07:22.500> I'll<00:07:23.500> taste<00:07:23.710> like

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:23.980 
first was thing this I'll taste like

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:27.180 
first was thing this I'll taste like
that<00:07:24.220> something<00:07:24.940> yeah<00:07:25.360> so<00:07:25.990> I<00:07:26.290> think<00:07:26.770> it's<00:07:27.040> much

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:27.190 
that something yeah so I think it's much

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:29.370 
that something yeah so I think it's much
better<00:07:27.220> than<00:07:27.730> a<00:07:27.790> weird<00:07:28.540> 80<00:07:28.780> millimeter<00:07:29.170> fan

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:29.380 
better than a weird 80 millimeter fan

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.110 
better than a weird 80 millimeter fan
that<00:07:29.590> can't<00:07:29.770> even<00:07:29.950> have<00:07:30.160> much<00:07:30.460> exalt<00:07:30.850> because

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.120 
that can't even have much exalt because

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.410 
that can't even have much exalt because
it's<00:07:31.240> covered<00:07:31.540> by<00:07:31.690> a<00:07:31.810> metal<00:07:32.260> so<00:07:33.100> yeah<00:07:33.820> but<00:07:34.090> this

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:34.420 
it's covered by a metal so yeah but this

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:34.950 
it's covered by a metal so yeah but this
is<00:07:34.540> much<00:07:34.690> better

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:34.960 
is much better

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.750 
is much better
now<00:07:35.290> I<00:07:35.320> have<00:07:35.560> a<00:07:35.590> few<00:07:35.860> holes<00:07:36.130> here<00:07:36.400> because<00:07:36.640> of

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:36.760 
now I have a few holes here because of

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.760 
now I have a few holes here because of
the<00:07:36.880> old<00:07:37.150> they're<00:07:37.900> gonna<00:07:38.020> come<00:07:38.260> ports<00:07:38.620> and

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:38.770 
the old they're gonna come ports and

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:40.830 
the old they're gonna come ports and
stuff<00:07:38.950> like<00:07:39.070> that<00:07:39.250> the<00:07:39.340> serial<00:07:39.610> ports<00:07:39.850> they

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:40.840 
stuff like that the serial ports they

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:41.790 
stuff like that the serial ports they
might<00:07:41.020> just<00:07:41.140> fill<00:07:41.350> these<00:07:41.470> up<00:07:41.560> with<00:07:41.620> the

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:41.800 
might just fill these up with the

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.350 
might just fill these up with the
original<00:07:41.980> plates<00:07:42.430> if<00:07:42.550> they<00:07:42.640> have<00:07:42.760> them<00:07:42.940> and

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:43.360 
original plates if they have them and

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.150 
original plates if they have them and
can<00:07:43.510> glue<00:07:43.960> them<00:07:44.140> somewhere<00:07:44.500> somehow<00:07:44.860> they're

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:45.160 
can glue them somewhere somehow they're
