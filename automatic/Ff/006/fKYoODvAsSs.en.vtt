00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
benefits of the xbox live cloud so he

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.819 
benefits of the xbox live cloud so he
says<00:01:38.790> crucially<00:01:39.509> this<00:01:39.689> time<00:01:39.960> around<00:01:40.229> there's

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
more power of the cloud and what that

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.010 
more power of the cloud and what that
means<00:01:43.560> for<00:01:43.829> game<00:01:44.040> design<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.759> can<00:01:45.390> grow<00:01:45.689> and

uncapped and I think from a player's
perspective<00:01:53.130> that's<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.180> most<00:01:54.390> exciting

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810
