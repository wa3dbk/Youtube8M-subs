this<00:00:31.439> skate<00:00:31.710> looked<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.250> little<00:00:32.369> bit<00:00:32.579> different

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
this skate looked a little bit different

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.940 
this skate looked a little bit different
we<00:00:33.570> talked<00:00:33.840> about<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.200> performance<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.829> it

being<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.309> little<00:00:35.550> bit<00:00:35.640> different<00:00:36.030> but<00:00:36.120> what<00:00:36.329> do

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
being a little bit different but what do

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.630 
being a little bit different but what do
you<00:00:36.570> as<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.750> player<00:00:36.989> actually<00:00:37.230> feel<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:38.129> should

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
you as a player actually feel I should

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.190 
you as a player actually feel I should
say<00:00:38.820> first<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.329> was<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.629> little<00:00:39.870> bit<00:00:39.960> worried

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
say first I was a little bit worried

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.500 
say first I was a little bit worried
about<00:00:40.260> having<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.739> shorter<00:00:41.040> boot<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:41.790> was<00:00:42.300> really

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
about having a shorter boot I was really

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.080 
about having a shorter boot I was really
worried<00:00:42.750> about<00:00:42.870> my<00:00:43.020> ankle<00:00:43.290> support<00:00:44.000> what<00:00:45.000> I'm

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
worried about my ankle support what I'm

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.670 
worried about my ankle support what I'm
finding<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.809> skates<00:00:46.170> moving<00:00:46.500> in<00:00:46.559> all

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
finding is that the skates moving in all

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.170 
finding is that the skates moving in all
the<00:00:46.770> right<00:00:46.890> places<00:00:46.920> for<00:00:47.489> me<00:00:47.610> I'm<00:00:47.789> really<00:00:48.059> able

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
the right places for me I'm really able

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.170 
the right places for me I'm really able
to<00:00:48.420> flex<00:00:48.660> forward<00:00:49.010> you<00:00:50.010> really<00:00:50.309> get<00:00:50.700> extension

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
to flex forward you really get extension

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.060 
to flex forward you really get extension
here<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.480> then<00:00:51.989> as<00:00:52.199> I'm<00:00:52.350> pushing<00:00:52.530> off<00:00:52.800> I

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
here and then as I'm pushing off I

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.930 
here and then as I'm pushing off I
really<00:00:53.430> feel<00:00:53.579> like<00:00:53.610> I<00:00:53.789> can<00:00:55.579> so<00:00:56.579> I'm<00:00:56.640> really

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
really feel like I can so I'm really

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:08.990 
really feel like I can so I'm really
able<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.449> creat<00:00:58.350> generate<00:00:58.949> force<00:01:07.640> and<00:01:08.640> why<00:01:08.939> is

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
able to creat generate force and why is

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.270 
able to creat generate force and why is
it<00:01:09.119> important<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.689> really<00:01:10.110> get<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:11.130> get

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
it important to really get that to get

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.679 
it important to really get that to get
that<00:01:11.490> knee<00:01:11.670> bent<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.090> important<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.659> you

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
that knee bent is that important to you

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.120 
that knee bent is that important to you
when<00:01:12.869> you're<00:01:12.990> power<00:01:13.200> turning<00:01:13.619> or<00:01:13.979> you're

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
when you're power turning or you're

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.980 
when you're power turning or you're
actually<00:01:14.640> getting<00:01:14.790> in<00:01:15.030> battle<00:01:15.420> in<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.630> corner

actually getting in battle in the corner

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.109 
actually getting in battle in the corner
where<00:01:16.619> do<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.770> find<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.189> most<00:01:17.400> beneficial

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
where do you find that most beneficial

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.030 
where do you find that most beneficial
that<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.390> really<00:01:18.689> have<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:19.470> flex<00:01:19.770> 4

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
that you really have that flex 4

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.130 
that you really have that flex 4
position<00:01:20.549> absolutely<00:01:21.150> we're<00:01:21.420> getting<00:01:21.630> hit

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
position absolutely we're getting hit

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.109 
position absolutely we're getting hit
all<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.409> time<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.400> mean<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.790> be<00:01:23.909> able<00:01:24.000> to

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
all the time so I mean to be able to

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.690 
all the time so I mean to be able to
have<00:01:24.509> your<00:01:24.600> knees<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.080> flexed<00:01:25.500> position

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
have your knees in the flexed position

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.249 
have your knees in the flexed position
for<00:01:26.700> contact<00:01:27.180> in<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.420> corner<00:01:27.750> also

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
for contact in the corner also

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.590 
for contact in the corner also
accelerating<00:01:29.100> I've<00:01:29.880> never<00:01:30.119> had<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.329> skate

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
accelerating I've never had a skate

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.819 
accelerating I've never had a skate
where<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.780> can<00:01:30.900> accelerate<00:01:31.200> like<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:31.680> before

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
where I can accelerate like this before

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.230 
where I can accelerate like this before
and<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.189> think<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.520> big<00:01:32.700> part<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.150> because

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
and I think a big part of it is because

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.270 
and I think a big part of it is because
I'm<00:01:33.420> able<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.720> generate<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:34.680> much<00:01:34.829> knee<00:01:35.070> bend

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
I'm able to generate so much knee bend

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.100 
I'm able to generate so much knee bend
forward<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.880> like<00:01:36.150> skates<00:01:36.420> really<00:01:36.720> flexing

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
forward and like skates really flexing

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.929 
forward and like skates really flexing
for<00:01:37.320> me<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.979> we<00:01:38.070> see<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.280> lot<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.520> players<00:01:38.850> that

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
for me and we see a lot of players that

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.520 
for me and we see a lot of players that
when<00:01:39.270> they<00:01:39.390> get<00:01:39.540> tired<00:01:39.780> or<00:01:39.990> really<00:01:40.259> try<00:01:40.470> to

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
when they get tired or really try to

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.590 
when they get tired or really try to
accelerate<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.549> see<00:01:41.759> them<00:01:41.909> really<00:01:42.299> have<00:01:42.570> a

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
accelerate you see them really have a

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.270 
accelerate you see them really have a
tendency<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.170> bend<00:01:43.439> their<00:01:43.590> upper<00:01:43.829> body<00:01:44.040> this

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
tendency to bend their upper body this

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.249 
tendency to bend their upper body this
way<00:01:44.490> but<00:01:45.000> really<00:01:45.180> if<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.540> can<00:01:45.689> see<00:01:45.899> their<00:01:46.079> knee

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
way but really if you can see their knee

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.870 
way but really if you can see their knee
bends<00:01:46.590> never<00:01:46.829> really<00:01:47.159> change<00:01:47.430> they're<00:01:47.670> just

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
bends never really change they're just
