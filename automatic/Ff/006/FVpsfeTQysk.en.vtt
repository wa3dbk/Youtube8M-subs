00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:08.440
 signaled on just about all catwalks one 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.240
 naturelle look very touching a mega 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.160
 but if you plan to go out 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.230
 go with girlfriends or an appointment 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.090
 have fun with you and then I guess 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.160
 nevertheless a little bit of nut arrived 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.390
 that he do today with products from 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.060
 against claire 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.080
 I start with the basics and that 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.310
 is a primer 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.009
 the why is a stayer important 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.169
 because it works all the road bumps 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.240
 fine lines fade and sort of 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:33.520
 a good basis for the pale afterwards 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.600
 and everything stays beautiful for a longer time 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:40.930
 so start from the inside 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.660
 to the outside ordinary also because it 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.210
 feels pleasant and because it is for one 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.650
 more natural effect 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.270
 after we where it is time for the van 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.630
 the garden under a very natural 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:55.930
 of the time i use the home ole 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.940
 amina this format and takes care of one 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.860
 illumination effect and that is of course 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:04.330
 our will we have natural makeup 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.520
 handy when out to work all the way 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.829
 the correct use always also your hand 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.109
 like a ballet it heats the product 

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:14.640
 and then it ensures that again 

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:14.640
 more natural 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.579
 this is the ideal nature and look but 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.770
 of course we go out and therefore may 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:27.110
 the little more for me to the eyes 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.670
 I start the eyebrow something we start 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.250
 work and we do that with one 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:37.310
 eyebrow pencil you had pairs first 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:39.640
 van boog can then round off and 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.259
 then you can fill in a little 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.020
 if you and there drawn the lines 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:48.170
 then you can with the eyebrow brush 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.119
 everything into a nice stay 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.500
 now look for the ears and we will 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.200
 to do 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.880
 this eyeshadow is then a tad 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.899
 got in and that makes for one 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.899
 glamorous effect 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.740
 You should not be frightened if there are too many 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.319
 eyeshadow it applied then you can 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.509
 always blending it away with your fingers 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:10.700
 to get a moment I go to the 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.560
 insides of the eyelids 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.620
 use a lighter color both 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.319
 at the top of sandra and we will do it too 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.880
 give it more definition with a pencil 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:23.630
 You are not supposed to be an eyeliner 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:26.269
 is going to create when stop 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.819
 and broadening bit by bit 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.569
 who already give a little more character 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.209
 eye pencil 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:35.600
 is there on time the eyelashes draw 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.650
 so hereby think it 's handy to 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.260
 saw moving movements 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.319
 to make the lashes fuller and longer 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.319
 appear 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:48.540
 what if the eyes are ready time now 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.790
 and it is important to me 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.299
 pencil use because on that 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.840
 way your lipstick does not run out 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.840
 lipstick 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.160
 and follow those lips a little 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:06.310
 moon i'm going to put lip gloss on it 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:09.790
 You can do that right in the middle of her lips 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:13.210
 a blending in with your fingers and you the 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.590
 finishing touch namely the blush and the 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.690
 intention of blush is that you too 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:22.660
 accentuate here 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:25.530
 smile and curve giants makeup in 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.530
 less than 10
