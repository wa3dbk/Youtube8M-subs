now<00:00:07.740> the<00:00:08.250> easiest<00:00:08.519> way<00:00:08.700> to<00:00:08.730> my<00:00:08.910> origins<00:00:09.059> game

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
now the easiest way to my origins game

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.499 
now the easiest way to my origins game
my<00:00:09.990> opinion<00:00:10.290> is<00:00:10.440> computed<00:00:10.980> simply<00:00:11.490> because<00:00:11.969> it

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
my opinion is computed simply because it

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:13.999 
my opinion is computed simply because it
gives<00:00:12.809> such<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.049> great<00:00:13.290> award

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
gives such a great award

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.709 
gives such a great award
killing<00:00:14.429> one<00:00:14.580> Kubica<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.089> if<00:00:15.150> you<00:00:15.240> can<00:00:15.360> solo

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
killing one Kubica and if you can solo

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.050 
killing one Kubica and if you can solo
without<00:00:16.379> any<00:00:16.529> other<00:00:16.949> interference<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:17.820> not

without any other interference and not

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.679 
without any other interference and not
getting<00:00:18.300> any<00:00:18.390> cross<00:00:18.690> you<00:00:19.470> will<00:00:19.560> get

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 
getting any cross you will get

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.099 
getting any cross you will get
experience<00:00:21.769> $4,000<00:00:23.150> 1.6<00:00:24.150> million<00:00:24.390> credits<00:00:24.869> a

thousand<00:00:25.710> origin<00:00:26.010> that's<00:00:26.849> pretty<00:00:27.060> good<00:00:27.210> just

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
thousand origin that's pretty good just

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.439 
thousand origin that's pretty good just
for<00:00:27.960> about<00:00:28.070> three<00:00:29.070> minutes<00:00:29.189> of<00:00:29.490> shooting<00:00:29.609> but

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
for about three minutes of shooting but

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.749 
for about three minutes of shooting but
of<00:00:30.570> course<00:00:30.750> this<00:00:30.929> expensive<00:00:31.439> ammunition<00:00:31.980> will

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
of course this expensive ammunition will

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.940 
of course this expensive ammunition will
have<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:33.000> lose<00:00:33.120> but<00:00:33.809> this<00:00:34.020> this<00:00:34.350> here<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:34.739> the

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
have to lose but this this here is the

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.799 
have to lose but this this here is the
easiest<00:00:35.399> way<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.610> make<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.059> if<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.510> don't<00:00:36.690> have

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
easiest way to make it if you don't have

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.479 
easiest way to make it if you don't have
a<00:00:36.899> mic<00:00:37.079> there's<00:00:37.559> two<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:37.770> us<00:00:37.860> here<00:00:37.920> shooting

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
a mic there's two of us here shooting

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.160 
a mic there's two of us here shooting
and<00:00:39.140> sab<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.440> explore<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.100> spare<00:00:42.050> and<00:00:43.050> that's

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
and sab and explore the spare and that's

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.540 
and sab and explore the spare and that's
gonna<00:00:43.320> be<00:00:43.410> this<00:00:43.770> cubes<00:00:44.129> gonna<00:00:44.280> be<00:00:44.340> quite<00:00:44.520> a

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
gonna be this cubes gonna be quite a

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.580 
gonna be this cubes gonna be quite a
treatise<00:00:44.940> say<00:00:45.480> about<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.809> minute<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.230> shooting

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
treatise say about a minute of shooting

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.799 
treatise say about a minute of shooting
and<00:00:46.829> we're<00:00:47.190> gonna<00:00:47.340> get<00:00:47.550> about<00:00:47.730> 6<00:00:48.180> million<00:00:48.539> each

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
and we're gonna get about 6 million each

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.670 
and we're gonna get about 6 million each
that's<00:00:49.680> pretty<00:00:49.860> good<00:00:50.329> if<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.480> can<00:00:51.600> do<00:00:51.719> this<00:00:51.930> 20

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
that's pretty good if you can do this 20

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.119 
that's pretty good if you can do this 20
times<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.920> day

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
times a day

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.330 
times a day
that's<00:00:53.550> at<00:00:53.699> least<00:00:53.730> 12<00:00:54.210> alpha<00:00:54.390> demons<00:00:54.809> made<00:00:55.340> I'd

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
that's at least 12 alpha demons made I'd

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.420 
that's at least 12 alpha demons made I'd
say<00:00:56.670> come<00:00:57.239> on<00:00:57.390> spend<00:00:57.690> an<00:00:57.840> hour<00:00:57.930> there's<00:00:58.399> 20<00:00:59.399> of

they see little wardega 500 him for

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.219 
they see little wardega 500 him for
about<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.610> minute<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.939> shooting<00:01:06.299> plus<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.110> can

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
about a minute of shooting plus you can

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.820 
about a minute of shooting plus you can
get<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.409> prot<00:01:07.650> kills<00:01:09.500> that'll<00:01:10.500> give<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.740> an

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
get the prot kills that'll give you an

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.560 
get the prot kills that'll give you an
extra<00:01:11.210> hundred<00:01:12.470> per<00:01:13.580> cube<00:01:14.580> but<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.299> course<00:01:15.509> you

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
extra hundred per cube but of course you

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.899 
extra hundred per cube but of course you
can<00:01:15.689> eat<00:01:15.780> premium<00:01:16.170> for<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.640> because<00:01:17.640> every

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
can eat premium for that because every

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.789 
can eat premium for that because every
time<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.150> pop<00:01:18.570> your<00:01:18.720> pet<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.259> costs<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.590> engine

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
time you pop your pet it costs to engine

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.230 
time you pop your pet it costs to engine
50<00:01:20.040> iridium<00:01:20.340> if<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.490> now<00:01:20.610> have<00:01:20.700> premium<00:01:21.030> so

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
50 iridium if you now have premium so

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.100 
50 iridium if you now have premium so
that's<00:01:21.420> really<00:01:21.659> inefficient<00:01:23.509> so<00:01:24.509> yeah<00:01:24.750> if<00:01:24.990> you

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
that's really inefficient so yeah if you

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.710 
that's really inefficient so yeah if you
want<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.320> make<00:01:25.409> iridium<00:01:25.710> from<00:01:26.540> cubes

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
want to make iridium from cubes

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.330 
want to make iridium from cubes
you're<00:01:27.810> gonna<00:01:27.930> want<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.170> Cammy<00:01:28.530> them<00:01:28.740> with

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
you're gonna want to Cammy them with

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.289 
you're gonna want to Cammy them with
premium<00:01:29.700> or<00:01:30.329> duo<00:01:31.549> the<00:01:32.549> jerk<00:01:32.759> cubes<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.150> with

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
premium or duo the jerk cubes and with

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.999 
premium or duo the jerk cubes and with
someone<00:01:33.659> in<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.930> group<00:01:34.140> because<00:01:34.590> then<00:01:34.860> that

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
someone in a group because then that

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.859 
someone in a group because then that
then<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.369> gets<00:01:35.520> played<00:01:36.119> between<00:01:36.270> both<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.780> you

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
then it gets played between both of you

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.660 
then it gets played between both of you
evenly<00:01:37.200> instead<00:01:38.009> of<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.220> person<00:01:38.460> does<00:01:38.579> the

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
evenly instead of the person does the

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.640 
evenly instead of the person does the
most<00:01:38.820> damage<00:01:39.020> but<00:01:40.020> that's<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.290> for<00:01:40.320> this<00:01:40.500> bit

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
most damage but that's it for this bit

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.560 
most damage but that's it for this bit
now<00:01:40.799> okay<00:01:41.490> one<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:41.850> your<00:01:42.030> ways<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.420> make

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
now okay one of your ways to make

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.789 
now okay one of your ways to make
iridium<00:01:42.840> really<00:01:43.020> easily<00:01:43.229> is<00:01:43.470> by<00:01:43.740> killing

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
iridium really easily is by killing

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.370 
iridium really easily is by killing
crystals<00:01:44.310> these<00:01:45.270> things<00:01:45.540> right<00:01:45.750> here<00:01:45.780> they're

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
crystals these things right here they're

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.899 
crystals these things right here they're
not<00:01:46.710> really<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.040> hard<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.280> kill<00:01:47.490> they're<00:01:47.759> only

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
not really the hard to kill they're only

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.840 
not really the hard to kill they're only
here<00:01:48.119> for<00:01:48.360> K<00:01:48.600> so<00:01:48.869> if<00:01:49.560> you're<00:01:49.740> quite<00:01:50.009> knew<00:01:50.189> you

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
here for K so if you're quite knew you

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.789 
here for K so if you're quite knew you
were<00:01:51.210> actually<00:01:51.329> belt<00:01:51.630> survivors<00:01:52.170> think

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
were actually belt survivors think

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.109

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
hard to do it takes about a minute and a

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.520

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
crystallins and you can not do cubic ins

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.610 
crystallins and you can not do cubic ins
or<00:04:07.950> you<00:04:08.100> can't<00:04:08.310> access<00:04:08.580> the<00:04:08.730> maps<00:04:08.970> even<00:04:09.620> then

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
of these are half what crystallins are

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.430 
of these are half what crystallins are
except<00:04:44.400> for<00:04:44.490> the<00:04:44.580> damage<00:04:44.910> I'm<00:04:45.000> pretty<00:04:45.210> sure
