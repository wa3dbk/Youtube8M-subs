00:04:53.239 --> 00:04:53.249 
random encounters and I think yeah this

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:55.249 
random encounters and I think yeah this
is<00:04:53.369> a<00:04:53.490> close<00:04:53.729> though<00:04:54.209> the<00:04:54.719> way<00:04:54.839> it's<00:04:55.020> supposed

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:55.259 
is a close though the way it's supposed

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:56.989 
is a close though the way it's supposed
to<00:04:55.289> be<00:04:55.379> I<00:04:55.439> think<00:04:55.619> I<00:04:55.770> missed<00:04:55.979> maybe<00:04:56.459> one<00:04:56.819> or<00:04:56.969> two

00:04:56.989 --> 00:04:56.999 
to be I think I missed maybe one or two
