00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
regional integration through the

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.720 
regional integration through the
collective<00:00:24.630> exercise<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.590> intellect<00:00:26.369> and

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
collective exercise of intellect and

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.779 
collective exercise of intellect and
imagination<00:00:27.769> without<00:00:28.769> which<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.400> people

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
imagination without which a people

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.950 
imagination without which a people
cannot<00:00:30.380> begin<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.710> think<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.420> having<00:00:33.420> even<00:00:33.930> the

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
cannot begin to think of having even the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
germ of a civilization and I think the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.200 
germ of a civilization and I think the
university<00:00:37.590> became<00:00:37.739> an<00:00:38.100> excellent<00:00:38.579> rallying

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
university became an excellent rallying

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.229 
university became an excellent rallying
point<00:00:39.510> for<00:00:39.660> this<00:00:39.930> over<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.290> past<00:00:40.530> 60<00:00:41.010> years

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
point for this over the past 60 years

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.600 
point for this over the past 60 years
produced<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.420> whole<00:00:42.660> generation<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:43.590> us<00:00:43.770> who

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
produced a whole generation of us who

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.619 
produced a whole generation of us who
grew<00:00:44.940> up<00:00:45.110> from<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.410> 40s<00:00:46.950> if<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.370> like<00:00:47.640> threw

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
grew up from the 40s if you like threw

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.389 
grew up from the 40s if you like threw
away<00:00:49.590> from<00:00:50.039> town<00:00:50.280> colony<00:00:50.820> government<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.570> sell

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
away from town colony government to sell

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.990 
away from town colony government to sell
self-government<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:54.500> independence<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:56.000> now

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
self-government to independence and now

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.650 
self-government to independence and now
the<00:00:57.059> next<00:00:57.629> generation<00:00:57.859> is<00:00:58.859> taking<00:00:59.129> over<00:00:59.660> to

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
the next generation is taking over to

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.750 
the next generation is taking over to
make<00:01:00.840> sense<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.949> post-colonial<00:01:02.730> period

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
make sense of the post-colonial period

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.600 
make sense of the post-colonial period
and<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.989> university<00:01:04.650> has<00:01:04.739> been<00:01:04.860> very<00:01:05.280> active

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
and the university has been very active

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.990 
and the university has been very active
and<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.780> think<00:01:07.049> quite<00:01:07.470> effective<00:01:08.100> in<00:01:08.280> giving

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
and I think quite effective in giving

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.030 
and I think quite effective in giving
guidance

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
guidance

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.460 
guidance
it<00:01:11.610> has<00:01:12.120> to<00:01:12.300> continue<00:01:12.660> doing<00:01:13.080> this<00:01:13.260> because

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
it has to continue doing this because

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.320 
it has to continue doing this because
there<00:01:13.860> are<00:01:14.010> new<00:01:14.220> challenges<00:01:14.810> on<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:16.550> on<00:01:17.550> the

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
there are new challenges on the on the

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.810 
there are new challenges on the on the
horizon<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.170> it's<00:01:19.770> just<00:01:19.980> not<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.280> matter<00:01:20.430> of

development<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:31.020> something<00:01:31.440> that<00:01:31.590> we<00:01:31.740> have<00:01:31.860> to

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.010 
development is something that we have to

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.520 
development is something that we have to
think<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.430> seriously<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.479> we<00:01:34.170> have<00:01:34.380> to

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
think of seriously and we have to

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.370 
think of seriously and we have to
address<00:01:34.800> the<00:01:35.100> specific<00:01:35.430> needs<00:01:35.790> which<00:01:36.450> arise
