you because i have no idea but this is a

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.130 
you because i have no idea but this is a
s-video<00:02:30.280> port<00:02:30.489> and<00:02:31.090> that<00:02:31.209> you<00:02:31.299> put<00:02:31.600> on<00:02:31.630> for<00:02:32.079> an

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
s-video port and that you put on for an

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.300 
s-video port and that you put on for an
adapter<00:02:32.530> to<00:02:32.739> this<00:02:32.980> card<00:02:33.280> that<00:02:33.730> plugs<00:02:34.000> into<00:02:35.310> one
