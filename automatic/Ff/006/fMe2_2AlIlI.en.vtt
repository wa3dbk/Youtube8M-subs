you're<00:00:48.399> going<00:00:48.520> to<00:00:48.609> test<00:00:48.850> it<00:00:49.090> and<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:50.500> am<00:00:51.129> testing

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
you're going to test it and I am testing

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:54.569 
you're going to test it and I am testing
that<00:00:51.699> with<00:00:51.910> my<00:00:52.059> 50mm<00:00:52.660> 1.8<00:00:53.050> D<00:00:53.980> because<00:00:54.370> this

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
that with my 50mm 1.8 D because this

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:56.880 
that with my 50mm 1.8 D because this
camera<00:00:55.000> does<00:00:55.239> support<00:00:55.660> a<00:00:55.870> deal<00:00:56.199> ends<00:00:56.440> because

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
camera does support a deal ends because

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.310 
camera does support a deal ends because
it<00:00:57.100> has<00:00:57.219> an<00:00:57.309> autofocus<00:00:57.579> motor<00:00:58.300> in<00:00:58.660> the<00:00:59.109> body

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
it has an autofocus motor in the body

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.380 
it has an autofocus motor in the body
and<00:00:59.559> I<00:00:59.710> have<00:00:59.829> also<00:01:00.039> set<00:01:00.399> it<00:01:00.519> into<00:01:00.820> manual<00:01:01.210> so

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
and I have also set it into manual so

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.330 
and I have also set it into manual so
that<00:01:01.420> the<00:01:01.690> lens<00:01:01.899> does<00:01:02.230> not<00:01:02.440> autofocus<00:01:03.129> in

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
that the lens does not autofocus in

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.450 
that the lens does not autofocus in
between<00:01:03.789> I'm<00:01:04.180> also<00:01:04.420> going<00:01:04.720> to<00:01:04.809> show<00:01:05.050> you<00:01:05.460> the

between I'm also going to show you the

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.670 
between I'm also going to show you the
image<00:01:06.730> quality<00:01:06.970> and<00:01:07.330> all<00:01:07.480> so<00:01:07.900> see<00:01:08.110> so<00:01:08.530> I'm

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
image quality and all so see so I'm

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.480 
image quality and all so see so I'm
shooting<00:01:08.890> a<00:01:09.280> raw<00:01:09.610> image<00:01:10.240> area<00:01:10.720> is<00:01:11.140> DX<00:01:11.770> JPEG

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
shooting a raw image area is DX JPEG

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.760 
shooting a raw image area is DX JPEG
JPEG<00:01:12.940> compression<00:01:15.150> but<00:01:16.150> it's<00:01:16.360> a<00:01:16.690> 14<00:01:17.080> bit<00:01:17.260> raw

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
JPEG compression but it's a 14 bit raw

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.700 
JPEG compression but it's a 14 bit raw
and<00:01:18.960> they<00:01:19.960> see<00:01:20.140> all<00:01:20.409> and<00:01:21.329> 14<00:01:22.329> bit<00:01:22.840> wrong<00:01:23.439> so

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
and they see all and 14 bit wrong so

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.819 
and they see all and 14 bit wrong so
let's<00:01:23.950> see<00:01:24.570> how<00:01:25.570> it<00:01:25.630> goes<00:01:25.840> you<00:01:25.869> can<00:01:26.049> also<00:01:26.259> see<00:01:26.590> I

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:26.829 
let's see how it goes you can also see I

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:29.460 
let's see how it goes you can also see I
have<00:01:27.460> 200<00:01:28.090> images<00:01:28.390> right<00:01:28.810> now<00:01:28.990> so<00:01:29.380> you're

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
have 200 images right now so you're

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.639 
have 200 images right now so you're
going<00:01:29.619> to<00:01:29.680> count<00:01:30.009> that<00:01:30.159> back<00:01:30.579> whenever<00:01:31.649> we

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
going to count that back whenever we

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:36.870 
going to count that back whenever we
finish<00:01:33.570> shooting<00:01:34.570> this<00:01:34.990> over<00:01:35.500> 30<00:01:36.009> seconds<00:01:36.700> so

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
finish shooting this over 30 seconds so

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.460 
finish shooting this over 30 seconds so
I<00:01:36.909> have<00:01:37.119> my<00:01:37.329> stopwatch<00:01:37.659> here<00:01:38.049> let's<00:01:38.320> get

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
I have my stopwatch here let's get

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.859 
I have my stopwatch here let's get
started<00:01:38.920> note<00:01:39.729> that<00:01:39.759> this<00:01:40.000> is<00:01:40.180> manual<00:01:40.630> so<00:01:40.780> it

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
started note that this is manual so it

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:42.899 
started note that this is manual so it
cannot<00:01:41.049> be<00:01:41.229> absolutely<00:01:41.950> accurate<00:01:42.520> to<00:01:42.880> the

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
cannot be absolutely accurate to the

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.109 
cannot be absolutely accurate to the
frame<00:01:43.270> but<00:01:43.479> still<00:01:43.719> you<00:01:43.899> get<00:01:44.049> an<00:01:44.170> idea<00:01:44.610> ready<00:01:45.610> 1

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
frame but still you get an idea ready 1

00:01:46.119 --> 00:02:15.570 
frame but still you get an idea ready 1
2<00:01:46.450> C

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:25.780 

so<00:02:16.580> I'm<00:02:16.670> going<00:02:16.850> to<00:02:16.880> leave<00:02:17.060> now<00:02:17.830> there<00:02:21.010> so<00:02:24.790> we're

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
so I'm going to leave now there so we're

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.440 
so I'm going to leave now there so we're
taking<00:02:25.970> a<00:02:26.120> long<00:02:26.330> time<00:02:26.960> to<00:02:27.200> fill<00:02:27.440> up<00:02:27.620> the<00:02:28.450> buffer

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
taking a long time to fill up the buffer

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.930 
taking a long time to fill up the buffer
here<00:02:29.770> but<00:02:30.770> you<00:02:30.830> can<00:02:30.920> already<00:02:31.160> start<00:02:31.340> shooting

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
here but you can already start shooting

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.760 
here but you can already start shooting
I<00:02:32.000> guess<00:02:32.180> they<00:02:32.720> can<00:02:32.900> already<00:02:33.080> start<00:02:33.230> shooting

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
I guess they can already start shooting

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.970 
I guess they can already start shooting
but<00:02:34.670> we<00:02:34.850> actually<00:02:35.030> are<00:02:35.540> took<00:02:36.020> ninety-four

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
but we actually are took ninety-four

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.810 
but we actually are took ninety-four
photos<00:02:37.580> in<00:02:37.910> 30<00:02:38.600> seconds<00:02:39.260> now<00:02:39.550> let's<00:02:40.550> do<00:02:40.700> the

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
photos in 30 seconds now let's do the

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.420 
photos in 30 seconds now let's do the
math<00:02:41.080> stop<00:02:42.080> this<00:02:42.350> and<00:02:42.560> I'm<00:02:42.650> going<00:02:42.860> to<00:02:42.890> go<00:02:43.070> to<00:02:43.130> my

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
math stop this and I'm going to go to my

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:49.750 
math stop this and I'm going to go to my
calculator<00:02:44.420> and<00:02:46.300> ninety<00:02:47.300> four<00:02:47.660> shots<00:02:48.080> in<00:02:48.890> 30

seconds<00:02:55.580> which<00:02:56.270> is<00:02:56.300> about<00:02:56.950> 3.1<00:02:57.980> FPS<00:02:58.430> 3.1<00:02:59.030> FPS

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480

continuous high in a row mode a fourteen

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.100 
continuous high in a row mode a fourteen
bit<00:03:03.950> now<00:03:04.430> remember<00:03:05.150> the<00:03:05.270> no<00:03:05.510> camera<00:03:05.960> is

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
bit now remember the no camera is

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.350 
bit now remember the no camera is
designed<00:03:06.410> to<00:03:07.250> have<00:03:07.520> you<00:03:07.730> continuously

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
designed to have you continuously

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.050 
designed to have you continuously
pressing<00:03:08.660> the<00:03:08.930> shutter<00:03:09.110> button<00:03:09.310> for<00:03:10.310> thirty

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
pressing the shutter button for thirty

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.150 
pressing the shutter button for thirty
seconds<00:03:11.840> you<00:03:11.900> generally<00:03:12.350> do<00:03:12.500> not<00:03:12.530> do<00:03:12.860> that<00:03:13.010> you

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
seconds you generally do not do that you

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.480 
seconds you generally do not do that you
do<00:03:13.340> it<00:03:13.459> for<00:03:13.730> what<00:03:14.540> a<00:03:14.720> five<00:03:15.170> second<00:03:15.890> six<00:03:16.160> second

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
do it for what a five second six second

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.150 
do it for what a five second six second
at<00:03:16.670> the<00:03:17.090> max<00:03:17.360> but<00:03:18.020> generally<00:03:18.470> maybe<00:03:18.650> two<00:03:18.980> or

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
at the max but generally maybe two or

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.560 
at the max but generally maybe two or
three<00:03:19.190> seconds<00:03:19.850> because<00:03:20.090> you<00:03:20.180> just<00:03:20.330> want<00:03:20.480> to

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
three seconds because you just want to

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.930 
three seconds because you just want to
you<00:03:21.140> know<00:03:21.200> capture<00:03:21.650> the<00:03:21.770> moment<00:03:22.130> you're<00:03:22.820> not

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
you know capture the moment you're not

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.260 
you know capture the moment you're not
shooting<00:03:23.090> a<00:03:23.530> video<00:03:24.530> with<00:03:24.860> that<00:03:24.890> so<00:03:25.459> uh<00:03:25.489> when

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
shooting a video with that so uh when

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:27.780 
shooting a video with that so uh when
you<00:03:26.390> do<00:03:26.540> that

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
you do that

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.130 
you do that
let's<00:03:28.790> see<00:03:28.910> how<00:03:29.030> much<00:03:29.150> you<00:03:29.300> have<00:03:29.450> to<00:03:29.660> ninety

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
let's see how much you have to ninety

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.690 
let's see how much you have to ninety
five<00:03:30.170> here<00:03:30.680> we<00:03:31.070> will<00:03:31.190> do<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.550> calculation

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
five here we will do the calculation

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.979 
five here we will do the calculation
again<00:03:32.660> again<00:03:33.440> 14<00:03:33.890> bit<00:03:34.100> at<00:03:34.310> all<00:03:34.459> and<00:03:34.930> now<00:03:35.930> we

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
again again 14 bit at all and now we

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:38.380 
again again 14 bit at all and now we
will<00:03:36.290> not<00:03:36.410> test<00:03:36.680> it<00:03:36.890> over<00:03:37.250> five<00:03:37.700> seconds<00:03:38.209> which

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
will not test it over five seconds which

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.979 
will not test it over five seconds which
is<00:03:38.540> a<00:03:38.570> more<00:03:38.930> likely<00:03:39.170> more<00:03:39.800> practical<00:03:40.550> I<00:03:41.510> mean

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
is a more likely more practical I mean

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:43.720 
is a more likely more practical I mean
no<00:03:42.110> continuous<00:03:42.560> high<00:03:42.739> more<00:03:43.040> duration<00:03:43.580> that

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
no continuous high more duration that

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.110 
no continuous high more duration that
you<00:03:43.790> have<00:03:44.330> in<00:03:45.080> one<00:03:45.380> shutter<00:03:45.860> press<00:03:46.280> duration

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
you have in one shutter press duration

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:55.979 
you have in one shutter press duration
so<00:03:47.600> let's<00:03:47.810> get<00:03:48.020> started

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:55.989 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:03.250 

yeah<00:03:58.390> so<00:03:59.390> it<00:03:59.480> says<00:03:59.750> we<00:03:59.989> have<00:04:00.220> 320<00:04:01.220> so<00:04:01.670> 25<00:04:02.360> to<00:04:02.630> 320

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
yeah so it says we have 320 so 25 to 320

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.870 
yeah so it says we have 320 so 25 to 320
is<00:04:03.530> about<00:04:04.160> what<00:04:04.400> 25<00:04:05.060> so<00:04:06.400> let's<00:04:07.400> do<00:04:07.550> the<00:04:07.700> math

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
is about what 25 so let's do the math

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.720 
is about what 25 so let's do the math
again<00:04:08.750> so<00:04:09.080> that<00:04:09.290> now<00:04:09.530> I<00:04:10.250> don't<00:04:10.310> need<00:04:10.550> the

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
again so that now I don't need the

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.880 
again so that now I don't need the
calculator<00:04:10.970> it<00:04:11.360> now<00:04:11.570> is<00:04:11.950> about<00:04:12.950> 5<00:04:13.579> FPS<00:04:14.359> so<00:04:14.890> you

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
calculator it now is about 5 FPS so you

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.340 
calculator it now is about 5 FPS so you
know<00:04:16.010> it<00:04:16.220> has<00:04:16.250> increased<00:04:17.060> significantly<00:04:17.959> now

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
know it has increased significantly now

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.620 
know it has increased significantly now
I'm<00:04:18.380> gonna<00:04:18.650> do<00:04:18.740> the<00:04:18.860> same<00:04:19.100> test<00:04:19.550> in<00:04:20.090> a<00:04:20.360> more

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
I'm gonna do the same test in a more

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.250 
I'm gonna do the same test in a more
practical<00:04:21.350> way<00:04:21.500> in<00:04:21.890> the<00:04:22.130> Khans<00:04:22.370> way<00:04:22.640> and<00:04:23.260> we're

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
practical way in the Khans way and we're

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.490 
practical way in the Khans way and we're
going<00:04:24.350> to<00:04:24.440> do<00:04:24.620> that<00:04:24.770> in<00:04:25.610> three<00:04:26.270> seconds<00:04:26.930> now<00:04:26.990> so

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
going to do that in three seconds now so

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.480 
going to do that in three seconds now so
let's<00:04:27.890> again<00:04:28.810> reset<00:04:29.810> our<00:04:30.080> stopwatch<00:04:30.680> and<00:04:31.010> how

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
let's again reset our stopwatch and how

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.550 
let's again reset our stopwatch and how
much<00:04:31.670> we<00:04:31.850> have<00:04:32.260> now<00:04:33.550> 3:20<00:04:34.600> now<00:04:35.600> let's<00:04:36.380> get

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
much we have now 3:20 now let's get

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.500 
much we have now 3:20 now let's get
started<00:04:36.890> in<00:04:37.040> three<00:04:37.250> second<00:04:37.520> now<00:04:37.670> again<00:04:38.180> I

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
started in three second now again I

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.110 
started in three second now again I
should<00:04:39.350> you<00:04:39.950> know<00:04:40.040> stress<00:04:40.310> upon<00:04:40.580> this<00:04:40.760> fact

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
should you know stress upon this fact

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.680 
should you know stress upon this fact
that<00:04:41.680> this<00:04:42.680> cannot<00:04:43.100> be<00:04:43.280> absolute<00:04:44.030> accurate<00:04:44.540> to

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
that this cannot be absolute accurate to

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.600 
that this cannot be absolute accurate to
the<00:04:44.810> frame<00:04:45.200> number<00:04:45.620> because<00:04:46.100> I'm<00:04:46.250> doing<00:04:46.520> it

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
the frame number because I'm doing it

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:55.140 
the frame number because I'm doing it
manually<00:04:47.120> but<00:04:47.630> still<00:04:47.900> you'll<00:04:48.320> get<00:04:48.530> an<00:04:48.650> idea

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.440 

yep

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
yep

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:08.860 
yep
so<00:04:57.110> 16<00:04:57.830> frames<00:04:58.070> in<00:04:58.550> three<00:05:03.520> days<00:05:04.520> you<00:05:07.630> 16<00:05:08.630> frames

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
so 16 frames in three days you 16 frames

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.850 
so 16 frames in three days you 16 frames
in<00:05:09.230> three<00:05:09.530> so<00:05:10.010> this<00:05:10.460> is<00:05:10.670> what<00:05:11.470> Nikon<00:05:12.470> promised

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
in three so this is what Nikon promised

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.580 
in three so this is what Nikon promised
Nichkhun<00:05:13.130> promise<00:05:13.460> about<00:05:13.670> 18<00:05:14.300> in<00:05:14.840> three<00:05:14.900> we've

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
Nichkhun promise about 18 in three we've

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.800 
Nichkhun promise about 18 in three we've
got<00:05:15.770> about<00:05:16.070> 60<00:05:16.580> now<00:05:16.670> that<00:05:16.820> only<00:05:16.970> this<00:05:17.180> is<00:05:17.360> man

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
got about 60 now that only this is man

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.040 
got about 60 now that only this is man
was<00:05:18.020> so<00:05:18.200> obviously<00:05:18.650> 16<00:05:19.100> and<00:05:19.250> 18<00:05:19.460> I<00:05:19.910> own<00:05:20.120> I'll

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
was so obviously 16 and 18 I own I'll

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.650 
was so obviously 16 and 18 I own I'll
give<00:05:21.260> that<00:05:21.290> to<00:05:21.550> in<00:05:22.550> on<00:05:22.700> the<00:05:22.820> console

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
give that to in on the console

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.950 
give that to in on the console
it's<00:05:24.140> of<00:05:24.590> pretty<00:05:24.980> good<00:05:25.430> birth<00:05:26.030> rate<00:05:26.330> at<00:05:26.570> that

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
it's of pretty good birth rate at that

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.180 
it's of pretty good birth rate at that
particular<00:05:27.230> practical<00:05:27.950> time<00:05:28.190> so<00:05:28.510> 16<00:05:30.190> is

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
particular practical time so 16 is

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.360 
particular practical time so 16 is
pretty<00:05:32.000> good<00:05:32.180> in<00:05:32.420> three<00:05:33.200> seconds<00:05:33.590> now<00:05:33.770> I'm

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
pretty good in three seconds now I'm

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.010 
pretty good in three seconds now I'm
going<00:05:34.520> to<00:05:34.580> test<00:05:34.730> another<00:05:35.180> important<00:05:35.840> aspect

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
going to test another important aspect

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.820 
going to test another important aspect
is<00:05:36.470> exactly<00:05:37.130> when<00:05:37.550> the<00:05:38.450> burst<00:05:38.750> rate<00:05:39.140> the<00:05:39.410> split

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
is exactly when the burst rate the split

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.280 
is exactly when the burst rate the split
at<00:05:40.040> the<00:05:40.160> speed<00:05:40.490> starts<00:05:41.210> to<00:05:41.360> slow<00:05:41.570> down<00:05:41.630> so

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:42.290 
at the speed starts to slow down so

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.120 
at the speed starts to slow down so
let's<00:05:42.470> see<00:05:43.090> here<00:05:44.090> we<00:05:44.240> have<00:05:44.450> three<00:05:44.480> 70<00:05:45.470> shots<00:05:45.680> as

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
let's see here we have three 70 shots as

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:58.660 
let's see here we have three 70 shots as
you<00:05:46.280> can<00:05:46.460> see<00:05:46.700> and<00:05:49.090> let's<00:05:50.090> see<00:05:56.920> the<00:05:57.920> about

00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:58.670 
you can see and let's see the about

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:03.940 
you can see and let's see the about
there<00:05:59.240> so<00:05:59.990> from<00:06:00.730> 372<00:06:01.730> about<00:06:02.320> 393<00:06:03.320> which<00:06:03.800> is

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:03.950 
there so from 372 about 393 which is

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.850 
there so from 372 about 393 which is
actually<00:06:04.550> about<00:06:05.000> 23<00:06:05.840> frames

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:06.860 
actually about 23 frames

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.360 
actually about 23 frames
I'll<00:06:07.060> bubbly<00:06:08.090> I<00:06:08.750> don't<00:06:08.990> negate<00:06:09.290> about<00:06:09.650> one<00:06:10.190> or

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.370 
I'll bubbly I don't negate about one or

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.360 
I'll bubbly I don't negate about one or
two<00:06:10.580> frames<00:06:10.880> so<00:06:11.480> even<00:06:11.840> then<00:06:12.080> closer<00:06:12.560> to<00:06:12.800> 20

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370 
two frames so even then closer to 20

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.930 
two frames so even then closer to 20
frames<00:06:13.940> are<00:06:14.390> till<00:06:14.810> which<00:06:15.080> that<00:06:15.380> speed<00:06:15.940> goes

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:16.940 
frames are till which that speed goes

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.060 
frames are till which that speed goes
and<00:06:17.240> you<00:06:18.140> know<00:06:18.260> you<00:06:18.350> found<00:06:18.590> out<00:06:18.800> that<00:06:18.920> the

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.070 
and you know you found out that the

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.610 
and you know you found out that the
speed<00:06:19.400> is<00:06:19.550> in<00:06:20.420> about<00:06:20.720> three<00:06:21.050> seconds<00:06:21.470> the

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:21.620 
speed is in about three seconds the

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.220 
speed is in about three seconds the
speed<00:06:21.890> is<00:06:22.070> close<00:06:22.460> to<00:06:22.700> six<00:06:23.210> frame<00:06:23.690> per<00:06:23.900> second

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:24.230 
speed is close to six frame per second

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:28.810 
speed is close to six frame per second
in<00:06:24.380> raw<00:06:24.590> 14<00:06:25.220> bit<00:06:25.430> so<00:06:26.260> absolutely<00:06:27.260> amazing<00:06:28.130> in<00:06:28.700> a

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:28.820 
in raw 14 bit so absolutely amazing in a

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:31.119 
in raw 14 bit so absolutely amazing in a
buffer<00:06:29.180> rate<00:06:29.330> compared<00:06:29.780> to<00:06:29.960> the<00:06:30.410> d7

00:06:31.119 --> 00:06:31.129 
buffer rate compared to the d7

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:35.260 
buffer rate compared to the d7
to<00:06:31.309> 100<00:06:31.819> now<00:06:32.029> I<00:06:32.419> am<00:06:32.749> going<00:06:33.110> do<00:06:33.830> the<00:06:34.009> usual<00:06:34.849> stuff

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:35.270 
to 100 now I am going do the usual stuff

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:40.089 
to 100 now I am going do the usual stuff
I<00:06:35.479> can<00:06:35.659> go<00:06:35.839> and<00:06:36.559> do<00:06:37.369> the<00:06:38.119> raw<00:06:38.839> and<00:06:39.199> JPEG<00:06:39.229> fine

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:40.099 
I can go and do the raw and JPEG fine

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:42.459 
I can go and do the raw and JPEG fine
but<00:06:40.699> I<00:06:40.729> won't<00:06:40.999> be<00:06:41.149> to<00:06:41.389> you<00:06:41.899> know<00:06:41.989> concern<00:06:42.379> about

00:06:42.459 --> 00:06:42.469 
but I won't be to you know concern about

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:47.649 
but I won't be to you know concern about
those<00:06:42.919> obviously<00:06:43.550> goggle<00:06:43.939> s<00:06:45.759> so<00:06:46.759> the<00:06:47.539> buffer

00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:47.659 
those obviously goggle s so the buffer

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:50.229 
those obviously goggle s so the buffer
fills<00:06:47.989> up<00:06:48.229> very<00:06:48.469> quickly<00:06:49.429> in<00:06:49.639> there<00:06:49.819> which<00:06:50.059> is

00:06:50.229 --> 00:06:50.239 
fills up very quickly in there which is

00:06:50.239 --> 00:06:53.169 
fills up very quickly in there which is
of<00:06:50.599> course<00:06:51.139> expectable<00:06:51.800> and<00:06:52.459> I'm<00:06:52.759> going<00:06:52.939> to<00:06:53.029> go

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:53.179 
of course expectable and I'm going to go

00:06:53.179 --> 00:06:56.219 
of course expectable and I'm going to go
ahead<00:06:53.300> and<00:06:53.719> not<00:06:54.559> change<00:06:54.830> it<00:06:54.949> to<00:06:55.129> JPEG<00:06:55.489> fine<00:06:55.909> and

00:06:56.219 --> 00:06:56.229 
ahead and not change it to JPEG fine and

00:06:56.229 --> 00:06:59.109 
ahead and not change it to JPEG fine and
then<00:06:57.229> this<00:06:57.769> camera<00:06:58.189> will<00:06:58.279> become<00:06:58.580> a<00:06:58.759> machine

00:06:59.109 --> 00:06:59.119 
then this camera will become a machine

00:06:59.119 --> 00:07:02.100 
then this camera will become a machine
gun

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:02.110 

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:09.309 

yo<00:07:06.069> 100<00:07:07.069> JPEG<00:07:07.429> is<00:07:07.580> almost<00:07:07.999> endless<00:07:08.389> so

00:07:09.309 --> 00:07:09.319 
yo 100 JPEG is almost endless so

00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:11.980 
yo 100 JPEG is almost endless so
brilliant<00:07:09.830> buffer<00:07:10.339> compared<00:07:10.789> to<00:07:10.909> the<00:07:11.029> d70<00:07:11.839> 100

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:11.990 
brilliant buffer compared to the d70 100

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:14.649 
brilliant buffer compared to the d70 100
thank<00:07:12.529> you
