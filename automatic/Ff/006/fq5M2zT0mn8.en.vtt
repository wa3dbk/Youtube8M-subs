00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
and add some more and as I apply this

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.050 
and add some more and as I apply this
it's<00:02:23.470> obviously<00:02:23.830> way<00:02:24.040> too<00:02:24.070> much<00:02:24.460> I<00:02:24.700> can<00:02:24.880> tone

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
it's obviously way too much I can tone

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.470 
it's obviously way too much I can tone
it<00:02:25.090> down<00:02:25.240> after<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:25.900> fact<00:02:27.180> but<00:02:28.180> I'm<00:02:28.300> going<00:02:28.420> to

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
it down after the fact but I'm going to

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.030 
it down after the fact but I'm going to
keep<00:02:28.540> it<00:02:28.840> pretty<00:02:29.110> warm<00:02:29.470> because<00:02:29.680> what<00:02:29.920> I'm

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
keep it pretty warm because what I'm

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.460 
keep it pretty warm because what I'm
going<00:02:30.160> to<00:02:30.220> do<00:02:30.400> just<00:02:30.610> for<00:02:30.760> an<00:02:30.880> example<00:02:30.970> is<00:02:31.630> to

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
going to do just for an example is to

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.130 
going to do just for an example is to
cool<00:02:33.100> this<00:02:33.340> down<00:02:33.400> quite<00:02:34.030> a<00:02:34.060> bit<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.840> you<00:02:34.959> can

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
cool this down quite a bit and you can

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.310 
cool this down quite a bit and you can
see<00:02:35.320> that<00:02:35.350> I<00:02:35.530> can<00:02:35.620> take<00:02:36.130> out<00:02:36.340> almost<00:02:36.820> all<00:02:37.320> of

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
see that I can take out almost all of

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.340 
see that I can take out almost all of
that<00:02:38.560> outside<00:02:39.550> background<00:02:40.270> and<00:02:40.540> keep<00:02:41.410> them

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
that outside background and keep them

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.410 
that outside background and keep them
looking<00:02:44.350> still<00:02:44.800> fairly<00:02:45.280> warm<00:02:45.760> some<00:02:46.270> of<00:02:46.360> the

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
looking still fairly warm some of the

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.640 
looking still fairly warm some of the
other<00:02:46.570> tools<00:02:46.930> I<00:02:47.230> love<00:02:47.709> with<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.400> new<00:02:48.610> one<00:02:49.650> it's

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
other tools I love with the new one it's

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.110 
other tools I love with the new one it's
not<00:02:50.830> what<00:02:50.950> I<00:02:51.010> just<00:02:51.250> did<00:02:51.430> go<00:02:52.209> back<00:02:52.420> to<00:02:52.540> color<00:02:54.120> but

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
not what I just did go back to color but

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.590 
not what I just did go back to color but
having<00:02:55.750> spot<00:02:56.320> noise<00:02:56.770> reduction<00:02:57.250> so<00:02:57.970> i<00:02:58.000> can<00:02:58.360> add

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
having spot noise reduction so i can add

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.960 
having spot noise reduction so i can add
noise<00:02:58.930> reduction<00:02:59.410> for<00:02:59.860> example<00:03:00.340> only<00:03:00.490> to<00:03:00.820> this

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
noise reduction for example only to this

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.160 
noise reduction for example only to this
background<00:03:01.240> area<00:03:01.810> i<00:03:03.570> actually<00:03:04.570> added

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
background area i actually added

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.440 
background area i actually added
temperature<00:03:05.620> as<00:03:05.830> well<00:03:06.060> but<00:03:07.060> this<00:03:07.209> background

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
temperature as well but this background

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.870 
temperature as well but this background
area<00:03:07.840> that's<00:03:08.140> actually<00:03:08.890> very<00:03:08.920> blurred<00:03:09.730> out

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
area that's actually very blurred out

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.979 
area that's actually very blurred out
anyway<00:03:10.420> I<00:03:10.660> don't<00:03:11.260> mind<00:03:11.470> adding<00:03:11.950> increased

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
anyway I don't mind adding increased

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.630 
anyway I don't mind adding increased
noise<00:03:13.989> reduction<00:03:14.410> into<00:03:14.920> those<00:03:15.070> areas<00:03:15.100> it's

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
noise reduction into those areas it's

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.670 
noise reduction into those areas it's
not<00:03:15.790> going<00:03:15.910> to<00:03:16.000> affect<00:03:16.060> me<00:03:16.480> negatively<00:03:16.690> in<00:03:17.290> any

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
not going to affect me negatively in any

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.470 
not going to affect me negatively in any
area<00:03:18.130> and<00:03:18.340> then<00:03:18.459> if<00:03:18.580> you<00:03:18.700> were<00:03:18.820> to<00:03:18.940> zoom<00:03:19.000> into

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
area and then if you were to zoom into

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.229 
area and then if you were to zoom into
this<00:03:19.810> picture<00:03:20.110> you<00:03:20.410> wouldn't<00:03:20.709> notice<00:03:21.209> much<00:03:22.209> of

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
this picture you wouldn't notice much of

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:23.580 
this picture you wouldn't notice much of
anything<00:03:22.570> that<00:03:22.840> area<00:03:23.110> is<00:03:23.170> out<00:03:23.320> of<00:03:23.350> focus

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
anything that area is out of focus

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.290 
anything that area is out of focus
anyway<00:03:24.190> there<00:03:24.989> really<00:03:25.989> is<00:03:26.260> no<00:03:26.590> reason<00:03:26.950> not<00:03:27.400> to

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
anyway there really is no reason not to

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.320 
anyway there really is no reason not to
get<00:03:28.600> in<00:03:28.840> and<00:03:29.230> get<00:03:29.830> rid<00:03:30.070> of<00:03:30.100> every<00:03:30.489> noise<00:03:30.640> you

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
get in and get rid of every noise you

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.289 
get in and get rid of every noise you
can<00:03:31.480> see<00:03:31.630> that<00:03:31.750> i<00:03:31.810> shot<00:03:32.080> this<00:03:32.260> 1600<00:03:33.130> is<00:03:33.370> 0<00:03:33.549> so<00:03:34.180> it

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
can see that i shot this 1600 is 0 so it

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.020 
can see that i shot this 1600 is 0 so it
probably<00:03:34.540> did<00:03:34.989> need<00:03:35.170> some<00:03:35.380> cleaning<00:03:35.769> up<00:03:36.030> and

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
probably did need some cleaning up and

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.850 
probably did need some cleaning up and
if<00:03:37.510> i'm<00:03:37.660> going<00:03:37.840> to<00:03:37.930> zoom<00:03:37.959> into<00:03:38.320> these<00:03:38.590> areas

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
if i'm going to zoom into these areas

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:45.390 
if i'm going to zoom into these areas
i'll<00:03:39.640> go<00:03:39.850> to<00:03:39.910> a<00:03:40.000> darker<00:03:40.600> here<00:03:41.320> and<00:03:44.400> everything

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
i'll go to a darker here and everything

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.160 
i'll go to a darker here and everything
I<00:03:45.670> mean<00:03:45.760> looks<00:03:46.209> fine<00:03:46.450> it's<00:03:46.720> at<00:03:46.840> I<00:03:47.019> mean

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
I mean looks fine it's at I mean

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.170 
I mean looks fine it's at I mean
obviously<00:03:47.350> it's<00:03:47.860> an<00:03:47.950> out-of-focus<00:03:48.370> area<00:03:48.940> but

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
obviously it's an out-of-focus area but

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.270 
obviously it's an out-of-focus area but
it<00:03:49.480> was<00:03:49.690> able<00:03:50.019> to<00:03:50.140> clean<00:03:50.380> up<00:03:50.530> the<00:03:50.680> noise<00:03:50.890> quite

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
it was able to clean up the noise quite

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.979 
it was able to clean up the noise quite
a<00:03:51.310> bit<00:03:51.610> compared<00:03:52.180> to<00:03:52.420> some<00:03:52.780> of<00:03:52.810> the<00:03:52.930> other

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
a bit compared to some of the other

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:54.990 
a bit compared to some of the other
areas<00:03:53.350> you<00:03:53.620> can<00:03:53.739> see<00:03:53.920> a<00:03:53.950> lot<00:03:54.160> of<00:03:54.190> green<00:03:54.519> peeking

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
areas you can see a lot of green peeking

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.840 
areas you can see a lot of green peeking
in<00:03:55.150> there<00:03:55.620> not<00:03:56.620> as<00:03:56.769> much<00:03:56.980> grain<00:03:57.280> peeking<00:03:57.670> into

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
in there not as much grain peeking into

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.990 
in there not as much grain peeking into
these<00:03:58.090> sides<00:03:58.390> over<00:03:58.780> here<00:03:58.959> and<00:03:59.140> so<00:03:59.980> those<00:04:00.760> are

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
these sides over here and so those are

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.240 
these sides over here and so those are
probably<00:04:01.690> the<00:04:01.930> main<00:04:02.260> tools<00:04:02.560> that<00:04:02.860> I<00:04:02.890> would<00:04:03.100> use

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
probably the main tools that I would use

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.340 
probably the main tools that I would use
the<00:04:03.459> most<00:04:03.670> in<00:04:04.000> that<00:04:04.030> if<00:04:04.420> you<00:04:04.840> open<00:04:05.080> up<00:04:05.170> the

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
the most in that if you open up the

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.350 
the most in that if you open up the
gradient<00:04:06.040> filter<00:04:06.250> you'll<00:04:06.580> see<00:04:06.730> you<00:04:06.880> have<00:04:06.910> some

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
gradient filter you'll see you have some

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.390 
gradient filter you'll see you have some
of<00:04:07.750> those<00:04:07.989> same<00:04:08.380> ones<00:04:08.650> this<00:04:08.980> is<00:04:09.099> going<00:04:09.220> to<00:04:09.280> be

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
of those same ones this is going to be

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.940 
of those same ones this is going to be
great<00:04:09.790> for<00:04:10.599> the<00:04:10.660> gradient<00:04:11.110> filter<00:04:11.319> for

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:11.950 
great for the gradient filter for

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.340 
great for the gradient filter for
warming<00:04:12.880> up<00:04:13.060> skies<00:04:13.480> or<00:04:13.870> cooling

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
warming up skies or cooling

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.580 
warming up skies or cooling
down<00:04:14.500> skies<00:04:15.540> for<00:04:16.540> horizon<00:04:16.810> lines<00:04:17.320> and

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
down skies for horizon lines and

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.949 
down skies for horizon lines and
landscape<00:04:18.100> shots<00:04:18.370> and<00:04:19.090> see<00:04:19.300> a<00:04:19.330> lot<00:04:19.600> of<00:04:19.630> uses

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
landscape shots and see a lot of uses

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.300 
landscape shots and see a lot of uses
for<00:04:20.140> that<00:04:20.500> you<00:04:21.310> can<00:04:21.550> take<00:04:21.850> out<00:04:22.290> any<00:04:23.290> just<00:04:23.710> spot
