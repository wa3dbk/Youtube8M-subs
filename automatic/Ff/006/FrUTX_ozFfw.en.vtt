00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:09.830 
effects of barrel so obviously

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.129 
effects of barrel so obviously
everybody's<00:00:10.830> used<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.750> standard<00:00:12.750> effect

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139

so<00:00:15.809> basically<00:00:16.289> wouldn't<00:00:16.560> go<00:00:16.650> for<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:16.800> in<00:00:16.920> one

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
so basically wouldn't go for it in one

alternate<00:02:10.310> let's<00:02:10.970> have<00:02:11.120> a<00:02:11.150> look<00:02:11.300> at<00:02:11.420> the

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
alternate let's have a look at the

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.230 
alternate let's have a look at the
difference<00:02:13.090> straight<00:02:14.090> into<00:02:14.360> a<00:02:14.390> bull<00:02:14.600> I<00:02:16.240> mean

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
difference straight into a bull I mean

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:25.870 
difference straight into a bull I mean
so<00:02:18.160> what<00:02:19.160> exactly<00:02:19.340> is<00:02:19.850> the<00:02:20.000> difference<00:02:24.880> can

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
so what exactly is the difference can

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.520 
so what exactly is the difference can
you<00:02:25.910> guys<00:02:26.300> tell<00:02:28.810> maybe<00:02:29.810> I'm<00:02:29.989> blind<00:02:30.290> but<00:02:30.470> I

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
you guys tell maybe I'm blind but I
