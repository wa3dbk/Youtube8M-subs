 today I came to bring you a billboard 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.080

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.809
 installed on your device 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.530

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:47.399

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.600
 bottom is very similar to that of goal s 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.100
 I did not like it, the logic is there 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.750

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.720

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.140

 options as a transition effect between the 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.930
