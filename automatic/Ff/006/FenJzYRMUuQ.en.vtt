green Sheen to it
but<00:00:52.250> you<00:00:52.519> can't<00:00:52.760> really<00:00:52.879> see<00:00:53.149> it<00:00:53.210> when<00:00:53.300> you

apply it I think if you applied it what

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:56.110 
apply it I think if you applied it what
you<00:00:54.860> would<00:00:54.979> be<00:00:55.100> able<00:00:55.129> to<00:00:55.309> see<00:00:55.579> it<00:00:55.670> more<00:00:55.879> it's
