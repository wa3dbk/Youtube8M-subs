00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.130 

what<00:01:27.980> resolution<00:01:28.640> is<00:01:28.730> that<00:01:28.940> quarter<00:01:29.480> HD<00:01:29.990> you

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
what resolution is that quarter HD you

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.020 
what resolution is that quarter HD you
know<00:01:30.230> the<00:01:30.440> actual<00:01:30.560> resolution<00:01:30.980> I<00:01:33.820> for<00:01:34.820> Jones

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
know the actual resolution I for Jones

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.730 
know the actual resolution I for Jones
fine<00:01:35.270> yeah<00:01:35.870> I<00:01:35.900> believe<00:01:36.260> it's<00:01:36.410> a<00:01:37.270> 960<00:01:38.270> x<00:01:38.620> 54

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
fine yeah I believe it's a 960 x 54

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.560 
fine yeah I believe it's a 960 x 54
40<00:01:41.189> like<00:01:41.490> iphone<00:01:41.939> 4<00:01:42.180> plus<00:01:42.990> i<00:01:43.229> infect<00:01:43.530> alliance

what actually the spec 44 the q 8 for
the<00:01:59.600> resolution<00:02:00.229> is<00:02:00.350> also<00:02:00.650> the<00:02:00.770> fact<00:02:00.979> sheet<00:02:01.250> so

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
the resolution is also the fact sheet so

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.050 
the resolution is also the fact sheet so
they<00:02:03.020> can<00:02:03.170> give<00:02:03.290> you<00:02:03.380> jump<00:02:03.800> drive<00:02:04.040> boards<00:02:04.610> now

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
they can give you jump drive boards now

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:15.500 
they can give you jump drive boards now
as<00:02:05.600> of<00:02:05.750> today<00:02:06.020> i'll<00:02:06.200> be<00:02:06.229> posting<00:02:10.209> thank<00:02:11.209> God

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.610 

any<00:02:16.510> why<00:02:16.660> would<00:02:16.810> I<00:02:16.840> buy<00:02:17.050> one<00:02:17.290> when<00:02:17.380> I<00:02:17.440> have<00:02:17.590> a

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
any why would I buy one when I have a

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.580 
any why would I buy one when I have a
device<00:02:17.860> like<00:02:17.890> that<00:02:18.580> I<00:02:18.880> suppose<00:02:19.870> is<00:02:20.140> a<00:02:20.290> dual

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
device like that I suppose is a dual

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.530 
device like that I suppose is a dual
core<00:02:20.770> processor<00:02:20.830> this<00:02:21.430> is<00:02:21.819> actually<00:02:22.209> this<00:02:22.480> is

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
core processor this is actually this is

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.290 
core processor this is actually this is
the<00:02:22.630> nvidia<00:02:23.349> tegra<00:02:23.770> 2<00:02:24.010> process<00:02:24.400> or<00:02:24.550> note<00:02:24.700> yeah

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
the nvidia tegra 2 process or note yeah

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.170 
the nvidia tegra 2 process or note yeah
it<00:02:25.480> says<00:02:25.630> it<00:02:25.750> in<00:02:25.840> video<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:30.010> what's<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.580> you

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
it says it in video and what's the you

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:45.240 
it says it in video and what's the you

somebody does on the device here to a

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.120 
somebody does on the device here to a
droid<00:03:04.720> x<00:03:04.870> so<00:03:05.410> compared<00:03:05.740> to<00:03:05.830> another

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
droid x so compared to another

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.520 
droid x so compared to another
smartphone<00:03:06.790> leave<00:03:07.450> it<00:03:07.630> we<00:03:08.020> think<00:03:08.290> that<00:03:08.320> it<00:03:08.440> is

it<00:03:09.430> will<00:03:09.880> do<00:03:10.000> very<00:03:10.030> very<00:03:10.360> well<00:03:10.600> we've

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:10.960 
it will do very very well we've

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.260 
it will do very very well we've
increased<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.560> battery<00:03:11.980> here<00:03:12.310> is<00:03:12.460> larger

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
increased the battery here is larger

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.300 
increased the battery here is larger
than<00:03:13.420> the<00:03:13.480> droid<00:03:13.720> x<00:03:13.900> is<00:03:14.110> at<00:03:14.260> large<00:03:14.470> to<00:03:15.160> give<00:03:15.280> you

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
than the droid x is at large to give you

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.850 
than the droid x is at large to give you
an<00:03:15.430> idea<00:03:15.490> so<00:03:15.940> even<00:03:16.660> though<00:03:16.750> there's<00:03:16.959> a<00:03:17.020> 4G<00:03:17.530> you

an idea so even though there's a 4G you

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.190 
an idea so even though there's a 4G you
know<00:03:18.220> it's<00:03:18.459> dual<00:03:18.640> core<00:03:18.910> 4g<00:03:19.660> we've<00:03:19.900> increased

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
know it's dual core 4g we've increased

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.920
