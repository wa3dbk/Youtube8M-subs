00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:08.219
 vehlow 20 a practical tricycle we 

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:11.460
 we see a model with something 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:15.230
 equipped where is the tilting technology 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.230
 can drive curves without tipping over 

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:22.550
 come through a small transit 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.550
 They are wonderfully comfortable 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:44.410
 the velo 20 is on 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.970
 with electric motor support up to 25 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.440
 km / h 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.410
 You can also use one 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.809
 Driving assistance states without the pedals 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.230
 to step 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.670
 This tricycle has a 3- speed circuit 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.780
 be lower emphasis allowed 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.780
 get them a comfortable 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.810
 by the optional connection of the 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.760
 you can drive it like a side tilt 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.030
 a normal bike what the use 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.640
 enormously simplified is particularly well suited 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.830
 the video 20 to shop because they 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.950
 the two bodies with up to 47 kilo 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.230
 can burden with its compact 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.180
 measured and its narrow track width 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.410
 you can also record the video 20 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.410
 smallest room 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.740
 on the whole 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.630
 details I wanted again briefly 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.179
 say what's so great about me 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.799
 except that it just keeps small and 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:40.229
 agile and really practical too 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.380
 I find it very special to handle 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:47.069
 important so two three small cracks and 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:50.130
 Although it just stops here if 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:52.319
 you turn it backwards that you can see 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.450
 then, so to speak, on the beautiful entry 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:55.439
 conditionality can set something for me 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.069
 is very important 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:02.009
 two wonderful thing here that you hand 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:03.959
 can give gas and that next Harnik 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.380
 has for a short time as long as you can 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:09.959
 serves his own piece and gets 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.690
 you can pull yourself up or 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.540
 just stop driving sometime wonderful 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.670
 Guardian can accelerate without 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.709
 that you have to spend more energy the 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.709
 I also like the two things completely 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.269
 great team tech storage body 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.269
 here for me actually the most important 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:29.660
 at the device now I was just times 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.660
 Come on 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.760
 Now demonstrate like the tilting technique 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.480
 come wonderful and the ag 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.379
 and also up the mountain 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.180
 wonderful 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.280
 very nice
