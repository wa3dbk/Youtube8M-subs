00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
very first cruise and I think this is

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.090 
very first cruise and I think this is
expansively<00:01:00.780> bigger<00:01:01.050> than<00:01:01.320> what<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.500> remember

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
expansively bigger than what I remember

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.399

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
cruise ship rooms to look like I think I

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.070 
cruise ship rooms to look like I think I
could<00:01:04.589> touch<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.580> sides<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:06.150> both<00:01:06.330> rooms<00:01:06.689> from

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
could touch the sides of both rooms from

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.560 
could touch the sides of both rooms from
armed<00:01:07.650> arms<00:01:08.070> so<00:01:08.280> this<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.460> much<00:01:08.970> bigger<00:01:09.240> as<00:01:09.510> you
