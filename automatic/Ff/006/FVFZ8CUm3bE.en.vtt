00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
of like the spring so to speak that you

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.619 
of like the spring so to speak that you
would<00:00:39.750> need<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.260> very<00:00:41.250> complicated<00:00:41.700> toy<00:00:42.270> in<00:00:42.540> his

would need a very complicated toy in his

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.229 
would need a very complicated toy in his
design<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.020> being<00:00:43.350> alone<00:00:43.649> here<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:43.950> can't<00:00:44.309> have

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
design and being alone here I can't have

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.479 
design and being alone here I can't have
someone<00:00:45.480> demonstrate<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.440> working<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.399> it

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
someone demonstrate the working of it

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.560 
someone demonstrate the working of it
when<00:00:47.579> itself<00:00:47.910> but<00:00:48.059> we'll<00:00:48.180> walk<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.420> through

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570

it<00:00:49.789> the<00:00:50.840> the<00:00:51.840> hinges<00:00:52.230> are<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.559> course<00:00:52.850> mounted

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
it the the hinges are of course mounted

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.430 
it the the hinges are of course mounted
on<00:00:53.969> on<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.449> other<00:00:54.600> side<00:00:54.840> of<00:00:54.989> this<00:00:55.199> particular

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
on on the other side of this particular

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.639 
on on the other side of this particular
frame<00:00:56.280> which<00:00:56.730> stick<00:00:57.000> which<00:00:57.449> runs<00:00:57.719> which<00:00:58.230> turns

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
frame which stick which runs which turns

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.709 
frame which stick which runs which turns
into<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.980> hitch<00:00:59.430> in<00:00:59.579> itself<00:00:59.879> which<00:01:00.600> is

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
into the hitch in itself which is

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.119 
into the hitch in itself which is
adjustable<00:01:01.170> by<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.350> way<00:01:01.530> if<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.710> can<00:01:01.829> get<00:01:01.980> that

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
adjustable by the way if I can get that

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.359 
adjustable by the way if I can get that
on<00:01:02.280> there<00:01:02.989> and<00:01:04.670> what<00:01:05.670> this<00:01:05.820> now<00:01:06.060> does<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.630> that

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
on there and what this now does is that

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:14.390 
on there and what this now does is that
is<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.670> as<00:01:08.930> the<00:01:09.930> wheels<00:01:10.380> lift<00:01:10.890> up<00:01:11.420> here<00:01:13.400> this

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
is that as the wheels lift up here this

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.120 
is that as the wheels lift up here this
pulley<00:01:14.760> system<00:01:15.330> also<00:01:15.780> lifts<00:01:16.080> this<00:01:16.409> wheel<00:01:16.799> up

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
pulley system also lifts this wheel up

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.859 
pulley system also lifts this wheel up
here<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.729> now<00:01:17.790> this<00:01:17.939> pulley<00:01:18.180> system<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.689> made

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
here and now this pulley system is made

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.350 
here and now this pulley system is made
from<00:01:19.170> parts<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.770> bought<00:01:20.220> got<00:01:20.700> from<00:01:20.820> an<00:01:20.880> old<00:01:21.000> VCR

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
from parts I bought got from an old VCR

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.310 
from parts I bought got from an old VCR
and<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.200> wires<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.710> was<00:01:22.860> picture<00:01:23.130> wire<00:01:23.460> hanger

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
and the wires it was picture wire hanger

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.399 
and the wires it was picture wire hanger
yeah<00:01:26.130> then<00:01:26.850> I've<00:01:26.970> just<00:01:27.180> simply<00:01:27.509> taken<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.290> few

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
yeah then I've just simply taken a few

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.749 
yeah then I've just simply taken a few
filaments<00:01:28.829> out<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.130> make<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.820> make<00:01:30.000> them<00:01:30.180> more

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
filaments out to make to make them more

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.319 
filaments out to make to make them more
scale<00:01:32.759> correct<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.360> guess<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.780> way<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.380> put<00:01:34.619> it

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
scale correct I guess the way to put it

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:39.289 
scale correct I guess the way to put it
when<00:01:36.329> they<00:01:36.540> are<00:01:36.689> up<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.460> the<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.880> it's

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
when they are up and the the it's

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.350 
when they are up and the the it's
completely<00:01:39.479> raised<00:01:40.020> this<00:01:41.009> locking<00:01:41.520> bar<00:01:41.790> here

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
completely raised this locking bar here

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.050 
completely raised this locking bar here
I<00:01:42.869> put<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.500> pin<00:01:43.740> inside<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.369> keeps<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.759> up<00:01:44.909> now

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
I put a pin inside it keeps it up now

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.090 
I put a pin inside it keeps it up now
over<00:01:48.060> on<00:01:48.180> this<00:01:48.390> side<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.930> toy<00:01:49.229> in<00:01:49.530> here<00:01:49.920> you

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
over on this side of the toy in here you

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.219 
over on this side of the toy in here you
could<00:01:50.220> tell<00:01:50.430> it's<00:01:50.579> even<00:01:50.850> in<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.450> real<00:01:51.630> toy<00:01:51.899> its

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
could tell it's even in the real toy its

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.020 
could tell it's even in the real toy its
and<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:53.009> real<00:01:53.130> piece<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.610> equipment

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
and the real piece of equipment

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.789 
and the real piece of equipment
hopefully<00:01:54.240> get<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.390> good<00:01:54.450> focus<00:01:54.869> on<00:01:55.079> you<00:01:55.259> it's

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
hopefully get a good focus on you it's

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.620 
hopefully get a good focus on you it's
it's<00:01:56.100> actually<00:01:56.430> spring<00:01:56.700> loaded<00:01:56.939> on<00:01:57.210> this<00:01:57.390> what

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
it's actually spring loaded on this what

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.020 
it's actually spring loaded on this what
I<00:01:57.659> call<00:01:57.719> Tower<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.310> Tower<00:01:59.579> was<00:01:59.790> pretty

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
I call Tower and that Tower was pretty

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.030 
I call Tower and that Tower was pretty
complex<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.750> make<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.229> it's<00:02:01.710> spring-loaded

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
complex to make and it's spring-loaded

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.039 
complex to make and it's spring-loaded
and<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.610> moves<00:02:02.850> in<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.149> would<00:02:03.210> make<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:03.659> wing

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
and it moves in it would make that wing

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.039 
and it moves in it would make that wing
float<00:02:04.469> in<00:02:04.680> real<00:02:04.890> life<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.969> very<00:02:06.060> complicated

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
float in real life a very complicated

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.010 
float in real life a very complicated
