it's obvious zurk has the ability to

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.960 
it's obvious zurk has the ability to
make<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.960> lot<00:01:31.259> more<00:01:31.290> workers<00:01:31.890> than<00:01:32.040> any<00:01:32.640> other

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
make a lot more workers than any other

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.590 
make a lot more workers than any other
race<00:01:33.590> now<00:01:34.590> from<00:01:34.890> income<00:01:35.369> comes<00:01:36.150> army

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
race now from income comes army

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.840 
race now from income comes army
eventually<00:01:37.409> right<00:01:37.650> if<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:38.340> have<00:01:38.460> more<00:01:38.640> income

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
eventually right if you have more income

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.819 
eventually right if you have more income
you<00:01:39.240> will<00:01:39.270> eventually<00:01:39.720> be<00:01:40.200> able<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.650> get

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
you will eventually be able to get

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.010 
you will eventually be able to get
bigger<00:01:41.310> army<00:01:41.729> than<00:01:41.880> your<00:01:42.030> opponent<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.899> is

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
bigger army than your opponent that is

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
long as I just keep being aggressive I

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.260

know<00:01:51.720> that<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.259> eventually<00:01:53.009> we'll<00:01:53.640> be<00:01:53.670> able<00:01:54.000> to

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
know that I eventually we'll be able to

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.910 
know that I eventually we'll be able to
kill<00:01:54.479> him<00:01:54.659> just<00:01:54.930> because<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.439> will<00:01:55.740> have<00:01:55.890> a

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
kill him just because I will have a

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.490 
kill him just because I will have a
bigger<00:01:56.159> army<00:01:56.719> that<00:01:57.719> is<00:01:57.840> one<00:01:57.990> of<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.229> main

about when playing zerg is my economy

bigger than my opponent no I need to get
a<00:02:04.619> bigger<00:02:04.860> economy<00:02:05.310> up<00:02:05.430> because<00:02:05.700> I<00:02:05.729> will<00:02:06.090> be

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
a bigger economy up because I will be

a bigger economy up because I will be
able<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.540> eventually<00:02:07.439> over<00:02:08.099> on<00:02:08.250> him<00:02:08.539> now

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739

is kind of like a

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.150 
is kind of like a
sponge<00:02:13.720> you<00:02:14.110> know<00:02:14.200> you<00:02:14.260> can<00:02:14.470> actually<00:02:14.620> suck<00:02:15.010> up

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160

a<00:02:15.280> lot<00:02:15.310> of<00:02:15.489> attacks<00:02:15.879> and<00:02:16.060> then<00:02:16.239> eventually

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
a lot of attacks and then eventually

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.839

like burst out a lot of water I know it

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.160 
like burst out a lot of water I know it
sounds<00:02:19.000> kind<00:02:19.209> of<00:02:19.360> lame<00:02:19.510> like<00:02:19.750> that<00:02:19.780> but<00:02:20.050> it's

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
sounds kind of lame like that but it's

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.170 
sounds kind of lame like that but it's
actually<00:02:20.290> kind<00:02:20.709> of<00:02:20.800> through<00:02:21.010> because<00:02:21.280> the

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
and getting as big as an economy up

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.530 
and getting as big as an economy up
without<00:02:29.500> dying<00:02:30.010> pretty<00:02:30.430> much<00:02:30.640> now<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.209> time

and dumped us giving them a big
advantage<00:02:43.900> economy<00:02:44.440> wise<00:02:44.620> and<00:02:44.830> eventually

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
advantage economy wise and eventually

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.860 
advantage economy wise and eventually
get<00:02:45.849> them<00:02:46.000> a<00:02:46.030> bigger<00:02:46.269> army<00:02:47.610> now<00:02:48.690> there<00:02:49.690> are<00:02:49.810> a

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
get them a bigger army now there are a

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.199 
get them a bigger army now there are a
few<00:02:50.140> reasons<00:02:50.200> why<00:02:50.739> people<00:02:51.160> and<00:02:51.519> wiser<00:02:51.700> players

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209

what<00:03:13.989> you<00:03:14.110> can<00:03:14.290> do<00:03:14.440> that<00:03:14.590> in<00:03:14.799> that<00:03:14.920> case<00:03:15.130> is<00:03:15.370> go

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
what you can do that in that case is go

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:17.729 
what you can do that in that case is go
for<00:03:15.790> a<00:03:15.819> roach<00:03:16.030> bust<00:03:16.360> on<00:03:16.510> to<00:03:16.690> basehor<00:03:17.140> that<00:03:17.620> is

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
for a roach bust on to basehor that is

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.199 
for a roach bust on to basehor that is
one<00:03:17.889> of<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:18.040> reasons<00:03:18.489> why<00:03:18.579> you<00:03:18.639> see<00:03:18.880> a<00:03:18.910> lot<00:03:18.970> of

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
one of the reasons why you see a lot of

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.539 
one of the reasons why you see a lot of
aggressive<00:03:19.569> Zerg<00:03:19.900> players<00:03:20.200> for<00:03:21.040> example<00:03:21.459> in

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
aggressive Zerg players for example in

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.780 
aggressive Zerg players for example in
the<00:03:21.670> gsl<00:03:22.120> they<00:03:22.299> will<00:03:22.450> for<00:03:22.810> example<00:03:22.889> I<00:03:23.889> said<00:03:24.579> for

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
the gsl they will for example I said for

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.610 
the gsl they will for example I said for
example<00:03:24.819> all<00:03:25.299> of<00:03:25.420> this<00:03:25.569> video<00:03:25.870> but<00:03:26.079> better

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
example all of this video but better

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.590 
example all of this video but better
than<00:03:26.799> mine<00:03:26.920> keep<00:03:27.280> it<00:03:27.430> just<00:03:28.209> forget<00:03:28.389> about<00:03:28.450> it

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
than mine keep it just forget about it

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.509 
than mine keep it just forget about it
but<00:03:28.870> um<00:03:28.989> that's<00:03:29.769> one<00:03:29.920> of<00:03:30.010> the<00:03:30.130> reasons<00:03:30.430> why

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
but um that's one of the reasons why

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.069 
but um that's one of the reasons why
they<00:03:30.609> get<00:03:30.730> aggressive<00:03:31.090> right<00:03:31.239> they<00:03:31.780> know

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
they get aggressive right they know

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:34.110 
they get aggressive right they know
their<00:03:32.290> opponent<00:03:32.769> they<00:03:32.950> know<00:03:33.190> that<00:03:33.340> it<00:03:33.489> will<00:03:33.609> go

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
their opponent they know that it will go

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.300 
their opponent they know that it will go
for<00:03:34.359> a<00:03:34.389> certain<00:03:34.840> built<00:03:35.049> most<00:03:35.560> like<00:03:35.799> your<00:03:35.829> map

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
for a certain built most like your map

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.949 
for a certain built most like your map
so<00:03:36.459> might<00:03:36.760> not<00:03:36.910> give<00:03:37.209> it<00:03:37.329> a<00:03:37.420> try<00:03:37.450> because<00:03:37.720> you

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
so might not give it a try because you

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.140 
so might not give it a try because you
will<00:03:38.139> know<00:03:38.319> that<00:03:38.980> you<00:03:39.190> will<00:03:39.370> be<00:03:39.430> able<00:03:39.549> to<00:03:39.940> win

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150

early on now there is a phrase specific

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.780 
early on now there is a phrase specific
situation<00:03:43.780> in<00:03:43.959> we're<00:03:44.530> aggressive<00:03:45.310> play<00:03:45.519> will

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
situation in we're aggressive play will

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:45.759 
much as you possibly can as a zerg

player<00:04:45.789> up<00:04:46.419> until<00:04:46.810> a<00:04:46.870> point<00:04:47.139> if<00:04:47.349> you<00:04:47.469> basically

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
player up until a point if you basically

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:50.459 
player up until a point if you basically
are<00:04:48.039> maxed<00:04:48.520> out<00:04:48.639> in<00:04:48.849> berk<00:04:49.210> account<00:04:49.569> so<00:04:49.780> further

00:04:50.459 --> 00:04:50.469 
are maxed out in berk account so further

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:52.679 
are maxed out in berk account so further
player<00:04:50.919> that's<00:04:51.129> like<00:04:51.340> 70<00:04:51.789> to<00:04:51.939> 80<00:04:52.180> drones<00:04:52.569> that

player that's like 70 to 80 drones that
you<00:04:52.870> want<00:04:53.050> to<00:04:53.110> be<00:04:53.199> having<00:04:53.530> on<00:04:53.650> 34<00:04:54.129> bases<00:04:54.370> before

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
you want to be having on 34 bases before

you really want to start slamming out

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.909

units<00:04:57.250> and<00:04:57.400> that<00:04:57.849> is<00:04:57.969> one<00:04:58.120> of<00:04:58.150> the<00:04:58.270> big<00:04:58.539> reasons

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
units and that is one of the big reasons

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:03.059 
units and that is one of the big reasons
why<00:04:59.919> zerk<00:05:00.669> are<00:05:00.849> sitting<00:05:01.210> back<00:05:01.389> early<00:05:01.840> game<00:05:02.069> now

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:03.069 
why zerk are sitting back early game now

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:05.279 
why zerk are sitting back early game now
a<00:05:03.099> lot<00:05:03.400> of<00:05:03.430> players<00:05:03.789> are<00:05:04.150> actually<00:05:04.780> making<00:05:04.990> way

a lot of players are actually making way

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:07.230 
a lot of players are actually making way
too<00:05:05.319> many<00:05:05.590> units<00:05:05.979> early<00:05:06.250> on<00:05:06.280> as<00:05:06.580> a<00:05:06.879> third

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
too many units early on as a third

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.180 
too many units early on as a third
player<00:05:07.479> it's<00:05:07.780> all<00:05:07.900> about<00:05:08.409> making<00:05:08.740> as<00:05:08.949> many

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
player it's all about making as many

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.070 
player it's all about making as many
drones<00:05:09.610> as<00:05:09.879> you<00:05:09.969> possibly<00:05:10.360> can<00:05:10.569> in<00:05:10.750> the<00:05:10.840> early

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
drones as you possibly can in the early

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.779 
drones as you possibly can in the early
part<00:05:11.289> of<00:05:11.349> the<00:05:11.469> game<00:05:11.500> if<00:05:11.830> you<00:05:12.370> want<00:05:12.580> to<00:05:12.699> be

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:12.789 
part of the game if you want to be

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:14.369 
part of the game if you want to be
playing<00:05:12.940> defensively<00:05:13.569> and<00:05:13.870> which<00:05:14.349> you

00:05:14.369 --> 00:05:14.379 
playing defensively and which you

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:16.110 
playing defensively and which you
probably<00:05:14.860> should<00:05:15.280> be<00:05:15.370> doing<00:05:15.610> if<00:05:15.729> you<00:05:15.849> really

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
probably should be doing if you really

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.219 
probably should be doing if you really
want<00:05:16.270> to<00:05:16.389> move<00:05:16.960> up<00:05:17.139> the<00:05:17.169> leaks<00:05:17.500> now<00:05:19.080> what<00:05:20.080> you

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
sometimes happen like what will happen

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.670

if<00:05:22.300> you<00:05:22.449> start<00:05:22.690> making<00:05:22.870> a<00:05:23.050> lot<00:05:23.199> of<00:05:23.259> drums<00:05:23.529> is

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
if you start making a lot of drums is

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.230 
if you start making a lot of drums is
that<00:05:23.800> you<00:05:23.889> will<00:05:24.009> simply<00:05:24.340> die<00:05:24.550> too<00:05:24.610> like<00:05:25.000> four

aliens that run by you will not be able
to<00:05:26.889> defend<00:05:27.129> it<00:05:27.310> because<00:05:27.669> you<00:05:27.969> made<00:05:28.150> too<00:05:28.360> many

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 
to defend it because you made too many

to defend it because you made too many
drunks<00:05:28.870> that<00:05:29.050> is<00:05:29.169> a<00:05:29.199> good<00:05:29.560> loss<00:05:29.860> right<00:05:30.550> there

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900 
situation now the worst thing to do is

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.990 
situation now the worst thing to do is
to<00:05:49.960> make<00:05:50.560> like<00:05:50.770> a<00:05:50.800> few<00:05:51.129> units<00:05:51.400> every<00:05:51.669> now<00:05:51.819> and

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
to make like a few units every now and

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.430 
to make like a few units every now and
then<00:05:52.150> and<00:05:52.300> then<00:05:52.449> go<00:05:52.599> back<00:05:52.629> to<00:05:52.810> drowning<00:05:53.229> and

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
then and then go back to drowning and

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.839 
then and then go back to drowning and
let<00:05:53.529> make<00:05:53.650> a<00:05:53.680> few<00:05:53.889> units<00:05:54.190> again<00:05:54.490> and<00:05:54.639> then<00:05:54.729> go

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:54.849 
let make a few units again and then go

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:56.490 
let make a few units again and then go
back<00:05:54.879> to<00:05:55.029> drunk<00:05:55.330> that's<00:05:55.870> actually<00:05:56.020> not<00:05:56.289> what

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
back to drunk that's actually not what

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.230 
back to drunk that's actually not what
you<00:05:56.680> want<00:05:56.860> to<00:05:56.949> be<00:05:57.039> doing<00:05:57.250> because<00:05:57.580> if<00:05:57.879> you

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
you want to be doing because if you

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.610 
you want to be doing because if you
could<00:05:58.419> have<00:05:58.509> had<00:05:58.659> those<00:05:58.779> drones<00:05:59.110> up<00:05:59.319> a<00:05:59.409> minute

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
could have had those drones up a minute

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.800 
could have had those drones up a minute
earlier<00:06:00.159> they<00:06:00.639> would<00:06:00.849> have<00:06:00.969> been<00:06:01.120> a<00:06:01.300> lot<00:06:01.569> a<00:06:01.750> lot

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
earlier they would have been a lot a lot

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.360 
earlier they would have been a lot a lot
stronger<00:06:02.349> and<00:06:02.650> you<00:06:02.710> would<00:06:02.860> have<00:06:02.949> just<00:06:03.039> got<00:06:03.339> a

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370 
stronger and you would have just got a

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.879 
stronger and you would have just got a
lot<00:06:03.699> more<00:06:03.729> resources<00:06:04.419> from<00:06:04.569> those<00:06:04.779> drums<00:06:05.680> you

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:05.889 
lot more resources from those drums you

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:07.559 
lot more resources from those drums you
could<00:06:06.039> have<00:06:06.129> made<00:06:06.279> the<00:06:06.400> earlier<00:06:06.610> now<00:06:06.789> whatever

00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:07.569 
could have made the earlier now whatever
