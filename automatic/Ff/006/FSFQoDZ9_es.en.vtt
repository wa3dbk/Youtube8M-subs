it's<00:00:17.550> capable<00:00:17.970> of<00:00:18.320> based<00:00:19.320> on<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.650> data<00:00:19.830> it's

changed that much the laser should still

00:03:50.950 --> 00:04:00.550 
changed that much the laser should still
work<00:03:53.489> the<00:03:54.489> laser<00:03:54.700> seems<00:03:55.120> to<00:03:55.270> be<00:03:55.360> working
