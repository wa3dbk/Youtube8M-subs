each other and so it's not really
something<00:05:48.770> you<00:05:48.949> can<00:05:49.129> train<00:05:49.340> them<00:05:49.520> out<00:05:49.669> of

00:05:49.869 --> 00:05:49.879 
something you can train them out of

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:51.909 
something you can train them out of
right<00:05:50.330> you<00:05:50.780> can<00:05:50.990> you<00:05:51.199> can<00:05:51.349> work<00:05:51.560> with<00:05:51.590> them<00:05:51.860> and

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:51.919 
right you can you can work with them and

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:54.850 
right you can you can work with them and
have<00:05:52.550> them<00:05:52.969> kind<00:05:53.750> of<00:05:53.870> learned<00:05:54.139> respectful

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
have them kind of learned respectful

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.559 
have them kind of learned respectful
boundaries<00:05:55.400> so<00:05:55.699> that<00:05:55.729> you<00:05:55.939> can<00:05:56.120> work<00:05:56.539> with

00:05:56.559 --> 00:05:56.569 
boundaries so that you can work with
