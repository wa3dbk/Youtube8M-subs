00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
this is an email by blood sucked and bud

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.360 
this is an email by blood sucked and bud
wants<00:00:06.690> to<00:00:06.779> know<00:00:06.930> this<00:00:07.109> how<00:00:07.560> does<00:00:07.830> the<00:00:07.980> Northern

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
wants to know this how does the Northern

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.850 
wants to know this how does the Northern
Hemisphere's<00:00:09.000> high<00:00:09.660> proportion<00:00:10.410> of<00:00:10.500> land

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
Hemisphere's high proportion of land

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.540 
Hemisphere's high proportion of land
mass<00:00:11.599> affect<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.780> Earth's<00:00:13.250> rotation<00:00:16.250> yeah<00:00:17.250> so

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
mass affect the Earth's rotation yeah so

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.980 
mass affect the Earth's rotation yeah so
here<00:00:19.820> what's<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.910> fellas<00:00:21.150> name<00:00:21.240> this<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:21.750> Bud

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
here what's the fellas name this is Bud

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.429 
here what's the fellas name this is Bud
sunt<00:00:22.320> but<00:00:22.650> knows<00:00:22.980> that<00:00:23.730> most<00:00:23.939> of<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.330> land<00:00:25.140> of

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
sunt but knows that most of the land of

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.540 
sunt but knows that most of the land of
the<00:00:25.529> earth<00:00:25.680> is<00:00:25.949> in<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.160> northern<00:00:26.460> hemisphere

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
the earth is in the northern hemisphere

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.720 
the earth is in the northern hemisphere
it's<00:00:27.000> like<00:00:27.230> 80%<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.920> only<00:00:29.010> has<00:00:29.220> mail<00:00:29.519> in<00:00:29.670> the

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
it's like 80% of it only has mail in the

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.519 
it's like 80% of it only has mail in the
hemisphere<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.330> by<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.660> way<00:00:30.750> about<00:00:30.929> 80%<00:00:31.500> of

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
hemisphere and by the way about 80% of

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.950 
hemisphere and by the way about 80% of
the<00:00:31.619> population<00:00:31.969> the<00:00:32.969> human<00:00:33.360> population<00:00:33.899> is

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
the population the human population is

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.900 
the population the human population is
in<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.140> northern<00:00:34.440> hemisphere<00:00:34.530> as<00:00:35.070> well<00:00:35.550> right

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
in the northern hemisphere as well right

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:44.180 
in the northern hemisphere as well right
so<00:00:35.940> we<00:00:36.870> tend<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.170> live<00:00:37.410> where<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.950> land<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:43.190> on

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
so we tend to live where the land is on

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.979 
so we tend to live where the land is on
that<00:00:44.370> one<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:45.480> Earth<00:00:46.170> has<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> rotation<00:00:47.489> rate

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
that one so Earth has a rotation rate

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.340 
that one so Earth has a rotation rate
that<00:00:48.989> is<00:00:49.850> endowed<00:00:50.850> by<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.360> distribution<00:00:52.020> of

solid ball all right if you were to

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.799 
solid ball all right if you were to
change<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.920> distribution<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.609> matter<00:00:59.820> if<00:01:00.570> you

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
change the distribution of matter if you

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.389 
change the distribution of matter if you
were<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.079> move<00:01:01.320> continents<00:01:02.129> from<00:01:02.250> the

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
were to move continents from the

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.799 
were to move continents from the
northern<00:01:02.730> hemisphere<00:01:02.760> into<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.600> south

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
northern hemisphere into the south

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.929 
northern hemisphere into the south
towards<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.769> equator<00:01:04.979> away<00:01:05.580> from<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
towards the equator away from the

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.420 
towards the equator away from the
equator<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.510> will<00:01:07.290> change<00:01:07.650> what's<00:01:08.130> called

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
equator you will change what's called

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.179 
equator you will change what's called
the<00:01:08.970> moment<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.420> inertia<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.650> earth<00:01:10.799> the

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
the moment of inertia of the earth the

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.850 
the moment of inertia of the earth the
moment<00:01:11.729> of<00:01:11.909> inertia<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.840> physics<00:01:13.260> table<00:01:13.619> or

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
moment of inertia is a physics table or

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.440 
moment of inertia is a physics table or
if<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.159> change<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.880> moment<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.270> inertia

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
if you change the moment of inertia

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.140 
if you change the moment of inertia
earth<00:01:16.170> rotation<00:01:16.740> rate<00:01:16.950> will<00:01:17.490> change<00:01:17.790> with<00:01:18.000> it

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
earth rotation rate will change with it

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.890 
earth rotation rate will change with it
okay<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.080> by<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.830> way<00:01:19.920> skaters<00:01:20.670> do<00:01:20.880> this<00:01:21.090> when

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
okay and by the way skaters do this when

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.149 
okay and by the way skaters do this when
they<00:01:22.020> pull<00:01:22.229> their<00:01:22.380> arms<00:01:22.409> in<00:01:22.799> they<00:01:23.040> are

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
they pull their arms in they are

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.950 
they pull their arms in they are
changing<00:01:23.670> their<00:01:23.790> own<00:01:23.970> moment<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.450> inertia<00:01:24.720> and

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
changing their own moment of inertia and

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.390 
changing their own moment of inertia and
what<00:01:25.140> happens<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.560> rotation<00:01:25.979> rate<00:01:26.009> they

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
what happens to the rotation rate they

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.039 
what happens to the rotation rate they
go<00:01:26.549> fast<00:01:26.880> they<00:01:27.030> go<00:01:27.150> faster<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.750> by<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.930> way

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
go fast they go faster and by the way

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.200 
go fast they go faster and by the way
how<00:01:28.200> do<00:01:28.259> they<00:01:28.409> stop<00:01:28.710> they<00:01:29.460> put<00:01:29.670> their<00:01:29.790> arms<00:01:30.060> out

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
how do they stop they put their arms out

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.550 
how do they stop they put their arms out
back<00:01:30.450> out<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.869> they<00:01:30.930> can<00:01:31.079> stop<00:01:31.259> on<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.470> dime

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
back out and they can stop on a dime

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.710 
back out and they can stop on a dime
right<00:01:32.040> right<00:01:32.280> they<00:01:32.490> change<00:01:32.880> their<00:01:33.210> rotation

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
right right they change their rotation

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.289 
right right they change their rotation
rate<00:01:33.900> by<00:01:34.259> bringing<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.710> arms<00:01:35.400> in<00:01:35.579> or<00:01:35.820> out<00:01:36.000> if

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
rate by bringing the arms in or out if

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.359 
rate by bringing the arms in or out if
you<00:01:36.540> move<00:01:36.689> continents<00:01:37.320> towards<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.159> equator

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
you move continents towards the equator

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.399 
you move continents towards the equator
away<00:01:38.939> from<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.240> equator<00:01:39.509> into<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.110> southern

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
away from the equator into the southern

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.600 
away from the equator into the southern
hemisphere<00:01:40.799> towards<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.430> northern

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
hemisphere towards the northern

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.580 
hemisphere towards the northern
hemisphere<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.450> are<00:01:42.600> changing<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.320> moment

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
hemisphere you are changing the moment

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.649 
hemisphere you are changing the moment
of<00:01:43.649> inertia<00:01:43.860> our<00:01:44.579> rotation<00:01:45.149> rate<00:01:45.270> will<00:01:45.420> change

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
of inertia our rotation rate will change

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.240 
of inertia our rotation rate will change
it<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.869> can<00:01:46.020> calculate<00:01:46.259> how<00:01:46.619> much<00:01:46.680> we<00:01:46.979> change

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
it you can calculate how much we change

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.760 
it you can calculate how much we change
after<00:01:48.119> every<00:01:48.420> earthquake<00:01:48.619> because<00:01:49.619> an

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
after every earthquake because an

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.190 
after every earthquake because an
earthquake<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.579> redistribution<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.930> of

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
earthquake is a redistribution of the of

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.880 
earthquake is a redistribution of the of
the<00:01:52.590> continental<00:01:53.340> shelf<00:01:53.369> Wow<00:01:54.180> yeah<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.869> so<00:01:55.409> we

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
the continental shelf Wow yeah and so we

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.039 
the continental shelf Wow yeah and so we
would<00:01:56.070> actually<00:01:56.219> change<00:01:56.670> our<00:01:57.000> days<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.840> night

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
would actually change our days and night

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.539 
would actually change our days and night
Larry<00:01:58.380> today<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.829> can<00:01:59.040> make<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.250> longer<00:01:59.399> or

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
Larry today you can make it longer or

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.810 
Larry today you can make it longer or
shorter<00:01:59.899> anyone<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.020> moment<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.590> inertia

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
shorter anyone the moment of inertia

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.030 
shorter anyone the moment of inertia
exactly<00:02:02.850> in<00:02:03.000> fact<00:02:03.149> melting<00:02:03.810> glaciers<00:02:04.320> changes

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
exactly in fact melting glaciers changes

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.039 
exactly in fact melting glaciers changes
on<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.549> rotation<00:02:06.000> rate<00:02:06.149> of<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.299> earth<00:02:06.420> Wow

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
on the rotation rate of the earth Wow

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.440 
on the rotation rate of the earth Wow
yeah<00:02:07.469> because<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:08.099> have<00:02:08.280> mass<00:02:08.970> in<00:02:09.330> one

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
yeah because you have mass in one

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.330 
yeah because you have mass in one
location<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.170> then<00:02:10.289> melts<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:11.039> moves<00:02:11.220> to

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
location and then melts and moves to

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.750 
location and then melts and moves to
another<00:02:11.489> one

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
another one

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.809 
another one
Asian<00:02:12.030> on<00:02:12.150> earth<00:02:12.480> got<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:13.049> yeah<00:02:13.470> awesome

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
Asian on earth got to yeah awesome

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.149 
Asian on earth got to yeah awesome
wow<00:02:15.450> man<00:02:15.780> they<00:02:16.140> also<00:02:16.590> change<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.010> rotation

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
wow man they also change the rotation

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:19.610 
wow man they also change the rotation
rate<00:02:17.370> because<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:18.090> glaciers<00:02:18.329> are<00:02:18.900> on<00:02:19.349> land

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
rate because the glaciers are on land

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.429 
rate because the glaciers are on land
and<00:02:20.010> so<00:02:20.549> not<00:02:20.730> only<00:02:20.790> will<00:02:21.299> that<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:22.230> mass

00:02:22.429 --> 00:02:22.439 
and so not only will that the mass

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:25.490 
and so not only will that the mass
redistribute<00:02:23.340> it<00:02:24.000> also<00:02:24.209> moves<00:02:24.720> from<00:02:25.140> high

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
redistribute it also moves from high

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.030 
redistribute it also moves from high
altitude<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.579> sea<00:02:27.120> level<00:02:27.530> okay<00:02:28.530> so<00:02:28.590> now<00:02:28.860> you're

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
altitude to sea level okay so now you're

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.399 
altitude to sea level okay so now you're
changing<00:02:29.250> how<00:02:29.519> far<00:02:29.879> away<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.480> matter<00:02:30.720> is<00:02:30.959> from

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409 
changing how far away the matter is from

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:33.860 
changing how far away the matter is from
the<00:02:31.500> rotation<00:02:31.950> axis<00:02:32.280> of<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.519> earth<00:02:32.549> all<00:02:33.540> this

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
the rotation axis of the earth all this

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.559 
the rotation axis of the earth all this
conspires<00:02:34.799> to<00:02:34.980> influence<00:02:35.700> our<00:02:35.909> rotation<00:02:36.420> rate

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
conspires to influence our rotation rate

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.509 
conspires to influence our rotation rate
I<00:02:36.810> if<00:02:37.379> you<00:02:37.470> know<00:02:37.590> what<00:02:37.739> I'm<00:02:37.920> gonna<00:02:38.040> tell<00:02:38.280> you<00:02:38.370> I

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
I if you know what I'm gonna tell you I

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.759 
I if you know what I'm gonna tell you I
never<00:02:38.640> thought<00:02:39.209> you<00:02:39.420> would<00:02:39.629> give<00:02:40.140> that<00:02:40.170> much

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
never thought you would give that much

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.189 
never thought you would give that much
