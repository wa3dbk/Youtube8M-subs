00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:11.880
 the people are good and the people who speak admit 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.160
 make video guys but here to tv the 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.980
 problem and she comes back now you 'll see 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.980
 which has this hedge risk with the television 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:36.260
 for five 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:38.930
 I understand very fast and food 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.120
 beauty force 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:48.750
 some cars and just like that occurs 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:57.660
 question is only with the cover to them 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:01:07.650
 or save is that you make a 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:31.189
 faster than the 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:38.600
 which is the second 17 47 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:38.600
 Wednesday and Thursday 05 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:57.000
 if you are the difference they cause in 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.600
 final in a zero so English so 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.600
 conducive 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:11.800
 let's advance in the game I'm a light 89 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:19.380
 I 'm not much I did not play much 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:22.090
 game but I could go for a little jog 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:26.770
 so I 'll leave the controls 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:30.570
 traction and then the all connected not to cause 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.570
 problem that I 'm not a good driver 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.310
 You come here on the circuit of there sarthe 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:54.540
 choose a game that I'll even bother 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.540
 It just one is even 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:10.909
 now I wanted to pc you guys by 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:13.010
 150 subscribers is thank you very much 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:14.930
 It's true there, you help. 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.120
 I saw that the number of 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:21.500
 views increase a lot on the channel 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:24.230
 than a month two months ago and I just 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:30.560
 I have to thank you, Vilhena. 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:33.500
 so this is what happens, I'll leave you 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.799
 listening to his sound to you are in the 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.799
 salt 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:04:00.859
 and as long as the commission does not study it 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.859
 out of the year 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:08.310
 I do not run wedge with this line that 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:10.310
 connected to the executive because I prefer 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.599
 that took to avoid citing the children 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.599
 because I know how to brake and did not hit the 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:22.289
 car does not like to hit the car yet 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:24.509
 I study connected to automatic so much that I 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:27.990
 I will give a condition for you I will 

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:33.389
 do in the video do several times in 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:38.220
 change the power soon after won the making 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:40.830
 a setting the time will lose if 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.910
 makes a will have in rival mode 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:48.120
 You get in the top 10 we're there. 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:51.530
 I made a goal that the top 5 top 6 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:05:02.009
 now it has gone up a lot in mine because 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:05:07.020
 because I will never happen again in five 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:11.639
 of the seven with 49 is very fast 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:16.789
 it's very easy for you to do this up to 150 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:16.789
 years to be champion 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.760
 it is very difficult to control 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.550
 I think a detail is a very nice detail. 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:36.180
 of strength is the brake to warm up and stay 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:38.250
 This field is very cool. 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.610
 I know there is one detail at a minimum but it is 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.610
 very cool 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:56.150
 then there was this club and to show 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:58.460
