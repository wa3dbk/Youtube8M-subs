this video is intended to be a crash
course<00:00:08.809> on<00:00:09.110> how<00:00:09.350> to<00:00:09.380> waterproof<00:00:09.889> an<00:00:10.219> ESC<00:00:10.719> I've

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:11.719 
course on how to waterproof an ESC I've

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:14.080 
course on how to waterproof an ESC I've
learnt<00:00:12.110> the<00:00:12.230> hard<00:00:12.260> way<00:00:12.650> that<00:00:13.090> waterproofing

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:14.090 
learnt the hard way that waterproofing

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.390 
learnt the hard way that waterproofing
and<00:00:14.269> ESC<00:00:14.599> is<00:00:15.019> definitely<00:00:15.530> trial<00:00:15.890> and<00:00:16.160> error

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
and ESC is definitely trial and error

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:23.800 
and ESC is definitely trial and error
and<00:00:16.900> mostly<00:00:17.900> error<00:00:18.140> for<00:00:18.590> me<00:00:18.740> and<00:00:22.570> this<00:00:23.570> is<00:00:23.720> the

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
and mostly error for me and this is the

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.600 
and mostly error for me and this is the
third<00:00:24.020> one<00:00:24.230> of<00:00:24.259> these<00:00:24.470> that<00:00:24.650> have<00:00:24.800> had<00:00:25.009> bottom

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:25.610 
third one of these that have had bottom

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.940 
third one of these that have had bottom

bucks for 60 amp water-cooled sky wing
ESC<00:00:30.919> and<00:00:31.509> it's<00:00:32.509> like<00:00:32.689> I<00:00:32.720> said<00:00:32.899> this<00:00:32.989> is<00:00:33.110> the

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
ESC and it's like I said this is the

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.020 
ESC and it's like I said this is the
third<00:00:33.410> one<00:00:33.590> I've<00:00:33.770> had<00:00:33.980> as<00:00:34.280> they<00:00:34.489> burned<00:00:34.760> up

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
third one I've had as they burned up

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.260 
third one I've had as they burned up
I've<00:00:35.239> taken<00:00:35.480> them<00:00:35.660> apart<00:00:36.050> and<00:00:37.090> studied<00:00:38.090> them

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
I've taken them apart and studied them

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.660 
I've taken them apart and studied them
to<00:00:38.450> understand<00:00:38.900> why<00:00:39.080> they<00:00:39.320> burned<00:00:39.560> up<00:00:39.860> until<00:00:40.610> I

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
to understand why they burned up until I

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.160 
to understand why they burned up until I
got<00:00:40.820> to<00:00:40.940> the<00:00:41.060> third<00:00:41.240> one<00:00:41.420> in<00:00:41.510> each<00:00:41.630> one<00:00:41.870> I<00:00:41.900> made

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
got to the third one in each one I made

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.670 
got to the third one in each one I made
a<00:00:42.200> few<00:00:42.650> more<00:00:42.860> improvements<00:00:43.400> on<00:00:44.140> and<00:00:45.140> the<00:00:45.500> very

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
a few more improvements on and the very

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.990 
a few more improvements on and the very
first<00:00:45.890> one<00:00:46.040> that<00:00:46.400> burned<00:00:47.150> up<00:00:47.590> the<00:00:48.590> way<00:00:48.710> these

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
first one that burned up the way these

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.450 
first one that burned up the way these
where<00:00:50.000> these<00:00:50.180> are<00:00:50.300> put<00:00:50.510> together<00:00:51.460> water

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
where these are put together water

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.050 
where these are put together water
blocks<00:00:52.790> sit<00:00:53.690> on<00:00:53.810> top<00:00:54.020> of<00:00:54.080> a<00:00:54.260> silicone<00:00:54.680> pad<00:00:55.060> sit

blocks sit on top of a silicone pad sit
on<00:00:56.150> top<00:00:56.300> of<00:00:56.360> the<00:00:56.570> MOSFETs<00:00:57.170> like<00:00:58.010> that<00:00:58.340> and<00:00:58.579> that

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
on top of the MOSFETs like that and that

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:59.980 
on top of the MOSFETs like that and that
conducts<00:00:59.000> the<00:00:59.090> heat<00:00:59.180> away<00:00:59.420> that's<00:00:59.780> how<00:00:59.900> the

00:00:59.980 --> 00:00:59.990 
conducts the heat away that's how the

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.560 
conducts the heat away that's how the
heats<00:01:00.290> carried<00:01:00.650> out<00:01:00.910> through<00:01:01.910> a<00:01:01.940> heat

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570

transfer to the to the water block from
the<00:01:04.489> MOSFETs<00:01:04.970> and<00:01:05.170> all<00:01:06.170> this<00:01:06.490> structure<00:01:07.490> or

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
the MOSFETs and all this structure or

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.989 
the MOSFETs and all this structure or
this<00:01:07.970> assembly<00:01:08.479> is<00:01:08.859> inside<00:01:09.859> this<00:01:10.579> heat<00:01:10.789> shrink

00:01:10.989 --> 00:01:10.999 
this assembly is inside this heat shrink

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:14.859 
this assembly is inside this heat shrink
right<00:01:11.179> here<00:01:11.679> and<00:01:12.679> I<00:01:13.460> took<00:01:13.819> liquid<00:01:14.420> electrical

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
right here and I took liquid electrical

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:16.899 
right here and I took liquid electrical
tape<00:01:15.020> and<00:01:15.200> just<00:01:15.380> poured<00:01:16.100> it<00:01:16.249> in<00:01:16.460> the<00:01:16.490> ends<00:01:16.819> of

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
tape and just poured it in the ends of

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.330 
tape and just poured it in the ends of
the<00:01:16.969> heat<00:01:17.119> shrink<00:01:17.299> tubing<00:01:17.770> and<00:01:18.770> let<00:01:18.979> that<00:01:19.130> set

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
the heat shrink tubing and let that set

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.190 
the heat shrink tubing and let that set
up<00:01:19.399> and<00:01:19.609> I<00:01:19.640> thought<00:01:19.819> that'd<00:01:19.999> be<00:01:20.030> good<00:01:20.420> and<00:01:20.630> the

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
up and I thought that'd be good and the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.219 
up and I thought that'd be good and the
ESC<00:01:21.619> failed<00:01:21.859> within<00:01:22.069> minutes<00:01:22.369> and<00:01:22.990> when<00:01:23.990> I<00:01:24.049> cut

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
ESC failed within minutes and when I cut

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.219 
ESC failed within minutes and when I cut
it<00:01:24.350> apart<00:01:24.649> water<00:01:25.579> came<00:01:25.880> out<00:01:26.030> and<00:01:26.749> so<00:01:26.960> I<00:01:26.990> started

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
it apart water came out and so I started

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:28.629 
it apart water came out and so I started
wondering<00:01:27.380> how<00:01:27.649> could<00:01:27.829> water<00:01:28.069> get<00:01:28.310> in<00:01:28.429> there

00:01:28.629 --> 00:01:28.639 
wondering how could water get in there

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:31.629 
wondering how could water get in there
and<00:01:28.700> I<00:01:28.789> soon<00:01:29.030> realized<00:01:29.509> that<00:01:30.069> the<00:01:31.069> water<00:01:31.460> had

00:01:31.629 --> 00:01:31.639 
and I soon realized that the water had

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:33.550 
and I soon realized that the water had
actually<00:01:31.969> leaked<00:01:32.270> from<00:01:32.659> these<00:01:32.869> brass<00:01:33.139> nipples

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
actually leaked from these brass nipples

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.219 
actually leaked from these brass nipples
or<00:01:33.679> a<00:01:33.709> thread<00:01:34.039> into<00:01:34.310> the<00:01:34.369> aluminum<00:01:35.020> so<00:01:36.020> all

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
or a thread into the aluminum so all

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.199 
or a thread into the aluminum so all
that<00:01:36.409> water<00:01:36.619> leaked<00:01:37.009> out<00:01:37.249> of<00:01:37.459> that<00:01:37.609> fitting

00:01:38.199 --> 00:01:38.209 
that water leaked out of that fitting

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:40.569 
that water leaked out of that fitting
right<00:01:38.359> there<00:01:38.630> and<00:01:38.899> was<00:01:39.020> trapped<00:01:39.829> inside<00:01:40.100> the

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
right there and was trapped inside the

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:42.550 
right there and was trapped inside the
two<00:01:41.299> ends<00:01:41.479> that<00:01:41.630> were<00:01:41.749> sealed<00:01:41.959> that<00:01:42.170> water<00:01:42.409> was

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
two ends that were sealed that water was

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.090 
two ends that were sealed that water was
trapped<00:01:42.829> inside<00:01:43.270> shorten<00:01:44.270> itself<00:01:44.569> out<00:01:45.069> okay

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
trapped inside shorten itself out okay

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.080 
trapped inside shorten itself out okay
so<00:01:46.959> on<00:01:47.959> the<00:01:48.829> next<00:01:49.069> revision<00:01:49.369> of<00:01:49.670> that<00:01:49.729> same

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
so on the next revision of that same

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.039 
so on the next revision of that same
speed<00:01:50.420> controller

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
speed controller

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.459 
speed controller
I<00:01:52.389> cut<00:01:53.389> the<00:01:53.479> heat<00:01:53.630> shrink<00:01:53.779> off<00:01:54.049> and<00:01:54.259> I<00:01:54.289> did<00:01:54.439> a

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:54.469 
I cut the heat shrink off and I did a

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:57.160 
I cut the heat shrink off and I did a
very<00:01:54.829> liberal<00:01:55.219> coating<00:01:56.119> of<00:01:56.479> liquid

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
very liberal coating of liquid

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.469 
very liberal coating of liquid
electrical<00:01:57.590> tape<00:01:57.709> on<00:01:57.859> the<00:01:57.950> whole<00:01:58.069> thing<00:01:58.479> and

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
electrical tape on the whole thing and

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.510 
electrical tape on the whole thing and
things<00:01:59.719> were<00:01:59.869> going<00:02:00.020> good<00:02:00.319> with<00:02:00.469> it<00:02:00.649> until<00:02:00.859> I

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
things were going good with it until I

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.179 
things were going good with it until I
had<00:02:02.179> a<00:02:02.209> water<00:02:02.479> cooling<00:02:02.899> line<00:02:03.079> come<00:02:03.349> off<00:02:03.529> my

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
had a water cooling line come off my

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:06.699

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
too late but what had happened is this

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.650 
too late but what had happened is this
ESC<00:02:19.380> got<00:02:20.040> so<00:02:20.280> hot<00:02:20.490> with<00:02:20.700> no<00:02:20.850> water<00:02:21.060> going<00:02:21.270> to<00:02:21.540> it

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660

the liquid electrical tape got hot and

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.510 
the liquid electrical tape got hot and
allowed<00:02:34.950> a<00:02:34.980> leak

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
allowed a leak

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.340 
allowed a leak
well<00:02:35.670> once<00:02:35.910> again<00:02:36.030> water<00:02:36.360> got<00:02:36.600> to<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.840> MOSFETs

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
well once again water got to the MOSFETs

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
well once again water got to the MOSFETs
and<00:02:37.560> shored<00:02:38.070> them<00:02:38.310> out<00:02:38.460> and<00:02:38.730> stopped<00:02:39.300> working

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
and shored them out and stopped working

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.700 
and shored them out and stopped working
so<00:02:41.370> I've<00:02:41.640> kept<00:02:42.300> these<00:02:42.510> parts<00:02:42.930> from<00:02:43.230> each<00:02:43.380> one<00:02:43.650> I

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
the heat sink goes on to that's what

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.940 
the heat sink goes on to that's what
generates<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:44.430> heat<00:03:44.640> in<00:03:44.940> an<00:03:45.060> ESC<00:03:45.660> on<00:03:45.950> this

with<00:04:15.870> and<00:04:17.359> so<00:04:18.359> I<00:04:18.390> coded<00:04:18.870> everything<00:04:19.169> with<00:04:19.500> this

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
with and so I coded everything with this

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.300 
with and so I coded everything with this
epoxy<00:04:20.160> stuff<00:04:20.660> now<00:04:21.740> when<00:04:22.740> these<00:04:22.830> things<00:04:22.890> are

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
epoxy stuff now when these things are

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.790 
epoxy stuff now when these things are
made<00:04:23.780> they<00:04:24.780> don't<00:04:24.960> do<00:04:25.080> very<00:04:25.110> good<00:04:25.350> job<00:04:25.470> at

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
made they don't do very good job at

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.450 
made they don't do very good job at
getting<00:04:25.830> these<00:04:26.039> Maus

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
getting these Maus

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.029 
getting these Maus
that's<00:04:26.639> flat<00:04:27.090> across<00:04:27.360> the<00:04:27.479> top<00:04:27.770> that's<00:04:28.770> what

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
that's flat across the top that's what

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:32.840 
that's flat across the top that's what
they<00:04:29.160> use<00:04:29.400> this<00:04:30.270> silicone<00:04:30.810> pad<00:04:31.400> on<00:04:32.400> top<00:04:32.610> of<00:04:32.759> the

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
they use this silicone pad on top of the

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.809 
they use this silicone pad on top of the
Fett's<00:04:33.090> and<00:04:33.330> then<00:04:33.479> put<00:04:33.660> the<00:04:33.840> heatsink<00:04:34.289> on<00:04:34.819> top

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:35.819 
Fett's and then put the heatsink on top

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:37.550 
Fett's and then put the heatsink on top
of<00:04:35.970> that<00:04:36.090> trying<00:04:36.870> to<00:04:36.900> make<00:04:36.990> up<00:04:37.259> for<00:04:37.440> the

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
of that trying to make up for the

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.320 
of that trying to make up for the
inaccuracies<00:04:38.009> and<00:04:38.220> the<00:04:38.520> non<00:04:38.699> flatness<00:04:39.240> of

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
inaccuracies and the non flatness of

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.969 
inaccuracies and the non flatness of
these<00:04:39.479> FETs

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
these FETs

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:44.120 
these FETs
so<00:04:41.449> I'm<00:04:42.449> gonna<00:04:42.569> let<00:04:42.690> this<00:04:42.780> epoxy<00:04:43.139> dry<00:04:43.530> a<00:04:43.830> little

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
so I'm gonna let this epoxy dry a little

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.100 
so I'm gonna let this epoxy dry a little
longer<00:04:44.340> but<00:04:44.880> when<00:04:45.449> it's<00:04:45.599> all<00:04:45.690> said<00:04:45.720> and<00:04:46.050> done

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
longer but when it's all said and done

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.540 
longer but when it's all said and done
I'm<00:04:46.410> gonna<00:04:46.530> put<00:04:46.650> this<00:04:46.740> onto<00:04:46.949> a<00:04:47.039> sanding<00:04:47.520> block

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
I'm gonna put this onto a sanding block

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.390 
I'm gonna put this onto a sanding block
with<00:04:48.000> some<00:04:48.030> high<00:04:48.780> grit<00:04:49.080> sandpaper<00:04:49.470> I'm<00:04:50.220> gonna

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
with some high grit sandpaper I'm gonna

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.820 
with some high grit sandpaper I'm gonna
send<00:04:50.639> the<00:04:51.270> epoxy<00:04:51.780> off<00:04:51.930> the<00:04:52.139> tops<00:04:52.349> of<00:04:52.530> the<00:04:52.590> FETs

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
send the epoxy off the tops of the FETs

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.189 
send the epoxy off the tops of the FETs
and<00:04:53.039> actually<00:04:53.310> sand<00:04:53.639> into<00:04:54.509> the<00:04:54.539> FETs<00:04:54.900> a<00:04:54.990> little

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 
and actually sand into the FETs a little

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:56.740 
and actually sand into the FETs a little
bit<00:04:55.349> and<00:04:55.440> get<00:04:55.530> a<00:04:55.560> perfectly<00:04:56.039> flat<00:04:56.220> plane

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
bit and get a perfectly flat plane

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.260 
bit and get a perfectly flat plane
across<00:04:57.750> the<00:04:57.900> top<00:04:58.080> of<00:04:58.110> those<00:04:58.380> fats<00:04:58.710> and<00:04:59.270> I'm

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
across the top of those fats and I'm

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.700 
across the top of those fats and I'm
also<00:05:00.419> going<00:05:00.630> to<00:05:00.690> do<00:05:00.810> the<00:05:00.900> same<00:05:01.139> on<00:05:01.380> the<00:05:01.530> water

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
also going to do the same on the water

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.370 
also going to do the same on the water
block<00:05:02.009> and<00:05:02.910> like<00:05:03.060> I<00:05:03.120> said<00:05:03.330> make<00:05:03.630> sure<00:05:03.660> you<00:05:04.080> seal

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.820 
this is a permanent heat transfer paste
adhesion<00:05:49.620> so<00:05:50.400> yeah<00:05:51.150> once<00:05:51.479> I<00:05:51.599> get<00:05:51.719> the<00:05:52.289> FETs<00:05:52.530> and

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
adhesion so yeah once I get the FETs and

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.850 
adhesion so yeah once I get the FETs and
flat<00:05:53.340> and<00:05:53.610> the<00:05:54.030> block<00:05:54.300> is<00:05:54.570> flat<00:05:54.870> we're<00:05:55.650> going

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
flat and the block is flat we're going

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.279 
flat and the block is flat we're going
to<00:05:55.979> permanently<00:05:56.520> attach<00:05:56.719> the<00:05:57.719> heat<00:05:57.840> sink<00:05:58.169> to

00:05:58.279 --> 00:05:58.289 
to permanently attach the heat sink to

00:05:58.289 --> 00:05:59.240 
to permanently attach the heat sink to
the<00:05:58.409> top<00:05:58.590> of<00:05:58.740> the<00:05:58.830> FETs

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250 
the top of the FETs

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.730 
the top of the FETs
with<00:05:59.849> the<00:05:59.969> Arctic<00:06:00.240> silver<00:06:00.630> now<00:06:01.409> I'm<00:06:01.500> hoping

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
with the Arctic silver now I'm hoping

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.600 
with the Arctic silver now I'm hoping
this<00:06:02.099> will<00:06:02.219> be<00:06:02.280> the<00:06:02.849> end-all-be-all

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.610 
this will be the end-all-be-all

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.930 
this will be the end-all-be-all
waterproofing<00:06:05.610> solution<00:06:06.389> for<00:06:06.539> an<00:06:06.630> ESC<00:06:06.960> I<00:06:07.940> got

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 
waterproofing solution for an ESC I got

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.370 
waterproofing solution for an ESC I got
my<00:06:09.030> fingers<00:06:09.330> crossed<00:06:09.539> the<00:06:09.870> coating<00:06:10.199> looks

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 
my fingers crossed the coating looks

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:16.060 
my fingers crossed the coating looks
really<00:06:10.830> good<00:06:12.229> I'm<00:06:13.229> really<00:06:13.289> happy<00:06:13.800> with<00:06:14.070> it

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:16.070 
really good I'm really happy with it

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:20.060 
really good I'm really happy with it
so<00:06:17.070> is<00:06:17.940> what<00:06:18.210> we've<00:06:18.360> done<00:06:18.389> so<00:06:18.750> far<00:06:18.780> I<00:06:19.349> showed

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.070 
so is what we've done so far I showed

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.529 
so is what we've done so far I showed
you<00:06:20.190> the<00:06:20.280> two<00:06:20.430> products<00:06:20.849> that<00:06:20.880> we<00:06:21.060> use<00:06:21.300> to

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:21.539 
you the two products that we use to

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:23.270 
you the two products that we use to
hopefully<00:06:21.900> be<00:06:22.110> the<00:06:22.349> ultimate<00:06:22.500> solution<00:06:22.919> to

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 
hopefully be the ultimate solution to

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.360 
hopefully be the ultimate solution to
waterproof<00:06:23.729> your<00:06:23.880> es<00:06:24.180> es<00:06:24.560> so<00:06:25.560> I'll<00:06:25.919> be<00:06:26.099> doing<00:06:26.340> a

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
waterproof your es es so I'll be doing a

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:27.920 
waterproof your es es so I'll be doing a
follow<00:06:26.580> up<00:06:26.699> video<00:06:26.969> on<00:06:27.330> this<00:06:27.509> at<00:06:27.690> some<00:06:27.900> point

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:27.930 
follow up video on this at some point

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.830 
follow up video on this at some point
showing<00:06:28.860> the<00:06:29.039> finished<00:06:29.370> product<00:06:29.849> and<00:06:30.090> then

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 
showing the finished product and then

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.839 
showing the finished product and then
showing<00:06:31.530> a<00:06:31.710> video<00:06:32.130> of<00:06:32.280> it<00:06:32.400> in<00:06:32.550> the<00:06:32.669> boat

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:32.849 
showing a video of it in the boat

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:35.930 
showing a video of it in the boat
running<00:06:33.180> and<00:06:34.099> we'll<00:06:35.099> also<00:06:35.250> see<00:06:35.580> how<00:06:35.699> it<00:06:35.760> holds

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:35.940 
running and we'll also see how it holds

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.850 
running and we'll also see how it holds
up<00:06:36.210> over<00:06:36.330> a<00:06:36.539> period<00:06:36.719> of<00:06:36.870> time<00:06:37.080> out<00:06:37.589> on<00:06:37.650> the

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860 
up over a period of time out on the

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.479 
up over a period of time out on the
water<00:06:38.029> thanks<00:06:39.029> for<00:06:39.150> watching
