be crazy we can't do it and we've done

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.289 
be crazy we can't do it and we've done
it<00:04:14.020> well<00:04:14.890> you<00:04:14.980> know<00:04:15.100> Hong<00:04:15.550> Kong<00:04:15.730> dog<00:04:15.880> rescues

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
it well you know Hong Kong dog rescues

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.440 
it well you know Hong Kong dog rescues
it's<00:04:17.109> because<00:04:17.769> it's<00:04:17.920> run<00:04:18.130> by<00:04:18.280> volunteers<00:04:18.450> it's

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
it's because it's run by volunteers it's

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.539 
it's because it's run by volunteers it's
a<00:04:19.570> community<00:04:20.019> project<00:04:20.230> and<00:04:21.070> I<00:04:21.160> think<00:04:21.370> that's

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
a community project and I think that's

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.150 
a community project and I think that's
why<00:04:21.820> people<00:04:22.470> cared<00:04:23.470> about<00:04:23.680> what<00:04:24.010> was

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
why people cared about what was

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.490 
why people cared about what was
happening<00:04:24.210> because<00:04:25.210> it's<00:04:25.960> not<00:04:26.170> the<00:04:26.320> business

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
happening because it's not the business

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.410 
happening because it's not the business
