00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
you to practice that now so you are

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.710 
you to practice that now so you are
familiar<00:01:40.890> with<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.369> process<00:01:41.579> when<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.119> ask<00:01:42.450> you

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
familiar with the process when I ask you

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.660 
familiar with the process when I ask you
to<00:01:42.750> pause<00:01:43.079> me<00:01:43.380> as<00:01:43.560> we<00:01:44.040> go<00:01:44.220> through<00:01:44.490> these

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
to pause me as we go through these

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.980 
to pause me as we go through these
lessons<00:01:46.460> so<00:01:47.460> have<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:47.970> look<00:01:48.180> at<00:01:48.479> these<00:01:48.630> short
