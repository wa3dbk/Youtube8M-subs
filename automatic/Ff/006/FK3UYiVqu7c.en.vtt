also switch it to auto of here here you

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.819 
also switch it to auto of here here you
have<00:01:38.220> exposure<00:01:38.729> us<00:01:39.570> use<00:01:39.780> this<00:01:39.869> little<00:01:40.110> nozzle

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.160 
have exposure us use this little nozzle
here<00:01:41.549> or<00:01:42.000> not<00:01:42.240> nozzle<00:01:42.750> this<00:01:42.899> little

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
call it but you could use this thing

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.700 
call it but you could use this thing
right<00:01:47.040> here<00:01:47.070> on<00:01:47.430> till<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.689> know<00:01:48.869> it's<00:01:49.409> like

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
right here on till you know it's like

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.260 
right here on till you know it's like
the<00:01:49.920> settings<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.430> whatnot<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:50.939> this<00:01:51.060> works

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
the settings and whatnot and this works

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.730 
the settings and whatnot and this works
for<00:01:51.420> everything<00:01:51.509> so<00:01:52.290> if<00:01:52.350> i<00:01:52.439> want<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.649> change

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
for everything so if i want to change

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.520 
for everything so if i want to change
the<00:01:53.009> shutter<00:01:53.189> speed<00:01:53.990> here<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.110> get<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.259> fat

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
the shutter speed here you get a fat

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.100 
the shutter speed here you get a fat
slower<00:01:56.130> shutter<00:01:56.399> speed<00:01:56.759> you're<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.540> faster

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
slower shutter speed you're a faster

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.580 
slower shutter speed you're a faster
shutter<00:01:58.290> speed<00:01:58.759> and<00:01:59.759> whatnot<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.469> you<00:02:01.469> can

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
shutter speed and whatnot and you can

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.950 
shutter speed and whatnot and you can
change<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.890> ISO<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.369> whatnot<00:02:02.909> it's<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.810> think

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
change the ISO and whatnot it's I think

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.240 
change the ISO and whatnot it's I think
it's<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.469> think<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:04.740> is<00:02:04.890> really<00:02:05.070> cool

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
it's I think this is really cool

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.730 
it's I think this is really cool
especially<00:02:05.460> especially<00:02:06.030> for<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.570> on<00:02:06.899> you

photographers out there don't want to

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.490 
photographers out there don't want to

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
photography up another step here this is

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.500 
photography up another step here this is
this<00:02:20.340> is<00:02:20.460> my<00:02:20.550> favorite<00:02:20.910> thing<00:02:21.030> about<00:02:21.060> this<00:02:21.300> app

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
this is my favorite thing about this app

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.700 
this is my favorite thing about this app
this<00:02:21.690> focus<00:02:22.310> so<00:02:23.310> it's<00:02:23.460> manual<00:02:23.880> focus<00:02:24.270> here<00:02:24.480> and

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
this focus so it's manual focus here and

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.000 
this focus so it's manual focus here and
as<00:02:25.710> the<00:02:26.400> lowest<00:02:26.790> its<00:02:27.240> macro<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:28.020> then<00:02:28.230> your

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
as the lowest its macro and then your

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.820 
as the lowest its macro and then your
focus<00:02:29.460> to<00:02:29.640> infinity<00:02:29.880> I<00:02:30.450> think<00:02:31.440> that's<00:02:31.560> really

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
focus to infinity I think that's really

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.650 
focus to infinity I think that's really
cool<00:02:32.040> i<00:02:32.070> think<00:02:32.640> i<00:02:32.700> just<00:02:32.730> took<00:02:33.000> a<00:02:33.060> photo<00:02:33.390> there

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
cool i think i just took a photo there

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.990 
cool i think i just took a photo there
but<00:02:34.230> um<00:02:34.380> here's<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.220> white<00:02:35.550> balance<00:02:35.760> you

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
but um here's the white balance you

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.100 
but um here's the white balance you
could<00:02:36.180> also<00:02:36.330> change<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.780> white<00:02:37.080> balance

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
could also change the white balance

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.290 
could also change the white balance
around<00:02:37.709> which<00:02:38.310> is<00:02:38.520> also<00:02:39.170> handy<00:02:40.170> dandy<00:02:40.410> um<00:02:41.300> that

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
around which is also handy dandy um that

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.240 
around which is also handy dandy um that
was<00:02:42.420> really<00:02:42.630> weird<00:02:42.750> but<00:02:42.990> and<00:02:43.260> then<00:02:44.010> you<00:02:44.130> can

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250

well especially with the new mobile
lightroom<00:02:54.420> on<00:02:54.600> android<00:02:55.020> because<00:02:55.860> you<00:02:56.100> can<00:02:56.250> on

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
lightroom on android because you can on

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.270 
lightroom on android because you can on
switch<00:02:57.120> it<00:02:57.270> from<00:02:57.330> jpg<00:02:57.780> and<00:02:57.930> then<00:02:58.050> the<00:02:58.170> jpeg<00:02:58.560> raw

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
switch it from jpg and then the jpeg raw

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.880 
switch it from jpg and then the jpeg raw
and<00:02:59.700> you<00:03:00.180> if<00:03:00.750> you<00:03:00.840> know<00:03:00.989> like<00:03:01.230> if<00:03:01.440> you<00:03:01.590> use

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
and you if you know like if you use

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.790 
and you if you know like if you use
lightroom<00:03:02.459> then<00:03:02.700> you<00:03:03.270> would<00:03:03.420> know<00:03:03.600> that<00:03:03.800> raw

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
lightroom then you would know that raw

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.760 
lightroom then you would know that raw
is<00:03:05.160> very<00:03:05.550> useful<00:03:06.060> to<00:03:06.209> have<00:03:06.360> sometimes<00:03:06.930> because

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
is very useful to have sometimes because

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.949 
is very useful to have sometimes because

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
yeah as you can see from these sample

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.449 
yeah as you can see from these sample
pictures<00:03:21.930> on<00:03:22.230> this<00:03:22.590> really<00:03:22.980> is<00:03:23.100> a<00:03:23.130> huge

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
pictures on this really is a huge
