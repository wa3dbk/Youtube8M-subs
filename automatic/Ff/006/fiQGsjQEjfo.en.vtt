00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
corner and undies on the two side so

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.790 
corner and undies on the two side so
you'll<00:03:06.540> have<00:03:06.720> something<00:03:06.780> that<00:03:07.380> looks<00:03:07.410> like

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
will do that with all set all four sides

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.720 
will do that with all set all four sides
until<00:03:43.380> you<00:03:43.980> get<00:03:44.250> a<00:03:44.580> basket<00:03:45.450> like<00:03:46.050> this<00:03:46.730> but
