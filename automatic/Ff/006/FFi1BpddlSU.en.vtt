today we are sitting in the driveway and

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.120 
today we are sitting in the driveway and
putting<00:00:17.910> together<00:00:19.400> power<00:00:20.400> con<00:00:20.820> cables<00:00:22.130> so

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
putting together power con cables so

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.910 
putting together power con cables so
we're<00:00:23.550> just<00:00:23.730> going<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:23.910> do<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.529> quick<00:00:25.529> video<00:00:25.830> to

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
we're just going to do a quick video to

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.310 
we're just going to do a quick video to
show<00:00:26.100> you<00:00:26.340> what<00:00:26.700> we<00:00:26.849> do<00:00:27.090> in<00:00:27.419> how<00:00:27.779> we<00:00:27.840> prep<00:00:28.290> the

SJ cable prepped here and your I've done

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.140 
SJ cable prepped here and your I've done
is<00:00:55.050> we've<00:00:55.290> prepped<00:00:55.770> back<00:00:56.100> about<00:00:56.730> an<00:00:56.910> inch

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.150 
is we've prepped back about an inch

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.530 
is we've prepped back about an inch
maybe<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.570> little<00:00:58.050> bit<00:00:58.200> more<00:00:58.470> on<00:00:58.770> this<00:00:59.640> and<00:01:00.030> then

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
maybe a little bit more on this and then

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.950 
maybe a little bit more on this and then
we're<00:01:00.690> going<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.900> remove<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.640> paper<00:01:02.640> wrap<00:01:03.030> so

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
we're going to remove the paper wrap so

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.460 
we're going to remove the paper wrap so
now<00:01:04.110> we've<00:01:04.350> got<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.739> paper<00:01:04.920> wrap<00:01:05.339> removed<00:01:05.880> and

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
now we've got the paper wrap removed and

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.990 
now we've got the paper wrap removed and
we're<00:01:07.470> going<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.650> go<00:01:07.770> ahead<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.369> strip<00:01:08.700> back

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
we're going to go ahead and strip back

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.800 
we're going to go ahead and strip back
on<00:01:09.360> each<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.780> those<00:01:09.869> conductors<00:01:10.610> about<00:01:11.630> 1/4<00:01:12.630> of

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
on each of those conductors about 1/4 of

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.870 
on each of those conductors about 1/4 of
an<00:01:12.930> inch<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.229> put<00:01:13.560> into<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.189> power<00:01:14.550> con

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
an inch to put into the power con

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.090 
an inch to put into the power con
connector<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:16.080> selected<00:01:16.650> tool<00:01:16.830> of

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
connector and the selected tool of

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.710 
connector and the selected tool of
choice<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.850> these<00:01:18.120> strippers

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
choice is these strippers

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.050 
choice is these strippers
these<00:01:19.680> are<00:01:20.010> Klein<00:01:20.610> tools<00:01:21.170> and<00:01:22.640> we<00:01:23.640> typically

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
these are Klein tools and we typically

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.390 
these are Klein tools and we typically
use<00:01:24.180> for<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.110> 14<00:01:25.500> gauge<00:01:25.740> wire<00:01:25.770> we're<00:01:26.190> using

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
use for the 14 gauge wire we're using

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.980 
use for the 14 gauge wire we're using
we're<00:01:27.300> using<00:01:27.510> the<00:01:27.870> 12<00:01:28.320> gauge<00:01:29.450> stripping<00:01:30.450> and

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
we're using the 12 gauge stripping and

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.990 
we're using the 12 gauge stripping and
doesn't<00:01:31.830> even<00:01:31.890> touch<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.340> wires<00:01:32.580> in<00:01:32.880> the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
doesn't even touch the wires in the

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.180 
doesn't even touch the wires in the
jacket<00:01:33.450> on<00:01:33.600> this<00:01:33.830> insulation<00:01:34.830> of<00:01:35.070> the

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
jacket on this insulation of the

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.450

individual<00:01:35.760> conductors<00:01:36.240> comes<00:01:36.570> off<00:01:36.780> pretty

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
individual conductors comes off pretty

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.250 
individual conductors comes off pretty
smooth<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.880> what<00:01:39.450> we've<00:01:39.600> done<00:01:39.810> now<00:01:39.870> is<00:01:40.110> we've

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
smooth and what we've done now is we've

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.230 
smooth and what we've done now is we've
got<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.740> stripped<00:01:41.130> back<00:01:41.400> we've<00:01:41.700> twist<00:01:42.060> them

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
got that stripped back we've twist them

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.940 
got that stripped back we've twist them
in<00:01:42.330> them<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.600> little<00:01:42.780> bit<00:01:43.080> so<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.409> they<00:01:43.680> fit

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
in them a little bit so that they fit

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.510 
in them a little bit so that they fit
better<00:01:44.250> into<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:45.710> entrance<00:01:46.710> on<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.010> power

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
better into the entrance on the power

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.860 
better into the entrance on the power
con<00:01:47.909> connector<00:01:48.420> on<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.570> back<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:49.080> it<00:01:49.200> and

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
a screw on it and then there's the

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.410 
a screw on it and then there's the
little<00:02:03.800> insert<00:02:04.250> on<00:02:04.430> the<00:02:04.460> back<00:02:04.700> of<00:02:04.910> it<00:02:05.030> that<00:02:05.060> we

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
little insert on the back of it that we

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.440 
little insert on the back of it that we
tighten<00:02:05.810> down<00:02:05.840> and<00:02:06.490> that<00:02:07.490> is<00:02:07.820> what<00:02:08.210> the

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
tighten down and that is what the

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.070 
tighten down and that is what the
individual<00:02:09.380> conductors<00:02:09.920> go<00:02:10.190> into<00:02:10.550> there<00:02:10.790> is<00:02:10.970> a

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
individual conductors go into there is a

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.530 
individual conductors go into there is a
load<00:02:12.080> side<00:02:12.470> a<00:02:12.500> neutral<00:02:13.310> and<00:02:13.580> a<00:02:13.670> ground<00:02:14.000> on<00:02:14.360> each

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
load side a neutral and a ground on each

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.660 
load side a neutral and a ground on each
of<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:14.720> power<00:02:14.900> pods<00:02:15.260> and<00:02:15.710> so<00:02:16.400> we're<00:02:16.520> going<00:02:16.610> to

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
of the power pods and so we're going to

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.020 
of the power pods and so we're going to
go<00:02:16.820> ahead<00:02:16.910> and<00:02:17.590> get<00:02:18.590> going<00:02:18.890> first<00:02:19.220> one<00:02:19.550> we've

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
go ahead and get going first one we've

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.900 
go ahead and get going first one we've
got<00:02:20.270> in<00:02:20.510> here<00:02:20.540> and<00:02:21.080> it<00:02:21.590> is<00:02:21.860> tightened<00:02:22.400> down<00:02:22.460> and

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
got in here and it is tightened down and

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.380 
got in here and it is tightened down and
then<00:02:23.780> we'll<00:02:23.990> go<00:02:24.140> ahead<00:02:24.260> and<00:02:24.920> put<00:02:25.910> in<00:02:26.120> the

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
then we'll go ahead and put in the

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.230 
then we'll go ahead and put in the
ground<00:02:26.840> and<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.500> neutral<00:02:27.950> and<00:02:28.160> show<00:02:28.190> you<00:02:29.090> what

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
ground and the neutral and show you what

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.460 
ground and the neutral and show you what
that<00:02:29.270> looks<00:02:29.570> like<00:02:29.630> you<00:02:29.840> can<00:02:29.870> see<00:02:30.200> that<00:02:30.350> we've

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
that looks like you can see that we've

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.770 
that looks like you can see that we've
got<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:30.770> black<00:02:31.010> going<00:02:31.310> into<00:02:31.850> the<00:02:32.060> El<00:02:32.270> which<00:02:32.570> is

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
got the black going into the El which is

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.640 
got the black going into the El which is
the<00:02:32.960> load<00:02:33.230> and<00:02:34.750> very<00:02:35.750> easy<00:02:36.020> very<00:02:36.170> simple

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
the load and very easy very simple

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.300 
the load and very easy very simple
directions<00:02:37.280> to<00:02:37.610> follow<00:02:38.110> on<00:02:39.110> these<00:02:39.500> connectors

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
directions to follow on these connectors

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.550 
directions to follow on these connectors
so<00:02:40.940> now<00:02:41.090> you<00:02:41.150> can<00:02:41.360> see<00:02:41.540> we've<00:02:41.750> got<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:42.200> white

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
so now you can see we've got the white

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.610 
so now you can see we've got the white
to<00:02:42.800> neutral<00:02:43.250> in<00:02:43.490> seated<00:02:44.000> correctly<00:02:44.210> and<00:02:44.750> now

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
to neutral in seated correctly and now

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.800 
to neutral in seated correctly and now
just<00:02:45.920> have<00:02:46.160> the<00:02:46.430> ground<00:02:46.820> left<00:02:47.240> to<00:02:47.390> go

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
just have the ground left to go

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.660 
just have the ground left to go
and<00:02:48.580> we'll<00:02:49.580> have<00:02:49.790> this<00:02:50.030> end<00:02:50.420> compared<00:02:51.670> so

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
and we'll have this end compared so

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.750 
and we'll have this end compared so
there<00:02:52.820> we<00:02:52.970> have<00:02:53.150> all<00:02:53.390> of<00:02:53.540> the<00:02:53.630> wires<00:02:53.870> in<00:02:54.260> and

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
there we have all of the wires in and

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.490 
there we have all of the wires in and
type<00:02:55.760> down<00:02:56.150> on<00:02:56.570> the<00:02:56.720> connector<00:02:57.200> and<00:02:58.930> as<00:02:59.930> you

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
type down on the connector and as you

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.110 
type down on the connector and as you
can<00:03:00.620> see<00:03:00.860> if<00:03:01.040> you<00:03:01.130> look<00:03:01.190> real<00:03:01.640> close<00:03:01.910> you<00:03:01.940> can

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
can see if you look real close you can

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.270 
can see if you look real close you can
see<00:03:02.239> the<00:03:02.360> little<00:03:02.570> earth<00:03:03.170> ground<00:03:03.500> mark<00:03:03.920> where

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
see the little earth ground mark where

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.760 
see the little earth ground mark where
the<00:03:04.310> green<00:03:04.640> wire<00:03:04.850> just<00:03:05.209> went<00:03:05.450> in<00:03:05.600> so<00:03:06.410> very

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
the green wire just went in so very

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.320 
the green wire just went in so very
simple<00:03:07.340> easy<00:03:07.670> to<00:03:08.150> follow<00:03:10.030> symbols<00:03:11.030> and

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
simple easy to follow symbols and

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:12.729 
simple easy to follow symbols and
letters<00:03:11.450> and<00:03:11.780> everything<00:03:11.870> on<00:03:12.200> the<00:03:12.320> connectors

letters and everything on the connectors

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.350 
letters and everything on the connectors
the<00:03:12.980> other<00:03:13.130> end<00:03:13.400> is<00:03:13.580> the<00:03:13.730> same<00:03:14.170> just<00:03:15.170> different

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
the other end is the same just different

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.140 
the other end is the same just different
color<00:03:17.360> for<00:03:18.320> the<00:03:18.470> ins<00:03:18.650> and<00:03:18.800> outs<00:03:19.010> and<00:03:19.910> we're

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
color for the ins and outs and we're

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.310

and get it button in the front shell

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.920 
and get it button in the front shell
goes<00:03:25.310> on<00:03:25.580> this<00:03:25.850> and<00:03:26.150> just<00:03:26.420> slides<00:03:26.720> right

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
goes on this and just slides right

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.650 
goes on this and just slides right
through<00:03:27.530> and<00:03:27.860> then<00:03:28.000> pokes<00:03:29.000> out<00:03:29.180> the<00:03:29.390> front
