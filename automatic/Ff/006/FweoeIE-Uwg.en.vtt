00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:02.500
 Okay, guys! 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.320
 Today I will introduce you some products ... 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.120
 but I can and ... 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.380
 the tool for me to catch these eel fish 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.140
 Here, you can see 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.280
 This is 3 eels ... 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:17.500
 I can ... 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.860
 the biggest one is about 2 1/2 hours 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:20.400
 Here! 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.420
 It's about ... 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.300
 Ãšiii !!!! 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.740
 ... with the big toe 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.120
 Here! 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.800
 Here! About the big toe! ^^ 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.800
 And the other 2 are a little smaller 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.900
 then this is ... all are copper eels 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.500
 no problem! 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.880
 And here are 2 snakehead fish! 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.180
 These 2 snakehead fish ... 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.720
 Only a small one 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.420
 because this season it hasn't got big yet 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.320
 Very aggressive !!! 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.020
 Here are some ... 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.240
 the tool I used to sentence it 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.800
 Here, there's a set of eel hooks 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.760
 Here! 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.220
 Eel hook it has a clump of sentences including ... 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.800
 3-4 types of this! 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.520
 So this type is the most sensitive! 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.020
 and catch the biggest eels 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.420
 Here! 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.860
 This is my tongue homemade 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:20.900
 There! 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.240
 Very simple look! 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.340
 it's just a good steel fiber ... 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.780
 steel springs 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.480
 There are 2 heads ... 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.640
 This type is a big eel on ... 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.700
 3 slices 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.640
 This type is a small eel under 3 slices 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.520
 There... 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.860
 Its 2 heads are not much different 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.880
 Here, some hooks are available 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.660
 Buy in the market, but it is not very effective 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.320
 So I did not introduce 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.220
 And this is the ... 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.300
 This fish snake, this ... 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.280
 This is for this child 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.620
 Totally well! 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.640
 It is about to die to the place but ... to throw! 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.540
 This is snakehead fishing! 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.200
 then i ... 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.860
 in the old days it was connected to the coil 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.200
 Roll here! 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.760
 This roll is the cast fishing reel 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.080
 when fishing is hard ... some of you use the fishing rod 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.760
 But in my countryside, using this is the most effective 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.700
 Because when the fish eats ... 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.560
 is to let it swallow 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.120
 not immediately 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.360
 when it swallowed for a while, 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.940
 it pulls ... then I pull the cord 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.140
 But the fishing rod is very difficult to feel the rope at which it eats, ... 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.640
 Here, there are a number of kits, for example this is ... 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.140
 The set of snakehead fish has a lot of lead types and sizes and tongue sizes 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.720
 oh ... 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.540
 to throw away, throw near and fish big kids ... 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.140
 with sharks or hungry fish 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.120
 And this is tilapia 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.040
 This is a set of eels 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.960
 This is ... there are some big floats to ... 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.020
 carp 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.140
 ah my kit ... 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.080
 ... that's over. Now I will go to make fish meat 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.600
 Hello friends! ^^
