do a quick rundown on a cold boot from
atomic<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.789> atomic<00:00:18.390> hot<00:00:19.730> 97<00:00:20.840> Mike<00:00:21.840> one<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.260> the

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
atomic the atomic hot 97 Mike one of the

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.320 
atomic the atomic hot 97 Mike one of the
features<00:00:22.710> that<00:00:22.740> makes<00:00:23.189> me<00:00:23.310> as<00:00:23.400> Hawk<00:00:23.640> series<00:00:24.060> so

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
features that makes me as Hawk series so

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.330 
features that makes me as Hawk series so
unique<00:00:24.600> is<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.990> eye<00:00:25.170> flight<00:00:25.439> so<00:00:25.650> what's<00:00:26.039> that

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
unique is the eye flight so what's that

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.519 
unique is the eye flight so what's that
do<00:00:26.550> for<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.820> customer<00:00:27.210> well<00:00:27.660> essentially<00:00:28.109> it

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
do for the customer well essentially it

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.160 
do for the customer well essentially it
allows<00:00:28.560> for<00:00:28.800> better<00:00:29.250> balance<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:30.170> better

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
allows for better balance and better

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.650 
allows for better balance and better
pressuring<00:00:31.800> gets<00:00:32.460> allows<00:00:32.969> us<00:00:33.239> here<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.540> get

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
pressuring gets allows us here to get

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.319 
pressuring gets allows us here to get
the<00:00:33.750> weight<00:00:33.899> over<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.200> forefoot<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:35.329> gives

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
the weight over the forefoot and gives

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.470 
the weight over the forefoot and gives
them<00:00:36.510> better<00:00:36.719> precision<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.890> control

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
them better precision and control

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.090 
them better precision and control
essentially<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.629> I<00:00:39.660> flex<00:00:40.110> zones<00:00:40.379> are<00:00:40.829> right

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
essentially the I flex zones are right

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.040 
essentially the I flex zones are right
here<00:00:41.399> on<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.670> outside<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.180> shell<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.629> on

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
here on the outside of the shell and on

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.049 
here on the outside of the shell and on
the<00:00:43.260> inside<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.739> shell<00:00:43.920> here<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.520> that

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
the inside of the shell here and that

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.940 
the inside of the shell here and that
allows<00:00:45.360> for<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.750> natural<00:00:46.230> flex<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.800> we

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
allows for that natural flex that we

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.029 
allows for that natural flex that we
just<00:00:47.100> talked<00:00:47.399> about<00:00:47.430> cool<00:00:48.350> in<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.710> kind<00:00:49.920> of

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
just talked about cool in the kind of

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.470 
just talked about cool in the kind of
coincide<00:00:50.489> with<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.640> we've<00:00:50.850> got<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.030> more

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
coincide with that we've got a more

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.840 
coincide with that we've got a more
upright<00:00:52.050> forward<00:00:52.800> lean<00:00:52.980> here<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.489> domain

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
upright forward lean here to domain

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.600 
upright forward lean here to domain
right<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.570> do<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:54.780> again<00:00:55.710> less<00:00:56.070> forward<00:00:56.430> lean

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
right you do and again less forward lean

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.279 
right you do and again less forward lean
more<00:00:56.910> upright<00:00:57.239> stance<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.930> little<00:00:57.960> more

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
more upright stance a little more

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.650 
more upright stance a little more
athletic<00:00:58.500> stance<00:00:59.219> allows<00:00:59.789> for<00:01:00.090> less<00:01:00.270> fatigue

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
athletic stance allows for less fatigue

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.510 
athletic stance allows for less fatigue
on<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.960> quads<00:01:01.230> throughout<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.890> day<00:01:02.039> very

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
on the quads throughout the day very

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.189 
on the quads throughout the day very
cool<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:02.760> when<00:01:03.000> we<00:01:03.059> step<00:01:03.300> up<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.600> 90<00:01:03.989> we

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
cool and when we step up to the 90 we

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.020 
cool and when we step up to the 90 we
get<00:01:04.379> obviously<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.949> little<00:01:05.700> more<00:01:05.880> aggressive

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
get obviously a little more aggressive

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.780 
get obviously a little more aggressive
flex<00:01:06.570> than<00:01:06.720> we<00:01:06.810> do<00:01:06.900> over<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.200> 80<00:01:07.400> but<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.580> think

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
flex than we do over the 80 but I think

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.890 
flex than we do over the 80 but I think
one<00:01:08.880> of<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.030> cool<00:01:09.210> features<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.600> will

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
one of the cool features that will

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.840 
one of the cool features that will
really<00:01:10.110> help<00:01:10.200> performance<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.369> skier<00:01:11.729> is

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
really help performance of the skier is

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.300 
really help performance of the skier is
the<00:01:12.540> adjustable<00:01:13.229> cuff<00:01:13.439> right<00:01:13.770> right

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
the adjustable cuff right right

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.969 
the adjustable cuff right right
essentially<00:01:15.299> we<00:01:15.450> have<00:01:15.720> inside<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.619> outside

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
essentially we have inside and outside

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.149 
essentially we have inside and outside
cup<00:01:17.520> alignments<00:01:18.090> so<00:01:18.240> real<00:01:18.570> easily<00:01:19.290> inside<00:01:19.979> the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
cup alignments so real easily inside the

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.570 
cup alignments so real easily inside the
shop<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:21.060> can<00:01:21.270> be<00:01:21.450> adjusted<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.799> shaft

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
shop that can be adjusted to the shaft

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.880 
shop that can be adjusted to the shaft
of<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.060> lower<00:01:24.420> leg<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.170> consumer<00:01:25.740> right

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
of the lower leg of the consumer right

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.740 
of the lower leg of the consumer right
there<00:01:26.100> in<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.250> shop<00:01:26.520> so<00:01:26.790> guys<00:01:27.060> bowlegged<00:01:27.570> or

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
there in the shop so guys bowlegged or

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.810 
there in the shop so guys bowlegged or
not<00:01:27.900> need<00:01:28.140> help<00:01:28.619> correct<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.220> therefore

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
not need help correct that therefore

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.149 
not need help correct that therefore
he's<00:01:30.210> going<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.420> ski<00:01:30.840> flatter<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.500> better

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
he's going to ski flatter and better

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.609 
he's going to ski flatter and better
check<00:01:32.369> out<00:01:32.490> our<00:01:32.549> balance<00:01:33.000> better<00:01:33.409> very<00:01:34.409> cool

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
check out our balance better very cool

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.649 
check out our balance better very cool
oh<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.400> digging<00:01:35.820> into<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.090> liar<00:01:36.299> just<00:01:36.540> a

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
oh and digging into the liar just a

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.210 
oh and digging into the liar just a
little<00:01:36.869> bit<00:01:37.020> we've<00:01:37.229> still<00:01:37.619> got<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.890> four<00:01:38.100> way

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
little bit we've still got the four way

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.010 
little bit we've still got the four way
stretch<00:01:38.430> toe<00:01:38.759> box<00:01:39.000> which<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:39.689> going<00:01:39.960> to

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
stretch toe box which is going to

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.780 
stretch toe box which is going to
provide<00:01:40.290> additional<00:01:40.680> comfort<00:01:41.070> fit<00:01:41.520> right

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
provide additional comfort fit right

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:42.710 
provide additional comfort fit right
right<00:01:42.150> so

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
right so

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.480 
right so
you<00:01:42.930> know<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.170> four<00:01:43.380> way<00:01:43.500> stretch<00:01:43.770> provides<00:01:44.310> a

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
you know the four way stretch provides a

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.100 
you know the four way stretch provides a
way<00:01:44.640> for<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.970> foot<00:01:45.210> when<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.480> slid<00:01:45.750> into<00:01:45.930> the

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
way for the foot when it slid into the

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.010
