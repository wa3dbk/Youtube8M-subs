giant<00:00:45.149> tires<00:00:46.010> which<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.309> don't<00:00:47.370> like<00:00:47.579> so<00:00:47.700> much<00:00:48.030> I

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
giant tires which I don't like so much I

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.430 
giant tires which I don't like so much I
can<00:00:48.690> see<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.649> has<00:00:49.920> like<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.160> very<00:00:50.550> low<00:00:50.850> tread<00:00:51.440> not

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
can see it has like a very low tread not

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.740 
can see it has like a very low tread not
sure<00:00:52.620> if<00:00:52.800> it's<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.070> grip<00:00:53.489> if<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.360> grip<00:00:54.570> is

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
sure if it's the grip if the grip is

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.560 
sure if it's the grip if the grip is
good<00:00:55.170> enough<00:00:55.469> on<00:00:55.829> this<00:00:55.949> tire<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:56.730> probably<00:00:57.390> be

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
good enough on this tire so probably be

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.660 
good enough on this tire so probably be
changing<00:00:59.390> what<00:01:00.390> else<00:01:00.570> we<00:01:00.840> got<00:01:01.020> here<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:02.399> frame

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
changing what else we got here the frame

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.179 
changing what else we got here the frame
is<00:01:02.850> Alex<00:01:04.250> selenium<00:01:05.250> frame<00:01:06.350> so<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.799> bike<00:01:07.979> is

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
is Alex selenium frame so the bike is

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.050 
is Alex selenium frame so the bike is
really<00:01:08.460> light<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.420> really<00:01:09.900> good<00:01:11.060> for

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
really light and really good for

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.870 
really light and really good for
handling<00:01:12.710> so<00:01:13.710> we<00:01:14.010> have<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.340> remove<00:01:14.640> it

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
handling so we have to remove it

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.980 
handling so we have to remove it
pop<00:01:15.180> lock<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:17.490> shock<00:01:17.759> from<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.240> party<00:01:18.689> front

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990
