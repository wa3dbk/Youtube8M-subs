00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.910

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:17.919
 For now I am responding to 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.380
 questions that popped up on Facebook on 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:22.900
 The most disney group is a group only 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.240

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.189

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.230

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.950

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.690
 I 'm going to answer that same thing, Leticia. 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.710
 is the best age to take a child 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:47.140
 on disney with will be leticia help people 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.800
 well this is a question that a lot of people 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.270
 It really makes me a little 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.360
 personal opinion is going to tell me 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.370
 here I think from the six months 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.560
 already gives a child travel 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.750
 anywhere in the world it is clear that 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.910
 will depend a lot on your routine 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.429
 depends on how you chose to do the 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:09.009
 creating your child to and gives it to you 

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:11.020
 already has other children then older 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.850
 is not the first and you already want to pass 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.799
 holidays with the eldest do not 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.569
 no problem to lead you will not 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:19.420
 have no problem with the structure of the 

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:21.670
 park and you will have fun of course 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.439
 according to the limitations of your child. 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.359
 well for example went to disney 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:26.590
 first time at 11 months 

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:29.170
 we took advantage and made the first 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.630
 his haircut was super cool 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.700
 it's an amazing experience 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.689
 the child gets a little hat written 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.689
 for about 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:44.560
 so have things for all ages 

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:46.569
 Disney is 0 99 years later according to 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.310
 As they grow, it is clear that 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:51.459
 Difficulties change right 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:54.490
 You will need to have the child's rhythm. 

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:58.270
 you will need to respect the fatigue of the 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.639
 Child, but I can enjoy it, yes. 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.729
 super recommend I think a child 

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:06.039
 of about three years already 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.869
 will benefit park 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:09.250
 even though she does not remember everything 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.230
 when she grows up 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.330
 She will learn too much, too many. 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.159
 stimulation of small children 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.069
 love the stops 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:19.989
 children like the most 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.599
 Calm, I even have a video for you guys. 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:25.299
 with the ten coolest toys in a 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:27.760
 middle kingdom then you too can 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:30.220
 watch has several tips from the non- medical 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.140
 specifically but all the parks give 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.019
 to enjoy with children of several 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.939
 ages so I guess it does not stop 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.250
 travel because of the age of your child 

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:41.650
 every age will enjoy in a way 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.720
 Thank you for the wave help. 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.340
