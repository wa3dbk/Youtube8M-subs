I<00:00:58.539> chose<00:00:59.539> to<00:00:59.750> do<00:00:59.870> the<00:01:00.050> dual<00:01:00.260> degree<00:01:00.680> here<00:01:00.949> at

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
I chose to do the dual degree here at

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.639 
I chose to do the dual degree here at
LSU<00:01:01.309> because<00:01:02.180> I<00:01:02.600> don't<00:01:02.989> see<00:01:03.260> them<00:01:03.500> as<00:01:03.620> two

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.649 
LSU because I don't see them as two

LSU because I don't see them as two
separate<00:01:03.980> fields

separate fields

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.070 
separate fields
I<00:01:04.610> think<00:01:05.119> landscape<00:01:05.570> architecture<00:01:06.049> and

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
I think landscape architecture and

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.780 
I think landscape architecture and
architecture<00:01:06.680> are<00:01:06.860> really<00:01:07.220> just<00:01:07.400> the<00:01:07.490> design

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
architecture are really just the design

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.310 
architecture are really just the design
space<00:01:08.119> you're<00:01:08.659> just<00:01:08.869> working<00:01:09.020> at<00:01:09.200> different

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
space you're just working at different

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.700 
space you're just working at different
scales<00:01:09.740> and<00:01:09.979> with<00:01:10.130> different<00:01:10.310> mediums<00:01:11.710> the

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
scales and with different mediums the

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.380 
scales and with different mediums the
world<00:01:12.950> and<00:01:13.310> the<00:01:13.369> environment<00:01:13.880> can<00:01:13.940> be<00:01:14.000> sort<00:01:14.330> of

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
world and the environment can be sort of

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.639 
world and the environment can be sort of
intimidating<00:01:14.840> and<00:01:15.140> you<00:01:15.290> know<00:01:15.380> you<00:01:15.470> can't

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:15.649 
intimidating and you know you can't

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:17.469 
intimidating and you know you can't
really<00:01:15.770> control<00:01:16.040> it<00:01:16.159> so<00:01:16.610> for<00:01:16.790> us<00:01:16.909> the<00:01:17.119> graduate

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
really control it so for us the graduate

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.899 
really control it so for us the graduate

is<00:02:31.970> just<00:02:32.210> like<00:02:32.450> I<00:02:32.780> mean<00:02:33.620> that<00:02:33.650> that's<00:02:34.160> that's

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
is just like I mean that that's that's
