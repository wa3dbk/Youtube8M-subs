what's<00:00:03.510> really<00:00:04.140> unique<00:00:04.319> about<00:00:04.650> core<00:00:05.190> is<00:00:05.460> every

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
what's really unique about core is every

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.990 
what's really unique about core is every
part<00:00:06.720> on<00:00:06.899> it<00:00:07.109> does<00:00:07.440> like<00:00:07.830> five<00:00:08.099> jobs<00:00:08.460> I<00:00:08.790> mean<00:00:08.820> a

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
part on it does like five jobs I mean a

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.270 
part on it does like five jobs I mean a
designer's<00:00:09.660> goal<00:00:09.900> is<00:00:10.139> to<00:00:10.290> get<00:00:10.440> one<00:00:10.710> part<00:00:11.010> to<00:00:11.160> do

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
designer's goal is to get one part to do

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.089 
designer's goal is to get one part to do
two<00:00:11.519> different<00:00:11.759> jobs<00:00:12.179> but<00:00:12.599> encore<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.740> frame

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
two different jobs but encore the frame

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.279 
two different jobs but encore the frame
it<00:00:14.370> acts<00:00:14.549> as<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:14.910> steering<00:00:15.420> head<00:00:15.599> it<00:00:15.780> acts<00:00:15.990> as

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
it acts as the steering head it acts as

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.680 
it acts as the steering head it acts as
an<00:00:16.410> engine<00:00:16.890> mount<00:00:17.160> it<00:00:17.340> acts<00:00:17.550> as<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.760> gas<00:00:18.119> tank<00:00:18.539> it

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
an engine mount it acts as a gas tank it

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.540 
an engine mount it acts as a gas tank it
acts<00:00:18.900> as<00:00:19.080> an<00:00:19.199> air<00:00:19.410> box<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:20.039> most<00:00:20.250> unique

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
acts as an air box the most unique

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.400 
acts as an air box the most unique
feature<00:00:20.789> about<00:00:21.000> core<00:00:21.480> is<00:00:21.720> obviously<00:00:22.199> the

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
feature about core is obviously the

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.009 
feature about core is obviously the
frame<00:00:22.880> you<00:00:23.880> know<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.060> frame<00:00:24.300> is<00:00:24.449> integrated

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
frame you know the frame is integrated

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.380 
frame you know the frame is integrated
with<00:00:25.170> many<00:00:25.769> other<00:00:25.920> functions<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.760> overall<00:00:27.180> it

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
with many other functions and overall it

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.849 
with many other functions and overall it
simplifies<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.230> overall<00:00:28.560> design

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
simplifies the overall design

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.560 
simplifies the overall design
tremendously<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:29.820> don't<00:00:29.970> have<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.150> spend<00:00:30.359> too

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
tremendously you don't have to spend too

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.690 
tremendously you don't have to spend too
much<00:00:30.750> time<00:00:30.810> looking<00:00:31.529> at<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.460> kind<00:00:32.669> of

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
much time looking at it to kind of

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.069 
much time looking at it to kind of
realize<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.090> there's<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.570> lot<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:33.840> unique

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
realize that there's a lot of unique

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.810 
realize that there's a lot of unique
features<00:00:34.230> about<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.370> know<00:00:35.430> we<00:00:35.550> tear<00:00:35.730> this

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
features about it you know we tear this

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.280 
features about it you know we tear this
bike<00:00:36.059> down<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.510> put<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.750> back<00:00:36.870> together<00:00:37.020> again

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
bike down and put it back together again

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.400 
bike down and put it back together again
you<00:00:38.280> know<00:00:38.399> much<00:00:39.210> less<00:00:39.390> than<00:00:39.600> an<00:00:39.690> hour<00:00:39.930> well<00:00:40.320> the

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
you know much less than an hour well the

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.560 
you know much less than an hour well the
name<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.620> significant<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:41.610> think<00:00:41.670> in<00:00:42.180> that<00:00:42.329> it

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
name is significant I think in that it

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.470 
name is significant I think in that it
really<00:00:43.040> accurately<00:00:44.040> reflects<00:00:44.730> what<00:00:45.450> the

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
really accurately reflects what the

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.630 
really accurately reflects what the
bikes<00:00:45.750> all<00:00:45.960> about<00:00:46.200> it's<00:00:46.440> it's<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.980> essence<00:00:47.489> of

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
bikes all about it's it's the essence of

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.580 
bikes all about it's it's the essence of
a<00:00:47.700> motorcycle<00:00:48.300> so<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.510> sort<00:00:48.840> of<00:00:48.899> say<00:00:49.050> what's

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
a motorcycle so you sort of say what's

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.560 
a motorcycle so you sort of say what's
down<00:00:49.800> at<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.070> core<00:00:50.430> of<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.820> motorcycle<00:00:51.390> its

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
down at the core of the motorcycle its

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.160 
down at the core of the motorcycle its
wheels<00:00:51.960> its<00:00:52.710> engine<00:00:53.280> its<00:00:53.610> frame<00:00:54.030> it's<00:00:54.420> simple

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
wheels its engine its frame it's simple

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.350 
wheels its engine its frame it's simple
here<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.280> frame<00:00:56.520> more<00:00:56.910> or<00:00:57.000> less<00:00:57.149> is<00:00:57.329> the

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
here the frame more or less is the

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.900 
here the frame more or less is the
strongest<00:00:58.170> design<00:00:58.530> element<00:00:58.949> both<00:00:59.370> visually

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
strongest design element both visually

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.880 
strongest design element both visually
and<00:01:00.120> structurally<00:01:00.899> when<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.379> look<00:01:01.590> at<00:01:01.739> that

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
and structurally when you look at that

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.979 
and structurally when you look at that
chassis<00:01:02.219> though<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.850> serves<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:03.930> many

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
chassis though that serves so many

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.760 
chassis though that serves so many
purposes<00:01:04.700> I<00:01:05.700> think<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.840> core<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.229> perfect

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
purposes I think the core is a perfect

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:08.990 
purposes I think the core is a perfect
name<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.130> also<00:01:08.250> has<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.520> lot<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.760> do<00:01:08.850> with<00:01:08.880> the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
name it also has a lot to do with the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.280 
name it also has a lot to do with the
way<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.119> bikes<00:01:09.360> made<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:10.080> know<00:01:10.170> it's

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
way the bikes made you know it's

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.609 
way the bikes made you know it's
sand-cast<00:01:10.830> frame<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:12.270> has<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.840> core<00:01:13.229> the

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
sand-cast frame and it has a core the

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.170 
sand-cast frame and it has a core the
division<00:01:14.010> between<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.400> airbox<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:14.939> fuel

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
division between the airbox of the fuel

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.810 
division between the airbox of the fuel
tank<00:01:15.420> for<00:01:15.570> example<00:01:15.659> are<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:17.280> know<00:01:17.700> these

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
tank for example are you know these

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.670 
tank for example are you know these
different<00:01:18.000> sand<00:01:18.600> cores<00:01:18.900> in<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.350> in<00:01:19.619> that

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
different sand cores in that in that

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.429 
different sand cores in that in that
casting<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.729> we<00:01:20.880> like<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.270> they<00:01:21.570> read<00:01:21.840> on<00:01:22.080> a

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
casting so we like that they read on a

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.170 
casting so we like that they read on a
lot<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:23.009> different<00:01:23.310> levels<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.850> victory

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
lot of different levels the victory

throughout<00:01:39.840> this<00:01:40.049> motorcycle<00:01:40.439> victory<00:01:41.220> is

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
throughout this motorcycle victory is

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.679 
throughout this motorcycle victory is
loaded<00:01:41.880> with<00:01:42.030> surprises

loaded with surprises
I<00:01:42.780> think<00:01:43.049> victory<00:01:43.530> has<00:01:43.649> done<00:01:43.890> more<00:01:44.159> in<00:01:44.310> the

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
I think victory has done more in the

done<00:01:46.860> in<00:01:46.979> their<00:01:47.100> lifetime<00:01:47.549> certainly<00:01:48.000> a

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
done in their lifetime certainly a

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.300 
done in their lifetime certainly a
snapshot<00:01:48.509> for<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:48.990> public<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.950> types<00:01:50.189> of

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310
