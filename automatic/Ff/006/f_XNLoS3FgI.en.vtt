scattered<00:00:23.310> in<00:00:23.460> here<00:00:23.760> but<00:00:24.750> more<00:00:25.619> than<00:00:25.769> not<00:00:25.830> it's

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
scattered in here but more than not it's

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.269

just<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.910> long<00:00:27.510> little<00:00:27.930> loading<00:00:28.650> screen<00:00:29.039> I'm

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
just a long little loading screen I'm

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.160 
just a long little loading screen I'm
guessing<00:00:29.699> is<00:00:29.820> probably<00:00:30.179> what<00:00:30.359> its<00:00:30.510> treated<00:00:30.990> as

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
guessing is probably what its treated as

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.889 
guessing is probably what its treated as
