so<00:01:41.970> there<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.600> first<00:01:43.020> curl<00:01:43.500> it's<00:01:43.950> not

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
so there is the first curl it's not

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.429 
so there is the first curl it's not
technically<00:01:44.850> an<00:01:45.119> actual<00:01:45.659> curl<00:01:45.899> as<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.229> see

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
technically an actual curl as you see

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.010 
technically an actual curl as you see
it's<00:01:46.680> really<00:01:47.040> just<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.430> nice<00:01:47.700> wave<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.659> love

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
sure there's no tangles think about like

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.930 
sure there's no tangles think about like
an<00:02:05.130> inch<00:02:05.750> take<00:02:06.750> your<00:02:06.960> iron<00:02:07.140> facing<00:02:07.950> down<00:02:08.220> wrap

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
an inch take your iron facing down wrap

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.490 
an inch take your iron facing down wrap
the<00:02:09.149> first<00:02:09.390> one<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.690> first<00:02:09.810> one<00:02:09.929> can<00:02:10.140> be<00:02:10.259> flat

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
the first one the first one can be flat

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.490 
the first one the first one can be flat
then<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.190> next<00:02:11.580> one's<00:02:11.780> twist<00:02:12.780> your<00:02:13.020> wrist

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
then the next one's twist your wrist

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.590 
then the next one's twist your wrist
like<00:02:13.830> that<00:02:14.160> so<00:02:14.430> you're<00:02:14.520> just<00:02:14.550> twisting<00:02:15.300> the

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
like that so you're just twisting the

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.780 
like that so you're just twisting the
pieces<00:02:15.990> it's<00:02:16.230> very<00:02:16.500> confusing<00:02:16.860> but<00:02:17.340> once<00:02:17.550> you

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
pieces it's very confusing but once you

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.940 
pieces it's very confusing but once you
practice<00:02:18.390> you<00:02:18.630> will<00:02:18.810> get<00:02:19.080> it<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:19.530> then<00:02:19.650> let<00:02:19.770> go

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
practice you will get it and then let go

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.460 
practice you will get it and then let go
and<00:02:20.220> then<00:02:20.430> there's<00:02:20.760> another<00:02:21.150> wave<00:02:21.450> I<00:02:21.780> love

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
and then there's another wave I love

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.470 
and then there's another wave I love
this<00:02:22.620> technique<00:02:22.950> so<00:02:23.160> much<00:02:23.310> I<00:02:23.610> actually<00:02:23.970> Danny

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
this technique so much I actually Danny

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.000 
this technique so much I actually Danny
and<00:02:24.660> look<00:02:24.780> up<00:02:24.960> how<00:02:25.140> to<00:02:25.200> create<00:02:25.590> waves<00:02:25.770> I

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
and look up how to create waves I

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.880 
and look up how to create waves I
literally<00:02:26.310> just<00:02:26.900> experimented<00:02:27.900> like<00:02:28.350> curling

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
literally just experimented like curling

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.320 
literally just experimented like curling
my<00:02:28.980> hair<00:02:29.010> I<00:02:29.250> was<00:02:29.400> like<00:02:29.640> oh<00:02:29.730> my<00:02:29.880> god<00:02:30.060> just<00:02:30.180> like

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
my hair I was like oh my god just like

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.870 
my hair I was like oh my god just like
twist<00:02:30.630> it<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:31.020> then<00:02:31.560> that<00:02:32.070> so<00:02:32.460> what<00:02:32.550> happened

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
twist it and then that so what happened

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.900 
twist it and then that so what happened
so<00:02:33.150> there's<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:33.840> first<00:02:34.050> two<00:02:34.380> wavy<00:02:34.890> curls<00:02:35.670> and

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
so there's the first two wavy curls and

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.930 
so there's the first two wavy curls and
I'm<00:02:36.390> gonna<00:02:36.510> do<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.930> whole<00:02:37.140> head<00:02:37.380> now<00:02:37.590> so<00:02:38.130> let's

I'll<00:03:44.180> comb<00:03:44.450> it<00:03:44.629> out<00:03:45.579> so<00:03:46.579> I<00:03:46.909> just<00:03:47.349> do<00:03:48.349> the<00:03:48.500> twisty

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
I'll comb it out so I just do the twisty

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.250 
I'll comb it out so I just do the twisty
thing<00:03:49.099> away<00:03:49.310> from<00:03:49.489> my<00:03:49.609> face<00:03:49.849> so<00:03:50.510> basically<00:03:51.079> the

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
thing away from my face so basically the

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.580 
thing away from my face so basically the
same<00:03:51.379> thing<00:03:51.590> I've<00:03:51.680> been<00:03:51.709> doing<00:03:51.829> whoops<00:03:53.590> so

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
same thing I've been doing whoops so

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.140 
same thing I've been doing whoops so
there<00:03:54.739> is<00:03:54.889> the<00:03:55.069> first<00:03:55.280> curl

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
there is the first curl

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.259 
there is the first curl
I<00:03:56.420> am<00:03:56.900> obsessed<00:03:57.079> with<00:03:57.829> this<00:03:58.549> technique<00:03:59.000> like

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
I am obsessed with this technique like

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:03.699 
I am obsessed with this technique like
look<00:03:59.959> how<00:04:00.170> just<00:04:01.269> nice<00:04:02.269> and<00:04:02.299> like<00:04:02.870> full<00:04:03.349> it<00:04:03.590> is
