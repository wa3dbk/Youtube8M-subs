00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
to last very long so this is the liver

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.590 
to last very long so this is the liver
that<00:03:04.880> releases<00:03:05.660> the<00:03:05.680> hidden<00:03:06.680> blade<00:03:07.390> so<00:03:08.390> when

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
that releases the hidden blade so when

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.070 
that releases the hidden blade so when
the<00:03:08.750> humid<00:03:09.140> it<00:03:09.290> comes<00:03:09.530> it<00:03:10.280> jams<00:03:10.940> it<00:03:11.150> here<00:03:11.420> and

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
the humid it comes it jams it here and

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.910 
the humid it comes it jams it here and
when<00:03:12.320> you<00:03:12.470> pull<00:03:12.709> the<00:03:12.739> string<00:03:13.250> here<00:03:13.870> it's

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
when you pull the string here it's

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.400 
when you pull the string here it's
releases<00:03:15.920> the<00:03:16.070> humid<00:03:16.459> and<00:03:16.700> it<00:03:17.630> has<00:03:17.959> it<00:03:18.230> has

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
releases the humid and it has it has

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.789 
releases the humid and it has it has
this<00:03:18.769> spring<00:03:19.459> that<00:03:19.850> holds<00:03:19.910> it<00:03:20.420> back<00:03:20.780> and<00:03:21.590> forth

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
this spring that holds it back and forth

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.690 
this spring that holds it back and forth
XO<00:03:22.760> anytime<00:03:23.299> the<00:03:23.900> spring<00:03:24.230> moves<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:25.340> jam<00:03:25.670> it

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
XO anytime the spring moves and jam it

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.090 
XO anytime the spring moves and jam it
when<00:03:26.360> you<00:03:26.480> pull<00:03:26.900> and<00:03:27.290> then<00:03:27.320> make<00:03:28.150> so<00:03:29.150> that's

you'll have with this little piece here
it's<00:03:36.260> really<00:03:36.590> important<00:03:37.070> because<00:03:37.579> when<00:03:37.940> the

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
it's really important because when the

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.490 
it's really important because when the
hidden<00:03:38.299> blade<00:03:38.450> is<00:03:38.630> going<00:03:38.870> going<00:03:39.049> going<00:03:39.260> going

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
hidden blade is going going going going

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.449 
hidden blade is going going going going
and<00:03:40.000> if<00:03:41.000> this<00:03:41.450> one<00:03:42.170> here<00:03:42.560> it<00:03:42.799> would<00:03:42.980> take<00:03:43.280> off

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
and if this one here it would take off

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.420 
and if this one here it would take off
in<00:03:43.730> a<00:03:43.820> row<00:03:44.209> straight<00:03:44.540> direction<00:03:45.049> so<00:03:45.680> you<00:03:46.160> need

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
in a row straight direction so you need

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.220 
in a row straight direction so you need
this<00:03:46.700> piece<00:03:46.970> to<00:03:47.150> be<00:03:47.269> really<00:03:47.600> strong<00:03:47.840> because

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
this piece to be really strong because

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.170 
this piece to be really strong because
every<00:03:48.680> time<00:03:48.709> that<00:03:49.070> is<00:03:49.250> gone<00:03:49.519> it's<00:03:49.730> hideous

hideous hideous so if this is not really
strong<00:03:53.239> it's<00:03:53.480> going<00:03:53.690> to<00:03:53.900> fly<00:03:54.140> away<00:03:54.730> and<00:03:55.730> this
