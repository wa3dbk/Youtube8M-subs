definitely say that
it<00:02:01.540> is<00:02:02.540> why<00:02:02.810> I<00:02:02.840> did<00:02:03.200> cut<00:02:03.620> like<00:02:03.890> a<00:02:03.920> little<00:02:04.340> um<00:02:05.270> I

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
it is why I did cut like a little um I

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.670 
it is why I did cut like a little um I
did<00:02:07.040> cut<00:02:07.340> just<00:02:07.640> um<00:02:07.880> in<00:02:08.060> there<00:02:08.270> I<00:02:08.540> guess<00:02:09.140> some<00:02:09.410> on

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:09.680 
did cut just um in there I guess some on

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.260 
did cut just um in there I guess some on
this<00:02:09.950> side<00:02:10.009> aside<00:02:10.430> like<00:02:10.520> a<00:02:10.640> little<00:02:10.850> soup<00:02:11.090> and

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
this side aside like a little soup and

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.030 
this side aside like a little soup and
then<00:02:11.360> have<00:02:11.480> like<00:02:11.600> a<00:02:11.660> layer<00:02:12.020> and<00:02:12.770> they<00:02:12.860> have

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
then have like a layer and they have

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.790 
then have like a layer and they have
some<00:02:13.310> down<00:02:13.580> I<00:02:14.030> think<00:02:14.750> I<00:02:14.870> like<00:02:15.200> it<00:02:15.380> like<00:02:15.530> that

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
some down I think I like it like that
