00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690

wild just about and they have been
spawning<00:00:34.100> so<00:00:35.100> they're<00:00:35.190> not<00:00:35.280> as<00:00:35.399> common<00:00:35.730> as<00:00:35.790> you

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910

can see as a lot other things however to
these<00:00:38.700> two<00:00:38.850> have<00:00:38.969> spawned<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.570> haven't

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
these two have spawned I haven't

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.110 
these two have spawned I haven't
actually<00:00:40.469> seen<00:00:40.680> any<00:00:40.800> others<00:00:41.160> yet<00:00:41.370> but<00:00:41.850> this<00:00:42.000> is

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
actually seen any others yet but this is

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.850 
actually seen any others yet but this is
new<00:00:42.300> so<00:00:42.540> now<00:00:42.809> if<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.110> get<00:00:43.230> playing<00:00:43.500> on<00:00:43.649> like<00:00:43.829> a

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
new so now if you get playing on like a

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.130 
new so now if you get playing on like a
hard<00:00:44.160> difficulty<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:45.239> may<00:00:45.420> find<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.960> little

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
hard difficulty you may find a little

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.450 
hard difficulty you may find a little
bit<00:00:46.230> harder<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.559> live<00:00:46.710> at<00:00:46.860> night<00:00:47.010> because<00:00:47.309> of

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
bit harder to live at night because of

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.970 
bit harder to live at night because of
the<00:00:47.579> witches<00:00:48.530> but<00:00:49.530> yeah<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.620> think<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:49.890> is

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
the witches but yeah I think this is

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.340 
the witches but yeah I think this is
pretty<00:00:50.129> cool<00:00:50.250> anyway<00:00:50.700> it's<00:00:51.420> quite<00:00:51.660> quite<00:00:52.199> cool

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
pretty cool anyway it's quite quite cool

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.799 
pretty cool anyway it's quite quite cool

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
you will know that you pretty much

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.100 
you will know that you pretty much
couldn't<00:01:11.580> see<00:01:11.729> through<00:01:11.970> here<00:01:12.150> however

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
couldn't see through here however

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.719 
couldn't see through here however
personally<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.890> really<00:01:14.159> like<00:01:14.369> this<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.640> can

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
personally I to really like this you can

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.280 
personally I to really like this you can
kind<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:14.939> see<00:01:15.030> through<00:01:15.330> now<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.509> colors<00:01:15.930> kind

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
kind of see through now the colors kind

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.240 
kind of see through now the colors kind
of<00:01:16.439> not<00:01:16.650> as<00:01:16.830> strong<00:01:17.340> though<00:01:18.470> but<00:01:19.470> still<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:20.009> I

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
of not as strong though but still you I

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.499 
of not as strong though but still you I
think<00:01:20.490> like<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:20.820> sorting<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.240> looks<00:01:21.390> really

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
think like this sorting it looks really

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.359 
think like this sorting it looks really
cool<00:01:21.689> as<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.869> can<00:01:21.990> see<00:01:22.200> like<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.619> church<00:01:23.159> from

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
cool as you can see like the church from

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.760 
cool as you can see like the church from
the<00:01:23.549> inside<00:01:23.880> from<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.900> outside<00:01:25.020> like<00:01:25.530> more

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
the inside from the outside like more

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.800 
the inside from the outside like more
clear<00:01:26.009> as<00:01:26.189> if<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:26.909> was<00:01:27.030> normal<00:01:27.060> glass<00:01:27.509> which<00:01:27.750> i

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
clear as if it was normal glass which i

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.109 
clear as if it was normal glass which i
think<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:28.020> good<00:01:28.259> this<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.189> not<00:01:29.310> just<00:01:29.820> for<00:01:29.939> these

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
think is good this is not just for these

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.749 
think is good this is not just for these
all<00:01:30.420> blocks<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.869> change<00:01:31.079> as<00:01:31.229> well<00:01:31.579> all<00:01:32.579> the

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
all blocks of change as well all the

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.730 
all blocks of change as well all the
glass<00:01:32.970> blocks<00:01:33.329> have<00:01:33.509> changed<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.320> colored

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
glass blocks have changed that colored

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.620 
glass blocks have changed that colored
as<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:35.280> can<00:01:35.369> see<00:01:35.579> these<00:01:35.820> are<00:01:35.880> so<00:01:36.479> much

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
as you can see these are so much

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.510 
as you can see these are so much
brighter<00:01:36.840> now<00:01:37.110> though<00:01:37.740> are<00:01:37.860> not<00:01:38.009> bright<00:01:38.220> sorry

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
brighter now though are not bright sorry

through<00:01:42.420> them<00:01:42.689> which<00:01:43.470> is<00:01:43.649> good<00:01:43.950> so<00:01:44.280> there's

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
through them which is good so there's

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.399 
through them which is good so there's
not<00:01:44.670> much<00:01:44.790> changed<00:01:45.090> apart<00:01:45.750> from<00:01:45.869> simply<00:01:46.290> the

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
not much changed apart from simply the

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.069 
not much changed apart from simply the
transparency<00:01:47.119> the<00:01:48.119> color<00:01:48.390> i<00:01:48.570> think<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:48.869> stayed

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
transparency the color i think is stayed

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.749 
transparency the color i think is stayed
pretty<00:01:49.320> much<00:01:49.439> exactly<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.979> same<00:01:50.189> is<00:01:50.399> simply

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
pretty much exactly the same is simply

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.149 
pretty much exactly the same is simply
just<00:01:51.030> high<00:01:52.020> transparency<00:01:54.680> ok<00:01:55.680> so<00:01:55.740> next<00:01:55.950> we'll

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
just high transparency ok so next we'll

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.760 
just high transparency ok so next we'll
have<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.430> show<00:01:56.549> you<00:01:56.610> is<00:01:56.820> more<00:01:57.149> letters<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.200> can

i'll quickly place these and then see

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:48.629 
i'll quickly place these and then see
what<00:02:44.980> difference<00:02:45.340> it<00:02:45.430> makes<00:02:45.609> to<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:45.760> map<00:02:47.639> ok

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:48.639 
what difference it makes to the map ok

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:50.129 
what difference it makes to the map ok
so<00:02:48.700> the<00:02:48.879> maps<00:02:49.030> quickly<00:02:49.389> update<00:02:49.510> and<00:02:49.840> now<00:02:49.870> from

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:50.139 
so the maps quickly update and now from

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:51.330 
so the maps quickly update and now from
weather<00:02:50.290> blocks<00:02:50.530> out<00:02:50.709> of<00:02:50.799> place<00:02:50.980> but<00:02:51.010> as<00:02:51.250> you

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
weather blocks out of place but as you

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.890 
weather blocks out of place but as you

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
the wool appear on the map which i

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.509 
the wool appear on the map which i
personally<00:02:55.209> think<00:02:55.690> is<00:02:55.840> really<00:02:56.260> cool

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519

00:02:58.649 --> 00:02:58.659 
especially for like kind of custom apps

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:00.449 
especially for like kind of custom apps
and<00:02:58.810> stuff<00:02:58.870> like<00:02:59.019> that<00:02:59.079> it's<00:02:59.709> easier<00:03:00.099> now<00:03:00.280> if

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
and stuff like that it's easier now if

and stuff like that it's easier now if
you've<00:03:00.609> got<00:03:00.730> if<00:03:00.879> you've<00:03:01.030> got<00:03:01.299> a<00:03:01.329> map<00:03:01.569> you<00:03:01.750> can

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
you've got if you've got a map you can

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.599 
you've got if you've got a map you can
see<00:03:01.930> where<00:03:02.290> you<00:03:02.379> need<00:03:02.530> to<00:03:02.620> get<00:03:02.799> to<00:03:02.980> from<00:03:03.310> the

colored<00:03:04.139> marks<00:03:05.139> on<00:03:05.319> the<00:03:05.439> map<00:03:07.799> ok<00:03:08.799> so<00:03:08.859> also<00:03:09.310> what

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
colored marks on the map ok so also what

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.399 
colored marks on the map ok so also what
i<00:03:09.519> have<00:03:09.730> here<00:03:09.909> is<00:03:10.090> blue<00:03:10.420> stained<00:03:10.780> clay<00:03:11.139> and

blue stained wool so this supposed to be
on<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:15.220> map<00:03:15.430> a<00:03:15.609> slight<00:03:16.000> difference<00:03:16.569> in<00:03:16.810> the

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
on the map a slight difference in the

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.659 
on the map a slight difference in the
shading<00:03:17.530> and<00:03:17.769> to<00:03:18.040> show<00:03:18.220> the<00:03:18.340> difference
