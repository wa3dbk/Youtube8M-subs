the teachers have made a huge difference
well<00:03:17.310> I'm<00:03:17.549> not<00:03:17.760> a<00:03:17.819> policy<00:03:18.209> wonk<00:03:18.540> you<00:03:18.900> know<00:03:19.079> a

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
well I'm not a policy wonk you know a

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:20.479 
well I'm not a policy wonk you know a
lot<00:03:19.290> more<00:03:19.319> about<00:03:19.650> it<00:03:19.739> than<00:03:19.769> I<00:03:19.950> do<00:03:20.010> but<00:03:20.220> I<00:03:20.340> have

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
lot more about it than I do but I have

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.910 
lot more about it than I do but I have
seen<00:03:20.670> a<00:03:20.730> lot<00:03:20.819> of<00:03:21.060> Hollywood<00:03:21.630> movies<00:03:21.989> about

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920

seen a lot of Hollywood movies about
schools<00:03:23.880> and<00:03:24.299> I<00:03:24.540> think<00:03:24.810> what<00:03:24.989> schools<00:03:25.350> need<00:03:25.680> is

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
schools and I think what schools need is

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.229 
schools and I think what schools need is
a<00:03:25.980> very<00:03:26.310> caring<00:03:26.730> white<00:03:26.970> person<00:03:28.700> it<00:03:29.700> goes<00:03:30.030> to

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
a very caring white person it goes to

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.110 
a very caring white person it goes to
the<00:03:30.269> inner<00:03:30.569> city<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:31.609> teaches<00:03:32.609> that<00:03:32.730> the<00:03:32.880> math

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
the inner city and teaches that the math

right now it's up to forty five percent
that's<00:05:40.050> a<00:05:40.260> good<00:05:40.470> thing<00:05:40.830> yeah<00:05:41.220> but<00:05:42.060> it<00:05:42.150> does

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
that's a good thing yeah but it does

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.090 
that's a good thing yeah but it does
take<00:05:42.540> a<00:05:42.600> while<00:05:42.750> for<00:05:42.960> progress<00:05:43.740> to<00:05:43.919> be<00:05:43.950> made

with people who have to catch up

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:48.529 
with people who have to catch up
absolutely<00:05:47.039> and<00:05:47.190> that's<00:05:47.400> why<00:05:47.729> we<00:05:48.060> have<00:05:48.270> to

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:48.539 
absolutely and that's why we have to

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:50.220 
absolutely and that's why we have to
make<00:05:49.140> sure<00:05:49.169> that<00:05:49.740> we

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:50.230 
make sure that we

because I think what bothers a lot of
people<00:06:16.600> in<00:06:16.810> America<00:06:17.290> is<00:06:17.410> why<00:06:17.680> did<00:06:17.860> teachers

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280 
people in America is why did teachers

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.330 
people in America is why did teachers
get<00:06:18.610> this<00:06:19.110> this<00:06:20.110> perk<00:06:20.500> that<00:06:20.740> the<00:06:20.860> rest<00:06:21.040> of<00:06:21.220> us

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:21.340 
get this this perk that the rest of us

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.520 
get this this perk that the rest of us
don't<00:06:21.520> have<00:06:21.640> we<00:06:21.880> can<00:06:21.910> all<00:06:22.240> be<00:06:22.450> fired<00:06:22.780> but<00:06:23.380> let

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.310 
make sense the Supreme Court has it area

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.980 
make sense the Supreme Court has it area
right<00:06:30.640> the<00:06:30.790> supreme<00:06:31.180> where<00:06:31.330> you<00:06:31.450> can't<00:06:31.690> fire

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:31.990 
right the supreme where you can't fire

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.320 
right the supreme where you can't fire
Supreme<00:06:32.530> Court<00:06:32.920> justice<00:06:33.400> because<00:06:34.060> they<00:06:34.180> have

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:34.330 
Supreme Court justice because they have

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.000 
Supreme Court justice because they have
to<00:06:34.510> make<00:06:34.690> very<00:06:34.930> hard<00:06:35.200> decisions<00:06:35.740> and<00:06:35.890> you

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:36.010 
to make very hard decisions and you

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:37.380 
to make very hard decisions and you
wouldn't<00:06:36.310> want<00:06:36.460> to<00:06:36.550> hold<00:06:36.760> the<00:06:36.850> mikado<00:06:37.180> say

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:37.390 
wouldn't want to hold the mikado say

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:38.790 
wouldn't want to hold the mikado say
well<00:06:37.600> we<00:06:37.750> didn't<00:06:37.930> like<00:06:38.080> the<00:06:38.230> decision<00:06:38.650> you've

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 
well we didn't like the decision you've

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.440 
well we didn't like the decision you've
got<00:06:38.950> to<00:06:39.040> go<00:06:39.160> it's<00:06:39.610> kind<00:06:39.790> of<00:06:39.910> the<00:06:40.030> same<00:06:40.060> thing

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:40.450 
got to go it's kind of the same thing

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:43.200 
got to go it's kind of the same thing
with<00:06:40.570> teachers<00:06:40.900> I<00:06:41.020> mean<00:06:41.290> a<00:06:41.500> teacher<00:06:42.430> has<00:06:42.790> to<00:06:43.060> be

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:43.210 
with teachers I mean a teacher has to be

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:45.720 
with teachers I mean a teacher has to be
able<00:06:43.360> to<00:06:43.780> say<00:06:44.200> to<00:06:44.260> parents<00:06:44.560> your<00:06:45.100> kid<00:06:45.340> is<00:06:45.490> done

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:45.730 
able to say to parents your kid is done

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:51.540 
able to say to parents your kid is done
yeah<00:06:47.670> because<00:06:48.960> I'm<00:06:49.960> not<00:06:50.680> getting<00:06:50.980> fired<00:06:51.250> but

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:51.550 
yeah because I'm not getting fired but

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.100 
yeah because I'm not getting fired but
because<00:06:51.790> that's<00:06:52.000> all<00:06:52.270> very<00:06:52.300> often<00:06:52.960> the<00:06:53.080> answer

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:53.110 
because that's all very often the answer

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:54.960 
because that's all very often the answer
is<00:06:53.620> that<00:06:53.650> you<00:06:54.040> know<00:06:54.160> because<00:06:54.490> the<00:06:54.760> parents

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:54.970 
is that you know because the parents

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.300 
is that you know because the parents
it's<00:06:55.420> never<00:06:55.720> their<00:06:56.110> precious<00:06:56.530> child<00:06:57.010> that's

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:57.310 
it's never their precious child that's

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:00.090 
it's never their precious child that's
the<00:06:57.460> problem<00:06:58.320> teachers<00:06:59.320> do<00:06:59.590> have<00:06:59.800> to<00:06:59.920> make

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:00.100 
the problem teachers do have to make

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.330 
the problem teachers do have to make
hard<00:07:00.430> calls<00:07:00.730> and<00:07:01.060> they<00:07:01.480> they<00:07:01.810> have<00:07:01.990> to<00:07:02.140> have

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:02.340 
hard calls and they they have to have

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.620 
hard calls and they they have to have
protections<00:07:03.340> to<00:07:03.430> make<00:07:03.670> sure<00:07:03.910> that<00:07:04.270> you<00:07:04.510> know

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:04.630

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:06.310 
when when they are making those tough

the<00:07:10.780> problem<00:07:11.560> in<00:07:11.680> public<00:07:11.980> education<00:07:12.070> is<00:07:12.730> that

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:13.060 
the problem in public education is that

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.330 
the problem in public education is that

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:17.850 
regardless of performance and so we have

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:20.970 
regardless of performance and so we have
some<00:07:18.850> people<00:07:19.090> who<00:07:19.540> are<00:07:19.750> not<00:07:20.200> doing<00:07:20.590> the<00:07:20.830> right

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:20.980
