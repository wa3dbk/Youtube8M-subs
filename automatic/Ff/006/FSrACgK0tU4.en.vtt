 which is organza ribbon and lace so that 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.259

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.720
 they also serve 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:49.979
 this is a very very versatile piece 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.929
 that you really cheer up 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.270
 make third parties with them that the 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:56.880
 people like a lot the clients are left 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.329

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.219
 elegant and they also turn you off 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.429
 they use inexpensive materials to 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.959
 can elaborate them and then like this 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:08.849
 the rosette is the only thing that we are going to 

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:12.430
 to do is the decoration of the little flower 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:15.770
 in buttons let's start applying 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:20.870
 silicon I recommend that the 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:22.460
 circulito is very tiny because if 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.290
 we make it big we are going to notice what 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.390
 which is the white part of the inmate 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.620
 then it is advisable that you 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.709
 make 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.580
 well tiny what is the circle 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:36.580
 they start to paste 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.660
 the buttons that's very simple very 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.030
 easy 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.330
 have to give it to me is round 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.190
 there before the silicone dries 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.990
 you can move the buttons 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:52.490
 so that you can fit in here 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:56.470
 fortunately he gave us but like 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.470
 what do I tell you, you have to 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.920
 give it the shape as the buttons have 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.319
 these are some that do not bring these pieces 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:09.459
 of these sheets ready to be able to elaborate 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:11.470
 the buttons must be pressed against 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.569
 the table so that it stays so that it 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.760
 Do not crush anymore and you can hit them 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:20.410
 you can not work with the tip 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:23.080
 then it is a detail or ask this what 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:26.420
 which are the caps are called the 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.520
 caps without the eye for 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.190
 without this eyelet milestone they will get it 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.230
 you can get them ready already when 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.500
 have the shape of the flower to apply 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.840
 hot or cold silicone and they're going to stick 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.250
 another button of a different color to 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.830
 that they look good, they let it dry 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.810
 they can make a lot of flowers 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.780
