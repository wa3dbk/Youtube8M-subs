stadium<00:00:12.630> for<00:00:13.019> charity<00:00:13.440> do<00:00:13.590> I<00:00:13.620> think<00:00:13.830> it's

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
stadium for charity do I think it's

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.530

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
necessary what's the chances of it

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.070 
necessary what's the chances of it
happening<00:00:15.710> so<00:00:16.710> this<00:00:17.250> is<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.580> video<00:00:17.820> um<00:00:18.180> the

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
happening so this is the video um the

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.019 
happening so this is the video um the
first<00:00:19.320> thing<00:00:19.590> is<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:19.800> do<00:00:19.859> think<00:00:20.490> we<00:00:20.820> all<00:00:21.000> agree

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
first thing is I do think we all agree

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.509 
first thing is I do think we all agree
that<00:00:21.359> chassis<00:00:21.840> does<00:00:22.050> need<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.320> get<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:22.920> bigger

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
that chassis does need to get a bigger

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.640 
that chassis does need to get a bigger
stadium<00:00:24.060> if<00:00:24.269> thats<00:00:24.510> redeveloping<00:00:25.170> stamford

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
stadium if thats redeveloping stamford

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.150

bridge<00:00:25.680> if<00:00:26.160> that<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.210> moving<00:00:27.900> if<00:00:28.140> you<00:00:28.980> know<00:00:29.130> I

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
bridge if that is moving if you know I

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.800 
bridge if that is moving if you know I
think<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.609> does<00:00:29.789> need<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.029> happen<00:00:30.179> for<00:00:30.539> us<00:00:30.599> to

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
think it does need to happen for us to

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.479 
think it does need to happen for us to
go<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.199> next<00:00:31.410> level<00:00:31.800> is<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.890> club<00:00:32.189> we<00:00:32.340> need<00:00:32.460> a

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
stay at Stamford Bridge but I'm a big

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.150

fan<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:51.809> know<00:00:51.930> pushing<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.620> club<00:00:52.860> forward

and<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.879> thought<00:00:54.059> going<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:55.079> stadium<00:00:55.559> a

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
and I thought going to a that stadium a

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.470 
and I thought going to a that stadium a
bigger<00:00:55.890> stadium<00:00:56.219> would<00:00:56.820> be<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.090> right<00:00:57.180> way<00:00:57.329> we

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
bigger stadium would be the right way we

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.819 
bigger stadium would be the right way we
didn't<00:00:57.719> get<00:00:57.870> planning<00:00:58.260> permission<00:00:58.289> for<00:00:58.649> that

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
didn't get planning permission for that

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.250 
didn't get planning permission for that
so<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.219> was<00:00:59.399> um<00:00:59.609> you<00:01:00.480> know<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.780> this<00:01:00.899> didn't

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
so that was um you know that this didn't

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.900 
so that was um you know that this didn't
happen<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.739> then<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:01.980> was<00:01:02.070> rumored<00:01:02.370> oh<00:01:02.520> you

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
know chassis were pretty much stuck and

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.440

there's nowhere for him to go at this

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.499 
there's nowhere for him to go at this

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
stamp for a bridge I think that's a good

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.679 
stamp for a bridge I think that's a good
idea<00:01:19.770> um<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:21.150> think<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.409> stay<00:01:22.650> in<00:01:22.890> in<00:01:23.689> you

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
idea um I think that to stay in in you

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.100 
idea um I think that to stay in in you
know<00:01:24.720> southwest<00:01:25.680> London<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.100> obviously<00:01:26.549> the

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
know southwest London is obviously the

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.080 
know southwest London is obviously the
plan<00:01:28.110> but<00:01:28.680> at<00:01:29.189> this<00:01:29.340> moment<00:01:29.400> on<00:01:29.729> there<00:01:29.820> doesn't

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
plan but at this moment on there doesn't

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.660 
plan but at this moment on there doesn't
seem<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.240> be<00:01:30.360> any<00:01:30.950> room<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:31.979> build<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.400> new<00:01:32.520> one

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
seem to be any room to build a new one

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.890 
seem to be any room to build a new one
so<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:32.970> looks<00:01:33.119> like<00:01:33.150> build<00:01:33.450> in<00:01:33.570> stamford

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
so it looks like build in stamford

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.980 
so it looks like build in stamford

thousand seat stadium the good thing of
it<00:01:53.009> chassis<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.700> we<00:01:53.850> are<00:01:53.939> not<00:01:54.090> like

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
it chassis is that we are not like

not<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.460> lot<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.700> chassis<00:02:03.149> fans<00:02:03.409> if<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.740> was

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
not a lot of chassis fans if it was

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.550 
not a lot of chassis fans if it was
moving<00:02:05.880> out<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.060> safe<00:02:06.390> West<00:02:06.600> London<00:02:06.930> would<00:02:07.380> you

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
moving out a safe West London would you

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.859 
moving out a safe West London would you
be<00:02:07.740> completely<00:02:08.489> dead<00:02:08.700> set<00:02:08.910> against<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.360> like<00:02:09.720> if

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
be completely dead set against a like if

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.900 
be completely dead set against a like if
it<00:02:09.989> was<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.259> move<00:02:10.410> somewhere<00:02:10.709> I<00:02:11.039> have<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.760> pee

it was to move somewhere I have to pee
of<00:02:12.150> that<00:02:12.420> area

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
of that area

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.230 
of that area
would<00:02:13.890> you<00:02:14.070> not<00:02:14.310> want<00:02:14.550> it<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.760> happen<00:02:14.850> for<00:02:15.120> me

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
would you not want it to happen for me

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
be in a bigger stadium so would become a

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.100 
be in a bigger stadium so would become a
bigger<00:02:19.020> club<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:19.850> we<00:02:20.850> look<00:02:20.970> at<00:02:21.090> Arsenal<00:02:21.600> you

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
bigger club and we look at Arsenal you

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.830 
bigger club and we look at Arsenal you
know<00:02:22.230> they<00:02:22.410> got<00:02:22.560> a<00:02:22.590> massive<00:02:22.830> stadium<00:02:23.340> now<00:02:23.840> city

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
know they got a massive stadium now city

know they got a massive stadium now city
got<00:02:25.080> a<00:02:25.110> bigger<00:02:25.290> city<00:02:25.530> bit<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:26.070> get<00:02:26.130> even<00:02:26.370> bigger

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
got a bigger city bit to get even bigger

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.570 
got a bigger city bit to get even bigger
unite<00:02:27.360> got<00:02:27.600> a<00:02:27.630> big<00:02:27.810> stadium<00:02:28.190> you<00:02:29.190> know<00:02:29.310> and

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
unite got a big stadium you know and

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.510 
unite got a big stadium you know and
it's<00:02:30.450> only<00:02:30.570> us<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:31.200> Liverpool<00:02:32.160> at<00:02:32.370> this

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
it's only us and Liverpool at this

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.370 
it's only us and Liverpool at this
moment<00:02:32.670> I'm<00:02:33.000> that<00:02:33.150> hasn't<00:02:33.480> really<00:02:33.840> done

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
moment I'm that hasn't really done

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.810 
moment I'm that hasn't really done
anything<00:02:34.440> different<00:02:35.130> Liverpool<00:02:35.520> things<00:02:35.700> in

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
anything different Liverpool things in

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.240 
anything different Liverpool things in
the<00:02:35.880> process<00:02:36.240> of<00:02:36.300> redeveloping<00:02:36.930> Anfield<00:02:37.440> so<00:02:38.220> I

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
the process of redeveloping Anfield so I

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.770 
the process of redeveloping Anfield so I
think<00:02:38.670> that<00:02:38.850> could<00:02:39.060> be<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.270> way<00:02:39.390> for<00:02:39.570> chassis

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
think that could be the way for chassis

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.420 
think that could be the way for chassis
to<00:02:40.020> go<00:02:40.170> I<00:02:40.380> think<00:02:40.620> they<00:02:40.770> have<00:02:40.800> to<00:02:41.070> get<00:02:41.220> plan

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
to go I think they have to get plan

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.860 
to go I think they have to get plan
information<00:02:41.460> from<00:02:42.090> what<00:02:42.240> i<00:02:42.270> read<00:02:42.480> an<00:02:42.690> article

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
information from what i read an article

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.780 
information from what i read an article
earlier<00:02:43.230> that<00:02:43.710> to<00:02:44.130> get<00:02:44.310> it<00:02:44.430> so<00:02:44.520> they<00:02:44.610> can

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
earlier that to get it so they can

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.280 
earlier that to get it so they can
rebuild<00:02:45.360> around<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:47.430> tube<00:02:47.700> system<00:02:48.290> but

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
rebuild around the the tube system but

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.860 
rebuild around the the tube system but
um<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:50.010> one<00:02:50.190> thing<00:02:50.340> I<00:02:50.460> know<00:02:50.520> for<00:02:50.610> sure<00:02:51.390> when<00:02:51.840> I

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
um the one thing I know for sure when I

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.750 
um the one thing I know for sure when I
go<00:02:52.080> on<00:02:52.110> watch<00:02:52.290> chassis<00:02:52.650> you<00:02:53.310> know<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.730> the

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
go on watch chassis you know the the

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.360 
go on watch chassis you know the the
tube<00:02:54.510> system<00:02:54.960> does<00:02:55.260> get<00:02:55.530> very<00:02:55.560> very<00:02:55.980> packed

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
tube system does get very very packed

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.820 
tube system does get very very packed
and<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.760> alleys<00:02:57.240> going<00:02:57.510> out<00:02:57.690> of<00:02:57.840> it<00:02:58.020> oh<00:02:58.200> really

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
and the alleys going out of it oh really

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.040 
and the alleys going out of it oh really
really<00:02:59.190> packed<00:02:59.430> they<00:02:59.730> if<00:03:00.480> they<00:03:00.660> are<00:03:00.780> going<00:03:00.930> to

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
really packed they if they are going to

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.690 
really packed they if they are going to
redevelop<00:03:01.590> they<00:03:01.680> have<00:03:01.830> to<00:03:01.980> rebuild<00:03:02.490> that

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
redevelop they have to rebuild that

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.410 
redevelop they have to rebuild that
whole<00:03:03.030> area<00:03:03.990> a<00:03:04.350> full<00:03:04.860> armor<00:03:05.100> from<00:03:05.670> Broadway<00:03:06.150> so

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
whole area a full armor from Broadway so

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.140 
whole area a full armor from Broadway so
I<00:03:06.450> I<00:03:07.020> think<00:03:07.740> that<00:03:07.890> it's<00:03:08.610> something<00:03:08.790> that<00:03:09.120> needs

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
I I think that it's something that needs

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.930 
I I think that it's something that needs
to<00:03:09.480> happen<00:03:09.570> I<00:03:10.020> want<00:03:10.410> to<00:03:10.560> happen<00:03:10.680> it<00:03:11.640> looks<00:03:11.850> like

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
to happen I want to happen it looks like

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.860 
to happen I want to happen it looks like
chatty<00:03:12.270> its<00:03:12.450> momentum<00:03:12.600> are<00:03:13.080> stuck<00:03:13.710> at<00:03:14.630> as<00:03:15.630> it

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
chatty its momentum are stuck at as it
