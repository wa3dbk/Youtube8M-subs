I'm<00:00:00.329> Erin<00:00:00.599> with<00:00:00.719> galfer<00:00:01.020> braking<00:00:01.290> systems<00:00:01.620> and

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829 
I'm Erin with galfer braking systems and

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:02.840 
I'm Erin with galfer braking systems and
today<00:00:02.070> we<00:00:02.310> are<00:00:02.340> going<00:00:02.520> to<00:00:02.610> do<00:00:02.730> a<00:00:02.760> little

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
today we are going to do a little

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:09.440 
today we are going to do a little
install<00:00:03.540> on<00:00:03.840> some<00:00:04.770> brake<00:00:04.950> rotors<00:00:07.610> so<00:00:08.610> what<00:00:09.330> we

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
install on some brake rotors so what we

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.810 
install on some brake rotors so what we
wanted<00:00:09.660> to<00:00:09.719> start<00:00:09.929> with<00:00:10.170> is<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:10.500> bear<00:00:11.010> wheel<00:00:11.250> no

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
wanted to start with is a bear wheel no

want to clean the OEM bolt because you

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.810 
want to clean the OEM bolt because you
will<00:00:25.590> be<00:00:25.619> reusing<00:00:26.160> those<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.460> want<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.699> take

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
will be reusing those you want to take

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.640 
will be reusing those you want to take
those<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.359> loctite<00:00:27.869> that<00:00:28.019> comes<00:00:28.170> stock<00:00:28.470> on

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
those the loctite that comes stock on

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.769 
those the loctite that comes stock on
those<00:00:28.800> off<00:00:28.980> normal<00:00:29.910> wire<00:00:30.090> brush<00:00:30.420> will<00:00:30.630> work

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
those off normal wire brush will work

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.950 
those off normal wire brush will work
for<00:00:30.990> that<00:00:31.940> as<00:00:32.940> you<00:00:33.090> can<00:00:33.210> see<00:00:33.360> we<00:00:33.510> already<00:00:33.809> do

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
for that as you can see we already do

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.440 
for that as you can see we already do
have<00:00:34.140> one<00:00:34.380> rotor<00:00:34.649> on<00:00:34.890> on<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:36.000> back<00:00:36.149> side<00:00:36.390> here

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
have one rotor on on the back side here

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.720 
have one rotor on on the back side here
to<00:00:37.260> show<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.649> how<00:00:37.950> we're<00:00:38.160> going<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.309> do<00:00:38.489> the

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
to show you how we're going to do the

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.490 
to show you how we're going to do the
offset<00:00:39.239> with<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.690> other<00:00:39.840> side<00:00:40.079> we<00:00:40.260> want<00:00:40.440> to

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
offset with the other side we want to

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.500 
offset with the other side we want to
make<00:00:40.620> sure<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.790> rotors<00:00:42.090> are<00:00:42.210> offset

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
make sure that the rotors are offset

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.790 
make sure that the rotors are offset
from<00:00:42.540> side<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:42.989> side<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.320> what<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.590> does<00:00:43.739> is

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
from side to side and what that does is

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.010 
from side to side and what that does is
because<00:00:44.219> you're<00:00:44.820> going<00:00:45.090> from<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.420> round<00:00:45.750> rotor

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
because you're going from a round rotor

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.209 
because you're going from a round rotor
to<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.320> wave<00:00:46.559> rotor<00:00:46.770> there's<00:00:47.010> going<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.190> be

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
to a wave rotor there's going to be

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.619 
to a wave rotor there's going to be
different<00:00:47.399> characteristics<00:00:48.149> between<00:00:48.300> the

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
different characteristics between the

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.180 
different characteristics between the
two<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:48.989> we<00:00:49.469> want<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.710> make<00:00:49.829> sure<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:49.980> the

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
two and we want to make sure that the

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.740 
two and we want to make sure that the
wave<00:00:50.340> pattern<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:50.820> offset<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:51.600> don't

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
wave pattern is offset so that you don't

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.330 
wave pattern is offset so that you don't
have<00:00:51.809> any<00:00:51.989> type<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.199> vibration<00:00:52.829> once<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.160> put

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
have any type of vibration once you put

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.779 
have any type of vibration once you put
the<00:00:53.370> rotors<00:00:53.730> on<00:00:55.340> so<00:00:56.340> we're<00:00:56.460> going<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.640> lay<00:00:56.760> it

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
the rotors on so we're going to lay it

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.000 
the rotors on so we're going to lay it
down<00:00:57.140> you've<00:00:58.140> got<00:00:58.350> your<00:00:58.500> rotor<00:00:58.739> now<00:00:58.949> the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
down you've got your rotor now the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.220 
down you've got your rotor now the
rotors<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.670> we're<00:00:59.789> using<00:00:59.969> today<00:01:00.329> are<00:01:00.539> our

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
rotors that we're using today are our

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.290 
rotors that we're using today are our
Superbike<00:01:01.770> rotors<00:01:02.129> so<00:01:02.489> they<00:01:02.609> are<00:01:02.730> directional

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
Superbike rotors so they are directional

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.719 
Superbike rotors so they are directional
if<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.080> have<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.350> standard<00:01:04.739> set<00:01:05.040> it's<00:01:05.519> not

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
if you have the standard set it's not

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.250 
if you have the standard set it's not
going<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.909> matter<00:01:06.030> which<00:01:06.360> side<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:06.990> put<00:01:07.140> on

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
going to matter which side you put on

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.719 
going to matter which side you put on
first<00:01:07.500> left<00:01:07.770> or<00:01:07.950> right<00:01:08.100> there<00:01:08.490> because

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
first left or right there because

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.760 
first left or right there because
there's<00:01:09.000> no<00:01:09.150> direction<00:01:09.570> but<00:01:10.260> with<00:01:10.470> this<00:01:10.560> one

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
there's no direction but with this one

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.160 
there's no direction but with this one
we<00:01:10.920> already<00:01:11.070> have<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.790> right<00:01:12.720> side<00:01:12.960> road

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
we already have the right side road

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.179 
we already have the right side road
around<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:13.560> right<00:01:13.740> now<00:01:13.770> we're<00:01:13.950> going<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.100> put

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
around so right now we're going to put

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.840 
around so right now we're going to put
the<00:01:14.369> left<00:01:14.549> side<00:01:14.729> on<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:16.430> Superbike<00:01:17.430> rotors<00:01:17.729> do

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
the left side on the Superbike rotors do

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.280 
the left side on the Superbike rotors do
have<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.030> directional<00:01:18.570> arrow<00:01:18.720> on<00:01:18.960> them<00:01:19.140> so

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
have a directional arrow on them so

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.330 
have a directional arrow on them so
you'll<00:01:19.409> be<00:01:19.500> able<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.680> tell<00:01:19.860> them<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.040> that

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
you'll be able to tell them that that

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.530 
you'll be able to tell them that that
arrow<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.759> going<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:20.970> be<00:01:21.060> going<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:21.420> the

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
arrow is going to be going in the

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.730 
arrow is going to be going in the
direction<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.200> wheel<00:01:22.380> will<00:01:22.560> be

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
direction that the wheel will be

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.719 
direction that the wheel will be
spinning<00:01:25.040> so<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.100> want<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.369> line<00:01:26.520> up<00:01:26.700> your

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
spinning so you want to line up your

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.450 
spinning so you want to line up your
holes<00:01:27.030> now<00:01:27.750> when<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:27.930> say<00:01:28.140> offset<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:29.220> want<00:01:29.400> to

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
holes now when I say offset you want to

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.270 
holes now when I say offset you want to
make<00:01:29.579> sure<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.090> outside<00:01:30.479> wave<00:01:30.720> pattern

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
make sure that the outside wave pattern

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.800 
make sure that the outside wave pattern
from<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.640> right<00:01:32.820> side<00:01:33.000> row<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.450> left<00:01:33.630> side

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.600 
from the right side row to the left side
rotor<00:01:34.079> if<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.710> can<00:01:34.950> make<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:35.549> the

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
rotor if you can make it so that the

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.640 
rotor if you can make it so that the
peak<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.150> rotor<00:01:36.360> on<00:01:36.840> both<00:01:37.079> sides<00:01:37.380> is

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
peak of the rotor on both sides is

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.340 
peak of the rotor on both sides is
offset<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:38.490> say<00:01:38.970> this<00:01:39.240> is<00:01:39.390> your<00:01:39.630> your<00:01:40.110> left

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
offset so say this is your your left

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.899 
offset so say this is your your left
side<00:01:40.560> on<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.860> right<00:01:41.070> side<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.310> want<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.700> peak

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
side on the right side you want the peak

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.999 
side on the right side you want the peak

middle<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.280> this<00:01:44.430> trough<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.930> if<00:01:46.049> that's

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
middle of this trough so and if that's

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.440 
middle of this trough so and if that's
possible<00:01:46.439> awesome<00:01:47.310> if<00:01:47.460> not<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.119> want<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.329> make

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
possible awesome if not you want to make

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.389 
possible awesome if not you want to make
sure<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.200> carrier<00:01:49.500> section<00:01:49.979> that

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
sure that the the carrier section that

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.039 
sure that the the carrier section that
from<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.240> left<00:01:51.420> sides<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.750> right<00:01:51.869> side

from the left sides of the right side
that<00:01:52.200> if<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.470> carrier<00:01:52.710> lines<00:01:53.490> up<00:01:53.640> in<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.909> in

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
that if the carrier lines up in the in

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.480 
that if the carrier lines up in the in
the<00:01:54.119> center<00:01:54.479> here<00:01:54.689> so<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.770> your<00:01:55.950> offset<00:01:56.310> one

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
the center here so that your offset one

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.390 
the center here so that your offset one
way<00:01:56.640> or<00:01:56.700> another<00:01:56.909> install<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.020> new<00:01:58.140> rotor

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.440 

now<00:02:03.400> when<00:02:03.550> you're<00:02:03.670> taking<00:02:03.910> them<00:02:04.000> down<00:02:04.150> you<00:02:04.330> do

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
now when you're taking them down you do

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.150 
now when you're taking them down you do
want<00:02:04.630> to<00:02:04.720> use<00:02:04.900> a<00:02:04.930> you<00:02:05.410> know<00:02:05.470> similar<00:02:05.830> pattern

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
want to use a you know similar pattern

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.160 
want to use a you know similar pattern
to<00:02:06.190> when<00:02:06.430> you're<00:02:06.550> you<00:02:07.390> know<00:02:07.480> removing<00:02:07.990> or

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
to when you're you know removing or

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.870 
to when you're you know removing or
putting<00:02:08.710> your<00:02:08.890> wheel<00:02:09.040> back<00:02:09.250> on<00:02:09.280> your<00:02:09.550> car<00:02:09.729> and

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
putting your wheel back on your car and

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.400 
putting your wheel back on your car and
and<00:02:10.360> use<00:02:11.230> a<00:02:11.260> you<00:02:11.770> know<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:12.010> star<00:02:12.220> type<00:02:12.490> pattern

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
and use a you know the star type pattern

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.500 
and use a you know the star type pattern
so<00:02:14.880> we're<00:02:15.880> just<00:02:15.910> going<00:02:16.090> to<00:02:16.150> torque<00:02:16.390> them<00:02:16.480> down

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
so we're just going to torque them down

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:17.820 
so we're just going to torque them down
a<00:02:16.630> little<00:02:16.720> bit<00:02:16.990> to<00:02:17.140> begin<00:02:17.410> with<00:02:17.590> and<00:02:17.770> then

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
a little bit to begin with and then

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.120 
a little bit to begin with and then
we'll<00:02:18.070> we'll<00:02:18.640> use<00:02:18.880> the<00:02:19.230> OEM<00:02:20.230> spec<00:02:20.620> from<00:02:20.980> then

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
we'll we'll use the OEM spec from then

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:29.880 
we'll we'll use the OEM spec from then
on<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:27.340> so<00:02:27.670> we've<00:02:28.510> got<00:02:28.720> the<00:02:28.900> second<00:02:29.740> rotor

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
on and so we've got the second rotor

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.300 
on and so we've got the second rotor
installed<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:31.750> you<00:02:31.840> can<00:02:31.960> see<00:02:32.140> that<00:02:32.380> the<00:02:33.160> wave

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
installed and you can see that the wave

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.520 
installed and you can see that the wave
pattern<00:02:33.700> itself<00:02:33.970> is<00:02:34.210> is<00:02:34.630> slightly<00:02:34.930> off<00:02:35.230> but

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
pattern itself is is slightly off but

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.160 
pattern itself is is slightly off but
the<00:02:36.010> center<00:02:36.310> section<00:02:36.520> the<00:02:36.760> carrier<00:02:37.090> is<00:02:37.300> is

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
the center section the carrier is is

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.870 
the center section the carrier is is
offset<00:02:38.650> from<00:02:38.680> one<00:02:39.070> side<00:02:39.280> to<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.460> other<00:02:39.580> side

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
offset from one side to the other side

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.020 
offset from one side to the other side
and<00:02:40.180> that's<00:02:41.050> again<00:02:41.620> is<00:02:41.800> to<00:02:42.070> minimize<00:02:42.880> the

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
and that's again is to minimize the

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.160 
and that's again is to minimize the
amount<00:02:43.150> of<00:02:43.270> vibration<00:02:43.630> that<00:02:43.840> you're<00:02:43.990> going<00:02:44.110> to

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
amount of vibration that you're going to

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.020 
amount of vibration that you're going to
feel<00:02:44.350> from<00:02:44.620> actual<00:02:44.950> pattern<00:02:45.250> itself<00:02:45.700> on<00:02:45.940> the

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
feel from actual pattern itself on the

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.090 
feel from actual pattern itself on the
brake<00:02:46.240> pads<00:02:46.480> another<00:02:47.200> step<00:02:47.500> when<00:02:47.740> doing<00:02:48.010> an

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
brake pads another step when doing an

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.290 
brake pads another step when doing an
install<00:02:48.520> you<00:02:48.730> want<00:02:48.880> to<00:02:48.940> make<00:02:49.030> sure<00:02:49.060> that

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
install you want to make sure that

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.060 
install you want to make sure that
they're<00:02:49.420> offset<00:02:49.840> you<00:02:50.290> do<00:02:50.440> want<00:02:50.620> to<00:02:50.709> have<00:02:50.890> the

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
they're offset you do want to have the

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.100 
they're offset you do want to have the
wheel<00:02:51.310> rebalance<00:02:51.970> most<00:02:52.209> the<00:02:52.330> times<00:02:52.540> you<00:02:53.020> know

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
wheel rebalance most the times you know

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.960 
wheel rebalance most the times you know
guys<00:02:53.530> will<00:02:53.709> change<00:02:53.980> their<00:02:54.160> tires<00:02:54.400> at<00:02:54.700> the<00:02:54.790> same

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
guys will change their tires at the same

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.699 
guys will change their tires at the same
time<00:02:55.150> when<00:02:55.330> they're<00:02:55.450> doing<00:02:55.660> this<00:02:55.750> install<00:02:56.140> so

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
time when they're doing this install so

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.890 
time when they're doing this install so
it's<00:02:57.040> always<00:02:57.459> a<00:02:57.490> perfect<00:02:57.850> time<00:02:58.030> to<00:02:58.510> have<00:02:58.540> the

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
it's always a perfect time to have the

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.370 
it's always a perfect time to have the
wheel<00:02:59.050> rebalanced

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
wheel rebalanced

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.710 
wheel rebalanced
okay<00:03:02.130> so<00:03:02.190> now<00:03:02.730> we<00:03:02.790> have<00:03:02.880> our<00:03:03.030> rotor<00:03:03.390> torque

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
okay so now we have our rotor torque

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.830 
okay so now we have our rotor torque
down<00:03:03.870> to<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.200> OEM<00:03:04.500> specifications<00:03:05.690> we<00:03:06.690> are

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
down to the OEM specifications we are

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.210 
down to the OEM specifications we are
we're<00:03:07.110> going<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:07.320> go<00:03:07.440> throw<00:03:07.680> it<00:03:07.800> on<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:08.040> bike

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
we're going to go throw it on the bike

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.970 
we're going to go throw it on the bike
we<00:03:09.000> do<00:03:09.120> recommend<00:03:09.420> it<00:03:09.690> you<00:03:10.410> put<00:03:10.590> a<00:03:10.620> new<00:03:10.770> brick

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
we do recommend it you put a new brick

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.040 
we do recommend it you put a new brick
new<00:03:11.280> set<00:03:11.460> of<00:03:11.580> brake<00:03:11.730> pads<00:03:11.970> in<00:03:12.150> whenever<00:03:12.780> you're
