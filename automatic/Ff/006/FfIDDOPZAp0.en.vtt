00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.420 
got this for Christmas this year um I've
been<00:00:30.599> using<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.109> play<00:00:31.289> my<00:00:31.410> xbox<00:00:31.439> 360<00:00:32.250> games

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
been using it to play my xbox 360 games

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.620 
been using it to play my xbox 360 games
since<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:33.950> I've<00:00:34.950> had<00:00:35.280> no<00:00:35.579> troubles<00:00:36.030> with<00:00:36.450> it

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
since and I've had no troubles with it

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.200 
since and I've had no troubles with it
since<00:00:37.309> right<00:00:38.309> off<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.610> bat<00:00:38.760> looks<00:00:39.059> like<00:00:39.180> a

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
since right off the bat looks like a

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.940 
since right off the bat looks like a
normal<00:00:39.450> Xbox<00:00:40.050> 360<00:00:40.860> controller<00:00:41.280> we<00:00:42.149> have<00:00:42.180> the

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
normal Xbox 360 controller we have the

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.580 
normal Xbox 360 controller we have the
ABXY<00:00:43.950> buttons<00:00:44.390> same<00:00:45.390> color<00:00:45.680> about<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.890> same

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
ABXY buttons same color about the same

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.150 
ABXY buttons same color about the same
clicking<00:00:49.590> effects<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.610> normal<00:00:51.030> and

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
clicking effects this is normal and

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.889 
clicking effects this is normal and
although<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.370> do<00:00:53.579> really<00:00:54.030> like<00:00:54.239> about<00:00:54.390> this<00:00:54.660> is

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
although I do really like about this is

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.389 
although I do really like about this is
the<00:00:56.149> extra<00:00:57.149> sensitivity<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:58.199> guess<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.649> adds<00:00:58.829> to

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
the extra sensitivity I guess it adds to

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.100 
the extra sensitivity I guess it adds to
the<00:00:59.520> controller<00:01:00.379> that<00:01:02.300> I<00:01:03.300> believe<00:01:03.719> helps<00:01:04.019> a

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
the controller that I believe helps a

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.469 
the controller that I believe helps a
lot<00:01:04.229> with<00:01:04.559> call<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.220> duty<00:01:05.489> especially<00:01:06.590> um<00:01:08.479> yeah

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
lot with call of duty especially um yeah

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.039 
lot with call of duty especially um yeah
main<00:01:10.220> pretty<00:01:11.220> much<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.460> main<00:01:11.610> feature<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.720> it

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
main pretty much the main feature is it

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.469 
main pretty much the main feature is it

controller there's a black one for a

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.590 
controller there's a black one for a
better<00:01:33.060> comparison<00:01:34.130> they<00:01:35.130> are<00:01:35.600> the<00:01:36.600> same<00:01:37.100> size
