also got the Cooper's survey so if you

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.380 
also got the Cooper's survey so if you
using<00:00:30.510> monthly<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.500> single<00:00:31.890> think<00:00:32.489> it<00:00:32.730> also

using monthly the single think it also

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.319 
using monthly the single think it also
provides<00:00:33.870> you<00:00:34.050> with<00:00:34.260> some<00:00:34.530> beer<00:00:34.860> enhancer

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.400 

okay<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.390> start<00:00:39.690> with<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:39.899> need<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.170> sterilize

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
okay to start with you need to sterilize

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.590 
okay to start with you need to sterilize
out<00:00:40.860> all<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.070> our<00:00:41.280> equipment<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:42.239> reason<00:00:42.510> we

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
out all of our equipment the reason we

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.350 
out all of our equipment the reason we
do<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.809> is<00:00:43.520> like<00:00:44.520> anything<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.000> do<00:00:45.090> with<00:00:45.210> food

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
do that is like anything to do with food

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.270 
do that is like anything to do with food
production<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:46.230> wouldn't<00:00:46.710> make<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:46.950> meal

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
production you wouldn't make a meal

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.190 
production you wouldn't make a meal
without<00:00:47.850> cleaning<00:00:48.270> your<00:00:48.450> work<00:00:48.629> surface<00:00:48.899> and

without cleaning your work surface and
your<00:00:49.350> implements<00:00:49.800> down<00:00:49.980> first<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.460> all<00:00:50.610> and

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
your implements down first of all and

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.270 
your implements down first of all and
that's<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.449> same<00:00:51.660> we<00:00:51.809> brewing<00:00:52.129> the<00:00:53.129> only

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
that's the same we brewing the only

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.740 
that's the same we brewing the only
thing<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:54.030> have<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.180> go<00:00:54.360> on<00:00:54.539> stage

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
thing is that you have to go on stage

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.540 
thing is that you have to go on stage
further<00:00:55.050> anything<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:55.890> comes<00:00:56.010> into<00:00:56.250> contact

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
further anything that comes into contact

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.150 
further anything that comes into contact
with<00:00:57.350> with<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.440> liquid<00:00:58.590> that's<00:00:58.859> going<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.100> be

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
with with the liquid that's going to be

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.860 
with with the liquid that's going to be
fermented<00:00:59.430> or<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.270> equipment<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:00.750> it's

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
fermented or the equipment that it's

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.920 
fermented or the equipment that it's
going<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.050> be<00:01:01.140> fermented<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.710> needs<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.609> be

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
going to be fermented it needs to be

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.090 
going to be fermented it needs to be
completely<00:01:03.930> sterilized<00:01:04.530> therefore<00:01:04.979> all

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
completely sterilized therefore all

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.310 
completely sterilized therefore all
bacteria<00:01:05.610> has<00:01:05.700> been<00:01:05.880> killed<00:01:06.119> off<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.600> reason

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
bacteria has been killed off the reason

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.810 
bacteria has been killed off the reason
for<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.920> yeast<00:01:08.130> needs<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.700> be

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
for that is that the yeast needs to be

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.090 
for that is that the yeast needs to be
able<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.180> grow<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.900> needs<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.200> be<00:01:10.320> able<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.650> turn

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
able to grow it needs to be able to turn

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.030 
able to grow it needs to be able to turn
the<00:01:11.430> sweet<00:01:12.210> sugars<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:12.810> exist<00:01:13.200> in<00:01:13.380> the

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
the sweet sugars that exist in the

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.120 
the sweet sugars that exist in the
liquid<00:01:14.240> into<00:01:15.240> alcohol<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.259> if<00:01:16.799> it's<00:01:16.920> going<00:01:17.070> to

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
liquid into alcohol and if it's going to

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.070 
liquid into alcohol and if it's going to
compete<00:01:17.400> with<00:01:17.580> any<00:01:17.700> other<00:01:17.850> bacteria<00:01:18.540> then<00:01:18.720> the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
compete with any other bacteria then the

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.929 
compete with any other bacteria then the
chance<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.500> doing<00:01:19.830> that<00:01:19.950> are<00:01:20.220> or<00:01:20.460> reduce

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
chance of you doing that are or reduce

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.609 
chance of you doing that are or reduce
significantly<00:01:21.200> the<00:01:22.200> other<00:01:22.350> thing<00:01:22.500> is<00:01:22.530> that

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
significantly the other thing is that

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.679 
significantly the other thing is that
bacteria<00:01:23.220> can<00:01:23.400> introduce<00:01:23.640> off<00:01:23.970> flavors<00:01:24.540> and

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
bacteria can introduce off flavors and

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.800 
bacteria can introduce off flavors and
off<00:01:24.750> off<00:01:25.049> off<00:01:25.850> for<00:01:26.850> Roma's<00:01:27.210> into<00:01:27.509> your<00:01:27.630> beer

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
off off off for Roma's into your beer

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.690 
off off off for Roma's into your beer
and<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.290> can<00:01:28.409> also<00:01:28.530> get<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.799> spoiled<00:01:29.250> beer<00:01:29.400> or

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
and you can also get a spoiled beer or

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.760 
and you can also get a spoiled beer or
beer<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:30.119> won't<00:01:30.299> ferment<00:01:30.509> whatsoever<00:01:31.229> so

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
beer that won't ferment whatsoever so

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.920 
beer that won't ferment whatsoever so
it's<00:01:32.640> not<00:01:32.820> rocket<00:01:33.030> science<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.479> just<00:01:33.689> needs<00:01:33.869> to

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
it's not rocket science it just needs to

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.420 
it's not rocket science it just needs to
be<00:01:34.020> done<00:01:34.259> needs<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.650> be<00:01:34.770> done<00:01:34.890> well<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.280> make

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
be done needs to be done well and make

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.609 
be done needs to be done well and make
sure<00:01:35.460> we've<00:01:35.909> completely<00:01:36.270> sterilized<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:37.079> to

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
sure we've completely sterilized it to

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.660 
sure we've completely sterilized it to
do<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:38.060> we<00:01:39.060> use<00:01:39.210> our<00:01:39.360> sterilizer<00:01:39.900> here<00:01:40.229> and

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
do that we use our sterilizer here and

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.219 
do that we use our sterilizer here and
Ygritte<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.909> switches<00:01:42.420> here<00:01:42.600> say<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:43.110> we

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
Ygritte the switches here say that we

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.609 
Ygritte the switches here say that we

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
start and one what's sterilizing as we

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.160 
start and one what's sterilizing as we
put<00:04:40.390> both<00:04:40.570> cans<00:04:40.930> into<00:04:41.740> hot<00:04:42.040> water<00:04:42.070> or<00:04:43.080> even<00:04:44.080> do

that is within the inside the cans

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.740 
that is within the inside the cans
there's<00:04:46.060> quite<00:04:46.630> a<00:04:46.660> thick<00:04:47.070> what's<00:04:48.070> called<00:04:48.310> word

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
there's quite a thick what's called word

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.610 
there's quite a thick what's called word
and<00:04:49.750> that's<00:04:49.960> the<00:04:50.020> thing<00:04:50.140> that<00:04:50.230> we're<00:04:50.410> going<00:04:50.530> to

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
and that's the thing that we're going to

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.500 
and that's the thing that we're going to
ferment<00:04:50.980> and<00:04:51.250> because<00:04:51.760> it's<00:04:52.150> very<00:04:52.270> much<00:04:52.420> like

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
ferment and because it's very much like

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.870 
ferment and because it's very much like
a<00:04:52.660> honey<00:04:52.990> or<00:04:53.170> syrup<00:04:53.500> we<00:04:53.740> just<00:04:53.920> need<00:04:54.070> to<00:04:54.220> raise

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
a honey or syrup we just need to raise

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.700 
a honey or syrup we just need to raise
the<00:04:55.090> temperature<00:04:55.420> of<00:04:55.660> that<00:04:55.960> to<00:04:56.380> make<00:04:56.560> that

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
the temperature of that to make that

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.800 
the temperature of that to make that
easier<00:04:57.070> to<00:04:57.130> pour<00:04:57.430> so<00:04:58.120> we'll<00:04:58.270> just<00:04:58.300> pop<00:04:58.780> that

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
easier to pour so we'll just pop that

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.980 
easier to pour so we'll just pop that
into<00:04:59.080> the<00:04:59.290> sink<00:04:59.530> into<00:04:59.740> hot<00:05:00.010> water<00:05:00.270> and<00:05:01.270> we'll

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
into the sink into hot water and we'll

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.230 
into the sink into hot water and we'll
leave<00:05:02.140> that<00:05:02.170> for<00:05:02.440> a<00:05:03.070> few<00:05:03.220> minutes<00:05:03.490> after<00:05:03.940> three

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
leave that for a few minutes after three

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.820 
leave that for a few minutes after three
minutes<00:05:04.390> if<00:05:04.750> you<00:05:04.840> sing<00:05:05.050> something<00:05:05.410> I'll<00:05:05.680> just

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
minutes if you sing something I'll just

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.280 
minutes if you sing something I'll just
turn<00:05:05.980> the<00:05:06.160> cans<00:05:06.370> upside<00:05:06.730> down<00:05:07.000> and<00:05:07.900> also<00:05:08.170> we'll

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
turn the cans upside down and also we'll

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.080 
turn the cans upside down and also we'll
get<00:05:08.380> the<00:05:08.470> heat<00:05:08.620> through<00:05:08.890> and<00:05:09.040> that<00:05:09.100> will<00:05:09.340> pull

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
get the heat through and that will pull

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.570 
get the heat through and that will pull
finished<00:05:10.450> out<00:05:13.440> ok<00:05:14.440> so<00:05:14.500> our<00:05:14.710> cans<00:05:15.070> have<00:05:15.310> been<00:05:15.340> in

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
finished out ok so our cans have been in

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:16.890 
finished out ok so our cans have been in
the<00:05:15.640> hot<00:05:15.760> water<00:05:15.910> for<00:05:16.210> six<00:05:16.420> minutes<00:05:16.630> you're

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
the hot water for six minutes you're

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.110
