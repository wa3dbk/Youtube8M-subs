quick<00:00:04.589> build<00:00:04.830> the<00:00:05.130> winner<00:00:05.430> from<00:00:05.670> the<00:00:05.730> voting

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
quick build the winner from the voting

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.490 
quick build the winner from the voting
from<00:00:06.240> the<00:00:06.299> last<00:00:06.480> quick<00:00:06.720> build<00:00:06.899> was<00:00:07.140> actually

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
from the last quick build was actually

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.530 
from the last quick build was actually
in<00:00:07.740> fact<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:08.189> tie<00:00:08.429> for<00:00:08.790> three<00:00:09.000> of<00:00:09.030> them<00:00:09.210> so<00:00:09.510> I

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
in fact a tie for three of them so I

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.150 
in fact a tie for three of them so I
went<00:00:09.780> ahead<00:00:09.870> and<00:00:10.110> picked<00:00:10.349> one<00:00:10.650> of<00:00:10.769> them<00:00:10.950> and

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
went ahead and picked one of them and

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.430 
went ahead and picked one of them and
that's<00:00:11.940> because<00:00:12.120> our<00:00:12.719> got<00:00:12.900> will<00:00:13.110> probably

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
that's because our got will probably

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.890 
that's because our got will probably
never<00:00:13.590> get<00:00:13.830> voted<00:00:14.130> for<00:00:14.280> again<00:00:14.429> now<00:00:14.610> so<00:00:15.179> that's

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
never get voted for again now so that's

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.300 
never get voted for again now so that's
who<00:00:16.049> it<00:00:16.199> is<00:00:16.350> go<00:00:16.650> ahead<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:16.980> leave<00:00:17.100> me<00:00:17.279> a

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
we'll go on with our God's quick build

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.229 
we'll go on with our God's quick build
for<00:00:34.590> our<00:00:34.620> gots<00:00:34.950> abilities<00:00:35.550> at<00:00:35.820> level<00:00:36.090> one<00:00:36.210> I

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
for our gots abilities at level one I

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.290 
for our gots abilities at level one I
put<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.480> point<00:00:36.809> into<00:00:37.440> his<00:00:38.100> Q<00:00:38.520> ability<00:00:38.940> which<00:00:39.120> is

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
put a point into his Q ability which is

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.229 
put a point into his Q ability which is
acid<00:00:39.780> hunter<00:00:40.379> at<00:00:40.649> level<00:00:41.550> two<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:41.700> typically<00:00:42.120> put

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
acid hunter at level two I typically put

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.260 
acid hunter at level two I typically put
a<00:00:42.300> point<00:00:42.570> into<00:00:42.930> my<00:00:43.170> noxian<00:00:44.070> corrosive<00:00:44.730> charge

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
a point into my noxian corrosive charge

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.690 
a point into my noxian corrosive charge
and<00:00:45.629> I'll<00:00:45.750> typically<00:00:46.320> maxes<00:00:46.950> out<00:00:47.070> second

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
and I'll typically maxes out second

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.000 
and I'll typically maxes out second
because<00:00:48.239> it's<00:00:48.629> kind<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.140> strong<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.590> be<00:00:49.710> honest

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
because it's kind of strong to be honest

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.860 
because it's kind of strong to be honest
when<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.219> team<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.520> up<00:00:50.610> with<00:00:51.120> acid<00:00:51.449> hunter<00:00:51.660> if
