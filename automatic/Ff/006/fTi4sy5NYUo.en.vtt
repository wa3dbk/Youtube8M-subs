everything that was tuck underneath that

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.750 
everything that was tuck underneath that
knows<00:00:21.480> it's<00:00:21.990> pretty<00:00:22.260> impressive<00:00:22.800> cake

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760

hopefully<00:00:32.009> i<00:00:32.040> can<00:00:32.070> remember<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.489> put<00:00:32.640> all<00:00:32.759> that

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
hopefully i can remember to put all that

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.880 
hopefully i can remember to put all that
back<00:00:33.090> together<00:00:33.450> or<00:00:33.930> i<00:00:33.960> might<00:00:34.260> change<00:00:34.530> it<00:00:34.680> up<00:00:34.770> a

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
back together or i might change it up a

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.970 
back together or i might change it up a
little<00:00:34.920> bit<00:00:36.050> this<00:00:37.050> is<00:00:37.760> the<00:00:38.760> nose<00:00:38.969> now<00:00:39.980> it's

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
little bit this is the nose now it's

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.680 
little bit this is the nose now it's
going<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.219> cut<00:00:41.610> back<00:00:41.790> by<00:00:42.000> an<00:00:42.149> inch<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.660> half

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
going to cut back by an inch and a half

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.520 
going to cut back by an inch and a half
more<00:00:43.110> right<00:00:43.590> at<00:00:43.739> this<00:00:43.890> area<00:00:44.129> here<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:45.530> it'll

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
more right at this area here and it'll

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.119 
more right at this area here and it'll
pick<00:00:46.800> up<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.129> roundness<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.700> VW<00:00:48.180> bus<00:00:48.500> all<00:00:49.500> this

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
pick up the roundness of VW bus all this

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.189 
pick up the roundness of VW bus all this
bumper<00:00:50.610> stuff<00:00:50.850> here<00:00:51.059> would<00:00:51.180> be<00:00:51.270> cut<00:00:51.510> off<00:00:51.690> and

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
bumper stuff here would be cut off and

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.459 
bumper stuff here would be cut off and
re-engineered<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.280> pushed<00:00:53.670> back<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.410> so<00:00:55.410> I

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
re-engineered and pushed back and so I

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.229 
re-engineered and pushed back and so I
can<00:00:55.680> feel<00:00:55.860> somewhat<00:00:56.399> safe<00:00:56.640> sitting<00:00:57.059> in<00:00:57.149> the

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
can feel somewhat safe sitting in the

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.660 
can feel somewhat safe sitting in the
crumple<00:00:57.570> zone<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:58.050> don't<00:00:58.739> think<00:00:58.829> this<00:00:59.100> will<00:00:59.489> go

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
crumple zone I don't think this will go

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.410 
crumple zone I don't think this will go
on<00:00:59.699> any<00:00:59.940> longer<00:01:00.030> knees<00:01:01.370> now<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.239> quite

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
on any longer knees now this is quite

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.170 
on any longer knees now this is quite
impressive<00:01:03.690> this<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:05.070> wiring<00:01:05.519> harness<00:01:05.880> up

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
impressive this is the wiring harness up

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.899 
impressive this is the wiring harness up
front<00:01:06.740> that's<00:01:07.740> about<00:01:08.010> two<00:01:08.250> inches<00:01:08.520> brown<00:01:08.820> and

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
front that's about two inches brown and

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.649 
front that's about two inches brown and
every<00:01:12.619> that<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:14.000> hunk<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.150> crap<00:01:15.360> right<00:01:15.420> there

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
every that is hunk of crap right there

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.660 
every that is hunk of crap right there
let<00:01:16.049> me<00:01:16.080> tell<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.790> luckily<00:01:17.790> every<00:01:18.150> switch<00:01:18.450> is

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
let me tell you luckily every switch is

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.770 
let me tell you luckily every switch is
shaped<00:01:20.670> differently<00:01:20.850> every<00:01:21.509> plug-in<00:01:22.729> so<00:01:23.780> the

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
shaped differently every plug-in so the

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.719 
shaped differently every plug-in so the
next<00:01:25.020> step<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:27.080> 202<00:01:28.080> rear<00:01:28.259> date<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:28.890> mean<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.490> may

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
next step is 202 rear date I mean I may

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.929 
next step is 202 rear date I mean I may
get<00:01:29.939> rid<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.180> all<00:01:30.329> this<00:01:30.509> stuff<00:01:30.570> may<00:01:31.049> go<00:01:31.229> with<00:01:31.380> a

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
get rid of all this stuff may go with a

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:34.429 
get rid of all this stuff may go with a
another<00:01:32.939> wiring<00:01:33.390> system<00:01:33.810> like<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:33.990> 3-wire

excuse<00:02:00.659> me<00:02:00.810> next<00:02:01.049> step<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:02.070> VW<00:02:02.759> bus<00:02:03.030> cut

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
excuse me next step is the VW bus cut

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.590 
excuse me next step is the VW bus cut
that<00:02:03.930> nose<00:02:04.320> off<00:02:04.590> it's<00:02:04.890> going<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.070> be<00:02:05.130> cut<00:02:05.600> right

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
that nose off it's going to be cut right

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:13.340 
that nose off it's going to be cut right
here<00:02:08.420> first<00:02:09.420> i'll<00:02:09.660> make<00:02:09.840> some<00:02:10.050> patterns<00:02:12.230> then

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
here first i'll make some patterns then

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.260 
here first i'll make some patterns then
go<00:02:13.470> ahead<00:02:13.650> and<00:02:13.800> keep<00:02:13.980> this<00:02:14.220> profile<00:02:14.790> from<00:02:15.090> the

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
go ahead and keep this profile from the

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.240 
go ahead and keep this profile from the
roof<00:02:15.450> over<00:02:15.810> so<00:02:15.990> when<00:02:16.140> I<00:02:16.170> fit<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:16.620> stays<00:02:16.920> pretty

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
roof over so when I fit it stays pretty

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.940 
roof over so when I fit it stays pretty
accurate<00:02:18.110> and<00:02:19.110> then<00:02:19.320> i'll<00:02:19.410> go<00:02:19.560> ahead<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:19.770> weld

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
accurate and then i'll go ahead and weld

metalwork and who knows what phase
that'll<00:02:49.650> be<00:02:50.600> I'm<00:02:51.600> also<00:02:51.690> thinking<00:02:52.020> about

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
that'll be I'm also thinking about

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.320 
that'll be I'm also thinking about
underneath<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.190> nose<00:02:53.370> here<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:53.820> lays<00:02:54.000> flat

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
underneath the nose here the lays flat

underneath the nose here the lays flat
that<00:02:54.900> is<00:02:54.960> the<00:02:55.730> AC<00:02:56.730> condenser<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:57.660> the

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
that is the AC condenser and the

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.300 
that is the AC condenser and the
radiator<00:02:58.440> sits<00:02:58.680> in<00:02:58.830> there<00:02:58.980> and<00:02:59.070> these<00:02:59.160> things

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
radiator sits in there and these things

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.300 
radiator sits in there and these things
are<00:02:59.460> known<00:02:59.640> to<00:02:59.790> overheat<00:03:00.270> I<00:03:00.830> may<00:03:01.830> go<00:03:02.010> ahead<00:03:02.160> and

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
are known to overheat I may go ahead and

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.250 
are known to overheat I may go ahead and
keep<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:03.740> engine<00:03:04.740> hump<00:03:05.040> over<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.540> like<00:03:07.140> the

system the condenser the radiator couple

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.780 
system the condenser the radiator couple
batteries<00:03:16.200> back<00:03:16.650> here<00:03:16.980> and<00:03:17.130> kind<00:03:17.370> of<00:03:17.490> get<00:03:17.640> some

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
batteries back here and kind of get some

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.390 
batteries back here and kind of get some
more<00:03:17.970> weight<00:03:18.120> back<00:03:18.390> here<00:03:19.010> that's<00:03:20.010> a<00:03:20.190> thought

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
more weight back here that's a thought

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.210 
more weight back here that's a thought
so<00:03:21.290> trying<00:03:22.290> to<00:03:22.380> think<00:03:22.650> about<00:03:22.860> that<00:03:23.010> too<00:03:23.190> much

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220
