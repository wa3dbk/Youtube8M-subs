the system works power switches here we

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:30.510 
the system works power switches here we
have<00:01:28.479> four<00:01:29.319> different<00:01:29.469> magnet<00:01:29.950> sensors<00:01:30.340> on

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
have four different magnet sensors on

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.249 
have four different magnet sensors on
this<00:01:30.700> so<00:01:30.969> that<00:01:31.179> it<00:01:31.390> can<00:01:31.539> tell<00:01:31.719> its<00:01:31.869> orientation

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
this so that it can tell its orientation

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.109 
this so that it can tell its orientation
and<00:01:32.530> speed<00:01:32.799> so<00:01:33.459> what<00:01:33.579> I'm<00:01:33.640> going<00:01:33.759> to<00:01:33.789> do<00:01:33.969> is

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
and speed so what I'm going to do is

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:35.580 
and speed so what I'm going to do is
just<00:01:34.270> whine<00:01:34.479> the<00:01:34.509> pedals<00:01:34.899> and<00:01:35.049> get<00:01:35.140> it<00:01:35.259> started

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
just whine the pedals and get it started

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.740 
just whine the pedals and get it started
you'll<00:01:35.799> see<00:01:36.069> that<00:01:36.340> some<00:01:37.119> of<00:01:37.149> the<00:01:37.270> LEDs<00:01:37.569> will

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
you'll see that some of the LEDs will

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.330 
you'll see that some of the LEDs will
