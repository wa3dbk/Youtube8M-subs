00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:13.950
 the two names alex and I bring you a 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:17.900
 small video demonstrate 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:21.029
 a new acquisition that is basically 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:25.880
 a magnifying glass or in quotes microscope 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.880
 there is a you for him by usb 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.309
 behind these accessories is actually a 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.720
 endoscope but good can serve us 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.230
 as endoscopies and what we want to use is 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:40.980
 where my main use will be for 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.830
 weld and be able to record videos about it 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:49.290
 besides things that you want as you can 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:50.850
 see in a small control where we 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.480
 allows you to take pictures and we are using the 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.720
 windows software or adjust the light of 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.460
 the letters 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.460
 they have a saddle 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:08.950
 and that you can regulate height this 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:12.250
 pretty simple way on moto2 drop 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.200
 here going up and down can take it out for 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.590
 use it or even even as good 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.590
 alderman 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:24.100
 how to vary the angle 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:29.250
 and we can also adjust the 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.250
 the rock is worth then but prove 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.729
 conjunctiva 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.360
 i 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.210
 Of course he is good at 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:49.130
 clear but good and I'll show you how 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:53.380
 see in the next videos see the 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.380
 next means on health but 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.560
 I think more or less an idea of 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.390
 for example the response speed 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.880
 which is pretty good when I have 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:09.950
 enough lighting if we remove the light 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.950
 is still one of the good 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:17.160
 well it's not so bad but because I have 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.160
 the light on top of the table 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.459
 now we are given but we are going to 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.390
 be pretty dark if I just 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.390
 I put the light on him 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:33.550
 the one that groups these 800 x 600 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.910
 but if you notice it is covering a 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.340
 1920 x 1200 talca full screen 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.920
 hd 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.170
 we go fluid reason in the 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.500
 big enough this way already 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.620
 you will see the video 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.180
 and you can stop up to 1,240 that is 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.400
 that looks even if we put in a fight 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.129
 little more 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.810
 let's say not completely fluid although it 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:58.760
 you can use for extension though 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.269
 I tell them 800 percent it also seems 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:05.810
 that looks very good and good also has 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:08.900
 cost 45 euros or something always which 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.310
 not bad for this kind of 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:16.290
 device if we want we can do 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:18.450
 they are very high but for example if 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.920
 we would like to do more are simply 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.920
 here we adjust the focus 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.820
 adjusted the focus 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.820
 and how to form 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.140
 the green terminals 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:39.880
 the integrated that if I'm not wrong will be 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:42.650
 a 3 464 or special course 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.900
 I would say 64 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.970
 but as you can see 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.800
 when this time the resistances everything 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:55.800
 it looks pretty good 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.800
 I'm going to do how many do 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.269
 maybe for me 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.170
 As you can see, this is much more 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:12.250
 Sun 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.250
 quite are 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.460
 all the big speakers 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.130
 enough to inspect things 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.600
 very very small 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.740
 for 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.740
 to climb a little 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:33.650
 where as those who do not have autofocus 

00:04:31.649 --> 00:04:36.470
 but good 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.210
 to adjust perfectly and we 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.510
 Normally welding will take away the 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.380
 autofocus 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:43.980
 that is, nothing 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.390
 good basically 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.940
 those that demonstrate that the 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:51.540
 approximately and if any 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:53.970
 Interested in buying it because they know that no 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:56.940
 it's bad price for what the 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:59.750
 truth is that it seems almost a good 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.760
 buy so no 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:05.080
 a little hand up greeting if 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.080
 authorities to press
