00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.490
 half-way, now we're going to teach you 

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:06.799
 how to decorate this rich cake for your 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.080
 Easter parties is fine 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.030
 simple and it is very nice what 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.040
 we are going to need for this is 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.250
 obviously a cake can be 12 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.650
 story depends on how we want 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.260
 to need this frosting is using the 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.660
 chocolate and a little bit of green aysÃ©n 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.960
 just for decoration we are going to also 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.480
 need some chocolates for esther and 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.360
 some pips in different colors these 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.670
 They are beautiful for him to hold a lot 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.180
 color and that you look very beautiful so 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.220
 we're going to need all this and the first thing 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.900
 what are we going to do, let's take our 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:47.989
 frosting and we go to bitumen and we're going to 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.450
 start decorating the cake to put the 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.790
 basis so that is apart from us 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.100
 serve to stick the pips nothing 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:58.579
 It's going to give you a very, very rich flavor 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.430
 that we are going to put everything around 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.260
 our cake also on the sides myself 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.220
 I'm being a little bit generous because 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.890
 I love how it is 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.110
 with pretty frosting so that's why 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.240
 I'm doing it like that but you 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.070
 You can add the amount you want 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.850
 depending on how much they like it or not 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:21.930
 or they could also use a bitumen of 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:24.270
 another flavor maybe vanilla or strawberry 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.150
 can play a lot with the flavors and 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.730
 it depends on how you like it so we're going 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.510
 to finish this and right now let's go to 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:35.400
 start putting them the pips I already 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.290
 arranged in the order that I wanted so 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.600
 nothing else I'm going to start hitting and that's why 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.570
 it's very important facsimiles are left 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.330
 there are very cute and apart if the 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.520
 we put juntitos in those white points 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.729
 that they are given there they stay stuck 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.130
 it's like they came in the package so 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.470
 helps a lot and covers the white part the 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.200
 most of the time and I'll finish 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.240
 of flipping my cake so that 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.090
 do not take us long and now what 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:07.140
 let's do let's pour we have them 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:11.190
 on top of the cake to cover all this 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.230
 of the bitumen that we put at the beginning and 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.920
 apart it will give a very very colorful 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.440
 cute my boy was super excited 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.180
 when he was doing it is a detail 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.060
 really cool so I hope that 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.030
 you also like it and let's go now 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.350
 what I'm going to do with ay singh or with 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.840
 the other bitumen that is 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.330
 to decorate and you already buy it and you 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.990
 you can do if you like and use a manga 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.210
 to decorate 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.250
 I'm going to put a little bit of zacatito in the 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.920
 bottom part just for the view the 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.800
 truth is not anything that is needed but 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.570
 gives you a nice view to the cake so 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.300
 which is why I'm doing it and 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.160
 nothing else I'm going to turn around here and 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.010
 probably also do it in the 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.860
 top part 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.629
 but that is totally optional the 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.310
 You really do not need it 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:01.319
 here they sell they are falling a little bit 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.450
 because I did not put in enough bitumen but 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.159
 nothing that can not be fixed nor I 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.459
 they could also put a ribbon on him 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:10.980
 around but it's if I like the truth 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.540
 I decided to leave it like that and it stayed a while 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.409
 until I put more bitumen there what 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:19.409
 fix a little bit and that's how very very 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:21.870
 cute the dough was very delicious 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:23.790
 well a little bit by mouth but it's 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.640
 very cute serves as for a center 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:30.659
 table could best put it together with 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:34.139
 other cakes and decorate your party what 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:36.480
 which would be very very nice and then to here 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:41.550
 it's like the cake was left 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:44.160

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:47.700
