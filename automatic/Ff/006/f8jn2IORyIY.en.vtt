00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.710
 and hello everyone i'm here for the fifth time 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:13.500
 I can't hear the video 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.650
 now can not hear well, so here you are 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.020
 I'll show you now 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:22.230
 really a problem as you will see 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.619
 I think you will see in the title I do not 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.660
 battlefield 3 part starts 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:31.099
 I don't know why he gives this one 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.739
 mistake see launching battlefield 3 and 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:36.899
 wait a couple of seconds and a year pops up 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.540
 here's how you see me here is such a mistake 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.950
 and dow files mapped programs for 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.320
 perform this action 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.480
 install the program or if it is already 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.660
 installed create mapped to 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.600
 help to planet control panel 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:55.879
 the program is what I have in my opinion yes I am already 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:59.670
 tried now I tried to do it 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:08.250
 look now i will make a bigger screen 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:23.970
 Well, let it be the screen open this folder 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:26.850
 and so here they are my parameters as I think 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.909
 you see the processor well, in short everything 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.280
 requirements fit it all right with me 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:37.470
 fits and how many did not check the air 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:40.619
 control panel and now I do not understand what 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:44.220
 It should be combined so I also desired program 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:47.759
 by default and here's the job of programs for 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.460
 default we wait for loading here it goes both 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.500
 and that's not to get tired of the program that 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.680
 what programs to do next 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:59.159
 match and this is the only one 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.530
 I do not understand what to compare this 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:06.590
 the program 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:17.180
 or is there some kind of program that's necessary 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:36.860
 for programs not opera compose or 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:49.040
 just not there well, so I think true 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:03:05.840
 I press right when you try something 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:03:13.959
 do here such here but I don't know 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:13.959
 what not to do i think i'll go in daddy 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:57.130
 I just will not be other videos 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:57.130
 until I open the window you write hno 3 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:13.519
 here it is my skype remember it it will be 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:16.729

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:21.190

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:33.860
 help link to my VKontakte 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:38.919

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.919
 you will write like this 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:58.750

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:58.750
 space and here you have the link itself 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:16.900

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.169

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:44.000
 I went to 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.840
 I think I'll pause for now 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:51.090
 to find 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:53.910
 so guys I have for some reason 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:59.160
 Internet does not load and can not understand why a 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:06:11.400
 more precisely why look when I go to 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:14.180
 Battle all this is some kind of crap so I 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:19.020
 don't even know what so clicked 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:24.539
 some was really oh well shorter 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:29.699
 on the internet when i have your site yourself 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:30.120
 battlefield when i started up came on 

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:33.169

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:36.330
 lay there came in all the accounts sorry 

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:40.800
 start playing there and he's shorter to me 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:43.590
 gave an error well, rather that there is a plugin 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:46.349
 Some kind of need there is something allowed there 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:48.300
 a plug-in on such and such a plug-in is not 

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:51.240
 It was and squeezed download now I tell you 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:54.479

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:58.580
 Now they have a file so he gave 

00:06:54.479 --> 00:07:02.190
 Battle Loch in plug-ins 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:05.479
 2.3.2 wand bottom 103 

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:09.150
 so I run it and see what 

00:07:05.479 --> 00:07:11.669
 it drops out automatically without permission 

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:14.240
 I'm starting to install some kind of crap 

00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:14.240
