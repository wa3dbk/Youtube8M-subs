Meditation practice notice the waves are
going<00:00:29.890> up<00:00:30.070> and<00:00:30.220> down<00:00:30.310> together<00:00:30.820> you<00:00:31.539> see<00:00:31.689> the

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:31.810 
going up and down together you see the

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.410 
going up and down together you see the
rising<00:00:32.320> and<00:00:32.470> falling<00:00:32.529> are<00:00:33.130> very<00:00:33.370> similar<00:00:33.640> this

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
rising and falling are very similar this

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.990 
rising and falling are very similar this
is<00:00:34.540> something<00:00:34.870> called<00:00:35.110> coherence<00:00:35.890> now<00:00:36.790> let's

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
is something called coherence now let's

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.510 
is something called coherence now let's
look<00:00:37.120> at<00:00:37.240> a<00:00:37.450> Ichi<00:00:37.810> in<00:00:37.930> real<00:00:38.140> time<00:00:38.470> what<00:00:39.370> we're

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
look at a Ichi in real time what we're

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.090 
look at a Ichi in real time what we're
seeing<00:00:39.760> is<00:00:40.090> da<00:00:40.420> rihanna's<00:00:40.870> EEG<00:00:41.470> from<00:00:41.770> the<00:00:41.890> two

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
seeing is da rihanna's EEG from the two

seeing is da rihanna's EEG from the two
frontal<00:00:42.700> leads<00:00:43.150> these<00:00:44.140> are<00:00:44.380> the<00:00:44.530> two<00:00:44.800> leads

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
frontal leads these are the two leads

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.820 
frontal leads these are the two leads
you<00:00:45.280> see<00:00:45.520> and<00:00:45.760> the<00:00:46.060> first<00:00:46.300> two<00:00:46.510> rows<00:00:46.830> the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:47.830 
you see and the first two rows the

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.170 
you see and the first two rows the
bottom<00:00:48.220> line<00:00:48.430> which<00:00:48.670> is<00:00:48.820> looking<00:00:49.030> at

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
the major point about adolescent brain

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.890 
the major point about adolescent brain
is<00:01:52.240> that<00:01:53.080> this<00:01:53.680> prefrontal<00:01:54.130> cortex<00:01:54.850> is<00:01:55.150> very

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
is that this prefrontal cortex is very

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.960 
is that this prefrontal cortex is very
slow<00:01:56.200> to<00:01:56.229> mature<00:01:56.440> and<00:01:57.369> it<00:01:57.490> progressively

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
slow to mature and it progressively

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.540 
slow to mature and it progressively
comes<00:01:58.330> online<00:01:58.840> and<00:01:59.080> so<00:01:59.380> much<00:01:59.680> of<00:02:00.009> the

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550

transition between being a kid and being

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.550 
transition between being a kid and being
adult<00:02:03.430> is<00:02:03.759> this<00:02:04.330> unfolding<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:05.259> prefrontal

years<00:02:12.970> now<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:13.510> by<00:02:14.050> far<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:15.550> most<00:02:15.700> common

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
years now and by far the most common

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.510 
years now and by far the most common
implication<00:02:16.930> is<00:02:17.050> that<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.440> optimal<00:02:17.980> internal

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
implication is that the optimal internal

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.820 
implication is that the optimal internal
state<00:02:18.760> for<00:02:19.030> learning<00:02:19.390> is<00:02:19.810> relaxed<00:02:20.530> alertness

state for learning is relaxed alertness
it's<00:02:21.760> just<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.120> way<00:02:22.239> our<00:02:22.420> brains<00:02:22.720> work<00:02:22.900> when

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
it's just the way our brains work when

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.800 
it's just the way our brains work when
we're<00:02:23.590> stressed<00:02:23.920> we<00:02:24.910> respond<00:02:25.360> instinctively

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
we're stressed we respond instinctively

we're stressed we respond instinctively
we<00:02:26.500> aren't<00:02:26.709> supposed<00:02:26.860> to<00:02:27.220> learn<00:02:27.400> and<00:02:27.700> we<00:02:28.060> can't

young<00:02:33.400> people<00:02:33.459> meditate<00:02:34.150> it<00:02:34.600> works<00:02:34.840> when

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
young people meditate it works when

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.500 
young people meditate it works when
you're<00:02:35.620> less<00:02:35.830> stressed<00:02:36.000> you<00:02:37.000> can<00:02:37.180> focus

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
you're less stressed you can focus

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.020 
you're less stressed you can focus
better<00:02:37.660> you<00:02:38.530> can<00:02:38.680> resist<00:02:38.950> distraction<00:02:39.760> better

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
better you can resist distraction better

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.330 
better you can resist distraction better
and<00:02:40.630> when<00:02:41.530> you<00:02:41.620> have<00:02:41.769> this<00:02:41.860> increased

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
and when you have this increased

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.670 
and when you have this increased
coherence<00:02:43.060> in<00:02:43.269> brain<00:02:43.480> functioning<00:02:44.019> you<00:02:44.530> can

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
coherence in brain functioning you can

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.949 
coherence in brain functioning you can
organize<00:02:45.130> your<00:02:45.190> thinking<00:02:45.760> better<00:02:46.120> your<00:02:46.720> sense

organize your thinking better your sense
of<00:02:47.080> priorities<00:02:47.709> is<00:02:47.860> better<00:02:48.070> you<00:02:48.519> can

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
of priorities is better you can

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.600 
of priorities is better you can
integrate<00:02:48.910> information<00:02:49.720> better<00:02:50.430> one<00:02:51.430> of<00:02:51.459> the

integrate information better one of the
really<00:02:51.880> important<00:02:52.269> things<00:02:52.450> from<00:02:52.570> my<00:02:52.690> point<00:02:52.900> of

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
really important things from my point of

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.380 
really important things from my point of
view<00:02:53.110> is<00:02:53.530> there's<00:02:54.010> also<00:02:54.280> a<00:02:54.519> significant

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
view is there's also a significant

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.259 
view is there's also a significant
reduction<00:02:55.570> in<00:02:56.049> emotional<00:02:57.010> reactivity<00:02:57.340> and

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
reduction in emotional reactivity and

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.449 
reduction in emotional reactivity and
when<00:02:59.019> I<00:02:59.049> talk<00:02:59.350> with<00:02:59.590> kids<00:02:59.860> one<00:03:00.160> of<00:03:00.250> the<00:03:00.310> things

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
when I talk with kids one of the things

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.550 
when I talk with kids one of the things
I<00:03:00.549> really<00:03:00.760> emphasize<00:03:00.940> with<00:03:01.450> them<00:03:01.630> is<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:02.380> need

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
I really emphasize with them is the need

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.650 
I really emphasize with them is the need
to<00:03:02.739> build<00:03:02.920> their<00:03:03.190> stress<00:03:03.519> tolerance<00:03:03.850> but

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
to build their stress tolerance but

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.050 
to build their stress tolerance but
their<00:03:05.110> ability<00:03:05.200> to<00:03:05.470> manage<00:03:06.250> themselves<00:03:06.459> in

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
their ability to manage themselves in

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.940 
their ability to manage themselves in
stressful<00:03:07.570> situations<00:03:08.200> so<00:03:08.350> they<00:03:08.380> don't<00:03:08.680> quit

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
stressful situations so they don't quit

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.420 
stressful situations so they don't quit
or<00:03:09.459> they<00:03:09.580> don't<00:03:09.700> freak<00:03:10.030> out<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:11.830> research<00:03:12.190> on

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
or they don't freak out the research on

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.460 
or they don't freak out the research on
it<00:03:12.610> is<00:03:12.790> showing<00:03:13.540> that<00:03:13.690> where<00:03:14.080> kids<00:03:14.350> are

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
it is showing that where kids are

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.949 
it is showing that where kids are
meditating<00:03:14.799> twice<00:03:15.310> a<00:03:15.340> day<00:03:15.610> in<00:03:15.730> school

meditating twice a day in school

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.390 
meditating twice a day in school
improvement<00:03:16.959> in<00:03:17.019> all<00:03:17.260> kinds<00:03:17.830> of<00:03:17.890> important

areas and it seems to me that given what

areas and it seems to me that given what

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
we know about what TM can do to improve

we know about what TM can do to improve
the<00:03:24.430> lives<00:03:24.610> of<00:03:24.730> young<00:03:24.880> people<00:03:25.270> I<00:03:25.480> think<00:03:25.810> it's

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
the lives of young people I think it's

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.110 
the lives of young people I think it's
cruel<00:03:26.440> not<00:03:27.010> to<00:03:27.069> teach<00:03:27.340> it<00:03:27.490> to<00:03:27.580> them<00:03:27.730> at<00:03:27.940> least

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
cruel not to teach it to them at least

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.350 
cruel not to teach it to them at least
good
