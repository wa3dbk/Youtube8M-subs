yeah that's pretty much it on the
outside<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.890> package<00:01:35.340> not<00:01:35.759> too<00:01:35.970> much<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.390> it

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
outside of package not too much to it

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.569 
outside of package not too much to it
this<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:36.900> weird<00:01:37.079> called<00:01:37.320> your<00:01:37.530> design<00:01:38.250> and

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
this is weird called your design and

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.880 
this is weird called your design and
then<00:01:38.850> on<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.090> back<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.540> my<00:01:39.659> wording<00:01:39.930> but<00:01:40.229> let's

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
then on the back so my wording but let's

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.670 
then on the back so my wording but let's
get<00:01:41.070> into<00:01:41.220> this<00:01:41.460> package<00:01:42.170> let's<00:01:43.170> see<00:01:43.470> where<00:01:43.649> I

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
get into this package let's see where I

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
actually the best way if I just go in

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.010 
actually the best way if I just go in
the<00:02:13.150> window<00:02:13.420> here<00:02:13.770> pop<00:02:14.770> it<00:02:14.950> open<00:02:15.100> like<00:02:15.340> that

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
the window here pop it open like that

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.390 
the window here pop it open like that
here<00:02:17.020> we<00:02:17.080> go<00:02:17.170> for<00:02:17.440> some<00:02:17.560> reason<00:02:17.920> I<00:02:17.980> always<00:02:18.010> have

here we go for some reason I always have

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.390 
here we go for some reason I always have
trouble<00:02:19.020> Rep<00:02:20.020> on<00:02:20.200> wrapping<00:02:20.740> stuff<00:02:20.980> it's<00:02:21.280> kind

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
trouble Rep on wrapping stuff it's kind

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.660 
trouble Rep on wrapping stuff it's kind
of<00:02:21.610> odd<00:02:22.170> but<00:02:23.170> eventually<00:02:23.590> I<00:02:23.890> do<00:02:24.040> get<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.490> job

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
of odd but eventually I do get the job

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.260 
of odd but eventually I do get the job
done<00:02:24.840> get<00:02:25.840> all<00:02:25.990> this<00:02:26.110> plastic<00:02:26.440> off<00:02:26.830> in<00:02:27.790> the

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
done get all this plastic off in the

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.570 
done get all this plastic off in the
packaging<00:02:28.990> I<00:02:29.080> thought<00:02:29.290> was<00:02:29.440> actually<00:02:29.620> smaller

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
packaging I thought was actually smaller

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.610 
packaging I thought was actually smaller
it's<00:02:31.239> actually<00:02:31.330> smaller<00:02:31.750> than<00:02:31.870> I<00:02:32.050> expected<00:02:32.200> it

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
it's actually smaller than I expected it

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.680 
it's actually smaller than I expected it
to<00:02:32.680> be<00:02:32.770> expected<00:02:33.400> the<00:02:33.520> package<00:02:33.819> be<00:02:33.970> a<00:02:34.360> bit

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
to be expected the package be a bit

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.750 
to be expected the package be a bit
larger<00:02:35.170> but<00:02:35.739> you<00:02:35.860> know<00:02:35.980> it's<00:02:36.190> just<00:02:36.310> outcomes

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
larger but you know it's just outcomes

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.660 
larger but you know it's just outcomes
then<00:02:37.239> this<00:02:37.600> just<00:02:37.840> slides<00:02:38.110> out<00:02:38.410> like<00:02:38.650> that<00:02:38.890> like

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
then this just slides out like that like

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.400 
then this just slides out like that like
so<00:02:39.940> it's<00:02:40.239> kind<00:02:40.420> of<00:02:40.450> blue<00:02:41.050> on<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.380> inside

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
so it's kind of blue on the inside

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.460 
so it's kind of blue on the inside
actually<00:02:42.160> it's<00:02:42.430> kind<00:02:42.610> of<00:02:42.670> nice<00:02:43.020> then<00:02:44.020> here<00:02:44.350> it

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
actually it's kind of nice then here it

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.190 
actually it's kind of nice then here it
is<00:02:44.530> here's<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.100> package<00:02:45.250> itself<00:02:45.730> I<00:02:46.140> kind<00:02:47.140> of

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
is here's the package itself I kind of

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.740 
is here's the package itself I kind of
just<00:02:47.320> lay<00:02:47.470> it<00:02:47.530> down<00:02:47.739> you<00:02:48.040> flip<00:02:48.519> it<00:02:48.670> open<00:02:48.850> and<00:02:49.209> it

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
just lay it down you flip it open and it

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.860 
just lay it down you flip it open and it
says<00:02:49.959> welcome<00:02:50.580> honest<00:02:51.580> there<00:02:51.850> obviously<00:02:52.450> this

is just kind of like a welcome guide
this<00:02:55.090> is<00:02:55.360> a<00:02:55.390> getting<00:02:56.019> started<00:02:56.320> pretty<00:02:56.800> much

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
this is a getting started pretty much

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.130 
this is a getting started pretty much
getting<00:02:57.400> your<00:02:57.550> way<00:02:57.640> around<00:02:57.760> windows<00:02:58.239> 8<00:02:58.420> his

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
getting your way around windows 8 his

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.040 
getting your way around windows 8 his
windows<00:02:59.500> 8<00:02:59.680> 32<00:03:00.340> so<00:03:00.850> give<00:03:01.030> you<00:03:01.150> a<00:03:01.209> 32-bit

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
windows 8 32 so give you a 32-bit

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.650 
windows 8 32 so give you a 32-bit
version<00:03:02.440> and<00:03:02.650> the<00:03:03.100> 64-bit<00:03:03.940> version<00:03:04.330> just<00:03:04.569> in

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
version and the 64-bit version just in

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.559 
version and the 64-bit version just in
case<00:03:04.840> which<00:03:05.940> model<00:03:06.940> you<00:03:06.970> have<00:03:07.209> or<00:03:07.480> which

case which model you have or which

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.020 
case which model you have or which
computer<00:03:07.989> or<00:03:08.530> you<00:03:09.069> know<00:03:09.160> what<00:03:09.370> bit<00:03:09.580> version

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
computer or you know what bit version

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.059 
computer or you know what bit version
your<00:03:10.180> computer<00:03:10.510> is<00:03:10.569> running<00:03:10.660> on<00:03:10.870> and<00:03:11.500> this<00:03:11.860> is

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
your computer is running on and this is

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.520 
your computer is running on and this is
obviously<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:13.080> activation<00:03:14.080> key<00:03:14.260> I'm

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
obviously the activation key I'm

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:15.990 
obviously the activation key I'm
definitely<00:03:14.830> not<00:03:15.280> going<00:03:15.519> to<00:03:15.610> show<00:03:15.730> you<00:03:15.790> guys

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
definitely not going to show you guys

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.789 
definitely not going to show you guys
what<00:03:16.540> that<00:03:16.569> looks<00:03:16.930> like<00:03:17.049> on<00:03:17.290> the<00:03:17.440> other<00:03:17.470> side

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
what that looks like on the other side

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.009 
what that looks like on the other side
but<00:03:18.280> there's<00:03:18.489> that<00:03:18.700> put<00:03:19.600> that<00:03:19.720> off<00:03:19.840> to<00:03:19.989> the

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
but there's that put that off to the

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.140 
but there's that put that off to the
side<00:03:20.110> and<00:03:21.070> that's<00:03:21.250> pretty<00:03:21.400> much<00:03:21.519> it<00:03:21.640> there's

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
side and that's pretty much it there's

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.289 
side and that's pretty much it there's
really<00:03:22.299> nothing<00:03:22.690> else<00:03:22.780> to<00:03:22.930> open<00:03:23.650> up<00:03:23.769> to<00:03:24.299> yep

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
really nothing else to open up to yep

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.319 
really nothing else to open up to yep
other<00:03:26.079> than<00:03:26.230> that<00:03:26.290> it's<00:03:26.500> pretty<00:03:26.560> much<00:03:26.739> empty
