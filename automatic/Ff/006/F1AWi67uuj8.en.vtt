00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 in the institutions to which the 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:08.010
 Black men have to answer 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:10.639
 obviously attention the kremlin the fbi and 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.440
 the cia that life is making us feel 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:16.350
 Believe me that today by the iguana of 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.600
 power a little the level of friendship between 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:24.300
 US and final and not operational 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:26.430
 clearly and that of course the worst 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.289
 but in the USA they talk about the parent company 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.699
 and in other parts of the world they have 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.170
 branches because if there is a sighting 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.180
 stop an example in punta sands as 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.250
 the effective and spending fast to the place 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.079
 totally and I give you a local example that 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.120
 I know chiles in chile have 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.520
 branches are some of certain 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.379
 characteristics for the military go 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.789
 the carabineros are even closer 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.530
 for example if this is a one in a 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.480
 hill as it happened the proximity of the 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.520
 steel but immediately have to 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.160
 stop the red phone and call one of 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.870
 these heard man go to the whole home 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.879
 decided because it is under the control of 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.379
 the governments that help those who 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.879
 We are dedicated to hide information and 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.820
 the military that have a department 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.559
 then a link absolutely not and that 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.000
 that there be no doubt in the least that he 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.540
 you can ask any military man of 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.970
 China 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.760
 / brave on our shores or like that 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.520
 there is even talk of secret losses in 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.070
 the deserts of the north attention all of 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.300
 front people who have been threatened by 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.830
 the men in black this their story the 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.780
 men approached him dressed as 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.050
 black they looked at me and said see you 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.050
 soon 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.329
 I am nissan if I have been threatened by 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.329
 men in black for 34 years 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.830
 we are going to meet with johnny sans a 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.650
 country music singer in 1976 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.540
 while driving through las vegas he had a 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.070
 of the strangest experiences 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.200
 we have listened as a man reads a 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.840
 ray of light in the sky that pointed 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.590
 direct towards me he was an object in 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.590
 cylinder 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.539
 Johnny's car was extinguished while 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.180
 I tried to repair the car 2 of what 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.560
 he calls extraterrestrial addressed 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.840
 towards him 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.940
 as they got closer I started to 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.600
 to run but I realized that I could not 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:23.200
 move 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.850
 they had bulging eyes very small mouth 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.760
 and drowned like that of a man without 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.340
 teeth and they had a long, wide nose 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.570
 and it looked like something that stood out to 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.570
 each side of the face 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.200
 here we have an emblematic case 1916 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.860
 gmt are worth twice as long as the 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.560
 movie and half of those sellers 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:49.230
 exactly as in the movie they are not 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.360
 completely dysfunctional boats 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.190
 about life there exactly 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.310
 social tools and more tone 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.870
 distant even it's like everything 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.280
 what you show him you offer him as 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.600
 first is that then I first time 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.310
 that they are not knowing but they 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:07.080
 will bring all kinds of people 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.030
 Imagine a few days ago I understand 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.830
 sightings of video uploaded to youtube 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.840
 of people who saw strange light do not 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.160
 they cover let's say the total spectrum but 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.050
 those who have had say with 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.480
 some encounters that is more good 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.400
 of abysmal features like this 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.470
 man who sees the road blatant and 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.020
 see is a ship let's say with the 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.290
 fuselage in broad daylight which is a 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.490
 cylinder like a gigantic building 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.190
 navigating horizontally with respect to 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:36.510
 I'm saying something like that, someone can tell 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:38.820
 and that the polygraph can testify 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.150
 clearly where it is not true detector 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:44.840
 of lies economic exams 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:47.580
 that was in 76 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.920
 I think a man confronts me 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.750
 I tell someone and why they learn in 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.340
 actually they see what happened to port 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.050
 place where you live that is the 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.970
 million similar question where there 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.190
 11 are they clear that when one 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.710
 question is urgent the government os 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.960
 urgent that directly from the same 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.400
 object that tube be more routine in 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.470
 these times that have so that there 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.670
 a kind of position especially the 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.950
 next to those that although it seems joke 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.290
 that to shut up so you do not know about 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.690
 this now the question I had asked 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.790
 before María José because they silence everything 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.430
 This is because there are people who 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.109
 seem when they investigate and they are taking 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.540
 the layers of onion this mystery 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:26.490
 they end up understanding that young people 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.520
 they have a much closer relationship 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.900
 with the governments of our world of what 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.390
 that one can get to imagine 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.910
 it is worth saying some young people maybe if they are 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.650
 built are recreated on earth and 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.210
 therefore, that never reach 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.910
 know in terms of security 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.920
 good national talking about this person 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.780
 that was threatened by the UFOs let's go 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.680
 now to someone who was killed by 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.539
 the men in black 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.000
 already well it is usually believed that the best 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:54.789
 cases of men in black are cases 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.100
 old are in many cases 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:05:01.509
 patients do not have the same publicity 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:03.370
 for a simple reason most of the 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:05.410
 people specialized in 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:09.660
 research in men in black 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.660
 they died mysteriously 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.540
 Some of them were over 40 or 50 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.129
 years the people who come closest to 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.589
 the truth die 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:23.699
 with a famous zoologist is the legendary 

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:25.839
 author morris cap and is a pioneer 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:27.819
 he wrote numerous books and some 

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:29.949
 researchers believe that when 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:34.080
 Men too close to the truth 

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:34.080
 in black they shut him up forever
