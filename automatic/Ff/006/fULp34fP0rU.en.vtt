alright<00:00:00.269> here's<00:00:00.539> going<00:00:00.690> to<00:00:00.750> be<00:00:00.810> a<00:00:00.870> quick<00:00:01.170> video

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:01.500 
alright here's going to be a quick video

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.900 
alright here's going to be a quick video
of<00:00:01.680> how<00:00:01.709> to<00:00:01.860> do<00:00:02.040> a<00:00:02.070> oil<00:00:02.580> change<00:00:02.939> on<00:00:03.210> your<00:00:04.910> 2000

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
of how to do a oil change on your 2000

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.740 
of how to do a oil change on your 2000
and<00:00:06.270> I<00:00:07.670> think<00:00:08.670> it's<00:00:08.960> 1<00:00:09.960> or<00:00:11.240> 2002<00:00:12.240> all<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.660> way

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
and I think it's 1 or 2002 all the way

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.109 
and I think it's 1 or 2002 all the way
up<00:00:12.840> to<00:00:13.460> 2006<00:00:14.460> I'm<00:00:14.759> pretty<00:00:15.000> sure<00:00:16.340> 3.0<00:00:17.340> oil

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
up to 2006 I'm pretty sure 3.0 oil

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.000 
up to 2006 I'm pretty sure 3.0 oil
changes<00:00:18.570> on<00:00:18.720> here<00:00:18.980> x3<00:00:19.980> if<00:00:20.880> I'm<00:00:21.090> wrong<00:00:22.010> make

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
changes on here x3 if I'm wrong make

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.029 
changes on here x3 if I'm wrong make
sure<00:00:23.189> you<00:00:23.340> check<00:00:24.529> exactly<00:00:25.529> how<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.710> get<00:00:25.890> your

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
sure you check exactly how to get your

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.410 
sure you check exactly how to get your
oil<00:00:26.220> changes<00:00:26.550> done<00:00:26.699> but<00:00:26.880> this<00:00:27.000> gives<00:00:27.240> you<00:00:27.330> an

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
oil changes done but this gives you an

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.530 
oil changes done but this gives you an
idea<00:00:28.189> so<00:00:29.189> you're<00:00:29.369> going<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.550> have<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:32.329> one<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.360> a

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
idea so you're going to have a one and a

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.360 
idea so you're going to have a one and a
half<00:00:33.570> inch<00:00:33.899> socket<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:36.800> more<00:00:37.800> whatever<00:00:38.250> else

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
half inch socket and more whatever else

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.380 
half inch socket and more whatever else
you<00:00:38.550> can<00:00:38.610> get<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.629> get<00:00:39.780> this<00:00:39.960> top<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.379> off<00:00:41.390> and

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
you can get to get this top that off and

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.619 
you can get to get this top that off and
this<00:00:42.870> will<00:00:43.050> come<00:00:43.290> right<00:00:44.010> off<00:00:47.239> and<00:00:48.239> your<00:00:48.600> oil

I'm<00:00:54.360> washing<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.809> engine<00:00:55.170> bay<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:55.410> not<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:55.949> big

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
I'm washing the engine bay so not a big

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:03.770 
I'm washing the engine bay so not a big
deal<00:01:00.140> but<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.289> can<00:01:01.440> see

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:14.140 

your<00:01:04.440> oil<00:01:04.680> filter<00:01:12.470> okay

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
your oil filter okay

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.520 
your oil filter okay
now<00:01:15.150> under<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.540> car

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.310 

this<00:01:19.130> is<00:01:19.310> from<00:01:19.549> an<00:01:19.700> x5<00:01:20.090> well<00:01:20.600> Kimberly<00:01:20.990> that's

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
this is from an x5 well Kimberly that's

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.580 
this is from an x5 well Kimberly that's
in<00:01:21.440> the<00:01:21.500> ground<00:01:25.060> then<00:01:26.060> you<00:01:26.240> have<00:01:26.479> this<00:01:27.229> plate

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
in the ground then you have this plate

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.219 
in the ground then you have this plate
and<00:01:28.090> this<00:01:29.090> is<00:01:29.270> because<00:01:29.600> it<00:01:29.750> has<00:01:29.869> all-wheel

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
and this is because it has all-wheel

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.280 
and this is because it has all-wheel
drive<00:01:31.390> that's<00:01:32.390> why<00:01:32.570> it's<00:01:32.720> in<00:01:32.840> this<00:01:32.960> location

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
drive that's why it's in this location

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.800 
drive that's why it's in this location
I'm<00:01:33.590> pretty<00:01:33.799> sure<00:01:34.479> there's<00:01:35.479> going<00:01:35.630> to<00:01:35.690> be<00:01:35.750> a

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
I'm pretty sure there's going to be a

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.069 
I'm pretty sure there's going to be a
bolt<00:01:36.700> and<00:01:37.700> we<00:01:37.880> will<00:01:38.030> just

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
bolt and we will just

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:51.170 
bolt and we will just
pull<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.740> bolt<00:01:40.950> out

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.050 

okay<00:01:51.840> here<00:01:52.230> it<00:01:52.320> comes<00:01:53.660> it's<00:01:54.660> really<00:01:54.930> hot<00:01:56.060> maybe

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
okay here it comes it's really hot maybe

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.760 
okay here it comes it's really hot maybe
let<00:01:57.270> your<00:01:57.390> car<00:01:57.630> cool<00:01:57.840> down<00:01:58.050> if<00:01:58.350> you're

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
let your car cool down if you're

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.580 
let your car cool down if you're
sensitive<00:01:59.190> to<00:01:59.310> heat<00:01:59.580> and<00:01:59.850> it's<00:02:00.780> going<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.730> blow

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
sensitive to heat and it's going to blow

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:12.050 
sensitive to heat and it's going to blow
this<00:02:09.830> projects<00:02:10.830> pretty<00:02:11.070> far<00:02:11.340> so<00:02:11.640> take<00:02:11.880> that

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
this projects pretty far so take that

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.580 
this projects pretty far so take that
into<00:02:12.240> account<00:02:12.270> if<00:02:12.870> you're<00:02:13.050> doing<00:02:13.320> this<00:02:13.440> on

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
into account if you're doing this on

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.260 
into account if you're doing this on
driveway<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.870> this<00:02:15.870> will<00:02:16.050> go<00:02:16.230> for<00:02:16.560> a<00:02:17.270> couple

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
driveway and this will go for a couple

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:26.580 
driveway and this will go for a couple
minutes<00:02:19.430> now<00:02:20.430> there's<00:02:20.610> no<00:02:20.820> ring<00:02:21.090> on<00:02:22.370> your<00:02:23.370> bolt

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.780 

and<00:02:27.099> mine<00:02:27.940> looks<00:02:27.970> good<00:02:28.800> it<00:02:29.800> wasn't<00:02:30.010> too<00:02:30.310> wet<00:02:30.520> so
