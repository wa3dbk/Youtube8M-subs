the action the one problem this can

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.500 
the action the one problem this can
cause<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.110> players<00:00:43.710> don't<00:00:44.430> spawn<00:00:45.090> into

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
cause is that players don't spawn into

cause is that players don't spawn into

the game at the exact same time
everyone's<00:00:48.840> network<00:00:49.200> connection<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:49.800> a

everyone's network connection is a

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.520 
everyone's network connection is a
little<00:00:50.250> different<00:00:50.700> so<00:00:51.090> what<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:51.930> means<00:00:52.260> is

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
little different so what this means is

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.160 
little different so what this means is
that<00:00:52.590> some<00:00:53.039> players<00:00:53.280> end<00:00:53.699> up<00:00:54.120> having<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.809> split

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
that some players end up having a split

second head start at the beginning of
the<00:00:57.120> race<00:00:57.270> so<00:00:57.870> what<00:00:58.440> this<00:00:58.590> has<00:00:58.800> led<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.039> is<00:00:59.520> that

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
the race so what this has led to is that

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.889 
the race so what this has led to is that
in<00:01:00.420> some<00:01:00.690> cases<00:01:01.250> map<00:01:02.250> builders<00:01:02.820> have<00:01:03.270> used

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
in some cases map builders have used

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.230 
in some cases map builders have used
creative<00:01:04.500> forging<00:01:05.189> techniques<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:06.000> build

creative forging techniques to build

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.020 
creative forging techniques to build

various forms of starting gates these

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.370 
various forms of starting gates these
