00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
possible because the 3d panorama will

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.359 
possible because the 3d panorama will
you'll<00:01:55.170> be<00:01:55.229> able<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.530> spin<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:55.829> around<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.250> new

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
you'll be able to spin it around a new

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.480 
you'll be able to spin it around a new
browser<00:01:56.610> which<00:01:57.390> will<00:01:57.600> then<00:01:57.810> allow

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
to kind of see the full scene if there's

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.770 
to kind of see the full scene if there's
any<00:02:00.890> overages<00:02:01.490> you'll<00:02:01.850> you'll<00:02:02.210> notice<00:02:02.570> the

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
any overages you'll you'll notice the

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.010 
any overages you'll you'll notice the
the<00:02:03.049> split<00:02:03.380> line<00:02:03.560> between<00:02:03.860> it<00:02:04.250> also<00:02:05.060> when

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
the split line between it also when

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.450 
the split line between it also when
you're<00:02:06.140> taking<00:02:06.290> your<00:02:06.470> spinner<00:02:06.799> shots<00:02:07.130> if

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
you're taking your spinner shots if

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.550 
you're taking your spinner shots if
you're<00:02:07.700> familiar<00:02:08.390> with<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:08.869> camera<00:02:09.289> as<00:02:09.530> a

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
you're familiar with the camera as a

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.130 
you're familiar with the camera as a
little<00:02:09.920> bubble<00:02:10.310> level<00:02:10.610> on<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:10.849> top<00:02:11.060> so<00:02:11.360> the

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
little bubble level on the top so the

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.770 
little bubble level on the top so the
more<00:02:12.380> level<00:02:12.739> the<00:02:12.830> photo<00:02:13.099> is<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.670> better<00:02:13.940> the

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
more level the photo is the better the

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.570 
more level the photo is the better the
photo<00:02:15.140> will<00:02:15.739> actually<00:02:16.280> become<00:02:17.120> 3d<00:02:18.069> so<00:02:19.069> once

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
photo will actually become 3d so once

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.460 
photo will actually become 3d so once
you<00:02:19.700> have<00:02:19.730> your<00:02:20.030> area<00:02:20.360> select<00:02:20.780> it<00:02:20.900> out<00:02:21.050> in<00:02:21.290> your

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
you have your area select it out in your

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
the image here which is where I took the

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.050 
the image here which is where I took the
photo<00:03:36.079> which<00:03:36.350> is<00:03:36.500> that<00:03:36.680> the<00:03:37.370> broadway<00:03:37.790> station

Denver<00:03:39.760> these<00:03:40.760> set<00:03:41.030> values<00:03:41.540> essentially<00:03:42.319> tell

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
Denver these set values essentially tell

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.660 
Denver these set values essentially tell
the<00:03:44.510> panorama<00:03:45.079> how<00:03:45.440> it's<00:03:45.920> going<00:03:46.280> to<00:03:46.459> move

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
the panorama how it's going to move

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.910 
the panorama how it's going to move
around<00:03:46.959> what<00:03:47.959> i've<00:03:48.079> found<00:03:48.109> is<00:03:48.590> that<00:03:48.650> it

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
around what i've found is that it

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.699 
around what i've found is that it
typically<00:03:49.370> sets<00:03:50.329> these<00:03:50.569> pretty<00:03:51.200> accurately

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
typically sets these pretty accurately

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:52.510 
typically sets these pretty accurately
so<00:03:52.010> I

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
so I

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:58.060 
so I
to<00:03:52.820> set<00:03:53.330> those<00:03:54.820> you'll<00:03:55.820> probably<00:03:56.480> want<00:03:56.990> to<00:03:57.080> set

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
to set those you'll probably want to set

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.320 
to set those you'll probably want to set
a<00:03:58.100> location<00:03:58.960> for<00:04:00.370> your<00:04:01.370> photo<00:04:01.610> and<00:04:01.910> it's

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
a location for your photo and it's

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.210 
a location for your photo and it's
pretty<00:04:02.630> cool<00:04:02.840> it<00:04:03.020> kind<00:04:03.350> of<00:04:03.410> shows<00:04:03.620> up<00:04:03.860> next<00:04:04.160> to

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
pretty cool it kind of shows up next to

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.900 
pretty cool it kind of shows up next to
the<00:04:04.310> picture<00:04:04.460> in<00:04:05.080> Google+<00:04:06.080> so<00:04:06.920> you<00:04:07.520> may<00:04:07.670> want

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
the picture in Google+ so you may want

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.450 
the picture in Google+ so you may want
to<00:04:07.970> find<00:04:08.060> the<00:04:08.780> location<00:04:09.440> in<00:04:09.590> google<00:04:09.620> maps<00:04:09.920> and
