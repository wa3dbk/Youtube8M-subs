but<00:02:48.030> you<00:02:48.090> know<00:02:48.390> it<00:02:48.959> takes<00:02:49.200> a<00:02:49.290> little<00:02:49.470> bit<00:02:49.620> to

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
but you know it takes a little bit to

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.660 
but you know it takes a little bit to
get<00:02:50.040> over<00:02:50.340> here

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
get over here

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.339 
get over here
not<00:02:50.880> too<00:02:51.030> long<00:02:51.420> I<00:02:51.450> mean<00:02:51.750> strike<00:02:52.049> zones<00:02:52.230> in
