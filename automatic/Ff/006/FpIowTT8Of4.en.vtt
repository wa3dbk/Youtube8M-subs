00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
to the base so you have a remote control

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.959 
to the base so you have a remote control
just<00:01:54.390> like<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.890> has<00:01:56.070> 20<00:01:56.430> solid<00:01:56.790> color

little too much for you you've got a

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.580 
little too much for you you've got a
pattern<00:02:42.390> of<00:02:42.420> speeds<00:02:42.750> you<00:02:43.500> just<00:02:43.680> crank<00:02:43.860> it<00:02:43.980> down

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
pattern of speeds you just crank it down

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.750 
pattern of speeds you just crank it down
kind<00:02:46.590> of<00:02:46.710> fine-tune<00:02:46.950> it<00:02:47.280> to<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.460> mood<00:02:47.610> you

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
kind of fine-tune it to the mood you

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.940 
kind of fine-tune it to the mood you
want<00:02:47.790> to<00:02:47.940> achieve<00:02:48.030> at<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.360> event<00:02:48.830> we<00:02:49.830> also

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
want to achieve at the event we also

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.620 
want to achieve at the event we also
have<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.430> seven<00:02:50.910> color<00:02:51.090> jump

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
have the seven color jump

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.290 
have the seven color jump
same<00:02:52.260> principle<00:02:52.830> I<00:02:53.750> can<00:02:54.750> count<00:02:54.959> it<00:02:55.050> down<00:02:56.300> and

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
same principle I can count it down and

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.430 
same principle I can count it down and
you<00:02:57.420> also<00:02:57.630> have<00:02:57.959> the<00:02:58.230> seven<00:02:59.220> color<00:02:59.400> fade<00:03:00.440> to

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
you also have the seven color fade to

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.199 
you also have the seven color fade to
gradual<00:03:01.980> fade<00:03:04.670> there<00:03:05.670> is<00:03:05.820> a<00:03:05.880> little<00:03:06.120> bit

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
gradual fade there is a little bit

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:11.360 
gradual fade there is a little bit
slower<00:03:09.380> then<00:03:10.380> you<00:03:10.500> can<00:03:10.620> change<00:03:10.830> multiple

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
slower then you can change multiple

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.000 
slower then you can change multiple
tables<00:03:11.790> with<00:03:12.360> one<00:03:12.600> remote<00:03:12.870> so<00:03:13.260> if<00:03:13.680> I<00:03:13.770> stand

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
tables with one remote so if I stand

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.740 
tables with one remote so if I stand
back<00:03:14.160> here<00:03:14.430> you<00:03:15.000> might<00:03:15.180> have<00:03:15.300> noticed<00:03:15.570> some<00:03:15.690> of

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
back here you might have noticed some of

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.540 
back here you might have noticed some of
these<00:03:15.810> changing<00:03:16.230> together<00:03:16.500> you<00:03:17.220> can<00:03:17.400> just

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
these changing together you can just

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.449 
these changing together you can just
point<00:03:18.330> and<00:03:18.480> click

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
point and click

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:26.320 
point and click
it's<00:03:20.459> a<00:03:20.550> little<00:03:20.850> green<00:03:23.330> well<00:03:24.330> up<00:03:24.510> no<00:03:24.930> problem<00:03:25.380> a

it's a little green well up no problem a

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.790 
it's a little green well up no problem a
great<00:03:27.330> feature<00:03:27.510> about<00:03:27.750> these<00:03:28.050> tables<00:03:28.470> is<00:03:28.650> they

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
great feature about these tables is they
