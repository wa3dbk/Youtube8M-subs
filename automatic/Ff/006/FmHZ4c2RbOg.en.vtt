00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
great stuff shifting gear changes as you

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.280 
great stuff shifting gear changes as you
can<00:03:20.430> see<00:03:20.610> there<00:03:20.820> Lewis<00:03:21.090> Hamilton<00:03:21.690> with<00:03:22.170> his

can see there Lewis Hamilton with his
fingers<00:03:22.680> changing<00:03:23.550> gear<00:03:23.730> all<00:03:23.850> the<00:03:23.880> way

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
fingers changing gear all the way

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.420 
fingers changing gear all the way
through<00:03:24.300> lock<00:03:24.480> it<00:03:24.690> takes<00:03:24.870> an<00:03:25.140> extreme<00:03:25.830> wide

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
through lock it takes an extreme wide

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.750 
through lock it takes an extreme wide
line<00:03:26.910> really<00:03:27.360> and<00:03:27.480> just<00:03:27.860> didn't<00:03:28.860> really<00:03:29.490> lose

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
line really and just didn't really lose

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.460 
line really and just didn't really lose
being<00:03:30.030> quite<00:03:30.210> so<00:03:30.360> close<00:03:30.540> I<00:03:30.660> don't<00:03:30.810> think<00:03:31.020> a<00:03:31.170> bit

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
being quite so close I don't think a bit

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.410 
being quite so close I don't think a bit
too<00:03:31.680> much<00:03:31.830> Mallory<00:03:32.220> Park<00:03:32.550> hairpin<00:03:32.940> there<00:03:33.210> and

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
too much Mallory Park hairpin there and

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.240 
too much Mallory Park hairpin there and
yeah<00:03:34.050> not<00:03:34.260> enough<00:03:34.440> defense

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
yeah not enough defense

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.040 
yeah not enough defense
but<00:03:36.760> then<00:03:36.880> he<00:03:37.000> knew<00:03:37.210> what<00:03:37.420> a<00:03:37.450> tow<00:03:37.660> he<00:03:37.780> given

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
but then he knew what a tow he given

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.450 
but then he knew what a tow he given
away<00:03:38.260> on<00:03:38.380> the<00:03:38.500> straight<00:03:38.770> and<00:03:38.800> he<00:03:39.070> could<00:03:39.220> think

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:39.460 
away on the straight and he could think

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.100 
away on the straight and he could think
the<00:03:39.910> exactly<00:03:40.270> the<00:03:40.360> same<00:03:40.450> thing<00:03:40.750> was<00:03:40.870> going<00:03:40.900> to

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
the exactly the same thing was going to

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.210 
the exactly the same thing was going to
happen<00:03:41.260> sort<00:03:41.560> of<00:03:41.620> devil<00:03:41.860> and<00:03:41.950> the<00:03:42.010> deep<00:03:42.190> blue

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
happen sort of devil and the deep blue

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.340 
happen sort of devil and the deep blue
sea<00:03:42.580> when<00:03:42.790> the<00:03:43.000> guy<00:03:43.390> coming<00:03:43.780> up<00:03:43.840> behind<00:03:43.990> it's

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
sea when the guy coming up behind it's

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.430 
sea when the guy coming up behind it's
not<00:03:44.470> so<00:03:44.890> much<00:03:45.340> speed<00:03:45.850> yes<00:03:46.360> yeah<00:03:46.930> because<00:03:47.170> if

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
not so much speed yes yeah because if

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.960 
not so much speed yes yeah because if
block<00:03:47.920> had<00:03:48.040> gotten<00:03:48.190> tighter<00:03:48.490> there<00:03:48.790> then

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
block had gotten tighter there then

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.130 
block had gotten tighter there then
Hamilton<00:03:49.330> would<00:03:49.420> have<00:03:49.510> gone<00:03:49.600> wide<00:03:49.840> and<00:03:50.020> got<00:03:50.110> a

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
Hamilton would have gone wide and got a

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.450 
Hamilton would have gone wide and got a
I've<00:03:50.320> got<00:03:50.350> a<00:03:50.440> Federalist<00:03:51.070> rate<00:03:51.220> and<00:03:51.370> would

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:51.460 
I've got a Federalist rate and would

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.770 
I've got a Federalist rate and would
have<00:03:51.550> been<00:03:51.670> towed<00:03:51.880> in<00:03:52.000> anyway<00:03:52.240> so<00:03:52.300> you<00:03:52.570> know

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
have been towed in anyway so you know

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.010 
have been towed in anyway so you know
it's<00:03:52.980> difficult<00:03:53.980> to<00:03:54.250> the<00:03:54.790> block<00:03:55.210> to<00:03:55.420> defend

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.020 
it's difficult to the block to defend

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.900 
it's difficult to the block to defend
now<00:03:56.110> and<00:03:56.350> this<00:03:56.470> is<00:03:56.710> where<00:03:56.890> he<00:03:57.130> set<00:03:57.460> up<00:03:57.670> for<00:03:57.700> the

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
now and this is where he set up for the
