00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:22.470
 heartfelt greetings to you black rose 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.439
 we are back in the sky again talk about the Yak-9 at 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.220
 you more accurately continue our story Alps and 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.890
 let's see what we can in the top 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:36.120
 accordingly, we have already seen the option 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:39.390
 frontal s84 and he never expected it 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.520
 for him will not be fatal went to the forehead 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.670
 not knowing that I have two twenties one 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.280
 gun 37 millimeters to compare that 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.829
 it looks like yak-9 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.800
 except that we don't have 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.680
 maneuverability such as yak-9 t plus ko 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.440
 all at the Yak-9, no guns of these leaves 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.809
 we have two guns of 20 in general, then we have them 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.559
 we use not only as sighting 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.750
 although it is quite possible and not even worth it 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.289
 put hidden on them is quite normal 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.700
 can they shoot skis destroy 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:13.380
 37 millimeters well, actually 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.420
 of course the gun itself is 37 millimeters 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.490
 Perfect for destruction as 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.630
 fighters alike and bombers that 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.069
 we just saw without any problems 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.420
 stock tapes and I have to 

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:26.520
 twenty horseradish thirty seven 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.830
 millimeter cannon and I fly it without 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.590
 any problems and 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.780
 This video Well, let's go look plus 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.750
 what we have for the plane in the end stoppe 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.300
 and see what it is by the way wanted 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.630
 a little clarity with flotar and me 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:45.630
 everything is clear drains we flew with a partner 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.270
 several times we issued 830 820 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.459
 meters an hour flotar formed but 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.860
 somehow wore already thoroughly on it 

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:56.090
 rolling out a plane latrun mastering seven hundred 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.440
 fifty 760 manifests well in general 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.649
 any about this mystic 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.830
 let's go further and what we have on courses well 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:08.340
 powerful weapons have already noticed quite good 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.310
 ground speed well somewhere 560 565 we 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.380
 go katya in real life on the ground , we gave out 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.440
 578 well I would like to see the name 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.920
 it means 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:24.390
 we 're going around 560 at the afterburner who is 65 and 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.380
 about 540 we go without afterburner in principle 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.840
 not bad 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.000
 whatever one may say some types of aircraft 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.170
 We lose of course not everything is 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.670
 more imbovo you do well well 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.810
 let's see what else we have 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.420
 there is something interesting 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.060
 what to really make our plane 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.160
 quite good inherit overheating we 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.160
 I remember very well that it seems to be a plane 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.230
 may be nice and good about him 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.960
 armament is nothing but overheating 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.670
 the most interesting moment here we have this 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:57.090
 no fly by 100 percent thrust and 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.400
 of course we are not here to say so 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.310
 bind to this overheating factor and 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.820
 calmly we can act too but 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.670
 again, it should be noted that in general our 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:11.190
 the plane doesnâ€™t say email 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.990
 in no way is any we pretty 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.840
 such an average aircraft in all respects 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:18.390
 with good truth weapons somewhere we 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.950
 can imitate but in the same tag we 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.410
 let's say we lose with a spitfire 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.060
 losing who we fight on 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.660
 fourth grade despite the fact that we had 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.130
 the same as the shop 9 to what it 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.959
 did not know especially as shop 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.190
 post-war plane and we still 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.489
 managed to war 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:39.090
 we were let out in February forty-five 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:42.690
 and we fought there a lot over Berlin 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.300
 beat in general there were good 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.810
 development rate of only 2 or 3 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.850
 the aircraft was lost as it is so so 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.430
 which is not entirely correct to put this 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.590
 the plane is on a par with the shop and the 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.790
 more that the shop and the engine is more powerful at 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:02.970
 of us he is only one and a half thousand horses there 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.540
 1850 if I'm not mistaken and of course to us 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.549
 here 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.599
 hard to deal with such 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:11.969
 opponents like tags like 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:14.129
 the griffin series spitfiers of course 

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:15.840
 bust but one way or another you can and there 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:18.239
 to fight in general, then the plane is us 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.449
 will allow erius just need to remember in no 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:24.210
 in any case whether from forward and in 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:25.680
 in general, to fly without some kind of cover 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.500
 his came off the main group 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.660
 fighters and you go out yes and even 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.789
 if one normal fighter 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.710
 any opponent quite well with 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:37.470
 straight arms up from that for you so 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.810
 may end sadly in general 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.820
 the most important rule is not to go ahead 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.009
 keep a little behind the main forces 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:48.810
 Well, of course, but only as in stock 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:50.759
 help is something like this and according to our 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.580
 minus as i said what's really 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:57.660
 the plane he has average performance 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:59.849
 and so here is a straightforward simple bend on 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.949
 It will not be the aircraft probably longer 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:04.949
 fun but at the same time for people 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:06.810
 with straight arms or so he 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:09.780
 will make interesting interesting 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:12.090
 cons and of course use very 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.639
 bright and very correct our weapons 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:17.250
 still 30 millimeters universal 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:19.199
 weapons to destroy not beavers and 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.060
 fighter aircraft conventional and 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:24.539
 stormtroopers that just can not them 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:27.000
 destroy in general you will like and 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:30.360
 the plane that's why the kit 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.490
 weapons with a gun 45 millimeters i'm not 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:35.340
 became and the principle pump out I remember 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:38.070
 yak-9 coy he somehow did not like me but 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.560
 no one is a little bit mine that is there 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:44.190
 great ballistics from this and she doesn't 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:46.889
 liked here 37 to plus two guns by 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:49.680
 20 in general, then you can and guns 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:50.280
 shoot, too, by the way about our 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.430
 twenties 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:55.650
 very conveniently you can somewhere on some 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:58.080
 aisles not only 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.990
 our 37 meters and gun work namely 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:03.030
 20 points caught gave turn and 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:05.580
 principle could hurt anyone or 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:07.889
 replace pretty nice and comfortable 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:10.740
 saves 37 millimeters 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:13.199
 features if we have to first 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.090
 destroy cover bomber 

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:17.430
 time happens that comes a little 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.919
 Fortresses into battle and covers them 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:22.800
 fighter but so here first cleaned 

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:23.600
 lovers and then went to the beavers that's how 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.600
 so 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:30.150
 so that the plane is quite good but not 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.370
 most wonderful yes to them 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.000
 very very far away and I hope that was 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:36.650
 but still 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:41.370
 reduced to fall we will if we then 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:44.910
 co2 sixth maximum may be even lower 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:46.740
 Well, in general, I would not like too much 

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:48.930
 fall for all sorts of perks 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:51.539
 to any given frame easier steam 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:53.699
 apprenticeship in general well if 

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:56.340
 historically compare the plane with them 

00:06:53.699 --> 00:07:01.110
 Well, I could not at all somehow fight something 

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:05.230
 there are errors allowed fokker d 12 and 13 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:07.330
 up to 9 Americans are allowed 

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:09.340
 let the corsairs even later the series 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:12.340
 which are not yet put into play but banks 

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:16.000
 Allowed in general, something like this 

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:18.520
 Well in the end we get the average plane 

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.340
 with good weapons for those who love 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:22.300
 with names 30 millimeters for someone 

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:25.060
 maybe 45 

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.690
 swing fly and where the whole bend 

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.900
 successfully 

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:30.730
 something like this well Well liked the video 

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:32.440
 set like subscribe to channel not 

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.220
 I recommend videos to friends with you 

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.050
 say goodbye 

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:37.000
 by tradition I wish a clear sky and 

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:41.250
 good mood with you was black 

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.250
 cargo until new meetings bye
