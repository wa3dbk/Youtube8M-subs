course<00:04:45.410> I<00:04:45.670> didn't<00:04:46.670> ever<00:04:47.060> do<00:04:47.450> one<00:04:47.600> until<00:04:47.870> I<00:04:47.930> have

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
course I didn't ever do one until I have

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.160 
course I didn't ever do one until I have
17<00:04:48.500> so<00:04:48.680> I<00:04:48.710> kind<00:04:49.160> of<00:04:49.280> had<00:04:49.460> a<00:04:49.490> late<00:04:49.730> start<00:04:50.120> but<00:04:50.330> I

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.170 
17 so I kind of had a late start but I

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:52.870 
17 so I kind of had a late start but I
picked<00:04:51.680> it<00:04:51.830> up<00:04:51.890> pretty<00:04:51.950> quickly<00:04:52.490> and<00:04:52.790> it

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
picked it up pretty quickly and it

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.940 
picked it up pretty quickly and it
seemed<00:04:53.330> to<00:04:53.390> be<00:04:53.570> a<00:04:53.600> real<00:04:53.900> natural<00:04:54.410> thing<00:04:54.650> to<00:04:54.800> me

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
seemed to be a real natural thing to me

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.190 
seemed to be a real natural thing to me
and<00:04:55.130> I<00:04:55.340> got<00:04:55.670> so<00:04:56.030> much<00:04:56.240> excitement<00:04:56.630> from<00:04:56.900> it<00:04:57.080> the

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200
