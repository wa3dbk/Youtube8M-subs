00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:35.070 
like brand-new now you can only do that
maybe<00:06:32.390> depend<00:06:33.020> on<00:06:33.110> the<00:06:33.200> quality<00:06:33.350> of<00:06:33.590> the<00:06:33.710> hair

maybe depend on the quality of the hair

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.240 
maybe depend on the quality of the hair
but<00:06:36.080> my<00:06:36.200> side<00:06:36.380> secrets<00:06:36.770> I<00:06:36.860> did<00:06:37.010> throughout<00:06:37.160> the

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:37.250 
but my side secrets I did throughout the

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:38.530 
but my side secrets I did throughout the
year<00:06:37.490> so<00:06:37.520> I<00:06:37.700> can't<00:06:37.940> even<00:06:38.000> tell<00:06:38.270> you<00:06:38.300> how<00:06:38.390> many

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:38.540 
year so I can't even tell you how many

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.330 
year so I can't even tell you how many
times<00:06:38.720> I<00:06:38.960> put<00:06:39.140> a<00:06:39.170> chi<00:06:39.380> iron<00:06:39.560> to<00:06:39.770> that<00:06:39.920> with<00:06:40.130> this

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:40.340 
times I put a chi iron to that with this

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.300 
times I put a chi iron to that with this
one<00:06:40.610> I<00:06:40.850> play<00:06:41.060> chair<00:06:41.300> into<00:06:41.600> twice<00:06:41.870> and<00:06:42.310> that's

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:43.310 
one I play chair into twice and that's

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:44.940 
one I play chair into twice and that's
physical<00:06:43.670> only<00:06:43.820> worn<00:06:44.090> it<00:06:44.240> like<00:06:44.390> three<00:06:44.600> times

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:44.950 
physical only worn it like three times

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:49.930 
physical only worn it like three times
so<00:06:47.320> I'd<00:06:48.320> let<00:06:48.560> you<00:06:48.740> know<00:06:48.920> that<00:06:49.160> you<00:06:49.250> can<00:06:49.400> least<00:06:49.700> I

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:49.940 
so I'd let you know that you can least I

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.580 
so I'd let you know that you can least I
think<00:06:50.060> with<00:06:50.420> this<00:06:50.540> hair<00:06:50.810> can<00:06:50.960> probably<00:06:51.320> do<00:06:51.530> it

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:51.590 
think with this hair can probably do it

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:53.800 
think with this hair can probably do it
maybe<00:06:51.890> 10<00:06:52.190> more<00:06:52.370> times<00:06:52.580> I<00:06:52.910> think<00:06:52.970> after<00:06:53.300> that<00:06:53.630> I

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:53.810 
maybe 10 more times I think after that I

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:55.750 
maybe 10 more times I think after that I
will<00:06:53.870> probably<00:06:54.320> have<00:06:54.440> to<00:06:54.470> cut<00:06:54.830> it<00:06:54.860> and<00:06:55.220> it's

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:55.760 
will probably have to cut it and it's

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.580 
will probably have to cut it and it's
already<00:06:56.120> 22<00:06:56.390> inches<00:06:56.750> and<00:06:56.990> poly<00:06:57.170> for<00:06:57.380> me<00:06:57.470> to

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:57.590 
already 22 inches and poly for me to

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.560 
already 22 inches and poly for me to
rock<00:06:57.770> it<00:06:57.800> like<00:06:58.370> just<00:06:58.640> straight<00:06:58.910> down<00:06:58.970> I'm

00:06:59.560 --> 00:06:59.570 
rock it like just straight down I'm

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:01.120 
rock it like just straight down I'm
probably<00:07:00.020> going<00:07:00.230> to<00:07:00.320> have<00:07:00.380> a<00:07:00.440> style<00:07:00.740> to<00:07:00.980> my

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.130 
probably going to have a style to my

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:06.100 
probably going to have a style to my
face<00:07:01.370> so<00:07:02.060> this<00:07:02.180> is<00:07:02.210> because<00:07:02.600> I<00:07:02.630> actually<00:07:03.100> put
