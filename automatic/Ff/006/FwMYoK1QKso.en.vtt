00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:09.200
 Compare 156.378 and 156.348. 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.800
 I assume they do not ask which one of them is bigger. 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:20.400
 Let's rewrite the numbers: 156.378 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.400
 and we want to compare it with 156,348 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.200
 I will do it step by step, even if it is clear to you if it is not for you. 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:39.800
 Let's see the hundreds. 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:47.000
 The one in the hundreds of numbers shows how many hundreds we have. 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 We have 1 for the number of hundreds in both numbers. 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 Let's see the dozens. We have 5 decades, which is 50. 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:06.200
 In both numbers, we have 5 decimal places. Are the same. 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.800
 We go to the units. We have 6 units 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.400
 in both numbers, i. are equal again. 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.200
 We go to the tenths. 3 tenths in both numbers. 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:27.200
 What about hundreds? We have 7 hundredths 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.400
 in the first and 4th in the second. 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.800
 The second number has less than a hundredths. Let's see the thousands. 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.800
 They are the same, but it would not matter, even if they were different, 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.200
 because hundreds are different. And hundreds are more important. 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:52.400
 7&gt; 4, i. 7 hundreds is more than 4 hundredths. 

00:01:52.400 --> 99:59:59.999
 And then 156,378&gt; 156,348
