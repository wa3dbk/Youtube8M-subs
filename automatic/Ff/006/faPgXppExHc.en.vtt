00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:08.300
 dear friends today in charge kitchen with 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.710
 taste let's give one of our tricks 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.860
 essential to make a good egg 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.860
 poached 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.720
 Y 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:28.170
 for this we have a saucepan where we have 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.759
 the water put a splash of vinegar 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.640
 so that the clear one is collected well in the 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.950
 egg and come out super closed and a 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.230
 little bit of salt there we let it cook 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.750
 meanwhile in a separate pan 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.239
 let's put some butter 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.680
 luca with good salt how good is the 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.010
 butter light for like that in pill 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.260
 is that in the packaging on paper you 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.460
 puts the grammages as he does this 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.950
 cut 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.920
 then we put there if you cut here 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:59.290
 we would put 25 grams which is what 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.160
 we need to make the sauce once 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.710
 let the melted butter be 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.950
 we add the cream 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.340
 and we put a touch of salt 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:14.010
 we are going to use a pepper cheese 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:16.170
 in castelo add the cheese in cubes 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.630
 let's reduce it little by little 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.000
 while it is going to us 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.670
 let's climb the egg we let it fall 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.520
 from above to wrap it up 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.520
 we remove it with absorbent paper 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:36.020
 now salsita we take it out of the fire 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.820
 we put the salsita on the bottom of the plate 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.400
 and now we place our egg is 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.920
 short we ended up with a droplet of 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.150
 oil and here we would have today our 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.190
