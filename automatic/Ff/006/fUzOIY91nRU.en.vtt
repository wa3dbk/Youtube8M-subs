00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
cornering tool are the edge tool it

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.590 
cornering tool are the edge tool it
leaves<00:03:18.600> a<00:03:18.660> nice<00:03:18.780> rounded<00:03:19.230> edge<00:03:19.970> and<00:03:20.970> there<00:03:21.510> are

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
leaves a nice rounded edge and there are

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.450 
leaves a nice rounded edge and there are
other<00:03:21.750> little<00:03:22.170> things<00:03:22.410> to<00:03:22.770> smooth<00:03:23.040> out<00:03:23.250> all

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
other little things to smooth out all

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.280 
other little things to smooth out all
the<00:03:23.670> ripples<00:03:24.060> and<00:03:24.210> stuff<00:03:24.620> make<00:03:25.620> it<00:03:25.650> look<00:03:25.860> nice

the ripples and stuff make it look nice
and<00:03:28.290> then<00:03:28.980> a<00:03:29.040> little<00:03:29.280> while<00:03:29.400> and<00:03:29.730> it's<00:03:29.910> hard

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
and then a little while and it's hard

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.180 
and then a little while and it's hard
enough<00:03:30.180> to<00:03:30.510> stand<00:03:30.900> on<00:03:31.140> they'll<00:03:31.530> hit<00:03:31.980> it<00:03:32.100> with

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
enough to stand on they'll hit it with

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.360 
enough to stand on they'll hit it with
the<00:03:32.220> power<00:03:32.490> trowel<00:03:32.880> and<00:03:33.830> I'll<00:03:34.830> catch<00:03:35.010> that<00:03:35.250> on

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
the power trowel and I'll catch that on

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.190 
the power trowel and I'll catch that on
film<00:03:35.580> those<00:03:35.880> are<00:03:36.030> backed<00:03:36.810> up<00:03:36.900> straighter

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
film those are backed up straighter

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.740 
film those are backed up straighter
still<00:03:37.530> right<00:03:37.710> now<00:03:37.860> though

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.300 

hella<00:03:42.750> concrete<00:03:43.230> set<00:03:43.410> up<00:03:43.530> enough<00:03:43.770> to<00:03:43.890> walk<00:03:44.070> on

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
hella concrete set up enough to walk on

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.290 
hella concrete set up enough to walk on
so<00:03:44.490> we<00:03:44.580> get<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:44.880> power<00:03:45.030> barrel<00:03:45.450> on<00:03:45.600> it<00:03:47.300> and

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
so we get the power barrel on it and

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.320 
so we get the power barrel on it and
finish<00:03:48.990> the<00:03:49.110> surface<00:03:49.700> when<00:03:50.700> it<00:03:50.790> starts<00:03:51.090> if<00:03:51.240> you

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
finish the surface when it starts if you

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.620 
finish the surface when it starts if you
can<00:03:51.510> play<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:51.780> kind<00:03:51.990> of<00:03:52.140> flat<00:03:53.420> then<00:03:54.420> if<00:03:54.540> you

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
can play the kind of flat then if you

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.400 
can play the kind of flat then if you
need<00:03:54.810> to<00:03:55.110> you<00:03:55.320> can<00:03:55.640> think<00:03:56.930> it<00:03:57.930> is<00:03:58.140> adjustable

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
need to you can think it is adjustable

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.260 
need to you can think it is adjustable
you<00:03:58.890> can<00:03:59.010> adjust<00:03:59.160> the<00:03:59.430> pitch<00:03:59.610> on<00:03:59.820> the<00:03:59.940> plates

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
you can adjust the pitch on the plates

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.990 
you can adjust the pitch on the plates
and<00:04:00.600> they<00:04:00.720> can<00:04:00.870> go<00:04:01.050> up<00:04:01.170> a<00:04:01.200> little<00:04:01.380> cheaper<00:04:02.000> what

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
and they can go up a little cheaper what

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:28.310 
and they can go up a little cheaper what
the<00:04:03.120> context<00:04:03.540> is<00:04:03.660> real<00:04:03.930> hard

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.300 

going<00:04:29.320> ok<00:04:31.289> they're<00:04:32.289> all<00:04:32.500> done<00:04:32.800> and<00:04:33.160> they're

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
going ok they're all done and they're

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.050 
going ok they're all done and they're
all<00:04:33.460> gone<00:04:33.840> and<00:04:34.840> it's<00:04:35.050> just<00:04:35.259> me<00:04:35.410> now<00:04:36.060> I'll

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
all gone and it's just me now I'll

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.969 
all gone and it's just me now I'll
probably<00:04:37.330> hang<00:04:37.630> around<00:04:37.780> the<00:04:38.560> rest<00:04:38.710> of<00:04:38.800> the<00:04:38.949> day

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:38.979 
probably hang around the rest of the day

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:43.920 
probably hang around the rest of the day
to<00:04:39.900> keep<00:04:40.900> it<00:04:41.080> missed<00:04:41.320> it<00:04:41.470> down<00:04:41.650> and<00:04:41.860> wet<00:04:42.930> to

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
to keep it missed it down and wet to

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.490 
to keep it missed it down and wet to
keep<00:04:44.199> it<00:04:44.320> as<00:04:44.470> cool<00:04:44.710> as<00:04:44.889> possible<00:04:46.080> so<00:04:47.080> it<00:04:47.229> can

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
keep it as cool as possible so it can

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.920 
keep it as cool as possible so it can
cure<00:04:48.009> up<00:04:48.190> nice<00:04:48.490> and<00:04:48.520> even<00:04:49.060> not<00:04:49.539> get<00:04:49.720> any

really worried that
it<00:05:02.930> would<00:05:03.080> use<00:05:03.259> a<00:05:03.289> lot<00:05:03.530> more<00:05:03.560> concrete<00:05:04.250> than

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
it would use a lot more concrete than

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.330 
it would use a lot more concrete than
normal<00:05:04.879> because<00:05:05.030> of<00:05:05.479> my<00:05:05.629> beam<00:05:05.870> seems<00:05:06.289> wise<00:05:06.889> and

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
normal because of my beam seems wise and

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.200 
normal because of my beam seems wise and
everything

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.559 

pretty<00:05:21.630> wide<00:05:21.840> maybe<00:05:22.319> too<00:05:22.560> deep<00:05:22.800> I<00:05:23.569> didn't

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:24.569 
pretty wide maybe too deep I didn't

believe<00:05:24.750> them<00:05:24.810> in<00:05:25.080> our<00:05:25.169> 49<00:05:25.889> yards<00:05:26.660> what<00:05:27.660> I

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
believe them in our 49 yards what I

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.040 
believe them in our 49 yards what I
ended<00:05:27.990> up<00:05:28.110> with<00:05:28.970> is<00:05:29.970> about<00:05:30.389> a<00:05:30.419> four<00:05:30.840> hundred

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050
