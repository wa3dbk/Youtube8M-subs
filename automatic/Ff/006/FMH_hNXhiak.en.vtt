Rocco world cup okay that actually one

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:10.820 
Rocco world cup okay that actually one
of<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:09.960> first<00:00:10.110> things<00:00:10.260> you<00:00:10.320> want<00:00:10.410> to<00:00:10.500> look<00:00:10.650> at

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
of the first things you want to look at

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.490 
of the first things you want to look at
is<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:12.059> preload<00:00:14.210> I<00:00:15.210> usually<00:00:16.109> back<00:00:16.350> the

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
is the the preload I usually back the

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.420 
is the the preload I usually back the
freeload<00:00:16.859> off<00:00:22.039> right<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.189> where<00:00:23.310> it's

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
freeload off right to where it's

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.720 
freeload off right to where it's
basically<00:00:24.050> like<00:00:25.050> loose<00:00:25.910> and<00:00:27.890> the<00:00:28.890> maximum

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
basically like loose and the maximum

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.620 
basically like loose and the maximum
amount<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:30.179> preload<00:00:30.480> Tom<00:00:31.080> any<00:00:31.949> spring<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.700> only

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
amount of preload Tom any spring is only

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.130 
amount of preload Tom any spring is only
about<00:00:33.780> four<00:00:34.079> millimeters<00:00:34.620> so<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:35.940> usually<00:00:36.780> take

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
about four millimeters so I usually take

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:45.260 
about four millimeters so I usually take
it<00:00:37.700> and<00:00:38.870> I'll<00:00:39.870> do<00:00:40.079> 3<00:00:41.059> full<00:00:42.059> turns<00:00:43.160> and<00:00:44.180> then<00:00:45.180> I

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
it and I'll do 3 full turns and then I

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.000 
it and I'll do 3 full turns and then I
start<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.840> start<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.260> check<00:00:46.440> your<00:00:46.620> rebound

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
start to I start to check your rebound

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.440 
start to I start to check your rebound
and<00:00:47.309> this<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.610> something<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:47.969> actually<00:00:48.090> want

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
and this is something you actually want

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.299 
and this is something you actually want
to<00:00:48.510> when<00:00:49.170> you're<00:00:49.260> adjusting<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.739> rebound<00:00:50.070> on

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
have the the rear end just a little bit

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.539 
have the the rear end just a little bit
faster<00:01:06.450> actually<00:01:06.720> I'm<00:01:07.590> going<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.010> change<00:01:08.100> that

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
faster actually I'm going to change that

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.719 
faster actually I'm going to change that
up<00:01:08.610> depending<00:01:09.180> on<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.330> on<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.659> terrain

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
up depending on the on the terrain

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.039 
up depending on the on the terrain
sometimes<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:11.850> want<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.060> front<00:01:12.299> end<00:01:12.479> you

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
sometimes you want the front end you

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.140 
sometimes you want the front end you
know<00:01:13.200> at<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.710> same<00:01:13.860> bar<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.070> rebound<00:01:14.369> as<00:01:14.520> the

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
know at the same bar the rebound as the

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.060 
know at the same bar the rebound as the
the<00:01:15.540> rear<00:01:15.810> end<00:01:16.020> sometimes<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.650> want<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.830> rear

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
the rear end sometimes you want the rear

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.350 
the rear end sometimes you want the rear
end<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.310> little<00:01:17.490> bit<00:01:17.580> slower<00:01:17.820> than<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.060> front

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
end a little bit slower than the front

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.510 
end a little bit slower than the front
end<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:19.439> just<00:01:19.470> depends<00:01:20.189> on<00:01:20.250> what<00:01:20.369> you're

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
end it just depends on what you're

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.940 
end it just depends on what you're
dealing<00:01:20.700> with<00:01:21.200> the<00:01:22.200> terrain<00:01:22.439> you're<00:01:22.650> dealing

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
dealing with the terrain you're dealing

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.359 
dealing with the terrain you're dealing
with<00:01:22.979> but<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.850> rider<00:01:24.060> you're<00:01:24.299> dealing<00:01:24.600> with

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
with but the rider you're dealing with

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.249 
with but the rider you're dealing with
there's<00:01:26.299> a<00:01:26.390> couple<00:01:26.600> different<00:01:26.689> you<00:01:27.109> know

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
there's a couple different you know

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:28.599 
there's a couple different you know
scenarios<00:01:27.710> that<00:01:27.859> you<00:01:28.009> might<00:01:28.189> have<00:01:28.310> to<00:01:28.460> play

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:28.609 
scenarios that you might have to play

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:31.749 
scenarios that you might have to play
with<00:01:29.109> this<00:01:30.109> is<00:01:30.350> your<00:01:30.770> compression<00:01:31.189> adjuster

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
with this is your compression adjuster

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.440 
with this is your compression adjuster
the<00:01:33.369> rebound<00:01:34.369> is<00:01:34.490> located<00:01:34.880> on<00:01:34.969> the<00:01:35.119> on<00:01:35.299> the

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
the rebound is located on the on the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.630 
the rebound is located on the on the
back<00:01:35.659> eyelet<00:01:36.079> here<00:01:36.259> so<00:01:37.039> you<00:01:37.130> can<00:01:37.280> see<00:01:37.429> it<00:01:37.520> right

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
back eyelet here so you can see it right

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.090 
back eyelet here so you can see it right
there<00:01:39.340> so<00:01:40.340> let's<00:01:40.549> give<00:01:40.759> it<00:01:40.909> a<00:01:42.069> really<00:01:43.069> good

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
there so let's give it a really good

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.209 
there so let's give it a really good
amount<00:01:43.429> of<00:01:43.579> rebound<00:01:43.939> here<00:01:47.950> if<00:01:48.950> see<00:01:49.100> it's

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:49.219 
amount of rebound here if see it's

00:01:49.219 --> 00:02:00.399 
amount of rebound here if see it's
slowing<00:01:49.459> down

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.209 

so<00:02:00.890> that's<00:02:01.069> that's<00:02:01.460> really<00:02:01.729> dramatic<00:02:03.130> you<00:02:04.130> can

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:04.219 
so that's that's really dramatic you can

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:06.039 
so that's that's really dramatic you can
actually<00:02:04.340> see<00:02:04.640> how<00:02:04.759> slow<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.329> shock<00:02:05.899> is

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
actually see how slow the shock is

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.520 
actually see how slow the shock is
returning<00:02:06.380> you<00:02:06.740> know<00:02:06.859> through<00:02:07.850> the<00:02:07.969> stroke<00:02:08.530> so

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
returning you know through the stroke so

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.839 
returning you know through the stroke so
what<00:02:09.619> I<00:02:09.679> do<00:02:09.739> is<00:02:09.890> I<00:02:09.950> start<00:02:10.009> to<00:02:10.280> open<00:02:10.489> it<00:02:10.580> up<00:02:10.670> about

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
what I do is I start to open it up about

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:17.979 
what I do is I start to open it up about
four<00:02:13.849> to<00:02:14.150> five<00:02:14.180> clicks<00:02:14.780> and<00:02:15.260> then<00:02:16.160> test<00:02:16.549> it<00:02:16.989> you

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
four to five clicks and then test it you

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.270 
four to five clicks and then test it you
can<00:02:18.110> test<00:02:18.290> it<00:02:18.440> in<00:02:18.530> between<00:02:18.799> the<00:02:18.950> four<00:02:19.099> five

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
can test it in between the four five

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:26.700 
can test it in between the four five
clicks<00:02:19.489> you<00:02:19.549> can<00:02:19.670> go<00:02:19.730> two<00:02:19.849> or<00:02:19.970> three<00:02:20.209> clicks

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.690 

so<00:02:27.570> right<00:02:28.570> about<00:02:28.720> work<00:02:29.280> you<00:02:30.280> think<00:02:30.490> it's<00:02:30.610> gonna

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
so right about work you think it's gonna

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.760 
so right about work you think it's gonna
feel<00:02:30.970> comfortable<00:02:31.150> on<00:02:31.570> on<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:32.410> trail<00:02:32.620> that

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
feel comfortable on on the trail that

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:44.390 
feel comfortable on on the trail that
you're<00:02:32.890> writing

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:52.729 

so<00:02:44.970> right<00:02:45.180> there<00:02:46.519> check<00:02:47.519> the<00:02:47.640> fork<00:02:51.739> it's

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
so right there check the fork it's

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.350 
so right there check the fork it's
pretty<00:02:53.010> level<00:02:53.220> look<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.730> rear<00:02:53.909> is<00:02:54.030> a<00:02:54.060> little

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
pretty level look the rear is a little

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.490 
pretty level look the rear is a little
bit<00:02:54.450> slower<00:02:54.750> so<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:55.080> know<00:02:55.170> you're<00:02:55.290> not<00:02:55.379> going

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
bit slower so you know you're not going

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.610 
bit slower so you know you're not going
to<00:02:55.590> get<00:02:55.680> bucked<00:02:55.920> off<00:02:56.069> of<00:02:56.280> anything<00:02:57.349> you<00:02:58.349> speed

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
to get bucked off of anything you speed

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.119 
to get bucked off of anything you speed
it<00:02:58.739> up<00:02:58.860> just<00:02:58.890> a<00:02:59.129> little<00:02:59.159> bit<00:02:59.459> more<00:03:01.010> keep<00:03:02.010> the

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
it up just a little bit more keep the

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:05.390 
it up just a little bit more keep the
Viking<00:03:02.400> control<00:03:02.760> and<00:03:03.799> then<00:03:04.799> you<00:03:04.950> have<00:03:05.129> your

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
Viking control and then you have your

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.399 
Viking control and then you have your
compression<00:03:08.150> compression<00:03:09.150> on<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:10.079> on<00:03:10.260> the

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:10.409 
compression compression on the on the

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:13.940 
compression compression on the on the
shock<00:03:10.730> just<00:03:11.730> like<00:03:11.849> before<00:03:12.560> don't<00:03:13.560> have<00:03:13.709> use<00:03:13.920> it

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
shock just like before don't have use it

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.009 
shock just like before don't have use it
you<00:03:14.760> know<00:03:14.849> keep<00:03:15.060> it<00:03:15.180> wide<00:03:15.390> open<00:03:15.420> when<00:03:15.840> you<00:03:15.900> know

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
you know keep it wide open when you know

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.610 
you know keep it wide open when you know
you're<00:03:16.170> on<00:03:16.200> a<00:03:16.560> really<00:03:17.099> fast<00:03:17.400> section<00:03:18.620> maybe

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
you're on a really fast section maybe

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.390 
you're on a really fast section maybe
you<00:03:20.010> know<00:03:20.160> one<00:03:20.489> to<00:03:20.730> two<00:03:20.940> clicks<00:03:21.209> at<00:03:21.390> a<00:03:21.420> time

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
you know one to two clicks at a time

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.130 
you know one to two clicks at a time
unlike<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.519> fork<00:03:23.760> you<00:03:24.180> can<00:03:24.480> play<00:03:24.930> with<00:03:25.079> the

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
unlike the fork you can play with the

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.440 
unlike the fork you can play with the
compression<00:03:25.620> on<00:03:25.739> your<00:03:26.220> shock<00:03:26.549> a<00:03:26.579> lot<00:03:26.910> more<00:03:27.120> and

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
compression on your shock a lot more and

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.089 
compression on your shock a lot more and
you're<00:03:27.660> not<00:03:28.049> going<00:03:28.200> to<00:03:28.260> feel<00:03:28.410> the<00:03:28.560> harshness

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
you're not going to feel the harshness

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:30.940 
you're not going to feel the harshness
of<00:03:29.250> it<00:03:29.549> right<00:03:29.730> away

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
of it right away

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.270 
of it right away
so<00:03:31.950> for<00:03:32.129> bigger<00:03:32.310> hits<00:03:33.319> this<00:03:34.319> harder<00:03:34.680> hits<00:03:34.890> a

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
so for bigger hits this harder hits a

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.699 
so for bigger hits this harder hits a
big<00:03:36.060> drop<00:03:36.359> stuff<00:03:36.690> like<00:03:36.840> that<00:03:37.049> you<00:03:37.530> know<00:03:37.560> you

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
big drop stuff like that you know you

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.430 
big drop stuff like that you know you
have<00:03:37.890> a<00:03:37.920> little<00:03:38.190> a<00:03:38.220> little<00:03:38.840> more<00:03:39.840> range<00:03:40.260> of

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
have a little a little more range of

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.149 
have a little a little more range of
adjustability<00:03:40.829> to<00:03:41.159> play<00:03:41.430> with<00:03:42.769> you<00:03:43.769> do<00:03:43.980> have

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 
adjustability to play with you do have

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:46.910 
adjustability to play with you do have
the<00:03:44.340> air<00:03:44.549> chamber<00:03:44.849> here<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.599> minimum<00:03:46.079> is<00:03:46.230> 170

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
the air chamber here the minimum is 170

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.539 
the air chamber here the minimum is 170
and<00:03:47.040> the<00:03:47.129> maximum<00:03:47.700> is<00:03:47.909> 220<00:03:49.040> you<00:03:50.040> know<00:03:50.160> so<00:03:50.340> for<00:03:50.519> a

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
and the maximum is 220 you know so for a

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.330 
and the maximum is 220 you know so for a
lighter<00:03:50.849> Rider<00:03:51.470> you<00:03:52.470> can<00:03:52.620> you<00:03:52.859> can<00:03:53.010> run<00:03:53.220> that

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
lighter Rider you can you can run that

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.539 
lighter Rider you can you can run that
hundred<00:03:53.639> and<00:03:53.760> seventy<00:03:54.150> psi<00:03:54.780> and<00:03:55.310> not<00:03:56.310> have<00:03:56.430> to

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
hundred and seventy psi and not have to

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.190 
hundred and seventy psi and not have to
worry<00:03:56.730> about<00:03:56.819> you<00:03:57.269> know<00:03:57.389> that<00:03:57.540> that<00:03:57.750> chamber

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
worry about you know that that chamber

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.530 
worry about you know that that chamber
bottoming<00:03:58.680> out<00:03:58.799> or<00:03:58.980> anything<00:03:59.160> I'm<00:04:00.150> a<00:04:00.269> heavier

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
bottoming out or anything I'm a heavier

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.500 
bottoming out or anything I'm a heavier
rider<00:04:00.870> you<00:04:01.739> can<00:04:01.769> run<00:04:02.069> you<00:04:02.400> can<00:04:02.430> run<00:04:02.549> that<00:04:02.849> 220

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
rider you can run you can run that 220

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.619 
rider you can run you can run that 220
you<00:04:04.500> know<00:04:04.590> maximum<00:04:04.889> psi<00:04:05.430> and<00:04:05.730> that's

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
you know maximum psi and that's

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:08.750 
you know maximum psi and that's
basically<00:04:07.440> where<00:04:07.680> you<00:04:07.799> want<00:04:08.190> to<00:04:08.310> keep<00:04:08.489> that

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
basically where you want to keep that

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.759 
basically where you want to keep that
it's<00:04:09.269> not<00:04:09.540> like<00:04:09.720> you<00:04:09.900> want<00:04:10.109> to<00:04:10.230> you<00:04:10.440> know<00:04:10.560> sit

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
it's not like you want to you know sit

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.460 
it's not like you want to you know sit
there<00:04:10.889> mess<00:04:11.190> with<00:04:11.340> this<00:04:11.459> chamber<00:04:12.470> another

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
there mess with this chamber another

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.319 
there mess with this chamber another
thing<00:04:13.799> with<00:04:14.069> with<00:04:14.370> this<00:04:14.519> air<00:04:14.699> chamber<00:04:15.000> is<00:04:15.150> when

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
thing with with this air chamber is when

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:16.819 
thing with with this air chamber is when
you<00:04:15.480> are<00:04:15.690> playing<00:04:15.720> with<00:04:16.260> that<00:04:16.440> air<00:04:16.590> pressure

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
you are playing with that air pressure

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.640 
you are playing with that air pressure
you<00:04:17.280> you<00:04:18.150> want<00:04:18.299> to<00:04:18.359> be<00:04:18.419> careful<00:04:18.720> with<00:04:19.500> the

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
you you want to be careful with the

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.730 
you you want to be careful with the
pumps<00:04:19.949> that<00:04:20.099> you<00:04:20.220> use<00:04:21.349> try<00:04:22.349> to<00:04:22.410> look<00:04:22.560> for<00:04:22.590> a

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
pumps that you use try to look for a

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.590 
pumps that you use try to look for a
pump<00:04:22.949> at<00:04:23.039> about<00:04:23.190> a<00:04:23.220> 250<00:04:23.970> psi<00:04:24.300> gauge

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
pump at about a 250 psi gauge

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.490 
pump at about a 250 psi gauge
and<00:04:25.720> that's<00:04:26.260> usually<00:04:26.740> the<00:04:26.950> best<00:04:27.160> option<00:04:28.500> as

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
and that's usually the best option as

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.900 
and that's usually the best option as
far<00:04:29.710> as<00:04:29.800> the<00:04:29.920> calibration<00:04:30.430> of<00:04:30.520> the<00:04:30.580> gauge<00:04:30.760> is

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
far as the calibration of the gauge is

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.320 
far as the calibration of the gauge is
concerned<00:04:31.300> and<00:04:31.980> when<00:04:32.980> you<00:04:33.250> pull<00:04:33.850> the<00:04:33.940> pump<00:04:34.150> off

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
concerned and when you pull the pump off

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.840 
concerned and when you pull the pump off
and<00:04:34.570> then<00:04:34.720> put<00:04:35.290> the<00:04:35.350> pump<00:04:35.560> back<00:04:35.590> on<00:04:35.950> you'll

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
and then put the pump back on you'll

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.390 
and then put the pump back on you'll
notice<00:04:37.030> that<00:04:37.300> you<00:04:37.840> know<00:04:37.960> the<00:04:38.190> gauge<00:04:39.190> will

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
notice that you know the gauge will

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.690 
notice that you know the gauge will
actually<00:04:39.670> read<00:04:39.910> differently<00:04:40.950> if<00:04:41.950> that's<00:04:42.250> not

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
actually read differently if that's not

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.210 
actually read differently if that's not
the<00:04:43.510> shock<00:04:43.750> leaking<00:04:44.140> here<00:04:44.380> that's<00:04:45.010> actually

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
the shock leaking here that's actually

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.480 
the shock leaking here that's actually
the<00:04:45.610> shock<00:04:46.530> charging<00:04:47.530> the<00:04:47.860> unit<00:04:47.890> it's<00:04:48.190> usually

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
the shock charging the unit it's usually

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.730 
the shock charging the unit it's usually
air<00:04:48.790> from<00:04:48.910> the<00:04:49.030> shock<00:04:49.270> to<00:04:49.510> charge<00:04:49.750> the<00:04:49.930> pump<00:04:50.170> so

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
air from the shock to charge the pump so

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.680 
air from the shock to charge the pump so
it<00:04:50.830> actually<00:04:51.160> changes<00:04:51.880> it<00:04:52.000> up<00:04:52.120> sometimes<00:04:52.510> by

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
it actually changes it up sometimes by

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.500 
it actually changes it up sometimes by
about<00:04:52.840> 30<00:04:53.140> psi<00:04:53.520> but<00:04:54.520> that<00:04:54.910> does<00:04:55.120> not<00:04:55.150> mean<00:04:55.480> that

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
about 30 psi but that does not mean that

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.140 
about 30 psi but that does not mean that
the<00:04:55.920> piggyback<00:04:56.920> is<00:04:57.190> leaking<00:04:57.520> air<00:04:57.730> it's<00:04:57.910> just

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
the piggyback is leaking air it's just

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.540 
the piggyback is leaking air it's just
the<00:04:58.470> air<00:04:59.470> pressure<00:04:59.710> in<00:04:59.860> the<00:04:59.950> shock<00:05:00.190> you<00:05:00.430> know

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
the air pressure in the shock you know

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.130 
the air pressure in the shock you know
charging<00:05:00.910> the<00:05:00.970> pump<00:05:01.180> you're<00:05:01.810> basically

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
charging the pump you're basically

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.510 
charging the pump you're basically
you're<00:05:02.260> playing<00:05:02.410> with<00:05:02.620> an<00:05:02.710> air<00:05:02.860> chamber<00:05:03.220> the

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
you're playing with an air chamber the

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.030 
you're playing with an air chamber the
size<00:05:03.730> of<00:05:03.880> a<00:05:03.970> fat<00:05:04.240> rate<00:05:04.720> so<00:05:05.200> just<00:05:05.890> take<00:05:06.010> that

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
size of a fat rate so just take that

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.530 
size of a fat rate so just take that
into<00:05:06.280> consideration<00:05:06.370> when<00:05:07.090> you<00:05:07.210> do<00:05:07.330> go<00:05:07.510> to

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
into consideration when you do go to

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.290 
into consideration when you do go to
check<00:05:07.810> your<00:05:07.960> air<00:05:08.080> pressure
