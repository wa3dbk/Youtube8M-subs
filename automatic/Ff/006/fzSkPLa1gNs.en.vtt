light is structured and what's really
cool<00:02:04.520> is<00:02:04.729> that<00:02:04.819> I<00:02:04.940> can<00:02:05.149> read<00:02:05.420> the<00:02:05.630> book<00:02:05.659> and

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
cool is that I can read the book and

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.609 
cool is that I can read the book and
also<00:02:06.830> annotate<00:02:07.250> directly<00:02:07.610> on<00:02:08.119> to<00:02:08.420> it<00:02:08.569> so<00:02:09.440> let

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
also annotate directly on to it so let

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.410 
also annotate directly on to it so let
me<00:02:09.649> go<00:02:09.799> into<00:02:09.950> pen<00:02:10.310> mode<00:02:10.549> and<00:02:10.850> I'm<00:02:11.150> going<00:02:11.330> to

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
me go into pen mode and I'm going to

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.800 
me go into pen mode and I'm going to
circle<00:02:11.569> light<00:02:12.049> waves<00:02:12.380> and<00:02:12.680> photons<00:02:13.610> and<00:02:13.910> write

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
circle light waves and photons and write

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.780 
circle light waves and photons and write
down<00:02:15.080> that<00:02:15.560> it<00:02:15.830> is<00:02:16.069> going<00:02:16.280> to<00:02:16.430> be<00:02:16.549> very

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
down that it is going to be very

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:23.430 
down that it is going to be very
important

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.020 

but<00:02:24.440> even<00:02:24.680> better<00:02:24.860> if<00:02:25.220> you<00:02:25.610> want<00:02:25.790> to<00:02:25.910> add

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
but even better if you want to add

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.730 
but even better if you want to add
additional<00:02:26.240> detail<00:02:26.930> you<00:02:27.110> can<00:02:27.200> create<00:02:27.470> notes

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
additional detail you can create notes

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.430 
additional detail you can create notes
with<00:02:28.670> us<00:02:28.850> know<00:02:29.060> from<00:02:29.510> within<00:02:29.810> learning<00:02:30.110> hub

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
with us know from within learning hub

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.860 
with us know from within learning hub
now<00:02:31.370> I'm<00:02:31.520> going<00:02:31.760> to<00:02:31.910> write<00:02:32.270> that<00:02:32.780> light<00:02:33.650> is

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
now I'm going to write that light is

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:46.540 
now I'm going to write that light is
made<00:02:35.870> of<00:02:36.220> waves<00:02:37.220> and<00:02:39.640> photons<00:02:45.070> so<00:02:46.070> hopefully

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
made of waves and photons so hopefully

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.520 
made of waves and photons so hopefully
you'll<00:02:46.730> have<00:02:46.910> a<00:02:46.940> bit<00:02:47.240> of<00:02:47.390> a<00:02:47.480> feel<00:02:47.780> for<00:02:48.080> how<00:02:48.260> easy

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
you'll have a bit of a feel for how easy

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.410 
you'll have a bit of a feel for how easy
and<00:02:48.770> fun<00:02:48.980> it<00:02:49.010> is<00:02:49.190> to<00:02:49.250> learn<00:02:49.640> with<00:02:49.940> the<00:02:49.970> Galaxy

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
and fun it is to learn with the Galaxy

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.870 
and fun it is to learn with the Galaxy
Note<00:02:50.570> 10.1<00:02:51.070> why<00:02:52.070> not<00:02:52.250> have<00:02:52.400> a<00:02:52.430> look<00:02:52.610> at<00:02:52.790> our

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
Note 10.1 why not have a look at our

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.640 
Note 10.1 why not have a look at our
other<00:02:53.000> videos<00:02:53.120> to<00:02:53.420> see<00:02:53.810> just<00:02:54.050> how<00:02:54.110> much<00:02:54.440> you

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
other videos to see just how much you

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.980 
other videos to see just how much you
can<00:02:54.680> do<00:02:54.950> with<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.490> new<00:02:55.700> Samsung<00:02:56.210> Galaxy<00:02:56.240> Note

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
can do with the new Samsung Galaxy Note

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.320 
can do with the new Samsung Galaxy Note
