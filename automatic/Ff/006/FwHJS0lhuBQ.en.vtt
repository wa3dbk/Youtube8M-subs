00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 Estimates assume that everyone 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.629
 Tenth Europeans once in a lifetime 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.700
 nail fungus has to fight and get 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.769
 Anyone can really get it anywhere 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.650
 Many people are traveling barefoot 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.400
 while bathing the dressing rooms or in 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.619
 the sauna 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.039
 The risk of infection is especially high 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.600
 if the nails are already damaged 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.460
 Too tight shoes make it the mushroom 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.130
 example easily einunisten 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.349
 he likes damp and warm food 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.439
 so to speak of the horn material of the nails 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.250
 If left untreated, keratin may be 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.050
 spread 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.120
 in a weakened immune system or 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.149
 bad blood circulation is fast 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.040
 the fungus typically stains the nail 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.100
 so slightly yellowish the patient sees 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.129
 often yourself and then forms the 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.590
 typical form of nail fungus it first 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.600
 in this area and then he can 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.370
 but if not treated well 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.610
 continue to express themselves 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.170
 for example, on the whole nail plate 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.149
 in particularly severe cases can 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.730
 then split off entire layers 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.010
 the nail will dissolve, so to speak 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.210
 crumbly the treatment is for the 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.040
 concerned a real jigsaw their 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.750
 school first tried the mushroom 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.450
 to get a grip on yourself 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.229
 There are many in the pharmacy 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.270
 nail fungus agent over-the-counter nail polish 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.180
 or different creams the nail 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.030
 something to solve so that the drug always 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.180
 an antifungal means penetrate better 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.180
 can 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.660
 alfi ready really the relatively good 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.790
 I have to say honestly no matter what 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.710
 then we will have found 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.360
 that if it is actually there once 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.910
 goes the nail polish is more effective because 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.160
 the people get along with it better 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.810
 the creams and some nail polishes need 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.970
 be applied daily 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.060
 other paints in larger temporal 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.700
 it is always the distances 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:58.610
 Patient discipline says pharmacist 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.960
 ingo behr so â€‹â€‹nail fungus relative 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.970
 persistent the patient he must 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.070
 tolerably good and it takes time 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.110
 even in the distance to four to six 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.780
 months it is a situation image has done 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.060
 Your school has self-therapy 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.240
 brought little to nothing 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.980
 her pils stayed there I think that at 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.810
 i was too advanced i am too 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.070
 late to go to the doctor finally it 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.220
 did not help anything 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.530
 I started creaming in nail polish 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.420
 and then I was at the dermatologist 's 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.610
 correct diagnosis by a specialist 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.310
 is suspected of nail fungus the 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.489
 most important step here in the lab will be 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:39.060
 nail tests on traces examined so 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:41.340
 called thread tietze rare yeast or 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.530
 Molds are the trigger of 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.270
 illness 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.640
 it depends on the pizza 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.350
 with which tablets or with 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.140
 which we treat as cream act 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.060
 different medications 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.310
 the fungus infestation is different 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.180
 very persistent or are already several 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.180
 looked after nails
