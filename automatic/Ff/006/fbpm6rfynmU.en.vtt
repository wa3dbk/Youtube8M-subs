 hello how about youtube friends talk to you 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.080
 and well, as you saw it at 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.270
 beginning of this video what are we going to 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.150
 learn is how to control the 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.760
 computer with some cell phone some 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.100
 device and makes a tablet even 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.860
 we can control the computer from 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.170
 another computer ok let's start 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.110
 with today's tutorial we're going to need 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.840
 a software called teamviewer this 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.660
 you find it internet to download it 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.200
 is free version does not charge of 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.850
 software just downloads it and a 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.350
 Once you download it, it will appear 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.850
 with the following icon that says 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.650
 teamviewer 9 we give a double click well in 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.090
 the part here shows us 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.750
 simply this part where is 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.080
 our 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.660
 Haitian and this is our password 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.150
 well we can see in this part 7 what 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:48.720
 The only thing we have to do is copy the 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:51.300
 air and paste it into our device at 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.530
 which we will control and equal 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:58.700
 way the password will ask us how 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.320
 we will see it in the next video 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.650
 well and as we can see here we are already 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.140
 on a device well and what we have 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.509
 what to download is the same program that 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.730
 download on the computer is the 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.030
 teamviewer and we can download it from 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.160
 marquette if you are using android and 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.320
 if you are using them you can 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.690
 download it from the app 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.000
 good store is completely free 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.370
 also and well once we have it 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.110
 downloaded what we are going to do is 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:33.840
 open it and it will look like in this case 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.420
 in this way the only thing that we have to 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.880
 to do is write the haiti of the 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.830
 computer that we will control in 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.190
 this case we write you with the numbers 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.980
 I am referring to this one 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:50.370
 This is the ied and this is what we are going to copy 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.260
 right to our device the 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.140
 we copy as we just did in 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:58.230
 these moments is the one who dares to 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.030
 copy from our computer and well a 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.239
 Once we have copied it, we will give 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:06.209
 remote control and is loading our 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:10.080
 application asks us for the password here 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:12.269
 the password is below the haiti and 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.670
 says one hundred percent password 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:17.040
 what we do is write the van to 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.260
 serve to move within 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.959
 our application to move what 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.030
 it would be our computer well as 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.910
 we can observe in the computer it 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:30.000
 reaches to observe that it goes black 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.940
 the configurations are lowered 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.910
 graphics so you can have higher 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.340
 speed at the time of charging then 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.069
 this is normal do not worry the background 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.440
 screen is changed to black, no 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:45.599
 worry that is normal and well then in 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.049
 this part here we're just going to give 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:51.569
 continue let's fix us already 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:54.730
 we can move from here I'm moving in 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:57.069
 the right part I'm moving 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.680
 if you notice, I'm moving it here 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:02.409
 is the mouse to realize and 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.049
 well here I am moving the 

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:07.239
 mouse this basically also serves 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:09.819
 to give remote access to 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:12.640
 computers in this case could also 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:14.830
 serve to draw in paint well here 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.829
 I'm in paint as we can see here 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:20.290
 on the tablet that can also be with 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:23.020
 a cell phone remember here I am 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.430
 in paint on our computer and good 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.820
 Well here what we can do is 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:30.940
 draw with or taking a brush some 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:34.180
 pencil and start drawing what 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:38.260
 we want with the ipad and this 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:42.160
 way is how it is moving here 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:44.590
 we can do this shot where is the 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.080
 application without the mouse and you're 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.270
 moving as we can see in 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.940
 this part of here 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:55.540
 this also serves us and gives us a chat 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:59.790
 which is also very very useful when it comes to 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.790
 be controlling our computer 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:08.440
 young there I sent him a chat and we 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:11.440
 comes in what would be the application of 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:14.380
 here well this is the software that is going 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.030
 to help control the computer to 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.970
 that we can do 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.200
 countless things in this part of here 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.530
 we can 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.630
 see transfer photos can also be 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:29.830
 transfer to any file it 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:32.890
 transfer from the ipad to the computer or 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.750
 from the computer to another computer and 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:37.380
 Well well this way it's like 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:40.060
 we can control our computer 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:42.670
