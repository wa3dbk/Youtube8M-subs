00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 actually needed the interrogation 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.500
 finally the analysis including metallurgical 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.860
 we will have to do is understand 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.620
 how did this piece come out of his 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.770
 housing so was torn off what are 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.070
 the parties that are broken and how 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.930
 you said it all happened 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.609
 in the middle of the train passage since we 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.300
 sees that it's between the third and the 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:30.420
 fourth vehicle that the event is 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.610
 no doubt happened thanks to you for 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.020
 probably the origin of the derailment 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.300
 of this paris limoges 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.980
 we will try to find out more with 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.870
 Michel Bridge he will tell us 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.450
 what are these people for and how 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.670
 operates a referral you know that 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.649
 the rails are per serving the old ones 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.690
 rails per serving per piece of 18 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.059
 meters and every 18 meters it takes 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.949
 put the rails end to end and for no 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.360
 that they are no longer closed 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.120
 accesses must be held 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.489
 mechanically so there are two plates 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.800
 metal that we do not pay for 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.049
 else and jaka bolts that hold them 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.670
 and we serve it and the rails are good 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.560
 lined up and occasionally there is a small 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.420
 space and that's where the redheads did 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.850
 toc toc knock toc can not now 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.740
 use big rail welded in the tgv or 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.659
 no longer hear toc toc but the principle 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.920
 always remains valid no what 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.930
 calls his rooms splicing these pieces 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.880
 there this piece of life is the 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.619
 bolts 90 the church is this piece 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.960
 metallic do not know who joins the 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.360
 metal just may make the 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.950
 junction between the two rails the wheel does not 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.829
 do not roll on the church it's just 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.900
 on the side of the rail there are holes 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.549
 drilled and we put the balls on we got 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.909
 held by bolts that one serves 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.659
 mechanically and there is a washer this 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.960
 they know it's a puck 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.960
 belleville that avoids cereals so 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.000
 a normal inspection of the railway 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.770
 done by the people dhafra did that 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.540
 usually we look if he's not 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.720
 stopped vibrations the passages of the 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.369
 trains 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.810
 if it does not loosen the last 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.649
 inspection it was the 4th of July it's at 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.310
 say less than ten days ago 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:02.440
 it is normal unfortunately the clis in question 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:06.130
 it's a church that would have loosened 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.680
 but detached and who went to stay 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.119
 in what is called the tip of the heart 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.490
 referral or the tip of the heart 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.680
 this is where the rails intersect and 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.050
 so she lodged her and the wheel is 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.460
 so mounted on it and there is more 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.560
 guiding and that was the beginning of 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.020
 derailment and this derailment is 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.460
 intervened only on the third car 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.840
 that is to say that the hall is that which 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.280
 is troubling his locomotive has passed 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.120
 the promels the first car the 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.010
 second car did not have any 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.540
 problem in Lille we try the fourth 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.720
 who slept and after the others well 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.300
 sure it followed that you see we have 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.920
 the explanation says here it's from the 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.330
 clis who came to stay in the 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.010
 heart tip and that makes that wheel 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.020
 is mounted on it and more guided 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.360
 so now why did she get them 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.050
 crs and an investigation why is she 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.480
 come to stay in the tip of the heart 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.490
 this is the csle the subject of an investigation 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.250
 have you ever seen problems 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.910
 like never have no I saw them 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.770
 cyclists hold see poorly maintained 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.360
 loosen telly we see when we wear 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.220
 see you have watched you fans have 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.410
 guys the train goes boycott 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.330
 obodji post where the cajas made toc toc 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.500
 move when you're driving at 20 mph 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.880
 where 10 per hour it has no 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.310
 therefore not part at high speed 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.890
 but I have never seen clis party 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.020
 loosen or so that was at the end 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.630
 background of siberia means it whatever 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.640
 it can be an act of malice 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.590
 I say it's a hypothesis that does not 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.380
 must be discarded now because 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.780
 for q why remove removed the 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.550
 four bolts that binds to a week 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.590
 the inspection is passed on this 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.690
 turnouts and said he is compliant 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.989
 there was no intervention therefore in 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.870
 a week that all four bolts 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:46.239
 that the room by tso housed at 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.769
 a few meters near just in the 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.300
 frog tip i.e. when 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.769
 the wheel is mounted in the throat the 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.850
 tip of the heart she found a 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.640
 obstacle 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:57.580
 larouche was raised it was more 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.810
 guided and so here it is you see if 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.190
 I understand you well it is not 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.220
 impossible that someone was going 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.490
 to loosen is not impossible 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.050
 can not tell you the spirit of 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.380
 reserve and then a judicial inquiry 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:12.540
 of course I say I imagine that 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.730
 both services of course considering 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.010
 this hypothesis we have a train that 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.720
 was going well despite Arabic the 29 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:22.320
 minutes before 2020 here no problem 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.330
 So here in half an hour it is necessary that 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.010
 the four bolts go away because 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.870
 otherwise mechanic feel walhalla 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.420
 I have a problem it is the signal of 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.410
 times there are laillÃ© attentions through 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.110
 what is called dancer cross 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.240
 it was a father robert lavoie needs 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.060
 to put off balgal segal reports 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.370
 also by radio but there the tibet passed 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.020
 he did not take off half an hour after 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.300
 clis is gone is housed in the tip 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.830
 of heart since last night and especially 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.510
 since this morning we talk a lot about the 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.570
 dilapidated of this network we heard 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:53.430
 a lot of testimonies including 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.720
 I'm going to ask you a question 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.950
 which is very silly but there is always a 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.040
 before and after when there is some 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:00.480
 thing that breaks is it can not 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:04.530
 to be simply bull a job 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:08.700
 that were worn 1.4 four bolts and 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.990
 there are washers you brake that you 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.240
 seems unimaginable 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.850
 it seems to me that I presented 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.690
 that no it seems unthinkable 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.580
 and then I go even further 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:20.729
 why on the first two oars 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:23.900
 rolls it's the first cars are 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:25.560
 passed these emissaries then the lot 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.440
 suppose a malice 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:31.680
 let's call it like that the guy is not going 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.570
 to go the m here is see so there is still 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.979
 an entire low shaded area and 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.300
 it really is the subject of queries 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:38.790
 so the quotation marks stone because he says 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.890
 be very careful dhr for the holidays 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:43.050
 and that's very important see let's say 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:46.130
 not even 24 hours later we say here 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.130
 that's what happened
