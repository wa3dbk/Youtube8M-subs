00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.690

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.700
 just snow snow gray is updated 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.940
 gray that what snow breathe is name 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:23.490
 is a tool that allows it 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:25.050
 create a god 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.530
 that is to say the last god that is the 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.960
 currently that would be 6.1 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.840
 what is the name of that name and 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.300
 we could do the ios is already coming 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.200
 installed cydia the hi bred is going to be 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.210
 you 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.670
 and also about all the things that do not 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.160
 we need the cards without 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.730
 so that to activate the phone is 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.899
 say we avoid the emergency call 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.329
 this does not mean that it will be 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.579
 released for any company what 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.589
 well also what does this program do 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:00.219
 retains the base van especially 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:02.260
 those iphone 4 the 3gs that they want 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:05.080
 keep the base go or if in the case 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.210
 iphone 3gs will have the basis of 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.030
 ipad and still have not degraded it 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:13.620
 They oscillate in degree need bound 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.150
 create a cost mer y os 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.490
 how we do it once we had it 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.650
 downloaded this program that I discard it 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.310
 in the description of the video we are going to 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.310
 click right 

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:29.490
 properties that is the last 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.280
 compatibility and especially run with 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.930
 administrator and windows service pack 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.850
 number 3 so that to avoid any 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.909
 type of error also necessary that 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.350
 have israel number 5 number 6 or the 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.200
 last one that is currently 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.770
 we execute double click we execute as 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.770
 administrator 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:57.700
 very well here we are seeing that if 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.890
 supports 6.1 y before we're not going well 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.130
 with them here he will ask if 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.930
 we have messes or if we lower it in my 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.910
 case as I have worked in the 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:11.930
 iTunes software folder 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.930
 I'm going to look for it 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.190
 oh what 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.190
 this 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.570
 I have a suit and ends at 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:47.030
 ask me if it's the new boot or the 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.030
 old in my case is the old 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:55.180
 here are three ways simple mode or mode 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:57.330
 Expert we will put it in expert mode 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.060
 for in general 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:03.270
 next if you do not have the 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.490
 sim card so you do not have to stay 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:08.280
 what's left for you to avoid the call 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:12.330
 emergency we put it there 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.550
 this also doing it in this way is 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.670
 keep the good base here ask me 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.900
 I think that I have the old bulge 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.269
 you are not going to ask this 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.090
 and then the ties or sources that already 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:29.040
 they are going to default to cydia 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.040
 when it is installed we put it next 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.860
 well to see this 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.299
 well now we create what we put here ips w 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.300
 we have next 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:48.280
 and automatically will begin making 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:52.000
 United 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:55.330
 next I am going to show you 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.610
 as we have to run with and network and 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:00.220
 as we have to install it with itunes 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:03.940
 but the video that you are going to see 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.530
 below is an old video but the 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.690
 procedure is the same as the very important 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.700
 was this then I leave the 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.620
 video but keep in mind that it is a 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.040
 old video but the procedure is 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:17.019
 the same is the most important part 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.900
 Any doubt or any problem that 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:21.519

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.660
 where you want to save it when you create 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:39.360
 the children 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.360
