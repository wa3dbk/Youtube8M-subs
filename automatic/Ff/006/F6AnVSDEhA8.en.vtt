00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
drive over there would be closed so I

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.060

bones in when they were eating and I
thought<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.700> was<00:01:26.820> really<00:01:27.150> really

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
thought that was really really

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.109 
thought that was really really
interesting<00:01:28.080> obviously<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:29.310> am<00:01:29.520> NOT<00:01:29.850> going<00:01:30.090> to

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119

use<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.600> put<00:01:30.750> fish<00:01:30.960> bones<00:01:31.200> in<00:01:31.409> but<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:31.710> think

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
use it to put fish bones in but I think

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.319 
use it to put fish bones in but I think
I<00:01:32.100> will<00:01:32.250> use<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.520> just<00:01:32.640> for<00:01:32.729> rings<00:01:33.090> or

the colors and I don't know how much
this<00:01:59.130> was<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.490> think<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.329> was<00:02:00.360> like<00:02:00.750> three<00:02:01.469> or

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
this was I think it was like three or

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.260 
this was I think it was like three or
four<00:02:01.649> dollars<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.430> prices<00:02:02.790> they<00:02:02.909> were<00:02:02.969> really

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
four dollars the prices they were really

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.679 
four dollars the prices they were really
good

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
good

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.510 
good
so<00:02:03.869> it's<00:02:04.140> about<00:02:04.290> like<00:02:04.590> goodwill<00:02:04.890> Value

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
so it's about like goodwill Value

three things from there the first piece
that<00:03:46.810> I<00:03:47.049> got<00:03:47.079> I<00:03:47.560> think<00:03:47.799> probably<00:03:48.280> some<00:03:48.519> people

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
that I got I think probably some people

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:50.640 
that I got I think probably some people
like<00:03:48.970> it<00:03:49.090> and<00:03:49.209> some<00:03:49.269> people<00:03:49.389> hate<00:03:49.870> it<00:03:49.930> it<00:03:50.290> is

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
like it and some people hate it it is

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.349 
like it and some people hate it it is
this<00:03:50.799> turtleneck<00:03:51.160> sweater<00:03:51.699> and<00:03:52.030> it<00:03:52.239> is

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
this turtleneck sweater and it is

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:55.589 
this turtleneck sweater and it is
striped<00:03:52.810> so<00:03:53.169> it<00:03:53.290> goes<00:03:53.440> red<00:03:53.799> to<00:03:54.519> green<00:03:54.819> I<00:03:55.150> guess

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:55.599 
striped so it goes red to green I guess

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:58.140 
striped so it goes red to green I guess
blue<00:03:55.870> to<00:03:56.019> red<00:03:56.169> to<00:03:56.319> green<00:03:56.530> and<00:03:56.859> I<00:03:57.609> really<00:03:57.940> liked

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
blue to red to green and I really liked

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.789 
blue to red to green and I really liked
this<00:03:58.299> because<00:03:58.480> it<00:03:58.780> personally<00:03:59.230> reminded<00:03:59.680> me

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
this because it personally reminded me

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.129 
this because it personally reminded me
of<00:03:59.829> the<00:04:00.160> universe<00:04:01.030> wetter<00:04:01.269> and<00:04:01.720> I've<00:04:01.930> been

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:02.139 
of the universe wetter and I've been

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:03.479 
of the universe wetter and I've been
really<00:04:02.349> wanting<00:04:02.650> that<00:04:02.949> but<00:04:03.129> I<00:04:03.160> think<00:04:03.250> it's

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
really wanting that but I think it's

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.879 
really wanting that but I think it's
like<00:04:03.549> $90<00:04:04.239> or<00:04:04.449> $100<00:04:05.079> and<00:04:05.319> it's<00:04:05.440> just<00:04:05.650> so

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:05.889 
like $90 or $100 and it's just so

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:07.680 
like $90 or $100 and it's just so
expensive<00:04:06.160> to<00:04:06.639> me<00:04:06.760> I<00:04:06.790> can't<00:04:07.180> justify<00:04:07.540> spending

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
expensive to me I can't justify spending

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.509 
expensive to me I can't justify spending
that<00:04:08.139> money<00:04:08.290> on<00:04:08.440> a<00:04:08.470> sweater<00:04:08.769> especially<00:04:09.400> one

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
that money on a sweater especially one

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:10.530 
that money on a sweater especially one
that<00:04:09.549> looks<00:04:09.790> like<00:04:09.849> that<00:04:09.940> because<00:04:10.389> I<00:04:10.480> know

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
that looks like that because I know

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.180 
that looks like that because I know
after<00:04:10.810> a<00:04:10.989> while<00:04:11.019> I'll<00:04:11.230> get<00:04:11.349> tired<00:04:11.590> of<00:04:11.739> it<00:04:11.889> so

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
after a while I'll get tired of it so

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.650 
after a while I'll get tired of it so
this<00:04:12.280> is<00:04:12.459> basically<00:04:12.730> like<00:04:12.940> my<00:04:12.970> thrift<00:04:13.389> store

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
this is basically like my thrift store

tip<00:04:45.460> right<00:04:45.490> here<00:04:45.730> Allie<00:04:46.360> said<00:04:46.630> I<00:04:46.660> could<00:04:46.900> use<00:04:46.930> it

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
tip right here Allie said I could use it

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:48.630 
tip right here Allie said I could use it
to<00:04:47.320> hold<00:04:47.410> incense<00:04:47.950> which<00:04:48.220> i<00:04:48.310> think<00:04:48.370> would<00:04:48.580> be

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:48.640 
to hold incense which i think would be

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.820 
to hold incense which i think would be
pretty<00:04:48.820> cool<00:04:49.120> I<00:04:49.450> really<00:04:49.930> don't<00:04:50.320> know<00:04:50.440> what<00:04:50.710> it

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
pretty cool I really don't know what it

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.740 
pretty cool I really don't know what it
is<00:04:50.980> I<00:04:51.250> think<00:04:51.430> it's<00:04:51.730> maybe<00:04:51.940> a<00:04:52.060> bottle<00:04:52.270> of<00:04:52.510> some

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
is I think it's maybe a bottle of some

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.960 
is I think it's maybe a bottle of some
sort<00:04:53.260> because<00:04:53.470> it<00:04:54.130> does<00:04:54.310> have<00:04:54.490> a<00:04:54.550> little<00:04:54.760> screw

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
sort because it does have a little screw

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.790 
sort because it does have a little screw
on<00:04:55.000> top<00:04:55.360> but<00:04:55.990> I<00:04:56.020> thought<00:04:56.290> this<00:04:56.410> was<00:04:56.560> really

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
on top but I thought this was really

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.380 
on top but I thought this was really
cool<00:04:56.980> just<00:04:57.250> to<00:04:57.340> put<00:04:57.520> in<00:04:57.580> my<00:04:57.670> room<00:04:57.730> and<00:04:58.210> it<00:04:58.300> was

cool just to put in my room and it was

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.390 
cool just to put in my room and it was
only<00:04:58.510> a<00:04:58.600> dollar<00:04:58.900> and<00:04:59.590> it<00:04:59.890> adds<00:05:00.100> a<00:05:00.250> lot<00:05:00.340> of

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
only a dollar and it adds a lot of

only a dollar and it adds a lot of
character<00:05:00.640> I<00:05:00.910> think<00:05:01.210> yeah<00:05:01.930> that's<00:05:02.260> pretty

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
turtleneck I just showed you so that was

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:43.860 
turtleneck I just showed you so that was
pretty<00:05:42.730> cool<00:05:42.850> it's<00:05:43.360> kind<00:05:43.450> of<00:05:43.570> hard<00:05:43.750> to<00:05:43.810> show

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
pretty cool it's kind of hard to show

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.810 
pretty cool it's kind of hard to show
you<00:05:44.050> can<00:05:44.470> see<00:05:44.620> the<00:05:44.770> general<00:05:45.070> print<00:05:45.430> but<00:05:45.610> it'll

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
you can see the general print but it'll

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.280 
you can see the general print but it'll
be<00:05:45.910> a<00:05:45.940> lot<00:05:46.000> better<00:05:46.240> if<00:05:46.390> I<00:05:46.510> try<00:05:46.720> it<00:05:46.780> on<00:05:46.900> for<00:05:47.140> you

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:47.290 
be a lot better if I try it on for you

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:48.930 
be a lot better if I try it on for you
but<00:05:47.530> it<00:05:47.680> is<00:05:47.770> a<00:05:47.800> little<00:05:48.010> bit<00:05:48.190> kind<00:05:48.430> of<00:05:48.550> cropped

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
but it is a little bit kind of cropped

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.270 
but it is a little bit kind of cropped
and<00:05:49.240> really<00:05:49.510> big<00:05:49.840> and<00:05:50.230> boxy<00:05:50.410> and<00:05:50.830> oversized

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
and really big and boxy and oversized

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.000 
and really big and boxy and oversized
and<00:05:51.790> I<00:05:52.390> just<00:05:52.570> think<00:05:52.720> it's<00:05:52.840> so<00:05:53.140> cool<00:05:53.440> I<00:05:53.680> wish<00:05:53.920> I

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010 
and I just think it's so cool I wish I

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.230 
and I just think it's so cool I wish I
had<00:05:54.100> found<00:05:54.280> this<00:05:54.430> obviously<00:05:55.030> a<00:05:55.060> little<00:05:55.120> bit

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
had found this obviously a little bit

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.850 
had found this obviously a little bit
earlier<00:05:55.630> in<00:05:55.720> the<00:05:55.990> winter<00:05:56.290> because<00:05:56.620> it<00:05:56.740> is

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
earlier in the winter because it is

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.620 
earlier in the winter because it is
almost<00:05:57.100> spring<00:05:57.460> here<00:05:57.670> in<00:05:57.700> Georgia<00:05:58.060> but

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630 
almost spring here in Georgia but

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.060 
almost spring here in Georgia but
hopefully<00:05:58.960> I<00:05:59.020> can<00:05:59.200> still<00:05:59.380> get<00:05:59.470> a<00:05:59.530> used<00:05:59.770> or<00:05:59.920> two

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.070 
hopefully I can still get a used or two

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.040 
hopefully I can still get a used or two
out<00:06:00.220> of<00:06:00.340> it<00:06:00.430> before<00:06:00.520> it<00:06:00.790> gets<00:06:00.850> warm<00:06:01.270> and<00:06:01.660> this

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050 
out of it before it gets warm and this

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.290 
out of it before it gets warm and this
is<00:06:02.170> a<00:06:02.290> print<00:06:02.560> on<00:06:02.680> the<00:06:02.800> inside<00:06:02.830> I<00:06:03.640> seriously
