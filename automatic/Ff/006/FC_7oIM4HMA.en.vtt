other<00:00:31.019> games<00:00:31.349> in<00:00:31.560> this<00:00:31.710> series<00:00:31.769> so<00:00:32.219> far<00:00:32.250> have

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
other games in this series so far have

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.580 
other games in this series so far have
been<00:00:32.969> really<00:00:33.480> really<00:00:33.840> strong<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.350> really

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
been really really strong and really

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.530 
been really really strong and really
interesting<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.280> really<00:00:35.370> great<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.059> far<00:00:36.090> so

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
interesting and really great so far so

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.170 
interesting and really great so far so
hopefully<00:00:37.320> this<00:00:37.530> game<00:00:37.890> holds<00:00:38.610> up<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.090> and

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
hopefully this game holds up to it and

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.270 
hopefully this game holds up to it and
interestingly<00:00:39.750> enough<00:00:40.320> we<00:00:40.530> don't<00:00:40.860> see<00:00:41.129> any

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
interestingly enough we don't see any

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.639 
interestingly enough we don't see any
drones<00:00:41.670> coming<00:00:42.030> in<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:42.719> this<00:00:43.170> may<00:00:43.410> be<00:00:43.469> yeah

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
drones coming in so this may be yeah

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.770 
drones coming in so this may be yeah
this<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:43.920> an<00:00:44.040> 8<00:00:44.219> pool<00:00:44.520> okay<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.149> nerdy<00:00:45.539> I'll

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
this is an 8 pool okay so nerdy I'll

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.170 
this is an 8 pool okay so nerdy I'll
opening<00:00:46.170> up<00:00:46.289> with<00:00:46.440> an<00:00:46.559> 8<00:00:46.800> pool<00:00:47.160> this<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:47.910> not

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
opening up with an 8 pool this is not

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.850 
opening up with an 8 pool this is not
your<00:00:48.239> standard<00:00:48.660> opening<00:00:48.960> by<00:00:49.320> any<00:00:49.530> stretch<00:00:49.770> of

he's going to be in a little bit of

he's going to be in a little bit of
trouble<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:20.100> can<00:01:20.220> see<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.610> barracks<00:01:20.970> is

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
trouble you can see that the barracks is

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.710 
trouble you can see that the barracks is
near<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.689> about<00:01:22.259> what<00:01:22.500> only<00:01:23.130> 40<00:01:23.610> 45<00:01:24.299> seconds

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
near is about what only 40 45 seconds

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.719 
near is about what only 40 45 seconds
done<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.140> far<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.439> spawning<00:01:25.680> pool<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:26.159> about

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
done so far the spawning pool is about

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.580 
done so far the spawning pool is about
done<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.330> now<00:01:27.810> we<00:01:27.869> are<00:01:28.020> going<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.409> be<00:01:28.500> getting

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
done and now we are going to be getting

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.859 
done and now we are going to be getting
three<00:01:29.009> servings<00:01:29.520> pumped<00:01:30.060> out<00:01:30.150> in<00:01:30.450> just<00:01:30.720> a

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
three servings pumped out in just a

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.390 
three servings pumped out in just a
moment<00:01:31.110> so<00:01:31.200> there<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.530> go<00:01:31.560> servings<00:01:32.250> now

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
moment so there you go servings now

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.569 
moment so there you go servings now
being<00:01:33.390> trained<00:01:33.810> they<00:01:34.020> only<00:01:34.229> take<00:01:34.500> 24<00:01:35.100> seconds

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
being trained they only take 24 seconds

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.149 
being trained they only take 24 seconds
to<00:01:35.610> build<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.210> now<00:01:36.840> those<00:01:37.290> units<00:01:37.560> will<00:01:37.770> be<00:01:37.799> on

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
to build and now those units will be on

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.830 
to build and now those units will be on
the<00:01:38.430> move<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:38.909> this<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.479> going<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.689> be

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
the move and this is going to be

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.350 
the move and this is going to be
absolutely<00:01:40.020> critical<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:41.009> see<00:01:41.340> where<00:01:41.850> exactly

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
absolutely critical to see where exactly

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.819 
absolutely critical to see where exactly
of<00:01:42.840> what<00:01:43.049> exactly<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.439> going<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.619> be<00:01:43.680> happening

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
of what exactly is going to be happening

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.950 
of what exactly is going to be happening
here<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.189> Overlord<00:01:44.759> has<00:01:44.909> spotted<00:01:45.570> out<00:01:45.780> this

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
here the Overlord has spotted out this
