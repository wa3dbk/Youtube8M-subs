light there now we're going to take a

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:28.530 
light there now we're going to take a
look<00:02:26.480> inside<00:02:26.810> the<00:02:27.500> machine<00:02:27.799> which<00:02:28.190> will<00:02:28.459> be

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
look inside the machine which will be

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:48.640 
look inside the machine which will be
interesting

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.760 

right<00:02:50.480> so<00:02:51.480> I<00:02:51.540> open<00:02:51.720> up<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:51.870> machine<00:02:52.200> there<00:02:52.740> is

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
right so I open up the machine there is

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.970 
right so I open up the machine there is
a<00:02:52.920> two<00:02:53.580> full<00:02:53.880> screws<00:02:54.210> on<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.540> back<00:02:54.720> which<00:02:55.680> can

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
a two full screws on the back which can

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.020 
a two full screws on the back which can
be<00:02:56.130> easily<00:02:57.050> spread<00:02:58.050> out<00:02:58.430> and<00:02:59.430> we<00:02:59.700> literally

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
be easily spread out and we literally

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:06.530 
be easily spread out and we literally
just<00:03:00.180> go<00:03:04.400> little<00:03:05.400> leave<00:03:05.580> at<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.880> back<00:03:06.030> pork

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
just go little leave at the back pork

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.690 
just go little leave at the back pork
and<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.710> door<00:03:07.920> will<00:03:08.100> fall<00:03:08.370> off

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:18.890 

we're<00:03:14.120> inside<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.360> machine<00:03:17.330> as<00:03:18.330> you<00:03:18.570> see<00:03:18.840> is

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
we're inside the machine as you see is

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.940 
we're inside the machine as you see is
very<00:03:19.140> very<00:03:19.740> compact<00:03:21.320> so<00:03:23.000> up<00:03:24.000> here<00:03:24.360> is<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:25.200> CPU

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
very very compact so up here is the CPU

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.240 
very very compact so up here is the CPU
phone<00:03:26.390> which<00:03:27.390> can<00:03:27.780> which<00:03:28.380> runs<00:03:28.650> quite<00:03:28.920> slow

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
phone which can which runs quite slow

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.100 
phone which can which runs quite slow
but<00:03:29.840> keeps<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:31.050> CPU<00:03:31.650> cold<00:03:32.570> the<00:03:33.570> grills<00:03:33.840> and

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
but keeps the CPU cold the grills and

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
but keeps the CPU cold the grills and
underneath<00:03:34.620> obviously<00:03:35.190> is<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:37.130> processor

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
underneath obviously is the processor

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:47.680 
underneath obviously is the processor
itself<00:03:38.810> and<00:03:44.120> then<00:03:45.120> here<00:03:45.420> I<00:03:45.720> will<00:03:46.080> show<00:03:46.110> you

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
itself and then here I will show you

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:55.220 
itself and then here I will show you
there<00:03:48.690> is<00:03:48.810> a<00:03:48.840> screw<00:03:51.470> here<00:03:52.470> which<00:03:53.780> if<00:03:54.780> you<00:03:54.900> screw

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
there is a screw here which if you screw

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:01.100 
there is a screw here which if you screw
out

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:07.440 

and<00:04:02.310> pull<00:04:03.310> that<00:04:03.819> off<00:04:04.739> you<00:04:05.739> can<00:04:05.980> then<00:04:06.209> move<00:04:07.209> this

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
and pull that off you can then move this

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:17.430 
and pull that off you can then move this
wire<00:04:07.720> here<00:04:08.610> and<00:04:09.870> then<00:04:13.230> can<00:04:15.989> start<00:04:16.989> this<00:04:17.169> off

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
wire here and then can start this off

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.270 
wire here and then can start this off
and<00:04:17.829> off<00:04:18.780> this<00:04:19.780> gives<00:04:20.109> you<00:04:20.259> access<00:04:20.470> then<00:04:21.039> to

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
and off this gives you access then to

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.969 
and off this gives you access then to
the<00:04:21.579> hard<00:04:21.940> drive<00:04:22.259> power<00:04:23.259> supply<00:04:23.680> and

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 
the hard drive power supply and

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:28.200 
the hard drive power supply and
expansion<00:04:24.820> ports<00:04:26.430> this<00:04:27.430> is<00:04:27.610> important<00:04:28.090> if<00:04:28.150> you

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
machine as it is hard drive is a very

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.420 
machine as it is hard drive is a very
very<00:04:36.160> good<00:04:36.639> way<00:04:37.360> of<00:04:37.389> doing<00:04:37.840> it<00:04:38.220> then<00:04:39.220> they've

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
very good way of doing it then they've

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.580 
very good way of doing it then they've
come<00:04:39.580> up<00:04:39.639> with<00:04:39.699> a<00:04:39.820> brilliant<00:04:40.229> click<00:04:41.229> eight<00:04:41.410> way

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
come up with a brilliant click eight way

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.650 
come up with a brilliant click eight way
to<00:04:41.650> get<00:04:42.010> rid<00:04:42.280> of<00:04:42.430> the<00:04:42.580> odd<00:04:42.729> rub<00:04:42.970> or<00:04:43.150> move<00:04:43.449> it

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
to get rid of the odd rub or move it

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.029 
to get rid of the odd rub or move it
pull<00:04:44.530> this<00:04:44.710> forward<00:04:45.070> and<00:04:46.620> lift<00:04:47.620> the<00:04:47.800> hard

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:48.039 
pull this forward and lift the hard

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:54.300 
pull this forward and lift the hard
drive<00:04:48.310> off<00:04:49.470> and<00:04:50.470> then<00:04:50.710> it<00:04:51.699> can<00:04:53.070> pull<00:04:54.070> it<00:04:54.160> out

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
drive off and then it can pull it out

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.620 
drive off and then it can pull it out
like<00:04:55.060> some<00:04:56.280> room<00:04:57.280> for<00:04:57.430> two<00:04:57.669> you<00:04:58.120> get<00:04:58.240> a<00:04:58.300> spare

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
like some room for two you get a spare

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.730 
like some room for two you get a spare
set<00:04:59.470> up<00:04:59.650> but<00:04:59.979> you<00:05:00.039> need<00:05:00.190> another<00:05:00.460> SATA<00:05:00.880> cable

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
set up but you need another SATA cable

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.820 
set up but you need another SATA cable
connect<00:05:02.740> and<00:05:03.099> oh<00:05:03.760> yeah<00:05:04.090> it's<00:05:04.419> free<00:05:04.810> or<00:05:05.229> as<00:05:05.470> for

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
connect and oh yeah it's free or as for

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:12.180 
connect and oh yeah it's free or as for
expansion<00:05:06.660> see<00:05:07.660> the<00:05:07.930> SATA<00:05:08.849> ports<00:05:09.849> so<00:05:10.780> that<00:05:11.190> we

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
expansion see the SATA ports so that we

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.640 
expansion see the SATA ports so that we
can<00:05:12.370> move<00:05:12.520> it<00:05:12.699> back<00:05:12.849> by<00:05:13.180> Dells<00:05:13.510> clever<00:05:13.840> rail

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
can move it back by Dells clever rail

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:22.610 
can move it back by Dells clever rail
system<00:05:15.360> screws<00:05:16.360> up<00:05:17.349> because<00:05:17.740> the<00:05:18.010> rail

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:30.540 

so

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.110 

and<00:05:31.509> that<00:05:31.750> is<00:05:31.960> a<00:05:31.990> cd-rom<00:05:32.470> drive<00:05:32.919> late<00:05:33.580> about<00:05:33.819> it

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
and that is a cd-rom drive late about it

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.830 
and that is a cd-rom drive late about it
people<00:05:34.569> are<00:05:35.289> watching
