00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.250
 dear friends of shift.tv it is long 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.830
 but we reported it 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.080
 will not be long that the world cup 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.099
 starts in klingenthal and you 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.509
 I'm wondering I'm standing this time 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.190
 not on the hill but I'm standing by 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.109
 probably Germany's most famous 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.510
 Snow pile to see in the background 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.949
 he is on the running track when the 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.900
 combiners in klingenthal are at the start 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.150
 hunting were stashed all over 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.550
 summer about 16,000 cubic meters 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.320
 Artificial snow is here about the summer 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.420
 the big question was how were brought 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.149
 Today it will look like the snow 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.140
 it is only one snow is still there 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:36.030
 sawdust were covered 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.280
 and to the surprise and joy of 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.930
 All the snow has a wonderful 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.030
 consistency is such a kind in 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.680
 so snow is not frozen yet and will 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.410
 So here from the big bakken so with 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.690
 Big device charged on two trucks 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.899
 who will let us in right away 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.520
 ride along and about 600 meters before 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.890
 transported to the arena is there 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.680
 thomas meisinger will be waiting for you 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.840
 his snow groomer and the snow 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.190
 Apply at the front and how far forward 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.730
 we would be the same 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.960
 look at 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.360
 I'm just as promised 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.700
 got into the truck one of two 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.590
 leave with friedrich reinhold friedrich 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.750
 We said that you are already often times 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.080
 but he drove away as snow 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:20.790
 a chance or a chance 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:24.180
 can give less 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:28.020
 we are in eleventh place 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:31.380
 before I die step 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.670
 even pieces so by an age 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.079
 Hare in the shop and the snow would have 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.850
 no better than not find 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.870
 can be too keen to her or 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.790
 the complex 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.410
 I just said 600 meters took me 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.420
 so times asked a ride in about 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.240
 17 km again on your 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.540
 Tachograph looked up or how 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.540
 also fans 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:59.829
 never counted how many times father so 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:01.390
 About 200 times we are not blank 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:03.189
 meanwhile from the back of the 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.500
 run the otherwise just the 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:08.050
 We are still short 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:12.450
 in the meantime on the way before in 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.650
 the arena through the 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.530
 through the back door today there is 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.640
 of course, no security in the snow 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.350
 control in the arena 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.930
 The reader snowdrift is so in the 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.060
 vogtland arena arrived we will be the 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.220
 Ski jumping tv if you are not very close 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.900
 it would be like they are used to 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.400
 are now in the know want here 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.600
 with stepped in and above all so 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.910
 now a pure snow 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.410
 with the plant up if there is one 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.150
 a bit rough board can happen 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.590
 since cain highway here in the spout 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.550
 at least not yet the skispringer 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.180
 then wait a bit something 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.160
 other 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.680
 for that is among other things the no large one 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.720
 responsible like cinema already with 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.030
 twice stood in the middle of forest and 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.780
 have the people for the combiner 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.810
 prefers 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.319
 but so is not experienced or yet 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.319
 at this pace 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.540
 Anyone who has come up with this idea is fine 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.120
 we already have one but what has me 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.220
 said as preparation steam only of it 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.150
 have heard 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.150
 the factory 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.140
 brings 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.099
 guests have to 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.060
 only bought at 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.250
 when the snow is sitting by one arrive 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.769
 From approx. we estimate 200 we drove 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.500
 need to all run out of 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.000
 to occupy the plant 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.190
 Friedrich is loading his yes 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.650
 probably hundreds in advance 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.760
 So there is still enough snow behind us and we 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.290
 Of course, he hopes that with heavy 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.310
 what we already see here b-team 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.840
 by tino krause one of the two yes and 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.299
 In the case of the piste bully driver 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.709
 Also other good toys here 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:05.450
 and is now almost on the investment of 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:06.920
 the second one is applied downwards 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.590
 pistenbully also in action we can 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.599
 maybe just a bit over mb 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.040
 2.2 known in the technical language 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:15.170
 heartfelt thanks for the movie behind it all goes 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.299
 a bit down and some will 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.070
 maybe ask yourself why catch 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.539
 the boys are already on monday 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.520
 it is the world cup is rather the 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:23.840
 next week but if you look 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.210
 it can still be imagined 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.970
 a little Wednesday film please the system 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.810
 is now up to 160 meters 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.520
 still green 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.320
 You can maybe tell if you are 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.560
 a little bit of it on film so there are 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.419
 nets underneath otherwise the snow would 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.639
 slide down nicely here 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:42.800
 So and that just everything has occupied 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:44.330
 be from the bottom up and that 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.340
 Of course it takes a while so we 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.770
 appreciate that you decide tonight 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.990
 until the 3 the entire snow from behind 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.780
 to the front this runs a distance 600 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.970
 meter but also positive customer from 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.919
 weather report it may well be that 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.360
 you can shoot artificial snow fast 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:02.210
 you can shoot over here we see 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:05.300
 sometimes a snow cannon so kind 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:08.880
 You can lance from about minus four 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.950
 produce artificial snow 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.050
 to look at a piece that is too 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.150
 a snow cannon so we still have it 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.910
 once upgraded to here in 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.490
 shortest time really snow 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:22.560
 to produce the world cup next 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:27.450
 week on friday starts on all occasions 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:28.560
 and then be able to perform 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.300
 we also had it again 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.730
 of course watching or watching yourself 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.430
 purely on facebook or www weltcup - 

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:37.110
 klingenthal point eu or punkt.de there 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.630
 is also a webcam attached you can 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:42.000
 So follow it nicely like here 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:44.490
 go ahead and the boys 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.720
 we will work tirelessly right away 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.260
 have a little time here to film 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:51.750
 So that's not unique 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.970
 seen at the jump is so counts 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:57.030
 what can you say so are 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.700
 double storey facility over there 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.170
 springer location have the springer already 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.000
 to experience the summer grand prix zum 

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.440
 final of the summer grand prix wise came 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.790
 Everywhere good and if one now 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.120
 bit down film on the other 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.490
 page 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.280
 then we see here is still grass 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:13.500
 we are standing right in the spout of the 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:17.670
 plant so there is still grass and on the 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:20.640
 On the other side, the snow begins on the 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:24.080
 plant so thank you and nice 

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.080
