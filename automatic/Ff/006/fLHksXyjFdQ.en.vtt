00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
time you can see how short that I was

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:15.050 
time you can see how short that I was
compared<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.000> normal<00:02:13.430> and<00:02:14.430> there's<00:02:14.670> some<00:02:14.940> that

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
compared to normal and there's some that

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.360 
compared to normal and there's some that
are<00:02:15.120> kind<00:02:15.420> of<00:02:15.480> soft<00:02:15.750> like<00:02:16.170> this<00:02:16.410> one<00:02:16.650> that<00:02:17.220> was

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
are kind of soft like this one that was

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.759 
are kind of soft like this one that was
in<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:17.519> back<00:02:17.730> because<00:02:18.060> I<00:02:18.630> started<00:02:19.410> separating

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
in the back because I started separating

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:26.750 
in the back because I started separating
some<00:02:23.510> because<00:02:24.510> they<00:02:25.200> were<00:02:25.260> just<00:02:25.560> I<00:02:25.890> feel<00:02:26.700> like

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
some because they were just I feel like

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.400

some<00:02:27.000> of<00:02:27.030> them<00:02:27.180> were<00:02:27.330> didn't<00:02:28.110> want<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.319> be

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
some of them were didn't want to be

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
some of them were didn't want to be
together<00:02:28.530> so<00:02:29.600> separate<00:02:30.600> them
