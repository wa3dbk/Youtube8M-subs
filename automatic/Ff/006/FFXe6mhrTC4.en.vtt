00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
and then go to it and make about three

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.150 
and then go to it and make about three
furnaces<00:00:48.990> three<00:00:49.440> because<00:00:49.740> you're<00:00:49.890> not<00:00:49.980> going

experienced<00:00:52.050> enough<00:00:52.290> then<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.310> could<00:00:53.520> um<00:00:53.700> you

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:54.240 
experienced enough then you could um you

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.479 
experienced enough then you could um you
could<00:00:54.360> only<00:00:54.570> use<00:00:54.900> one<00:00:55.320> but<00:00:55.590> even<00:00:56.250> if<00:00:56.340> you're

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
trying to duplicate and bam there's a 64

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.670 
trying to duplicate and bam there's a 64
stack<00:02:32.040> right<00:02:32.219> there<00:02:32.459> that's<00:02:33.209> not<00:02:33.480> all<00:02:33.629> pick<00:02:34.529> up

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680

the 64 stack and then hold X all the way
until<00:02:38.939> it's<00:02:39.480> completely<00:02:40.049> deployed<00:02:40.559> and<00:02:41.279> then

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
until it's completely deployed and then

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.140

once it's all gone there's another 64

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.659 
once it's all gone there's another 64
stack<00:02:45.450> so<00:02:46.349> then<00:02:46.559> you<00:02:46.859> could<00:02:47.010> pretty<00:02:47.159> much<00:02:47.249> fill

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:47.669 
stack so then you could pretty much fill

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:49.909 
stack so then you could pretty much fill
up<00:02:47.849> your<00:02:47.879> whole<00:02:48.299> entire<00:02:48.419> inventory<00:02:48.959> or
