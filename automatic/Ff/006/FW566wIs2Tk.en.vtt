 a new distiller is not what he calls 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:22.470

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.260
 the industry 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.239
 the pleasure of making whiskey is not almost a 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.970
 work for many people is a job 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.530
 but inside the great physicist you know 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.349
 the fellow children who work in the 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.980
 outside and you really realize the 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:41.989
 pleasure that is that they have when doing 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:45.530
 produce when maturing 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:48.439
 being involved with what is 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.609
 create cable car and now we have me 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:51.680
 I love, I've been needing 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:53.209
 many times and every time you go there 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.909
 then talk to one of the classmates 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:58.879

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:04.609
 a book full of experiences and 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.250
 share with them I 'm lucky 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:08.989
 from now study in June to share 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.510
 with him and the max payne that is a 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:14.480
 Old Tyumen decision that more than 35 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.739
 years in the company 42 easy tactical but 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.949
 after sharing with people who have 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:23.060
 A lot of history is bought 15 on the board 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:25.880
 star and it's going to be a mixer plus the 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.280
 lens mixer novels not because it's coming 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.820
 of one hundred of the plans whiskeys the smog 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:34.240
 master is the teacher 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:38.170
 although then I made a clarification to 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.820
 have many of the companies that have 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.370
 within its portfolio william grant 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:47.620
 sons have some products behind 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:50.590
 polo player and we have big crowns 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.750
 island is here in colombia 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.180
 I was here we have 5 ways and we have 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.940
 whiskeys that means what the 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:01.500
 same person exercises two times the 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.500
 position of the master of the brand 

00:05:04.019 --> 00:05:08.930
 has two title doctors within the 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:11.220
 lifetime 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.350
 and also, well, I think that 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.810
 work is pretty interesting or not me 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:18.840
 I'm also an artist and I compare it as 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:21.000
 a painter or being everything is a painter 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:24.060
 he has to select the colors 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:27.030
 first you have to select fear 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:31.920
 go as playing with him creating and I think 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:33.510
 that the relationship that a society is a 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.100
 example slogan we do to 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:37.170
 times to explain how to make a 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.540
 whiskey and then I am myself many times 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:41.460
 he noted that a lot of people a lot of interest 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:44.100
 this kind of examples but I'm 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.140
 within them we are in him as 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.060
 It is a picture as you created a painting 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.420
 study you choose an intense one and it makes you 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.420
 cap 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.950
 for that matter the blend in whiskey is removed 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.810
 for that base that base of the canvas because 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:00.510
 you paint the canvas would be 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:03.710
 uncomfortable the forgiveness is inconcrete if not 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.710
 they believe that is the basis of everything 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.610
 in the case of the five modes that basis 

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:11.420
 this malt main whiskey which 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:14.660
 going to give is a way 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:17.630
 an initial character and character where more 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:19.250
 times what gives it its characteristic 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.870
 principal 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:23.570
 and then you start painting the canvas 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:26.630
 of the painting with brushstrokes that brushstrokes 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:30.680
 they are the ones that give character the softness 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:32.210
 antonio the texture they give harmony they give 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.190
 certain aspects that are what 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.760
 characterize individually each 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.760
 humorless 

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:44.660
 we had our base, which is a 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:46.310
 whiskey or insane sweet fruity 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:49.580
 English the substitute but sometimes 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:52.520
 we use gene casks to English 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.110
 more rich port of another type that we 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.910
 they are going to help give us more character 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.510
 louis here we have three examples 

00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:01.520
 true and the three of them have a mixture 

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:04.520
 in different proportions each of 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.980
 use barrels explore see what we 

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:10.630
 it will make it taste sweeter 

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:13.160
 more creamy to vanilla dust of and 

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:16.770
 much calmer sensations but to 

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:19.669
 the time very harmonic for danny still llosa 

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:23.190
 in the other part of what makes up a 

00:07:19.669 --> 00:07:27.090
 subject are the whiskeys matured in 

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:29.610
 Ex-chef barrels excess parrots and that 

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:31.590
 they give us what I told you 

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:33.090
 with pints the picture is giving you like 

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:36.000
 character will give you feelings and 

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:38.009
 we decided to explosives to nuts 

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.680
 candied fruits will give you your 

00:07:38.009 --> 00:07:42.810
 intention is a little intense short 

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:44.340
 duration to the palate that combined with the 

00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:47.069
 problem that always has a little more 

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:49.050
 of length to the creams body in mouth 

00:07:47.069 --> 00:07:51.740
 Well, you create a pretty balance 

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:51.740
 interesting
