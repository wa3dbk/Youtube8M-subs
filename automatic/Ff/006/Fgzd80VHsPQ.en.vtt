00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
but I think it's pretty clear and clear

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.939 
but I think it's pretty clear and clear
to<00:04:08.699> me<00:04:08.819> I<00:04:08.849> don't<00:04:09.180> think<00:04:09.359> when<00:04:10.349> you<00:04:10.440> see<00:04:10.650> it<00:04:10.739> is

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:10.949 
to me I don't think when you see it is

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:12.979 
to me I don't think when you see it is
triple<00:04:11.400> H<00:04:11.519> and<00:04:11.970> Shawn<00:04:12.359> Michaels<00:04:12.419> have<00:04:12.840> had

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
triple H and Shawn Michaels have had

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:14.809 
triple H and Shawn Michaels have had
thousands<00:04:13.650> of<00:04:13.799> good<00:04:13.949> matches<00:04:14.430> their<00:04:14.579> last

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
thousands of good matches their last

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:16.189 
thousands of good matches their last
match<00:04:15.000> was<00:04:15.060> on<00:04:15.329> a<00:04:15.359> tribute<00:04:15.720> for<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:15.930> troops

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:18.259 
match was on a tribute for the troops
they<00:04:17.160> probably<00:04:17.340> deserve<00:04:17.729> to<00:04:17.880> have<00:04:18.030> a<00:04:18.090> little

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
they probably deserve to have a little

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:19.640 
they probably deserve to have a little
bit<00:04:18.449> better<00:04:18.570> of<00:04:18.720> a<00:04:18.840> match<00:04:18.989> there<00:04:19.260> but<00:04:19.470> they

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
bit better of a match there but they

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.319
