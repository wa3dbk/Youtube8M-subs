 we had a program coordinated with the organization of this trip and that 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.630
 I knew that there was a press conference and that the media was an hour before 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.010
 a few players only 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.220

 normal population that says very big boys learn yes 

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:47.369
 and after for the current players 

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:51.119

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:54.349

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:58.409

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:13.949
 He follows this country very much the premier league that the guys who land there immediately 

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:17.419

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:21.099

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.689
