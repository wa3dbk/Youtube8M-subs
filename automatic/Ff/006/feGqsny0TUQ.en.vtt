the<00:03:46.250> side<00:03:46.489> of<00:03:46.640> the<00:03:46.730> lip<00:03:46.939> and<00:03:47.900> you<00:03:48.260> can<00:03:48.409> do<00:03:48.560> that

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
the side of the lip and you can do that

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.750 
the side of the lip and you can do that
up<00:03:48.829> here<00:03:48.860> on<00:03:49.280> top<00:03:49.610> as<00:03:49.939> well<00:03:51.400> you<00:03:52.400> can<00:03:52.579> really

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
up here on top as well you can really

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.660 
up here on top as well you can really
you<00:03:52.970> can<00:03:53.030> work<00:03:53.329> in<00:03:53.480> circles<00:03:54.049> and<00:03:54.620> then<00:03:55.340> drain

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
you can work in circles and then drain

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.039 
you can work in circles and then drain
down<00:03:56.000> the<00:03:56.239> lip<00:03:56.890> now<00:03:57.890> like<00:03:58.640> with<00:03:58.849> anything<00:03:59.239> you

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
down the lip now like with anything you

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.740 
down the lip now like with anything you
this<00:04:00.439> is<00:04:00.620> not<00:04:00.829> an<00:04:01.099> overnight<00:04:01.400> fix<00:04:01.879> but<00:04:02.269> if<00:04:02.510> you

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
this is not an overnight fix but if you

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.160 
this is not an overnight fix but if you
stick<00:04:03.140> to<00:04:03.170> it<00:04:03.560> in<00:04:04.090> about<00:04:05.090> six<00:04:05.450> weeks<00:04:05.569> to<00:04:05.840> three

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
stick to it in about six weeks to three

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.050 
stick to it in about six weeks to three
months<00:04:06.470> you're<00:04:06.650> really<00:04:07.069> going<00:04:07.250> to<00:04:07.340> see<00:04:07.579> a<00:04:07.609> huge

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
months you're really going to see a huge

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.089 
months you're really going to see a huge
result<00:04:08.450> some<00:04:08.659> people<00:04:08.930> see<00:04:09.170> a<00:04:09.439> big<00:04:09.769> result

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 
result some people see a big result

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.149 
result some people see a big result
after<00:04:10.609> using<00:04:10.819> it<00:04:11.060> for<00:04:11.590> two<00:04:12.590> to<00:04:12.709> three<00:04:12.739> weeks

00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:13.159 
after using it for two to three weeks

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:15.789 
after using it for two to three weeks
but<00:04:13.430> you'll<00:04:14.150> really<00:04:14.450> see<00:04:14.750> a<00:04:14.780> huge<00:04:15.439> result

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
but you'll really see a huge result

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.039 
but you'll really see a huge result
after<00:04:16.280> about<00:04:16.459> three<00:04:16.940> months<00:04:16.970> usually<00:04:17.870> about

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
after about three months usually about

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.990 
after about three months usually about
three<00:04:18.380> cell<00:04:18.650> turnovers<00:04:19.190> is<00:04:19.459> when<00:04:19.609> our<00:04:19.760> cells

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
three cell turnovers is when our cells

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.900 
three cell turnovers is when our cells
really<00:04:20.389> start<00:04:20.690> to<00:04:20.840> change<00:04:21.220> because<00:04:22.220> when<00:04:22.880> our

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
really start to change because when our

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.689 
really start to change because when our
cells<00:04:23.419> are<00:04:23.720> damaged<00:04:24.320> every<00:04:24.949> time<00:04:25.160> the<00:04:25.310> DNA

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:25.699 
cells are damaged every time the DNA

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:27.189 
cells are damaged every time the DNA
goes<00:04:25.910> by<00:04:26.090> and<00:04:26.270> reads<00:04:26.419> them<00:04:26.570> it<00:04:26.720> reads<00:04:26.930> it<00:04:27.080> as<00:04:27.169> a

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199 
goes by and reads them it reads it as a

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:29.650 
goes by and reads them it reads it as a
damaged<00:04:27.710> cell<00:04:27.979> so<00:04:28.520> you<00:04:28.610> really<00:04:29.150> need<00:04:29.330> it<00:04:29.479> takes

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
damaged cell so you really need it takes

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.450 
damaged cell so you really need it takes
about<00:04:29.810> three<00:04:30.289> months<00:04:30.500> to<00:04:30.710> really<00:04:30.919> trick<00:04:31.250> that

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
about three months to really trick that

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.159 
about three months to really trick that
cell<00:04:31.729> into<00:04:32.030> thinking<00:04:32.389> it's<00:04:32.539> a<00:04:32.630> healthy<00:04:32.930> cell

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
cell into thinking it's a healthy cell

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:34.840 
cell into thinking it's a healthy cell
again<00:04:33.440> so<00:04:33.650> always<00:04:34.010> be<00:04:34.160> patient<00:04:34.580> with<00:04:34.699> your

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
again so always be patient with your

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.250 
again so always be patient with your
skin<00:04:35.090> care<00:04:35.270> and<00:04:35.389> any<00:04:35.539> new<00:04:35.720> products<00:04:36.139> you're

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
skin care and any new products you're

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.379 
skin care and any new products you're
using<00:04:36.289> what<00:04:37.130> I<00:04:37.160> also<00:04:37.370> like<00:04:37.669> about<00:04:37.699> this<00:04:38.090> is<00:04:38.270> it

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:38.389 
using what I also like about this is it

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:43.749 
using what I also like about this is it
has<00:04:38.539> other<00:04:40.360> little<00:04:41.620> electrodes<00:04:42.620> in<00:04:42.889> it<00:04:43.039> so<00:04:43.610> if

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:43.759 
has other little electrodes in it so if

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:46.779 
has other little electrodes in it so if
you're<00:04:43.940> having<00:04:44.360> as<00:04:44.570> it<00:04:45.080> you<00:04:45.949> can<00:04:46.130> just<00:04:46.340> pop<00:04:46.550> in

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:46.789 
you're having as it you can just pop in

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:48.610 
you're having as it you can just pop in
it's<00:04:47.120> this<00:04:47.449> one<00:04:47.690> right<00:04:47.840> here<00:04:48.080> now<00:04:48.229> this<00:04:48.380> one's

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
it's this one right here now this one's

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.620 
it's this one right here now this one's
a<00:04:48.740> little<00:04:48.830> bit<00:04:49.130> more<00:04:50.860> zappy<00:04:52.150> you<00:04:53.150> can<00:04:53.360> again

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
a little bit more zappy you can again

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:54.879 
a little bit more zappy you can again
break<00:04:53.960> it<00:04:54.080> with<00:04:54.199> your<00:04:54.320> finger<00:04:54.590> and<00:04:54.650> if<00:04:54.740> you

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
break it with your finger and if you

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.370 
break it with your finger and if you
have<00:04:55.070> is<00:04:55.250> it<00:04:55.490> you<00:04:56.090> can<00:04:56.240> just<00:04:56.419> hold<00:04:56.780> it<00:04:56.990> on<00:04:57.110> is<00:04:57.349> it

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
have is it you can just hold it on is it

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.200 
have is it you can just hold it on is it
or<00:04:57.830> you<00:04:58.070> can<00:04:58.220> what's<00:04:58.430> it<00:04:58.639> called

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
or you can what's it called

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.649 
or you can what's it called
far<00:04:59.479> gasp<00:05:00.050> visit<00:05:00.740> and<00:05:01.280> just<00:05:01.880> go<00:05:02.060> like<00:05:02.090> this<00:05:02.270> to

00:05:02.649 --> 00:05:02.659 
far gasp visit and just go like this to

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:04.629 
far gasp visit and just go like this to
get<00:05:02.750> it<00:05:02.810> to<00:05:02.930> go<00:05:03.169> down<00:05:03.199> really<00:05:03.979> really<00:05:04.370> fast

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 
get it to go down really really fast

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:06.430 
get it to go down really really fast
it's<00:05:04.909> really<00:05:05.030> going<00:05:05.330> to<00:05:05.419> pinpoint<00:05:05.720> and<00:05:06.169> kill

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
it's really going to pinpoint and kill

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.100 
it's really going to pinpoint and kill
that<00:05:06.620> bacteria<00:05:06.830> and<00:05:07.550> then<00:05:08.300> also<00:05:08.570> if<00:05:08.900> you're

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
that bacteria and then also if you're

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.310 
that bacteria and then also if you're
having<00:05:09.139> problems<00:05:09.740> with<00:05:10.280> your<00:05:10.340> scalp<00:05:10.909> it<00:05:11.720> has<00:05:12.289> a

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
having problems with your scalp it has a

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.110 
having problems with your scalp it has a
little<00:05:12.560> comb<00:05:12.919> which<00:05:13.159> is<00:05:13.310> really<00:05:13.639> nice<00:05:13.820> and

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:16.909 
again you can take this comb and you can

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:21.040 
again you can take this comb and you can
put<00:05:17.120> it<00:05:17.210> in<00:05:17.389> and<00:05:17.720> you<00:05:18.289> can<00:05:18.500> work<00:05:18.860> it<00:05:19.099> in<00:05:19.340> to<00:05:20.270> your

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
put it in and you can work it in to your

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.040 
put it in and you can work it in to your
hair<00:05:21.380> and<00:05:21.710> your<00:05:21.889> scalp<00:05:22.159> line<00:05:22.520> at<00:05:23.300> night<00:05:23.659> before

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
hair and your scalp line at night before

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.129 
hair and your scalp line at night before
you<00:05:24.409> go<00:05:24.440> to<00:05:24.650> bed<00:05:25.130> but<00:05:25.909> this<00:05:26.180> is<00:05:26.389> my<00:05:26.630> favorite

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:27.139 
you go to bed but this is my favorite

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:28.810 
you go to bed but this is my favorite
electrode<00:05:27.710> in<00:05:28.039> all<00:05:28.159> of<00:05:28.340> them<00:05:28.460> because<00:05:28.669> it's

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:28.820 
electrode in all of them because it's

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.870 
electrode in all of them because it's
really<00:05:29.120> smooth<00:05:29.539> and<00:05:29.960> you<00:05:30.830> can<00:05:30.860> really<00:05:31.370> work

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
really smooth and you can really work

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.779 
really smooth and you can really work
the<00:05:32.240> eye<00:05:32.270> area<00:05:32.960> and<00:05:33.229> really<00:05:33.500> drain<00:05:33.949> down<00:05:34.190> the

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:34.789 
the eye area and really drain down the

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:37.420 
the eye area and really drain down the
lymph<00:05:35.030> area<00:05:35.510> so<00:05:35.870> I<00:05:36.080> really<00:05:36.770> love<00:05:36.979> this<00:05:37.099> tool

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
lymph area so I really love this tool

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.399 
lymph area so I really love this tool
I'll<00:05:37.729> put<00:05:38.000> the<00:05:38.120> link<00:05:38.360> down<00:05:38.599> below<00:05:38.630> of<00:05:39.199> where

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:39.409
