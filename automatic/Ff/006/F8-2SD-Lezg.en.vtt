the<00:00:35.399> next<00:00:35.700> video<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.180> publishing<00:00:36.989> I'm

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
the next video and publishing I'm

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.240 
the next video and publishing I'm
thinking<00:00:37.680> about<00:00:38.010> maybe<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.149> pacman<00:00:40.140> or<00:00:40.800> a

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
thinking about maybe a pacman or a

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.910 
thinking about maybe a pacman or a
square<00:00:41.820> board<00:00:42.270> or<00:00:43.850> what<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.660> 3d<00:00:46.559> Lego

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
square board or what is it a 3d Lego

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.830 
square board or what is it a 3d Lego
cube<00:00:47.370> which<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.360> was<00:00:48.450> talking<00:00:48.750> about<00:00:49.129> and<00:00:50.840> those

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
cube which I was talking about and those

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.750 
cube which I was talking about and those
are<00:00:51.870> my<00:00:52.110> two<00:00:52.489> possible<00:00:53.489> videos<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.829> i<00:00:55.829> think<00:00:56.520> i

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
are my two possible videos and i think i

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.270 
are my two possible videos and i think i
might<00:00:56.969> be<00:00:57.239> making<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.899> cube<00:00:58.320> first<00:00:58.770> because

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
might be making the cube first because

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.500 
might be making the cube first because
it's<00:00:59.430> like<00:00:59.579> oh<00:01:01.370> my<00:01:02.370> god<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.879> looks<00:01:03.030> like<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.270> job
