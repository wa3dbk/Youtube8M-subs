 the two words that evoke are available since August 26 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:16.650
 so to mark that the order books are passed in relation to the 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.970
 box design 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.220
 ap london - green does not start, that's why screens 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.009
 with the regional police 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.079
 she claims to be the starting point 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:28.560
 because of the end 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.909
 here is the courtyard 

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:33.810

 still spoiled because in the process of degassing big 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.750
 always so strong it's exactly the same as the one found in the 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.390
 single version rarely the black and white scorer 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.700
 and it will be the same 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.220
 to laugh a little bit it's the same as the one with the black and white scorer who 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.220
 would cost 35 35 euros 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.390
 connor india leparmentier 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.770

 the work will start with four more units than the more matches 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.160
 we believe that the team in the val-d'oise 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.180
