racial<00:01:50.929> equality<00:01:51.170> here<00:01:51.619> but<00:01:51.770> there<00:01:51.950> are<00:01:51.979> other

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
types of equality and so we have this

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.560 
types of equality and so we have this
problem<00:01:54.439> in<00:01:54.859> that<00:01:54.950> Atticus<00:01:55.520> he<00:01:56.030> is<00:01:56.179> a<00:01:56.210> center

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
problem in that Atticus he is a center

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.770 
problem in that Atticus he is a center
of<00:01:56.689> equality<00:01:56.990> in<00:01:57.380> Maycomb<00:01:57.799> he<00:01:58.249> is<00:01:58.340> he<00:01:58.490> really

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
of equality in Maycomb he is he really

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.139 
of equality in Maycomb he is he really
showing<00:01:59.780> that<00:01:59.929> everyone<00:02:00.469> is<00:02:00.590> equal

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
showing that everyone is equal

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:03.849 
showing that everyone is equal
we<00:02:02.149> stand<00:02:02.390> on<00:02:02.600> the<00:02:02.659> shoulders<00:02:03.289> of<00:02:03.590> those

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:05.770 
we stand on the shoulders of those
individuals<00:02:04.399> that<00:02:04.429> come<00:02:04.670> before<00:02:04.880> us<00:02:05.210> that's<00:02:05.539> a

individuals that come before us that's a

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.450 
individuals that come before us that's a
gift<00:02:06.020> that<00:02:06.229> I<00:02:06.289> think<00:02:06.590> this<00:02:06.770> year<00:02:06.950> seniors<00:02:07.340> are

gift that I think this year seniors are

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.820 
gift that I think this year seniors are
leaving<00:02:07.759> behind<00:02:07.850> but<00:02:08.569> the<00:02:08.720> expectation<00:02:09.679> is

diversity because it's built into your

there's<00:03:10.890> a<00:03:10.950> part<00:03:11.340> of<00:03:11.460> what<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:11.700> adults<00:03:12.120> have

there's a part of what the adults have
to<00:03:12.300> do<00:03:12.570> I<00:03:12.600> think<00:03:12.840> which<00:03:13.290> is<00:03:13.470> to<00:03:13.560> get<00:03:13.740> out<00:03:13.860> of<00:03:13.890> the

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
to do I think which is to get out of the

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:21.860 
to do I think which is to get out of the
way<00:03:18.560> culture<00:03:19.560> can<00:03:19.950> define<00:03:20.700> what<00:03:21.150> gender<00:03:21.690> is

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
way culture can define what gender is

way culture can define what gender is
for<00:03:22.590> specific<00:03:23.190> people<00:03:23.730> I'm<00:03:24.180> a<00:03:24.240> straight<00:03:24.630> white

male from a pretty well-off family that
might<00:03:28.770> make<00:03:29.070> you<00:03:29.190> think<00:03:29.400> that<00:03:29.460> I<00:03:29.610> wouldn't

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
might make you think that I wouldn't

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.490 
might make you think that I wouldn't
want<00:03:30.090> to<00:03:30.180> get<00:03:30.330> involved<00:03:30.750> and<00:03:30.840> that<00:03:30.990> I<00:03:31.020> wouldn't

apply<00:03:33.120> to<00:03:33.209> me<00:03:33.420> but<00:03:33.660> then<00:03:33.810> I<00:03:34.050> guess<00:03:34.920> a<00:03:35.250> sort<00:03:35.730> of<00:03:35.880> a

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
apply to me but then I guess a sort of a

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.960 
apply to me but then I guess a sort of a
sense<00:03:36.360> of<00:03:36.570> this<00:03:37.290> is<00:03:37.440> bigger<00:03:37.709> than<00:03:38.010> me<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.730> Gay

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
sense of this is bigger than me the Gay

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.520 
sense of this is bigger than me the Gay
Straight<00:03:39.209> Alliance<00:03:39.270> the<00:03:39.900> name<00:03:40.110> itself

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
Straight Alliance the name itself

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.000 
Straight Alliance the name itself
implies<00:03:40.800> that<00:03:41.580> I'm<00:03:42.480> valued<00:03:43.230> there<00:03:43.590> more

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
implies that I'm valued there more

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.979 
implies that I'm valued there more
people<00:03:44.310> getting<00:03:44.489> involved<00:03:45.030> that<00:03:45.360> are<00:03:45.480> like<00:03:45.720> me

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
people getting involved that are like me

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.470 
people getting involved that are like me
it's<00:03:46.709> really<00:03:47.040> important<00:03:47.459> the<00:03:47.700> more<00:03:47.730> that<00:03:48.330> you

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
it's really important the more that you

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.690 
it's really important the more that you
can<00:03:48.720> have<00:03:49.080> diverse<00:03:49.620> perspectives<00:03:50.310> in<00:03:50.520> the

when<00:03:56.220> I<00:03:56.250> think<00:03:56.760> about<00:03:56.850> somebody<00:03:57.480> who<00:03:57.780> might

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
when I think about somebody who might

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.449 
when I think about somebody who might
fit<00:03:58.200> into<00:03:58.350> this<00:03:58.560> category<00:03:58.620> I'm<00:03:59.190> really

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.340 
fit into this category I'm really
thinking<00:03:59.700> about<00:04:00.120> my<00:04:00.330> friend<00:04:00.660> sitting<00:04:00.930> next<00:04:01.050> to

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
thinking about my friend sitting next to

thinking about my friend sitting next to
me<00:04:01.500> and<00:04:01.709> so<00:04:02.520> it<00:04:02.760> changes<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:03.390> way<00:04:03.720> we<00:04:04.140> all<00:04:04.410> can

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
me and so it changes the way we all can

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.220 
me and so it changes the way we all can
be<00:04:05.160> in<00:04:05.190> the<00:04:05.430> world<00:04:05.640> change<00:04:06.450> is<00:04:06.660> something<00:04:06.900> that

be in the world change is something that

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.310

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
takes a tremendous amount of time and a

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.710 
takes a tremendous amount of time and a
tremendous<00:04:11.010> amount<00:04:11.280> of<00:04:11.520> patience<00:04:12.060> it's<00:04:12.540> a

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
tremendous amount of patience it's a

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.350

be okay with is the fact that I'm ever
going<00:04:20.609> to<00:04:20.669> stop<00:04:20.910> trying<00:04:21.359> to<00:04:21.840> learn<00:04:22.470> about<00:04:22.650> the
