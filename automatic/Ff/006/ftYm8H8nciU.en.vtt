00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.590

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.010
 loving dogs we are playful and demand 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.939

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:24.390

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.420
 and we need constant communication we 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.539
 we can live families with children well, even better 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.510
 we live with adults very much 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.280
 little kids don't always take 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.430

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:45.059
 patience and understanding despite being 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.960
 that we love to be the only ones 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:52.350
 pets however we get along well with 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:56.879
 other animals especially if we grow up with 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:01.170
 we have been guarding them together since childhood 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:05.369
 home and always warned the host if 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.570
 someone is standing at the door with ours 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.810
 the owners 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.110
 we easily install very close and 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.140
 tender relationship we are loyal and 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:20.420
 companions loving conduct as much as possible 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:24.420
 more time next to their masters 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:27.299
 our small size is sociable 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.450
 and the minimum physical requirement 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.560
 loads makes us the perfect dog 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:37.680
 for older people and small owners 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.750
 my french bulldogs apartments are the best 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.810
 friends 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:45.810
 Affectionate pets and playful companions 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.119
 we need minimal care 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.770
 wool 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:53.210
 comb on preferably once 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.700
 week to remove less wool 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.409
 we should fall no more than 1 time in 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.780
 month 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:03.630
 too frequent bathing can cause 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.399
 through nervous dryness of the skin and itching and 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.129
 dandruff 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:10.830
 care of your paws includes haircut 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:13.480
 claws and paws checking on 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.840
 The necessity for cracks 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.810
 take care of the crease above our no 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.110
 accumulates moisture and dirt that can 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.989
 cause infection to wipe gently 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.900
 her cotton pad 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:33.400
 ear cleaning is also an important regular 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:37.120
 procedure shift the state of our ears 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.549
 they should always be clean if you 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.250
 noticed a suspicious discharge 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:45.790
 redness swelling game bad 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.879
 smell is best to ask for help 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.670
 to the vet 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:55.000
 rub our eyes regularly and watch 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:59.290
 for their condition we do not require 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:03.959
 long walks need a lot 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:07.239
 the amount of attention we love to eat 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.280
 so you need to keep track of our 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.890
 diets 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:15.190
 due to the features of the structure of the nose and 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:18.489
 skull we may have problems with 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.669
 breathing especially during excessive 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:24.060
 excitement or at high temperature 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:27.160
 the environment 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:30.130
 so try not to walk us in 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:33.519
 very hot weather or cut and 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:36.299
 such walks to a minimum for today
