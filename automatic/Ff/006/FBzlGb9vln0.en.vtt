00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.700
 google to hello very good to all and for 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.820
 I'm here on a survival map 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.910
 that good is not common but it has 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.219
 something typical that good I did it more than 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.529
 nothing to show them what the 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.060
 kind of what it was like mission 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.460
 I'm probably going to see something the guide 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.109
 but it's because I'm rendering 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.050
 another video apart I have the burden of 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.030
 made very, very big indeed 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.920
 I'm going to lower it a little 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.340
 let's go down decime what you allow and I 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.640
 they went down 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:38.230
 a little more and I think this would be fine 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.059
 there are minimal particles and ready there I will 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.610
 to be a little better I think if I see it a 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:45.160
 little better than good you have these 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.650
 missions has 10 missions in total there 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.900
 they have the bonus box that good I ran it 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:53.190
 of the place because it was generated in 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.190
 the spa a point 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.590
 the expansion forgiveness and as always this 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.910
 is active because he preferred to do the 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.860
 commands here all the commands are going to 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.530
 be down here and I 'll show you 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.050
 so I do not get lost in the quartz floor 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.050
 very well I broke of mass and good here they are 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.580
 all things in the end one comes out 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.380
 pyrotechnics that if you want it is activated 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.700
 you just have to break that block 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.560
 pro 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.570
 that signal from rest rings is disabled 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.100
 completely no longer necessary that 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.920
 destroying the circuit that if you want it 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.330
 do is the same goes to your ball after 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.970
 download the map again if you want or 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.740
 no and well have these ten missions that 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.590
 they are simple that says get a 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.840
 apple get an apple capture 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.110
 a golden apple undermine a name 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.820
 diamond create a diamond sword 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.130
 chop an obsidian block 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.289
 a table enchantments kill three 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.770
 villagers because that because I put everything 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:48.090
 crazy kill 10 silver fish get the 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.159
 achievement of killing some but with 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.479
 only kill the weather enough does not 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.340
 missing all the achievements for 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.130
 get the achievement they know what to do 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.350
 the achievement of 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.880
 widder then they have to do all up 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.740
 he starts out the weather and the 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.020
 complete it but with that they kill it is 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.360
 enough the truth that activates the 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.320
 of the widder and then if they do it first and 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.630
 then in the others 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.750
 then you selective but you only have 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.400
 Careful material says rustling a bacon or 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.470
 a lighthouse that are the lighthouses that have the 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.530
 light up everything unless you 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.810
 tapen and good has those 10 kind of 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.510
 emissions or are a little intertwined 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.340
 each one like that of the apple and makes 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.569
 a golden diamond apple and a sword 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.300
 of diamond and things like that 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.190
 Hello 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.630
 aus and diana and the rock treatments 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.390
 to make it a little simpler 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:38.410
 since it's a survival map and for 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.450
 do not play minecraft to the normal then and if 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.730
 they can not play it because they can not 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.170
 has an ugly average computer or gives 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.270
 of the illusion of playing with missions 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.940
 have a goal in addition to the main 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:52.150
 what is it to kill dragon leander? 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.560
 is not the goal that but if well 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.610
 they can do it they have 10 missions 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.660
 they include massages 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.280
 the chest as I told you and well 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.440
 that's all for every mission that 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.120
 complete they will have some prizes that 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.670
 will continue to help you in your adventure 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.050
 and that's it so I hope you 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.440
 have liked what we are going to take away 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.600
 this and I hope you liked it and for 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.550
 on the map if they want it and tell me if 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.070
 they liked it or if there's something to correct or 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.660
 they want to add something else or if they 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.040
 they like the commands and they want them 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.510
 I explain a little more how the 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.180
 thing although I did it in other videos 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.710
 if we want them to give us curiosities and 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.730
 utilities in that playlist 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:35.430
 and well that's all and tell me how they 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.430
 goes the map and the other goodbye
