00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:12.750
 there was a question here the other day in the comments 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.519
 to the video that we are not waited anywhere 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.020
 there was a question about what is sausage 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:21.130
 immigration is good or bad and 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.270
 let me maybe a few words about 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:27.910
 Nastya Sausages I will talk as far as I can 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.250
 I understand I can be wrong but so here in 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.859
 my understanding of the term sausage 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:36.249
 immigration originated in the depths of the very 

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:38.800
 Immigration is not a Russian term there 

00:00:36.249 --> 00:00:42.940
 or that Ukrainian were immigrants 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:45.370
 carry ideological victims there but behind 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.420
 KGB chased them there I do not know that here 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.799
 they were one all others were 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.199
 Accordingly, such ideas do not mean 

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:55.179
 sausage that's the type they are there is not something that their 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:01:02.229
 there were pursued here how were pursued for 

00:00:55.179 --> 00:01:06.900
 idea and what to say next this term 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:10.420
 Means sausages Nastya we often meet in 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.970
 used outside emigrant 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.800
 Wednesdays here let's say people are discussing there 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.410
 it's in the Russian press there, I for example 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.630
 there are often immigration publications and 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.730
 essence there and so on and it burns here where 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.000
 there and minka and sausage migrations and so 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:27.910
 how would it be sausage migration 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.860
 it is one that is not related to the homeland 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.840
 no way here they are for sausage 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.270
 that is, roughly speaking for some 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.120
 wealth they are ready to quit 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.070
 homeland and go somewhere like these people 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.020
 without roots 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.180
 I just want to continue right there 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.650
 than there without shame and conscience there still here 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:52.260
 here in this vein 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:55.240
 so I understand that this is one of 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.460
 manifestations of diverse and multiple 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.500
 manifestations 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.970
 This is the communist philosophy 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.080
 totalitarian fascist 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:10.800
 when they say that he doesn’t like us 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.800
 homeland do not like people get tired of 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.769
 meanness from dirt from bastards zma from from 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.909
 impossible to live normal 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.340
 human life 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:23.190
 no they don't pull they don't qualify 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.049
 from this to political asylum yes then 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.420
 there is nobody pursued him because 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:30.060
 that he is there Russian or Jewish for what 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.120
 he is Baptist or Pentecostal because 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.310
 he belongs there to be sexual 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.709
 minority or he opposed it 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.900
 power in the ranks of any there 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.180
 opposition political group 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.329
 no he he is not political here he is 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.970
 here is not such that he will catch but he and he 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:50.160
 it would turn out the sausage was deprived 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.290
 opportunities to live a human life 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.500
 life and here are those who deprived him 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:03:00.120
 opportunities to live human life and 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:03.750
 those who are under the cool here so them 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:07.109
 call to go and which exist and growth and 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.190
 malice and that finger show it 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:11.549
 sausage 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:14.180
 immigrant he doesn't love his homeland yes he doesn't 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.290
 homeland does not like he does not like a bastard 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.209
 just wants to live like a normal person 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.400
 that's under all and you can 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.200
 call it sausage migration just 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.540
 keep in mind that when you say 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.299
 that sausage migration here is the type of people there 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.639
 they have a connection with their homeland and they have no 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:32.489
 they have a connection with their homeland they just 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:33.150
 that’s how I’ve got it 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.310
 endure 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.980
 endure and and pretend that nothing is 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.980
 it happens here I understand it 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.980
 is happy
