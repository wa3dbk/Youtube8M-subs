00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:02.960
 On the steering wheel 

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.340
 accepted the order 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.340
 he let go of the wheel he accelerated 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:14.509
 and the vehicle 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:15.529
 single 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:18.529
 that same year 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.349
 how do you love the car 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:26.300
 park just enough to spot the place put the wink press a button 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.509
 and the steering wheel starts running alone without you having to renege on the 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:36.219
 maneuvers is the only car in the market an Argentine that has that function and 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:41.360
 few days ago came to Cordoba are technological advances that come from 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.040
 germany but within the team of professionals that develops the system 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:50.350
 is a Cordovan researcher and professor of the technological university 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.730
 national that was the multinational of Germany and that is one of the 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.730
 developers of this novel system 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.920
 that technology is based on the use of sensors 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.920
 that can take distance from the object that surround the vehicle 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.390
 up to a certain distance 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.390
 i that way a program with a computer on board 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.950
 can assess which in the free zone where the vehicle was parked 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.400
 and can make decisions and commanded some electrical control that has 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.320
 vehicle to be able to turn the wheels and others 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.969
 as the teacher you used to 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:26.340
 many student researchers of the u have asen exchange experience of 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.609
 Knowledge with large companies from other parts of the world 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.630
 in his case he researched about the sensors and cameras that allow 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.650
 among other things that the car moves calculate spaces and seasons 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.090
 process had planned to develop an assisted design system a 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.470
 simulation 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.650
 to assess not only for more physical hunger based on these 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.290
 advisers but also 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.610
 by simulation 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.320
 because why develop 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.600
 a sensor was quite expensive 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.420
 and there were actually several possible designs 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.200
 so I wanted to simulate the process to choose which of those sensors 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.720
 Lebanese 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.250
 so then I had the luck of love from 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.329
 find that place 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:11.439
 so I could 

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:13.459
 take advantage of that experience 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.459
 in tiquexpress and we are talking about what is the reality 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.470
 these cars with these optionals in córdoba and in argentina this car with the 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:25.409
 optional included plus everything else is talked about 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:30.709
 percent according to iata in 37 thousand 900 dollars 149 thousand 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.120
 of that version according to researchers 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.569
 so that this type of productions are applied in the national automotive 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:43.680
 in the country you need three key factors industrial development kilos killed 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.560
 to the market and more budget to universities in the area of ​​robotics and 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.819
 ute image processing is being developed almost to lung a 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:59.030
 helicopter to fight fires and to be driven without a pilot so 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.659
 automatic similar to Mercedes technology but applied to a social purpose 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:09.269
 we are working on recognition of image in society recognition 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.519
 of people recognition 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.519
 despite the recognition environment 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.579
 to the driving of the PSOE pilot there is a project in the making that involves the 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:20.569
 control of 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:26.090
 flying vehicles to work on fire prevention and type of things 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.819
 presumably a cornea transplant 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:31.819
 thousands of Germans 

00:03:35.179 --> 00:03:36.930
 helped here park 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.569
 completed and charges
