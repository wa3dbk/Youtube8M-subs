00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.480
 of a category of videos of theories and 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.820
 comparisons that I would start doing 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.650
 next to the tributes and the fanfic and if 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.840

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.509

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.730

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.949

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.170
 movies and touched them alone amused 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.789
 but whether you like it or not is not the 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.130
 first time we see support and they 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.930
 I explain why in kung fu panda ' one 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.720
 we see the first appearance of poe who 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.989
 dream of being a hero this reminds us 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.149
 to someone true if that's the way 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.070
 put a zoom here is a boob boy who 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.450
 wants to show that it can be more for 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.579
 what the goal of 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.860
 become hawk like pro 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.750
 both meet challenges and obstacles 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.670
 a lot of pain but as it goes by 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.739
 history is proven to have a 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.410
 Hidden power that nobody sees at a glance 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.750
 this is the personality side now 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.550
 let's put the story both are orphans 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.770
 and they do not have full knowledge of their 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.449
 gone and are limited by their character 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.730
 while others who have more 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.199
 opportunities only see the development of 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.329
 its potential 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.670
 and to finish the video we will see 

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:11.159
 some references or imitations that 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.990
 show in the movie is not secret from 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.390
 fact it is very obvious that both of them 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.219
 they like the videos in the movie they 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.649
 shows the hatred that the furious five 

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:21.720
 they have everyone point out their shortcomings 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.640
 even if fu strives to get rid of 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.200
 eto'o this is also seen in a car 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.479
 even if it's due to the fact that naruto 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.939
 owns the kiwi is basically the same 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.280
 hatred and rejection that suffers for the palace 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.590
 but a person if he believes in google 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.899
 who like luca believes in naruto 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.000
 in the end it is the power of a roll and the one of 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:42.000
 someone dear to the two heroes the 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.649
 that give them the power to overcome this 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.720
 also taking into account that the 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.670
 Villains are former masters of arts 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.770
 martial artists who followed the path of 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.840
 wrong at the end of the two you earn a 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.000
 place next to the warriors and get 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.159
 not only acceptance also cited friendship 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.530
 in short the first kung movie 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.780
 fu panda 'basically has the plot of 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.579
