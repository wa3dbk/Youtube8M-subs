own because of the so many problems that

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.949 
own because of the so many problems that
I<00:03:36.220> have<00:03:36.250> with<00:03:36.459> this<00:03:36.549> new<00:03:36.760> computer<00:03:37.239> that<00:03:37.810> this

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
I have with this new computer that this

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.740 
I have with this new computer that this
is<00:03:38.170> not<00:03:38.530> allowed<00:03:38.769> to<00:03:39.160> do<00:03:39.280> anything<00:03:39.310> at<00:03:39.850> all<00:03:39.970> so

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
is not allowed to do anything at all so

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.340 
is not allowed to do anything at all so
so<00:03:41.470> yeah<00:03:41.620> I<00:03:41.650> mean<00:03:41.680> Sony<00:03:42.069> Vegas<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:43.900> problem

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
so yeah I mean Sony Vegas the problem

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.879 
so yeah I mean Sony Vegas the problem
was<00:03:44.560> that<00:03:44.819> my<00:03:45.819> mic<00:03:46.450> would<00:03:46.780> skip<00:03:47.170> every<00:03:47.709> three

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:47.889 
was that my mic would skip every three

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:51.059 
was that my mic would skip every three
seconds<00:03:48.310> so<00:03:48.819> I<00:03:48.850> can<00:03:49.060> use<00:03:49.389> Sony<00:03:49.600> Vegas<00:03:49.810> and<00:03:50.200> then

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
seconds so I can use Sony Vegas and then

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:52.979 
seconds so I can use Sony Vegas and then
you<00:03:51.519> know<00:03:51.609> before<00:03:51.940> we<00:03:52.090> started<00:03:52.329> everything<00:03:52.599> my

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
you know before we started everything my

we live stream and YouTube we will never
connect<00:03:59.980> so<00:04:00.670> i<00:04:00.700> have<00:04:00.849> to<00:04:00.940> do<00:04:01.060> local<00:04:01.389> recording

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
connect so i have to do local recording

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.270 
connect so i have to do local recording
and<00:04:01.959> I<00:04:01.989> did<00:04:02.200> local<00:04:02.470> recording<00:04:02.859> but<00:04:03.040> i<00:04:03.069> found

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
and I did local recording but i found

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.670 
and I did local recording but i found
out<00:04:03.519> that<00:04:03.579> it's<00:04:04.090> way<00:04:04.329> too<00:04:04.389> laggy<00:04:04.750> it<00:04:05.380> still

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
out that it's way too laggy it still

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.589 
out that it's way too laggy it still
lags<00:04:05.889> even<00:04:06.280> though<00:04:06.400> i<00:04:06.430> have<00:04:06.639> a<00:04:06.669> big<00:04:07.180> bigger

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 
lags even though i have a big bigger

you<00:04:09.340> know<00:04:09.459> gigabytes<00:04:09.970> or<00:04:10.120> whatever<00:04:10.480> you<00:04:10.599> know

you know gigabytes or whatever you know
I<00:04:10.780> think<00:04:10.870> it's<00:04:11.200> supposed<00:04:11.530> to<00:04:11.560> run<00:04:11.769> faster<00:04:12.310> now

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
I think it's supposed to run faster now

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.710 
I think it's supposed to run faster now
but<00:04:12.730> it<00:04:13.599> never<00:04:14.080> ran<00:04:14.290> faster<00:04:14.769> than<00:04:15.600> then<00:04:16.600> my

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
but it never ran faster than then my

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.060 
but it never ran faster than then my
