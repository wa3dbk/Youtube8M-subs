00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
I've got our timeline and we can expand

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.250 
I've got our timeline and we can expand
that<00:02:25.700> and<00:02:28.489> you<00:02:29.489> see<00:02:29.760> by<00:02:29.940> expanding<00:02:30.599> it<00:02:30.750> where

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
that and you see by expanding it where

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.500 
that and you see by expanding it where
these<00:02:31.440> things<00:02:31.799> line<00:02:32.069> up<00:02:32.099> now<00:02:32.670> I<00:02:32.910> want<00:02:33.239> them<00:02:33.450> to

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510
