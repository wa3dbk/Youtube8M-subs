00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:13.650
 and then look here LÃ©o welcome to 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:17.310
 tech news and the challenge and announced that it will 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.130
 remain completely free in 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.180
 development, for example India, if 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.080
 fits this profile and there the 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.099
 application will continue fully 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.710
 free 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.009
 the person will not have to pay later 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.930
 a year of use this will happen by 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.690
 there for example because most of the 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.809
 people do not have a credit card or 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.899
 debit card already in Brazil that is 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.809
 considered the developing country is 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.120
 I do not know why here it will continue 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.329
 It's how I paid so you'll have to use 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.180
 It's a free year and then the year you go. 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.070
 have to pay and about 99 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:01.680
 cents gives more or less 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:04.019
 two reais and sixty cents 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.510
 copenhagen company is doing a test 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.780
 rocket launch and this test 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.990
 simply went wrong from a fault in the 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:17.250
 system and caught fire at all if you see 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.650
 the video is in normal mode ie 30 fps 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.770
 then you see that not much fun one 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.659
 normal video of the rocket catching fire 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.540
 The interesting thing about this video is that they 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.090
 recorded this explosion with a pro and will 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.700
 put a video in slow motion the 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.729
 video was sensational this way and 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.460
 it's really worth seeing if you want to see 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.040
 The full video link will be on the 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.649
 description and if the coach stays here 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.640
 A big hug and until the next 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.640
 technical 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:55.829
 if youtube 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:59.039
 it's worth knowing the solar network 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.920
 offers them a contract in Portuguese 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:05.069
 support in Portuguese as well as a 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.619
 minimum payment of US $ 1 or 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:08.190
 your channel made only a dollar in that 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.549
 month 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.560
 in the other month you receive that one dollar 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:17.810
