00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:17.909
 do not ask 

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:20.369
 there are more powerful countries 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.619
 I have done and appeared oversized because Chile is the alter ego of triumph 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.609
 percent is in any case followed with Argentina are omar pouso de chile 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:31.079
 Pedro 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:32.450
 recent nadal 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.150
 before they did not have 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.910
 like argentina and they do not have rents of the repertoire with argentina 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.720
 3 chili for us important for the consistories 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.830
 certainly mistrust about which have not been regrettably deleted nor at the level of 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.250
 liquidity of the whole at least having public piñón throughout history 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.420
 we have also involved a border dispute at this time 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.840
 that luckily the government however that in the Gothic that analyze first 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.280
 by institutional but that of the international criminal court of justice 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.770
 percent and the savior 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.370
 the Argentine government expressed 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.680
 and secondly if it is with a joint decision 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.970
 this agreement should handle agenda items by what they call ropes 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.940
 separate says the meter be 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.970
 in other words you will avoid 100 border dispute with also the 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.260
 rest of the people 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.040
 the conflictive issue therefore prevents cooperation in other areas 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.110
 percent however 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.130
 by the way is that for this concept 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:37.970
 rarefied 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.510
 this mayor economic hug with chile his politically sensitive flight 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.140
 a survey of the Catholic University of Chile and Lima and we are making a 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.270
 similar bet the problem is that nationally 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.390
 but a survey that has revealed 50 percent of the 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.300
 limeños 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.800
 they see with good eyes the foreign investor in Peru 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.530
 only 50% of getting the best way foreign investment from 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:04.310
 Chile 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.610
 percent which is symptomatic not because the walk in English has a 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.619
 third bonus 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.029
 I understand his character to reverse a statement 

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:16.369
 but Chile is still a sensitive issue in the economic relationship with Chile 

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:19.029
 it still has political consequences 

00:02:19.029 --> 00:02:21.859
 and by the nature of the bilateral relationship 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:26.249
 idealistic idac of some military sectors of some sectors including 

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:31.340
 of the castle even though minorities are not publicly recognized but there are 

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:36.339
 of some opinion leaders ice-t public opinion that the investment 

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:40.219
 foreign exchange from Chile is a sort of spearhead for a 

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:44.899
 penetration like mika that would be the prelude to political influence in 

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:48.449
 the calculations signatures hallucinated moment to conflict 

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:52.469
 so I think that is not true but the point is that as long as they are not resolved 

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:53.529
 the topics 

00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:55.930
 in the pending political agenda 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.069
 especially the boundary issue 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:03.749
 p the bilateral relationship with chile will continue to be percent and a relationship 

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:04.459
 from ee 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.210
 dt to be 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.270
 1 based on a certain mutual suspicion
