00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:04.500
 the best known works of piano literature Percent sure Bach 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.469
 goldberg variations and very young gets to Kurds is Dennis Partridge 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:11.859
 but has adorned these variations for his instrument 

00:00:12.529 --> 00:00:15.940
 that's just unbelievable on this instrument itself 

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:18.939
 most complicated variations live 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.040
 I did not have to compare anything well that's it 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.060
 Why 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.010
 besides, they were bought and it is actually a full complete 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.810
 possible, of course, a few register changes that means you have 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.310
 theirs appear to have been businesses Fichtel Jean Todt also buys 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.550
 so i really did not have to work completely 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.270
 Of course I was immediately interested in one thing 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.060
 what is the biggest challenge of this project? 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.570
 would say that on 4 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.570
 it sounds the easiest 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.520
 that Swedes bring silver 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.420
 and compassion 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.120
 say that is one 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.710
 Piece where you turn 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.710
 Spohn would like to think 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.019
 percent 

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:20.119
 percent 

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:52.349
 For me, this work is life-saving 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.969
 black heart »so many different 

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:58.079
 Perspectives and it would be 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:02:59.869
 Chief already moments 

00:02:59.869 --> 00:03:01.629
 and of course 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:03.519
 happy moments 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.739
 and I believe that Bach 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.629
 also to ears 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:10.629
 tractor 

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:42.309
 Massa is also the former Yugoslavia 

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:46.449
 and there the accordion is the main instrument to benefit in the future 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:51.689
 stuck on everyone and I have as 4 5 4 just hisses this Balkan music 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:52.649
 belongs 

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:53.939
 and 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:56.949
 there was nothing to me that I just wanted 

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:59.949
 play this instrument 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:11.609
 "I knew that my goal in the first or second grade of the light was like 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.609
 Familiar people reported 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:34.039
 so wear it in the end 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:35.490
 "I have lost weight 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.080
 the classical music 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.020
 to me 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.330
 and of course that too 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.680
 a prerequisite to study 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.990
 and at the age of 16 I started studying to move to Würzburg 

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:52.279
 SC Verl is developed 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.040
 After all, a little more really good is that he is between the 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.580
 Goldberg variations repeatedly since then, he is not a word 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.830
 he makes the bridge, so to speak 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.830
 in the modern man 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.759
 until last 

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:56.789
 new music and back to 

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:59.789
 Of course, in the beginning, it's a shocking experience 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.229
 Normally you are already representing, now the fleet is coming 

00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:08.069
 and yet that is completely different 

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:09.379
 and then 

00:06:09.379 --> 00:06:11.939
 it is of course at the beginning 

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:13.150
 quite 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.210
 getting used to, I would say that they say 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.450
 And so you have to be on one as well, of course, a bit 

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:22.599
 not the lines of new music so easy 

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:25.589
 be open for new things 

00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:26.689
 ca 

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:29.689
 more 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.610
 Obama he campaigned 

00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:38.749
 dollar 

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:47.309
 but with them will also be with many dead 

00:06:47.309 --> 00:06:49.939
 Music addressed as it will have played 

00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:52.069
 you go through hell or you come in Hamm
