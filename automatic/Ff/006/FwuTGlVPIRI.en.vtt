than<00:02:19.349> the<00:02:19.530> 14<00:02:20.040> model<00:02:20.489> feels<00:02:21.390> more<00:02:21.780> stable

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.960 

that's<00:02:26.900> realistic<00:02:27.230> on<00:02:27.620> kind<00:02:28.489> of<00:02:28.550> riding<00:02:28.849> we're

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.290 
that's realistic on kind of riding we're
doing<00:02:29.180> right<00:02:29.330> here<00:02:29.620> and<00:02:30.620> I'm<00:02:30.950> just

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.120 
doing right here and I'm just
just<00:02:32.690> brainwashed<00:02:32.960> by<00:02:33.350> reading<00:02:33.680> the<00:02:33.800> specs

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
just brainwashed by reading the specs

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.380 
just brainwashed by reading the specs
but

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
but

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.180

around

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:20.150 

thank<00:03:07.090> God<00:03:07.270> everything<00:03:07.450> is<00:03:07.959> so<00:03:08.410> about

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.670 

let's<00:03:58.070> downshift<00:03:58.550> right<00:03:58.760> there<00:03:59.000> and<00:03:59.180> that<00:03:59.330> was

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
let's downshift right there and that was

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:09.530 
let's downshift right there and that was
really<00:04:00.680> cool

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:23.080 

snap<00:04:10.170> crackle<00:04:10.470> pop

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.520 

I<00:04:23.150> can<00:04:24.160> feel<00:04:25.160> the<00:04:25.310> weight<00:04:25.430> difference

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
I can feel the weight difference

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.890 
I can feel the weight difference
the<00:04:27.890> bike<00:04:28.130> feels<00:04:28.460> better<00:04:28.760> this<00:04:29.060> is

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
the bike feels better this is

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.510
