00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:13.090

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.570
 when this means this point and meter 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.290

 different celebrations that are there 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.159
 we can see the goal 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.300
 and as I said if they have to fit it 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.460
 they have to go to help of buttons 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:04.100
 celebrations and in this case it says of l 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.350
