00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.860
 and 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.480
 it seems to me that monterrey carries a very 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:19.210
 good step this place is strong 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.730
 also and we know his court of his 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.930
 same hobby are two teams 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.920
 we are fighting the upper part of the 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:28.060
 table so good is a match that 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.800
 generates good expectations and that 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.210
 we have to try to do the 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.180
 things well that is a team that also 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:37.000
 is fighting practically for the same 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:40.540
 that we do not think it's a game 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.750
 determinant nor much less but but 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.780
 yes it can be a good parameter 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:50.320
 but good for also precisely the 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:55.140
 guide for what are we 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:59.210
 what it requires is to go to Monterrey 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.010
 with the squad he has with the fans 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.409
 because ultimately we want both 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.240
 be up we want it seems that the 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.280
 two fight for a place in the cup 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.630
 liberators then are are objectives 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.950
 we have, and of course, what 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.330
 we have to fight on the field like 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.490
 players as a team we consider 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.770
 forever 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.060
 believe a little more today we are in a 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.130
 good position but we do not settle 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.759
 with that we want the team to follow 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.860
 growing and for that you need 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:30.450
 victories wins comes a week 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:33.060
 complex from where possibly we 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.929
 we play we play a lot so there's 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.869
 that being well, you have to be 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:38.610
 disposition of the equipment to 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.590
 good to aspire every day a little more 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.409
 but we do not have to lose sight of every 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.329
 one of the games and work 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.539
 work them to them in a way 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:51.390
 differentiated we can not be thinking 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.009
 for example in chivas when we have to 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.780
 go to a key match in monterrey 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.759
 then you have to be calm there 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.679
 to keep working I do not think 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.039
 we have to wait only 24 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:04.799
 points would play a lot with luck 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:06.359
 today we are in a position where we have 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.729
 sown a crop of a good 

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:11.280
 amount for what goes of the tournament 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.450
 then we have to aspire to more myself 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.780
 I think the goal is to be as 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.060
 high possible the previous tournament was very 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.670
 difficult on the fly it had to 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.069
 form a team 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.310
 to fight for not to descend that is 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:29.040
 had to do strong in adversity 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.860
 that each game was very demanding 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.900
 and good and little by little we left 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.670
 amalgamating to achieve that 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.250
 objective 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.560
 with a group of players that left the 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.090
 life in each of the trainings and 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.300
 good today things started to come out a 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.870
 little better perhaps with a more 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:52.270
 vast and with much replacement with much 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.720
 internal competence I understand that each 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.400
 party is important and the 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.350
 operating each result of those that 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.010
 we have to where the pattern of what 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.510
 that we are 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:08.540
 then I think we 're fine but 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:10.040
 it is not time to say good this 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:14.090
 we are for to fight a title 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.250
 ourselves with determination 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.709
 with operation as I said we have 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.409
 to go showing it if they want to put me 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:24.680
 the favorite welcome this we accept 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:26.239
 we will try to channel it for the 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.430
 benefit of the team and if not 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.700
 we will also work to fight to be the 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.700
 top
