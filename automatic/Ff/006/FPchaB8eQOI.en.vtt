00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:41.399 
the existing grips and then you know the
old<00:01:40.450> trick<00:01:40.659> would<00:01:40.810> be<00:01:40.840> to<00:01:40.929> use<00:01:41.109> a<00:01:41.139> little<00:01:41.200> bit

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
old trick would be to use a little bit

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:42.719 
old trick would be to use a little bit
of<00:01:41.499> hairspray<00:01:41.649> to<00:01:42.039> slide<00:01:42.249> this<00:01:42.399> thing<00:01:42.579> on

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
of hairspray to slide this thing on

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.809 
of hairspray to slide this thing on
quickly<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:44.439> works<00:01:44.679> also<00:01:45.249> to<00:01:45.399> compressed

00:01:45.809 --> 00:01:45.819 
quickly that works also to compressed

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:47.069 
quickly that works also to compressed
air<00:01:45.969> as<00:01:46.119> your<00:01:46.270> friends<00:01:46.539> we've<00:01:46.689> actually<00:01:46.810> got<00:01:47.049> a
