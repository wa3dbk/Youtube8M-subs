00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:08.220
 Hello and welcome this time 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.900
 I am in mp3 and I would like to 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:16.080
 Show this time today like this 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:17.609
 Aviator comes out of this door and yes 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.410
 my admittance program is traveling 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.270
 little bit on the computer 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:27.260
 I hope that I am still good 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.260
 you have to be done you have to 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.140
 you have to look in this direction and 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:47.059
 already said it is hard you have to 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.059
 actually practiced a bit 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:57.550
 now that's exactly what you will imagine 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.550
 it works well with the sky 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:11.130
 so are super mood a bit 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:13.070
 obliquely passed on lakic should now 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.450
 we have the Hochrhein 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.960
 yes and that was not already 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.670
 again 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:33.210
 you see tactics so now you can go here 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:36.060
 you can do a lot 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:40.580
 one does not do one can not one there also one 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:44.399
 can one can distribute something one may 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:47.009
 very nice here you fall through this is 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:52.280
 Of course not so great what we but with 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:56.250
 our tactics can change and 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.899
 You can do better up here 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.920
 up on the tribune 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:04.530
 You have to print in this direction 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:07.460
 and then not at this 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.460
 stay extreme 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.610
 but not me personally 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.569
 hinbekommen 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.480
 or what they think I do too 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.720
 can not here in front of a parcel 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.720
 allow on 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.489
 now that I have very wide partner 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:27.069
 Unfortunately I can not show 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.939
