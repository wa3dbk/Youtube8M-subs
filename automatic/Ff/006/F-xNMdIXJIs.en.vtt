when<00:00:01.410> Newton<00:00:01.680> was<00:00:01.949> thinking<00:00:02.310> about<00:00:02.399> his

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
when Newton was thinking about his

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.550 
when Newton was thinking about his
theory<00:00:03.030> of<00:00:03.120> gravity<00:00:03.570> he<00:00:03.750> didn't<00:00:04.020> simply<00:00:04.230> want

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
theory of gravity he didn't simply want

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.590 
theory of gravity he didn't simply want
an<00:00:04.740> explanation<00:00:05.460> of<00:00:06.000> it<00:00:06.120> he<00:00:06.240> wanted<00:00:06.480> a

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
an explanation of it he wanted a

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.540 
an explanation of it he wanted a
mathematical<00:00:07.470> explanation<00:00:07.740> of<00:00:08.280> it<00:00:08.400> an

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
mathematical explanation of it an

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.850 
mathematical explanation of it an
equation<00:00:08.910> that<00:00:09.360> would<00:00:09.809> precisely<00:00:10.230> describe

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
equation that would precisely describe

equation that would precisely describe
the<00:00:11.070> force<00:00:11.280> of<00:00:11.429> gravity<00:00:11.849> and<00:00:11.940> he<00:00:12.690> reasoned

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
the force of gravity and he reasoned

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.680 
the force of gravity and he reasoned
that<00:00:13.320> it<00:00:13.679> would<00:00:13.799> probably<00:00:14.429> be<00:00:14.639> an<00:00:14.849> inverse

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
that it would probably be an inverse

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.680 
that it would probably be an inverse
square<00:00:15.990> law<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:17.190> you<00:00:18.150> should<00:00:18.300> understand

flashlights work the light rays the

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.630 
flashlights work the light rays the
light<00:00:37.380> rays<00:00:37.590> spread<00:00:38.040> out<00:00:38.250> from<00:00:38.489> the

light rays spread out from the
flashlight<00:00:39.120> as<00:00:39.300> they<00:00:39.540> travel<00:00:39.989> so<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.739> farther

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
flashlight as they travel so the farther

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.130 
flashlight as they travel so the farther
away<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.550> get<00:00:41.879> from<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.239> light<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.660> more

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
away you get from the light the more

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.580 
away you get from the light the more
spread<00:00:43.680> out<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.370> let's<00:00:45.270> imagine<00:00:45.590> this

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
spread out it is let's imagine this

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.110 
spread out it is let's imagine this
flashlight<00:00:46.890> sitting<00:00:47.460> here<00:00:47.610> emitting<00:00:47.969> light

flashlight sitting here emitting light
and<00:00:48.390> these<00:00:48.539> are<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.840> light<00:00:49.020> rays<00:00:49.260> they're

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
and these are the light rays they're

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.240 
and these are the light rays they're
traveling<00:00:50.010> off<00:00:50.160> in<00:00:50.480> this<00:00:51.480> direction<00:00:51.660> and

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
traveling off in this direction and

00:00:52.250 --> 00:01:02.479 
traveling off in this direction and
let's<00:00:53.250> imagine<00:00:53.430> we<00:00:53.760> place<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.270> screen<00:00:54.629> here<00:01:01.489> so

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
let's imagine we place a screen here so

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.429 
let's imagine we place a screen here so
the<00:01:02.730> light<00:01:02.969> lands<00:01:03.510> on<00:01:03.660> this<00:01:03.840> screen<00:01:04.170> and

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
the light lands on this screen and

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.370 
the light lands on this screen and
illuminates<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.750> suppose<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:07.049> screen

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
illuminates it and suppose this screen

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.969 
illuminates it and suppose this screen
is<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.650> distance<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.810> one<00:01:09.810> meter<00:01:10.080> away<00:01:10.380> from<00:01:10.650> the

imagine these rays spreading out you can

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.020 
imagine these rays spreading out you can
see<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.710> they're<00:01:28.890> there<00:01:29.280> they're<00:01:29.729> straight

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
see that they're there they're straight

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.730 
see that they're there they're straight
lines<00:01:30.299> they're<00:01:30.689> linear<00:01:31.020> but<00:01:31.320> they<00:01:31.409> all<00:01:31.560> have

lines they're linear but they all have
different<00:01:32.009> angles<00:01:32.670> if<00:01:33.000> we<00:01:33.600> were<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.840> go

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
different angles if we were to go

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.719 
different angles if we were to go
instead<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.439> one<00:01:34.710> meter<00:01:34.920> away<00:01:35.220> if<00:01:35.400> we<00:01:35.520> were<00:01:35.610> to

instead of one meter away if we were to

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.310 
instead of one meter away if we were to
go<00:01:35.850> twice<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.689> far<00:01:37.280> two<00:01:38.280> meters<00:01:38.549> away<00:01:39.320> you

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
go twice that far two meters away you

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.660 
go twice that far two meters away you
should<00:01:40.380> be<00:01:40.590> able<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.799> see<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.340> screen

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
should be able to see that the screen

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.690 
should be able to see that the screen
placed<00:01:42.270> twice<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.990> distance<00:01:43.140> away<00:01:43.590> in<00:01:43.860> order

placed twice the distance away in order

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.569 
placed twice the distance away in order
to<00:01:44.820> catch<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.180> same<00:01:45.720> light<00:01:46.110> rays<00:01:46.430> will<00:01:47.430> have

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
to catch the same light rays will have

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:53.350 
to catch the same light rays will have
to<00:01:47.729> be<00:01:47.850> twice<00:01:48.270> as<00:01:48.540> wide<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.280> twice<00:01:50.280> as<00:01:50.549> tall<00:01:51.890> so

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
to be twice as wide and twice as tall so

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.590 
to be twice as wide and twice as tall so
so<00:01:54.360> if<00:01:54.570> this<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.020> certain<00:01:55.700> width<00:01:56.700> there<00:01:57.210> the

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
so if this is a certain width there the

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.389 
so if this is a certain width there the
screen<00:01:57.960> is<00:01:58.079> going<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.290> be<00:01:58.380> twice<00:01:58.619> as<00:01:58.680> wide<00:01:59.070> and

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
screen is going to be twice as wide and

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.980 
screen is going to be twice as wide and
if<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.579> screen<00:01:59.759> has<00:01:59.939> a<00:01:59.969> certain<00:02:00.329> height<00:02:00.540> here

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
if the screen has a certain height here

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.740 
if the screen has a certain height here
this<00:02:01.680> screen<00:02:02.009> twice<00:02:02.280> as<00:02:02.520> far<00:02:02.670> away<00:02:02.969> will<00:02:03.600> have

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
this screen twice as far away will have

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.810 
this screen twice as far away will have
to<00:02:03.899> be<00:02:04.020> twice<00:02:04.560> as<00:02:04.770> high<00:02:04.890> in<00:02:04.920> order<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.610> catch

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
to be twice as high in order to catch

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.719 
to be twice as high in order to catch
the<00:02:05.850> exact<00:02:06.659> same<00:02:06.990> light<00:02:07.920> rays

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.449 

and<00:02:11.360> so<00:02:12.319> as<00:02:12.500> you<00:02:12.650> can<00:02:12.770> see<00:02:12.950> in<00:02:13.069> the<00:02:13.160> picture

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
and so as you can see in the picture

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.699 
and so as you can see in the picture
this<00:02:14.000> screen<00:02:14.390> this<00:02:14.569> twice<00:02:14.840> as<00:02:14.989> far<00:02:15.170> away<00:02:15.319> is

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
this screen this twice as far away is

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.759 
this screen this twice as far away is
four<00:02:16.220> times<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:17.060> size<00:02:17.239> it's<00:02:18.019> twice<00:02:18.410> as<00:02:18.440> wide

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
four times the size it's twice as wide

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:21.130 
four times the size it's twice as wide
and<00:02:19.099> twice<00:02:19.280> as<00:02:19.489> tall<00:02:19.700> so<00:02:20.330> it's<00:02:20.510> as<00:02:20.629> if<00:02:20.660> we<00:02:20.930> had

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
and twice as tall so it's as if we had

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.890 
and twice as tall so it's as if we had
four<00:02:21.739> of<00:02:22.099> these<00:02:22.250> smaller<00:02:22.580> screens<00:02:22.970> so<00:02:23.720> the

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
four of these smaller screens so the

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.540 
four of these smaller screens so the
light<00:02:24.140> now<00:02:24.530> landing<00:02:24.890> remember<00:02:25.099> it's<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.280> same

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
light now landing remember it's the same

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.309 
light now landing remember it's the same
light<00:02:25.879> all<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.629> light<00:02:26.810> that<00:02:27.019> would<00:02:27.170> have

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
light all the light that would have

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.949 
light all the light that would have
landed<00:02:27.650> on<00:02:27.769> this<00:02:27.950> screen<00:02:28.280> if<00:02:28.519> that<00:02:29.269> screen<00:02:29.810> is

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
landed on this screen if that screen is

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.080 
landed on this screen if that screen is
then<00:02:30.140> replaced<00:02:30.410> by<00:02:30.680> this<00:02:30.830> other<00:02:31.130> one<00:02:31.400> that

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
then replaced by this other one that

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.330 
then replaced by this other one that
same<00:02:32.450> light<00:02:32.720> is<00:02:32.959> spread<00:02:33.410> out<00:02:33.440> over<00:02:33.800> an<00:02:34.099> area

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
same light is spread out over an area

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.190 
same light is spread out over an area
four<00:02:34.970> times<00:02:35.000> as<00:02:35.690> big

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
four times as big

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.339 
four times as big
so<00:02:36.739> the<00:02:36.920> illumination<00:02:37.670> on<00:02:37.880> this<00:02:38.780> second

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
so the illumination on this second

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.890 
so the illumination on this second
screen<00:02:39.620> or<00:02:39.860> a<00:02:39.920> screen<00:02:40.549> that's<00:02:41.180> twice<00:02:41.450> as<00:02:41.720> far

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
screen or a screen that's twice as far

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.370 
screen or a screen that's twice as far
away<00:02:42.200> is<00:02:42.530> only<00:02:43.190> going<00:02:43.519> to<00:02:43.700> be<00:02:43.849> one<00:02:44.299> fourth<00:02:44.780> the

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
away is only going to be one fourth the

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.140 
away is only going to be one fourth the
illumination<00:02:46.040> on<00:02:46.220> the<00:02:46.670> screen<00:02:46.910> that<00:02:47.060> was

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
illumination on the screen that was

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.259 
illumination on the screen that was
closer<00:02:48.220> continuing<00:02:49.220> that<00:02:49.310> same<00:02:49.579> reason<00:02:50.000> if<00:02:50.180> we

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
closer continuing that same reason if we

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.339 
closer continuing that same reason if we
go<00:02:51.130> out<00:02:52.130> three<00:02:52.849> times<00:02:53.180> as<00:02:53.510> far<00:02:53.900> as<00:02:54.140> we

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:54.349 
go out three times as far as we

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.490 
go out three times as far as we
originally<00:02:54.739> were<00:02:55.660> then<00:02:56.660> to<00:02:56.840> catch<00:02:57.019> the<00:02:57.290> same

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
originally were then to catch the same

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.699 
originally were then to catch the same
light<00:02:57.769> rays<00:02:58.150> we<00:02:59.150> need<00:02:59.390> a<00:02:59.660> screen<00:03:00.500> that<00:03:00.530> is

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
light rays we need a screen that is

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.449 
light rays we need a screen that is
three<00:03:01.250> times<00:03:01.549> as<00:03:01.819> wide<00:03:02.090> and<00:03:02.950> three<00:03:03.950> times<00:03:04.160> as

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
three times as wide and three times as

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.059 
three times as wide and three times as
tall<00:03:04.700> and<00:03:05.230> you<00:03:06.230> should<00:03:06.410> be<00:03:06.500> able<00:03:06.560> to<00:03:06.680> see<00:03:06.860> that

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
tall and you should be able to see that

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:12.190 
tall and you should be able to see that
this<00:03:07.220> screen<00:03:07.579> is<00:03:07.849> like<00:03:08.780> nine<00:03:09.290> of<00:03:10.750> these<00:03:11.750> little

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
this screen is like nine of these little

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.090 
this screen is like nine of these little
ones<00:03:12.549> so<00:03:13.569> increasing<00:03:14.569> the<00:03:14.720> distance<00:03:15.200> here<00:03:15.590> by

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
ones so increasing the distance here by

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.720 
ones so increasing the distance here by
a<00:03:16.130> factor<00:03:16.639> of<00:03:16.670> three<00:03:17.500> has<00:03:18.500> required<00:03:18.980> an<00:03:19.310> area

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
a factor of three has required an area

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.720 
a factor of three has required an area
nine<00:03:20.420> times<00:03:20.930> is<00:03:21.260> great<00:03:21.530> to<00:03:22.069> capture<00:03:22.430> the<00:03:22.549> same

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
nine times is great to capture the same

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.509 
nine times is great to capture the same
light<00:03:23.030> in<00:03:23.239> other<00:03:24.049> words<00:03:24.290> the<00:03:24.829> light<00:03:25.040> that<00:03:25.370> was

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
light in other words the light that was

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.110 
light in other words the light that was
landing<00:03:26.030> on<00:03:26.180> this<00:03:26.420> original<00:03:26.900> screen<00:03:27.579> at<00:03:28.579> this

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
landing on this original screen at this

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.180 
landing on this original screen at this
distance<00:03:29.540> is<00:03:29.810> going<00:03:29.959> to<00:03:30.109> be<00:03:30.200> spread<00:03:30.709> out<00:03:30.889> over

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
distance is going to be spread out over

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.890 
distance is going to be spread out over
nine<00:03:31.609> times<00:03:32.030> as<00:03:32.780> much<00:03:33.079> area<00:03:34.510> so<00:03:35.510> this<00:03:35.690> screen

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
nine times as much area so this screen

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.559 
nine times as much area so this screen
will<00:03:36.109> be<00:03:36.200> less<00:03:36.709> brightly<00:03:37.220> illuminated<00:03:37.489> and<00:03:38.150> we

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
will be less brightly illuminated and we

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:40.300 
will be less brightly illuminated and we
can<00:03:38.720> we<00:03:38.989> can<00:03:39.139> see<00:03:39.290> mathematically<00:03:40.040> it<00:03:40.100> will<00:03:40.190> be

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
can we can see mathematically it will be

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.729 
can we can see mathematically it will be
exactly<00:03:40.609> one<00:03:41.030> ninth<00:03:41.900> as<00:03:42.170> brightly

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
exactly one ninth as brightly

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.460 
exactly one ninth as brightly
illuminated<00:03:42.980> as<00:03:43.670> at<00:03:44.600> the<00:03:44.750> original<00:03:45.139> distance

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
illuminated as at the original distance

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.289 
illuminated as at the original distance
and<00:03:45.650> you<00:03:46.010> can<00:03:46.160> continue<00:03:46.579> this<00:03:46.700> relationship

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
and you can continue this relationship

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.490 
and you can continue this relationship
at<00:03:47.480> four<00:03:48.230> four<00:03:48.680> times<00:03:49.040> the<00:03:49.609> original<00:03:49.730> distance
