be<00:01:57.030> 1/2<00:01:57.240> inch<00:01:57.420> deep<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.140> then<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.069> tongue<00:01:59.250> is

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
be 1/2 inch deep and then the tongue is

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.710 
be 1/2 inch deep and then the tongue is
going<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.610> be<00:01:59.729> about<00:01:59.909> sixteenth<00:02:00.360> of<00:02:00.420> an<00:02:00.599> inch

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
going to be about sixteenth of an inch

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.719 
going to be about sixteenth of an inch
shorter<00:02:01.439> because<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:01.950> don't<00:02:02.189> want<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.490> tongue

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
shorter because I don't want the tongue

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.779 
shorter because I don't want the tongue
to<00:02:03.390> be<00:02:03.569> battling<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:04.020> out<00:02:04.140> on<00:02:04.200> my<00:02:04.560> mortise<00:02:04.920> so

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
to be battling it out on my mortise so

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:10.460 
to be battling it out on my mortise so
to<00:02:05.849> mark<00:02:06.360> out<00:02:06.539> my<00:02:08.720> mortise<00:02:09.720> here<00:02:10.049> or<00:02:10.289> the

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
to mark out my mortise here or the

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.860 
to mark out my mortise here or the
groove<00:02:10.679> I'm<00:02:11.459> going<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.700> find<00:02:11.880> Center<00:02:12.239> and<00:02:12.630> I

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
groove I'm going to find Center and I

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.259 
groove I'm going to find Center and I
want<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.319> groove<00:02:13.530> to<00:02:13.680> be<00:02:13.769> approximately<00:02:14.370> 5/16

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
want the groove to be approximately 5/16

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.030 
want the groove to be approximately 5/16
it<00:02:15.810> doesn't<00:02:16.140> have<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.380> be<00:02:16.440> exact<00:02:16.799> this

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
it doesn't have to be exact this

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.400 
it doesn't have to be exact this
approximate<00:02:17.579> so<00:02:18.269> I'm<00:02:18.720> just<00:02:18.930> going<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.140> put<00:02:19.290> my

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
approximate so I'm just going to put my

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.930 
approximate so I'm just going to put my
ruler<00:02:19.680> here<00:02:20.390> find<00:02:21.390> Center<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:21.959> maybe<00:02:22.530> the

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
ruler here find Center and maybe the

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.160 
ruler here find Center and maybe the
5/32<00:02:23.940> on<00:02:24.030> each<00:02:24.180> side<00:02:24.420> I<00:02:24.450> would<00:02:24.690> give<00:02:24.870> me<00:02:24.959> about

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
5/32 on each side I would give me about

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.240 
5/32 on each side I would give me about
5/16<00:02:26.540> now<00:02:27.540> it's<00:02:27.930> very<00:02:28.140> important<00:02:28.560> that<00:02:28.709> when

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
5/16 now it's very important that when

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.030 
5/16 now it's very important that when
I'm<00:02:29.370> cutting<00:02:29.640> that<00:02:30.299> I<00:02:30.329> would<00:02:30.569> cut<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:31.799> top

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
I'm cutting that I would cut the top

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.110 
I'm cutting that I would cut the top
mark<00:02:32.310> off<00:02:32.549> first

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
mark off first

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.170 
mark off first
because<00:02:34.010> if<00:02:35.010> for<00:02:35.310> any<00:02:35.400> reason<00:02:35.519> if<00:02:36.060> my

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
because if for any reason if my

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.240 
because if for any reason if my
brickwork<00:02:36.600> comes<00:02:36.780> off<00:02:36.959> the<00:02:37.109> table<00:02:37.260> I'll<00:02:38.040> be

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
brickwork comes off the table I'll be

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.020 
brickwork comes off the table I'll be
cutting<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:39.299> bottom<00:02:40.019> side<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.380> wayside<00:02:41.030> and

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
cutting the bottom side the wayside and

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.520 
cutting the bottom side the wayside and
there's<00:02:42.389> no<00:02:42.600> way<00:02:42.780> that<00:02:42.930> you<00:02:43.049> can<00:02:43.200> ever<00:02:43.319> push

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
there's no way that you can ever push

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.500 
there's no way that you can ever push
hard<00:02:43.769> enough<00:02:43.859> they<00:02:44.160> will<00:02:44.310> ever<00:02:44.430> cut<00:02:45.030> past<00:02:45.299> the

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
hard enough they will ever cut past the

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.479 
hard enough they will ever cut past the
line<00:02:45.690> on<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.930> top<00:02:46.139> because<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.650> table<00:02:47.130> will

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
line on the top because the table will

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.460 
line on the top because the table will
prevent<00:02:47.880> you<00:02:48.000> from<00:02:48.060> doing<00:02:48.269> that<00:02:48.510> so<00:02:49.200> I'm<00:02:49.319> going

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
prevent you from doing that so I'm going

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.599 
prevent you from doing that so I'm going
to<00:02:49.530> go<00:02:49.620> to<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.829> router<00:02:50.010> table<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:50.430> I'm<00:02:50.519> going

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:50.609 
to go to the router table and I'm going

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:52.940 
to go to the router table and I'm going
to<00:02:50.700> set<00:02:50.819> up<00:02:50.850> my<00:02:50.989> router<00:02:51.989> bit<00:02:52.260> to<00:02:52.500> be<00:02:52.620> cutting<00:02:52.859> my

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
to set up my router bit to be cutting my

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.640 
to set up my router bit to be cutting my
top<00:02:53.250> cut<00:02:53.850> first<00:02:54.060> okay<00:02:54.359> and<00:02:54.660> then<00:02:55.230> I<00:02:55.319> want<00:02:55.530> to

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
top cut first okay and then I want to

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.460 
top cut first okay and then I want to
start<00:02:56.120> inch<00:02:57.120> away<00:02:57.269> from<00:02:57.420> each<00:02:57.720> side<00:02:57.989> I'm<00:02:58.230> going

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
start inch away from each side I'm going

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.440 
start inch away from each side I'm going
to<00:02:58.530> start<00:02:58.709> right<00:02:58.859> about<00:02:59.160> here<00:02:59.639> and<00:02:59.730> I'm<00:03:00.329> going

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
to start right about here and I'm going

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.720 
to start right about here and I'm going
to<00:03:00.480> route<00:03:00.660> across<00:03:01.019> and<00:03:01.380> I'll<00:03:02.100> just<00:03:02.340> stop<00:03:02.549> over

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
to route across and I'll just stop over

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.610 
to route across and I'll just stop over
there<00:03:02.760> and<00:03:02.910> not<00:03:03.030> just<00:03:03.060> pull<00:03:03.389> out<00:03:03.420> I'll<00:03:04.200> flip<00:03:04.500> it

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
there and not just pull out I'll flip it

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.400 
there and not just pull out I'll flip it
over<00:03:04.709> and<00:03:05.190> I'll<00:03:05.670> do<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:06.359> same<00:03:06.510> cut<00:03:06.780> this<00:03:07.170> way

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
over and I'll do the same cut this way

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.229 
over and I'll do the same cut this way
my<00:03:07.829> groove<00:03:08.040> will<00:03:08.160> be<00:03:08.280> exactly<00:03:08.549> dead<00:03:08.910> on<00:03:09.060> center

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
my groove will be exactly dead on center

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.870 
my groove will be exactly dead on center
so<00:03:10.139> I'm<00:03:10.440> gonna<00:03:10.560> go<00:03:10.650> through<00:03:10.680> our<00:03:10.950> table<00:03:11.340> and

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
so I'm gonna go through our table and

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.530 
so I'm gonna go through our table and
let's<00:03:12.030> do<00:03:12.150> this<00:03:13.160> so<00:03:14.160> I<00:03:14.190> got<00:03:14.459> my<00:03:14.609> router<00:03:14.970> bit

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
let's do this so I got my router bit

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.229 
let's do this so I got my router bit
right<00:03:16.530> there<00:03:16.560> right<00:03:17.099> at<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.310> top<00:03:17.489> line<00:03:17.790> so<00:03:18.180> I'm

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
right there right at the top line so I'm

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.860 
right there right at the top line so I'm
going<00:03:18.389> to<00:03:18.450> cut<00:03:18.540> that<00:03:18.660> one<00:03:18.810> first

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
going to cut that one first

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.559 
going to cut that one first
lock<00:03:21.870> it<00:03:22.049> in

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:34.309 

I'll<00:03:25.439> bring<00:03:25.620> my<00:03:25.680> fence<00:03:26.040> across<00:03:26.159> I<00:03:32.689> have<00:03:33.689> a<00:03:33.719> few

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
I'll bring my fence across I have a few

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.559 
I'll bring my fence across I have a few
marks<00:03:35.189> right<00:03:35.400> here<00:03:35.579> that<00:03:35.879> tells<00:03:36.090> me<00:03:36.239> when<00:03:36.450> I'm

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569

going to route the top and I'm on route

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:08.420 
going to route the top and I'm on route
the<00:05:02.080> bottom<00:05:02.380> leaving<00:05:03.780> 0.357<00:05:04.780> behind<00:05:05.730> so

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
the bottom leaving 0.357 behind so

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.320 
the bottom leaving 0.357 behind so
that's<00:05:09.430> just<00:05:09.580> a<00:05:09.700> little<00:05:09.730> bit<00:05:10.030> bigger<00:05:10.180> than

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.159 

can<00:05:20.240> mum<00:05:20.660> my<00:05:20.840> mark<00:05:22.360> that's<00:05:23.360> gonna<00:05:23.569> be<00:05:23.690> my<00:05:23.840> tenon

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
can mum my mark that's gonna be my tenon

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:27.219 
can mum my mark that's gonna be my tenon
so<00:05:25.009> what<00:05:25.160> I'm<00:05:25.280> going<00:05:25.430> to<00:05:25.460> do<00:05:25.610> now<00:05:25.819> is<00:05:26.240> I'm<00:05:27.080> going

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:27.229 
so what I'm going to do now is I'm going

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:30.100 
so what I'm going to do now is I'm going
to<00:05:27.289> route<00:05:27.710> leaving<00:05:28.520> that<00:05:28.669> mark<00:05:28.970> behind<00:05:29.120> it's

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
to route leaving that mark behind it's

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.960 
to route leaving that mark behind it's
going<00:05:30.259> to<00:05:30.319> be<00:05:30.380> thicker<00:05:30.620> than<00:05:30.979> what<00:05:31.639> I<00:05:31.669> need

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:31.970 
going to be thicker than what I need

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.600 
going to be thicker than what I need
this<00:05:32.960> way<00:05:33.139> I<00:05:33.169> can<00:05:33.349> take<00:05:33.500> a<00:05:33.560> caliper<00:05:33.919> measure<00:05:34.400> it

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
this way I can take a caliper measure it

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.040 
this way I can take a caliper measure it
and<00:05:34.759> see<00:05:34.910> how<00:05:35.000> much<00:05:35.030> I'm<00:05:35.330> off<00:05:35.479> and<00:05:35.690> then<00:05:35.810> I<00:05:35.900> can

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
and see how much I'm off and then I can

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.770 
and see how much I'm off and then I can
just<00:05:36.259> dial<00:05:36.440> it<00:05:36.620> in<00:05:36.740> using<00:05:37.669> my<00:05:37.849> micro

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
just dial it in using my micro

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.229 
just dial it in using my micro
adjustment
