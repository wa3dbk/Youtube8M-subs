00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:04.600
 hello everybody here or in the next three years we have done how to create a seal 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:04.940
 green 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.339
 ceased functions many people are asking 

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:12.169
 how to create an unprecedented service and that you think that the best pilot in 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:14.189
 two of the three exams 

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:15.889
 personal first thing 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.130
 the ox already for you one thing I lost very light of the bear to know that it is a 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.039
 show confessions 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.570
 according to sarney the older fi-fgts can pay close attention 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.429
 you will understand 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:29.479
 so pay attention to this 

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:31.990
 lows with music rather than that 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.990
 so the first thing that spreads 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.360
 did you yesterday here? 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.360
 She's the one that'll get the 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.570
 it is the personnel and that the treatment is made in the 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.690
 copy of the subject's receipt 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.150
 then you will have to get copy equally 12 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.950
 pib is obscene on a date 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.260
 first thing that is a patetice observes to start 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.540
 there has to be the exchange goes out only on the way and puts this is a tradition 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.290
 It has to be another of peniche's plans to produce 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.520
 3 2 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.870
 Let her milk settings so you pick 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.150
 I think there is a way to escape. 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.820
 maria breia 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.150
 opening it you copy everything 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.520
 in a line with final increase in a slaughter 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.160
 So you're the only property 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.560
 especially to sound spaces I do not know if you are seeing very well 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.150
 more 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.640
 soon to be all right 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.180
 I saw a space in the tartan photo 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.760
 with elano 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.250
 if the saints will not be easy 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.250
 they can see that it will even go to fair fault 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.550
 will be presented to the competition 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.390

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.670
 that's what they also call me their team 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.479
 because you that other had no way to change so soon understand 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.640
 What are your team virtues? 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.950
 It's going to take a little bit longer. 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:06.819
 more personal 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:11.069
 I know it's just talking inside her to 12 that's what you change with 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.739
 the drilling will drop the service 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.549
 is the one on the right 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:18.549
 then be selected 

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:25.309
 with the price here is sixth title 

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:28.869
 12 '- the port with three points 

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:33.449
 the people 

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:37.069
 is the only one but closed the change are nbc that he already has 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.299
 the mayor accepted our proposal 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.299
 the insecurity in the face will be like this 

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:44.279
 our days 

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:47.329
 strike that was already there you find brain folder 

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:51.029
 no no duck wanted a notepad 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.299
 I do not know if he thinks that people 

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:58.499
 so here 

00:02:58.499 --> 00:03:01.499
 I should have had your cell phone. 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.169
 And then he wants to be friends. 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:10.149
 no one will play all the settings are calmer and less 

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:12.009
 internet or drilling 

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:13.659
 if you exchange 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:16.349
 they realize there 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:17.959
 I felt so changed 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.919
 the rich would have only this, but I have already said in some lines that only 

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:24.919
 from here great 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:27.729
 you go there are you 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:31.279
 and now you think past you found a nightclub in the back of it here 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:35.249
 I think they are 

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:38.249
 amorim hair reiterates that the effects of passage 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.019
 the schools 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.019
 technology reduces champagnat years 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:48.269
 in this current 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.009
 or would be father and will be closed without law 

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:53.989
 you can open a process in progress 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:55.809
 for victor 

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:59.209
 Then guys, the angel guy I finish already 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.839
 I have a lot of this that has many patronize in the context of inclusion 

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:04.989
 I'm not sure about that 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.029
 is how did your bush there is nothing if you talk riverside 

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:12.089
 then the exit strategy of the ready 

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:14.450
 After you did it, just beer. 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.209
 it's on 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.959
 and for you, he retorts, he lamented his server that you want 

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:24.029
 if it is to close the sector 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.340
 six defeats 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.590
 the set board 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:30.719
 it was not easy 

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:33.719
 a fmb and put it this 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:38.069
 still if fact not if the server 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.999
 but a personal thing 

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:45.429
 you see it clean there that is the reservation that you got right with asking if 

00:04:45.429 --> 00:04:46.610
 get sick without winning 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.110
 Maria talks to you, tightens. 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.110

 Are you going to do it at home but will it be this way until the end of the month? 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.339
 but already a leader 

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:18.879
 to score 

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:23.459
 real-time many of them there have been hit with request know how to do 

00:05:23.459 --> 00:05:24.690
