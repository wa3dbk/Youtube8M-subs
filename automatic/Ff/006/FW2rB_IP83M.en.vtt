00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.340
 the hunter is the kind of guy who 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:16.930
 love getting fucked 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.550

 four stars was eaten tanks 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.509
 avoid multiple military to fly 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.800
 a fighter jet coming to town or 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:28.510

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.130
 hunting and who has so many buildings 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:32.290
 etc. 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.059
 it's super hard to target others by 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.680
 against when she gets to make a kill 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:37.360

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.030
 pleasure 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.140

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:46.149
 and ends in the buildings 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:48.160
 I say that I say nothing the mercenary 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:48.789

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.590
 inferiority 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:52.600
 he comes in part and he wants to make a 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.980
 maximum of thil he just wants to show 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.719
 that he is the boss or the breaker 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.100
