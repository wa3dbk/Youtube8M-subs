00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
can join together to make the equivalent

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.410 
can join together to make the equivalent
of<00:01:32.939> about<00:01:33.180> fifteen<00:01:33.840> trees<00:01:34.200> in<00:01:34.439> one<00:01:34.619> area<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.420> I

if<00:04:07.500> you<00:04:07.620> have<00:04:07.769> any<00:04:07.919> idea<00:04:08.220> oh<00:04:08.660> okay<00:04:09.660> well<00:04:09.930> I

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
if you have any idea oh okay well I

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.659 
if you have any idea oh okay well I
guess<00:04:10.290> this<00:04:10.470> is<00:04:10.620> spot<00:04:10.859> this<00:04:11.040> is<00:04:11.250> basically

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:11.669 
guess this is spot this is basically

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:13.699 
guess this is spot this is basically
what<00:04:11.879> happened<00:04:12.299> but<00:04:12.989> it<00:04:13.109> went<00:04:13.319> all<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.680> way

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
what happened but it went all the way

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.710 
what happened but it went all the way
across<00:04:13.919> all<00:04:14.370> these<00:04:14.519> mountains<00:04:14.940> over<00:04:15.209> here<00:04:15.419> so

across all these mountains over here so

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.270 
across all these mountains over here so
