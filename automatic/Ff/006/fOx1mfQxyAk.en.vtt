00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
maybe 20 minutes and this is the thing

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.440 
maybe 20 minutes and this is the thing
about<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.370> tea<00:02:17.550> rinses<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.239> coffee

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
about the tea rinses and the coffee

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.240 
about the tea rinses and the coffee
rinses<00:02:18.870> it's<00:02:19.080> very<00:02:19.349> important<00:02:19.769> that<00:02:19.920> you<00:02:20.069> do

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
rinses it's very important that you do

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.339 
rinses it's very important that you do
it<00:02:20.430> in<00:02:20.610> between<00:02:20.760> your<00:02:20.940> conditioning<00:02:21.630> and<00:02:21.690> this

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
it in between your conditioning and this

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.360 
it in between your conditioning and this
is<00:02:22.500> because<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:23.519> the<00:02:24.480> tea<00:02:25.190> actually<00:02:26.190> makes

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
is because the the tea actually makes

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.400 
is because the the tea actually makes
your<00:02:26.489> hair<00:02:26.730> feel<00:02:27.060> like<00:02:27.300> you<00:02:27.569> maybe<00:02:27.870> have<00:02:28.200> it

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
your hair feel like you maybe have it

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.380 
your hair feel like you maybe have it
strengthens<00:02:29.010> it<00:02:29.190> so<00:02:29.430> it<00:02:29.819> feels<00:02:29.940> like<00:02:30.060> you<00:02:30.239> did

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
strengthens it so it feels like you did

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.360 
strengthens it so it feels like you did
a<00:02:30.420> protein<00:02:30.900> or<00:02:30.930> something<00:02:31.080> in<00:02:31.530> it<00:02:31.560> so<00:02:32.310> you

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
a protein or something in it so you

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.650 
a protein or something in it so you
don't<00:02:32.580> want<00:02:32.730> it<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:32.880> dry<00:02:33.030> your<00:02:33.239> hair<00:02:33.480> out<00:02:33.630> so
