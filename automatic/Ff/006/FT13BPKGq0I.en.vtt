00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.570
 [music] 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:15.049
 hello you schools caps with 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:19.550
 master and today I will try to play 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:20.990
 5-minute brocade with analysis will tell you 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.180
 options that I expected for 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.980
 party and what ideas in those one them 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.980
 Positions Well, let's go 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.220
 we decided to play the khan 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.220
 there 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.260
 he would have 5 basic care up 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.260
 and dial d4 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.840
 that's all for now theory 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:54.330
 [music] 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.280
 he is here here is the sun 4 unexpected move 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:01:01.680
 usually beats on d7 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.680
 Here I do not think that the sun 4 coup 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.119
 because in this position 1 to 4 is 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:15.909
 not very good here would have stood better 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:18.009
 grooms then we have as one of them not 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:18.420
 will coins again exchange this moose 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:21.639
 an elephant 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.639
 [music] 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.249
 but white 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.249
 category this us 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.680
 he 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.450
 most likely there will be three zeros and will 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.290
 try to attack the kingside 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.920
 that's what happens to us 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.590
 Black has a game associated with and 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.890
 on the queenside 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.890
 move again 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.730
 [music] 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.640
 White decided to play more specific 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.640
 center 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.630
 but I think there will be a strong move 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:14.520
 walking autumn 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:16.290
 most likely I will go the matter is that 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.260
 this position should not be black 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:23.160
 any problems any endgame will be in 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:27.660
 Black’s favor here because it’s easier for them 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:32.300
 advance your pawns 4 by 3 here than 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.300
 white one on the queenside 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.980
 note 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.980
 time we have a comfortable and advantage 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.740
 about the time, too, do not forget 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:54.230
 if they give us a castling done 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.230
 we definitely have no problems 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.680
 he is white thinking 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.330
 then good advice is worth it because 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.670
 so it is impossible to organize 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.670
 and the position is quite simple 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.370
 will mainly make castling party 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:27.790
 pier c7 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.790
 character he white decided to play like that 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.680
 and 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.760
 for minutes here are different options 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.170
 baby can come up 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:54.490
 let's start out sponsor 6 you can 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.770
 King their center try to leave but 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.900
 still not refused tobacco is not very 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.860
 comfortable after rooks one cartoons sheikh 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.860
 play md5 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.860
 here 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.060
 but 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.639
 let's make a window just in case 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:39.720
 any time you can make a castling in 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.720
 we will always have time 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:04.690
 would be a good oxfords 7 principle if 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.690
 would not sport for 5 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:08.139
 out that 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:12.639
 and now 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:13.569
 they move a pawn and we were given an object of attack 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:16.270
 pawn sopr 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:20.490
 that is, it will be white and very 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:24.349
 problematic to protect after a4 a3 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.349
 mod can and be 4 to play 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.230
 for an hour to four will be a3 therefore 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:37.000
 so let's look for but clones 6 for 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:41.160
 Black has a lot to start here 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.160
 hodovka am strengthen their position 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:46.340
 here konig 4 is also not very nice 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.340
 light remove 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.460
 mood 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:57.320
 here it was the sound of a pawn 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:06:01.100
 because the horse became attacked the horse 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:08.240
 and the bishop is, that is, the pawn hangs on 3 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:09.920
 we can beat offspring up to 435 but 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.810
 see if we take her 

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.630
 change 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:16.830
 [music] 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:19.300
 let's even play 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:23.309
 so we collect 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:26.849
 we have long initiatives here 

00:06:23.309 --> 00:06:26.849
 comfortable position 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:32.110
 can 

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.110
 here without it 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:42.760
 the horse is excellent salt marsh 5 question in handy 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:45.510
 moment with edge b4 allison to 5 

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.510
 then 4 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:55.070
 the other side here appeared in whites 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:55.070
 gathering game 545 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:01.300
 do more white with a sword 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:04.259
 but white why did windows start to play 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.259
 strange 

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:21.970
 now we want a case of reduced by 

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.940
 line b all attention of some kind 

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:24.920
 now riveted 

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:27.080
 [music] 

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:30.830
 the horse on c5 is very unpleasant for 

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:34.010
 white can she and 4 go to 4 and to b3 

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:37.150
 david if that if white light b3 b4 to 

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:37.150
 we also need here 

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:42.700
 unpleasant enough position top 

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:54.110
 Deal need to try to exchange more 

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:54.110
 then they will have a good time 

00:07:54.310 --> 00:08:07.079
 but here the whites surrendered thank you for your attention 

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:07.079
