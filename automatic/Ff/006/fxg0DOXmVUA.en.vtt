00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.639
 good to everyone I am arctic and we are here 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.769
 in a new video this time for 

00:00:05.639 --> 00:00:10.410
 explain how everything will go of the special 

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:12.090
 thousand subscribers and well what do you 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.460
 let's do not going to have special thousand 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.840
 subscribers I tell you now we are 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.179
 recording with the new micro not what 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.279
 you had seen I still believe is this one here 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:21.150
 this little thing that you have here 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.050
 this 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.369
 this is the micro this is the snow bolt and 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.949
 nothing here looks a little bit more 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.979
 big does not look like here super huge and 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.989
 no it's not so big either a little bit 

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:36.149
 you want is pretty much a tennis ball 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.519
 Well, more or less that you had not seen 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.429
 you had seen it yet you had heard it in 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:43.800
 the video of the recording studio the 

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:46.649
 last video that I uploaded on Friday and nothing 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.350
 Now you see it in this video well 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.670
 we are going to what is not what we have to do 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.579
 I'm waking up from the subject already 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.230
 I'm going and it does not touch that then nothing 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.839
 the theme of the special one thousand subscribers 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.370
 I have a video thought ok I already have the 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:00.690
 idea I have everything I want to do 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.910
 I have 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.040
 already the material or whatever I want 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.780
 do I have it now I only need the 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.940
 time as I have told you many times 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.040
 I do not have much time now and so 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.430
 I would not have time to finish it 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.950
 to have it anymore I could not could not 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.540
 catch and and be already done and upload it 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.310
 because it's too long I have a 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.229
 project in mind quite a lot 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.570
 big is the biggest thing that maybe 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:28.710
 never made the most worked video and 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:31.259
 all we can say is that this 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.789
 video and nothing because it happened to me the other day 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.229
 and I say I'm going to do this for 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:36.149
 especially but when I got to 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.220
 think and think about everything that would have 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:41.729
 what to do and all those things then to 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.190
 final nothing at all does not give me time not 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.319
 I could do it so for now what I 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.429
 we pass, we leave it for the special 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:51.200
 2000 subscribers 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:54.539
 the idea I do not know if telling you the come 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.899
 noticing then nothing the idea would be to do 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:59.880
 a kind of series I do not know if series 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.450
 maybe it 's too much work to do as 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.369
 a series would make at least the first 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.140
 episode is worth an episode first for 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.830
 see how it goes if people like it then 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.320
 maybe 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.530
 every time or every special maybe 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.970
 or so every 500 subs I know any 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.590
 foolishness that I can think of so we could 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.720
 make another episode but for now the 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.200
 idea is clear and it is this that I am going to 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:27.120
 to tell right now the idea is to make 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:29.790
 craft attack vale trust attack that yes yes 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.850
 you have it more or less present is a 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.890
 kind of name change of art 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.290
 attack is a program I do not know if in 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.510
 America is done I think that in 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.450
 South America had done the same 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.920
 program with another with another presenter 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.040
 I do not know what the presenter of 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.900
 there the one from here Spain is called Jordi 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.820
 cross and the truth that this guy told me 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.790
 love that is the way he has 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.340
 explain things and everything as it is 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.190
 moves as a link everything is that I believe 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:02.190
 that does it very very well explains how it 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.260
 does everything and understands the first 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.630
 and if you look at my videos many 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.600
 Sometimes I do things that come from him 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.370
 I was very inspired by Jordi Cruz and nothing 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.830
 and it comes from there so I came up with the 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.820
 idea to do as a small tribute to 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.000
 art Attack 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.740
 and do as in this series so nothing 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.870
 would do so as a small episode 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.460
 of art attack but passed to ain craft 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.800
 with minecraft things constructions of 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:28.260
 minecraft drawings in minecraft and those 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.910
 things like art attack do the 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.860
 handyman making a drawing in the big 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.760
 and that you have to find the object 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.129
 where he puts it and those things that come out in 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.680
 is that I stay in the 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:41.030
 episodes so nothing at the moment is 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.970
 it's the idea I hope you're liking 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.709
 nothing today you will have another video worth this 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.110
 is only the first one is like a 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.610
 informative is now worth a bit later 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.220
 later on in this video you will see that 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.739
 upload the video of the next episode of 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.720
 road to gold so nothing we see in 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.430
 the next episode of the autogol of in 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.500
 a few minutes yes I hope you liked 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.060
 the idea of ​​the special and you will leave 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.890
 your things down here that say 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.459
 always the bloggers not down on the 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.500
 comments 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.500
 so none of this is everything and even the 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.780
 next each god 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:16.010
 I do not know why I always have this hobby 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:18.380
 to do as it is a bit jp this good 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.359
 well, nothing that always comes out is not 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.290
 exactly because but well this has 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.290
 been everything see you
