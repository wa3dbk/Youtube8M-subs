00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 And, folks, it's great that the camera 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.270
 reinaldo gripp brasil and today I will do 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.420
 a somewhat unusual test 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.130
 I would say good I have here the xperia z3 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.250
 As you all know, this is the 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.830
 the toughest of the xperia it comes with 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.590
 a water resistance certification 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.769
 a little bigger or he can pass 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.920
 up to 30 minutes submerged in one meter and 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.199
 means of water and also it comes quite 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.720
 tough he has these four 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.180
 dampers in every corner that 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.079
 fall is to cushion the fall and we do not 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.270
 have that glass break so easy 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.079
 Good, I'm going to take a test today, but only to 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:46.739
 you something a little more a level one 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:52.879
 little and higher of terror because I 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:55.440
 I already put xperia c3 in a test of 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.539
 ice water as you know 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.620
 in the test of the bucket of cold water and today 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.559
 I'll show you 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.140
 with all the pain in my heart how's that 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.659
 this device hangs in case you 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.200
 forget it inside the washing machine 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.540
 crockery 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.890
 What do you think it's good, I'm going to call the 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:17.700
 and I will also activate the 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.950
 led then we'll be able to see how 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.299
 it works let you access the 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.210
 settings 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.420
 Let's see how the device goes. 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.049
 to behave in the water 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.049
 alright let's go 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.210
 here you can see the le is on I 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.189
 I'll put it in the water. 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.090
 I'll put it inside the machine 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.090
 wash mother's dayware 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.450
 is working 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:57.110
 It's good to vote up to 30 minutes to see if 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.110
 it's still working 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:18.360
 Good staff only got past 25 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.900
 30 minutes the device is there 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:30.390
 inside and I'll see if it continues 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:32.900
 Functional preparing the screen is still 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.900
 connected 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:47.560
 he is very wet and of course he stopped 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:52.270
 filming this is a problem now but 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:55.390
 Let's see how much we can 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:59.830
 watching the video shows that the device 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:01.360
 It's working there is a bit slow. 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:05.050
 probably because it is wet and does not 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.540
 can check the otoc 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.990
 We go there where I'm working here. 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.600
 perfectly well already in the water 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:18.940
 practically 30 minutes 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:21.370
 And how can you see the reason I go? 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.990
 put the record i 'll put a video 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.490
 In this video I'm going to put the video 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:28.030
 original was recorded inside the machine 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:30.640
 Do not wash the dishes in this video for us. 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:35.110
 see how did it go how's it like ex 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:37.470
 leader to spend time within the 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.990
 dishwasher 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.790
 This was my video showing xperia 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:46.000
 difference inside the washing machine 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.959
 Dishware does not have it at home, but I can 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.440
 tell you what is working 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.440
