00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:22.980
 hive point on two needles this is a 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:26.910
 imitation of the hive of the bees is 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.160
 a fantasy mesh that becomes very 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.679
 easily you should always have a 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.070
 multiple of 2 for this sample 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.360
 I made 22 points because it always 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:42.239
 needs out of multiples of 2 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:45.210
 they need the two edge points is very 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.830
 simple comes out on both sides then 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.020
 has the advantage that one can 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:53.020
 take much more 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:57.700
 after having assembled the 22 points 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:01:01.090
 once I started making the hive the 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:04.270
 first point we had it without knitting and 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:08.140
 we started doing a loop of 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:10.740
 left to right I pass a point you 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.310
 I leave the following 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:18.960
 the one that I have not and I return it over 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:22.900
 of which if I have you pass it loose 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:26.320
 that is a simple decrease 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:30.780
 that's the whole stitch I continue a 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.780
 lazada step one point 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:39.320
 I shuffle the next and return the previous 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:44.240
 above the point that there was no tissue 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:48.470
 lazada step a point left a point in a 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:51.020
 right point and went over the point 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.530
 that does not knit on the point I made in 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.740
 a right point and a loop between each 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:01.610
 one of the simple decreases always 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.200
 there must be a step loop one point 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.740
 needle is inserted through the middle of the 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.470
 point 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.899
 I leave you a point at a right point 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:14.340
 the nonwoven passed over the tissue 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:16.150
 right I release a loop a step 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.900
 point 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:23.049
 a right point a simple decrease 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.140
 a the severe simple decline that is 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:29.500
 spend one point knit the next in a 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:32.859
 right point return the nonwoven 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.140
 over the tissue and that is a decrease 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:39.010
 simple then I make a loop 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:42.700
 I keep repeating the point I make a 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:45.459
 right point of I come back and went through 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.430
 on top of the non-woven knit and 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:52.219
 I make a loop 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.219
 I pass the point some right 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:59.280
 I pass the nonwoven over the tissue and a 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:03.420
 laced that this is the first the third 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:06.570
 that the odd race always goes 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.069
 exactly the same and we finish with step 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.280
 a point 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:14.519
 I shuffle the next one in a right step on 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:18.120
 nonwoven on the fabric and the point of 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:21.389
 edge at the end I weave that is the first 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.639
 race we go for the reverse of the fabric the 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:27.510
 first point is passed that is the edge 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:31.769
 I make a loop and then two 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:36.299
 points together in a backhand point that's 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:39.450
 all a lasso two stitches together in a 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:42.810
 stitch back a loop from left to 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:47.189
 right two points together at a point 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:50.939
 reverse a lasso two stitches together in a 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:54.569
 point reverse the entire race by the side 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:57.510
 the reverse is just as you have one 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:59.669
 that repeat only the first and the 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.969
 second race from time to time 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:05.879
 they have to count the points so that they do not 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:10.469
 they will have missed a loop and 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:13.680
 the hive stitch will not come out two 

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:18.630
 points together in a backhand 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:20.920
 a tie two stitches together in knit 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.540
 reverse 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:27.260
 a loop 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:30.660
 and we finished the race with two points 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:33.890
 together a loop 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:36.690
 and the box here we finished the stitch 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:39.030
 how they realize they are only two 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.820
 races that have to memorize the 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.920
 law and reverse are all 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.870
 they do the same have to be counting 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.360
 the points so that at some point 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.820
 because they may at some point be 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.270
 I forgot to put a loop and it will be 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.710
 would untie the stitch write 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:58.440
 register in the channel so they can see 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.780
 a lot of videos tell me how 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.500
 they applied is aimed at what and how 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.500
 they thought
