 It is spreading a little 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.010
 The archetypical tool is also one piece per buzzer. 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:14.350
 Doing in five eye me fishing 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:18.000
 The owner is to devise tools 5 bottles without hesitation 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.000
 Look at the clothes 1 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:27.960
 Pocah should be cracked, 300,000 years old, 700,000 won, 600,000 won. 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:29.850
 Dow is also the end of one mind Square If you are a parent smallest whale 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.070
 Hundreds of thousands 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.070
 Increases the big deal lay in the Bill 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:41.079
 Oh, eat it all. 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:45.100
 Oh wing hat fashion tone 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:50.229
 2.1 You can just try to nibble at night. 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:54.609
 I'm the only half of the quiz, so I'm going to leave and go boom 

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:56.289
 It's good. I gotta do it with you. 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:59.559
 People are Sapa 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:02.579
 It should be 2 groups of breath steep fights 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:06.030
 I feel immersed. 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:10.170
 I wrapped it in. 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:15.390
 Now let's look easy, yet everyone who worships any more 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:18.350
 Uh Other articles of seongbak line is when will the weekend 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.960
 It looks like that . 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.280
 Anything below 16, I 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.140
 2 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.140
 He's got a lot 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:35.890
 The few cases that are disguised as illegal taking internal do not forget Bee Lake 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:37.360
 In the case of high-priced link holes, the official illegal 4x is 10 each year 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:44.460
 Mari 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:44.460
 However, the number of phones is 10 times more than 10 times the number of guppy per se. 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:54.610
 Exceptions to the prohibition of boreo 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.610
 It's an overly effective 11g thing. 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:05.850
 The biggest reason why illegal whaling still continues 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.850
 Because there is a high demand for more deals 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:19.720
 The food in the restaurant roll tightly nestled Jangsaengpo 5 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:21.750
 Twenty-four years after whaling was banned , nine deals are sold and consumed 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.750
 U 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.680
 Most restaurants have been selling whale meat for decades 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:39.349
 Taking the prohibition of those restaurants of previously formed bone In finding the whale meat 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.349
 I'm still on foot . 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.650
 People's demand for this year is not disappearing 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.650
 U 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:56.890
 It is not difficult to find merchants selling whale meat at the stalls around Jangseungpo . 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.890
 Can 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:04.530
 When you catch 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:11.310
 It's a weird procedure. It's a bad guy. It's bad weather. 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:17.340
 Let's find 2 French squeeze in weather 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:23.310
 It's been a while since I've been booze lately . 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:25.700
 The prohibition of whaling has reduced the volume of distribution, but the demand itself has not completely disappeared. 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.700
 will be 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:33.310
 The claim to allow whaling is growing even among fishermen 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:41.980
 During the interview caught hanging in the nets the other meat is a pathetic scene in a stone fire 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.980
 I could see. 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:50.930
 It takes care of 1m length . 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:56.230
 If it proves not to be an illegal one , 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.230
 It will be handled by the fishermen who have been captured . 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:03.740
 Juxtaposition is a small, but tooth-developed stone called 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:10.180
 66 that feed on other meat 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:12.210
 Big baleen whales are compared to what is eating plankton and shrimp 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.210
 U 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.720
 Ah lead 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.800
 The fishermen used to disassemble the whales . 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:45.210
 Mostly this net is caught and the whales come a little. 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:48.210
 Much in any way come Oh yes I'm just 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:52.880
 For example, it's little notice ah 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:56.650
 * What 's the street eating mostly? It's luck . It's squid . 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.650
 Ahohji is not going to be a lot, mainly tuna 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:07.100
 Those who are identified in the stomach of the disintegrated whale 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.100
 Squid was small fishy 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:15.800
 So we are rattling how many consumers lack the modified transaction the third floor is perfect 

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:20.090
 That's the supply . 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:24.139
 What about the criminals whose name 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:28.610
 So far I had're all that riff off 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:33.590
 I guess this unfamiliar calendar is a laugh with life conditions in the fishermen's temple. 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:39.979
 If we do this , we will not do it again. 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:42.259
 However, when the fishermen went as they were , 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:45.580
 The four story had unknowingly board 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:45.580
 I bought all the ultimate hair. 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:54.770
 In September, when the fishermen began to feed their white meat, 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.800
 The catch is decreasing. 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.800
 uh 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:09.750
 But the father does not mean the end value r and a little teji 

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:13.050
 It must have been. 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:16.620
 I know that is coming apart 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:19.860
 Or twisted thought tag shape width more 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:23.509
 So work so that 33 to lead 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.509
 It's a great deal . 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:33.130
 6:00 Critical prey on the goal If fishermen lose their whales, 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.130
 We are claiming that we are experiencing the impact 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:49.180
 Did the whales increase the fishermen's vitality in the sea of ​​the Korean peninsula ? 

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:49.180
 I found the scene where the operation is going on. 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:07:04.320
 I met a fishing boat from fishing grounds that are arriving up a couple of times in my 

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:09.450
 The net to catch anchovies and Java was empty. 

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:12.180
 In recent years, the amount of despised fish has decreased by more than half according to fisheries 

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:17.010
 Climate impacts such as rising 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:20.040
 Fishermen are convinced that whale growth is also a reason . 

00:07:17.010 --> 00:07:23.840
 You should not see the encryption sent 

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:23.840
 High-grade cancer vocabulary 4 is high 1
