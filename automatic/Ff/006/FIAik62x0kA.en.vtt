00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:15.110
 for 30 years the masa has been sending satellites into orbit to study the sun 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:21.240
 but never before had there been such extraordinary images from space 

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:27.529
 the first photos are the videos collected by the sol ardena message server tools qst 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.970
 the last space telescope of the mass in order of time 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.699
 I'm launched 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:47.730
 11 February 2010 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.590
 and if god is the most advanced spatial observer but is designed to study 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.350
 our star 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.930
 capable of producing 10 times sharper images or high transmission 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.490
 definition 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:05.300
 who supplies scientific data with a completeness is a speed never 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.300
 reached so far by no space probe 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.909
 black rose dragon returns rather will examine the magnetic field and the 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.270
 photosphere of the sun 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.350
 the target 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.250
 to get a better understanding of the role 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.280
 Pillar carries out dry water for the earth's climate in chemistry 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.260
 and the first images that silvio immediately took their breath away 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.300
 passionate scientists 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.890
 details that had never been noticed p 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.890
 as a material that comes out of sunspots 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.340
 paul enlargement of some areas of the sun during educational activities 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.730
 that in panda 2 - 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.730
 show the material as they are poured 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.310
 violet ds observations will revolutionize dreamy physics 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.190
 in the same way in that atv-2 space telescope 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.290
 revolutionized astrophysics 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.960
 simultaneous monitoring at different associated wavelengths I have a rapid 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.589
 sequence of observations 

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:18.699
 will provide an unprecedented detailed view of the phenomena that occur 

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:21.129
 on the sun 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:25.279
 some of the main tasks will be to look at the exe and le files 

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:28.760
 Solar storms can also affect our planet 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:34.799
 and to try to make us understand what the influence of the field is 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:39.420
 magnetic of our star processes that take place within it 

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:44.679
 in fact, current knowledge suggests that solar magnetic activity 

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:47.799
 it is much more dominant the 4 is not opened
