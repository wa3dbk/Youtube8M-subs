00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.980
 hello everyone with you andrew andreich my 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:09.740
 site all point dot ru 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:14.330
 749 task find the area 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:21.830
 rectangle rectangle area 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:26.000
 if its length is 4 meters 12 centimeters 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:29.160
 width is 4 times less 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.390
 let's do this first 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:39.180
 calculate the length of our rectangle in 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:43.440
 as centimeters 1 4 meters 12 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:47.180
 centimeters translate to centimeter in 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:52.079
 every meter 100 centimeters 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:54.739
 then 4 meters is 400 centimeters and even 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.530
 12 centimeters four hundred twelve 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.219
 centimeters in every meter 100 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.210
 centimeters 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:08.549
 then 4 meters 400 centimeters and 12 more 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.560
 centimeters 42 centimeters our length 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:15.570
 four hundred and twelve rectangles 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:19.860
 centimeters second act let's 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:23.400
 try to calculate the width width of 4 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:27.560
 times less that is if you are the length through 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:31.860
 one hundred and twelve centimeters then this is the length 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:34.650
 then its width is 4 times smaller to 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.310
 find out how much 4 times less is needed 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:42.090
 divide by four let's have a column 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:48.600
 divide 412 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:52.619
 divide by 4 we take one 1 4 4 out of 4 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:56.430
 subtract 4 this is zero we demolish one 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:02:01.399
 the number is less than this therefore we write 0 and 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:04.399
 pines still deuce now take on 33 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.399
 412 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:14.610
 103 it turns out one hundred and three 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:20.640
 centimeter and so now we already know and 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:26.220
 the length and width of our rectangle as 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:29.880
 find the area of ​​the rectangle need length 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.910
 multiply by four hundred and twelve width 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:38.700
 centimeters multiplied by 100 three 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:40.880
 centimeter how much will it be if 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:45.450
 centimeter multiplied by centimeter and will be 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:53.880
 centimeters squared a 412 times 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:03:06.260
 103 now count so 412 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:19.530
 multiply by 100 3 columns 3 by 2 6 3 by 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:28.220
 13 3 to 4 12 0 to 200 to 100 to 40 1 to 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:28.220
 2 2 1 to 1 1 1 to 44 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.739
 add up so i'm akvalita crooked 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:41.640
 started writing here 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:47.730
 six here three three to 2 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:50.040
 this is 41 to 1 this is 1 of 4 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.519
 what if you suddenly start writing from i 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.600
 then here are the lines themselves can 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.739
 secure to not fold will 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.680
 around with one 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:00.480
 or three freight that can not be folded 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.030
 secure yourself with vertical lines 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.950
 so as not to stack from different columns 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:09.209
 but better write carefully 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:11.519
 of course and it happened with sing 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:16.500
 miscalculated one plus 12 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:17.299
 alien written 6 6 here 3 2 to 2 4 1 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.720
 up to 12 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.430
 and here 4 of course two one plus one this 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.520
 two 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:27.650
 who found a mistake before me that well done 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.080
 who noticed in front of me that here 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:34.580
 wrong that fellow and who did not notice 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:38.720
 that is not great because the mistake 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:44.750
 trifling of course and so it turns out 42 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:48.009
 thousand four hundred thirty six forty 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:53.050
 two thousand four hundred thirty six 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:54.710
 centimeters square is the answer to the problem 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.719
 that's all 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.830
 My name is Andrei Andreich My site 

00:04:56.719 --> 00:05:00.289
 all point dot ru 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:05.500
 write in the comments clear solution 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:05.500
 or it is not clear on this all bye
