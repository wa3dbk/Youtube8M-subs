00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:07.249 

I'm<00:00:05.279> going<00:00:05.490> to<00:00:05.549> show<00:00:05.730> you<00:00:05.759> how<00:00:06.210> to<00:00:06.240> use<00:00:06.660> a<00:00:06.899> silk

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
I'm going to show you how to use a silk

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.680 
I'm going to show you how to use a silk
string<00:00:07.620> in<00:00:07.830> the<00:00:08.189> nodding<00:00:08.519> and<00:00:08.940> beading<00:00:09.330> so

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
string in the nodding and beading so

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.450 
string in the nodding and beading so
when<00:00:09.870> we<00:00:10.019> use<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.469> silk<00:00:10.740> string<00:00:10.950> it's<00:00:11.160> usually

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
when we use a silk string it's usually

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.060 
when we use a silk string it's usually
when<00:00:11.759> we<00:00:11.880> use<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.059> better<00:00:12.450> material<00:00:12.799> so<00:00:13.799> now<00:00:13.920> I'm

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
when we use a better material so now I'm

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.670 
when we use a better material so now I'm
going<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.519> attach<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.389> clasp<00:00:15.630> and<00:00:15.990> when<00:00:16.650> I

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
going to attach the clasp and when I

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.290 
going to attach the clasp and when I
attach<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.190> clasp<00:00:17.369> with<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.699> silk<00:00:17.940> string<00:00:18.180> I

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
attach a clasp with the silk string I

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.620 
attach a clasp with the silk string I
use<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:19.250> product<00:00:20.250> called<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.760> French<00:00:21.029> wire<00:00:21.270> and

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
use a product called a French wire and

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.220 
use a product called a French wire and
basically<00:00:22.320> French<00:00:22.830> wire<00:00:23.300> covers<00:00:24.300> your<00:00:24.840> cork

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
basically French wire covers your cork

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.349 
basically French wire covers your cork
and<00:00:25.500> you'll<00:00:26.400> see<00:00:26.550> what<00:00:26.670> I<00:00:26.699> mean<00:00:26.760> by<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.060> when

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
and you'll see what I mean by that when

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.630 
and you'll see what I mean by that when
we<00:00:27.480> when<00:00:27.930> we<00:00:27.960> actually<00:00:28.560> physically<00:00:28.859> do<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.250> but

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
we when we actually physically do it but

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.979 
we when we actually physically do it but
basically<00:00:29.760> French<00:00:30.150> wire<00:00:30.390> are<00:00:30.869> tiny<00:00:31.590> coils<00:00:32.309> of

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
basically French wire are tiny coils of

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.350 
basically French wire are tiny coils of
very<00:00:33.989> very<00:00:34.290> fine<00:00:34.590> wire<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:35.820> don't<00:00:36.030> want<00:00:36.270> to

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
very very fine wire you don't want to

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.950 
very very fine wire you don't want to
handle<00:00:36.540> it

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
handle it

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.530 
handle it
so<00:00:37.170> much<00:00:37.380> because<00:00:38.280> you'll<00:00:38.550> create<00:00:39.000> crimps<00:00:39.480> in

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
so much because you'll create crimps in

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.850 
so much because you'll create crimps in
it<00:00:39.660> like<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:39.960> can<00:00:40.110> see<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.500> know<00:00:40.590> in<00:00:40.680> some<00:00:40.800> of

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
it like you can see you know in some of

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.369 
it like you can see you know in some of
these<00:00:40.950> pieces<00:00:41.129> here<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:42.450> basically<00:00:42.719> I'm<00:00:43.170> going

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
these pieces here so basically I'm going

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.130 
these pieces here so basically I'm going
to<00:00:43.469> use<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.250> Griffin<00:00:44.820> silk<00:00:45.390> B<00:00:45.690> cord<00:00:46.020> that

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
to use the Griffin silk B cord that

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.779 
to use the Griffin silk B cord that
comes<00:00:46.379> with<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.829> needle<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.250> I've<00:00:47.399> decided

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
comes with the needle and I've decided

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.090 
comes with the needle and I've decided
that<00:00:48.000> this<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.719> correct<00:00:48.960> size<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.890> goes

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
that this is the correct size that goes

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.630 
that this is the correct size that goes
into<00:00:50.399> my<00:00:51.149> bead<00:00:51.570> hole<00:00:51.930> does<00:00:52.620> this<00:00:52.980> correct<00:00:53.460> size

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
into my bead hole does this correct size

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.479 
into my bead hole does this correct size
of<00:00:53.879> silk<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.510> size<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.379> indicated<00:00:55.559> here<00:00:55.949> and

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
of silk the size is indicated here and

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.130 
of silk the size is indicated here and
you<00:00:56.579> can<00:00:56.760> sort<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.000> just<00:00:57.180> visually<00:00:57.870> tell

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
you can sort of just visually tell

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.959 
you can sort of just visually tell
they're<00:00:58.590> they're<00:00:58.890> not<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:59.340> much<00:00:59.520> money<00:00:59.730> so<00:00:59.940> I

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
they're they're not that much money so I

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.029 
they're they're not that much money so I
usually<00:01:00.210> buy<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:01.079> two<00:01:01.289> sizes<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.739> I<00:01:01.800> think

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
usually buy the two sizes that I think

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.310 
usually buy the two sizes that I think
is<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.250> closest<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:03.539> comes<00:01:03.809> in<00:01:03.930> silver<00:01:04.140> or

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
is the closest it comes in silver or

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.820 
is the closest it comes in silver or
gold

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
gold

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.090 
gold
and<00:01:05.960> you<00:01:06.960> know<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:07.260> this<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.740> class<00:01:07.920> I'm

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
and you know so this is the class I'm

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.830 
and you know so this is the class I'm
going<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.280> use<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:09.030> normally<00:01:09.360> I<00:01:09.420> would<00:01:09.630> use

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
going to use so normally I would use

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.140 
going to use so normally I would use
gold<00:01:10.409> but<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:10.650> don't<00:01:10.890> have<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.310> right<00:01:11.490> size<00:01:11.700> for

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
gold but I don't have the right size for

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.429 
gold but I don't have the right size for
this<00:01:12.270> thick<00:01:12.659> cord<00:01:12.990> so<00:01:13.200> I'm<00:01:13.290> going<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.500> use<00:01:13.680> this

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
this thick cord so I'm going to use this

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:18.550 
this thick cord so I'm going to use this
silver<00:01:16.439> one<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:16.740> sort<00:01:17.070> blackened<00:01:17.670> already

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
silver one that I sort blackened already

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:25.609 
silver one that I sort blackened already
first<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.770> put<00:01:19.950> on<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.159> crimp<00:01:23.150> okay<00:01:24.320> then<00:01:25.320> we're

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
first I put on the crimp okay then we're

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.469 
first I put on the crimp okay then we're
going<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.860> choose<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:28.340> piece<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.880> French

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
going to choose a piece of the French

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.469 
going to choose a piece of the French
wire<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:30.930> comes<00:01:31.110> in<00:01:31.259> different<00:01:31.310> inner

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
wire and it comes in different inner

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.249 
wire and it comes in different inner
diameter<00:01:34.070> opening<00:01:35.070> width<00:01:35.490> size<00:01:35.759> so<00:01:36.259> because

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
diameter opening width size so because

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.010 
diameter opening width size so because
I'm<00:01:37.380> using<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:38.360> thicker<00:01:41.420> thread<00:01:42.420> I'm<00:01:42.810> going

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
I'm using the thicker thread I'm going

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.840 
I'm using the thicker thread I'm going
to<00:01:43.079> use

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.480 

I<00:01:46.020> don't<00:01:47.020> have<00:01:47.170> gold<00:01:47.439> that<00:01:47.710> fits<00:01:48.009> this<00:01:48.250> so<00:01:48.400> I

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
I don't have gold that fits this so I

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.179 
I don't have gold that fits this so I
have<00:01:48.610> to<00:01:48.729> use<00:01:48.850> a<00:01:48.880> silver<00:01:49.360> one<00:01:49.509> and<00:01:50.070> basically<00:01:51.070> I

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
have to use a silver one and basically I

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:54.960 
have to use a silver one and basically I
put<00:01:51.430> it<00:01:51.580> through<00:01:51.610> the<00:01:51.939> needle<00:01:52.090> and<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:54.729> length

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
put it through the needle and the length

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.030 
put it through the needle and the length
that<00:01:55.150> you<00:01:55.299> cut<00:01:55.540> is<00:01:55.750> sort<00:01:55.990> of<00:01:56.049> depends<00:01:56.650> on<00:01:56.770> you

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 
that you cut is sort of depends on you

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.620 
that you cut is sort of depends on you
know<00:01:57.130> your<00:01:57.310> design<00:01:57.610> if<00:01:57.759> you'd<00:01:57.909> like<00:01:58.119> it<00:01:58.299> you

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
know your design if you'd like it you

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.830 
know your design if you'd like it you
know<00:01:58.720> common<00:01:59.320> it<00:01:59.409> or<00:01:59.560> not<00:01:59.680> prominent<00:02:00.190> and

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
know common it or not prominent and

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.530 
know common it or not prominent and
you're<00:02:01.840> just<00:02:01.960> going<00:02:02.110> to<00:02:02.140> slide<00:02:02.409> it<00:02:02.440> on<00:02:03.420> so<00:02:04.420> then

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
you're just going to slide it on so then

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.660 
and see that you get that crease in the
middle<00:03:08.210> then<00:03:09.020> I<00:03:09.170> use<00:03:09.350> the<00:03:09.530> other<00:03:09.710> end<00:03:11.590> and

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
middle then I use the other end and

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.890 
middle then I use the other end and
that's<00:03:13.670> it<00:03:13.940> and<00:03:14.030> that's<00:03:14.090> how<00:03:14.210> we<00:03:14.300> use<00:03:14.600> French

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900
