00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 in today's video I'll explain to 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:08.189
 you on three pillars of photography 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.130
 these are basic elements that without them 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.200
 there would be no way to hit a photo 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.969
 so the time you learn that 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.070
 principles are these 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.100
 And how will you use them? 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.920
 gain full control over result 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.590
 end of your image and thus have more 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.400
 confidence to take photo in manual mode 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:32.850
 the three pillars and photographs the opening 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.239
 the shutter speed and 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.399
 iso considers the aperture of the diaphragm 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.219
 as being a window 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.070
 How big of this window is it all? 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.579
 depends on which lens you are using 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.960
 although the opening of the diaphragm is 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:52.680
 directly related to the capacity of the 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.530
 your lens it is controlled by the camera 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.079
 as well as a window the greater the 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.390
 aperture plus light 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.589
 She will let you into the house. 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.689
 smaller - in what it means 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.299
 as it affects the image if the 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.820
 opening is great it will allow 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:16.259
 too much light between and the bottom 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:19.259
 this small aperture 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.049
 allow the fund to all all 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.090
 image planes are clear 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.250
 if you are the background blurred enough 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.350
 put the fk tokyo and that is an indicative 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:33.390
 aperture of the diaphragm is the 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:36.689
 As low as 1.8 1.4 and if you want a 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.880
 crisp background and the whole photo in focus 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.299
 You will want to increase the iof stop to 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.250
 f 18 and 22 and so on 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.460
 The second pillar of photography is the 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.280
 shutter speed if the aperture of the 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:54.180
 diaphragm is the size of your window 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.850
 the shutter speed or tea is the 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.680
 curtain that opens and closes and the time 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.009
 determined that it will be open 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.320
 It is you who determines this time in the 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.520
 camera settings in fractions 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.200
 second 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:14.430
 then the greater the infraction, or 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.590
 one over ten or even one second 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.560
 two seconds 30 seconds 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.510
 these larger pressures will 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.090
 allow you to capture the impression of 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.780
 the picture will be blurred and the 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:31.590
 a lesser pressure as a lord of 61 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:34.290
 about 850 passwords this will allow with 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.540
 you freeze the movement and the photo comes out 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.400
 completely the subject of the force is 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.760
 completely static 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:44.220
 the third pillar of the photography is the iso 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:48.239
 laughter it changes the sensitivity of the 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.549
 sensor and the higher the 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:54.120
 sensitivity and quality goes 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:56.040
 allow you to enter to photo quality 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.470
 this one that sometimes you will not see that 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.420
 is then available at these times 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.650
 When it 's too dark, you 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.349
 increases iso 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.970
 the ideal is not to abuse laughter or 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:11.489
 be use less possible value of judgment and 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:14.220
 only use the floor value and your 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.079
 sensitivity when it is really 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.940
 I need you if you want to learn more. 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.950
 about it click here in this video to 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.950
 you learn in which situations you 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.410
 not only can but how to increase iso 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.750
 now that you know what the three 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.579
 pillars of photography, how can 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.859
 apply this in real life 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:34.170
 When you hit a photo, you go. 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:37.829
 control the three pillars on your camera 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:40.139
 in manual mode and in those hours you go 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:42.450
 to compensate one thing for the other 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:44.310
 The more you allow yourself to play explore 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.980
 these three principles, these three 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.920
 elements and pillars of a 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:53.609
 You will have more confidence in photography. 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:57.030
 to use the manual mode 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:58.739
 change your settings so that you 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.810
 achieve the result you are 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.639
 imagining in your head when you 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.510
 You're tapping the photo that's deep and 

00:04:02.639 --> 00:04:06.060
 suffocated 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.669
 is the aperture of the diaphragm want to freeze 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.169
 the shutter speed movement is 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:12.480
 very dark and has no quality 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:15.690
 enough there I am and it's these hours 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.739
 of desperation to get that picture 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.389
 What did you think was worth it? 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.520
 you have knowledge of these three 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:24.650
 I hope you have enjoyed the 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.789
 video of a enjoy and share with 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:30.490
 Who do you think will learn a language? 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:30.490
 New thing and see you next week.
