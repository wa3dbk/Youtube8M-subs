00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
inside the space and garage itself now

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.770 
inside the space and garage itself now
nobody's<00:01:38.549> ever<00:01:38.700> been<00:01:38.759> inside<00:01:39.090> this<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:39.630> it's

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
nobody's ever been inside this so it's

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.810 
nobody's ever been inside this so it's
pretty<00:01:40.140> cool<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.710> it's<00:01:41.070> pretty<00:01:41.310> weird<00:01:41.579> as

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
pretty cool and it's pretty weird as

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.310 
pretty cool and it's pretty weird as
well<00:01:42.000> there's<00:01:42.450> probably<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.930> lot<00:01:43.200> of

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
well there's probably a lot of

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.830 
well there's probably a lot of
underlying<00:01:43.710> meaning<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.549> this<00:01:44.640> place<00:01:44.909> but<00:01:45.630> I

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840

there's<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.579> lot<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:50.850> electrical<00:01:51.299> items<00:01:51.570> which

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
there's a lot of electrical items which

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.530 
there's a lot of electrical items which
are<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.320> do<00:01:52.530> with<00:01:52.710> space<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:54.149> deal<00:01:54.299> with

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
are to do with space and to deal with

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
creating electric stuff but this box

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.120 
creating electric stuff but this box
here<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:01.290> looks<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.770> be<00:02:01.920> um<00:02:02.329> a<00:02:03.409> box<00:02:04.409> really<00:02:04.950> and

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
here it looks to be um a box really and

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.330 
here it looks to be um a box really and
there's<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:05.880> couple<00:02:06.030> of<00:02:06.149> boxes<00:02:06.329> around<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.200> a

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
there's a couple of boxes around and a

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.790 
there's a couple of boxes around and a
couple<00:02:08.340> of<00:02:08.399> things<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:09.420> basically<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.200> main

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
couple of things the basically the main

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.650 
couple of things the basically the main
thing<00:02:11.099> is<00:02:11.129> that<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.610> lights<00:02:11.910> you<00:02:12.209> can<00:02:12.239> kind<00:02:12.599> of

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
thing is that the lights you can kind of

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.870 
thing is that the lights you can kind of
see

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
see

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.910 
see
a<00:02:12.910> spacey<00:02:13.570> kind<00:02:13.930> of<00:02:14.020> color<00:02:14.200> which<00:02:14.740> also

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
a spacey kind of color which also

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.320 
a spacey kind of color which also
matches<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.460> color<00:02:15.580> of<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.850> space<00:02:16.090> car

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
matches the color of the space car

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.880 
matches the color of the space car
itself<00:02:16.630> and<00:02:16.960> then<00:02:17.470> there's<00:02:17.680> other<00:02:17.800> things

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
itself and then there's other things

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.330 
itself and then there's other things
like<00:02:18.310> gasoline<00:02:18.580> cans<00:02:19.210> and<00:02:19.650> bits<00:02:20.650> of<00:02:20.830> wood<00:02:21.070> line

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
like gasoline cans and bits of wood line

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.130

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
pretty weird to have in here just

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.590 
pretty weird to have in here just
randomly<00:02:42.640> but<00:02:42.850> it<00:02:42.940> could<00:02:43.090> be<00:02:43.210> to<00:02:43.360> do<00:02:43.450> with

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
randomly but it could be to do with

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.810 
randomly but it could be to do with
clean<00:02:43.840> hands<00:02:44.200> from<00:02:44.380> chemicals<00:02:44.920> could<00:02:45.640> be<00:02:45.790> a

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
clean hands from chemicals could be a

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.450 
clean hands from chemicals could be a
very<00:02:46.120> dangerous<00:02:46.330> places<00:02:46.840> and<00:02:47.260> then<00:02:48.070> I<00:02:48.100> try<00:02:48.280> to

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
very dangerous places and then I try to

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.190 
very dangerous places and then I try to
open<00:02:48.700> the<00:02:48.880> fence<00:02:49.240> from<00:02:49.540> the<00:02:49.660> inside<00:02:49.960> but<00:02:50.140> it

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
open the fence from the inside but it

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.420 
open the fence from the inside but it
didn't<00:02:50.410> actually<00:02:50.530> work<00:02:50.890> but<00:02:51.160> I<00:02:51.190> didn't<00:02:51.370> have

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
didn't actually work but I didn't have
