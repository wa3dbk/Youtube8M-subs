00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
mid game oriented they have this set up

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.590 
mid game oriented they have this set up
where<00:00:11.520> they<00:00:11.639> could<00:00:11.760> use<00:00:11.880> that<00:00:12.030> Chronos<00:00:12.389> sphere

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:12.600 
where they could use that Chronos sphere

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.720 
where they could use that Chronos sphere
and<00:00:12.800> if<00:00:13.800> they<00:00:13.890> end<00:00:14.010> up<00:00:14.070> with<00:00:14.160> an<00:00:14.220> X<00:00:14.370> Orton<00:00:14.580> for<00:00:14.700> a

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
and if they end up with an X Orton for a

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.160 
and if they end up with an X Orton for a
lot<00:00:14.820> of<00:00:14.940> global<00:00:15.210> presence<00:00:15.390> and<00:00:15.750> probably<00:00:15.990> pick

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
lot of global presence and probably pick

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.260 
lot of global presence and probably pick
up<00:00:16.260> some<00:00:16.380> kills<00:00:16.590> early<00:00:16.890> on<00:00:17.010> so<00:00:17.400> yeah<00:00:18.000> I<00:00:18.180> think

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
up some kills early on so yeah I think

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.089 
up some kills early on so yeah I think
the<00:00:18.510> exhorts<00:00:18.840> probably<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.140> better<00:00:19.260> pic<00:00:19.980> here

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:20.099 
the exhorts probably the better pic here

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:21.529 
the exhorts probably the better pic here
