00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
little bit of a mouthful to pronounce so

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.910 
little bit of a mouthful to pronounce so
you<00:00:57.210> can<00:00:57.360> also<00:00:57.510> call<00:00:58.109> him<00:00:58.289> by<00:00:58.469> his<00:00:58.649> nickname

pronounced<00:01:07.619> s<00:01:07.740> height<00:01:08.390> though<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:09.900> don't<00:01:10.590> speak

going too crazy with the bunnies and
