 available in the world about twenty years ago 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.600

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.880
 I must say here the adjustment is long and 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.620
 it is difficult here and on the other hand you 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.730
 it can you can wear them in your hand 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.980

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.800
 pixels

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.189
 discovered deputy time presence on 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.990
 stand 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.390
 sometimes the display lights up the most 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.950
 likely this happens when you are you 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.479
 raise your watch to look about him 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.750

 despector samsungu and let's 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.430
 Here the interface with the wipe to the left works 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:30.600
 right you can fall between 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.759
 various functions and applications 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.399
 which is here let's put on a loan 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.509
 of vyse memes voice notes 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.640
 notifications which syncs with 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.399

 oris give it to judges 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.780
 it seems to me to process it until now by 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.060
 what is it possible here wolf or not can 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.920
 not to be wifi but he is looking for something 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.409
 looking for it connected to this smartphone 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.060
 so if the smartphone from the internet is here 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.850
 also need to be internet too 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.920
 but what is not and show it 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.690

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.930
 played in Berlin oh e 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.440
 Okay, see this one that I showed you 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.330
 what 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.880
 back gesture is done with swipe 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.010
 top of the screen of the candle gallery app 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.260
 media controller in the form can be controlled 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.760
 music from your smartphone so this 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.540
 strange words pinometer is a pedometer 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.180
 in Russian 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.739
 settings and other applications of others 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.319
 By the way, there are a lot of different chips. 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.060
 there is also a side about and for example 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.580
 banjo is my favorite which shows 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.620
 what friends are nearby 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.580
 chaton contacts 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.170
 gallery of honor grope is in general 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.360
 quite a lot of third-party applications 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.040
 which are already known here by navigator 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.769
 the blame 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.530
 vivian he will show it again so swipe 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.030
 top by we we went back one more 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.799
 cool thing that is there about 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.280
 you don't know yet, but I know ha ha 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:02.900
 here is this camera camera on 1 and 9 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:08.350
 megapixels now i'll even do 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:10.270
 snapshot and show you not weak 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.980
 and this is the camera interface itself 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.850
 In order to make a photo you just need 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.850
 tap the screen 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.910
 sleep happens a couple of seconds before 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.120
 take a picture can add voice 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.750
 note 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.330
 can go into the options all and let's look 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.880
 quality is natural in the gallery 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:30.310
 unassumingly with a sensor 19 megapixels 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.350
 here is loaded and china cool pictures well 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.500
 now and then de cet and filmed and where is the 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.750
 valerik which autopilot valera is 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.770
 here it can be possible to shove somehow 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.990
 you can understand him 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:47.320
 that's all there is in place well now 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.130
 let's move on to another interesting forgot 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.740
 one more important thing 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.240
 if someone calls you for example yes you 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.250
 instead to get the phone out 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.020
 pockets you can do here so 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.490
 so here samsung 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.140
 and provoke us to new gestures 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.570
 by golly but because here here 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.400
 hidden speaker and microphone and using 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.230
 these hours you can talk 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.210
 life is now on him to check 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.650
 sound quality and call quality i think 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.360
 be sure to do it soon 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.800
 but if you see people walking 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.770
 through the streets here and so in a couple of months 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.600
 then in general, don't be surprised this is people with 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.299
 galaxy gear ok 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.980
 Well, in the end let's talk about that 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.520
 the thing which is 1 point the site rushes in 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:27.370
 eyes this design design guys what am i 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.020
 I can say in my opinion that one 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:33.280
 decision which year samsung company 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:35.290
 but still strange, well, I have this watch 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.150
 honestly remind these bracelets 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.200
 who are dressed in prison 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.009
 lest they run away 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.740
 or 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:43.689
 know those who are subscribed to 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.490
 I will donâ€™t leave the place 

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:46.809
 The man from the city is strange 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.300
 big bulky metal object 

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:51.789
 pay attention not very thick and they 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.849
 colored heavy they are very even 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:56.529
 weighty such a battery here is not 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:58.659
 Specified on how we change the first 

00:04:56.529 --> 00:05:01.599
 hours on the presentation to say what is missing 

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:02.979
 for 25 hours of work here at the presentation 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:04.960
 they say that he is 25 hours of work then 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:05.619
 Reale, as if this will be one day 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.990
 with a stretch 

00:05:05.619 --> 00:05:09.159
 which of course is sad i mean those need 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.240
 besides charging the tablet 

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:12.249
 smartphone 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.169
 what will come to charge at home and watch it 

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:16.210
 strange at that size is huge and 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:18.430
 how could the principle be shoved here 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.259
 large enough batteries well out 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.029
 good design plan must say 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:25.089
 what will be many color options 

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:26.680
 here we have 6 pieces on our stand 

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:28.629
 but in my opinion there will be more and more 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.240
 blue and a few options that is 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:33.189
 principle, you can choose if you 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.629
 this thing they liked about the price by the way 

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:37.959
 said nothing percentage nothing 

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:39.520
 said but said that September 25 is 

00:05:37.959 --> 00:05:42.099
