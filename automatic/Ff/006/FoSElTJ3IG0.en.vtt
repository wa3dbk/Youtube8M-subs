00:01:01.919 --> 00:01:01.929 
into this so first up on the team we

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:04.049 
into this so first up on the team we
have<00:01:01.960> prime<00:01:02.949> doomsday<00:01:03.429> which<00:01:03.579> can<00:01:03.760> be<00:01:03.850> bought

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:05.650 
in the store for two hundred one

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.149 
in the store for two hundred one
thousand<00:01:06.070> i<00:01:06.130> think<00:01:06.340> and<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:08.049> his<00:01:08.680> passive<00:01:09.070> is

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
thousand i think and so his passive is

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:11.610 
thousand i think and so his passive is
called<00:01:09.340> hero<00:01:09.610> killer<00:01:09.909> so<00:01:10.870> for<00:01:11.080> each<00:01:11.110> knockout

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.620 
called hero killer so for each knockout

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.800 
called hero killer so for each knockout
blow<00:01:11.830> that<00:01:12.010> doomsday<00:01:12.370> deals<00:01:12.790> he<00:01:13.000> gains<00:01:13.300> fifty

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
blow that doomsday deals he gains fifty

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.520 
blow that doomsday deals he gains fifty
percent<00:01:14.110> health<00:01:14.440> so<00:01:15.400> that's<00:01:15.700> cool<00:01:16.060> sir<00:01:16.530> so

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
percent health so that's cool sir so

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.770 
percent health so that's cool sir so
obviously<00:01:17.830> when<00:01:18.010> he<00:01:18.100> knock<00:01:18.250> someone<00:01:18.610> out<00:01:18.780> he

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
obviously when he knock someone out he

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.600 
obviously when he knock someone out he
gains<00:01:20.050> fifty<00:01:20.590> percent<00:01:20.890> health<00:01:22.230> ok<00:01:23.230> so<00:01:23.290> i<00:01:23.890> think

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
gains fifty percent health ok so i think

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.580 
gains fifty percent health ok so i think
it's<00:01:24.730> fifty<00:01:25.240> percent<00:01:25.510> of<00:01:25.720> his<00:01:25.930> current<00:01:26.290> health

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590

i'm not too sure Benny way sticking up
we<00:01:28.900> have<00:01:29.110> containment<00:01:29.740> doomsday<00:01:30.400> so<00:01:30.460> think

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
we have containment doomsday so think

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.360 
we have containment doomsday so think
you<00:01:31.420> can<00:01:31.660> get<00:01:31.840> him<00:01:32.080> in<00:01:32.290> the<00:01:32.650> challenge<00:01:33.190> birth

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.370 
you can get him in the challenge birth

increase<00:01:51.690> so<00:01:52.690> that<00:01:52.870> is<00:01:53.020> crazy<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:56.590> yes<00:01:57.310> that's

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
increase so that is crazy so yes that's

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.000 
increase so that is crazy so yes that's
a<00:01:57.610> pretty<00:01:57.760> cool<00:01:57.970> passive<00:01:58.330> and<00:01:58.620> if<00:01:59.620> we<00:01:59.740> have<00:01:59.980> a

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
a pretty cool passive and if we have a

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.220 
a pretty cool passive and if we have a
look<00:02:00.190> at<00:02:00.430> Raven<00:02:00.940> hope<00:02:01.630> a<00:02:01.780> service<00:02:02.020> called

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:02.230 
look at Raven hope a service called

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.830 
look at Raven hope a service called
demonic<00:02:02.650> rage<00:02:02.890> so<00:02:03.550> twice<00:02:03.910> permits<00:02:04.480> when<00:02:04.660> Raven

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
demonic rage so twice permits when Raven

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.960 
demonic rage so twice permits when Raven
is<00:02:05.050> below<00:02:05.290> twenty<00:02:05.590> percent<00:02:05.800> health<00:02:06.040> she<00:02:06.550> swaps

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
is below twenty percent health she swaps

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.559 
is below twenty percent health she swaps
health<00:02:07.270> with<00:02:07.540> her<00:02:07.720> opponent<00:02:08.909> which<00:02:09.909> can

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
health with her opponent which can

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.360 
health with her opponent which can
sometimes<00:02:10.869> be<00:02:11.379> bad<00:02:11.620> if<00:02:11.800> your<00:02:11.950> opponent<00:02:12.129> has

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
sometimes be bad if your opponent has

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.690 
sometimes be bad if your opponent has
less<00:02:12.760> health<00:02:13.060> than<00:02:13.300> her<00:02:13.450> but<00:02:14.440> anyway<00:02:14.800> so<00:02:15.550> now

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
less health than her but anyway so now

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.540 
less health than her but anyway so now
we're<00:02:15.819> going<00:02:15.909> to<00:02:15.970> go<00:02:16.120> through<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.420> gears<00:02:17.550> so

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
we're going to go through the gears so
