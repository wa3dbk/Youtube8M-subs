00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:07.069
 good morning and welcome to clinic 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.120
 dental specialists in rehabilitation 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:10.280
 integral 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.049
 today we will talk about the 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.839
 terrible consequences of a 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:17.030
 dental extraction or more generally 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:20.630
 of the consequences of the loss of 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:22.970
 dental pieces many times is common 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.210
 hear my tooth hurts I'm going to 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.900
 or get me what I broke the grindstone salt 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.150
 what the dr 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.270
 He suffered an accident and I ended up losing 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.660
 several teeth 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:38.930
 and I lost my teeth in a fight in a 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.070
 car crash etcetera in short a 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.040
 series of reasons that caused 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.600
 involuntary tooth losses that we 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.700
 carry at some time of our 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.920
 lives to wish to recover those spaces 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:54.370
 lost and recover our smiles 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.350
 Thus emerges sooner rather than later 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.320
 in us the desire to re-cover 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.380
 those empty spaces 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.170
 we checked how uncomfortable and annoying 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.180
 the dental absence results not only for 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.850
 show a wide and natural smile 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.979
 but the most important thing to feed us 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.130
 properly to chew well 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.960
 our food starts to recharge 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.700
 chewing on one side what 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.450
 caused a greater wear of the pieces 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.270
 in good state 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.509
 we can not chew solid foods 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.780
 we lose skills to cut rip 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.500
 or pull certain foods or lose 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.880
 crushing skills and finally 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:37.399
 we suffer an unleashing of 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.399
 problems that are activated one after the other 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:43.999
 but maybe this is not yet known by all 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:45.799
 The above problems are 

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:48.770
 completely perceptible because the 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:51.439
 you see or you feel them but there is a problem 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.819
 more that it is not possible to detect unless 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:55.969
 that is subjected to an analysis 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:58.939
 radiographic professional I talk to you about the 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:03.220
 Bone resorption or bone loss by 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:05.440
 resorption due to dental loss 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.649
 so you can clearly understand the 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.290
 seriousness that involves losing parts 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.970
 dental and not replace the on time I will 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.440
 show you a video that I hope I can 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.440
 guide you better respect 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.330
 we know that all our teeth are 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:27.200
 subject firmly to the maxilla now well 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.030
 infections cavities or bumps 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.630
 can cause the loss of 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.430
 teeth not always and eye not always already 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.560
 that currently all these causes 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.349
 they can be perfectly controlled and 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.510
 reversed today could be said that 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.880
 losing a tooth is the biggest 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.190
 percentage by exclusive decision of 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.280
 patient since there are multiple 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.440
 alternatives to save them or for 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.890
 visit a toothbrush and not a surgeon 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.600
 dentist committed to his health 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.000
 advanced dental techniques such as 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.430
 endodontics in my section is an architect 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.580
 my periodontal surgeries is fierce liz 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.319
 actions and so on make up some of 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.690
 the various techniques that our 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.459
 clinics put into practice for 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.290
 increase the rescue of the pieces 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.590
 natural teeth of our patients 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.760
 and so avoid at all costs the loss of 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.260
 its natural roots 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.579
 but let's put ourselves in the worst case 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.220
 we design the assumption in which 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:30.790
 we ended up losing a tooth and this 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.280
 it is not replaced immediately 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.629
 fact provokes with the passage of 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:40.870
 time a very negative and harmful effect 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:43.930
 for our health a difficult effect of 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:47.220
 perceive because we do not see it does not show 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:50.620
 no symptoms do not hurt, just advance 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:53.349
 progresses and progresses progressively and 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:57.099
 permanently I refer to the 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:59.709
 bone resorption is to say the process by 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:03.340
 which the bone surrounding the piece 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:07.480
 lost or extracted begins to collapse 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:10.269
 to retreat to shrink to get lost in 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.459
 irreversible process and that we can not 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:14.730
 stop unless we make your 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:17.370
 replacement 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.829
 Of course the problem is not just the 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:23.190
 continuous loss and retraction of the bone 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:25.290
 in this area in reality this is just the 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.750
 start of the problem without a support 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:30.240
 adjacent adjacent teeth 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.400
 will begin to move towards the area 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.790
 of the lost bone unleashing the 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.310
 displacement of adjacent teeth 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:40.680
 causing a chain reaction the 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.199
 amount of bone lost and the pattern of 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.060
 displacement will vary depending on the 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:49.320
 patient and the location of the tooth 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:51.600
 lost so a simple extraction is 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:54.930
 ends up turning into a serious 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:58.410
 problem will generate movement of others 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.990
 teeth the extrusion or expulsion of their 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.389
 cavities in others the appearance of 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.639
 diseases like streets and inflammation 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:08.430
 of tissues caused by a deficient 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:10.970
 hygiene in these new difficult areas 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.970
 access 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.830
 well this is what we wanted that 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:19.290
 learn today is to say that 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.720
 consider how critical the 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:24.810
 lose our teeth without 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:27.070
 before not trying to save them all 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.590
 the possible means 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:32.460
 It is timely portal that reminds you that 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:36.220
 in case of having broken pieces 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.930
 fractured or dental remains do everything 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.240
 possible to find a clinic 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:43.180
 dental that offers you an alternative 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:47.720
 solution to be able to save the pieces or 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:51.770
 save your natural dental roots 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:54.770
 therefore and as a summary 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.930
 do not allow for any reason that you 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.860
 extract the teeth to get you 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.699
 prosthesis 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:04.280
 crowns or dental implants without first 

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:07.159
 do not have the certainty that these pieces 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:10.909
 teeth can not be saved or 

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:14.030
 recovered this will only cause you greater 

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:17.110
 health problems and of course a 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:19.990
 great spending of money
