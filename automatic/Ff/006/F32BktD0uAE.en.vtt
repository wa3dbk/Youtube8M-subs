because I don't want it to get removed
by<00:03:30.299> YouTube<00:03:30.750> I<00:03:31.220> believe<00:03:32.220> that<00:03:32.519> breaks<00:03:32.879> their

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
by YouTube I believe that breaks their

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.879 
by YouTube I believe that breaks their
terms<00:03:33.329> of<00:03:33.480> service<00:03:33.540> i'm<00:03:34.079> not<00:03:34.290> entirely<00:03:34.650> sure

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 
terms of service i'm not entirely sure

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:36.439 
terms of service i'm not entirely sure
but<00:03:35.129> i<00:03:35.340> do<00:03:35.459> think<00:03:35.579> that<00:03:35.879> i<00:03:36.000> could<00:03:36.060> have<00:03:36.299> been

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:36.449 
but i do think that i could have been

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:38.780 
but i do think that i could have been
funnier<00:03:36.989> in<00:03:37.169> that<00:03:37.410> video<00:03:37.590> but<00:03:37.919> that<00:03:38.129> sort<00:03:38.730> of

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
funnier in that video but that sort of

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.599 
funnier in that video but that sort of
besides<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.389> point<00:03:39.829> there's<00:03:40.829> a<00:03:40.949> lot<00:03:41.280> to<00:03:41.459> make

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
besides the point there's a lot to make

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:43.580 
besides the point there's a lot to make
fun<00:03:41.849> of<00:03:41.879> what<00:03:42.120> this<00:03:42.299> guy<00:03:42.510> i<00:03:42.720> really<00:03:43.440> do<00:03:43.560> not

for<00:04:00.269> many<00:04:00.569> of<00:04:00.690> you<00:04:00.870> to<00:04:00.959> understand<00:04:01.379> because

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
for many of you to understand because

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.379 
for many of you to understand because
most<00:04:02.099> people<00:04:02.459> haven't<00:04:02.879> played<00:04:03.090> this<00:04:03.269> game

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389 
most people haven't played this game

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:06.229 
most people haven't played this game
because<00:04:03.780> really<00:04:04.199> it<00:04:04.409> does<00:04:04.680> kind<00:04:05.040> of<00:04:05.159> suck<00:04:05.549> but

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
because really it does kind of suck but

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.210 
because really it does kind of suck but
if<00:04:06.419> you<00:04:06.659> did<00:04:06.930> play<00:04:07.230> this<00:04:07.379> game<00:04:07.620> you<00:04:08.010> would

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
if you did play this game you would

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.759 
if you did play this game you would
realize<00:04:08.699> that<00:04:09.269> he<00:04:09.720> is<00:04:09.750> completely<00:04:10.409> missing

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
realize that he is completely missing

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.309 
realize that he is completely missing
the<00:04:11.040> mark<00:04:11.280> on<00:04:11.519> a<00:04:11.609> lot<00:04:12.180> of<00:04:12.389> points<00:04:12.840> where<00:04:13.049> it's

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
the mark on a lot of points where it's

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.319 
the mark on a lot of points where it's
very<00:04:13.709> evident<00:04:13.889> that<00:04:14.340> he<00:04:14.549> didn't<00:04:14.849> put<00:04:15.120> that

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
very evident that he didn't put that

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:17.689 
very evident that he didn't put that
much<00:04:15.690> time<00:04:15.959> into<00:04:16.229> the<00:04:16.409> game<00:04:16.590> I'm<00:04:17.070> guessing<00:04:17.549> he

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699 
much time into the game I'm guessing he

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:19.849 
much time into the game I'm guessing he
only<00:04:17.849> put<00:04:18.150> in<00:04:18.299> about<00:04:18.449> an<00:04:18.810> hour<00:04:19.019> and<00:04:19.380> a<00:04:19.409> half<00:04:19.620> and

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
only put in about an hour and a half and

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.129 
only put in about an hour and a half and
that's<00:04:19.979> just<00:04:20.280> not<00:04:20.669> enough<00:04:20.880> and<00:04:21.329> I<00:04:21.750> know<00:04:21.810> he's

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
that's just not enough and I know he's

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:23.779 
that's just not enough and I know he's
done<00:04:22.349> this<00:04:22.500> on<00:04:22.680> a<00:04:22.710> few<00:04:23.010> other<00:04:23.159> videos<00:04:23.550> as<00:04:23.760> well

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
done this on a few other videos as well

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:24.780 
done this on a few other videos as well
and<00:04:24.300> I<00:04:24.330> mean

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790
