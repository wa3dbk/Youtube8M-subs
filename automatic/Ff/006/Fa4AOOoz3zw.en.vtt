00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:24.219
 falling in water they occupy a position with 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:24.219
 slightly tilted head down 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.600
 it improves the game of bait and 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.450
 additionally prevents burglary 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:38.619
 hook for fishing line immediately after casting

 coloring pages

 on uniform wiring silver syringe 40 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:02:00.180
 and 50 have active not tense 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:02.729
 medium frequency play if unnecessarily 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.960
 increases wiring speed then wobbler 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.960
 starts to rise to the surface 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.280
 lures are very different 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.310
 it is only important to avoid unnecessary harsh 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:32.520
 jerks in the arc hooks are not twisted for 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:35.040
 fishing line if you catch 2 components 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.610
 the bait is sometimes much better than twitching 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.100
 different wiring options work 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.650
 stop ingu soft braces 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.200
 rods on the suspenders lure with the game 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.330
 rises up and pauses to sink 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.720
 it very well provokes fish to 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.720
 so 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.150
 wobblers of silver series spread 40 and 50 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.370
 millimeters 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.859
 Excellent at catching on 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.000
 standing waters however if you 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:07.430
 get on the river 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.530
 they work very well there too 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.579
 these kids are great to catch such 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:15.370
 fish like a perch 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:15.370
 trout head and small pike 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.510
 to my mind
