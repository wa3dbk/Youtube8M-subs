00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:11.450
 Hello dear friends with you as 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.639
 usually gleb and today review 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.520
 American heavy stalk seventh 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.950
 FMF level code tiger is wonderful 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.990
 heir replace 8j and predecessor for 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.120
 midi that cookies so go 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.220
 he was created as a heavy deck 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.830
 fighter for the us fleet model was 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.539
 created on the basis of the groom on the pi pi 65 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.090
 only about three hundred released 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.670
 planes in our game he has a great 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.360
 enriched firepower speeds as well 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.030
 altitude 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.829
 but more about that speed because 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.660
 we cry you heavy fighter we have two 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.620
 engine and that means huge 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.390
 afterburner amount 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.730
 from the start can get you to 103 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.870
 thousands of meters and even higher but still 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.210
 stage speed 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.010
 a little better animal a little worse harn 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.930
 this but again considering mass 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.059
 aircraft then sv linga power density 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.500
 will be more 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.719
 maneuverability wow here strangely enough all 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.910
 well among the two competitors we are better 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.860
 but don't be so happy and forget 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.320
 exactly with huge mass and speed to us 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.850
 will reset not so easy and trite more often 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.130
 just zwilling their rent will be 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.470
 much less speed than you have because 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.520
 that they know how to slow down and here we are 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.830
 dart is not in the teeth 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.450
 go ahead firepower in the top about 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.280
 configurations we are again the middlegirl 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.770
 and a lot worse than a linga bit better 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.630
 harta twenty of us very even and accurately 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.729
 completely weak overheating so 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.560
 you can water anywhere zynga we 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.450
 of course not shoot but forint 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.560
 you can try it is worth considering 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.689
 outboard weapon 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.729
 as we have it very much and in 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:37.100
 first 1000 pound bomb with damage 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.560
 12,000 units of this is enough to kill 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.850
 headquarters but with eight more missiles with 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.920
 1400 damage 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.810
 if you suddenly hell and shoot down planes then 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.299
 you can easily go crush the ground 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.009
 and in the end strength usually we are not here 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.420
 stop but here we have the most 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.759
 high rate in the thin case 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.920
 as many as four hundred eighty and a bottom that 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.689
 80 more than the corrector so you can 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.299
 catch a few random rounds and 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.340
 so we go into the tactics of warfare regret 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.080
 with altitude we have exhausted and worst 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.730
 haron you are taller 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.320
 it doesn't bother us at all you exactly 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.210
 also climb three kilometers and 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.430
 I feel there is normal priority 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.450
 goals arrogant high - altitude type 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.400
 mustang hoods 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.170
 killing them we feel much better 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.790
 and we can easily beat everyone 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.170
 the rest but again not worth it 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.570
 forget your weapon 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.880
 we can easily cut off any aircraft and 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.740
 while not really bothering so 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.780
 can walk forehead and left and right and 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.280
 wherever you like the main thing not to forget 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.430
 play from the height and everything will be fine 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.290
 we go modules but since we are tall 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.570
 no sight and polishing can not do 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.160
 then you can optionally if you often 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.120
 Substitute that you can put the system 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.550
 fire extinguishing 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.709
 and in service shove gasoline if 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.140
 your forehead and you don't need petrol that system 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.090
 you don't need enough fire extinguisher then 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.459
 more appropriate armor plates or reinforced 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.709
 trim further maintenance wear 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.840
 Gold ammunition is worth it 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.570
 bonuses you saw a little faster 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.580
 Further restarting the first-aid kit about gasoline 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:00.860
 I have already said that, in principle, everything 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.240
 let's summarize we are a great spiderman with 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.920
 excellent speed of firepower 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.750
 direct his strengths to 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.730
 the right direction and you will be successful 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.660
 cities today all subscribe to 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.150
 channel and group vk 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.110
 put likes and until new meetings oh no and 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.110
 good luck air
