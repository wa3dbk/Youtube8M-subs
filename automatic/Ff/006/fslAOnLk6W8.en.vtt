00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
with holes in it his fence i guess and i

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.300 
with holes in it his fence i guess and i
got<00:01:39.750> this<00:01:39.869> little<00:01:40.020> wall<00:01:40.290> so<00:01:40.650> i<00:01:40.829> guess<00:01:41.070> i<00:01:41.159> got

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
got this little wall so i guess i got

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.319

kill streaks you your killstreak wrists

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.699 
kill streaks you your killstreak wrists
no<00:03:09.239> technically<00:03:09.659> doesn't<00:03:09.900> reset<00:03:10.319> it<00:03:10.500> just

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
no technically doesn't reset it just

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.100 
no technically doesn't reset it just
starts<00:03:11.010> over<00:03:11.430> so<00:03:12.000> you<00:03:12.090> can<00:03:12.300> get<00:03:12.450> more<00:03:12.780> of<00:03:13.080> that

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
starts over so you can get more of that

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.250 
starts over so you can get more of that
kill<00:03:13.500> streak<00:03:13.709> and<00:03:13.860> yeah<00:03:14.849> I<00:03:14.879> die<00:03:15.000> but<00:03:15.569> that's

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
kill streak and yeah I die but that's

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.690 
kill streak and yeah I die but that's
also<00:03:16.470> one<00:03:16.739> spawn<00:03:16.980> point<00:03:17.280> i<00:03:17.370> forgot<00:03:17.580> to<00:03:17.610> mention

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
also one spawn point i forgot to mention

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.339 
also one spawn point i forgot to mention
it's<00:03:18.090> right<00:03:18.209> on<00:03:18.239> the<00:03:18.420> stairs<00:03:18.540> there<00:03:18.870> which<00:03:19.319> is

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
it's right on the stairs there which is

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.740 
it's right on the stairs there which is
kind<00:03:19.890> of<00:03:19.950> stupid<00:03:20.129> but<00:03:20.580> I<00:03:20.790> don't<00:03:21.540> know<00:03:21.599> it<00:03:21.720> seems

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
kind of stupid but I don't know it seems

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.259 
kind of stupid but I don't know it seems
like<00:03:21.959> the<00:03:22.140> spawn<00:03:22.590> points<00:03:23.129> are<00:03:23.310> in<00:03:23.670> this<00:03:24.060> game

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
like the spawn points are in this game

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.479 
like the spawn points are in this game
are<00:03:24.480> a<00:03:24.540> lot<00:03:24.810> closer<00:03:25.080> I<00:03:25.290> guess<00:03:25.620> that's<00:03:25.830> mean

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
are a lot closer I guess that's mean

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:27.680 
are a lot closer I guess that's mean
they<00:03:26.580> got<00:03:26.730> they<00:03:26.909> wanted<00:03:27.180> to<00:03:27.239> make<00:03:27.360> it<00:03:27.480> a<00:03:27.540> lot

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
they got they wanted to make it a lot

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.869 
they got they wanted to make it a lot
more<00:03:27.840> action<00:03:28.049> packed<00:03:28.409> i<00:03:28.620> guess<00:03:28.830> a<00:03:29.040> lot<00:03:29.730> more

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 
more action packed i guess a lot more

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:32.449 
more action packed i guess a lot more
faster<00:03:30.390> and<00:03:30.569> everything<00:03:30.870> but<00:03:31.080> i<00:03:31.370> don't<00:03:32.370> know<00:03:32.400> i

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
faster and everything but i don't know i

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.820 
faster and everything but i don't know i
don't<00:03:32.549> like<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.720> spawns<00:03:33.989> kind<00:03:34.349> of<00:03:34.409> close<00:03:34.590> but

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
don't like the spawns kind of close but

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.149 
don't like the spawns kind of close but
then<00:03:34.950> again<00:03:35.069> they<00:03:35.280> can<00:03:35.700> take<00:03:35.849> you<00:03:36.000> off<00:03:36.150> guard

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:37.159 
then again they can take you off guard

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:41.869 
then again they can take you off guard
quite<00:03:38.159> a<00:03:38.190> bit<00:03:38.280> in<00:03:38.790> this<00:03:39.360> game<00:03:39.569> but<00:03:39.870> yeah<00:03:40.739> um<00:03:40.980> so

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 
quite a bit in this game but yeah um so

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.000 
quite a bit in this game but yeah um so

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:29.600 
what the with the PP 90 m 1 gameplay
when<00:05:28.259> instead<00:05:28.500> of<00:05:28.650> being<00:05:28.830> it<00:05:28.949> out<00:05:29.129> it's

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
when instead of being it out it's

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.490 
when instead of being it out it's
actually<00:05:29.969> closer<00:05:30.150> to<00:05:30.330> your<00:05:30.630> head<00:05:30.779> so<00:05:31.229> it<00:05:31.319> looks

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
actually closer to your head so it looks

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.450 
actually closer to your head so it looks
like<00:05:31.560> you're<00:05:31.680> I<00:05:32.180> don't<00:05:33.180> like<00:05:33.479> your<00:05:33.630> eyes<00:05:33.810> are

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:37.229 
you know it gives a feeling that your

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:40.459 
you know it gives a feeling that your
player<00:05:37.500> has<00:05:37.800> really<00:05:38.190> horrible<00:05:38.669> eyesight<00:05:39.469> but

00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:40.469 
player has really horrible eyesight but

00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:42.709 
player has really horrible eyesight but
in<00:05:40.770> that<00:05:41.159> case<00:05:41.219> I<00:05:41.430> mean<00:05:41.610> it's<00:05:41.789> okay<00:05:42.150> but<00:05:42.539> I<00:05:42.569> mean

00:05:42.709 --> 00:05:42.719

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:44.089 
in that case I mean it's okay but I mean
I<00:05:42.779> don't<00:05:43.020> really<00:05:43.050> use<00:05:43.409> theater<00:05:43.710> a<00:05:43.740> whole<00:05:43.919> lot

played um but i don't know it's just
kind<00:06:06.810> of<00:06:06.870> weird<00:06:06.930> that<00:06:07.349> you<00:06:08.009> know<00:06:08.039> i<00:06:08.550> guess<00:06:08.849> it

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
kind of weird that you know i guess it

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.369

was<00:06:09.029> sober<00:06:09.419> like<00:06:09.569> I<00:06:09.719> guess<00:06:09.900> you<00:06:10.050> know<00:06:10.139> there's

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:10.379

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:15.479 
so that's probably why but that's
