00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.820
 action of a job up to intelligence 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.769
 because they already knew that these 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.660
 bandits would be acting in the region 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.910

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.619
 the fact began around 19 hours 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.689
 where the gang eventually robbed the 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.000

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.550
 until then which city would be victimized 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.129
 against the marginal is more to leave the 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.770
 the city and came across the 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.960
 where the stop order was issued 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.750
 but they did not comply with the order to stop 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.670
 is to start one and fire at 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.980
 the police teams where there was 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.320
 first confrontation is that of an individual 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.120

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.520
 blood within that vehicle that was 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.930
 found after this they retired 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.990
 the crime scene is taking the error to br 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.790
 2009 where the driver of the vehicle lost his 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.080
 control of the car ended up falling then 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.420
 here is my kill 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.760
 the three said local flight of the facts in the 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.790
 vehicle confrontation and stop col 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.110
 is and in the sequence one ended up going 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.540
 again confrontation with the team 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.409
 where he decided then died 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.240
 on site 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.470
 it's here in the middle of killing our teams 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.840
 police are currently carrying out 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.119
 you search so that there is 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.100
 identification and approach of the two 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.530
 individuals who practice this crime 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.530
 it should also be noted that it is a vehicle 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.530
 Pejô was the beater of that vehicle. 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.930
 stolen or they had before 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.270
 is the vehicle stolen in the city of deraa 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.070
 fleas is checking if there is 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.380
 then possibility of occurrence o 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.049
 crime is that vehicle was identified 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.970
 was approached was located together too 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.369
 two people were arrested in that vehicle 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.829
 and are being presented to the police station 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.729
 police because they are involved in this 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.460
 crime committed 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.520
 weapons were found 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.680
 action both together with the individual was 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.530
 was shot and one death was found 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.290
 firearm is also explosives have been 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.739
 found on the vehicle that is here is 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.049
 identified and isolated is not for 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.629
 the arrival of criminalistics and 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:24.239
 military police specialist 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:26.189
 in pumps so that there will be withdrawal 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.109
 of these vehicle objects 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:30.750
 the lieutenant this explosive found and 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:33.599
 not detonated leads the police to believe that 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.670
 they could still act at dawn in 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.290
 another city here of the region is 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.379
 probably they would have practiced 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.459
 this crime and withdraw them to put the 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.530
 other location 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.720
 we do not know that they would act in 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.970
 another city or if they were going to 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.269
 It's shot and it's from London. 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.680
 city but it is what it is noteworthy that 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:57.530
 there was confrontation is that the police acted 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:59.609
 quickly is achieved then there will be 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.109
 seizure and imprisonment in which the 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:03.180
 unfortunately, died 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:04.739
 but the individual was identified and 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.349
 We hope and want with this not seen 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.239
 plus the cpi are not from the other two that 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:10.739
 they are still in the woods 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.680
 possibility of someone being injured 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:16.919
 probably also a wounded individual 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.900
 is what was hurt by the confrontation 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:21.090
 police officer but I'm not sure 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.370
 if the one who came to death was what 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.040
 was hurt our certainty we need 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.500
 identifying them is so that 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.479
 there is certainty of this situation 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.459
 on the side of the military police 

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:34.440
 no problem no one left 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:38.549
 injured not thank god we police 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.470

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.840
 that ask the vehicles were shot 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.629
 several shots were fired in 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.159
 our two policemen but this is the 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:50.030
 less than thanks to God our 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:50.030
