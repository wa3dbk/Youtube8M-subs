00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
like my hands is doing all the thinking

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.430 
like my hands is doing all the thinking
and<00:00:02.220> does<00:00:02.399> like<00:00:02.550> the<00:00:03.179> correct<00:00:03.510> decisions<00:00:04.080> and

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
and does like the correct decisions and

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.650 
and does like the correct decisions and
the<00:00:04.980> correct<00:00:05.660> punishment<00:00:06.660> every<00:00:07.350> time<00:00:08.030> like<00:00:09.030> I

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
the correct punishment every time like I

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.089 
the correct punishment every time like I
guess<00:00:09.990> like<00:00:10.019> we<00:00:10.290> don't<00:00:10.500> expect<00:00:10.710> good<00:00:10.860> I<00:00:10.950> really

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
guess like we don't expect good I really

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.759 
guess like we don't expect good I really
don't<00:00:11.370> think<00:00:11.429> about<00:00:11.670> it<00:00:11.910> like<00:00:12.599> I<00:00:12.900> guess<00:00:13.590> it's

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
don't think about it like I guess it's

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.150 
don't think about it like I guess it's
just<00:00:13.799> when<00:00:14.519> I'm<00:00:14.639> in<00:00:14.759> that<00:00:14.790> zone<00:00:14.969> where<00:00:16.160> Lords

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
just when I'm in that zone where Lords

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.540 
just when I'm in that zone where Lords
don't<00:00:17.400> think<00:00:17.580> yeah<00:00:17.789> we<00:00:17.940> know<00:00:18.060> you<00:00:18.119> get<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.570> me

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
don't think yeah we know you get to me

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.050 
don't think yeah we know you get to me
this<00:00:20.550> zone<00:00:20.760> where<00:00:21.029> I'm<00:00:21.359> playing<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:22.760> all<00:00:23.760> the

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
this zone where I'm playing and all the

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.040 
this zone where I'm playing and all the
other<00:00:24.240> actions<00:00:24.539> are<00:00:25.640> not<00:00:26.640> being<00:00:27.269> set<00:00:27.840> in<00:00:27.869> my

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
other actions are not being set in my

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.740 
other actions are not being set in my
head<00:00:28.080> are<00:00:28.980> being<00:00:29.279> said<00:00:29.609> what<00:00:30.449> you<00:00:30.539> want<00:00:30.689> to

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
head are being said what you want to

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.569 
head are being said what you want to
touch<00:00:30.900> into<00:00:31.109> control

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:33.579 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.130 

it's<00:00:34.390> a<00:00:34.450> hyper<00:00:34.660> intuition

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.950 

like<00:00:38.740> most<00:00:39.010> people<00:00:39.480> they<00:00:40.480> they<00:00:40.690> say<00:00:40.840> they

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
like most people they they say they

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.170 
like most people they they say they
think<00:00:41.020> during<00:00:41.470> the<00:00:41.680> matches<00:00:41.860> but<00:00:42.220> I<00:00:42.550> feel<00:00:43.060> like

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
think during the matches but I feel like

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.700 
think during the matches but I feel like
that's<00:00:43.270> the<00:00:43.420> wrong<00:00:43.600> way<00:00:43.750> to<00:00:43.780> go<00:00:43.900> about<00:00:43.990> it<00:00:44.380> is<00:00:44.530> I

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
that's the wrong way to go about it is I

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.560 
that's the wrong way to go about it is I
feel<00:00:44.920> my<00:00:45.280> way<00:00:45.460> is<00:00:45.640> basically<00:00:46.120> through

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
feel my way is basically through

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.160 
feel my way is basically through
instincts<00:00:47.290> and<00:00:47.550> just<00:00:48.550> like<00:00:49.330> how<00:00:49.480> I<00:00:49.510> feel<00:00:49.900> it

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
instincts and just like how I feel it

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.100 
instincts and just like how I feel it
just<00:00:50.440> comes<00:00:50.800> out<00:00:50.950> like<00:00:51.250> I<00:00:51.910> don't<00:00:52.420> really<00:00:52.570> like

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
just comes out like I don't really like

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.620 
just comes out like I don't really like
because<00:00:53.890> I<00:00:53.980> think<00:00:54.040> thinking<00:00:54.610> takes<00:00:55.420> too<00:00:55.600> long

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:55.630 
because I think thinking takes too long

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.360 
because I think thinking takes too long
especially<00:00:56.170> in<00:00:56.710> the<00:00:56.800> games<00:00:57.040> because<00:00:57.280> they're

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
especially in the games because they're

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.580 
especially in the games because they're
really<00:00:57.580> fast<00:00:57.940> fast<00:00:58.540> paced<00:00:58.809> where<00:00:59.380> you<00:00:59.470> don't

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
really fast fast paced where you don't

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.570 
really fast fast paced where you don't
have<00:00:59.680> enough<00:00:59.890> time<00:01:00.070> to<00:01:00.130> think<00:01:01.500> but<00:01:02.580> training

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580 
have enough time to think but training

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.230 
have enough time to think but training
them<00:01:04.890> yeah<00:01:05.920> training<00:01:06.370> more<00:01:06.520> I<00:01:06.550> do<00:01:06.670> think<00:01:07.090> about

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
them yeah training more I do think about

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.760 
them yeah training more I do think about
like<00:01:07.510> certain<00:01:07.720> strategies<00:01:08.260> on<00:01:08.410> what<00:01:08.590> to<00:01:08.680> look

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
like certain strategies on what to look

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.130 
like certain strategies on what to look
out<00:01:08.920> for<00:01:08.979> but<00:01:09.910> then<00:01:10.030> once<00:01:10.240> I<00:01:10.360> start<00:01:10.810> once<00:01:11.020> I

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
out for but then once I start once I

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.290 
out for but then once I start once I
find<00:01:11.410> out<00:01:11.500> a<00:01:11.560> new<00:01:11.710> strategy<00:01:11.920> it's<00:01:12.759> registered

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
find out a new strategy it's registered

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.350 
find out a new strategy it's registered
in<00:01:13.509> my<00:01:13.570> in<00:01:14.259> my<00:01:14.320> pants<00:01:15.009> so<00:01:15.910> I<00:01:15.940> don't<00:01:16.180> have<00:01:16.270> to

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
in my in my pants so I don't have to

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.660 
in my in my pants so I don't have to
really<00:01:16.509> worry<00:01:16.840> father<00:01:17.410> in<00:01:17.590> the<00:01:17.800> future<00:01:18.130> when<00:01:18.640> I

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
really worry father in the future when I

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.100 
really worry father in the future when I
watch<00:01:18.850> to<00:01:18.970> have<00:01:19.060> these<00:01:19.210> players<00:01:19.390> play<00:01:19.509> I<00:01:19.869> just

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
watch to have these players play I just

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.770 
watch to have these players play I just
feel<00:01:20.320> like<00:01:20.729> they<00:01:21.729> just<00:01:21.910> don't<00:01:22.060> care<00:01:22.330> like<00:01:22.750> you

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
feel like they just don't care like you

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.969 
feel like they just don't care like you
just<00:01:23.250> whatever<00:01:24.250> they<00:01:24.520> press<00:01:24.790> it's<00:01:25.300> gonna<00:01:25.479> work

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
just whatever they press it's gonna work

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.380 
just whatever they press it's gonna work
that's<00:01:26.979> how<00:01:27.130> I<00:01:27.160> think<00:01:27.399> they<00:01:27.490> feel<00:01:27.670> that's<00:01:28.180> why

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
that's how I think they feel that's why

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.389 
that's how I think they feel that's why
I<00:01:28.420> like<00:01:28.600> we<00:01:29.410> do<00:01:29.530> pretty<00:01:29.770> good<00:01:29.979> against<00:01:30.190> them

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
I like we do pretty good against them

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:32.999 
I like we do pretty good against them
because<00:01:31.149> it's<00:01:32.050> not<00:01:32.170> that<00:01:32.320> we<00:01:32.500> think<00:01:32.530> what's

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
because it's not that we think what's

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.969 
because it's not that we think what's
that<00:01:33.280> when<00:01:33.910> we<00:01:34.000> play<00:01:34.270> with<00:01:34.450> more<00:01:34.979> defensive

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
that when we play with more defensive

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:37.940 
that when we play with more defensive
than<00:01:36.130> aggressive<00:01:36.640> like<00:01:36.970> Spanish

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
than aggressive like Spanish

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.710 
than aggressive like Spanish
like<00:01:38.990> like<00:01:39.990> Japan<00:01:40.380> players<00:01:40.650> they<00:01:41.549> just<00:01:41.820> let

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
like like Japan players they just let

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.219 
like like Japan players they just let
moves<00:01:43.020> rock<00:01:43.290> well<00:01:44.159> if<00:01:44.729> we<00:01:44.909> see<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.210> move<00:01:45.420> it's

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
moves rock well if we see that move it's

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.200 
moves rock well if we see that move it's
gonna<00:01:46.409> they're<00:01:46.740> gonna<00:01:46.799> pay<00:01:47.070> for<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.399> like<00:01:47.909> our

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
gonna they're gonna pay for it like our

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.550 
gonna they're gonna pay for it like our
reaction<00:01:48.659> times<00:01:48.930> are<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.080> lot<00:01:49.259> better<00:01:49.470> than

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
reaction times are a lot better than

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.200 
reaction times are a lot better than
Japan's<00:01:51.470> you<00:01:52.470> can<00:01:52.619> say<00:01:52.770> like<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.909> way<00:01:54.030> the

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
Japan's you can say like the way the

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.880 
Japan's you can say like the way the
Korean<00:01:54.509> champion<00:01:54.899> boompole<00:01:55.259> is<00:01:55.409> playing

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
Korean champion boompole is playing

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.260

he's<00:01:56.759> like<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:56.940> spear<00:01:57.570> she'd<00:01:58.259> go<00:01:58.440> straight<00:01:59.060> Wow

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270

it's like you can say that gets a

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.150 
it's like you can say that gets a
Spartan<00:02:04.850> Wow<00:02:06.049> who's<00:02:07.049> low<00:02:07.229> is<00:02:07.500> like<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.770> Spartan

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
Spartan Wow who's low is like a Spartan

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.050 
Spartan Wow who's low is like a Spartan
without<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.459> shield

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
without a shield

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.850 
without a shield
yeah<00:02:09.690> your<00:02:09.810> plane<00:02:10.019> basically<00:02:10.590> kind<00:02:10.800> of

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
yeah your plane basically kind of

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.280 
yeah your plane basically kind of
program<00:02:11.430> it'll<00:02:11.670> plays<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.300> guess<00:02:12.930> still<00:02:13.080> takes

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
program it'll plays I guess still takes

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.720 
program it'll plays I guess still takes
a<00:02:13.380> lot<00:02:13.500> of<00:02:13.590> eye<00:02:13.709> coordination<00:02:14.160> a<00:02:14.430> lot<00:02:14.580> of

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
a lot of eye coordination a lot of

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.300 
a lot of eye coordination a lot of
concentration<00:02:15.450> because<00:02:16.410> to<00:02:16.860> getting<00:02:17.130> to<00:02:17.280> that

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
concentration because to getting to that

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.270 
concentration because to getting to that
high<00:02:17.580> score<00:02:17.940> is<00:02:18.690> pretty<00:02:18.989> like<00:02:19.380> pretty<00:02:20.040> hard

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
high score is pretty like pretty hard

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.309 
high score is pretty like pretty hard
like<00:02:20.549> there's<00:02:21.120> a<00:02:21.180> whole<00:02:21.299> pac-man<00:02:21.810> Donkey<00:02:22.019> Kong

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
like there's a whole pac-man Donkey Kong

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:23.870 
like there's a whole pac-man Donkey Kong
where<00:02:22.590> you<00:02:22.680> got<00:02:22.799> to<00:02:22.890> go<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.010> always<00:02:23.489> the<00:02:23.610> kill

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
where you got to go to always the kill

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.130 
where you got to go to always the kill
screen<00:02:24.030> which<00:02:24.239> takes<00:02:24.480> like<00:02:24.630> three<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:24.930> four

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
screen which takes like three to four

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.470 
screen which takes like three to four
three<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:25.590> five<00:02:25.769> hours<00:02:26.100> it's<00:02:26.880> an<00:02:27.060> endurance

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
three to five hours it's an endurance

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.520 
three to five hours it's an endurance
and<00:02:27.840> that's<00:02:28.830> like<00:02:29.160> I<00:02:29.459> guess<00:02:30.299> not<00:02:30.600> on<00:02:30.810> what<00:02:31.290> we

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
and that's like I guess not on what we

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.230 
and that's like I guess not on what we
do<00:02:31.769> as<00:02:32.069> fighting

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
do as fighting

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.590 
do as fighting
also<00:02:34.110> a<00:02:34.410> skill<00:02:35.100> that<00:02:36.090> you<00:02:36.270> will<00:02:36.360> need<00:02:36.480> to

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
also a skill that you will need to

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.900 
also a skill that you will need to
practice<00:02:37.050> on<00:02:37.230> back<00:02:37.500> and<00:02:37.680> forth<00:02:37.890> anymore<00:02:38.040> like

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
practice on back and forth anymore like

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.390 
practice on back and forth anymore like
how<00:02:39.060> we<00:02:39.120> practice<00:02:39.510> combos<00:02:39.990> they<00:02:40.980> practice

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
how we practice combos they practice

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.110 
how we practice combos they practice
endurance

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
endurance

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.060 
endurance
I<00:02:42.150> don't<00:02:42.660> really<00:02:42.930> study<00:02:43.110> frames<00:02:43.470> at<00:02:43.650> all<00:02:43.800> I

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
I don't really study frames at all I

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.060 
I don't really study frames at all I
just<00:02:44.610> press<00:02:44.850> button<00:02:45.210> let's<00:02:45.480> see<00:02:45.630> if<00:02:45.720> it<00:02:45.810> works

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
just press button let's see if it works

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.470 
just press button let's see if it works
like<00:02:47.070> I<00:02:47.280> guess<00:02:47.460> that's<00:02:47.700> like<00:02:47.850> bootleg<00:02:48.240> frame

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
like I guess that's like bootleg frame

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.780 
like I guess that's like bootleg frame
counting<00:02:48.870> but<00:02:49.650> I<00:02:49.890> don't<00:02:50.100> really<00:02:50.250> like<00:02:50.430> okay

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
counting but I don't really like okay

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.340 
counting but I don't really like okay
this<00:02:50.910> move<00:02:51.120> is<00:02:51.270> like<00:02:51.390> 2/3<00:02:51.810> so<00:02:51.990> I'll<00:02:52.110> just<00:02:52.230> move

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
this move is like 2/3 so I'll just move

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.830 
this move is like 2/3 so I'll just move
is<00:02:52.500> 5<00:02:52.770> or<00:02:53.550> this<00:02:53.820> is<00:02:53.940> like<00:02:53.970> after<00:02:54.420> it<00:02:54.510> hits<00:02:54.720> its

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
is 5 or this is like after it hits its

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.840 
is 5 or this is like after it hits its
plus<00:02:55.080> negative<00:02:55.410> I<00:02:55.890> don't<00:02:56.460> really<00:02:56.640> like<00:02:56.820> doing

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
plus negative I don't really like doing

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.260 
plus negative I don't really like doing
all<00:02:57.450> that<00:02:57.480> type<00:02:57.750> of<00:02:57.780> stuff<00:02:58.020> cuz<00:02:58.200> I<00:02:58.410> think<00:02:58.950> it

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
all that type of stuff cuz I think it

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.550 
all that type of stuff cuz I think it
knowing<00:03:00.270> that<00:03:00.420> information<00:03:00.540> is<00:03:00.930> great<00:03:01.260> at<00:03:01.410> all

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
knowing that information is great at all

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.830 
knowing that information is great at all
but<00:03:02.370> I<00:03:02.400> really<00:03:02.700> think<00:03:02.850> it<00:03:03.000> conflicts<00:03:03.720> with

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
but I really think it conflicts with

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.470 
but I really think it conflicts with
your<00:03:03.870> gameplay<00:03:04.430> because<00:03:05.430> it<00:03:06.060> will<00:03:06.180> just<00:03:06.210> take

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
your gameplay because it will just take

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.290 
your gameplay because it will just take
more<00:03:07.200> time<00:03:07.710> out<00:03:08.610> of<00:03:08.760> your<00:03:08.820> mind<00:03:09.120> because

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
more time out of your mind because

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.280 
more time out of your mind because
you're<00:03:09.480> thinking<00:03:09.600> too<00:03:10.020> much

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
you're thinking too much

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.710 
you're thinking too much
well<00:03:11.160> if<00:03:11.490> you<00:03:11.610> just<00:03:11.790> know<00:03:12.000> which<00:03:12.240> one<00:03:12.480> beats

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
well if you just know which one beats

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.870 
well if you just know which one beats
what<00:03:12.960> and<00:03:13.800> which<00:03:14.160> one<00:03:14.340> has<00:03:14.370> more<00:03:14.640> priority

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
what and which one has more priority

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.650 
what and which one has more priority
overall<00:03:15.740> it's<00:03:16.740> a<00:03:16.830> lot<00:03:17.040> easier<00:03:17.520> to<00:03:18.000> manage<00:03:18.210> I

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
overall it's a lot easier to manage I

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.850 
overall it's a lot easier to manage I
talked<00:03:19.590> to<00:03:19.770> some<00:03:20.220> Japanese<00:03:20.580> players<00:03:20.870> but<00:03:21.870> it's

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
talked to some Japanese players but it's

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.470 
talked to some Japanese players but it's
kind<00:03:23.070> of<00:03:23.130> hard<00:03:23.370> because<00:03:23.700> their<00:03:24.000> English<00:03:24.330> is

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
kind of hard because their English is

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.390 
kind of hard because their English is
not<00:03:24.630> that<00:03:24.810> great<00:03:24.990> and<00:03:25.560> my<00:03:25.680> Japanese<00:03:26.130> is<00:03:26.250> not

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
not that great and my Japanese is not

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.420 
not that great and my Japanese is not
that<00:03:26.550> great<00:03:26.730> so<00:03:27.060> it's<00:03:27.780> more<00:03:27.990> like<00:03:28.290> I<00:03:28.590> sort

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
that great so it's more like I sort

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.390 
that great so it's more like I sort
understand<00:03:29.940> you<00:03:30.350> not<00:03:31.350> really

understand you not really

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.729 
understand you not really
it's<00:03:33.330> not<00:03:33.450> really<00:03:33.629> tricks<00:03:33.930> because<00:03:34.080> like<00:03:34.500> I

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
it's not really tricks because like I
