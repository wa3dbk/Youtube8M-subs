00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:09.120
 katys game gmbh a specialist with 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.759
 Welcome to the fight prices here 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.340
 a new episode of 415 ultimate pack 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.710
 opening and just there are 50 capex 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.690
 yes I hope you are with us 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.150
 have now directly 53 capex need 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.350
 At least a few pieces fall out of here 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.029
 they themselves once perplexed open 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.260
 Genghis Game Cards Whatever 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.720
 you need look at the description 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:33.630
 there are left to mmo is now only here 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.860
 rare player and it's all where you are 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.590
 but that works very fast now 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.730
 out how many else were after 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.399
 top 100 but it still works 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.610
 I suspect that is still 100 years ago 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.070
 capex will give that is very very 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.309
 crass we just look and fabian times 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.969
 ecri as here only on podolski we have 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.940
 everything nice 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.219
 and the rest is also to repel 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:01.109
 you only get rare games but the 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:03.870
 are all rarely shit ok next 50 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.970
 kfx fold by when the way is 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.830
 Cheap 50 capex and so on 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.479
 but not for the normal 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:20.549
 price high we take with 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:21.720
 and he is nothing in the mobile we 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.979
 must indeed be a bit picky here 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:29.040
 around 5900 ex still it is so ultrafast 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.310
 a little more consumer , I suppose 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.829
 simply times that today there is again the 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:38.220
 100 capex is just mother for it was times 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.100
 so johnson valbuena benteke all of us 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:46.439
 of course, have with essential 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:49.170
 ramos and shaqiri all relatively good 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.450
 but ultimately if they are now 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.509
 not be worth as much 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.700
 4000 ex still rom to the minute goes here 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.759
 it's straight at around the minute 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.500
 three minutes after only thus to himself 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.240
 how many times do I get silva? 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.310
 silva silva silva silva I always get 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:11.360
 Silva is simply not worth anything 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.360
 is nothing anymore but is an 87 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.930
 on the transfer list the extra 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.420
 English made because I just like that 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:21.390
 I suppose that is still in English 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.340
 Much better keeps running this way 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.870
 further on how much text is still 3000 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:31.500
 I can still be a little bit too 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:34.220
 time does not leave wrong and Peter 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:38.550
 cech okay that one is not bad - 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.019
 negredo okay we can therefore take 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.129
 marcelo we also pack on the 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:47.220
 transferlist otherwise boomer and so on 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:50.459
 continue building because it is not you now 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.530
 2000 so no from 1 pack are easy 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.560
 times so 1000 gone because we do 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.110
 two more pictures were shot by jeff 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.349
 is in the process everything we have from it 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.349
 beautiful 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:09.560
 ok last or penultimate spec oh man 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:13.010
 too bad a pity a pity so far it 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:16.099
 could have been so beautiful 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:20.060
 not even in shape, not even in 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:22.569
 Shut down papers 400 times 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.569
 one is still working 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.730
 I can now completely through you 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.000
 work out as fast as I want or capex 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.640
 make no difference 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:45.360
 we take with but also with and the 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:48.750
 rest is here repel another 800 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.750
 many things are not there anymore 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:58.360
 Criminal proceedings but I can do it ok 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.360
 to bring again 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.280
 base and transfer list 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:13.860
 pipe-beck 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:17.549
 even managed that would be right 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:24.360
 blatant and nothing at all 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:33.090
 take nothing else with benny yes 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:35.760
 martinez he still worth something 850 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.220
 bibiani here again we have 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:44.960
 five already drawn but nothing not even 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:47.010
 in shape or so okay not even in shape 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.220
 So you see, you already have a lot 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.220
 bad luck 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:55.000
 but the ufa because they are not and then 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.740
 if they are over, they change that 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.300
 went really fast five minutes it has 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:02.710
 lasted and then they were all gone like 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.320
 often we shaqiri but when I get one 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.310
 in the form of how much bad luck you have to 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.660
 actually, that's what you get out of these 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:12.570
 can not get around the packs one in shape 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:17.350
 not yet a member of this team this week 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:22.140
 Of course Messi was very horny Ericsson 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.140
 yes, here choupo-moting I had 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:27.700
 nothing else harms then looked first 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.500
 thanks again for turning on 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.420
 That was a very short episode we have 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.160
 not the cutest cut here 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.350
 pulled because they were all gone immediately 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.620
 we have a lot of packs actually 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:39.790
 also a lot of 50 capex afterwards it will be 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.530
 probably now from the car packs 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:43.330
 if I say I'm curious 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.410
 Thanks again for turning it on 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.410
