00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
taking off all the paint is what I was

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.390 
taking off all the paint is what I was
thinking<00:04:59.350> I'm<00:05:00.350> here<00:05:00.620> this<00:05:00.800> is<00:05:00.950> supposed<00:05:01.250> to<00:05:01.310> be

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
thinking I'm here this is supposed to be

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.010 
thinking I'm here this is supposed to be
my<00:05:01.550> moon<00:05:01.820> zombie<00:05:02.000> unless<00:05:02.419> you<00:05:02.570> want<00:05:02.810> me<00:05:02.930> to

my moon zombie unless you want me to

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.430 
my moon zombie unless you want me to
keep<00:05:03.200> it<00:05:03.380> make<00:05:03.680> a<00:05:03.710> different<00:05:04.160> moon<00:05:04.340> zombie<00:05:05.440> but

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
keep it make a different moon zombie but

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.550 
keep it make a different moon zombie but
I<00:05:06.470> probably<00:05:06.979> wouldn't<00:05:07.520> do<00:05:07.700> that<00:05:08.380> but<00:05:09.380> I<00:05:09.410> was

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
I probably wouldn't do that but I was

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.750 
I probably wouldn't do that but I was
thinking<00:05:09.590> about<00:05:09.919> making<00:05:10.190> samus<00:05:12.430> not<00:05:13.430> sure<00:05:13.640> if

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
thinking about making samus not sure if

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.909 
thinking about making samus not sure if
you<00:05:13.820> can<00:05:13.970> see<00:05:14.210> that<00:05:14.419> dude<00:05:14.660> but<00:05:14.900> uses<00:05:15.350> Cannon

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 
you can see that dude but uses Cannon

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:19.990 
you can see that dude but uses Cannon
and<00:05:16.039> going<00:05:16.430> over<00:05:17.090> cannon<00:05:17.840> okay<00:05:18.729> you<00:05:19.729> just<00:05:19.760> go

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
and going over cannon okay you just go

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.140 
and going over cannon okay you just go
boom<00:05:20.990> and<00:05:23.530> then<00:05:24.530> one<00:05:25.250> other<00:05:25.430> thing<00:05:25.729> I<00:05:25.940> thought

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
boom and then one other thing I thought

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:31.270 
boom and then one other thing I thought
this<00:05:26.330> would<00:05:26.479> be<00:05:26.539> really<00:05:26.930> cool<00:05:29.680> paint<00:05:30.680> this

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
this would be really cool paint this

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.690 
this would be really cool paint this
whole<00:05:31.729> thing<00:05:32.000> black<00:05:32.270> right<00:05:32.600> there<00:05:33.370> this<00:05:34.370> part

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700 
whole thing black right there this part

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:39.490 
whole thing black right there this part
and<00:05:34.960> make<00:05:35.960> daedric<00:05:36.740> armor<00:05:36.979> from<00:05:37.430> Skyrim<00:05:38.500> I'm

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
and make daedric armor from Skyrim I'm

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.969 
and make daedric armor from Skyrim I'm
not<00:05:39.830> sure<00:05:39.979> if<00:05:40.100> that's<00:05:40.250> a<00:05:40.430> good<00:05:40.610> idea<00:05:40.669> or<00:05:41.300> not<00:05:41.450> I

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:41.979 
not sure if that's a good idea or not I

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:46.990 
not sure if that's a good idea or not I
think<00:05:42.979> it<00:05:43.639> would<00:05:43.880> be<00:05:44.090> like<00:05:45.700> really<00:05:46.700> cool

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
think it would be like really cool

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.550 
think it would be like really cool
because<00:05:47.270> I<00:05:47.539> haven't<00:05:47.840> seen<00:05:48.050> daedric<00:05:48.440> armor

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
because I haven't seen daedric armor

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:55.930 
because I haven't seen daedric armor
done<00:05:48.919> yet<00:05:49.100> and<00:05:51.340> that<00:05:52.340> is<00:05:53.289> crack<00:05:54.520> it<00:05:55.520> could<00:05:55.760> be

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:55.940 
done yet and that is crack it could be

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:01.960 
done yet and that is crack it could be
it<00:05:56.210> it<00:05:56.660> I<00:05:58.180> think<00:05:59.180> so<00:06:00.050> I<00:06:00.380> can<00:06:00.710> I<00:06:00.950> could<00:06:01.820> probably

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:01.970 
it it I think so I can I could probably

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.350 
it it I think so I can I could probably
cover<00:06:02.300> one<00:06:02.750> other<00:06:02.900> thing<00:06:03.260> oh<00:06:03.500> yeah<00:06:04.430> if<00:06:05.210> you

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.440 
cover one other thing oh yeah if you
want<00:06:05.510> to<00:06:05.600> make<00:06:06.039> cheap<00:06:07.360> customs<00:06:08.680> keep<00:06:09.680> all<00:06:09.950> your

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:22.850 
it I I was gonna say is use the paint

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:28.900 
it I I was gonna say is use the paint
and<00:07:23.440> make<00:07:24.490> clay<00:07:25.490> and<00:07:26.470> then<00:07:27.470> trace<00:07:28.130> the<00:07:28.160> outside

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:28.910 
and make clay and then trace the outside

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:30.970 
and make clay and then trace the outside
with<00:07:29.300> the<00:07:29.330> all-purpose<00:07:29.990> label<00:07:30.560> so<00:07:30.710> you<00:07:30.830> get

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:30.980 
with the all-purpose label so you get

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.730 
with the all-purpose label so you get
straight<00:07:31.340> edges<00:07:31.760> and<00:07:31.910> stuff<00:07:32.210> and<00:07:32.530> then<00:07:33.530> just

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:33.740 
straight edges and stuff and then just

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:35.590 
straight edges and stuff and then just
peel<00:07:33.980> off<00:07:34.040> the<00:07:34.550> all-purpose<00:07:34.940> label<00:07:35.450> that's

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:35.600 
peel off the all-purpose label that's

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:43.380 
peel off the all-purpose label that's
what<00:07:35.750> I<00:07:35.840> do<00:07:36.700> and<00:07:40.240> that'll<00:07:41.240> be<00:07:41.390> it<00:07:41.660> until

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:43.390 
what I do and that'll be it until

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:46.450 
what I do and that'll be it until
probably<00:07:44.390> a<00:07:44.870> couple<00:07:45.230> of<00:07:45.500> days<00:07:45.740> I<00:07:45.770> might<00:07:46.220> make<00:07:46.430> a

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:46.460 
probably a couple of days I might make a

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:57.469 
probably a couple of days I might make a
couple<00:07:46.790> more<00:07:47.120> tomorrow<00:07:47.600> so<00:07:50.410> yeah
