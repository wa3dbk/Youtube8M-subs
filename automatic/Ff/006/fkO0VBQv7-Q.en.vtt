comes<00:00:12.990> around

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:48.970 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.160 

so<00:00:49.540> that's<00:00:49.900> one<00:00:50.140> plant<00:00:51.600> these<00:00:52.600> might<00:00:52.900> be<00:00:53.080> as

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
so that's one plant these might be as

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.710 
so that's one plant these might be as
much<00:00:53.410> as<00:00:53.590> ten<00:00:53.830> years<00:00:54.070> old<00:00:54.340> actually<00:00:55.030> in<00:00:56.020> Japan

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:57.720 
much as ten years old actually in Japan

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.700 
much as ten years old actually in Japan
they<00:00:58.720> do<00:00:58.780> not<00:00:59.050> grow<00:00:59.230> Mesabi<00:00:59.710> come<00:01:00.010> see<00:01:01.710> it's

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
they do not grow Mesabi come see it's

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.000 
they do not grow Mesabi come see it's
all<00:01:02.920> tissue<00:01:03.220> culture<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:05.619> what<00:01:05.800> they've<00:01:05.979> done

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
all tissue culture and what they've done

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.670 
all tissue culture and what they've done
is<00:01:06.310> selected<00:01:07.619> for<00:01:08.619> tap<00:01:08.890> rootedness<00:01:10.530> it's<00:01:11.530> the

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
is selected for tap rootedness it's the

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.900 
is selected for tap rootedness it's the
same<00:01:11.890> with<00:01:13.650> say<00:01:14.650> burdock<00:01:15.130> if<00:01:15.400> you<00:01:15.490> grow<00:01:15.670> wild

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:15.910 
same with say burdock if you grow wild

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.150 
same with say burdock if you grow wild
burdock<00:01:16.420> the<00:01:16.660> really<00:01:16.900> roots<00:01:17.290> just<00:01:17.560> are<00:01:17.950> kind

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
burdock the really roots just are kind

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.450 
burdock the really roots just are kind
of<00:01:18.220> fibrous<00:01:18.700> and<00:01:18.880> go<00:01:19.030> all<00:01:19.180> over<00:01:19.210> the<00:01:19.450> place<00:01:20.460> so

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
of fibrous and go all over the place so

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.510 
of fibrous and go all over the place so
they've<00:01:21.640> selected<00:01:21.880> for<00:01:23.130> tap<00:01:24.130> rooted

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
they've selected for tap rooted

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.170 
they've selected for tap rooted
varieties<00:01:25.060> in<00:01:25.690> Japan<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:27.460> in<00:01:27.610> Japan<00:01:27.970> the

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
varieties in Japan and in Japan the

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.670 
varieties in Japan and in Japan the
clones<00:01:28.479> are<00:01:28.840> like<00:01:29.110> specific<00:01:29.920> to<00:01:31.229> local<00:01:32.229> areas

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
clones are like specific to local areas

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.730 
clones are like specific to local areas
so<00:01:33.280> in<00:01:34.149> one<00:01:34.360> Valley<00:01:34.660> they'll<00:01:35.110> be<00:01:35.229> growing<00:01:35.470> one

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
so in one Valley they'll be growing one

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.710 
so in one Valley they'll be growing one
clone<00:01:36.070> in<00:01:36.340> the<00:01:36.490> next<00:01:36.700> Valley<00:01:36.880> over<00:01:37.119> they'll<00:01:37.600> be

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
clone in the next Valley over they'll be

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.609 
clone in the next Valley over they'll be
growing<00:01:37.899> a<00:01:38.080> different<00:01:38.440> one<00:01:40.289> these<00:01:41.289> don't<00:01:41.530> have

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
growing a different one these don't have

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.040 
growing a different one these don't have
a<00:01:41.740> very<00:01:42.130> big<00:01:42.369> riser

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
a very big riser

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.850 
a very big riser
they're<00:01:44.050> mainly<00:01:44.259> just<00:01:44.530> fiber<00:01:44.860> rooted<00:01:46.680> this<00:01:47.680> is

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
they're mainly just fiber rooted this is

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.620 
they're mainly just fiber rooted this is
the<00:01:48.009> part<00:01:48.250> that<00:01:48.460> they<00:01:48.640> typically<00:01:49.119> want<00:01:49.390> to<00:01:49.479> eat

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
the part that they typically want to eat

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.710 
the part that they typically want to eat
but<00:01:49.899> in<00:01:50.020> Japan<00:01:50.410> that<00:01:50.440> part<00:01:51.070> right<00:01:51.250> there<00:01:51.720> and

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
but in Japan that part right there and

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.900 
but in Japan that part right there and
it<00:01:52.869> was<00:01:52.990> like<00:01:53.200> six<00:01:53.649> inches<00:01:54.039> long<00:01:54.340> and<00:01:54.729> an<00:01:54.819> inch

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910 
it was like six inches long and an inch

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.430 
it was like six inches long and an inch
and<00:01:55.179> a<00:01:55.209> half<00:01:55.240> in<00:01:55.569> diameter<00:01:55.750> from<00:01:56.289> the

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
and a half in diameter from the

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.020 
and a half in diameter from the
photographs<00:01:57.039> I've<00:01:57.190> seen<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.990> alternative<00:01:59.560> is

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
photographs I've seen the alternative is

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.580 
photographs I've seen the alternative is
forget<00:02:01.030> about<00:02:01.149> the<00:02:01.390> rhizome<00:02:01.840> and<00:02:02.140> grow<00:02:02.349> it<00:02:02.500> as

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
forget about the rhizome and grow it as

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.029 
forget about the rhizome and grow it as
a<00:02:02.619> leaf<00:02:02.890> crop<00:02:03.250> I<00:02:03.580> think<00:02:04.450> there's<00:02:04.630> a<00:02:04.750> very<00:02:05.709> big

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
a leaf crop I think there's a very big

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:09.270 
a leaf crop I think there's a very big
market<00:02:06.280> for<00:02:06.640> the<00:02:06.759> weeds<00:02:07.920> nobody's<00:02:08.920> ever<00:02:09.069> heard

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
market for the weeds nobody's ever heard

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.919 
market for the weeds nobody's ever heard
of<00:02:09.429> them<00:02:09.580> in<00:02:09.700> America<00:02:10.119> before<00:02:10.539> so<00:02:10.840> it's

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
of them in America before so it's

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.540 
of them in America before so it's
something<00:02:11.110> new<00:02:11.440> for<00:02:11.470> the<00:02:11.830> chef's<00:02:12.130> to<00:02:12.340> play

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
something new for the chef's to play

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.850 
something new for the chef's to play
around<00:02:12.819> with<00:02:13.080> there's<00:02:14.080> a<00:02:14.170> million<00:02:14.349> things<00:02:14.560> you

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
around with there's a million things you

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.260 
around with there's a million things you
could<00:02:15.010> do<00:02:15.099> with<00:02:15.250> it<00:02:15.280> you<00:02:15.459> could<00:02:15.610> put<00:02:16.030> a<00:02:16.060> big

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
could do with it you could put a big

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.820 
could do with it you could put a big
leaf<00:02:16.510> right<00:02:16.780> out<00:02:16.930> into<00:02:17.050> a<00:02:17.170> hamburger<00:02:17.500> or

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
leaf right out into a hamburger or

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.339 
leaf right out into a hamburger or
something<00:02:18.300> for<00:02:19.300> starters<00:02:19.720> I<00:02:19.989> think<00:02:20.230> they

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
something for starters I think they

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:25.080 
something for starters I think they
might<00:02:23.010> incorporate<00:02:24.010> it<00:02:24.340> into<00:02:24.489> salad

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
might incorporate it into salad

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.000 
might incorporate it into salad
dressings<00:02:25.630> you<00:02:26.080> know<00:02:26.200> you<00:02:26.290> can<00:02:26.470> chop<00:02:26.709> it<00:02:26.739> up

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
dressings you know you can chop it up

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.059 
dressings you know you can chop it up
because<00:02:27.220> blender<00:02:27.959> you<00:02:28.959> could<00:02:29.080> even<00:02:29.260> perhaps<00:02:29.860> a

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
because blender you could even perhaps a

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.660 
because blender you could even perhaps a
rollup<00:02:30.250> sushi<00:02:30.819> and<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.090> bigger<00:02:31.239> leaves<00:02:32.670> use

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
rollup sushi and the bigger leaves use

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.220 
rollup sushi and the bigger leaves use
them<00:02:33.880> instead<00:02:34.209> of<00:02:34.270> the<00:02:34.450> seaweed

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
them instead of the seaweed

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.150 
them instead of the seaweed
I<00:02:36.180> think<00:02:37.180> inventive<00:02:38.140> chef<00:02:38.170> could<00:02:38.680> find<00:02:38.920> many

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
I think inventive chef could find many

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:48.260 
I think inventive chef could find many
many<00:02:39.370> different<00:02:39.730> things<00:02:39.790> to<00:02:40.180> do<00:02:40.300> with<00:02:40.480> these

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.330
