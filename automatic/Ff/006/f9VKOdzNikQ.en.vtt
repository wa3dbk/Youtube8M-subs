00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:08.610
 In mode Hachi Marichi some points for uv 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:11.470
 Useful commands have been added 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:17.680
 First is the targeting tool 

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:18.700
 Mod is designed so that editing of uv does not change after all editing and investigators 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:24.430
 thanks to 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:29.750
 For example, if you try to manipulate Start and moving tools and rotary tool 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:33.800
 Launch and operate the move tool on the 3d viewport 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:40.129
 You can edit the position of the geometry 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:43.989
 operate on Fu say try to start the Move tool on the uv of the viewport 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.989
 It can be done 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:52.120
 Similarly, specify the target button as x on the 3d viewport 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:04.710
 If you move the polygon 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:11.700
 You can offset the geometry symmetrically about the x axis and also have uv viewports 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:19.190
 If you start the move tool on the above, the direction of whether the target option is also raised 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:19.190
 Can be operated symmetrically with respect to the or v direction 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.039
 For example 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:30.510
 Choose this 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:32.330
 If you move the target mode in the direction 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:37.750
 in this way 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:41.840
 Like the 3 d viewport on uv viewport 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:47.240
 It should now be able to move the 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:49.640
 However , this target mode in the version of the mode nanamiru 1st game 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:54.100
 This is off 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.100
 For example uv moved 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:08.979
 If you move it like this and you are no longer an object, return it to the object again 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:15.370
 I could not say 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:21.069
 From Mod Hachimaruichi the target by the command or the uv target is mounted 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:23.620
 Force to think of the uv that has been lost to the target state 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:27.460
 Is able to 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:32.270
 Click the uv target button 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:37.560
 In the case of here, for example, direction to say this 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:41.330
 When you click the ok button from minus to plus 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:46.350
 The state of uv on this side 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:52.410
 It is possible to copy to this side 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:54.770
 Also it is implemented because the ability to integrate uv map Revenge is also Modo Hachimaruichi 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.770
 Was 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:09.180
 Eh this model will be the Chample 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:12.670
 One this, but we differently uv is set for part of the whole body and the eyes it on the corner 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:17.310
 Can be put together in uv 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.310
 First make a new map 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:27.180
 After that a multiple choice of that map you want to integrate in a state in which select the map in the very first 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.450
 I will go 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.650
 Uv integration when everything is selected 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:38.900
 Just click on this button 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:44.840
 Multiple of uv maps have been combined into one in this 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:45.500
 The uv that I put together is only just put it together by default 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.960
 Because 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:54.740
 I have overlapped each other 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:57.740
 Want to relocate uv space er in vain with no place in this way overlapping uv 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:00.850
 The case is uv pack 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:06.730
 Please use this tool 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:09.540
 This uv pack tool is a tool that rearranges uv within the specified range 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.540
 It has become 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:18.520
 In this way, the uvs that were overlapping in the previous step are rearranged without overlapping 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.520
 Will be
