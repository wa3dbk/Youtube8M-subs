00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:03.750
 the cities of manaus at 22 years old 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.750
 for a year she worked full time at mac donald's said 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.339
 besides, we are well-known behind the scenes 

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:13.459
 the girl agrees to check hygiene in many ways to 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:16.459
 big signs and play for us the key as close 

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:21.029
 we accompany him hidden camera and visited a dozen restaurants 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.359
 Parisian 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:25.400
 in this one before even going in and manon already promise a hint 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.800
 mickaÃ«l toti from Auxerre land will face face to face with science and 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.150
 switch 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.320
 for the time being employees 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.630
 why did he do that on arrival 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.050
 not very interesting because they are behind 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.240
 this one is undermined by customers not being held vincent who is not 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.520
 visible remains 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.090
 as for the inner customers of young people quietly a few 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.910
 centimeters of an abandoned meal on the floor 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.910
 and on the bench 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.800
 on the stairs you walk on toilet paper 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.060
 competitors shenzhen the toilet paper drags this time right in the middle of 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.030
 the room 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.370
 and on the stairs 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.190
 crushed potatoes 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.820
 face crushed by the ground percent in the future a sandwich on the floor 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.490
 this defeat was 16 years old 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.360
 not the third child 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.300
 the room was visiting by customers in my opinion will see arriving at the 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.360
 retirement 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.280
 it is not held before the arcep of all 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.280
 I think even more pay 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.050
 poorly maintained restaurant rooms 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.220
 bins that overflow 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.610
 we found this type of problem in half of the fast foods 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.610
 visit with manon 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.380
 yet the big chains of fast-food kominik on the quality and 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.400
 hygiene in their restaurant 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.900
 on their website 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.630
 aiming make even an advertising argument 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.759
 when one then believes slogan food security would be one of 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.759
 priorities of its brands 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.380
 videos even show employees performing checks 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.890
 reassuring images for the consumer 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:15.409
 but what's really going on in his kitchens 

00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:18.749
 the health of the customers were threatened 

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:21.749
 the management methods of the big chains his talent in question 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.760
 holding in two weeks we have infiltrate the kitchens of several 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.139
 restaurants 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:32.139
 behind-the-scenes investigation of fast foods 

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:40.579
 his two young sons to reporters 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:42.549
 we will call them sabrina 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.349
 and lucie 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.769
 with their resume they will try to get hired 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.699
 sabrina at kfc 

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:53.169
 lucide at mac donald's 

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:56.159
 however, it is of little interest that reports 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:58.719
 everything seems to succeed your suggestions 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:02.229
 recruiters do not take the time to read these lines a week 

00:03:02.779 --> 00:03:05.779
 the sncf 

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:10.279
 no matter the experience 

00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:13.279
 if only time flexibility seems decisive 

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:24.919
 lacazette did last night at m 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:27.919
 belga 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:30.900

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.809
 lucie and already summoned to a restaurant 

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:37.179
 after a short interview she is invited to take a test 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.569
 the boss 

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:47.509
 three other candidates in their twenties are already there 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:14.509
 a cartoon expo in a simplistic way the rules of the restaurant 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:18.970
 security products but also they come everything is reviewed 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:23.089
 to verify that candidates understand the explanations of the 

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:24.449
 little character 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:27.449
 they must answer a multiple choice questionnaire 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.009
 at the end of the test 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:41.630
 uci did ten hours the other candidates were not more 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:42.620
 bright 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.960
 but everyone is committed to a salary of 9 euros gross per hour 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:50.059
 the theoretical training on food hygiene is complete 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:53.569
 lucie starts tomorrow 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.550
 at 11 am in the restaurant's cloakroom 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.080
 lucie-angel uniform provided by mac donald's 

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:06.360
 obligatory passage the pointer one direction the parts 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.319
 his workstation 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:12.319
 the uci is greeted a little curtly by the director 

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:18.110
 Damascus - valery larbaud jean-louis garcia 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.719
 the agreement will 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:23.029
 the director is not more friendly with the employee responsible for accompanying 

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:26.029
 lucie this first day the fire extinguisher 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:32.099
 the almost noon customers in a hurry abound 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.080
 the uci must quickly take the pace 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:40.339
 she must type the orders on her cashier 

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:43.339
 to fill the glasses and catch the 100 minutes on the display 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.730
 not to mention the french fries that must be cooked and served hot 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.400
 are you going to party together 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:57.419
 still excellent it will go through 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:00.969
 for five hours the stress is permanent the maximum pressure 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.419
 this one serves dozens of customers the chain 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:09.690
 for each of them she must take the order in 30 seconds under penalty 

00:06:09.689 --> 00:06:11.689
 to be spotted by a manager 

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:13.669
 3 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:16.669
 I will do what I want 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:19.830
 employees went on strike 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.830
 federer went on strike at the SNCF and rff 

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:27.129
 he observed 

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:30.610
 at the same time 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:34.630
 for five hours later he will admit no break even not a few seconds 

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:36.369
 to blow 

00:06:36.369 --> 00:06:39.369
 to see a simple glass of water at douai to ask permission 

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:57.519
 there are a few less people at the checkouts but here it is not necessary to remain inactive 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.150
 the manager said + he's dealing a little bit of housekeeping 

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:06.270
 broom in the kitchen 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:09.270
 then clean the toilet 

00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:12.729
 she must also empty the trash 

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:15.889
 soon the uci is responsible for preparing French fries 

00:07:17.059 --> 00:07:20.399
 at no time does a manager require lucid she wash her hands 

00:07:21.659 --> 00:07:24.659
 yet the teacher claims to be intransigent on the issue 

00:07:26.849 --> 00:07:31.000
 on his website mcdonald's makes hand washing a real ritual 

00:07:32.849 --> 00:07:36.309
 as soon as they arrive at the restaurant, team members wash their hands and 

00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:39.309
 forearm with bactericidal soap 30 seconds minimum 

00:07:40.419 --> 00:07:43.419
 he renews the washing at least every hour 

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:49.000
 the adage every hour this one is surprised nothing anymore nor anyone here 

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
 forced him to abide by this rule could reach this year 

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.520
 the smell mistake 

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:02.599
 and the lfp 

00:08:02.599 --> 00:08:06.319
 jeremy work for another big sign for him there is a real 

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:07.919
 shift between the present image
