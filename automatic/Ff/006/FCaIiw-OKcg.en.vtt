00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.090
 hello to all the boys and propellers 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:27.960
 welcome to my unboxing then 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:32.370
 we are here with my brand new keyboard 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:36.489
 ladakhi shine 3 this keyboard is 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:39.070
 completely mechanical but without losing 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:45.360
 time we go right away in fact ad 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:50.379
 open it and savor its appearance 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:53.920
 so here it is a real one 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:59.649
 wonder but that stuff 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:02.610
 then we remove the plastic and admire 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:02.610
 the most closely 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.280
 here it is 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:15.010
 that of true certain wonder 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:18.880
 it is not has nothing like the keyboards of 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:21.460
 other brands that in short all full 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:25.750
 of colors screens etcetera etc. no 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:28.150
 this instead and from the very expert 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:33.990
 simple but they did not spare 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.990
 minimally in product quality 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:43.890
 let's go and see what else we have 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:49.030
 here then we have books 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:51.910
 booklet with instructions in language 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.740
 I don't know Korean , though 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.649
 wait then let's see here not rich 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.490
 here is something more 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.729
 understandable 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:04.119
 then we should the guarantee be 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.140
 but here too everything is a village language 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.899
 it is not clear 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.119
 oh well then let's go see some 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:13.890
 so what we have as accessories 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:18.180
 let's see if we have the usb cable 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.180
 hands slipping a usb cable 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:30.299
 then we have this here serves to pull you 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:30.299
 to the keyboard keys 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.510
 then we have a space bar of 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.240
 change if we change 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:48.720
 the current one and finally we have gods 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:51.240
 wasd keys in case we wanted to change them 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.740
 put these reds on or give me now 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.870
 a moment the time the system is on 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:03:00.450
 all and then I'll show you a little 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:02.580
 keyboard in function guys then how 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.370
 you know this keyboard or maybe you don't 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.020
 you know anyway this keyboard is 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.750
 completely backlit though 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.200
 now backlighting 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:16.050
 off but backlighting ea 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.780
 let's say various options this evening 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:21.450
 backlight and now I will make you 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:25.800
 see a couple of these options 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:29.470
 therefore the first is this you see 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:34.970
 they just lit up by sting 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:36.819
 then there is the second one that illuminates i 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.999
 keys 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:43.139
 directional in short and then we see a little 

00:03:39.999 --> 00:03:43.139
 we also have 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.569
 let's see what this splinter a 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:53.950
 key not such as this union 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:55.959
 function and therefore not ok so so 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.569
 we have the keyboard completely 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:01.950
 illuminated we can adjust the 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:01.950
 brightness so 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:08.069
 very strong on the weak 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.530
 ok then let's see some more 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.880
 options 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:21.540
 let's see this here is pretty much it 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:24.930
 maybe he thinks it looks as good as it does now 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:28.080
 and I'll show you practically the 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:31.380
 brightness goes and comes and then rises and 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:38.700
 it lowers we can change the speed 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:44.510
 where this happens you see ok then 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:44.510
 we have another way this 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:52.770
 it's a bit if I can change it I can 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.770
 slow it down 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:01.870
 practically a kind of honda 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:05.900
 which runs from left to right 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:09.590
 then we see another ok this way 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:13.130
 snake mode is like snake 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:18.700
 there was in the old nokia phones we can 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:18.700
 increase the speed of the snake 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:27.950
 we can lower it then we see a little 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:33.130
 another mode of the back 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:36.140
 customer lighting always question 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:39.830
 nothing special as a mode 

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:44.600
 let's see this here and create type 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:52.120
 monde that expands Venetian of you that 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:54.440
 tito write she knows that cool stuff 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.810
 then let's see if we give up another one 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:01.850
 I know how many are I approve of 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:04.280
 movilli let's see this and create 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.590
 in short, lighting in the only one 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:15.890
 line in which we are going to press the 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:17.270
 key and see if there is another one in 

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:19.810
 theories there should be another one 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:22.490
 only I still haven't understood how 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:24.890
 activating it should be another one 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:27.890
 of modality that allows us to 

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:29.270
 select which key interests us 

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.670
 illuminate and which not 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:34.070
 as I know you put the case you play ad 

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:37.040
 a game where you are interested in the keys 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:39.230
 wasat and you are interested in other keys 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:42.160
 details you can light them only 

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:45.770
 that at the moment I don't know how to do it 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:50.030
 so we are a bit squashed 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:52.310
 another key we hope this a bit with 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:56.360
 this is only going to turn off and on 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:59.990
 these keys here so nothing else 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:04.790
 particular keys 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:04.790
 at the moment it is not one 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:17.250
 okay i would say kids for that 

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:19.140
 unboxing is everything I have nothing else to do with you 

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:22.440
 see apart from that mode there that 

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:28.010
 but I don't know how to activate it then I have to 

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:29.400
 to study the booklet well in short 

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:32.520
 anything 

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:36.990
 so guys hope this is mine 

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:40.500
 unboxing let's say so there is amateur 

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:44.220
 liked it is nothing special I know 

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:47.700
 but I like a bit in short I like it 

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:51.650
 in short, visiting is fine 

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:54.850
