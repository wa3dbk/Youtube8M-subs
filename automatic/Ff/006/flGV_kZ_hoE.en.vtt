00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.050
 finish 

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.050
 at last 

00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:11.249
 finish 

00:00:12.399 --> 00:00:14.699
 at last 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:16.669
 finish 

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:18.609
 discontent end 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:23.189
 continued in the month of September we discovered a new attempt 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.920
 in the world of soccer 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.120
 and is that after seeing Cristiano Ronaldo throw that foul against the 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.430
 zÃºrich in the first European day of this course we affirmed with forcefulness 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:40.200
 that everything is not yet invented in the world of sports king a point 1 this 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.860
 against Marseille's olympique he repeated it again in the corner 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.770
 Mandanda knew here he had in front and placed the barrier but the 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.340
 Portuguese did not intend to fail hit the ball in its lower left and 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.090
 almost at the speed of light, esne described an unattainable parabola 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.090
 for the constant goalie 2 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.660
 two points 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.340
 Cristiano Ronaldo has his own ability to throw absences is the product of 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.220
 many hours of work and study of their releases well deserve a treaty 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.580
 a technical manual center 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.100
 of how to position the body the way it approaches the ball and the 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.590
 position of the legs in the shot with the knee always ahead of the 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.830
 foot when it contacts the ball 2 those are the main weapons and with a 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.300
 perfect combination of them the Portuguese crack is able to get 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.010
 indescribable goals and narrate them magical as the one that marked him this 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.390
 Sunday at villarreal 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.550
 so I enjoyed it one more time because I still see the hundreds of times 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.450
 they will be unable to articulate a word because the trajectory that describes the 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.860
 football stays flat in the air and descends at the last moment to 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.060
 sneak through the square wonder to the genius of the lamp 1
