00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
control of their bikes it's amazing once

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.319 
control of their bikes it's amazing once
you<00:00:34.950> understand<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.460> actual<00:00:35.640> technology<00:00:36.059> is

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
you understand the actual technology is

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.119 
you understand the actual technology is
steering<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.690> bike<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.320> totally<00:00:37.680> changes<00:00:37.980> are

writing<00:00:38.399> yeah<00:00:39.329> completely<00:00:40.140> changed<00:00:40.590> I

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
writing yeah completely changed I

writing yeah completely changed I
feeling<00:00:42.000> control<00:00:42.270> steering<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.719> bike<00:00:42.899> now

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
feeling control steering the bike now

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.220 
feeling control steering the bike now
I'm<00:00:44.370> not<00:00:44.550> quick<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.850> turning<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.510> know<00:00:45.780> when<00:00:46.079> and

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
I'm not quick to turning I know when and

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.979 
I'm not quick to turning I know when and
where<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.410> need<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.770> lean<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.750> it's<00:00:48.750> like<00:00:48.809> I'm

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
where I need to lean it it's like I'm

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.569 
where I need to lean it it's like I'm
seeing<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.410> turns<00:00:49.649> completely<00:00:49.829> different

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
seeing the turns completely different

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.660 
seeing the turns completely different
now<00:00:50.700> my<00:00:51.690> sr<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.230> way<00:00:52.530> quieter<00:00:53.010> it's<00:00:53.399> so

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
now my sr is a way quieter it's so

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.569 
now my sr is a way quieter it's so
simple

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
simple

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.160 
simple
yeah<00:00:56.269> once<00:00:56.719> you<00:00:56.839> understand<00:00:57.289> it<00:00:58.659> in<00:00:59.659> double

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
yeah once you understand it in double

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.349 
yeah once you understand it in double
apex<00:01:00.440> terms<00:01:00.829> like<00:01:01.100> this<00:01:01.370> one<00:01:01.579> things<00:01:02.120> can

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
apex terms like this one things can

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:04.780 
apex terms like this one things can
sometimes<00:01:02.570> feel<00:01:03.140> a<00:01:03.199> little<00:01:03.499> busy<00:01:04.070> trying<00:01:04.670> to

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
sometimes feel a little busy trying to

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.609 
sometimes feel a little busy trying to
maintain<00:01:04.939> a<00:01:05.149> continuous<00:01:05.449> throttle<00:01:06.229> role<00:01:06.409> on

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
maintain a continuous throttle role on

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:08.710 
maintain a continuous throttle role on
only<00:01:07.040> runs<00:01:07.490> you<00:01:07.670> I'd<00:01:07.850> because<00:01:08.450> it's<00:01:08.600> really

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
only runs you I'd because it's really

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.600 
only runs you I'd because it's really
two<00:01:09.049> turns<00:01:09.549> but<00:01:10.549> the<00:01:10.640> rider<00:01:10.909> has<00:01:11.240> more<00:01:11.570> choices

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
two turns but the rider has more choices

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.770 
two turns but the rider has more choices
just<00:01:13.610> roll<00:01:13.820> the<00:01:13.939> gas<00:01:14.119> on<00:01:14.240> a<00:01:14.299> little<00:01:14.570> bit<00:01:14.689> and

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
just roll the gas on a little bit and

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.350 
just roll the gas on a little bit and
hold<00:01:15.020> in<00:01:15.170> there<00:01:15.380> not<00:01:16.369> horrible<00:01:16.759> but<00:01:16.970> not

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
hold in there not horrible but not

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.399 
hold in there not horrible but not
really<00:01:17.539> stable<00:01:18.140> either

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:22.889 

get<00:01:21.070> on<00:01:21.189> the<00:01:21.340> gas<00:01:21.490> and<00:01:21.909> then<00:01:22.090> off<00:01:22.210> to<00:01:22.600> turn<00:01:22.780> it

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
get on the gas and then off to turn it

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:24.330 
get on the gas and then off to turn it
for<00:01:22.990> the<00:01:23.079> second<00:01:23.380> part<00:01:23.530> of<00:01:23.619> the<00:01:23.710> term<00:01:23.920> then

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
for the second part of the term then

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.330 
for the second part of the term then
back<00:01:24.549> to<00:01:24.700> the<00:01:24.729> gas<00:01:25.439> but<00:01:26.439> that<00:01:26.590> only<00:01:26.770> chops<00:01:27.159> it

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
back to the gas but that only chops it

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.849 
back to the gas but that only chops it
up<00:01:27.429> doesn't<00:01:27.819> it<00:01:27.999> he<00:01:28.869> could<00:01:29.109> go<00:01:29.319> in<00:01:29.469> hard<00:01:29.679> and

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:29.859 
up doesn't it he could go in hard and

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:31.950 
up doesn't it he could go in hard and
break<00:01:30.039> a<00:01:30.069> bit<00:01:30.369> then<00:01:30.969> on<00:01:31.090> the<00:01:31.210> gas<00:01:31.359> again<00:01:31.630> that

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
break a bit then on the gas again that

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.840 
break a bit then on the gas again that
could<00:01:32.140> work<00:01:32.319> we<00:01:32.799> had<00:01:32.920> better<00:01:33.219> be<00:01:33.429> super<00:01:34.000> smooth

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
could work we had better be super smooth

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.099 
could work we had better be super smooth
okay<00:01:36.850> how<00:01:37.209> do<00:01:37.270> we<00:01:37.689> do<00:01:38.109> it<00:01:38.670> timing<00:01:39.670> is<00:01:39.729> critical

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:40.109 
okay how do we do it timing is critical

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:42.410 
okay how do we do it timing is critical
getting<00:01:41.109> back<00:01:41.289> into<00:01:41.439> the<00:01:41.619> throttle<00:01:41.920> early

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
getting back into the throttle early

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.179 
getting back into the throttle early
stabilizes<00:01:43.420> the<00:01:43.450> bike<00:01:43.750> then<00:01:44.289> mid<00:01:44.920> corner

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
stabilizes the bike then mid corner

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:47.760 
stabilizes the bike then mid corner

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
instead of rolling it off he just stops

rolling on here is where your body

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.380 
rolling on here is where your body
position<00:01:50.259> comes<00:01:51.039> into<00:01:51.340> play<00:01:51.549> in<00:01:51.789> a<00:01:51.909> big<00:01:52.209> way

is<00:02:07.090> down<00:02:07.360> into<00:02:07.659> the<00:02:07.810> inside<00:02:08.170> body<00:02:08.590> position

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:25.290 

here<00:02:14.910> we<00:02:15.239> see<00:02:15.420> an<00:02:15.540> average<00:02:16.080> hang<00:02:16.380> off<00:02:16.530> position

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.130 

here<00:02:25.810> is<00:02:25.900> a<00:02:25.930> more<00:02:26.170> aggressive<00:02:26.470> body<00:02:26.920> position

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
here is a more aggressive body position

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:37.280 
here is a more aggressive body position
notice<00:02:29.140> he's<00:02:29.560> able<00:02:29.800> to<00:02:30.010> hold<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:30.400> title<00:02:30.610> line

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.750 

now<00:02:38.290> that's<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.680> hood<00:02:38.830> turn<00:02:39.070> technique<00:02:39.520> and

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
now that's the hood turn technique and

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.640 
now that's the hood turn technique and
can<00:02:40.240> work<00:02:40.420> in<00:02:40.570> almost<00:02:40.750> any<00:02:41.140> cornering

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
can work in almost any cornering

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.120 
can work in almost any cornering
situation

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
situation

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.460 
situation
on<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.970> road<00:02:45.150> this<00:02:45.660> technique<00:02:46.140> can<00:02:46.170> be<00:02:46.380> used

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
on the road this technique can be used

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.410 
on the road this technique can be used
quite<00:02:46.980> effectively<00:02:47.160> if<00:02:47.910> you<00:02:48.090> find<00:02:48.300> yourself

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
quite effectively if you find yourself

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.810 
quite effectively if you find yourself
running<00:02:48.840> wide<00:02:49.230> and<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:49.500> turn<00:02:49.770> dropping<00:02:50.670> to<00:02:50.760> the

in<00:05:25.140> without<00:05:25.680> turning<00:05:26.010> in<00:05:26.340> is<00:05:26.520> how<00:05:26.880> we<00:05:26.940> overcome

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
in without turning in is how we overcome

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.170 
in without turning in is how we overcome
this<00:05:27.690> sr<00:05:28.169> we<00:05:28.680> call<00:05:28.890> it<00:05:29.040> the<00:05:29.250> two-step

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
this sr we call it the two-step

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:39.050 
this sr we call it the two-step
technique<00:05:36.590> it's<00:05:37.590> also<00:05:37.830> the<00:05:38.160> key<00:05:38.340> to<00:05:38.550> finding<00:05:38.940> a

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
technique it's also the key to finding a

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.090 
technique it's also the key to finding a
line<00:05:39.300> that<00:05:39.510> doesn't<00:05:40.020> take<00:05:40.200> you<00:05:40.380> into<00:05:40.560> early

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
line that doesn't take you into early

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.270 
line that doesn't take you into early
even<00:05:41.910> on<00:05:42.060> unfamiliar<00:05:42.690> roads<00:05:42.990> your<00:05:43.830> first<00:05:44.160> step

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
even on unfamiliar roads your first step

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.190 
even on unfamiliar roads your first step
is<00:05:44.640> to<00:05:44.700> estimate<00:05:44.940> a<00:05:45.270> turning<00:05:45.690> point<00:05:45.720> on<00:05:46.110> the

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.200 
is to estimate a turning point on the

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.980 
is to estimate a turning point on the
road<00:05:46.380> ahead<00:05:46.530> you<00:05:47.520> don't<00:05:47.790> know<00:05:48.060> the<00:05:48.240> road<00:05:48.419> so

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
road ahead you don't know the road so

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.600 
road ahead you don't know the road so
you're<00:05:49.110> just<00:05:49.290> establishing<00:05:49.890> a<00:05:50.070> temporary

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
you're just establishing a temporary

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.360 
you're just establishing a temporary
reference<00:05:51.150> point<00:05:51.450> step<00:05:52.020> two<00:05:52.229> is<00:05:52.470> find<00:05:53.220> your

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
reference point step two is find your

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.430 
reference point step two is find your
mid<00:05:53.580> corner<00:05:53.820> position<00:05:54.030> where<00:05:54.720> you<00:05:55.050> clip<00:05:55.410> the

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
mid corner position where you clip the

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.400 
mid corner position where you clip the
inside<00:05:55.950> of<00:05:55.979> the<00:05:56.160> turn<00:05:56.370> is<00:05:56.580> your<00:05:57.150> apex<00:05:57.720> the

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.410 
inside of the turn is your apex the

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.230 
inside of the turn is your apex the
trick<00:05:58.620> here<00:05:58.800> is<00:05:58.860> looking<00:05:59.370> in<00:05:59.520> to<00:05:59.790> find<00:06:00.060> it

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
trick here is looking in to find it

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.180 
trick here is looking in to find it
without<00:06:00.360> turning<00:06:00.810> the<00:06:00.990> bike<00:06:01.260> in<00:06:01.500> at<00:06:01.800> the<00:06:01.979> same

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
without turning the bike in at the same

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.940 
without turning the bike in at the same
time<00:06:02.550> now<00:06:03.270> he<00:06:03.330> looks<00:06:03.570> in<00:06:03.840> but<00:06:04.440> notice<00:06:04.770> how<00:06:04.800> he

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:04.950 
time now he looks in but notice how he

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.030 
time now he looks in but notice how he
is<00:06:05.100> staying<00:06:05.460> wide<00:06:05.760> in<00:06:05.940> the<00:06:06.060> corner<00:06:06.450> now<00:06:07.380> would

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.040 
is staying wide in the corner now would

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.469 
is staying wide in the corner now would
you<00:06:08.190> be<00:06:08.340> able<00:06:08.490> to<00:06:08.700> see<00:06:08.880> a<00:06:08.910> line<00:06:09.150> from<00:06:09.330> this

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.479 
you be able to see a line from this

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:12.590 
you be able to see a line from this
position<00:06:09.690> no<00:06:10.640> keep<00:06:11.640> looking<00:06:11.940> but<00:06:12.210> don't<00:06:12.390> turn

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:12.600 
position no keep looking but don't turn

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.680 
position no keep looking but don't turn
yet<00:06:12.840> how<00:06:13.680> about<00:06:13.890> from<00:06:14.040> here<00:06:14.220> not<00:06:15.120> yet<00:06:15.330> but<00:06:15.540> it's

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:15.690 
yet how about from here not yet but it's

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:18.620 
yet how about from here not yet but it's
getting<00:06:15.810> better<00:06:16.370> okay<00:06:17.370> now<00:06:17.940> you<00:06:18.000> can<00:06:18.150> see<00:06:18.479> your

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:18.630 
getting better okay now you can see your

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:21.560 
getting better okay now you can see your
apex<00:06:18.960> clearly<00:06:19.550> that's<00:06:20.550> exactly<00:06:21.180> where<00:06:21.419> you're

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:21.570 
apex clearly that's exactly where you're

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:23.659 
apex clearly that's exactly where you're
turning<00:06:21.990> point<00:06:22.229> should<00:06:22.440> be<00:06:22.650> nothing<00:06:23.220> provides

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:23.669 
turning point should be nothing provides
