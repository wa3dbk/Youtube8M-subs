it's a 4-speed first gears low gear and

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.150 
it's a 4-speed first gears low gear and
these<00:00:56.789> are<00:00:56.940> just<00:00:57.090> normal<00:00:57.300> running<00:00:57.660> gears

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
these are just normal running gears

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.240 
these are just normal running gears
reversed<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.340> everything<00:00:59.670> and<00:01:00.559> it<00:01:01.559> uses<00:01:01.980> our

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
reversed and everything and it uses our

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.649 
reversed and everything and it uses our

see<00:01:06.659> it's<00:01:06.840> got<00:01:06.990> drive<00:01:07.290> shaft<00:01:07.530> here<00:01:07.890> right<00:01:08.610> from

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
see it's got drive shaft here right from

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.899 
see it's got drive shaft here right from
the<00:01:08.970> engine<00:01:10.010> through<00:01:11.010> there<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:13.760> it's<00:01:14.760> an

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
the engine through there and it's an

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.539 
the engine through there and it's an
older<00:01:15.150> engine<00:01:15.270> so<00:01:15.600> it's<00:01:15.750> got<00:01:15.869> points<00:01:16.310> and<00:01:17.310> it's

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
older engine so it's got points and it's

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:18.499 
older engine so it's got points and it's
got<00:01:17.670> points<00:01:17.939> under<00:01:18.150> there

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
got points under there

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.249 
got points under there
it's<00:01:19.020> got<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.200> coil<00:01:20.000> this<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.270> this<00:01:21.900> is<00:01:21.990> probably

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
it's got a coil this is this is probably

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.380 
it's got a coil this is this is probably
one<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.590> strongest<00:01:23.220> built<00:01:23.490> lawn<00:01:24.180> mowers
