younger players and certainly the
midfield<00:01:46.409> players<00:01:46.649> will<00:01:46.829> benefit<00:01:47.220> from<00:01:47.250> from

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
midfield players will benefit from from

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.010 
midfield players will benefit from from
him<00:01:47.820> being<00:01:48.030> here<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.270> think<00:01:48.509> time<00:01:48.750> on<00:01:48.930> the

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
him being here I think time on the

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.240 
him being here I think time on the
strain<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.409> pitch<00:01:49.590> getting<00:01:49.890> used<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.159> each

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
strain and pitch getting used to each

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.420 
strain and pitch getting used to each
other<00:01:50.460> getting<00:01:51.240> used<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.680> to<00:01:52.680> Giannini<00:01:53.070> oh<00:01:53.189> and

other getting used to to Giannini oh and
all<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.549> other<00:01:53.759> players<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.149> I'm<00:01:54.240> gonna<00:01:54.329> be

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
all the other players that I'm gonna be

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.060 
all the other players that I'm gonna be
playing<00:01:54.630> with<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.380> know<00:01:55.470> they<00:01:55.619> need<00:01:55.829> time

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
playing with and you know they need time

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.770 
playing with and you know they need time
to<00:01:56.250> adjust

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
to adjust

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.420 
to adjust
back<00:01:56.960> to<00:01:57.140> me<00:01:57.350> but<00:01:57.920> I<00:01:57.950> don't<00:01:58.159> think<00:01:58.280> they'll

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
back to me but I don't think they'll

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.120 
back to me but I don't think they'll
take<00:01:58.640> too<00:01:58.820> long<00:01:59.350> you<00:02:00.350> know<00:02:00.470> already<00:02:00.770> were

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
take too long you know already were

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.430 
take too long you know already were
would<00:02:02.090> already<00:02:02.240> be<00:02:02.450> working<00:02:02.780> on<00:02:03.170> on

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
would already be working on on

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.200 
would already be working on on
partnerships<00:02:04.070> and<00:02:04.190> relationships<00:02:04.310> and<00:02:05.000> I

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
partnerships and relationships and I

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.820 
partnerships and relationships and I
believe<00:02:05.600> they'll<00:02:05.840> progress<00:02:06.049> and<00:02:06.440> become<00:02:06.530> very

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
believe they'll progress and become very

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.499 
believe they'll progress and become very
stronger<00:02:07.250> I<00:02:07.460> don't<00:02:07.820> think<00:02:07.880> we'll<00:02:08.090> change<00:02:08.360> a

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
stronger I don't think we'll change a

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.919 
stronger I don't think we'll change a
whole<00:02:08.660> lot

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
whole lot

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.980 
whole lot
obviously<00:02:09.500> Stephens<00:02:10.490> qualities<00:02:11.300> will<00:02:11.780> offer

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990 
obviously Stephens qualities will offer

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.040 
obviously Stephens qualities will offer
different<00:02:12.140> dimensions<00:02:12.890> to<00:02:13.040> our<00:02:13.130> team<00:02:13.370> but<00:02:14.050> on

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
different dimensions to our team but on

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.380 
different dimensions to our team but on
the<00:02:15.200> training<00:02:15.620> field<00:02:15.890> and<00:02:16.130> in<00:02:16.310> our<00:02:16.790> first

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
the training field and in our first

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.570 
the training field and in our first
couple<00:02:17.720> of<00:02:17.780> games<00:02:17.840> we'll<00:02:18.260> get<00:02:18.410> a<00:02:18.709> better<00:02:19.220> feel

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
couple of games we'll get a better feel

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.390 
couple of games we'll get a better feel
for<00:02:19.610> each<00:02:19.850> other<00:02:20.120> I<00:02:20.360> think<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:21.860> one<00:02:22.069> thing<00:02:22.250> is

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
for each other I think the one thing is

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.110 
for each other I think the one thing is
is<00:02:22.670> a<00:02:22.700> great<00:02:22.970> footballer<00:02:23.450> and<00:02:24.250> he<00:02:25.250> has<00:02:25.370> is<00:02:25.910> a

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
is a great footballer and he has is a

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.900 
is a great footballer and he has is a
very<00:02:26.569> good<00:02:26.810> working<00:02:27.400> understanding<00:02:28.400> of<00:02:28.489> our

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
very good working understanding of our

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.509 
very good working understanding of our
team<00:02:29.150> already<00:02:29.860> Steven<00:02:30.860> did<00:02:31.070> his<00:02:31.190> homework

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
team already Steven did his homework

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.699 
team already Steven did his homework
before<00:02:31.640> he<00:02:31.910> got<00:02:32.030> here<00:02:32.300> he<00:02:32.810> knows<00:02:33.170> our<00:02:33.380> players

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
before he got here he knows our players

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.680 
before he got here he knows our players
he<00:02:33.920> knows<00:02:34.100> what<00:02:34.280> they're<00:02:34.430> about<00:02:34.700> and<00:02:34.760> he's

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
he knows what they're about and he's

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.509 
he knows what they're about and he's
seen<00:02:35.930> some<00:02:36.170> games<00:02:36.350> and<00:02:36.739> I<00:02:36.980> think<00:02:37.459> the

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
seen some games and I think the

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.449 
seen some games and I think the
transition<00:02:38.120> will<00:02:38.480> be<00:02:38.600> a<00:02:38.630> smooth<00:02:38.989> one<00:02:39.230> and<00:02:39.459> as

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
transition will be a smooth one and as

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:41.710 
transition will be a smooth one and as
we<00:02:41.000> move<00:02:41.239> forward

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
we move forward

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.500 
we move forward
they'll<00:02:42.560> be<00:02:42.769> subtle<00:02:43.130> changes<00:02:43.580> but<00:02:43.819> I<00:02:44.030> don't

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
they'll be subtle changes but I don't

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:45.670 
they'll be subtle changes but I don't
think<00:02:44.630> things<00:02:44.810> will<00:02:44.989> change<00:02:45.050> change

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
think things will change change

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.590 
think things will change change
