gets the heat away from the core of this
you<00:01:07.830> know<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.310> actually<00:01:08.430> runs<00:01:08.790> cooler<00:01:09.420> than

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
you know it actually runs cooler than

gonna have you know maximum cooling and

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.539 
gonna have you know maximum cooling and
that<00:01:21.060> allows<00:01:21.420> them<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.810> over<00:01:22.200> clock<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.220> heck

and<00:03:03.989> the<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:05.580> memory<00:03:05.850> clock<00:03:06.000> is<00:03:06.209> at<00:03:06.360> 1.7

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
and the the memory clock is at 1.7

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.470 
and the the memory clock is at 1.7
gigahertz<00:03:07.920> that's<00:03:08.280> up<00:03:08.430> from<00:03:08.580> 1.4<00:03:09.209> on<00:03:09.360> the

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
gigahertz that's up from 1.4 on the

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.850 
gigahertz that's up from 1.4 on the
standard<00:03:09.810> model<00:03:10.019> so<00:03:10.410> this<00:03:10.530> thing<00:03:10.709> is

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
standard model so this thing is

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.070 
standard model so this thing is
overclocked<00:03:11.370> and<00:03:11.610> it's<00:03:12.360> also<00:03:12.540> like<00:03:12.840> I<00:03:12.930> said

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
overclocked and it's also like I said

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.570 
overclocked and it's also like I said
it's<00:03:13.230> cooler<00:03:13.530> so<00:03:14.310> all<00:03:14.880> in<00:03:15.120> all<00:03:15.209> this<00:03:15.510> is<00:03:15.570> the

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
it's cooler so all in all this is the

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.100 
it's cooler so all in all this is the
8600<00:03:17.580> GT<00:03:17.610> to<00:03:18.030> consider<00:03:18.360> all<00:03:18.810> right<00:03:18.900> now<00:03:18.989> this

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
8600 GT to consider all right now this

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.250

doodles<00:03:26.190> share<00:03:26.370> system<00:03:26.610> memory<00:03:26.970> so<00:03:27.120> if<00:03:27.239> you

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
doodles share system memory so if you

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:28.640 
doodles share system memory so if you

have more texture on the screen you have

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.319 
have more texture on the screen you have
your<00:03:28.709> higher<00:03:29.040> resolutions<00:03:29.610> it<00:03:29.970> can<00:03:30.120> share

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
your higher resolutions it can share

some of that system memory it's not

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.620 
some of that system memory it's not

here<00:03:33.870> but<00:03:34.320> it<00:03:34.440> will<00:03:34.560> help<00:03:34.829> with<00:03:35.340> DirectX<00:03:35.730> 10<00:03:35.910> I

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
here but it will help with DirectX 10 I

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.850 
here but it will help with DirectX 10 I
mean<00:03:36.120> DirectX<00:03:36.420> 10<00:03:36.540> is<00:03:36.690> great<00:03:36.959> great<00:03:37.440> coating

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
mean DirectX 10 is great great coating

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.120 
mean DirectX 10 is great great coating
also<00:03:38.280> this<00:03:38.880> one<00:03:39.120> will<00:03:39.450> push<00:03:39.750> about<00:03:40.130> 22.4

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
also this one will push about 22.4
