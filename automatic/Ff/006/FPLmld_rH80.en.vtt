00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.340 
this your buttons are going to be pretty
much<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:35.820> same<00:02:35.940> you<00:02:36.510> have<00:02:36.630> a<00:02:36.750> positive<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:37.290> a

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
much the same you have a positive and a

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.170 
much the same you have a positive and a
negative<00:02:37.380> point<00:02:37.980> you're<00:02:38.670> going<00:02:38.820> to<00:02:38.910> glue<00:02:39.120> your

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
negative point you're going to glue your

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.030 
negative point you're going to glue your
buttons<00:02:39.660> in<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:40.200> wherever<00:02:40.560> if<00:02:40.680> you<00:02:40.770> do<00:02:40.920> them

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
buttons in to wherever if you do them

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.250 
buttons in to wherever if you do them
over<00:02:41.100> here<00:02:41.430> like<00:02:41.640> I<00:02:41.880> did<00:02:42.150> on<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:43.230> side

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
over here like I did on the side

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.620 
over here like I did on the side
shoulders<00:02:44.010> or<00:02:44.400> if<00:02:44.550> you<00:02:44.640> do<00:02:44.790> them<00:02:44.970> here<00:02:45.360> which

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
shoulders or if you do them here which

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.750 
shoulders or if you do them here which
is<00:02:45.750> a<00:02:45.780> safe<00:02:46.020> spot<00:02:46.290> that<00:02:46.530> they<00:02:46.650> used<00:02:46.980> you're<00:02:47.640> do

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
is a safe spot that they used you're do

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.050 
is a safe spot that they used you're do
a<00:02:47.790> positive<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:48.330> a<00:02:48.390> negative<00:02:48.420> for<00:02:49.350> both<00:02:49.530> and

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
a positive and a negative for both and

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.400 
a positive and a negative for both and
those<00:02:51.060> buttons<00:02:51.450> run<00:02:51.720> to<00:02:51.840> different<00:02:52.170> places

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
those buttons run to different places

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.580 
those buttons run to different places
for<00:02:52.650> different<00:02:52.770> reasons<00:02:53.480> so<00:02:54.480> that's<00:02:55.080> that<00:02:55.380> and

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
for different reasons so that's that and

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.650 
for different reasons so that's that and
these<00:02:56.220> points<00:02:56.580> right<00:02:56.910> here<00:02:56.940> or<00:02:57.360> where<00:02:57.540> they

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
these points right here or where they

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.140 
these points right here or where they
drilled<00:02:58.020> in<00:02:58.290> if<00:02:58.620> you<00:02:58.739> look<00:02:59.010> here<00:02:59.370> there's<00:02:59.910> like

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
drilled in if you look here there's like

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.580 
drilled in if you look here there's like
almost<00:03:00.420> like<00:03:00.690> an<00:03:00.900> allen<00:03:01.200> key<00:03:01.230> type<00:03:03.140> thing<00:03:04.170> poke

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
almost like an allen key type thing poke

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.220 
almost like an allen key type thing poke
me<00:03:05.239> there's<00:03:06.239> almost<00:03:06.420> like<00:03:06.540> this<00:03:06.780> look<00:03:06.930> allen

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
me there's almost like this look allen

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.930 
me there's almost like this look allen
key<00:03:07.410> thing<00:03:07.680> this<00:03:07.950> is<00:03:08.100> on<00:03:08.190> the<00:03:08.280> plastic<00:03:08.730> here

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
key thing this is on the plastic here

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.790 
key thing this is on the plastic here
but<00:03:09.660> they<00:03:11.120> drill<00:03:12.120> that<00:03:12.360> in<00:03:12.570> and<00:03:12.959> locked<00:03:13.440> in<00:03:13.650> to

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
but they drill that in and locked in to

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.640 
but they drill that in and locked in to
make<00:03:13.950> their<00:03:14.100> paddle<00:03:14.489> and<00:03:14.640> they<00:03:15.090> used

make their paddle and they used

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.259 
make their paddle and they used
basically<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:17.040> same<00:03:17.280> buttons<00:03:17.940> that<00:03:18.120> I'm

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
basically the same buttons that I'm

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.090 
basically the same buttons that I'm
using<00:03:18.510> on<00:03:18.780> my<00:03:18.810> red<00:03:19.140> controller<00:03:19.650> though<00:03:19.860> little

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
using on my red controller though little

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.610 
using on my red controller though little
ones<00:03:20.340> they<00:03:20.760> used<00:03:21.120> those<00:03:21.630> but<00:03:21.989> a<00:03:22.049> shorter

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
ones they used those but a shorter

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.680 
ones they used those but a shorter
version<00:03:22.830> you<00:03:23.640> can<00:03:23.790> kind<00:03:24.060> of<00:03:24.209> see<00:03:24.390> it<00:03:24.510> here

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
version you can kind of see it here

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.949 
version you can kind of see it here
under<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.019> paddle<00:03:25.470> so<00:03:26.420> if<00:03:27.420> you<00:03:27.510> push<00:03:27.750> the

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
under the paddle so if you push the

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.890 
under the paddle so if you push the
paddle<00:03:28.320> anywhere<00:03:28.890> and<00:03:29.540> this<00:03:30.540> one<00:03:30.720> doesn't

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
paddle anywhere and this one doesn't

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.660 
paddle anywhere and this one doesn't
even<00:03:30.930> work<00:03:31.200> all<00:03:31.410> that<00:03:31.560> great<00:03:31.860> it<00:03:31.980> works<00:03:32.250> but<00:03:32.489> it

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
even work all that great it works but it

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:38.720 
even work all that great it works but it
see<00:03:32.850> how<00:03:32.970> it<00:03:33.000> was<00:03:33.180> kind<00:03:33.570> of<00:03:33.630> sticking<00:03:37.549> piece<00:03:38.549> of

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
see how it was kind of sticking piece of

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.050 
see how it was kind of sticking piece of
 I<00:03:39.299> mean<00:03:40.140> anyway<00:03:40.430> this<00:03:41.430> from<00:03:41.640> the<00:03:41.730> factory

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
 I mean anyway this from the factory

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.910 
 I mean anyway this from the factory
this<00:03:42.510> is<00:03:42.720> pretty<00:03:42.900> much<00:03:43.049> unmolested<00:03:43.410> I<00:03:43.739> didn't

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
this is pretty much unmolested I didn't

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.110 
this is pretty much unmolested I didn't
do<00:03:43.980> anything<00:03:44.160> to<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.459> paddles<00:03:44.760> never<00:03:44.970> took

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
do anything to the paddles never took

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.380 
do anything to the paddles never took
them<00:03:45.269> off<00:03:45.920> they<00:03:46.920> opted<00:03:47.489> on<00:03:47.640> my<00:03:47.910> particular

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
them off they opted on my particular

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.449 
them off they opted on my particular
controller<00:03:48.870> optic<00:03:49.440> and<00:03:49.620> people<00:03:50.010> say<00:03:50.160> I<00:03:50.190> didn't

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
controller optic and people say I didn't

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.430

get the maxed out version and those

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.289 
get the maxed out version and those
people<00:03:52.680> are<00:03:53.280> idiots<00:03:53.580> and<00:03:53.730> the

lipstick on it for another hundred bucks

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.830 
lipstick on it for another hundred bucks
versus<00:04:08.640> you<00:04:08.790> just<00:04:09.000> buying<00:04:09.209> the<00:04:09.360> regular<00:04:09.690> one

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
versus you just buying the regular one

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.600 
versus you just buying the regular one
and<00:04:10.019> putting<00:04:10.290> your<00:04:10.380> own<00:04:10.440> lipstick<00:04:10.920> on<00:04:11.130> it<00:04:11.310> and

and putting your own lipstick on it and

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:12.920 
and putting your own lipstick on it and
that's<00:04:11.820> the<00:04:11.910> same<00:04:12.120> I<00:04:12.269> mean<00:04:12.450> I<00:04:12.540> know<00:04:12.600> that's<00:04:12.840> a

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
that's the same I mean I know that's a

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.930 
that's the same I mean I know that's a
poor<00:04:13.170> analogy<00:04:13.560> but<00:04:13.920> that's<00:04:14.070> essentially<00:04:14.730> what

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
poor analogy but that's essentially what

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.270 
poor analogy but that's essentially what
they<00:04:15.090> did<00:04:15.329> all<00:04:15.959> that<00:04:16.320> pain<00:04:16.650> and<00:04:16.890> stuff<00:04:17.070> that

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
they did all that pain and stuff that

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.670 
they did all that pain and stuff that
they<00:04:17.400> when<00:04:17.760> they<00:04:17.880> painted<00:04:18.269> and<00:04:18.419> put<00:04:18.570> the<00:04:18.870> extra

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
they when they painted and put the extra

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.479 
they when they painted and put the extra
grip<00:04:19.919> on<00:04:20.190> it<00:04:20.370> doesn't<00:04:20.669> mean

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
grip on it doesn't mean

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.020 
grip on it doesn't mean
 it's<00:04:22.930> a<00:04:23.080> waste<00:04:23.319> of<00:04:23.530> resources<00:04:23.789> for<00:04:24.789> you

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
 it's a waste of resources for you

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.050 
 it's a waste of resources for you
you<00:04:25.479> can<00:04:25.599> do<00:04:25.690> all<00:04:25.810> that<00:04:25.840> yourself<00:04:26.050> or<00:04:26.729> and<00:04:27.729> it

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
you can do all that yourself or and it

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.719 
you can do all that yourself or and it
doesn't<00:04:28.330> affect<00:04:28.419> the<00:04:28.960> controller<00:04:29.400> he<00:04:30.400> doesn't

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
doesn't affect the controller he doesn't

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:31.980 
doesn't affect the controller he doesn't
make<00:04:30.819> it<00:04:30.849> better<00:04:31.120> because<00:04:31.389> it's<00:04:31.690> painted

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
make it better because it's painted

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.279 
make it better because it's painted
yellow

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:32.289 
yellow

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:34.290 
yellow
versus<00:04:33.160> painting<00:04:33.460> it<00:04:33.520> white<00:04:33.669> you're<00:04:34.150> not

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
versus painting it white you're not

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.029 
versus painting it white you're not
gonna<00:04:34.449> have<00:04:34.660> superpowers<00:04:35.020> or<00:04:35.440> anything<00:04:35.800> with

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.039 
gonna have superpowers or anything with

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:37.890 
gonna have superpowers or anything with
it<00:04:36.220> so<00:04:36.250> getting<00:04:37.060> it<00:04:37.150> out<00:04:37.240> of<00:04:37.270> your<00:04:37.449> head<00:04:37.630> you

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
it so getting it out of your head you

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.360 
it so getting it out of your head you
guys<00:04:38.050> that<00:04:38.259> come<00:04:38.470> in<00:04:38.620> and<00:04:38.770> said<00:04:38.949> well<00:04:39.160> you

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
guys that come in and said well you

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.040 
guys that come in and said well you
didn't<00:04:39.849> get<00:04:39.970> the<00:04:40.090> mech<00:04:40.270> start<00:04:40.539> version<00:04:40.900> that's

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
didn't get the mech start version that's

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.469 
didn't get the mech start version that's
why<00:04:41.199> it<00:04:41.380> sucks<00:04:41.940> you<00:04:42.940> know<00:04:43.000> you're<00:04:43.240> lying<00:04:43.389> to

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 
why it sucks you know you're lying to

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:46.050 
why it sucks you know you're lying to
yourself<00:04:43.660> there's<00:04:44.169> no<00:04:44.380> such<00:04:44.620> thing<00:04:44.889> the<00:04:45.759> grip

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
yourself there's no such thing the grip

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.300 
yourself there's no such thing the grip
is<00:04:46.330> the<00:04:46.569> big<00:04:46.960> difference<00:04:47.139> and<00:04:47.500> then<00:04:47.770> if<00:04:48.009> I<00:04:48.130> want

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
is the big difference and then if I want

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.890 
is the big difference and then if I want
to<00:04:48.430> get<00:04:48.520> skulls<00:04:48.849> or<00:04:49.060> something<00:04:49.330> painted<00:04:49.660> on<00:04:49.750> it

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
to get skulls or something painted on it

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.110 
to get skulls or something painted on it
versus<00:04:50.229> it<00:04:50.349> being<00:04:50.380> flat<00:04:50.860> black<00:04:51.190> the<00:04:51.669> insides

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
versus it being flat black the insides

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.860 
versus it being flat black the insides
are<00:04:52.300> exactly<00:04:52.690> the<00:04:52.900> same<00:04:53.190> on<00:04:54.190> to<00:04:54.430> the<00:04:54.490> next<00:04:54.870> so

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
are exactly the same on to the next so

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.200 
are exactly the same on to the next so
yeah<00:04:56.050> so<00:04:56.319> I<00:04:56.349> opted<00:04:56.830> to<00:04:56.889> keep<00:04:57.190> the<00:04:57.490> rumble<00:04:58.000> packs

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
yeah so I opted to keep the rumble packs

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.189 
yeah so I opted to keep the rumble packs
in<00:04:58.389> here<00:04:58.569> because<00:04:58.690> I'm<00:04:58.840> gonna<00:04:58.930> use<00:04:59.080> this

00:04:59.189 --> 00:04:59.199 
in here because I'm gonna use this

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:01.830 
in here because I'm gonna use this
controller<00:04:59.560> to<00:04:59.710> play<00:04:59.860> other<00:05:00.159> games<00:05:00.539> not<00:05:01.539> just

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
controller to play other games not just

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.499 
controller to play other games not just
as<00:05:02.020> a<00:05:02.139> scuf<00:05:02.830> controller<00:05:03.090> whoa

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:04.509 
as a scuf controller whoa

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:06.629 
as a scuf controller whoa
and<00:05:04.599> so<00:05:05.470> I<00:05:05.500> didn't<00:05:05.889> take<00:05:06.009> those<00:05:06.190> out<00:05:06.340> but<00:05:06.520> if

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 
and so I didn't take those out but if

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.279 
and so I didn't take those out but if
you<00:05:06.729> do<00:05:06.880> want<00:05:07.090> to<00:05:07.120> take<00:05:07.300> them<00:05:07.479> out<00:05:07.630> I<00:05:07.840> may<00:05:08.080> do<00:05:08.259> a
