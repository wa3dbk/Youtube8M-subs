the surface case is one of my favorite

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.550 
the surface case is one of my favorite
cases<00:01:08.520> that<00:01:09.000> said<00:01:09.270> he<00:01:09.360> provides<00:01:09.750> because<00:01:10.110> it's

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
cases that said he provides because it's

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.490 
cases that said he provides because it's
thin<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.100> it's<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.880> hard<00:01:12.180> material<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:12.990> all

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
thin and it's a hard material and all

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.080 
thin and it's a hard material and all
the<00:01:13.619> edges<00:01:13.979> are<00:01:14.040> going<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.250> be<00:01:14.310> protected<00:01:14.880> and

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
the edges are going to be protected and

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.289 
the edges are going to be protected and
the<00:01:15.659> reason<00:01:15.810> being<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.470> because<00:01:16.729> it's<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.970> glide

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
the reason being is because it's a glide

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.200 
the reason being is because it's a glide
on<00:01:18.600> or<00:01:18.869> slide<00:01:19.170> on<00:01:19.350> style<00:01:19.740> case<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.820> they

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
on or slide on style case so they

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.300

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
hard plastic fuel so you get a nice

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.290 
hard plastic fuel so you get a nice
little<00:02:43.890> cutout<00:02:44.250> for<00:02:44.520> your<00:02:44.670> headphone<00:02:45.030> jack

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
and most connections should work with

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.730 
and most connections should work with
that<00:02:47.310> because<00:02:48.120> it's<00:02:48.450> not<00:02:48.690> too<00:02:48.900> bulky<00:02:49.140> at<00:02:49.530> all

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
that because it's not too bulky at all

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.860 
that because it's not too bulky at all
and<00:02:50.550> then<00:02:50.700> you<00:02:50.790> get<00:02:50.970> cutouts<00:02:51.330> for<00:02:51.420> any<00:02:51.660> kind<00:02:51.750> of

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
edges corner protection is good so this

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.810 
edges corner protection is good so this

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.640 
it's a metal kickstand at spring action
and<00:03:37.920> it's<00:03:38.730> magnetic<00:03:39.360> so<00:03:40.260> that<00:03:40.380> way<00:03:40.500> it<00:03:40.590> stays

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
and it's magnetic so that way it stays

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.080 
and it's magnetic so that way it stays
closed<00:03:41.250> and<00:03:42.950> it's<00:03:43.950> just<00:03:44.160> nice<00:03:44.370> to<00:03:44.400> this<00:03:44.700> metal

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
closed and it's just nice to this metal

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.690 
closed and it's just nice to this metal
you<00:03:45.300> don't<00:03:45.450> have<00:03:45.540> a<00:03:45.600> plastic<00:03:46.070> kickstand<00:03:47.070> and

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
you don't have a plastic kickstand and

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.090 
you don't have a plastic kickstand and
you<00:03:47.910> can<00:03:48.060> see<00:03:48.239> that<00:03:48.270> it<00:03:48.570> works<00:03:48.600> just<00:03:49.260> easy<00:03:49.800> if

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
you can see that it works just easy if

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.830 
you can see that it works just easy if
you<00:03:50.250> don't<00:03:50.400> want<00:03:50.610> it<00:03:50.700> it's<00:03:50.940> not<00:03:51.270> really<00:03:51.600> in<00:03:51.750> the

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
you don't want it it's not really in the

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.780 
you don't want it it's not really in the
way<00:03:51.989> at<00:03:52.110> all<00:03:52.230> it<00:03:52.890> doesn't<00:03:53.190> add<00:03:53.310> that<00:03:53.580> much<00:03:53.760> more

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
way at all it doesn't add that much more

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.050 
way at all it doesn't add that much more
bulk<00:03:54.239> and<00:03:54.770> actually<00:03:55.770> because<00:03:56.160> of<00:03:56.310> this<00:03:56.459> the

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
bulk and actually because of this the

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.800 
bulk and actually because of this the
Moto<00:03:57.810> X<00:03:58.110> is<00:03:58.440> that<00:03:58.680> rounded<00:03:59.220> edge<00:03:59.690> check<00:04:00.690> this

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
Moto X is that rounded edge check this

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.060 
Moto X is that rounded edge check this
out<00:04:01.190> adds<00:04:02.190> a<00:04:02.550> little<00:04:02.700> bit<00:04:02.820> more<00:04:03.030> stability

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
out adds a little bit more stability

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.290 
out adds a little bit more stability
it's<00:04:05.070> not<00:04:05.250> going<00:04:05.430> to<00:04:05.489> wiggle<00:04:05.610> around<00:04:05.820> as<00:04:06.120> much

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
it's not going to wiggle around as much

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.620 
it's not going to wiggle around as much
because<00:04:06.660> that<00:04:06.930> rounded<00:04:07.430> back<00:04:08.430> that<00:04:09.300> it<00:04:09.450> has

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
because that rounded back that it has

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.750 
because that rounded back that it has
here<00:04:10.050> that<00:04:10.260> kickstand<00:04:10.860> kind<00:04:11.190> of<00:04:11.280> flattens<00:04:11.670> it

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
here that kickstand kind of flattens it

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.210 
here that kickstand kind of flattens it
out<00:04:11.940> so<00:04:12.540> that's<00:04:12.720> a<00:04:12.810> pretty<00:04:12.959> cool<00:04:13.200> feature<00:04:13.410> to

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.860 
out so that's a pretty cool feature to
take<00:04:14.459> notice<00:04:14.760> of<00:04:17.000> as<00:04:18.000> far<00:04:18.209> as<00:04:18.239> putting<00:04:18.450> it<00:04:18.690> in

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
take notice of as far as putting it in
