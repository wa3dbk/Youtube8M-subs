in<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.119> jungle<00:01:18.479> firstly<00:01:18.960> he<00:01:19.259> kind<00:01:19.470> of

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
in the jungle firstly he kind of

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.830 
in the jungle firstly he kind of
struggles<00:01:20.040> against<00:01:20.430> strong<00:01:20.909> enemy<00:01:21.420> junglers

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
struggles against strong enemy junglers

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.630 
struggles against strong enemy junglers
he<00:01:21.960> can't<00:01:22.170> really<00:01:22.409> hold<00:01:22.740> his<00:01:22.920> own<00:01:23.070> if<00:01:23.310> he<00:01:23.490> gets

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
he can't really hold his own if he gets

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.390 
he can't really hold his own if he gets
invaded<00:01:24.119> next<00:01:24.840> blitzcrank<00:01:25.259> has<00:01:25.500> no<00:01:25.830> sustained

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
invaded next blitzcrank has no sustained

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.190 
invaded next blitzcrank has no sustained
so<00:01:26.670> he<00:01:26.880> can<00:01:27.060> actually<00:01:27.450> fall<00:01:27.659> quite<00:01:27.900> low<00:01:28.140> on

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
so he can actually fall quite low on

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.749 
so he can actually fall quite low on
health<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.619> mana<00:01:28.829> if<00:01:29.130> he's<00:01:29.280> clear<00:01:29.549> in<00:01:29.640> that

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
health and mana if he's clear in that

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.880 
health and mana if he's clear in that
jungle<00:01:30.060> also<00:01:30.810> if<00:01:31.020> you<00:01:31.049> takes<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.439> lot<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.590> damage

jungle also if you takes a lot of damage
in<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.250> gank<00:01:32.579> then<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.150> can<00:01:33.270> actually<00:01:33.420> quite

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
in a gank then that can actually quite

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.929 
in a gank then that can actually quite
handcuff<00:01:34.200> him<00:01:34.380> too<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.829> lastly<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.579> this<00:01:35.670> is

handcuff him too and lastly and this is

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.090 
handcuff him too and lastly and this is

team comes which have very strong front

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.520 
team comes which have very strong front
liners<00:01:45.210> because<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.750> don't<00:01:45.990> want<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.290> grab

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
liners because you don't want to grab

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.410 
liners because you don't want to grab
them<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:46.920> if<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.340> don't<00:01:47.520> have<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.759> good<00:01:48.119> grab

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
them and if you don't have a good grab

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.510 
them and if you don't have a good grab
target<00:01:48.869> then<00:01:49.290> blitzcrank<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:49.860> fairly<00:01:50.130> useless

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
target then blitzcrank is fairly useless

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.940 
target then blitzcrank is fairly useless
so<00:01:51.149> overall<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:51.689> would<00:01:51.899> say<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.259> blitzcrank

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
so overall I would say that blitzcrank

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.160 
so overall I would say that blitzcrank
is<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.130> bit<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.729> gimmicky<00:01:54.329> jungler<00:01:54.780> but<00:01:55.020> he

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
is a bit of a gimmicky jungler but he

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.350 
is a bit of a gimmicky jungler but he
can<00:01:55.320> be<00:01:55.409> very<00:01:55.439> good<00:01:55.950> in<00:01:56.009> snow<00:01:56.579> board<00:01:56.850> games<00:01:57.119> and

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
can be very good in snow board games and

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.450 
can be very good in snow board games and
for<00:01:57.509> people<00:01:57.750> who<00:01:57.899> just<00:01:57.930> in<00:01:58.350> general<00:01:58.560> like<00:01:58.950> to

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
for people who just in general like to

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.609 
for people who just in general like to
be<00:01:59.579> very<00:01:59.880> aggressive<00:02:00.180> as<00:02:00.719> junglers<00:02:01.229> he's

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
be very aggressive as junglers he's

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.319 
be very aggressive as junglers he's
definitely<00:02:02.040> not<00:02:02.130> as<00:02:02.250> threatening<00:02:02.610> as<00:02:02.969> some<00:02:03.210> of

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
definitely not as threatening as some of

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.940 
definitely not as threatening as some of
the<00:02:03.390> other<00:02:03.600> junglers<00:02:04.020> but<00:02:04.380> he<00:02:04.469> can<00:02:04.590> still<00:02:04.710> be

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
the other junglers but he can still be

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.410 
the other junglers but he can still be
very<00:02:05.130> effective<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.909> wouldn't<00:02:06.270> necessarily

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
very effective I wouldn't necessarily

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.600 
very effective I wouldn't necessarily
recommend<00:02:06.869> that<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:07.409> mayne<00:02:07.649> him<00:02:07.890> in<00:02:07.979> soloq

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
recommend that you mayne him in soloq

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.010 
recommend that you mayne him in soloq
however<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.119> I<00:02:09.149> do<00:02:09.209> think<00:02:09.539> this<00:02:09.750> can<00:02:09.899> actually

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
however and I do think this can actually

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.199 
however and I do think this can actually
hold<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:10.500> back<00:02:10.739> if<00:02:11.009> you're<00:02:11.190> doing<00:02:11.580> that<00:02:11.760> he's

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
hold you back if you're doing that he's

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.630 
hold you back if you're doing that he's
good<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.660> play<00:02:12.780> every<00:02:13.170> now<00:02:13.349> and

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
good to play every now and

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.250 
good to play every now and
then<00:02:13.760> but<00:02:14.180> not<00:02:14.330> someone<00:02:14.720> that<00:02:14.750> I<00:02:14.870> would<00:02:15.050> fall

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
then but not someone that I would fall

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.080 
then but not someone that I would fall
back<00:02:15.410> on<00:02:15.650> regularly<00:02:16.130> for<00:02:16.580> those<00:02:16.730> of<00:02:16.850> you<00:02:16.910> who

season<00:02:19.550> two<00:02:19.910> blitzcrank<00:02:20.840> is<00:02:20.990> extremely

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
season two blitzcrank is extremely

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.650 
season two blitzcrank is extremely
similar<00:02:22.010> to<00:02:22.190> that<00:02:22.490> kind<00:02:22.730> of<00:02:22.910> play<00:02:23.150> style<00:02:23.480> it's

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
similar to that kind of play style it's

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.360 
similar to that kind of play style it's
not<00:02:23.780> quite<00:02:24.020> the<00:02:24.050> same<00:02:24.440> but<00:02:24.709> it's<00:02:25.069> pretty<00:02:25.190> much

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
not quite the same but it's pretty much

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.490 
not quite the same but it's pretty much
as<00:02:25.580> close<00:02:25.790> as<00:02:25.970> it<00:02:26.120> gets<00:02:26.150> now<00:02:26.690> in<00:02:26.870> season<00:02:27.230> four

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
as close as it gets now in season four

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.930 
as close as it gets now in season four
so<00:02:27.890> I<00:02:27.920> feel<00:02:28.100> the<00:02:28.220> type<00:02:28.400> of<00:02:28.430> John<00:02:28.760> Lowe<00:02:28.910> who

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
so I feel the type of John Lowe who

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.610 
so I feel the type of John Lowe who
really<00:02:29.390> likes<00:02:29.600> going<00:02:29.780> balls<00:02:30.110> to<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.380> wall

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
really likes going balls to the wall

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.190 
really likes going balls to the wall

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
pretty solid choice in that regard that

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.070 
pretty solid choice in that regard that

that even if you do fall behind it

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
that even if you do fall behind it
doesn't<00:02:44.360> really<00:02:44.420> matter<00:02:44.630> because<00:02:44.900> you're
