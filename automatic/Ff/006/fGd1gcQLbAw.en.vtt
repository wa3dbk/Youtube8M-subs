years<00:00:16.560> ago<00:00:16.800> in<00:00:20.150> speculation<00:00:27.769> disaster<00:00:28.769> to

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
years ago in speculation disaster to

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.209 
years ago in speculation disaster to
this<00:00:30.000> planet<00:00:30.470> the<00:00:31.969> researchers<00:00:33.950> because<00:00:34.950> they

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
this planet the researchers because they

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.209 
this planet the researchers because they
tied<00:00:35.610> in<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.000> previous<00:00:36.739> appearance<00:00:37.739> of<00:00:37.980> this

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
tied in the previous appearance of this

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:48.709 
tied in the previous appearance of this
star<00:00:45.500> so<00:00:46.500> people<00:00:47.239> established<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.390> point

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
star so people established that point

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.889 
star so people established that point
they<00:00:49.200> look<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.680> point<00:00:49.920> make<00:00:50.100> up<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.430> us

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
they look to the point make up to us

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.869 
they look to the point make up to us
2003<00:00:51.899> they<00:00:52.140> said<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.680> wall<00:00:52.890> turn<00:00:53.039> away<00:00:53.160> there

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
2003 they said the wall turn away there

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.540 
2003 they said the wall turn away there
was<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.120> huge<00:00:54.329> large<00:00:55.199> rebellious<00:00:55.800> now<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.039> think

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
was a huge large rebellious now I think

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.330 
was a huge large rebellious now I think
to<00:00:56.670> some<00:00:56.820> degree<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.270> was<00:00:57.920> the<00:00:58.920> millennium

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
to some degree it was the millennium

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:29.300 
to some degree it was the millennium
party<00:00:59.780> to<00:01:00.780> pay

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
this question as well what is

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.880 
this question as well what is
Valentine's<00:01:45.480> due<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.870> appear

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.219 

I<00:01:50.590> can't<00:01:51.590> really<00:01:51.770> mix<00:01:52.100> good<00:01:52.400> did<00:01:53.240> the

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
I can't really mix good did the

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.170 
I can't really mix good did the
mathematics<00:01:54.920> with<00:01:55.159> Zecharia<00:01:55.880> Sitchin's

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
mathematics with Zecharia Sitchin's

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.880 
mathematics with Zecharia Sitchin's
works<00:01:56.600> and<00:01:56.930> it<00:01:57.020> put<00:01:57.229> it<00:01:57.380> off<00:01:57.560> of<00:01:57.800> another

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
works and it put it off of another

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.140 
works and it put it off of another
thousand<00:01:58.580> years<00:01:58.790> so<00:01:59.060> I<00:02:00.020> i<00:02:00.770> can<00:02:01.280> honestly<00:02:01.520> state

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
thousand years so I i can honestly state

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.730 
thousand years so I i can honestly state
that<00:02:02.479> i<00:02:02.590> have<00:02:03.590> an<00:02:03.770> answer<00:02:04.040> for<00:02:04.070> that<00:02:04.810> but<00:02:05.810> i<00:02:06.500> did

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
that i have an answer for that but i did

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.889 
that i have an answer for that but i did
just<00:02:06.770> recently<00:02:07.100> last<00:02:07.729> year<00:02:07.940> ago<00:02:08.270> and<00:02:08.479> perform

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
questions for them okay when you got

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.760 
questions for them okay when you got
sleep<00:02:17.450> is<00:02:17.630> there<00:02:17.810> yeah<00:02:19.000> what<00:02:20.000> a<00:02:20.030> nice<00:02:20.300> eye<00:02:20.770> and

that<00:02:40.820> we<00:02:41.030> can<00:02:41.300> burn<00:02:41.780> all<00:02:42.110> of<00:02:42.140> this<00:02:42.500> problem

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
that we can burn all of this problem

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.340 
that we can burn all of this problem
through<00:02:43.360> energy<00:02:44.360> manipulation<00:02:44.750> of<00:02:45.110> our<00:02:45.230> own

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
the vibration of the planet and this

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.460 
the vibration of the planet and this
will<00:02:52.940> transform<00:02:53.209> us<00:02:53.690> instead<00:02:54.110> of<00:02:54.170> the
