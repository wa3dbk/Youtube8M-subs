00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.139
 hello friends welcome to the analyzes 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.540
 behind tangled today several I present 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:13.030
 the house and x bionic its running effects 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.790
 power pans a few pants of the house 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.590
 Swiss that is characterized by having a lot 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.090
 technology by incorporating many 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.890
 novelties in their garments 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.840
 we are going to go desgranando the first of 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:27.369
 all composition of polyamide agreement 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:29.259
 more elastan plus polypropylene to give 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.779
 that consistency to that fiber that does not 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.190
 absorb the sweat according to us 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.230
 teaching first of all this part of 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.880
 here we see this front this 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.650
 It is the lic 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.930
 part to the compression are basically 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.420
 These cell lines we see that what 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.850
 they do is generate a thickness and by the 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.190
 lower part generates a space what 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.050
 make that cell in agreement let's think that 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.460
 cell inside is empty not no 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.320
 is in contact with the skin is 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.700
 get a better adaptation of 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.860
 our body temperature and 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.870
 manages to transmit much better sweat 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.660
 and the partial compression is basically 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.910
 because what compresses us is each 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.140
 of the stripes so we have compression 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.299
 but without having all the muscle 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.729
 completely compressed but it gives you 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:11.650
 with the necessary precision and also 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.990
 generates a cells with a camera 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.550
 at the top here, look at 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.410
 this upper part usually accumulates 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.770
 sweat is also on the back good 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:23.400
 this is the 3 of bionic spears system is 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.960
 some cells also with a thickness more 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.820
 great that there is a part that touches us the 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.190
 body and another part that generates the 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.670
 hole this hole that we see here and what 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.890
 What it does is catch the sweat and 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.410
 transport it to the outside and 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.030
 above all generate more circulation of 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.530
 air inside to get everything out 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.619
 we also have this in the part 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:47.229
 back here on top 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.850
 finally also on knees part that 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.430
 often suffer much to notice all these 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.930
 lateral reinforcements fix is everything here and 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.670
 is on the inside also in the 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.119
 back this whole area usually 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:01.210
 suffer quite agree they have put the 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.770
 link of the ex impact technology and it's all 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.780
 this compression these cells but at 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.610
 reverse on the outside that activates 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.280
 in our neural system and that what 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.110
 they do is prevent us from feeling so 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.459
 fatigued also here in the part 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.890
 front to all this part of here 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.080
 It is also reinforced with the system 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.810
 partial compression just like it happens 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.569
 as well 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.520
 in the back part of the twin so 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:26.150
 we have compression here in front we have 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.940
 areas with reinforcement to prevent it from 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.290
 so much of this area here zones 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.840
 with more freedom of movement in the 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.450
 knee to be able to work better and 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.830
 areas with much more perspiration besides 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.900
 have been included in here in the part 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.519
 top a pocket where you can save 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.200
 the keys when we went for a run 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.140
 we will have much more in this 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.810
 pocket and is that it is a very pants 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.640
 tight and thought to work in each 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.280
 body area and make us feel 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.739
 comfortable, all this has been measured 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.200
 they have put him in a corridor he has 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.430
 measured with and without the position and have they get 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.630
 to the conclusion that with some pants 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.790
 how will we get 10% more 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.380
 performance that we will get 7% 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.540
 less lactate will be generated less 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.310
 lactate with them 50% less than 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.310
 warm feeling we agree 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.220
 We feel much better and 20% more 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.470
 recovery and 2.4 beats less 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.790
 doing exactly the same exercise 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.560
 and is that if the body does not have to 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.690
 editing work to go 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.410
 temperature and muscles because the 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.600
 own garment 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.520
 It is not compacting, it is also going to 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.410
 feel relieved and the heart goes to 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.210
 work something less all this what 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.580
 we will try as always attentive to the 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.890
 review a lot of technology in these effects 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.750
 running power pans analyzed from behind 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.310
 rain review as always we encourage you to 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.870
 follow us on our social networks in 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.980
 our youtube channel or on our website 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.370
 of the barn dotcom 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.370
 until next time
