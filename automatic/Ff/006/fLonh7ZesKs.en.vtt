00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
understand how the bad cholesterol LDL C

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:53.140 
understand how the bad cholesterol LDL C
contributes<00:04:52.160> to<00:04:52.250> cardiovascular<00:04:52.790> disease

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
contributes to cardiovascular disease

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.140 
contributes to cardiovascular disease
and<00:04:53.720> atherosclerosis<00:04:54.260> and<00:04:55.070> what<00:04:55.730> that<00:04:55.940> means

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
and atherosclerosis and what that means
