a.m.<00:02:30.680> and<00:02:30.980> I<00:02:31.040> got<00:02:31.190> my<00:02:31.310> practice<00:02:31.700> in<00:02:31.819> because<00:02:32.090> I

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
a.m. and I got my practice in because I

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.550 
a.m. and I got my practice in because I
had<00:02:32.269> arrived<00:02:32.540> two<00:02:32.780> hours<00:02:32.810> earlier<00:02:33.379> on<00:02:33.500> the

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
had arrived two hours earlier on the

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.190 
had arrived two hours earlier on the
plane<00:02:33.799> but<00:02:34.430> I<00:02:34.489> was<00:02:34.760> stoked<00:02:35.030> and<00:02:35.269> and<00:02:35.540> I<00:02:35.959> had

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
plane but I was stoked and and I had

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.050 
plane but I was stoked and and I had
been<00:02:36.319> skating<00:02:36.620> a<00:02:36.680> lot<00:02:36.889> and<00:02:37.100> then<00:02:37.190> and<00:02:37.730> I<00:02:37.880> felt

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
been skating a lot and then and I felt

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.849 
been skating a lot and then and I felt
like<00:02:38.120> I<00:02:38.209> skated<00:02:38.480> pretty<00:02:38.720> well<00:02:38.900> and<00:02:39.410> then<00:02:39.560> I<00:02:39.590> won

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:39.859 
like I skated pretty well and then I won

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:42.220 
like I skated pretty well and then I won
and<00:02:40.100> I<00:02:40.160> think<00:02:40.340> I<00:02:40.400> flew<00:02:41.389> to<00:02:41.600> the<00:02:41.690> X<00:02:41.870> Games<00:02:42.079> of

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
and I think I flew to the X Games of

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.410 
and I think I flew to the X Games of
that<00:02:42.350> very<00:02:42.650> evening

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.449 

it<00:02:48.420> was<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.690> only<00:02:48.810> vert<00:02:49.769> ramp<00:02:49.980> that<00:02:50.129> you<00:02:50.250> knew

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
it was the only vert ramp that you knew

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.100 
it was the only vert ramp that you knew
if<00:02:50.819> you<00:02:50.970> had<00:02:51.180> something<00:02:51.390> in<00:02:51.569> mind<00:02:51.720> you<00:02:51.900> want<00:02:52.019> to

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
if you had something in mind you want to

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.690 
if you had something in mind you want to
do<00:02:52.260> you<00:02:52.409> could<00:02:52.530> probably<00:02:52.769> go<00:02:53.129> there<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.459> do<00:02:53.580> it

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
do you could probably go there and do it

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:54.770 
do you could probably go there and do it
because<00:02:53.970> you<00:02:54.090> didn't<00:02:54.330> have<00:02:54.420> to<00:02:54.510> worry<00:02:54.690> about

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
because you didn't have to worry about

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.589 
because you didn't have to worry about
the<00:02:55.500> ramps<00:02:56.040> sucking<00:02:56.489> so<00:02:56.670> bad<00:02:56.909> that<00:02:56.940> it's<00:02:57.299> ate

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
when you think about like the the

itself<00:04:21.690> and<00:04:21.959> the<00:04:22.140> crew<00:04:22.410> are<00:04:22.620> one<00:04:23.010> of<00:04:23.100> the<00:04:23.190> few

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
itself and the crew are one of the few

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.730 
itself and the crew are one of the few
pure<00:04:24.090> things<00:04:24.510> still<00:04:24.810> left<00:04:24.990> in<00:04:25.169> skateboarding

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
pure things still left in skateboarding

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.610 
pure things still left in skateboarding
I<00:04:25.980> mean<00:04:26.700> it<00:04:26.850> was<00:04:27.450> formed<00:04:27.930> because<00:04:28.050> of<00:04:28.320> the<00:04:28.410> love

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
I mean it was formed because of the love

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.260 
I mean it was formed because of the love
of<00:04:28.650> the<00:04:28.770> sport<00:04:29.130> I<00:04:29.400> think<00:04:29.430> those<00:04:29.820> guys<00:04:30.000> are<00:04:30.180> the

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
of the sport I think those guys are the

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.480 
of the sport I think those guys are the
