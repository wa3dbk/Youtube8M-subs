00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:26.870 
take a look at the build itself and as

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.780 
take a look at the build itself and as
you<00:01:27.050> can<00:01:27.170> see<00:01:27.230> power<00:01:27.740> duration<00:01:28.400> and<00:01:28.580> power

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
you can see power duration and power

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.200 
you can see power duration and power
strength<00:01:29.240> are<00:01:30.140> the<00:01:30.380> things<00:01:30.680> I<00:01:30.920> focused<00:01:31.670> motion

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
strength are the things I focused motion

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.890 
strength are the things I focused motion
I<00:01:33.040> also<00:01:34.040> put<00:01:34.550> a<00:01:34.580> redirection<00:01:35.240> lot<00:01:35.630> there

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
I also put a redirection lot there

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.590 
I also put a redirection lot there

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
because the bell keyer has very low

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.100
