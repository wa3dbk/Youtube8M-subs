00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
NT and in today's video I'm going to

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.599 
NT and in today's video I'm going to
show<00:00:14.250> you<00:00:14.309> how<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.549> make<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.759> butt<00:00:15.059> switch<00:00:15.410> BAM

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:16.609 
show you how to make a butt switch BAM

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:19.040 
show you how to make a butt switch BAM
alright<00:00:17.609> so<00:00:17.820> here<00:00:18.150> is<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.630> bud<00:00:18.869> switch

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
alright so here is the bud switch

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.200 
alright so here is the bud switch
there's<00:00:19.619> a<00:00:19.710> lot<00:00:20.039> of<00:00:20.070> different<00:00:20.369> kind<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.060> but

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
there's a lot of different kind of but

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.970 
there's a lot of different kind of but
switches<00:00:21.539> this<00:00:21.660> is<00:00:21.810> one<00:00:22.350> of<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.529> main<00:00:22.680> ones<00:00:22.710> I

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
switches this is one of the main ones I

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.769 
switches this is one of the main ones I
use<00:00:23.250> just<00:00:23.580> because<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:24.090> can<00:00:24.269> remember<00:00:24.510> how<00:00:24.720> to

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
use just because I can remember how to

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.380 
use just because I can remember how to
make<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.109> very<00:00:25.230> easily<00:00:25.789> there's<00:00:26.789> others<00:00:27.359> that

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
make it very easily there's others that

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.750 
make it very easily there's others that
are<00:00:27.660> more<00:00:27.810> condensed<00:00:28.439> others<00:00:28.740> that<00:00:28.949> you<00:00:29.189> know

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
are more condensed others that you know

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.330 
are more condensed others that you know
actually<00:00:30.529> react<00:00:31.529> off<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.890> back<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.070> the

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
actually react off the back of the

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.889 
actually react off the back of the
piston<00:00:32.759> basically<00:00:33.270> it's<00:00:33.390> all<00:00:33.540> about<00:00:33.719> what's

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
piston basically it's all about what's

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.940 
piston basically it's all about what's
happening<00:00:34.290> on<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.860> piston<00:00:35.450> and<00:00:36.450> see<00:00:36.950> it

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
happening on the piston and see it

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.760 
happening on the piston and see it
updates<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.760> creates<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.450> signal<00:00:39.809> the

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
updates it and creates a signal the

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.869 
updates it and creates a signal the
reason<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.100> like<00:00:41.280> this<00:00:41.460> one<00:00:41.520> in<00:00:41.760> particular

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
reason I like this one in particular

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.840 
reason I like this one in particular
that<00:00:42.210> is<00:00:42.540> because<00:00:42.930> as<00:00:43.559> you<00:00:44.370> can<00:00:44.399> see<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:44.730> can

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
that is because as you can see you can

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.900 
that is because as you can see you can
do<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.000> pulse<00:00:45.300> like<00:00:45.480> on/off<00:00:46.070> same<00:00:47.070> on/off<00:00:47.579> tore

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
do a pulse like on/off same on/off tore

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.630 
do a pulse like on/off same on/off tore
open<00:00:48.059> close<00:00:48.559> if<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.800> set<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.070> from<00:00:50.280> anywhere

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
open close if you set it from anywhere

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.760 
open close if you set it from anywhere
to<00:00:50.700> 12<00:00:51.210> for<00:00:51.539> ticks<00:00:51.809> it'll<00:00:52.170> just<00:00:52.199> do<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.500> simple

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
to 12 for ticks it'll just do a simple

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.099 
to 12 for ticks it'll just do a simple
on<00:00:54.020> you<00:00:55.020> know<00:00:55.170> or<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.010> simple<00:00:56.399> off<00:00:56.930> you<00:00:57.930> can

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
on you know or a simple off you can

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.020 
on you know or a simple off you can
reverse<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:58.920> like<00:00:59.129> right<00:00:59.280> now<00:00:59.430> it's<00:00:59.579> off<00:00:59.760> by

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
reverse it so like right now it's off by

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:08.480 
reverse it so like right now it's off by
default<00:01:04.460> or<00:01:05.659> you<00:01:06.659> can<00:01:06.810> set<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.020> towards<00:01:07.470> on<00:01:08.100> by

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
default or you can set it towards on by

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.890 
default or you can set it towards on by
default<00:01:11.150> alright<00:01:12.150> cool<00:01:12.360> so<00:01:12.390> let<00:01:12.659> me<00:01:12.750> show<00:01:12.869> you

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
default alright cool so let me show you

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.469 
default alright cool so let me show you
guys<00:01:13.020> how<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.229> build<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:13.619> thing<00:01:14.479> and

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
guys how to build this thing and

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.020 
guys how to build this thing and
honestly<00:01:15.960> at<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.350> end<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.740> day<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.280> don't

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
honestly at the end of the day I don't

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.330 
honestly at the end of the day I don't
know<00:01:18.090> exactly<00:01:18.570> why<00:01:19.020> they<00:01:19.290> work<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:20.009> way<00:01:20.159> they

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
know exactly why they work the way they

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.190 
know exactly why they work the way they
work<00:01:21.409> you<00:01:22.409> know<00:01:23.000> but<00:01:24.000> they<00:01:24.119> work<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.600> they

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
work you know but they work and they

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.819 
work you know but they work and they
serve<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.500> lot<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.979> different<00:01:26.280> purposes<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:27.829> was

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
serve a lot of different purposes I was

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.499 
serve a lot of different purposes I was
building<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.340> tree<00:01:29.759> machine<00:01:30.090> like<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.270> long<00:01:30.479> time

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
building a tree machine like a long time

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.010 
building a tree machine like a long time
ago<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:31.670> it<00:01:32.670> was<00:01:32.820> wanted<00:01:33.180> like<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.390> hidden

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
ago and it was wanted like the hidden

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.200 
ago and it was wanted like the hidden
steps<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.009> can<00:01:35.250> think<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.700> i<00:01:35.820> had<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.030> couple

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
steps that I can think of i had a couple

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.690 
steps that I can think of i had a couple
buttons<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:37.049> know<00:01:37.170> going<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:38.250> make<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.520> thing

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
buttons you know going to make the thing

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.100 
buttons you know going to make the thing
work<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.210> then<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:39.329> figured<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:39.780> know<00:01:39.900> but

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
work and then I figured you know but

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.420 
work and then I figured you know but
switch<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.650> then<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:40.799> used<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.040> completely

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
switch and then I used a completely

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.889 
switch and then I used a completely
different<00:01:41.759> one<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:42.030> was<00:01:42.119> just<00:01:42.299> like<00:01:42.600> one

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
different one that was just like one

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.460 
different one that was just like one
white<00:01:43.460> but<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.549> was<00:01:44.640> pretty<00:01:44.850> lengthy<00:01:45.259> but<00:01:46.259> yeah

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
white but it was pretty lengthy but yeah

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.620 
white but it was pretty lengthy but yeah
it<00:01:46.560> was<00:01:46.920> awesome<00:01:47.070> so<00:01:48.000> what<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.210> do<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.390> just

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
it was awesome so what you do is just

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.330 
it was awesome so what you do is just
build<00:01:48.869> this<00:01:49.049> I<00:01:49.350> main<00:01:49.619> thing<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:49.829> remember<00:01:49.950> is

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
build this I main thing to remember is

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.789 
build this I main thing to remember is
the<00:01:50.630> repeater<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:51.720> aligned<00:01:52.110> with<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.439> piston

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
the repeater is aligned with the piston

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.319 
the repeater is aligned with the piston
and<00:01:52.829> then<00:01:53.159> this<00:01:53.399> block<00:01:53.700> appears<00:01:54.149> very

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
and then this block appears very

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.630 
and then this block appears very
important<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.799> signal<00:01:56.100> just<00:01:56.130> has<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.520> go

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
important the signal just has to go

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.609 
important the signal just has to go
around<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.119> this<00:01:57.329> was<00:01:57.509> some<00:01:57.659> massive<00:01:58.110> loop<00:01:58.350> it

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
around so this was some massive loop it

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.069 
around so this was some massive loop it
would<00:01:58.799> still<00:01:59.040> work<00:01:59.420> your<00:02:00.420> output<00:02:00.750> is<00:02:00.869> right

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
would still work your output is right

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.510 
would still work your output is right
here<00:02:01.549> we'll<00:02:02.549> use<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.820> door<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:04.189> yeah<00:02:05.189> basically

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
here we'll use a door and yeah basically

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.210 
here we'll use a door and yeah basically
a<00:02:05.909> block<00:02:06.240> here<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.600> like<00:02:06.750> allow<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.799> signal<00:02:08.190> to

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
a block here to like allow the signal to

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.229 
a block here to like allow the signal to
travel<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.789> stop<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:09.509> like<00:02:09.690> so<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:10.860> yeah<00:02:11.790> look

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
travel and stop it like so and yeah look

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.730 
travel and stop it like so and yeah look
on<00:02:12.750> off

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
on off

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.870 
on off
quick<00:02:14.610> pulses<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.630> then<00:02:15.840> now<00:02:15.960> it'll<00:02:16.110> just<00:02:16.350> do

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
quick pulses and then now it'll just do

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.610 
quick pulses and then now it'll just do
on/off<00:02:17.880> kind<00:02:18.150> of<00:02:18.240> thing<00:02:18.390> so<00:02:18.900> it<00:02:19.080> reacts<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.590> a

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
on/off kind of thing so it reacts to a

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.890 
on/off kind of thing so it reacts to a
lot<00:02:19.830> of<00:02:19.860> different<00:02:20.010> things<00:02:20.460> happening<00:02:20.970> you

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
lot of different things happening you

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.870 
lot of different things happening you
can<00:02:22.050> place<00:02:22.230> redstone<00:02:22.500> dust<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.220> it'll<00:02:23.400> will

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
can place redstone dust and it'll will

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.310 
can place redstone dust and it'll will
activate<00:02:24.360> it<00:02:26.480> it<00:02:27.480> could<00:02:27.690> be<00:02:27.780> anything<00:02:28.020> kind

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
activate it it could be anything kind

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.440 
activate it it could be anything kind
like<00:02:28.410> a<00:02:28.500> furnace<00:02:28.770> a<00:02:29.040> furnace<00:02:29.370> updates<00:02:30.210> the

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
like a furnace a furnace updates the

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.220 
like a furnace a furnace updates the
block<00:02:30.660> whenever<00:02:31.170> it's<00:02:31.410> lit<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:31.920> unlit<00:02:32.780> so<00:02:33.780> for

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
block whenever it's lit and unlit so for

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.160 
block whenever it's lit and unlit so for
example<00:02:34.290> let's<00:02:35.030> see<00:02:36.030> what<00:02:36.210> puts<00:02:36.630> something<00:02:36.900> in

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
example let's see what puts something in

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:44.000 
example let's see what puts something in
there<00:02:37.320> to<00:02:37.410> cook<00:02:38.390> pick<00:02:39.390> this<00:02:39.570> stuff<00:02:39.750> I<00:02:43.010> will

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
there to cook pick this stuff I will

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.590 
there to cook pick this stuff I will
make<00:02:44.160> some<00:02:44.190> die<00:02:46.940> alright<00:02:47.940> so<00:02:48.120> like<00:02:48.270> right<00:02:48.420> now

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
make some die alright so like right now

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.240 
make some die alright so like right now
see<00:02:48.810> it<00:02:48.930> updated<00:02:49.320> because<00:02:49.440> it<00:02:49.710> changed<00:02:50.010> into

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
see it updated because it changed into

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.790 
see it updated because it changed into
the<00:02:50.370> kind<00:02:50.610> of<00:02:50.760> lit<00:02:51.300> up<00:02:51.420> furnace<00:02:51.840> so<00:02:52.620> whenever

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
the kind of lit up furnace so whenever

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.430 
the kind of lit up furnace so whenever
that<00:02:53.280> fire<00:02:54.090> burns<00:02:54.420> out<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:54.900> it<00:02:54.960> goes<00:02:55.110> into<00:02:55.290> an

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
that fire burns out and it goes into an

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.720 
that fire burns out and it goes into an
unlit<00:02:55.770> for<00:02:55.950> Anna's<00:02:56.130> that'll<00:02:56.340> count<00:02:56.520> as<00:02:56.610> a

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
unlit for Anna's that'll count as a

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.910 
unlit for Anna's that'll count as a
block<00:02:56.910> update<00:02:57.300> and<00:02:57.510> then<00:02:58.320> it'll<00:02:58.530> make<00:02:58.710> you
