purpose in life I think there's

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
purpose in life I think there's
something<00:02:54.920> deep<00:02:55.610> inside<00:02:55.880> her<00:02:56.420> that's<00:02:56.930> asleep

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
something deep inside her that's asleep

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.970 
something deep inside her that's asleep
that's<00:02:58.520> there<00:02:59.240> that<00:02:59.930> she<00:03:00.110> acknowledges<00:03:00.740> and

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
that's there that she acknowledges and

that's there that she acknowledges and
you<00:03:01.130> see<00:03:01.310> her<00:03:01.430> start<00:03:01.700> to<00:03:01.760> acknowledge<00:03:02.270> it

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
you see her start to acknowledge it

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.600 
you see her start to acknowledge it
certainly<00:03:03.110> when<00:03:03.530> she's<00:03:03.770> thrown<00:03:04.250> in<00:03:04.430> with<00:03:04.550> a

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
certainly when she's thrown in with a

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.030 
certainly when she's thrown in with a
Dothraki<00:03:04.790> and<00:03:05.540> she's<00:03:06.320> presented<00:03:06.800> with<00:03:06.920> the
