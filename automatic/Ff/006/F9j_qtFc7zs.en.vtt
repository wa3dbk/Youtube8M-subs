break which will precipitate proteins

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.310 
break which will precipitate proteins
and<00:00:32.759> also<00:00:33.390> get<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.870> wort<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.260> temperature

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
and also get the wort to a temperature

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.560 
and also get the wort to a temperature
at<00:00:34.950> which<00:00:34.980> we<00:00:35.370> can<00:00:35.579> mix<00:00:35.790> in<00:00:36.000> our<00:00:36.059> yeast<00:00:36.120> as

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
at which we can mix in our yeast as

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.389 
at which we can mix in our yeast as
quickly<00:00:36.719> as<00:00:37.050> we<00:00:37.140> can<00:00:37.380> so<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.739> yeast<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:38.190> the

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
quickly as we can so the yeast of the

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.310 
quickly as we can so the yeast of the
best<00:00:38.640> chance<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:39.090> establishing<00:00:39.300> itself<00:00:39.870> as

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
best chance of establishing itself as

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.340 
best chance of establishing itself as
the<00:00:40.590> dominant<00:00:41.040> microbe<00:00:41.219> in<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.820> wort<00:00:42.350> while

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
the dominant microbe in the wort while

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.779 
the dominant microbe in the wort while
I'm<00:00:43.500> doing<00:00:43.770> this<00:00:43.890> I'm<00:00:44.129> stirring<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.760> water

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
I'm doing this I'm stirring the water

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.810 
I'm doing this I'm stirring the water
around<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.780> pot<00:00:45.989> in<00:00:46.500> order<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.190> break<00:00:47.280> up<00:00:47.640> the

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
around the pot in order to break up the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.459 
around the pot in order to break up the
boundary<00:00:48.149> layer<00:00:48.239> that's<00:00:48.390> forming<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:49.289> hot

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
boundary layer that's forming of hot

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.160 
boundary layer that's forming of hot
water<00:00:50.090> also<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.149> can<00:00:51.420> kind<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.780> give<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.140> pot

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
water also you can kind of give the pot

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.959 
water also you can kind of give the pot
a<00:00:52.770> little<00:00:52.860> stir<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.460> breaks<00:00:53.579> up<00:00:53.940> the

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
a little stir and that breaks up the

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.670 
a little stir and that breaks up the
boundary<00:00:54.300> layer<00:00:54.480> on<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.690> inside<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:55.199> this

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
boundary layer on the inside so this

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.500 
boundary layer on the inside so this
will<00:00:55.739> encourage<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:56.489> cooler<00:00:56.699> slope<00:00:57.180> or<00:00:57.449> a

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
will encourage a cooler slope or a

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.549 
will encourage a cooler slope or a
faster<00:00:58.109> cooling<00:00:59.870> while<00:01:00.870> you're<00:01:01.079> waiting<00:01:01.350> for

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
faster cooling while you're waiting for

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.410 
faster cooling while you're waiting for
your<00:01:01.680> wort<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:02.039> chill<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.850> may<00:01:02.879> want<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.239> get<00:01:03.359> a

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
your wort to chill you may want to get a

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.000 
your wort to chill you may want to get a
head<00:01:03.629> start<00:01:03.809> on<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.290> next<00:01:04.350> step<00:01:04.710> which<00:01:04.979> is

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
head start on the next step which is

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.969 
head start on the next step which is
yeast<00:01:05.309> preparation<00:01:06.590> since<00:01:07.590> we<00:01:07.770> put<00:01:07.950> in

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
yeast preparation since we put in

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.649 
yeast preparation since we put in
steeping<00:01:08.100> ups<00:01:08.700> we're<00:01:09.030> going<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.210> need<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.479> take

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
steeping ups we're going to need to take

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.149 
steeping ups we're going to need to take
those<00:01:09.840> out<00:01:10.049> before<00:01:10.290> we<00:01:10.500> mix<00:01:10.590> them<00:01:10.920> with<00:01:11.040> our

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
those out before we mix them with our

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.770 
those out before we mix them with our
water<00:01:11.220> so<00:01:11.850> we're<00:01:12.000> going<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.150> go<00:01:12.330> take<00:01:12.600> our

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
water so we're going to go take our

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.210 
water so we're going to go take our
tongs<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.409> go<00:01:13.500> put<00:01:13.680> them<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.070> our

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
tongs and go put them in our

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.219 
tongs and go put them in our
sanitization<00:01:14.600> solutions<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:15.869> they<00:01:15.990> will<00:01:16.140> be

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
sanitization solutions so they will be

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.600 
sanitization solutions so they will be
nice<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.439> clean<00:01:16.740> before<00:01:17.100> we<00:01:17.340> need<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.520> use

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
nice and clean before we need to use

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.120 
nice and clean before we need to use
them<00:01:18.229> while<00:01:19.229> we're<00:01:19.380> waiting<00:01:19.650> for<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.950> cool

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
them while we're waiting for it to cool

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.530 
them while we're waiting for it to cool
we're<00:01:20.520> going<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.700> start<00:01:20.909> filling<00:01:21.150> our<00:01:21.360> bucket

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
we're going to start filling our bucket

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.440 
we're going to start filling our bucket
up<00:01:21.840> with<00:01:21.869> some<00:01:22.049> nice<00:01:22.320> cold<00:01:22.380> water<00:01:22.939> now<00:01:23.939> with

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
up with some nice cold water now with

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.219 
up with some nice cold water now with
these<00:01:24.630> buckets<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:26.390> typically<00:01:27.390> represents

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
these buckets this typically represents

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.289 
these buckets this typically represents
the<00:01:28.259> halfway<00:01:28.470> mark<00:01:29.100> or<00:01:29.310> I'm<00:01:29.759> sorry<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.090> five

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
the halfway mark or I'm sorry the five

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.210 
the halfway mark or I'm sorry the five
gallon<00:01:30.360> mark<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.470> we're<00:01:31.799> going<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:31.979> start

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
gallon mark so we're going to start

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.770 
gallon mark so we're going to start
filling<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.670> roughly<00:01:32.850> two<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.600> half

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
filling it to roughly two and a half

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.210 
filling it to roughly two and a half
gallons<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.439> then<00:01:34.500> we're<00:01:34.650> going<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.799> top<00:01:35.009> off

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
gallons and then we're going to top off

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.429 
gallons and then we're going to top off
with<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.000> wort<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.600> then<00:01:36.659> whatever<00:01:36.930> else<00:01:37.320> we

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
with the wort and then whatever else we

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.289 
with the wort and then whatever else we
need<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.770> get<00:01:37.950> just<00:01:38.189> above<00:01:38.430> five<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.270> half

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
need to get just above five and a half

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.469
