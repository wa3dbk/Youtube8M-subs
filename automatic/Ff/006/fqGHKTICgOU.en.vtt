00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.690
 this poem on Sunday in the throat 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.690
 roberto zurda 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.359
 poet and journalist 

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:13.589
 his book is called my way 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:17.960
 no doubt the throat is a poem written by Robert in 99 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:23.599
 when my racing was torn between disappearing or remaining as an entity 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:25.480
 of Argentine soccer 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.619
 finally recovered and in December 2001 he was champion of first 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.469
 after 35 years but that's another story 1 min in the throat when the 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:38.270
 racing fans were desperate 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.200
 roberto surra 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.000
 wrote this 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.280
 dedicated to july 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.350
 that rajoy in genoa 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.580
 keen and rajiv are left 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.800
 and after that 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.730
 just thinking about it my throat is tied what we do with so many illusions 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.870
 transferred to the second half the next game to the preseason oo 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.300
 to the other championship 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.490
 what will we do with rovito on sunday without sun and racing we have left 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.380
 that without sadness the little sadness that is already tradition the soul 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.790
 if suddenly he drove a day before the infinite abyss that racing no longer 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:16.900
 is 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.100
 what will we do with that goal of the chango that goal came samour immense proletarian 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.000
 imperfect 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.180
 that does not even approach us 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.130
 if the photo of the volt will be and that of the marshal and we will fall out of old 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.460
 what will we do with the drowned and minga cries of Syrian laburo and the future 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.770
 if our horizons are here just and 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.740
 no works and we have left 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.660
 what to do with hope 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.430
 where will the dreams of champion we speculate of pibes with July 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.060
 hitting the octopus 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.649
 the old placita martín fierro de la rioja y vuelta 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.830
 or when it's great success we used to stay 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.520
 in those twilight of the old paris café fleeing to exhaustion the 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.750
 chair of ibarra de tulio and de josé 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.449
 speaking of a man if he gives me a pedro of art six of the sacrosanct names 

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:12.619
 of orest and soil 

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:14.629
 where will the words go 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:18.659
 with which he overwhelmed Rovito by telling of the dreams of troubles half a day 

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:24.079
 buildable presented with goal direction and we find it absurd 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:28.929
 The sun of the 60s was more beautiful with controls in French and Fridays in family 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:31.640
 without so much survey 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.209
 sacrifice of chile 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.929
 that excited with you general 

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:37.959
 and racing that was partying 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.560
 as well now of racing films could no longer be no 

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:46.139
 that call us all the mola collecting water to the imperial will not deny is estimated 

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:50.109
 refuse a stretch of the coin all we need to do recitals for 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:53.120
 racing let's write a book for racing 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.049
 let's sell stamps I remember that center 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.110
 let's ask for each one of us in the street what we can all 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.299
 let's stop smoking let's go to the movies 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.649
 enough of a pool and invoice on Sunday 

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:10.859
 let's not let racing go away without fighting and do not come with that you can not 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.569
 minute in the throat just give 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.709
 to the championship goal shouted to amazement 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.359
 with my firm on the back 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:25.680
 and in the magic corner we make tie art
