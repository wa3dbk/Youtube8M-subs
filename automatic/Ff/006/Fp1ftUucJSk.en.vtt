everything<00:03:26.470> about<00:03:26.590> them<00:03:27.010> I<00:03:27.220> think<00:03:27.459> they're<00:03:27.580> an

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
everything about them I think they're an

everything about them I think they're an
awesome<00:03:27.850> brand<00:03:28.269> and<00:03:28.480> the<00:03:28.540> other<00:03:28.720> thing<00:03:28.989> that's

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
awesome brand and the other thing that's

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.570 
awesome brand and the other thing that's
great<00:03:29.290> is<00:03:29.410> when<00:03:29.680> you<00:03:29.769> buy<00:03:29.920> a<00:03:29.950> pair<00:03:30.250> of<00:03:30.370> glasses

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
great is when you buy a pair of glasses

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.850 
great is when you buy a pair of glasses
they<00:03:31.300> give<00:03:31.540> a<00:03:31.570> pair<00:03:31.900> to<00:03:31.959> someone<00:03:32.590> in<00:03:32.709> need

which is amazing

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.550 
which is amazing
so<00:03:35.500> I<00:03:35.530> think<00:03:35.650> that<00:03:36.100> the<00:03:36.430> brand<00:03:36.760> was<00:03:36.940> started<00:03:37.330> by

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
so I think that the brand was started by

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.340 
so I think that the brand was started by
the<00:03:38.560> MBA<00:03:39.489> students<00:03:40.090> some<00:03:40.239> guys<00:03:40.420> who<00:03:41.200> had<00:03:41.320> a

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
the MBA students some guys who had a

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.090 
the MBA students some guys who had a
passion<00:03:41.739> for<00:03:41.769> glasses<00:03:42.130> and<00:03:42.580> so<00:03:43.420> they<00:03:44.100> they

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
passion for glasses and so they they

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.979 
passion for glasses and so they they
made<00:03:45.250> the<00:03:45.430> lenses<00:03:45.820> or<00:03:46.269> they<00:03:46.450> you<00:03:46.780> know<00:03:46.870> they

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
made the lenses or they you know they

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.350 
made the lenses or they you know they
created<00:03:47.320> the<00:03:47.410> brand<00:03:47.640> and<00:03:48.640> so<00:03:48.700> now<00:03:49.090> they're

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
created the brand and so now they're

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.390

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:28.050 
from them because they are being
annoying<00:05:26.440> so<00:05:27.219> you<00:05:27.279> get<00:05:27.460> your<00:05:27.550> prescription

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
annoying so you get your prescription

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.159 
annoying so you get your prescription
and<00:05:28.180> you<00:05:28.240> type<00:05:28.449> it<00:05:28.599> in<00:05:28.719> when<00:05:28.900> you're<00:05:29.020> ordering

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
and you type it in when you're ordering

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:32.519 
and you type it in when you're ordering
your<00:05:29.440> glasses<00:05:29.650> and<00:05:30.159> then<00:05:31.050> there's<00:05:32.050> one<00:05:32.319> thing

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:32.529 
your glasses and then there's one thing

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:34.260 
your glasses and then there's one thing
that<00:05:32.710> you<00:05:32.800> need<00:05:32.979> to<00:05:33.009> do<00:05:33.310> you<00:05:33.819> need<00:05:33.909> to<00:05:34.029> make

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
that you need to do you need to make

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.059 
that you need to do you need to make
sure<00:05:34.300> you<00:05:34.629> have<00:05:34.810> your<00:05:34.960> PD<00:05:35.469> measured<00:05:35.889> and

00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:36.069 
sure you have your PD measured and

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:38.159 
sure you have your PD measured and
that's<00:05:36.219> your<00:05:36.370> pupillary<00:05:36.909> distance<00:05:37.330> and<00:05:37.750> I

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:38.169 
that's your pupillary distance and I

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:39.629 
that's your pupillary distance and I
think<00:05:38.440> that's<00:05:38.620> just<00:05:38.740> a<00:05:38.889> measurement<00:05:39.190> of<00:05:39.430> like

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:39.639 
think that's just a measurement of like

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:42.300 
think that's just a measurement of like
from<00:05:40.240> your<00:05:40.419> pupil<00:05:40.810> to<00:05:41.529> the<00:05:41.620> outside<00:05:42.039> of<00:05:42.190> your

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
from your pupil to the outside of your

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.219 
from your pupil to the outside of your
eyes<00:05:42.550> or<00:05:43.029> just<00:05:43.060> the<00:05:43.750> measurement<00:05:44.110> of<00:05:44.199> your

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:44.229 
eyes or just the measurement of your

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:46.019 
eyes or just the measurement of your
people<00:05:44.560> something<00:05:44.740> like<00:05:44.979> that<00:05:45.159> but<00:05:45.669> they<00:05:45.849> need

00:05:46.019 --> 00:05:46.029 
people something like that but they need

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:48.209 
people something like that but they need
it<00:05:46.150> to<00:05:46.180> be<00:05:46.270> able<00:05:46.449> to<00:05:46.569> fit<00:05:46.900> your<00:05:47.020> glasses<00:05:47.349> before

00:05:58.079 --> 00:05:58.089 
the optometrists office can be a little

00:05:58.089 --> 00:06:00.990 
the optometrists office can be a little
bit<00:05:58.449> hard<00:05:59.349> to<00:05:59.529> get<00:05:59.770> from<00:06:00.069> them<00:06:00.219> because<00:06:00.819> the

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
bit hard to get from them because the

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.519 
bit hard to get from them because the
problem<00:06:01.360> is<00:06:01.479> they<00:06:01.629> obviously<00:06:01.870> want<00:06:02.259> to<00:06:02.349> sell

00:06:02.519 --> 00:06:02.529

problem is they obviously want to sell
you<00:06:02.650> glasses<00:06:03.069> and<00:06:03.279> they<00:06:03.430> know<00:06:03.580> if<00:06:03.699> you're

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:03.789 
you glasses and they know if you're

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:05.879 
you glasses and they know if you're
asking<00:06:03.969> for<00:06:04.270> your<00:06:04.569> PD<00:06:04.900> that<00:06:05.439> you're<00:06:05.589> gonna<00:06:05.710> buy

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:05.889 
asking for your PD that you're gonna buy

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:07.110 
asking for your PD that you're gonna buy
them<00:06:06.069> online<00:06:06.189> so<00:06:06.610> they<00:06:06.699> don't<00:06:06.819> really<00:06:06.909> like

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
them online so they don't really like

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.110 
them online so they don't really like
that<00:06:07.180> so<00:06:07.569> the<00:06:08.139> first<00:06:08.379> place<00:06:08.770> that<00:06:08.860> I<00:06:09.129> they<00:06:09.879> went

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
that so the first place that I they went

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.320 
that so the first place that I they went
to<00:06:10.300> they<00:06:10.509> wouldn't<00:06:10.750> measure<00:06:11.020> it<00:06:11.169> for<00:06:11.349> me<00:06:11.500> and
