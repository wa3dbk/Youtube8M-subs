00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.599
 the one who waves to everyone speaks to them mark mex 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.599
 and little eyes that coming out then I 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:15.519
 kill ok good guys we are in the 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:17.590
 episode number 1 of the road to 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:20.590
 bombed that make it a streak 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.840
 nuclear against all and good I had 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:26.890
 than recover this game from the mode 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:29.019
 cinema since I had this video recorded to the 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.599
 time to play it like that with comment 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:33.400
 live and the whole thing but once again the 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.370
 sony vegas did his things and I did not 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.230
 he wanted to recognize the original video because 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.540
 well, the video appeared in green 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.250
 when I wanted to edit it in sony vegas 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.170
 and then it can not be reproduced and much 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.450
 less render so if someone knows 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.430
 how to fix this I will be 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.740
 eternally grateful to be told 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.110
 how and how good you guys can see the 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.570
 video lasts less than three minutes and 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.940
 maybe you wonder why good 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.970
 boys only reason is that they 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.280
 I bring the streak of 10 then also 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.579
 known as ruthless and I decided 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.360
 bring only the streak because 

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:09.490
 the match 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.980
 it lasted a little more than 7 minutes 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.320
 but the compadres he was with 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:17.350
 playing at the end they put a 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.880
 changed but of those and it was that way 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.800
 be looking for enemies for two 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.870
 minutes spinning around the map and 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.880
 Suddenly a kid killed you and like that and 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.340
 I decided to bring them the best streak 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.650
 because the full game if it's going to be 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.630
 quite quite monotonous as I say 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:35.050
 especially at the end fortunately win 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.330
 the game but let's say no or not 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.759
 it was too useful to bring them the 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.290
 entire game and I do not know if they want 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:44.320
 the next episodes are like this 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.750
 this daring where only the 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.180
 streak of which I plan that by 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.830
 each episode is increasing by 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.440
 example I already have choice number two with 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.540
 the inexorable streak or 15 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.710
 that almost reached the 20's but if you guys 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.050
 I do not know if they prefer episodes 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.600
 just from the streak or that 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:06.009
 they put the whole game complete eye 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.640
 eye here I kill him and we 're going forward 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:11.210
 guys will see what 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.280
 shake right here I take out the orbital and 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:16.370
 do loading cycle I say better 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.650
 I will go back very well, mark next and good 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.209
 guys because only because they 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.910
 I would ask you to leave your opinions in the 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.410
 comments if they would like it to be 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.900
 just from the streak or whatever it was 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.520
 the full game with live commentary 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.650
 and the whole thing so well then nothing 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.790
 guys up here to finish the 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.590
 departure I hope you liked it
