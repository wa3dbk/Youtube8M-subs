with all the wet weather we've been

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.910 
with all the wet weather we've been
having<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.660> ground<00:00:15.900> gets<00:00:16.109> very<00:00:16.260> waterlogged

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
having the ground gets very waterlogged

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.040 
having the ground gets very waterlogged
if<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.550> lawns<00:00:17.760> often<00:00:18.119> get<00:00:18.240> compacted<00:00:18.840> in<00:00:18.930> the

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
if the lawns often get compacted in the

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.920 
if the lawns often get compacted in the
summer<00:00:19.320> so<00:00:19.650> autumn<00:00:20.460> winter<00:00:20.699> early<00:00:21.060> spring<00:00:21.480> are

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
summer so autumn winter early spring are

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.109 
summer so autumn winter early spring are
great<00:00:22.170> times<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.800> relieve<00:00:23.400> that<00:00:23.670> compaction

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
great times to relieve that compaction

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.390 
great times to relieve that compaction
get<00:00:24.720> better<00:00:24.930> drainage<00:00:25.230> in<00:00:25.619> so<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.220> water

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
get better drainage in so the water

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.250 
get better drainage in so the water
drains<00:00:26.640> away<00:00:26.910> loose<00:00:27.510> root<00:00:27.779> growth<00:00:28.080> and

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
drains away loose root growth and

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.109 
drains away loose root growth and
improve<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.769> lawn<00:00:28.949> enormous<00:00:29.490> things<00:00:29.730> so<00:00:29.970> what

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
improve the lawn enormous things so what

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.659 
improve the lawn enormous things so what
we<00:00:30.240> need<00:00:30.420> for<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.720> job<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.460> barrel<00:00:32.460> full<00:00:32.610> of

we need for the job is a barrel full of
compost<00:00:33.300> what<00:00:33.510> I've<00:00:33.630> used<00:00:33.660> is<00:00:34.020> old<00:00:34.200> potting

the old potting compost as I've used

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.229 
the old potting compost as I've used
what<00:00:46.800> this<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.129> doing<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.550> improving<00:00:47.910> the

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
what this is doing is improving the

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.180 
what this is doing is improving the
drainage<00:00:48.690> in<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.989> soil<00:00:49.289> will<00:00:49.590> feed<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.010> lawn

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
drainage in the soil will feed the lawn

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.310 
drainage in the soil will feed the lawn
later<00:00:50.430> so<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.300> food<00:00:51.539> aliments<00:00:51.960> not<00:00:52.140> so

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
later so the food aliments not so

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.630 
later so the food aliments not so
important<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:52.860> just<00:00:52.890> about<00:00:53.160> getting<00:00:53.460> that

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
important is just about getting that

away from the roots of the plant you

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.209 
away from the roots of the plant you
also<00:00:57.600> need<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.870> long<00:00:58.140> rake<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.530> clear<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.859> top

a broom to sweep it in I'll get going in
show<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.650> our<00:01:16.799> ago

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.890 

what<00:01:32.010> will<00:01:32.130> we<00:01:32.160> gonna<00:01:32.340> do<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.420> drive<00:01:33.690> the

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
what will we gonna do is to drive the

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.630 
what will we gonna do is to drive the
tines<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.260> the<00:01:34.320> fork<00:01:34.620> in<00:01:34.830> about<00:01:35.040> three<00:01:35.370> to<00:01:35.400> four

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
tines of the fork in about three to four

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.470 
tines of the fork in about three to four
inches<00:01:36.000> deep<00:01:36.320> okay<00:01:37.970> give<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.120> good<00:01:39.210> wiggle

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:39.480 
inches deep okay give it a good wiggle

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.350 
inches deep okay give it a good wiggle
around<00:01:39.570> move<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:40.650> forward<00:01:40.980> six<00:01:41.250> inches<00:01:41.610> and

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
around move it forward six inches and

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.560 
around move it forward six inches and
again<00:01:42.660> so<00:01:43.620> what<00:01:43.770> we<00:01:43.890> end<00:01:44.010> up<00:01:44.100> with<00:01:44.160> is<00:01:44.430> rows<00:01:45.330> and

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
again so what we end up with is rows and

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.120 
again so what we end up with is rows and
rows<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.990> these<00:01:46.080> little<00:01:46.380> hold<00:01:46.590> right<00:01:46.920> across

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
rows of these little hold right across

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.580 
rows of these little hold right across
the<00:01:47.400> lawn<00:01:47.580> and<00:01:48.540> we<00:01:48.690> do<00:01:48.840> which<00:01:48.990> we<00:01:49.140> brush<00:01:49.440> the

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
the lawn and we do which we brush the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.640 
the lawn and we do which we brush the
compost<00:01:50.120> it's<00:01:51.120> much<00:01:51.690> easier<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.140> do<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.470> after

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
compost it's much easier to do it after

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.620 
compost it's much easier to do it after
it's<00:01:52.950> been<00:01:53.490> raining<00:01:53.760> in<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.090> grounds<00:01:54.420> nice

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
it's been raining in the grounds nice

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.600 
it's been raining in the grounds nice
and<00:01:54.870> moist<00:01:55.080> that<00:01:55.350> font<00:01:55.590> goes<00:01:55.770> in<00:01:56.010> so<00:01:56.250> much<00:01:56.370> more

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
and moist that font goes in so much more

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.150 
and moist that font goes in so much more
easily<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.690> the<00:01:57.810> other<00:01:57.960> thing<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.350> do<00:01:58.920> watch

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
easily and the other thing is do watch

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.900 
easily and the other thing is do watch
your<00:01:59.430> feet

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910

that and be a helluva a painful way to

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.880 
that and be a helluva a painful way to
work<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.700> end<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.330> day's<00:02:06.480> work<00:02:06.840> so<00:02:07.500> where<00:02:07.710> some

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
work to end the day's work so where some

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.000 
work to end the day's work so where some
good<00:02:08.070> stout<00:02:08.340> boots<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:09.030> be<00:02:09.270> careful<00:02:10.010> I'm

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 
good stout boots and be careful I'm

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:12.710 
good stout boots and be careful I'm
using<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.460> fork<00:02:11.670> backwards<00:02:12.150> quite<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.420> lot<00:02:12.630> at

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
using the fork backwards quite a lot at

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.720 
using the fork backwards quite a lot at
the<00:02:12.810> time<00:02:12.840> like<00:02:13.230> this<00:02:13.410> and<00:02:14.190> that's<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.490> upper

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
the time like this and that's the upper

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.060 
the time like this and that's the upper
tines<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.150> go<00:02:15.270> straight<00:02:15.660> into<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:16.020> ground<00:02:16.410> if

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
tines to go straight into the ground if

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.190 
tines to go straight into the ground if
you<00:02:17.370> were<00:02:17.550> push<00:02:18.090> it<00:02:18.240> this<00:02:18.360> way<00:02:18.420> you<00:02:18.930> see<00:02:19.050> it

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
you were push it this way you see it

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.380 
you were push it this way you see it
tends<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:19.590> get<00:02:19.770> a<00:02:19.830> bit<00:02:19.920> on<00:02:20.130> angle<00:02:20.490> so<00:02:20.700> that's

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
tends to get a bit on angle so that's

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.340 
tends to get a bit on angle so that's
quite<00:02:21.750> a<00:02:21.780> good<00:02:22.940> approach<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.750> problem

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
quite a good approach to the problem

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.910 
quite a good approach to the problem
if<00:02:25.830> only<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.190> made<00:02:26.310> it<00:02:26.460> much<00:02:26.610> easier<00:02:27.740> okay<00:02:28.740> I'll

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
if only it made it much easier okay I'll

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.350 
if only it made it much easier okay I'll
get<00:02:29.040> on<00:02:29.190> with<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.430> job<00:02:29.610> now<00:02:29.850> and<00:02:30.000> I'll<00:02:30.090> talk<00:02:30.300> to

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
get on with the job now and I'll talk to

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:47.620 
get on with the job now and I'll talk to
you<00:02:30.510> later

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:58.780 

sorry

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.640 

okay<00:02:59.790> so<00:02:59.850> the<00:03:00.090> whole<00:03:00.330> lawn<00:03:00.630> now<00:03:00.930> is<00:03:01.110> being

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
okay so the whole lawn now is being

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.120 
okay so the whole lawn now is being
spiked<00:03:02.040> two<00:03:02.280> three<00:03:02.940> four<00:03:03.180> inches<00:03:03.480> deep<00:03:03.720> with<00:03:03.900> a

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
spiked two three four inches deep with a

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.040 
spiked two three four inches deep with a
spike<00:03:05.130> to<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.370> fork<00:03:05.670> which<00:03:06.360> will<00:03:06.570> help<00:03:06.780> to

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
spike to the fork which will help to

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.870 
spike to the fork which will help to
water<00:03:07.350> to<00:03:07.620> drain<00:03:07.830> away<00:03:07.890> from<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.340> surface<00:03:08.730> of

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
water to drain away from the surface of

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.700 
water to drain away from the surface of
the<00:03:09.000> of<00:03:09.240> the<00:03:09.330> grass<00:03:09.540> that<00:03:09.900> should<00:03:10.410> help<00:03:10.620> the

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
the of the grass that should help the

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:12.350 
the of the grass that should help the
roots<00:03:10.920> to<00:03:11.100> grow<00:03:11.190> better<00:03:11.460> it<00:03:11.730> should<00:03:11.790> keep<00:03:12.030> moss

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
roots to grow better it should keep moss

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.170 
roots to grow better it should keep moss
off<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.690> surface<00:03:13.170> it'll<00:03:13.710> generally

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
off the surface it'll generally

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.220 
off the surface it'll generally
revitalize<00:03:15.180> them<00:03:15.420> all<00:03:15.540> but<00:03:15.780> to<00:03:15.900> stop<00:03:16.110> all

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
revitalize them all but to stop all

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.740 
revitalize them all but to stop all
those<00:03:16.380> holes<00:03:16.650> closing<00:03:17.580> up<00:03:17.730> what<00:03:18.270> I<00:03:18.300> now<00:03:18.510> need

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
those holes closing up what I now need

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.140 
those holes closing up what I now need
to<00:03:18.780> do<00:03:19.050> is<00:03:19.440> brush<00:03:19.800> compost<00:03:20.400> into<00:03:20.580> the<00:03:20.670> surface

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
to do is brush compost into the surface

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.030 
to do is brush compost into the surface
so<00:03:21.300> it<00:03:21.390> drops<00:03:21.570> down<00:03:21.630> the<00:03:21.930> holes<00:03:22.110> keeps<00:03:22.860> them

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
so it drops down the holes keeps them

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.800 
so it drops down the holes keeps them
open<00:03:23.160> so<00:03:23.520> the<00:03:23.640> drainage<00:03:24.000> stays<00:03:24.300> really<00:03:24.600> good

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
open so the drainage stays really good

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:51.790 
open so the drainage stays really good
I'll<00:03:24.930> show<00:03:24.960> you<00:03:25.170> how<00:03:25.230> to<00:03:25.290> do<00:03:25.470> that<00:03:25.590> now

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.460 

don't<00:03:52.800> worry<00:03:53.010> too<00:03:53.190> much<00:03:53.220> about<00:03:53.430> that

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
don't worry too much about that

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.390 
don't worry too much about that
brown-skinned<00:03:55.470> of<00:03:55.560> compost<00:03:56.040> over<00:03:56.190> the

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
brown-skinned of compost over the

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.040 
brown-skinned of compost over the
surface<00:03:56.819> the<00:03:56.970> rain<00:03:57.180> will<00:03:57.360> soon<00:03:57.569> wash<00:03:57.810> that

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
surface the rain will soon wash that

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.809 
surface the rain will soon wash that
into<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.379> ground<00:03:58.650> the<00:03:58.890> grass<00:03:59.129> will<00:03:59.370> grow<00:03:59.400> away

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
into the ground the grass will grow away

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.119 
into the ground the grass will grow away
and<00:03:59.970> it<00:04:00.030> will<00:04:00.090> look<00:04:00.209> fine<00:04:00.510> in<00:04:01.230> a<00:04:01.290> few<00:04:01.319> days<00:04:01.500> no

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:02.129 
and it will look fine in a few days no

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:02.540 
and it will look fine in a few days no

this<00:04:03.420> is<00:04:03.569> not<00:04:04.349> a<00:04:04.379> particularly<00:04:04.860> wonderfully

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
this is not a particularly wonderfully

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.130 
this is not a particularly wonderfully
conditioned<00:04:06.000> lawn<00:04:06.180> and<00:04:06.420> I<00:04:06.480> do<00:04:06.540> this<00:04:06.810> every

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
conditioned lawn and I do this every

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.350 
conditioned lawn and I do this every
year<00:04:07.170> it's<00:04:08.160> absolutely<00:04:08.610> essential<00:04:08.849> this<00:04:09.180> is

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
year it's absolutely essential this is

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.880 
year it's absolutely essential this is
quite<00:04:09.540> a<00:04:09.569> shaded<00:04:10.050> garden<00:04:10.440> it's<00:04:10.560> north-facing

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
quite a shaded garden it's north-facing

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.850 
quite a shaded garden it's north-facing
it's<00:04:11.489> got<00:04:11.640> high<00:04:11.880> boundary<00:04:12.390> walls<00:04:12.860> several

it's got high boundary walls several

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.620 
it's got high boundary walls several
trees<00:04:14.160> in<00:04:14.370> here<00:04:14.640> so<00:04:14.849> the<00:04:14.970> amount<00:04:15.180> of<00:04:15.269> light<00:04:15.450> the

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630

trees in here so the amount of light the
lawn<00:04:15.750> gets<00:04:16.019> is<00:04:16.229> relatively<00:04:16.680> low<00:04:16.950> because<00:04:17.100> it

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
lawn gets is relatively low because it

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.640 
lawn gets is relatively low because it

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
with this time of year so moss tends to

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.129 
with this time of year so moss tends to

build up and growth is of the grass is

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:24.170 
build up and growth is of the grass is
generally<00:04:22.440> quite<00:04:22.680> weak<00:04:22.919> so<00:04:23.520> to<00:04:23.580> maintain<00:04:23.820> them

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
generally quite weak so to maintain them

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.240 
generally quite weak so to maintain them
all<00:04:24.330> which<00:04:24.510> I<00:04:24.690> really<00:04:25.050> like<00:04:25.200> in<00:04:25.380> a<00:04:25.440> garden<00:04:25.770> but

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
all which I really like in a garden but

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.620 
all which I really like in a garden but
it's<00:04:26.430> quite<00:04:26.639> important<00:04:27.150> to<00:04:27.180> do<00:04:27.360> all<00:04:27.479> these

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
it's quite important to do all these

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.540 
it's quite important to do all these
jobs<00:04:27.990> just<00:04:28.530> to<00:04:28.620> give<00:04:28.770> her<00:04:28.830> the<00:04:28.919> best<00:04:29.100> possible

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
jobs just to give her the best possible

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:36.050 
jobs just to give her the best possible
chance<00:04:33.139> it'll<00:04:34.139> do<00:04:34.740> so<00:04:35.490> that's<00:04:35.639> it

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
chance it'll do so that's it

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.170 
chance it'll do so that's it
I'll<00:04:36.660> carry<00:04:36.960> on<00:04:37.050> earth<00:04:37.340> gets<00:04:38.340> more<00:04:38.550> composter

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180
