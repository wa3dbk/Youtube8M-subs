to start in Reverse

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.810 
to start in Reverse

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.160 
first hopped in the car I kind of knew
the<00:01:43.640> concept<00:01:44.119> of<00:01:44.210> what<00:01:44.360> to<00:01:44.479> do<00:01:44.600> already<00:01:44.869> and

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
the concept of what to do already and

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.399 
the concept of what to do already and
then<00:01:45.770> it<00:01:45.950> was<00:01:46.039> just<00:01:46.070> trying<00:01:46.940> to<00:01:47.060> do<00:01:47.179> it<00:01:47.360> and<00:01:47.570> I

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
then it was just trying to do it and I

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.919 
then it was just trying to do it and I
did<00:01:48.679> pretty<00:01:48.950> well<00:01:49.039> I<00:01:49.429> must<00:01:49.789> say<00:01:49.970> I<00:01:50.210> got<00:01:50.810> to

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
did pretty well I must say I got to

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:53.050 
did pretty well I must say I got to
drive<00:01:51.140> that<00:01:51.289> around<00:01:51.830> a<00:01:51.920> little<00:01:52.039> bit<00:01:52.250> and<00:01:52.490> then

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
drive that around a little bit and then

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.440 
drive that around a little bit and then
when<00:01:53.270> I<00:01:53.300> was<00:01:54.670> 16<00:01:55.670> when<00:01:55.700> I<00:01:55.940> first<00:01:56.179> got<00:01:56.300> my

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
when I was 16 when I first got my

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.899 
when I was 16 when I first got my
license<00:01:56.869> I<00:01:57.049> got<00:01:57.560> my<00:01:57.920> first<00:01:58.159> car<00:01:58.430> which<00:01:58.640> was<00:01:58.850> a

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
license I got my first car which was a

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.560 
license I got my first car which was a
93<00:01:59.810> Camaro<00:02:00.259> and<00:02:00.530> that<00:02:01.399> Camaro<00:02:01.670> was<00:02:01.820> a<00:02:01.880> sixer<00:02:02.390> a

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
93 Camaro and that Camaro was a sixer a

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.810 
93 Camaro and that Camaro was a sixer a
stick<00:02:02.810> shift<00:02:02.990> and<00:02:03.170> I<00:02:03.979> was<00:02:04.130> able<00:02:04.399> to<00:02:04.430> drive<00:02:04.670> that

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
stick shift and I was able to drive that

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.969 
stick shift and I was able to drive that
too<00:02:05.000> so<00:02:05.420> when<00:02:06.049> I<00:02:06.079> got<00:02:06.290> that<00:02:06.500> car

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
too so when I got that car

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.130 
too so when I got that car
I've<00:02:07.040> always<00:02:07.490> obviously<00:02:08.269> a<00:02:08.299> lot<00:02:08.479> newer<00:02:08.720> to<00:02:08.989> it

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
I've always obviously a lot newer to it

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.870 
I've always obviously a lot newer to it
because<00:02:09.290> I<00:02:09.350> haven't<00:02:09.530> really<00:02:09.709> driven<00:02:10.130> my<00:02:10.670> own

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
because I haven't really driven my own

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.410 
because I haven't really driven my own
stick<00:02:11.299> shift<00:02:11.510> ever<00:02:12.260> and<00:02:13.040> when<00:02:13.820> I<00:02:13.850> drove<00:02:14.150> it<00:02:14.299> I

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
stick shift ever and when I drove it I

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.240 
stick shift ever and when I drove it I
was<00:02:14.600> I<00:02:14.810> wouldn't<00:02:15.110> say<00:02:15.230> I<00:02:15.260> was<00:02:15.290> nervous<00:02:15.650> I<00:02:16.040> was

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
was I wouldn't say I was nervous I was

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.060 
was I wouldn't say I was nervous I was
very<00:02:16.519> excited<00:02:17.269> very<00:02:17.450> very<00:02:18.260> excited<00:02:18.739> to<00:02:18.829> do<00:02:18.950> it

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
very excited very very excited to do it

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.569 
very excited very very excited to do it
because<00:02:19.190> I've<00:02:19.820> pretended<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:21.650> drive<00:02:22.070> a<00:02:22.340> stick

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:22.579 
because I've pretended to drive a stick

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:24.100 
because I've pretended to drive a stick
shift<00:02:22.610> for<00:02:22.940> so<00:02:23.150> long<00:02:23.390> and<00:02:23.750> I<00:02:23.840> kind<00:02:24.019> of
