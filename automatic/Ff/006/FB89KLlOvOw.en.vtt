00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
my story I kind of talk about it in my

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.970 
my story I kind of talk about it in my
path<00:00:47.789> atheism<00:00:48.300> video<00:00:48.840> when<00:00:49.469> i<00:00:49.530> was<00:00:49.649> growing<00:00:49.739> up

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
i think the most backlash i received was

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.479 
i think the most backlash i received was
from<00:00:51.930> my<00:00:52.260> dad<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.500> he<00:00:52.949> would<00:00:52.980> just<00:00:53.250> kind<00:00:53.399> of

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
from my dad and he would just kind of

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.880 
from my dad and he would just kind of
make<00:00:53.640> passive-aggressive<00:00:54.510> comments<00:00:54.890> like

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
make passive-aggressive comments like

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.790 
make passive-aggressive comments like
God<00:00:56.250> will<00:00:56.430> strike<00:00:56.520> down<00:00:56.699> on<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.270> one<00:00:57.510> day

from and then as far as my friends

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.490 
from and then as far as my friends
growing<00:01:12.119> up<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.720> would<00:01:13.170> have<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.320> lot<00:01:13.470> of

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
growing up I would have a lot of

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.260 
growing up I would have a lot of
discussions<00:01:14.100> with<00:01:14.310> them<00:01:14.490> about<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:15.030> because

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
discussions with them about it because

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.550 
discussions with them about it because
this<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.600> kind<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.930> going<00:01:16.259> through<00:01:16.380> my

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
this is kind of going through my

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.469 
this is kind of going through my
questioning<00:01:16.979> phase<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:17.880> think<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.390> a

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
questioning phase and I think that of a

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.999 
questioning phase and I think that of a
lot<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.840> other<00:01:18.990> teenagers<00:01:19.560> went<00:01:19.770> through<00:01:19.920> it

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
lot of other teenagers went through it

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.070 
lot of other teenagers went through it
too<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:20.850> think<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:21.119> lot<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.299> people<00:01:21.420> wanted<00:01:21.930> to

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
too so I think a lot of people wanted to

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.840 
too so I think a lot of people wanted to
talk<00:01:22.259> about<00:01:22.290> religion<00:01:22.740> in<00:01:23.040> high<00:01:23.189> school<00:01:23.580> and

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
talk about religion in high school and

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.990 
talk about religion in high school and
my<00:01:24.780> friends<00:01:25.380> didn't<00:01:26.250> really<00:01:26.549> understand

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
my friends didn't really understand

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.060 
my friends didn't really understand
where<00:01:27.150> I'm<00:01:27.240> coming<00:01:27.270> from<00:01:27.630> but<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:28.650> would<00:01:28.890> have

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
where I'm coming from but I would have

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.859 
where I'm coming from but I would have
good<00:01:29.220> discussions<00:01:29.340> with<00:01:30.090> them<00:01:30.299> for<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.659> most

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
good discussions with them for the most

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.780

things<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.369> that<00:01:35.430> nature<00:01:35.579> but<00:01:36.420> it's<00:01:36.540> never

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
things of that nature but it's never

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.240 
things of that nature but it's never
really<00:01:36.930> bothered<00:01:37.170> me<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:37.619> think<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:37.979> kind<00:01:38.130> of

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
really bothered me I think you kind of

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.590 
really bothered me I think you kind of
have<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.460> be<00:01:38.670> tough<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.060> realized<00:01:39.479> that

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
have to be tough and realized that

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.569 
have to be tough and realized that
everybody<00:01:39.990> has<00:01:40.170> their<00:01:40.380> own<00:01:40.409> opinion<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.460> had

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
everybody has their own opinion so I had

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:42.859 
everybody has their own opinion so I had
a<00:01:41.610> lot<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.759> friends<00:01:42.060> in<00:01:42.119> high<00:01:42.270> school<00:01:42.299> that

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
a lot of friends in high school that

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.560 
a lot of friends in high school that
were<00:01:43.380> atheists<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.310> so<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.520> had<00:01:44.880> people<00:01:45.390> to

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
were atheists and so I had people to

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.660 
were atheists and so I had people to
relate<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.350> talk<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.770> about<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:47.640> I

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
relate to and talk to about it and so I

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.520 
relate to and talk to about it and so I
thought<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:47.939> that<00:01:48.180> was<00:01:48.329> always<00:01:48.540> nice<00:01:48.810> really

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
thought that that was always nice really

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.080 
thought that that was always nice really
think<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.890> important<00:01:50.340> thing<00:01:50.399> when<00:01:50.939> you're

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
think the important thing when you're

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.609 
think the important thing when you're
having<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.420> discussion<00:01:51.810> with<00:01:51.990> either<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.350> friend

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
having a discussion with either a friend

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.380 
having a discussion with either a friend
or<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.829> family<00:01:53.009> member<00:01:53.250> about<00:01:53.790> your<00:01:54.119> religion

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
or a family member about your religion

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.810 
or a family member about your religion
or<00:01:54.810> just<00:01:55.020> anything<00:01:55.350> in<00:01:55.680> general<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:56.700> you

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
or just anything in general that you

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.160 
or just anything in general that you
have<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.119> keep<00:01:57.240> an<00:01:57.420> open<00:01:57.540> mind<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:58.020> what

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
have to keep an open mind to what

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.450 
have to keep an open mind to what
they're<00:01:58.380> saying<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.950> really<00:01:59.280> try<00:01:59.430> to

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
they're saying and really try to

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.830 
they're saying and really try to
understand<00:01:59.939> where<00:02:00.090> they're<00:02:00.240> coming<00:02:00.270> from<00:02:00.600> and

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
understand where they're coming from and

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.020 
understand where they're coming from and
why<00:02:01.170> they<00:02:01.380> believe<00:02:01.560> what<00:02:01.829> they<00:02:01.860> believe

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
why they believe what they believe

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.540 
why they believe what they believe
because<00:02:03.030> in<00:02:03.299> my<00:02:03.420> experiences

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
because in my experiences

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.760 
because in my experiences
most<00:02:05.330> of<00:02:05.510> the<00:02:05.660> time<00:02:05.780> people<00:02:06.050> will<00:02:06.320> be<00:02:06.530> much

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
most of the time people will be much

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.570 
most of the time people will be much
more<00:02:07.720> willing<00:02:08.720> and<00:02:09.110> able<00:02:09.260> to<00:02:09.740> listen<00:02:10.160> to<00:02:10.430> your

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
more willing and able to listen to your

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.400 
more willing and able to listen to your
point<00:02:10.790> of<00:02:10.970> view<00:02:11.030> as<00:02:11.270> well<00:02:11.450> and<00:02:11.960> I<00:02:12.050> think<00:02:12.080> that

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
point of view as well and I think that

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:13.900 
point of view as well and I think that
that's<00:02:12.440> what<00:02:13.100> really<00:02:13.340> makes<00:02:13.610> a<00:02:13.790> good

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
that's what really makes a good

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.000 
that's what really makes a good
conversation<00:02:14.720> and<00:02:14.960> hopefully<00:02:15.650> you<00:02:15.800> can<00:02:15.950> learn

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
conversation and hopefully you can learn

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.680 
conversation and hopefully you can learn
something<00:02:16.430> as<00:02:16.880> well<00:02:17.090> as<00:02:17.240> they<00:02:17.360> can<00:02:17.540> learn

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
something as well as they can learn

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.440 
something as well as they can learn
something<00:02:17.960> from<00:02:18.140> both<00:02:18.470> sides<00:02:18.770> I<00:02:19.130> think<00:02:20.030> that

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
something from both sides I think that

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.360 
something from both sides I think that
there's<00:02:21.080> obviously<00:02:21.650> going<00:02:21.890> to<00:02:21.980> be<00:02:22.130> some

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
there's obviously going to be some

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.160 
there's obviously going to be some
people<00:02:22.610> that<00:02:23.030> aren't<00:02:23.540> going<00:02:23.750> to<00:02:23.870> be<00:02:23.990> very

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
people that aren't going to be very

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.560 
people that aren't going to be very
receptive<00:02:24.620> to<00:02:25.010> what<00:02:25.040> you're<00:02:25.280> saying<00:02:25.310> and<00:02:25.820> if

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
receptive to what you're saying and if

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.660 
receptive to what you're saying and if
they<00:02:26.750> aren't<00:02:27.020> very<00:02:27.290> receptive<00:02:27.740> than<00:02:28.190> I<00:02:28.400> just

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
they aren't very receptive than I just

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.730 
they aren't very receptive than I just
say<00:02:28.790> don't<00:02:29.000> talk<00:02:29.210> about<00:02:29.450> religion<00:02:29.720> with<00:02:30.500> them

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
say don't talk about religion with them

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.410 
say don't talk about religion with them
or<00:02:31.010> just<00:02:31.040> don't<00:02:31.550> talk<00:02:31.790> to<00:02:31.820> them<00:02:32.120> in<00:02:32.240> general

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
or just don't talk to them in general

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.210 
or just don't talk to them in general
there's<00:02:33.260> just<00:02:33.500> going<00:02:33.590> to<00:02:33.650> be<00:02:33.740> some<00:02:34.010> people

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
there's just going to be some people

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.790 
there's just going to be some people
that<00:02:34.510> you<00:02:35.510> kind<00:02:35.780> of<00:02:35.870> don't<00:02:36.080> even<00:02:36.530> need<00:02:36.650> to<00:02:36.770> have

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
that you kind of don't even need to have

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.040 
that you kind of don't even need to have
a<00:02:36.950> discussion<00:02:37.040> with<00:02:37.550> I<00:02:38.000> know<00:02:38.330> for<00:02:38.660> me<00:02:38.810> growing

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
a discussion with I know for me growing

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.780 
a discussion with I know for me growing
up<00:02:39.290> it<00:02:39.440> was<00:02:39.470> really<00:02:39.860> important<00:02:40.340> I<00:02:40.400> always<00:02:40.640> felt

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
up it was really important I always felt

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.520 
up it was really important I always felt
like<00:02:40.940> I<00:02:41.090> needed<00:02:41.150> to<00:02:41.390> push<00:02:41.630> my<00:02:41.840> view<00:02:42.080> on<00:02:42.200> others

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
like I needed to push my view on others

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:43.780 
like I needed to push my view on others
i<00:02:42.680> want<00:02:42.860> to<00:02:42.950> know<00:02:43.040> there's<00:02:43.250> people<00:02:43.460> to

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
i want to know there's people to

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.300 
i want to know there's people to
understand<00:02:44.300> where<00:02:44.870> I<00:02:44.900> came<00:02:45.080> from<00:02:45.320> but<00:02:46.070> as<00:02:46.190> you

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
understand where I came from but as you

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.830 
understand where I came from but as you
kind<00:02:46.520> of<00:02:46.610> grow<00:02:46.700> up<00:02:46.910> you<00:02:47.060> realize<00:02:47.390> that<00:02:47.630> other

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
kind of grow up you realize that other

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.540 
kind of grow up you realize that other
people<00:02:48.020> believe<00:02:48.560> what<00:02:48.710> they<00:02:48.770> believe<00:02:48.890> and<00:02:49.460> you

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
people believe what they believe and you

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.910 
people believe what they believe and you
can't<00:02:49.880> really<00:02:50.060> change<00:02:50.390> it<00:02:50.690> and<00:02:50.900> so<00:02:51.470> you<00:02:51.770> just

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
can't really change it and so you just

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.350 
can't really change it and so you just
kind<00:02:52.070> of<00:02:52.160> have<00:02:52.220> to<00:02:52.340> understand<00:02:52.880> why<00:02:53.180> they

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
kind of have to understand why they

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.790 
kind of have to understand why they
believe<00:02:53.540> what<00:02:53.810> they<00:02:53.840> believe<00:02:53.990> and<00:02:54.440> I<00:02:54.560> think

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
believe what they believe and I think

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.200 
believe what they believe and I think
that<00:02:54.950> that's<00:02:54.980> really<00:02:55.340> the<00:02:55.550> most<00:02:55.670> important

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210 
that that's really the most important

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.990 
that that's really the most important
thing<00:02:56.480> that<00:02:57.140> I've<00:02:57.350> learned<00:02:57.380> growing<00:02:58.040> up<00:02:58.400> and<00:02:58.700> a

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
thing that I've learned growing up and a

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.240 
thing that I've learned growing up and a
lot<00:02:59.300> of<00:02:59.330> times<00:02:59.630> I<00:02:59.840> just<00:03:00.110> will<00:03:00.620> choose<00:03:00.890> not<00:03:01.070> to

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
lot of times I just will choose not to

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.590 
lot of times I just will choose not to
talk<00:03:01.460> about<00:03:01.490> it<00:03:01.910> if<00:03:02.090> I'm<00:03:02.210> in<00:03:02.330> a<00:03:02.360> situation

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
talk about it if I'm in a situation

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.440 
talk about it if I'm in a situation
where<00:03:03.260> I<00:03:03.290> just<00:03:03.590> don't<00:03:03.800> think<00:03:04.040> that<00:03:04.130> it's<00:03:04.790> going

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
where I just don't think that it's going

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.630 
where I just don't think that it's going
to<00:03:05.630> be<00:03:05.720> very<00:03:05.750> pleasant<00:03:06.470> and<00:03:06.650> you<00:03:07.130> know<00:03:07.250> what<00:03:07.400> if

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
to be very pleasant and you know what if

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.890 
to be very pleasant and you know what if
I<00:03:07.790> feel<00:03:08.000> like<00:03:08.120> I<00:03:08.300> can<00:03:08.450> have<00:03:08.600> a<00:03:08.630> great

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
I feel like I can have a great

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.690 
I feel like I can have a great
conversation<00:03:09.140> with<00:03:09.650> somebody<00:03:09.980> about<00:03:10.280> it<00:03:10.430> then

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
conversation with somebody about it then

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.400 
conversation with somebody about it then
I'm<00:03:10.820> more<00:03:10.940> than<00:03:11.090> willing<00:03:11.150> to<00:03:11.510> talk<00:03:12.080> about<00:03:12.110> it

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
I'm more than willing to talk about it

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.530 
I'm more than willing to talk about it
as<00:03:12.950> I've<00:03:13.250> grown<00:03:13.400> up<00:03:13.610> I've<00:03:13.790> kind<00:03:14.030> of<00:03:14.120> not<00:03:14.330> let

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
as I've grown up I've kind of not let

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.260 
as I've grown up I've kind of not let
atheism<00:03:15.170> to<00:03:15.290> find<00:03:15.530> me<00:03:15.709> just<00:03:16.400> a<00:03:16.489> part<00:03:16.730> of<00:03:16.820> me<00:03:17.060> I

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
atheism to find me just a part of me I

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:18.760 
atheism to find me just a part of me I
think<00:03:17.720> it's<00:03:17.840> important<00:03:18.230> to<00:03:18.290> keep<00:03:18.320> in<00:03:18.530> mind

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
think it's important to keep in mind

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:19.690 
think it's important to keep in mind
that<00:03:18.830> you<00:03:18.980> don't<00:03:19.010> want<00:03:19.250> anything<00:03:19.489> to

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
that you don't want anything to

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.670 
that you don't want anything to
overpower<00:03:20.239> you<00:03:20.540> as<00:03:20.690> a<00:03:20.720> person<00:03:21.200> that's<00:03:21.440> my

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
overpower you as a person that's my

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.770 
overpower you as a person that's my
story<00:03:21.980> I<00:03:22.160> know<00:03:22.520> that<00:03:22.850> I<00:03:22.880> kind<00:03:23.150> of<00:03:23.270> have<00:03:23.480> a<00:03:23.510> very

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
story I know that I kind of have a very

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.930 
story I know that I kind of have a very
fortunate<00:03:24.440> one<00:03:24.620> I<00:03:24.950> have<00:03:25.220> a<00:03:25.250> lot<00:03:25.489> of<00:03:25.520> friends

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
fortunate one I have a lot of friends

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.670 
fortunate one I have a lot of friends
and<00:03:26.060> family<00:03:26.120> that<00:03:26.540> are<00:03:26.600> very<00:03:26.810> supportive<00:03:27.110> and

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
and family that are very supportive and

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.380 
and family that are very supportive and
so<00:03:28.190> I<00:03:28.220> haven't<00:03:28.459> really<00:03:28.670> had<00:03:28.910> to<00:03:29.060> deal<00:03:29.239> with<00:03:29.270> a

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
so I haven't really had to deal with a

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.380 
so I haven't really had to deal with a
lot<00:03:29.480> of<00:03:29.630> backlash<00:03:29.900> being<00:03:30.500> an<00:03:30.620> atheist<00:03:31.060> but<00:03:32.060> I

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
lot of backlash being an atheist but I

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.860 
lot of backlash being an atheist but I
think<00:03:32.720> that<00:03:33.050> if<00:03:33.350> you<00:03:34.220> can't<00:03:34.489> find<00:03:34.880> support<00:03:35.630> and

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
think that if you can't find support and

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.810 
think that if you can't find support and
your<00:03:36.020> friends<00:03:36.440> or<00:03:36.620> your<00:03:36.650> family<00:03:36.830> i<00:03:37.280> think<00:03:37.640> that

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
your friends or your family i think that

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.729 
your friends or your family i think that
youtube<00:03:38.180> is<00:03:38.330> a<00:03:38.390> good<00:03:38.600> place<00:03:38.840> to<00:03:39.050> turn<00:03:39.260> it's<00:03:39.590> a

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
youtube is a good place to turn it's a

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.380 
youtube is a good place to turn it's a
way<00:03:39.860> to<00:03:39.890> talk<00:03:40.190> to<00:03:40.250> other<00:03:40.520> people<00:03:40.970> who<00:03:41.180> feel

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
way to talk to other people who feel

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.930 
way to talk to other people who feel
like<00:03:41.570> what<00:03:42.020> how<00:03:42.350> you<00:03:42.410> feel<00:03:42.890> and<00:03:43.220> I<00:03:43.640> think<00:03:43.700> that

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
like what how you feel and I think that

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.640 
like what how you feel and I think that
as<00:03:44.270> you<00:03:44.450> grow<00:03:44.570> up<00:03:44.660> you'll<00:03:44.959> learn<00:03:45.170> that<00:03:45.230> you'll

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
as you grow up you'll learn that you'll

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.070 
as you grow up you'll learn that you'll
be<00:03:45.770> able<00:03:45.890> to<00:03:46.040> find<00:03:46.340> other<00:03:46.640> people<00:03:47.150> that<00:03:47.420> have

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
be able to find other people that have

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.979 
be able to find other people that have
the<00:03:48.230> same<00:03:48.470> opinions<00:03:49.280> as<00:03:49.550> you<00:03:49.850> and<00:03:50.330> if<00:03:50.750> they

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
the same opinions as you and if they

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:52.840 
the same opinions as you and if they
don't<00:03:51.200> then<00:03:51.530> I<00:03:51.590> think<00:03:51.950> that<00:03:52.130> that<00:03:52.160> creates<00:03:52.670> a

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
don't then I think that that creates a

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.220 
don't then I think that that creates a
great<00:03:53.030> opportunity<00:03:53.360> you<00:03:53.780> learn<00:03:54.050> about

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
great opportunity you learn about

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.050 
great opportunity you learn about
different<00:03:54.560> points<00:03:55.010> of<00:03:55.100> view<00:03:55.370> so<00:03:55.850> I<00:03:55.880> hope<00:03:56.000> that

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
different points of view so I hope that

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.720 
different points of view so I hope that
helped<00:03:56.510> it<00:03:57.050> probably<00:03:57.440> didn't<00:03:57.739> hopefully<00:03:58.700> i

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
helped it probably didn't hopefully i

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.100 
helped it probably didn't hopefully i
will<00:03:58.850> start<00:03:59.239> making<00:03:59.690> more<00:04:00.080> videos<00:04:00.380> soon
