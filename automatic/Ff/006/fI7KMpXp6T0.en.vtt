00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.169 

let's<00:00:00.450> take<00:00:00.690> a<00:00:00.719> look<00:00:00.989> at<00:00:01.230> how<00:00:01.490> LiveView<00:00:02.490> works

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
let's take a look at how LiveView works

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.039 
let's take a look at how LiveView works
on<00:00:03.419> the<00:00:03.510> Nikon<00:00:03.899> d3x<00:00:05.629> operation<00:00:06.629> is<00:00:06.750> very

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
on the Nikon d3x operation is very

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.620 
on the Nikon d3x operation is very
similar<00:00:07.319> under<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.770> other<00:00:07.890> Nikon<00:00:08.280> SLRs<00:00:08.910> and

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
similar under the other Nikon SLRs and

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.530 
similar under the other Nikon SLRs and
all<00:00:09.960> of<00:00:10.230> them<00:00:10.440> suffer<00:00:11.130> from<00:00:11.309> some<00:00:12.090> severe

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
all of them suffer from some severe

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.890 
all of them suffer from some severe
usability<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.559> design<00:00:13.950> flaws<00:00:14.450> you<00:00:15.450> can<00:00:15.690> use

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
usability and design flaws you can use

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.689 
usability and design flaws you can use
live<00:00:16.109> view<00:00:16.139> very<00:00:16.590> successfully<00:00:17.220> on<00:00:17.369> these

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
live view very successfully on these

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.359 
live view very successfully on these
cameras<00:00:18.180> but<00:00:19.170> it's<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.650> lot<00:00:19.830> harder<00:00:19.859> than<00:00:20.189> it

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
cameras but it's a lot harder than it

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.029 
cameras but it's a lot harder than it
needs<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.670> be<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.210> here<00:00:21.449> we'll<00:00:21.570> see<00:00:21.750> why<00:00:22.039> I've

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
needs to be and here we'll see why I've

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.689 
needs to be and here we'll see why I've
got<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.430> d3x<00:00:24.029> in<00:00:24.330> Live<00:00:24.510> View<00:00:24.539> mode<00:00:24.779> here<00:00:25.699> to

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
got the d3x in Live View mode here to

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:27.950 
got the d3x in Live View mode here to
get<00:00:26.849> there<00:00:27.029> I<00:00:27.060> had<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.330> rotate<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.750> mode<00:00:27.930> dial

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
get there I had to rotate the mode dial

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.700 
get there I had to rotate the mode dial
up<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.590> live<00:00:28.769> you<00:00:29.039> up<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.369> up<00:00:29.519> at<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.789> top<00:00:30.000> here

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
up to live you up it up at the top here

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.990 
up to live you up it up at the top here
let's<00:00:31.710> zoom<00:00:32.550> in<00:00:33.410> to<00:00:34.410> this<00:00:34.530> flower<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.280> notice

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
let's zoom in to this flower and notice

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000 
let's zoom in to this flower and notice
a<00:00:36.149> couple<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.480> things<00:00:36.719> one<00:00:37.200> is<00:00:37.260> it's<00:00:37.500> blurry<00:00:37.770> so

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
a couple of things one is it's blurry so

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.369 
a couple of things one is it's blurry so
we're<00:00:38.100> gonna<00:00:38.190> need<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.370> focus<00:00:38.809> notice<00:00:39.809> also

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
we're gonna need to focus notice also

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.840 
we're gonna need to focus notice also
that<00:00:40.559> it's<00:00:40.800> too<00:00:40.950> bright<00:00:41.190> it's<00:00:41.399> blown<00:00:41.640> out

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
that it's too bright it's blown out

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.900 
that it's too bright it's blown out
that's<00:00:42.360> not<00:00:42.570> just<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.930> video<00:00:43.140> camera<00:00:43.500> here

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
that's not just the video camera here

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.029 
that's not just the video camera here
I'm<00:00:44.910> an<00:00:45.180> aperture<00:00:45.539> priority<00:00:45.870> mode<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.649> the

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
I'm an aperture priority mode and the

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.770 
I'm an aperture priority mode and the
only<00:00:47.190> way<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:47.489> can<00:00:47.730> seem<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:47.969> get<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.239> camera<00:00:48.600> to

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
only way I can seem to get the camera to

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.430 
only way I can seem to get the camera to
deal<00:00:49.410> with<00:00:49.559> this<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.010> stop<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.430> lens<00:00:50.610> down

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
deal with this is to stop the lens down

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.029 
deal with this is to stop the lens down
and<00:00:52.879> unfortunately<00:00:54.320> when<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.350> stop<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.860> lens

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
and unfortunately when I stop the lens

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.619 
and unfortunately when I stop the lens
down<00:00:56.340> notice<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.059> depth<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.390> field

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
down notice that the depth of field

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.840 
down notice that the depth of field
increases<00:00:58.219> which<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.399> completely

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
increases which is completely

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.299 
increases which is completely
counterproductive<00:01:00.300> because<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.530> can't<00:01:02.100> focus

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
counterproductive because I can't focus

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.750 
counterproductive because I can't focus
accurately<00:01:03.030> with<00:01:03.420> depth<00:01:03.660> of<00:01:03.809> field<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.229> deep

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
accurately with depth of field that deep

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.710 
accurately with depth of field that deep
therefore<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.790> have<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.060> open<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.420> lens<00:01:06.570> all

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
therefore I have to open the lens all

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.560 
therefore I have to open the lens all
the<00:01:06.810> way<00:01:06.930> up<00:01:07.189> which<00:01:08.189> will<00:01:08.400> be<00:01:08.520> f3<00:01:09.030> in<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.299> case

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
the way up which will be f3 in this case

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.289 
the way up which will be f3 in this case
and<00:01:10.280> I'm<00:01:11.280> gonna<00:01:11.430> have<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.700> do<00:01:11.820> something<00:01:12.150> else

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
and I'm gonna have to do something else

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.060 
and I'm gonna have to do something else
which<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.750> move<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.080> manual<00:01:13.500> mode<00:01:13.530> so<00:01:13.979> I'm

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
which is to move to manual mode so I'm

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.810 
which is to move to manual mode so I'm
changing<00:01:14.520> that<00:01:15.200> and<00:01:16.200> now<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.009> can<00:01:17.400> control<00:01:17.640> the

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
changing that and now I can control the

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.969 
changing that and now I can control the
shutter<00:01:18.030> speed<00:01:18.210> instead<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.020> get<00:01:19.290> it<00:01:19.439> about

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
shutter speed instead and get it about

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.950 
shutter speed instead and get it about
the<00:01:20.250> right<00:01:20.400> brightness<00:01:20.850> I'm<00:01:21.450> going<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.780> use

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
the right brightness I'm going to use

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.980 
the right brightness I'm going to use
the<00:01:22.140> AF<00:01:22.560> on<00:01:22.830> button<00:01:23.430> here<00:01:23.790> on<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:24.119> autofocus

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
the AF on button here on a autofocus

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.770 
the AF on button here on a autofocus
lens<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.380> can<00:01:25.500> press<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:26.360> it<00:01:27.360> does<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.540> pretty

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
lens you can press that it does a pretty

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.750 
lens you can press that it does a pretty
darn<00:01:28.020> good<00:01:28.080> job<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.619> giving<00:01:28.710> Sherriff<00:01:29.159> focus

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
darn good job of giving Sherriff focus

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.570 
darn good job of giving Sherriff focus
and<00:01:31.510> once<00:01:31.930> I've<00:01:32.110> done<00:01:32.260> that<00:01:32.320> I<00:01:32.740> think<00:01:33.220> I'm

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
and once I've done that I think I'm

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.100 
and once I've done that I think I'm
ready<00:01:33.790> to<00:01:33.880> go<00:01:34.150> except<00:01:34.630> that<00:01:34.840> there's<00:01:35.050> a

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
ready to go except that there's a

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.610 
ready to go except that there's a
problem

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 
problem

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.820 
problem
I<00:01:36.390> changed<00:01:37.390> the<00:01:37.570> exposure<00:01:38.050> in<00:01:38.320> order<00:01:38.560> to<00:01:38.680> get

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
I changed the exposure in order to get

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.130 
I changed the exposure in order to get
this<00:01:39.010> live<00:01:39.310> view<00:01:39.580> looking<00:01:39.940> right<00:01:40.210> so<00:01:40.900> now<00:01:41.110> I

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
this live view looking right so now I

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.840 
this live view looking right so now I
have<00:01:41.440> to<00:01:41.620> go<00:01:41.710> back<00:01:41.920> and<00:01:42.280> of<00:01:42.370> course<00:01:42.550> it<00:01:42.700> doesn't

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
have to go back and of course it doesn't

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.330 
have to go back and of course it doesn't
show<00:01:43.150> me<00:01:43.300> what<00:01:43.450> my<00:01:43.570> exposure<00:01:43.930> is<00:01:44.230> here<00:01:44.500> there's

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
show me what my exposure is here there's

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.340 
show me what my exposure is here there's
various<00:01:45.730> info<00:01:46.090> buttons<00:01:48.330> but<00:01:49.330> I<00:01:49.600> can<00:01:50.230> never

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
various info buttons but I can never

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.230 
various info buttons but I can never
remember<00:01:50.530> which<00:01:50.740> is<00:01:50.860> which<00:01:51.010> anyway<00:01:51.910> so<00:01:51.970> I'm

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
remember which is which anyway so I'm

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.880 
remember which is which anyway so I'm
going<00:01:52.390> to<00:01:52.420> look<00:01:52.540> at<00:01:52.660> the<00:01:52.750> camera<00:01:53.170> I'm<00:01:53.590> going<00:01:53.800> to

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
going to look at the camera I'm going to
