00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
came up with back in Halo Reach so it's

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.640 
came up with back in Halo Reach so it's
a<00:00:16.920> huge<00:00:17.250> interior<00:00:17.760> map<00:00:18.210> you<00:00:19.109> kind<00:00:19.350> of<00:00:19.410> roam

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
a huge interior map you kind of roam

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.439 
a huge interior map you kind of roam
around<00:00:19.770> in<00:00:20.160> you<00:00:20.369> can<00:00:20.520> use<00:00:20.640> your<00:00:20.760> thruster<00:00:21.240> pack

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
around in you can use your thruster pack

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.390 
around in you can use your thruster pack
to<00:00:21.660> go<00:00:21.779> off<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.170> sides<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.830> you<00:00:23.039> get<00:00:23.160> really

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
to go off the sides and you get really

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.519 
to go off the sides and you get really
great<00:00:23.699> speed<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.330> it's<00:00:24.480> for<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.750> whole<00:00:25.019> host<00:00:25.289> of

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
great speed and it's for a whole host of

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.349 
great speed and it's for a whole host of
different<00:00:25.859> mini<00:00:26.010> games<00:00:26.250> that<00:00:26.910> are<00:00:27.029> played<00:00:27.150> on

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
different mini games that are played on

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.790 
different mini games that are played on
the<00:00:27.449> inside<00:00:27.779> so<00:00:28.019> what<00:00:28.349> you'll<00:00:28.470> be<00:00:28.590> seeing

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
the inside so what you'll be seeing

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.070 
the inside so what you'll be seeing
today<00:00:28.980> is<00:00:29.220> some<00:00:29.460> footage<00:00:29.609> of<00:00:29.939> hot<00:00:30.630> Rotato

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
today is some footage of hot Rotato

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.160 
today is some footage of hot Rotato
gyrus<00:00:32.070> side<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:33.059> it<00:00:33.180> also<00:00:33.300> supports<00:00:33.750> orbit

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
gyrus side and it also supports orbit

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.010 
gyrus side and it also supports orbit
PSS<00:00:34.620> this<00:00:34.829> is<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.070> regicide<00:00:35.719> version<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.899> it

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
PSS this is the regicide version of it

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.650 
PSS this is the regicide version of it
basically<00:00:37.469> what<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.430> everyone<00:00:39.420> has

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
basically what it is is everyone has

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.479 
basically what it is is everyone has
random<00:00:39.960> weapons<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:41.010> go<00:00:41.100> around<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.370> map

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
random weapons and you go around the map

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.500 
random weapons and you go around the map
and<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.700> try<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:41.969> kill<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.180> different

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
and you try and kill the different

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.869 
and you try and kill the different
players<00:00:42.690> who<00:00:42.960> have<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.950> know<00:00:44.070> high<00:00:44.219> speed<00:00:44.610> and

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
players who have you know high speed and

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.190 
players who have you know high speed and
with<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.149> thrusters<00:00:45.600> right<00:00:45.840> here<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.079> can

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
with the thrusters right here you can

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.049 
with the thrusters right here you can
actually<00:00:46.469> go<00:00:46.559> all<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.950> way<00:00:46.980> around<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:48.000> you

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
actually go all the way around it so you

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.510 
actually go all the way around it so you
can<00:00:48.210> orbit<00:00:48.450> around<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.870> entire<00:00:49.260> inside<00:00:50.250> of

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
can orbit around the entire inside of

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.209 
can orbit around the entire inside of
this<00:00:50.760> sphere<00:00:51.199> now<00:00:52.199> through<00:00:52.500> itself<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:53.010> really

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
this sphere now through itself is really

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.490 
this sphere now through itself is really
cool<00:00:53.520> really<00:00:53.760> well<00:00:53.969> done<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.449> forging<00:00:55.410> is

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
cool really well done the forging is

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.080 
cool really well done the forging is
smooth<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:56.129> don't<00:00:56.250> think<00:00:56.399> I've<00:00:56.460> ever<00:00:56.520> hit<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.820> lip

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
smooth I don't think I've ever hit a lip

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.430 
smooth I don't think I've ever hit a lip
in<00:00:57.239> here<00:00:57.390> which<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.629> incredible<00:00:58.140> with<00:00:58.289> that

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
in here which is incredible with that

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.349 
in here which is incredible with that
precision<00:00:58.770> editing<00:00:59.219> or<00:00:59.730> some<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.239> other

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
precision editing or some of the other

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.910 
precision editing or some of the other
tools<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:00.719> we've<00:01:00.899> seen<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.410> mean<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.859> just

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
looks awesome to be inside of this huge

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.570 
looks awesome to be inside of this huge
sphere<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.619> don't<00:01:04.769> really<00:01:04.860> get<00:01:05.010> any<00:01:05.159> screen

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
sphere you don't really get any screen

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.859 
sphere you don't really get any screen
lag<00:01:05.729> even<00:01:05.939> with<00:01:06.210> all<00:01:06.420> these<00:01:06.630> different

lag even with all these different

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.109 
lag even with all these different
players<00:01:07.320> on<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.680> inside<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.790> know<00:01:08.880> shooting

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
players on the inside you know shooting

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.580 
players on the inside you know shooting
around<00:01:09.240> all<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.810> weapons<00:01:10.140> going<00:01:10.350> off<00:01:10.439> all

around all the weapons going off all

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.080 
around all the weapons going off all
that<00:01:10.710> stuff<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.040> handles<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.430> really<00:01:11.729> solidly

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090

type of Lobby any number of people and

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.899 
type of Lobby any number of people and
of<00:01:20.040> course<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.310> know<00:01:20.400> it's<00:01:20.520> always<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.790> luck

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
of course you know it's always the luck

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.340 
of course you know it's always the luck
of<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.060> draw<00:01:21.240> what<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.630> found<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:21.990> actually<00:01:22.110> the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
of the draw what I found is actually the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.719 
of the draw what I found is actually the
precision<00:01:22.799> weapons<00:01:23.130> like<00:01:23.310> these<00:01:23.490> are

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
precision weapons like these are

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.880 
precision weapons like these are
actually<00:01:24.030> way<00:01:24.180> better<00:01:24.470> because<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.710> low

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
actually way better because of the low

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.590 
actually way better because of the low
health<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.340> players<00:01:26.580> have<00:01:26.850> it's<00:01:27.299> much

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
health that players have it's much

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.539 
health that players have it's much
better<00:01:27.780> than<00:01:28.140> actually<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.710> fuel<00:01:29.040> rod<00:01:29.220> gun<00:01:29.369> or

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549

to<00:02:50.520> nail<00:02:50.700> some<00:02:50.910> people<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:51.480> that's<00:02:51.720> only

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
to nail some people and that's only

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.390 
to nail some people and that's only
possible<00:02:52.080> here<00:02:52.470> because<00:02:52.709> you<00:02:52.830> can<00:02:53.070> kind<00:02:53.370> of

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
possible here because you can kind of

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.120 
possible here because you can kind of
camp<00:02:53.700> out<00:02:53.880> where<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.570> oddball<00:02:54.989> is<00:02:55.200> otherwise

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
camp out where the oddball is otherwise

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.530 
camp out where the oddball is otherwise
when<00:02:56.400> you<00:02:56.489> do<00:02:56.670> have<00:02:56.910> it<00:02:57.000> I'd<00:02:57.060> recommend<00:02:57.480> you

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
when you do have it I'd recommend you

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.790 
when you do have it I'd recommend you
know<00:02:57.660> just<00:02:57.870> shooting<00:02:58.080> around<00:02:58.140> as<00:02:58.410> fast<00:02:58.560> as

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
know just shooting around as fast as

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.290 
know just shooting around as fast as
possible<00:02:59.220> that<00:02:59.730> way<00:02:59.820> no<00:02:59.940> one<00:02:59.970> can<00:03:00.180> really

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
possible that way no one can really

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.360 
possible that way no one can really
track<00:03:00.600> you<00:03:00.750> down<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:01.500> basically<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.220> main

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
track you down and basically the main

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.650 
track you down and basically the main
thing<00:03:02.520> that's<00:03:02.610> gonna<00:03:02.790> happen<00:03:02.940> then<00:03:03.209> is<00:03:03.360> you

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660
