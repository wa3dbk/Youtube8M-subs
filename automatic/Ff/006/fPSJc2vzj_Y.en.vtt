00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
the idea of having a control called DNA

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.740 
the idea of having a control called DNA
and<00:02:01.009> what<00:02:01.280> it<00:02:01.430> does<00:02:01.610> is<00:02:01.880> control<00:02:02.180> the<00:02:02.330> cars

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
and what it does is control the cars

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.070 
and what it does is control the cars
