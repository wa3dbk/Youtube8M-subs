00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:24.890
 Hello guys 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:27.800
 Here it is our shooting but I have 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.419
 Now this generator I did not 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:36.129
 it is worth collecting only this key 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:40.129
 1815 and here comes the signal from the generator 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:44.300
 here goes parallel wires go with 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:49.580
 generator generator goes to the transistor 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:52.369
 Voltage 24 volt gate-unlocking 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:59.960
 less than go to the scheme on the scheme we 

00:00:52.369 --> 00:01:02.530
 coming now 2 and 6 here 2 and 6 volts 2 and 6 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.710
 volt this voltage is less 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.130
 actuation 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.770
 This new stabilizer is so 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.670
 conditionally that is this 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:21.590
 the coil here it is she I'll open it now 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:32.900
 show first here it is done this 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:39.580
 I will close the reel in an original way 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:39.580
 back even found an old ferrite that's about 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:47.240
 what I want to show now is this not 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:51.140
 is working with us that is this here is yellow 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:54.979
 probe he oscillograph he just goes on 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.290
 midi this scheme is now at the same time 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:00.790
 voltage she did not turn on naturally 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.790
 our LEDs are off 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:12.620
 but we have tension 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:14.720
 here comes 19 hertz 19 hertz coming i'm not 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.950
 talking about what signals of their time and 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.760
 about his time 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:22.239
 about everything else I have no right to go with us 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:28.430
 on this spoon 1910 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:33.320
 food goes 2 and 6 volts and what are we 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:37.130
 see in our coil in our coil 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:40.010
 see here is a signal that showed vadik 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.140
 but I have it a little stronger than 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.800
 I'm not the first time already collecting this 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.800
 similar design 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:54.550
 so I have more serious fronts 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:58.220
 that is, we give 2 and 6 volts and 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:04.040
 we see that the purest and we serve 2 and 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:07.910
 6 volts and the frequency is 19 hertz but this one 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:10.459
 transistor and how we see the continuous 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:16.040
 our coil oscillations 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:21.350
 in conjunction with pyrite he she buzzes 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:27.340
 and on the purity of 293 will be a little 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:29.320
 290 kHz is wrong here is not our 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:35.030
 damped oscillations 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:38.950
 that is, here it is the beam it is now standing here 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:42.350
 here on the sewer then on the sewer 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:45.100
 This transistor is here we 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:51.019
 see our 19 hertz 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:54.880
 All this set of works efirita 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:04:00.440
 coil designs in automatic 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:03.560
 undamped oscillations ah well i'm thinking 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.350
 Now I will show the operation of the voltage 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.690
 eat now i will increase 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.710
 supply voltage up to the moment 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.630
 actuation 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:19.430
 of our voltage regulator before 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:23.830
 how do the diodes light up then 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.830
 there is now you can add a little bit 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:36.640
 so 2 of 6 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:43.060
 here are 2 and 6 and our LEDs are on 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:46.510
 they caught fire and our two 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:51.470
 undamped vibrations become even more 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:54.110
 10 volts here at the collector 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:58.700
 undamped oscillations with the frequency of the firm 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:02.960
 resonance and overall design turned out 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:06.020
 and 10 volts that is, in principle, itself 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:09.350
 you can even write here 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.120
 without this generator, well, it is necessary 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.520
 to stabilize since we have a load 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:17.690
 there is 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:23.030
 Nights can tell you a vadik but big 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:25.940
 Good luck successes I'm glad that literally already 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:29.440
 for probably a year and a half I see a man 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:33.640
 who came to do with his own mind 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:37.820
 launched the circuit was able to stabilize 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:41.870
 given process and get with like this 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:45.520
 called free energy further 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:48.710
 I will not even collect the scheme for everyone 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:51.590
 unbelievers and bitches can 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:54.400
 consult with the author he you 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:57.880
 will say that this is true work 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.880
 this device 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:06.730
 I have nothing more to tell 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:09.430
 rights do not be offended all questions to the author 

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:10.120
 this scheme but very original 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.419
 decision 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:16.210
 generally very straightforward but original 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:18.550
 with this original solution a little bit 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:20.620
 it is necessary to change the design vadik 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:23.980
 I can say for sure because I am no longer 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:26.919
 The first time I collect this design on 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:30.220
 such power yes there are two but three 

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:32.220
 the led what was your mistake this 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:35.230
 pure you will understand only you 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:36.520
 the mistake was you had two 

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:39.100
 LED's but I do not really 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:41.500
 considered I may not have seen no 

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.060
 I do not know but could not raise 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.070
 power because you have two 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:47.260
 the LEDs were parallel necessary 

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:49.630
 consistently and here on the way out 

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:52.240
 raise a little tension then 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:55.810
 Naturally you have a return line 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:59.470
 run and that's all, and but also what can 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:01.750
 say here it is the aggregate chip 

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:05.140
 There is a lot of work with this transistor 

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:09.280
 eats just eats the power of one of 

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:12.040
 LED's that is required of her 

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:14.740
 can be replaced with a simple multivibrator 

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:17.380
 it will be much more economical for 

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:23.160
 the formation of what is needed here 

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:27.120
 this is what this generator is 

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:27.120
 see the free energy 

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:34.360
 he will be so happy to drive with you 

00:07:32.199 --> 00:07:37.270
 it is even possible to talk together 

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:40.930
 to work, that is, you see not for that 

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:42.520
 to learn something new I can even 

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:45.340
 I will be very happy to share something 

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:54.460
 talk to you and in general 

00:07:45.340 --> 00:08:01.860
 discuss something interesting for the future we 

00:07:54.460 --> 00:08:01.860
 all well, good luck to all
