00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.010 
they weren't like the 35mm cameras where
you<00:00:38.250> just<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.239> shutter<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.840> it

automatically went to the next frame you

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.670 
automatically went to the next frame you
had<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.760> roll<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.149> on<00:00:42.300> look<00:00:42.960> for<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.260> numbers

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
had to roll it on look for the numbers

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.979 
had to roll it on look for the numbers
and<00:00:43.950> then<00:00:44.100> stop<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.570> film<00:00:45.809> would<00:00:45.930> be

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
and then stop so that the film would be

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.830 
and then stop so that the film would be
registered<00:00:46.649> over<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.370> film<00:00:47.789> plane<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.300> then

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
registered over the film plane and then

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.869 
registered over the film plane and then
this<00:00:48.930> is<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.140> shutter<00:00:49.469> release<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:50.460> still

and print in the darkroom and I found

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.899 
and print in the darkroom and I found
over<00:01:28.650> the

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
over the

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:30.789 
over the
30<00:01:29.539> years<00:01:29.780> that<00:01:29.899> I've<00:01:30.049> been<00:01:30.079> teaching<00:01:30.380> there

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
30 years that I've been teaching there

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.679 
30 years that I've been teaching there
that<00:01:31.100> makes<00:01:31.399> them<00:01:31.670> to<00:01:31.880> be<00:01:32.090> better

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
that makes them to be better

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:35.529 
that makes them to be better
photographers<00:01:33.560> because<00:01:34.069> they<00:01:34.850> have<00:01:35.179> to<00:01:35.390> learn

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
photographers because they have to learn

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:38.139 
photographers because they have to learn
how<00:01:35.600> to<00:01:35.899> do<00:01:36.109> it<00:01:36.229> in<00:01:36.350> the<00:01:36.469> camera<00:01:36.969> instead<00:01:37.969> of

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
how to do it in the camera instead of

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:41.319 
how to do it in the camera instead of
the<00:01:38.359> concept<00:01:39.020> of<00:01:39.200> I'll<00:01:39.710> fix<00:01:40.399> it<00:01:40.520> in<00:01:40.700> photoshop

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
the concept of I'll fix it in photoshop

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:44.349 
the concept of I'll fix it in photoshop
so<00:01:42.259> we're<00:01:42.500> sticking<00:01:42.890> with<00:01:42.920> film<00:01:43.310> and<00:01:43.490> I<00:01:44.030> think

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:44.359 
so we're sticking with film and I think

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:48.039 
so we're sticking with film and I think
photographers<00:01:45.200> that<00:01:45.229> were<00:01:45.530> trained<00:01:45.920> on<00:01:47.049> film

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
photographers that were trained on film

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.359 
photographers that were trained on film
like<00:01:48.319> me<00:01:49.479> have<00:01:50.479> an<00:01:50.599> advantage<00:01:50.929> over<00:01:51.259> the<00:01:51.859> the

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
like me have an advantage over the the

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.639 
like me have an advantage over the the
new<00:01:52.520> photographers<00:01:53.209> that<00:01:53.599> are<00:01:53.990> shooting<00:01:54.319> or

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
new photographers that are shooting or

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:57.569

just started out with digital so i'll be

00:01:57.579 --> 00:01:59.919 
just started out with digital so i'll be
