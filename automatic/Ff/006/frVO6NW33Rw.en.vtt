00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:11.990 
hi I'm David and this is the combination

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.350 
hi I'm David and this is the combination
we're<00:00:12.260> working<00:00:12.559> on<00:00:12.650> today<00:00:12.860> I<00:00:13.549> want<00:00:13.940> you<00:00:14.090> to<00:00:14.209> pay

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:16.189 
attention to that there are variables

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:18.220 
attention to that there are variables
that<00:00:16.400> it<00:00:16.580> can<00:00:16.700> add<00:00:16.970> or<00:00:17.300> subtract<00:00:17.779> to<00:00:18.080> this

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:18.230 
that it can add or subtract to this

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.929 
that it can add or subtract to this
combination<00:00:18.770> and<00:00:18.980> you<00:00:19.550> want<00:00:19.730> to<00:00:19.790> make<00:00:19.910> sure

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
combination and you want to make sure

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:21.880 
combination and you want to make sure
that<00:00:20.210> you're<00:00:20.240> in<00:00:20.419> proper<00:00:20.720> posture<00:00:20.930> otherwise

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
that you're in proper posture otherwise

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.769 
that you're in proper posture otherwise
the<00:00:22.130> visual<00:00:22.460> effect<00:00:22.730> of<00:00:22.880> this<00:00:23.000> combination

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
the visual effect of this combination

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:25.150 
the visual effect of this combination
doesn't<00:00:24.050> really<00:00:24.349> translate<00:00:24.650> the<00:00:25.010> way<00:00:25.100> you

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
doesn't really translate the way you

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.640 
doesn't really translate the way you
would<00:00:25.369> like<00:00:25.519> it<00:00:25.670> to<00:00:25.789> be<00:00:25.820> okay<00:00:26.660> so<00:00:26.720> let's<00:00:26.990> get<00:00:27.590> on

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
would like it to be okay so let's get on

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.519 
would like it to be okay so let's get on
with<00:00:27.740> it<00:00:27.949> we<00:00:28.939> start<00:00:29.269> with<00:00:29.330> for<00:00:29.930> weight<00:00:30.109> changes

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
with it we start with for weight changes

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:36.369 
with it we start with for weight changes
going<00:00:30.980> one<00:00:31.750> two<00:00:32.750> three<00:00:33.110> four<00:00:34.900> arms<00:00:35.900> will<00:00:36.230> go

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:36.379 
going one two three four arms will go

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:39.400 
going one two three four arms will go
from<00:00:37.070> the<00:00:37.610> diaphragm<00:00:38.019> down<00:00:39.019> to<00:00:39.199> first

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
from the diaphragm down to first

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.209 
from the diaphragm down to first
position<00:00:39.920> through<00:00:40.700> fifth<00:00:41.239> position<00:00:42.219> seventh

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
position through fifth position seventh

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:47.470 
position through fifth position seventh
position<00:00:43.460> and<00:00:44.379> bending<00:00:45.379> at<00:00:45.469> six<00:00:46.360> what<00:00:47.360> we're

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
position and bending at six what we're

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.670 
position and bending at six what we're
going<00:00:47.629> to<00:00:47.780> do<00:00:47.930> with<00:00:48.079> this<00:00:48.200> we're<00:00:48.469> going<00:00:48.590> to

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
going to do with this we're going to

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.950 
going to do with this we're going to
develop<00:00:49.129> it<00:00:49.219> the<00:00:49.489> following<00:00:49.640> way<00:00:50.000> we're<00:00:50.809> going

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
develop it the following way we're going

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.319 
develop it the following way we're going
to<00:00:51.050> have<00:00:51.200> a<00:00:51.410> shimmy<00:00:51.710> all<00:00:52.399> the<00:00:52.850> weight<00:00:53.000> changes

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
to have a shimmy all the weight changes

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:59.139 
to have a shimmy all the weight changes
so<00:00:54.050> my<00:00:54.170> arms<00:00:54.440> will<00:00:54.559> go<00:00:54.710> one<00:00:55.480> two<00:00:56.530> three<00:00:57.530> four<00:00:58.430> on

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
so my arms will go one two three four on

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:01.119 
so my arms will go one two three four on
this<00:00:59.539> Jimmy<00:00:59.780> I'm<00:00:59.989> going<00:01:00.230> to<00:01:00.320> add<00:01:00.440> a<00:01:00.469> camel

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
this Jimmy I'm going to add a camel

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:03.639 
this Jimmy I'm going to add a camel
coming<00:01:01.430> in<00:01:01.640> when<00:01:02.000> the<00:01:02.090> weight<00:01:02.239> change<00:01:02.449> ends<00:01:02.750> so

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.649 
coming in when the weight change ends so

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:11.260 
coming in when the weight change ends so
i<00:01:03.710> have<00:01:03.859> 1<00:01:05.110> 2<00:01:06.110> 3<00:01:06.789> 4<00:01:09.250> from<00:01:10.250> here<00:01:10.580> my<00:01:10.789> arms<00:01:11.119> will

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
i have 1 2 3 4 from here my arms will

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.630 
i have 1 2 3 4 from here my arms will
come<00:01:11.690> down<00:01:11.930> next<00:01:12.170> to<00:01:12.350> my<00:01:12.440> face<00:01:12.679> and<00:01:12.950> the<00:01:13.399> shimmy

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
come down next to my face and the shimmy

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.320 
come down next to my face and the shimmy
continues<00:01:14.090> this<00:01:14.780> time<00:01:15.140> with<00:01:15.470> for<00:01:15.740> chest<00:01:16.009> drops

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
continues this time with for chest drops

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.550 
continues this time with for chest drops
one<00:01:17.330> two<00:01:18.310> three<00:01:19.310> four<00:01:20.300> continuing<00:01:21.050> four<00:01:21.289> more

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
one two three four continuing four more

00:01:21.560 --> 00:03:00.730 
one two three four continuing four more
counts<00:01:21.740> one<00:01:22.670> two<00:01:23.679> three<00:01:24.679> four

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740
