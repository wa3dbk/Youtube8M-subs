00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.810 

in<00:00:18.320> this<00:00:18.560> video<00:00:18.890> I'm<00:00:19.250> going<00:00:19.520> to<00:00:19.640> be

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 
in this video I'm going to be

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.089 
in this video I'm going to be
demonstrating<00:00:20.599> how<00:00:20.840> to<00:00:20.869> avoid<00:00:21.289> miss<00:00:21.590> shifting

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:22.099 
demonstrating how to avoid miss shifting

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:26.939 
demonstrating how to avoid miss shifting
and<00:00:22.340> how<00:00:23.210> to<00:00:23.270> rep<00:00:23.539> match<00:00:24.550> miss<00:00:25.550> shifting<00:00:26.000> is

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:26.949 
and how to rep match miss shifting is

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:29.350 
and how to rep match miss shifting is
when<00:00:27.949> you<00:00:28.070> go<00:00:28.220> for<00:00:28.489> a<00:00:28.520> certain<00:00:28.759> gear<00:00:29.060> like

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:29.360 
when you go for a certain gear like

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.749 
when you go for a certain gear like
going<00:00:29.630> from<00:00:29.720> second<00:00:30.169> third<00:00:30.439> and<00:00:30.759> you

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
going from second third and you

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.430 
going from second third and you
accidentally<00:00:32.390> go<00:00:32.540> from<00:00:32.720> second<00:00:33.110> to<00:00:33.199> fifth

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
accidentally go from second to fifth

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.439 
accidentally go from second to fifth
that's<00:00:36.440> just<00:00:36.710> an<00:00:36.830> example<00:00:37.250> and<00:00:37.550> rep<00:00:37.970> matching

00:00:38.439 --> 00:00:38.449 
that's just an example and rep matching

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:43.270 
that's just an example and rep matching
is<00:00:40.210> basically<00:00:41.210> trying<00:00:41.900> to<00:00:42.070> release<00:00:43.070> the

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
is basically trying to release the

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.520 
is basically trying to release the
clutch<00:00:43.519> at<00:00:43.850> the<00:00:44.059> exact<00:00:44.449> revs<00:00:44.780> that<00:00:45.079> are<00:00:45.199> needed

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
clutch at the exact revs that are needed

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.470 
clutch at the exact revs that are needed
for<00:00:45.769> that<00:00:45.829> speed<00:00:46.309> in<00:00:46.579> that<00:00:46.610> gear<00:00:47.030> so<00:00:47.269> if<00:00:47.360> you're

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
for that speed in that gear so if you're

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.039 
for that speed in that gear so if you're
going<00:00:47.629> from<00:00:47.750> third<00:00:48.019> to<00:00:48.050> fourth<00:00:49.390> then<00:00:50.390> you<00:00:50.869> need

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:51.049 
going from third to fourth then you need

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:52.570 
going from third to fourth then you need
the<00:00:51.170> reps<00:00:51.350> to<00:00:51.470> drop<00:00:51.650> a<00:00:51.680> certain<00:00:52.040> amount<00:00:52.280> and

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:52.580 
the reps to drop a certain amount and

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.700 
the reps to drop a certain amount and
then<00:00:52.820> let<00:00:52.970> go<00:00:53.000> of<00:00:53.150> the<00:00:53.239> clutch<00:00:53.500> but<00:00:54.500> if<00:00:54.589> you're

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
then let go of the clutch but if you're

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:55.689 
then let go of the clutch but if you're
going<00:00:54.830> from<00:00:54.979> fourth<00:00:55.309> to<00:00:55.369> third

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
going from fourth to third

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:57.340 
going from fourth to third
then<00:00:56.119> you<00:00:56.239> need<00:00:56.390> to<00:00:56.479> raise<00:00:56.629> the<00:00:56.869> revs<00:00:57.080> while

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
then you need to raise the revs while

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.649 
then you need to raise the revs while
shifting<00:00:57.670> to<00:00:58.670> get<00:00:58.820> it<00:00:58.939> to<00:00:59.030> line<00:00:59.210> just<00:00:59.420> right

00:00:59.649 --> 00:00:59.659 
shifting to get it to line just right

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:03.820 
shifting to get it to line just right
just<00:01:00.439> where<00:01:00.710> you<00:01:00.830> want<00:01:01.010> it<00:01:01.100> to<00:01:01.189> be<00:01:01.339> so<00:01:02.619> easy<00:01:03.619> way

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
just where you want it to be so easy way

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.980 
just where you want it to be so easy way
to<00:01:03.890> avoid<00:01:04.189> miss<00:01:04.489> shifting

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.140 

sideways<00:01:07.770> pressure<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.340> left<00:01:08.550> from<00:01:08.790> first<00:01:09.030> a

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
sideways pressure the left from first a

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.850 
sideways pressure the left from first a
second<00:01:09.570> you'll<00:01:09.750> pull<00:01:09.990> straight<00:01:10.290> down<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.620> go

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
second you'll pull straight down and go

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.120 
second you'll pull straight down and go
straight<00:01:11.190> into<00:01:11.400> second<00:01:12.740> if<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:13.860> want<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.070> go

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
straight into second if you want to go

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.190 
straight into second if you want to go
to<00:01:14.220> third<00:01:14.460> you'll<00:01:15.000> push<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.390> out<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.630> gear<00:01:15.990> into

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
to third you'll push it out of gear into

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.220 
to third you'll push it out of gear into
neutral<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.890> then<00:01:17.040> into<00:01:17.280> third<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:18.300> okay<00:01:18.780> it's

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:19.230 
neutral and then into third so okay it's

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:20.810 
neutral and then into third so okay it's
kind<00:01:19.440> of<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.590> two-step<00:01:19.770> process

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
kind of a two-step process

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.149 
kind of a two-step process
push<00:01:21.180> word<00:01:21.510> push<00:01:22.080> forward<00:01:22.410> again

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
push word push forward again

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.160 
push word push forward again
go<00:01:24.939> straight<00:01:25.149> into<00:01:25.329> third<00:01:25.630> from<00:01:25.899> third<00:01:26.140> to

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
go straight into third from third to

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.380 
go straight into third from third to
fourth<00:01:26.619> there's<00:01:26.979> a<00:01:27.039> straight<00:01:27.280> shot<00:01:27.579> so

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
fourth there's a straight shot so

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.789 
fourth there's a straight shot so
they'll<00:01:28.539> go<00:01:28.659> straight<00:01:29.409> down<00:01:31.649> going<00:01:32.649> from

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
they'll go straight down going from

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:34.649 
they'll go straight down going from
fourth<00:01:33.039> to<00:01:33.130> fifth<00:01:33.360> you're<00:01:34.360> going<00:01:34.479> to<00:01:34.539> need

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
fourth to fifth you're going to need

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.749 
fourth to fifth you're going to need
pressure<00:01:34.930> to<00:01:35.170> the<00:01:35.259> right<00:01:35.470> so<00:01:36.369> this<00:01:36.490> is<00:01:36.549> an

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
pressure to the right so this is an

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:39.090 
pressure to the right so this is an
extreme<00:01:37.119> example<00:01:37.240> pressure<00:01:38.229> the<00:01:38.560> right<00:01:38.740> you

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
extreme example pressure the right you

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.020 
extreme example pressure the right you
push<00:01:39.310> forward<00:01:39.610> and<00:01:39.909> it<00:01:40.030> goes<00:01:40.179> exactly<00:01:40.689> to<00:01:41.140> fit

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
push forward and it goes exactly to fit

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.240 
push forward and it goes exactly to fit
and<00:01:43.030> then<00:01:43.350> again<00:01:44.350> if<00:01:44.530> you<00:01:44.649> have<00:01:44.799> a<00:01:44.829> six<00:01:45.069> beat

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
and then again if you have a six beat

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.870 
and then again if you have a six beat
card<00:01:45.549> then<00:01:46.710> you'll<00:01:47.710> keep<00:01:47.860> pressure<00:01:48.130> right<00:01:48.579> and

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
card then you'll keep pressure right and

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.460 
card then you'll keep pressure right and
pull<00:01:49.090> straight<00:01:49.210> down<00:01:49.539> and<00:01:49.750> you'll<00:01:49.899> end<00:01:50.289> up<00:01:50.350> in

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
pull straight down and you'll end up in

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:56.030 
pull straight down and you'll end up in
sixth<00:01:50.770> gear

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.070 

some<00:01:56.610> people<00:01:56.850> will<00:01:56.970> try<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.150> maneuver<00:01:57.480> it

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
some people will try to maneuver it

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.219 
some people will try to maneuver it
one<00:01:59.500> second<00:01:59.890> third

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
one second third

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.080 

and<00:02:02.590> they'll<00:02:02.829> accidentally<00:02:03.399> get<00:02:03.549> fit<00:02:03.789> and

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
and they'll accidentally get fit and

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.050 
and they'll accidentally get fit and
I'll<00:02:04.180> demonstrate<00:02:04.360> that<00:02:04.719> now

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.330 

throw<00:02:07.659> from<00:02:07.780> second<00:02:08.289> now<00:02:08.860> trying<00:02:09.130> to<00:02:09.160> go<00:02:09.250> to

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
throw from second now trying to go to

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.040 
throw from second now trying to go to
third<00:02:09.550> so<00:02:09.850> I'll<00:02:10.000> push<00:02:10.179> it<00:02:10.209> out<00:02:10.420> and<00:02:10.630> maneuver

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
third so I'll push it out and maneuver

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.300 
third so I'll push it out and maneuver
it<00:02:11.140> to<00:02:11.290> the<00:02:11.380> right<00:02:11.560> a<00:02:11.590> little<00:02:11.770> bit

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
it to the right a little bit

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.100 
it to the right a little bit
and<00:02:12.670> try<00:02:12.819> to<00:02:12.880> put<00:02:13.060> it<00:02:13.150> in<00:02:13.240> a<00:02:13.270> third<00:02:13.540> but<00:02:13.810> instead

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
and try to put it in a third but instead

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:24.960 
and try to put it in a third but instead
I'll<00:02:14.319> do<00:02:14.500> this<00:02:14.709> and<00:02:15.580> go<00:02:15.700> into<00:02:15.819> fifth

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.030 

pretty<00:02:25.570> easy<00:02:25.750> way<00:02:26.020> to<00:02:26.080> avoid<00:02:26.380> miss<00:02:26.650> shifting

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
pretty easy way to avoid miss shifting

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.220 
pretty easy way to avoid miss shifting
so<00:02:27.520> now<00:02:27.880> let's<00:02:28.120> demonstrate<00:02:28.330> rev-matching

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
so now let's demonstrate rev-matching

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.800 
so now let's demonstrate rev-matching
when<00:02:29.980> going<00:02:30.280> upwards<00:02:30.670> and<00:02:30.790> gears<00:02:31.090> you<00:02:31.630> need

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
when going upwards and gears you need

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.290 
when going upwards and gears you need
these<00:02:32.410> rpms<00:02:33.040> to<00:02:33.220> only<00:02:33.400> drop<00:02:33.700> a<00:02:33.730> certain<00:02:34.120> amount

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
these rpms to only drop a certain amount

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.670 
these rpms to only drop a certain amount
you<00:02:34.540> don't<00:02:34.720> want<00:02:34.870> them<00:02:34.990> to<00:02:35.110> drop<00:02:35.290> all<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.590> way

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
you don't want them to drop all the way

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.870 
you don't want them to drop all the way
back<00:02:35.860> down<00:02:35.890> to<00:02:36.280> idle

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
back down to idle

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.710 
back down to idle
so<00:02:37.800> say<00:02:38.800> I'm<00:02:38.860> at<00:02:39.040> 3000<00:02:39.760> right<00:02:39.910> now<00:02:40.060> more<00:02:40.570> or

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
so say I'm at 3000 right now more or

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.950 
so say I'm at 3000 right now more or
less<00:02:40.870> and<00:02:41.560> when<00:02:41.680> I<00:02:41.710> go<00:02:41.830> to<00:02:41.890> fourth<00:02:42.660> when<00:02:43.660> I<00:02:43.690> let

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:43.960 
less and when I go to fourth when I let

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.470 
less and when I go to fourth when I let
go<00:02:43.990> of<00:02:44.260> it<00:02:44.350> it<00:02:44.740> landed<00:02:45.130> exactly<00:02:45.280> at<00:02:45.730> about<00:02:45.940> 23

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
go of it it landed exactly at about 23

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.830 
go of it it landed exactly at about 23
and<00:02:47.010> I<00:02:48.010> felt<00:02:48.280> no<00:02:48.460> jolt<00:02:48.820> in<00:02:49.030> between<00:02:49.420> and<00:02:49.630> I<00:02:49.660> let

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
and I felt no jolt in between and I let

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.630 
and I felt no jolt in between and I let
go<00:02:49.990> of<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.170> clutch<00:02:50.380> completely<00:02:51.220> before<00:02:51.580> I

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
go of the clutch completely before I

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.060 
go of the clutch completely before I
started<00:02:52.120> touching<00:02:52.330> the<00:02:52.600> gas<00:02:52.750> pedal<00:02:53.110> again<00:02:53.380> you

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
started touching the gas pedal again you

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.440 
started touching the gas pedal again you
always<00:02:54.310> want<00:02:54.490> to<00:02:54.520> make<00:02:54.670> sure<00:02:54.700> to<00:02:54.910> do<00:02:55.060> that

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
always want to make sure to do that

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.490 
always want to make sure to do that
and<00:02:56.200> so<00:02:56.410> again

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.420 

about<00:02:59.770> three

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.640 

any<00:03:03.000> landed<00:03:03.390> just<00:03:03.510> right<00:03:03.780> no<00:03:03.959> Joel<00:03:04.230> Tino

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
any landed just right no Joel Tino

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.220 
any landed just right no Joel Tino
nothing<00:03:05.150> and<00:03:06.150> you'll<00:03:06.299> notice<00:03:06.599> some<00:03:06.780> gears<00:03:07.049> are

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
nothing and you'll notice some gears are

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.750 
nothing and you'll notice some gears are
closer<00:03:07.470> than<00:03:07.739> others<00:03:07.829> you'll<00:03:08.250> notice<00:03:08.519> that<00:03:08.640> in

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
closer than others you'll notice that in

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.100 
closer than others you'll notice that in
the<00:03:08.879> lower<00:03:09.060> gears<00:03:09.420> there's<00:03:09.629> a<00:03:09.689> bigger

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
the lower gears there's a bigger

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.670 
the lower gears there's a bigger
difference<00:03:10.379> between<00:03:11.150> rpms<00:03:12.150> and<00:03:12.989> in<00:03:13.409> higher

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
difference between rpms and in higher

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.250 
difference between rpms and in higher
speeds<00:03:14.040> like<00:03:14.280> from<00:03:14.489> 56<00:03:15.090> there's<00:03:15.870> not<00:03:16.049> as<00:03:16.140> much

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
speeds like from 56 there's not as much

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.470 
speeds like from 56 there's not as much
of<00:03:16.319> a<00:03:16.470> difference

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.380 

but<00:03:20.340> downshifting<00:03:21.340> you'll<00:03:21.879> have<00:03:22.060> to<00:03:22.209> read<00:03:22.360> a

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
but downshifting you'll have to read a

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.470 
but downshifting you'll have to read a
little<00:03:22.690> bit<00:03:22.810> during<00:03:23.379> the<00:03:23.470> shift<00:03:24.090> to<00:03:25.090> get<00:03:25.209> it<00:03:25.360> to

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
little bit during the shift to get it to

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.210 
little bit during the shift to get it to
land<00:03:25.660> where<00:03:25.870> you<00:03:25.900> wanted<00:03:26.230> to<00:03:26.290> i'm<00:03:26.530> in<00:03:26.620> 2000

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
land where you wanted to i'm in 2000

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.370 
land where you wanted to i'm in 2000
right<00:03:27.310> now

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
right now

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.970 
right now
and<00:03:29.860> it<00:03:29.980> landed<00:03:30.130> about<00:03:30.430> 24

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.420 

and<00:03:34.340> now<00:03:34.520> do<00:03:34.640> it<00:03:34.910> again<00:03:34.970> from<00:03:35.420> four<00:03:35.810> to<00:03:35.840> third

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.400 

no<00:03:39.760> jolting

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.070 

and<00:03:42.950> as<00:03:43.820> you<00:03:43.940> get<00:03:44.120> lower<00:03:44.300> in<00:03:44.450> gears<00:03:44.780> like<00:03:44.990> I

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 
and as you get lower in gears like I

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.360 
and as you get lower in gears like I
said<00:03:45.290> you'll<00:03:45.500> notice<00:03:45.830> there's<00:03:46.010> more<00:03:46.190> of<00:03:46.310> a

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
said you'll notice there's more of a

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.930 
said you'll notice there's more of a
difference<00:03:46.790> in<00:03:47.510> rpms<00:03:48.250> going<00:03:49.250> from<00:03:49.430> seconds<00:03:49.850> of

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
difference in rpms going from seconds of

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.820 
difference in rpms going from seconds of
first<00:03:50.180> is<00:03:50.390> always<00:03:50.690> a<00:03:50.720> tough<00:03:50.990> one<00:03:51.230> because<00:03:51.560> of

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
first is always a tough one because of

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.190 
first is always a tough one because of
the<00:03:51.890> big<00:03:52.070> difference<00:03:52.640> in<00:03:52.760> rpms<00:03:53.240> and<00:03:53.720> not<00:03:53.960> just

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
the big difference in rpms and not just

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.590 
the big difference in rpms and not just
that<00:03:54.350> but<00:03:54.770> you<00:03:55.640> don't<00:03:55.820> want<00:03:56.000> to<00:03:56.060> wear<00:03:56.210> out<00:03:56.390> the

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
that but you don't want to wear out the

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.390 
that but you don't want to wear out the
first<00:03:56.840> gear<00:03:57.050> syncro<00:03:57.560> you'll<00:03:57.770> notice<00:03:58.040> if<00:03:58.280> you

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
first gear syncro you'll notice if you

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.890 
first gear syncro you'll notice if you
try<00:03:58.580> to<00:03:58.640> just<00:03:58.880> shift<00:03:59.120> from<00:03:59.240> second<00:03:59.630> to<00:03:59.660> first

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
try to just shift from second to first

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.120 
try to just shift from second to first
while<00:04:00.200> you're<00:04:00.320> still<00:04:00.530> moving<00:04:00.650> at<00:04:00.920> a<00:04:00.950> good

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
while you're still moving at a good

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.040 
while you're still moving at a good
speed<00:04:01.340> like<00:04:01.550> this<00:04:01.760> it's<00:04:02.450> actually<00:04:02.840> pretty

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
speed like this it's actually pretty

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.760 
speed like this it's actually pretty
difficult

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:03.770 
difficult

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:05.290 
difficult
it<00:04:04.010> feels<00:04:04.220> really<00:04:04.430> stiff<00:04:04.790> and<00:04:04.820> it<00:04:05.030> doesn't

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
it feels really stiff and it doesn't

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.500 
it feels really stiff and it doesn't
want<00:04:05.390> to<00:04:05.450> go<00:04:05.570> in<00:04:05.750> but<00:04:06.520> if<00:04:07.520> you<00:04:07.730> have<00:04:08.000> match<00:04:08.240> it

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
want to go in but if you have match it

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.130 
want to go in but if you have match it
it<00:04:08.900> should<00:04:09.140> go<00:04:09.320> in<00:04:09.470> relatively<00:04:09.950> smoothly

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
it should go in relatively smoothly

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.890 
it should go in relatively smoothly
and<00:04:12.700> you'll<00:04:13.700> need<00:04:13.880> a<00:04:13.940> double<00:04:14.330> clutching<00:04:14.720> which

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
and you'll need a double clutching which

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.140 
and you'll need a double clutching which
I'll<00:04:15.080> explain<00:04:15.440> in<00:04:15.710> another<00:04:15.770> video<00:04:16.280> but<00:04:16.940> it's

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
I'll explain in another video but it's

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.460 
I'll explain in another video but it's
essentially<00:04:17.870> the<00:04:17.959> same<00:04:18.019> thing

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
essentially the same thing

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.170 
essentially the same thing
as<00:04:19.950> what<00:04:20.280> we've<00:04:20.430> been<00:04:20.549> doing<00:04:20.820> with<00:04:20.970> the<00:04:21.000> other

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
as what we've been doing with the other

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.900 
as what we've been doing with the other
years<00:04:21.570> going<00:04:21.989> upward<00:04:22.350> you<00:04:23.100> let<00:04:23.250> the<00:04:23.370> revs<00:04:23.550> drop

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
years going upward you let the revs drop

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.570 
years going upward you let the revs drop
just<00:04:24.210> enough<00:04:24.740> and<00:04:25.740> going<00:04:26.040> down<00:04:26.220> where<00:04:26.520> the

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
just enough and going down where the

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:35.149 
just enough and going down where the
gears<00:04:27.200> you<00:04:28.200> rev<00:04:28.410> it<00:04:28.440> a<00:04:28.560> little<00:04:28.740> bit

00:04:35.149 --> 00:04:35.159 

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:47.060 

so<00:04:35.459> that<00:04:35.610> it<00:04:35.729> feels<00:04:35.849> smooth<00:04:36.209> during<00:04:36.599> shifting

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.890 

so<00:04:47.640> that's<00:04:47.820> an<00:04:47.940> easy<00:04:48.090> way<00:04:48.300> to<00:04:48.360> avoid<00:04:48.510> miss

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
so that's an easy way to avoid miss

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.180 
so that's an easy way to avoid miss
shifts<00:04:49.460> and<00:04:50.460> had<00:04:50.670> a<00:04:50.700> rep<00:04:50.940> match
