00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
have connects to this brown sack well

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.780 
have connects to this brown sack well
it's<00:00:37.540> here<00:00:37.719> now<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.800> Browns<00:00:39.190> have<00:00:39.370> connected

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
it's here now the Browns have connected

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.569 
it's here now the Browns have connected
this<00:00:39.940> brown<00:00:40.180> tab<00:00:40.480> and<00:00:40.930> the<00:00:41.890> black<00:00:42.219> tab

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
this brown tab and the black tab

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:45.540 
this brown tab and the black tab
connects<00:00:43.149> to<00:00:43.239> this<00:00:43.420> and<00:00:43.809> even<00:00:44.800> if<00:00:45.039> you<00:00:45.280> color

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
connects to this and even if you color

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.160 
connects to this and even if you color
blind<00:00:45.850> can<00:00:46.000> go<00:00:46.300> wrong<00:00:46.539> because<00:00:46.809> I<00:00:47.020> actually

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
blind can go wrong because I actually

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.779 
blind can go wrong because I actually
the<00:00:47.440> great<00:00:47.649> tab<00:00:47.890> off<00:00:48.160> and<00:00:48.430> it<00:00:48.550> wouldn't<00:00:48.730> even

00:00:48.779 --> 00:00:48.789 
the great tab off and it wouldn't even

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:52.590 
the great tab off and it wouldn't even
fit<00:00:48.910> so<00:00:49.809> Nani<00:00:50.140> tabs<00:00:50.469> actually<00:00:50.800> fit<00:00:51.239> just<00:00:52.239> into

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
fit so Nani tabs actually fit just into

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.540 
fit so Nani tabs actually fit just into
them<00:00:52.870> in<00:00:52.989> the<00:00:53.140> right<00:00:53.350> no<00:00:53.770> socket<00:00:54.329> so<00:00:56.399> we<00:00:57.399> got

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
them in the right no socket so we got

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.939 
them in the right no socket so we got
this<00:00:57.670> in<00:00:57.940> now<00:00:58.270> I<00:00:58.660> probably<00:00:59.379> should<00:00:59.680> show<00:00:59.890> you

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
this in now I probably should show you

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:04.500 
this in now I probably should show you
just<00:01:00.250> these<00:01:01.120> three<00:01:01.390> wires<00:01:01.570> here<00:01:02.160> if<00:01:03.330> you<00:01:04.330> want

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
just these three wires here if you want

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:05.789 
just these three wires here if you want
to<00:01:04.570> look<00:01:04.629> out<00:01:04.839> your<00:01:04.869> backup<00:01:05.320> camera<00:01:05.350> so<00:01:05.710> you

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
to look out your backup camera so you

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:08.100 
to look out your backup camera so you
can<00:01:05.890> see<00:01:06.189> the<00:01:06.369> back<00:01:06.520> of<00:01:06.549> camera<00:01:07.060> you<00:01:07.780> know<00:01:07.960> in

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
can see the back of camera you know in

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.780 
can see the back of camera you know in
motion<00:01:08.590> like<00:01:09.549> driving<00:01:09.909> forward<00:01:10.420> or<00:01:10.770> whatever

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
motion like driving forward or whatever

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.480 
motion like driving forward or whatever
um<00:01:12.790> I<00:01:12.960> don't<00:01:13.960> really<00:01:14.229> use<00:01:14.740> my<00:01:14.890> backup<00:01:15.189> camera

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
um I don't really use my backup camera

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.490 
um I don't really use my backup camera
just<00:01:15.670> a<00:01:15.909> lot<00:01:16.420> useful<00:01:16.780> as<00:01:16.840> a<00:01:16.869> backing<00:01:17.140> up<00:01:17.320> that's

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
just a lot useful as a backing up that's

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.200 
just a lot useful as a backing up that's
what<00:01:17.650> I'm<00:01:17.770> pulling<00:01:18.070> my<00:01:18.220> my<00:01:18.670> trailer<00:01:19.000> without

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
what I'm pulling my my trailer without

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.840
