without<00:01:28.170> battery<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:29.310> can't<00:01:29.549> recharge<00:01:29.700> at

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
without battery you can't recharge at

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.450 
without battery you can't recharge at
all<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:31.020> doesn't<00:01:31.320> have<00:01:31.439> any<00:01:31.710> capacity<00:01:31.920> to

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
all so it doesn't have any capacity to

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.749 
all so it doesn't have any capacity to
it<00:01:33.799> all<00:01:34.799> right<00:01:34.860> there<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.430> go<00:01:35.750> the<00:01:36.750> RAM<00:01:37.049> is

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
it all right there you go the RAM is

I can actually install this in my imac
but<00:02:14.750> you<00:02:14.959> can't<00:02:15.200> manually<00:02:15.500> do<00:02:15.739> it<00:02:15.890> so<00:02:16.129> sucks

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:16.609 
but you can't manually do it so sucks

for me all right come on open this since
off<00:02:22.459> its<00:02:22.760> flash<00:02:23.120> storage<00:02:23.709> it's<00:02:24.709> going<00:02:24.920> to<00:02:24.950> be

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
off its flash storage it's going to be

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.929 
off its flash storage it's going to be
amazingly<00:02:26.060> fast<00:02:26.390> hopefully<00:02:26.840> and<00:02:27.730> this<00:02:28.730> is

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:28.939 
amazingly fast hopefully and this is

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:33.369 
amazingly fast hopefully and this is
obviously<00:02:29.569> the<00:02:29.900> adapter<00:02:30.470> for<00:02:30.620> it<00:02:31.060> and<00:02:32.379> the

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 
obviously the adapter for it and the

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:37.599 
obviously the adapter for it and the
hard<00:02:33.590> drive<00:02:33.769> itself<00:02:34.450> voila<00:02:36.340> go<00:02:37.340> ahead<00:02:37.579> and

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:37.609 
hard drive itself voila go ahead and

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:41.319 
hard drive itself voila go ahead and
take<00:02:38.359> this<00:02:38.510> up<00:02:38.750> yay<00:02:40.000> all<00:02:41.000> right<00:02:41.060> this<00:02:41.269> is

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:41.329 
take this up yay all right this is

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:43.119 
take this up yay all right this is

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:43.129 
content sensitive to electrostatic

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:47.339 
content sensitive to electrostatic
discharge<00:02:43.969> so<00:02:44.750> open<00:02:45.200> well<00:02:45.739> at<00:02:46.159> a<00:02:46.220> static<00:02:46.849> free

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
discharge so open well at a static free

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:57.670 
discharge so open well at a static free
or<00:02:48.349> station<00:02:48.799> I'm<00:02:49.299> fine<00:02:53.200> right<00:02:56.260> see<00:02:57.260> compared

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
or station I'm fine right see compared

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.649 
or station I'm fine right see compared
to<00:02:57.769> this<00:02:57.889> it's<00:02:58.159> obviously<00:02:58.669> the<00:02:58.819> same<00:02:59.000> size<00:03:00.370> 2.5

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:01.659 
to this it's obviously the same size 2.5

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:06.720 
to this it's obviously the same size 2.5

intel core duo two gigahertz
unfortunately<00:04:46.440> that's<00:04:46.770> why<00:04:47.070> it's<00:04:47.250> pretty

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
unfortunately that's why it's pretty

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.779 
unfortunately that's why it's pretty
slow<00:04:48.539> but<00:04:48.780> I<00:04:49.020> have<00:04:49.650> a<00:04:49.740> feeling<00:04:49.919> that<00:04:50.100> the<00:04:50.580> hard

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:50.789 
slow but I have a feeling that the hard

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:52.460 
slow but I have a feeling that the hard
drive<00:04:51.000> is<00:04:51.150> going<00:04:51.300> to<00:04:51.360> make<00:04:51.510> a<00:04:51.750> huge<00:04:52.289> huge

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
drive is going to make a huge huge

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.680 
drive is going to make a huge huge
difference<00:04:53.449> with<00:04:54.449> this<00:04:54.660> let's<00:04:55.530> go
