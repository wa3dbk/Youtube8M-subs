shoulders<00:02:45.430> up<00:02:45.550> and<00:02:45.700> let's<00:02:46.030> go<00:02:46.120> for<00:02:46.300> phase<00:02:46.450> 4<00:02:46.480> I

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
shoulders up and let's go for phase 4 I

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.450 
shoulders up and let's go for phase 4 I
preferred<00:02:46.870> my<00:02:46.990> shoulders<00:02:47.350> a<00:02:47.500> bit<00:02:47.560> more<00:02:48.130> free

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460

that's<00:03:24.640> his<00:03:24.790> spark<00:03:25.150> ik<00:03:25.390> then<00:03:25.690> if<00:03:25.780> you<00:03:25.840> can

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
that's his spark ik then if you can

articulation<00:03:47.610> things<00:03:48.610> that<00:03:48.790> you<00:03:48.910> pretty<00:03:49.150> well

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
articulation things that you pretty well

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:49.979 
articulation things that you pretty well
are<00:03:49.480> today

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
are today

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.860 
are today
now<00:03:50.200> I<00:03:50.230> actually<00:03:50.709> carved<00:03:51.400> all<00:03:51.730> of<00:03:51.970> this<00:03:52.150> out

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
now I actually carved all of this out

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.479 
now I actually carved all of this out
because<00:03:53.470> this<00:03:53.680> was<00:03:53.800> just<00:03:53.980> like<00:03:54.070> this<00:03:54.190> big

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
because this was just like this big

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.270 
because this was just like this big
thick<00:03:55.150> ball<00:03:55.630> can<00:03:55.900> I<00:03:55.930> pick<00:03:56.230> up<00:03:56.410> a<00:03:56.560> large<00:03:56.860> heavy

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
thick ball can I pick up a large heavy

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.780 
thick ball can I pick up a large heavy
and<00:03:58.180> every<00:03:58.540> flex<00:03:58.900> at<00:03:59.170> all<00:03:59.200> so<00:03:59.500> I<00:03:59.590> actually<00:03:59.790> got

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
and every flex at all so I actually got

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.729 
and every flex at all so I actually got
a<00:04:00.850> knife<00:04:01.030> just<00:04:01.300> strimm<00:04:01.870> did<00:04:02.170> all<00:04:02.290> that<00:04:02.440> looks<00:04:02.650> a

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
a knife just strimm did all that looks a

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:04.440 
a knife just strimm did all that looks a
bit<00:04:02.769> rough<00:04:03.040> inside<00:04:03.640> but<00:04:04.000> you<00:04:04.060> know<00:04:04.180> it<00:04:04.330> gives

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
bit rough inside but you know it gives

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.449 
bit rough inside but you know it gives
it<00:04:04.600> more<00:04:04.630> freedom<00:04:05.350> to<00:04:05.380> move<00:04:05.739> it's<00:04:06.160> not<00:04:06.220> so

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
it more freedom to move it's not so
