now you don't see me do it at all during
this<00:00:48.170> walkthrough<00:00:48.410> because<00:00:48.739> I<00:00:48.859> only<00:00:49.010> focus<00:00:49.460> on

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
this walkthrough because I only focus on

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.910 
this walkthrough because I only focus on
the<00:00:49.609> heretic<00:00:50.059> but<00:00:50.989> probably<00:00:51.379> on<00:00:51.469> an<00:00:51.589> easier

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
the heretic but probably on an easier

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.099 
the heretic but probably on an easier
difficulty<00:00:52.280> you<00:00:52.579> could<00:00:52.760> actually<00:00:53.329> I<00:00:53.600> know<00:00:53.960> you

00:00:54.099 --> 00:00:54.109 
difficulty you could actually I know you

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:55.869 
difficulty you could actually I know you
can<00:00:54.440> you<00:00:54.710> can<00:00:54.739> hit<00:00:55.100> these<00:00:55.280> guys<00:00:55.519> with

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
can you can hit these guys with

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:57.279 
can you can hit these guys with
everything<00:00:56.059> but<00:00:56.390> cross<00:00:56.659> attacks<00:00:57.050> while

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
everything but cross attacks while

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:59.889 
everything but cross attacks while
they're<00:00:57.500> under<00:00:58.370> that<00:00:58.460> spell<00:00:58.789> but<00:00:59.180> I<00:00:59.420> find<00:00:59.780> it

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
they're under that spell but I find it

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.100 
they're under that spell but I find it
just<00:01:00.019> easier<00:01:00.500> to<00:01:01.420> take<00:01:02.420> down<00:01:02.479> the<00:01:02.750> heretic

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
just easier to take down the heretic

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.350 
just easier to take down the heretic
