bit<00:00:48.860> oh<00:00:49.070> okay<00:00:49.610> well<00:00:49.730> first<00:00:49.910> of<00:00:50.090> all<00:00:50.180> radians

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
bit oh okay well first of all radians

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.880 
bit oh okay well first of all radians
actually<00:00:52.579> too<00:00:52.910> that's<00:00:53.899> fully<00:00:54.140> charged<00:00:54.710> and<00:00:54.890> is

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
actually too that's fully charged and is

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.560 
actually too that's fully charged and is
forward<00:00:57.890> spring<00:00:58.489> you<00:00:58.640> see<00:00:58.760> a<00:00:58.790> lot<00:00:58.970> 5<00:00:59.239> frame<00:00:59.420> for

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
forward spring you see a lot 5 frame for

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.210 
forward spring you see a lot 5 frame for
with<00:00:59.660> one<00:00:59.780> yeah<00:00:59.930> back<00:01:00.110> to<00:01:00.140> that<00:01:00.860> builds<00:01:01.070> about

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220 
with one yeah back to that builds about

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.680 
with one yeah back to that builds about
fifty<00:01:01.430> percent<00:01:01.460> of<00:01:01.730> a<00:01:01.820> bottom<00:01:02.059> block<00:01:02.210> yes

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
fifty percent of a bottom block yes

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.200 
fifty percent of a bottom block yes
these<00:01:03.200> other<00:01:03.380> strings<00:01:03.680> that<00:01:03.829> build<00:01:04.180> 75%<00:01:05.180> of

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
these other strings that build 75% of

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.480 
these other strings that build 75% of
the<00:01:05.299> wrong<00:01:05.479> unblock<00:01:06.469> are<00:01:06.680> actually<00:01:07.340> in

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
the wrong unblock are actually in

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.310 
the wrong unblock are actually in
there's<00:01:07.700> an<00:01:07.939> arrow<00:01:08.180> point<00:01:08.450> we<00:01:08.600> just<00:01:09.110> hit<00:01:09.259> him

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
there's an arrow point we just hit him

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.350 
there's an arrow point we just hit him
out<00:01:09.500> of<00:01:09.619> it<00:01:09.710> jump<00:01:10.040> over<00:01:10.310> it<00:01:10.340> if<00:01:10.850> you<00:01:11.000> know<00:01:11.180> when

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
out of it jump over it if you know when

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.850 
out of it jump over it if you know when
he's<00:01:11.450> gonna<00:01:11.510> go<00:01:11.690> into<00:01:11.840> teleport<00:01:12.260> you<00:01:12.350> so<00:01:12.590> so<00:01:12.830> so

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
he's gonna go into teleport you so so so

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.890 
he's gonna go into teleport you so so so
but<00:01:13.370> then<00:01:13.490> you<00:01:13.670> can't<00:01:13.880> delay<00:01:14.180> it<00:01:14.210> right<00:01:14.600> to

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
but then you can't delay it right to

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.710 
but then you can't delay it right to
mess<00:01:15.260> with<00:01:15.470> them<00:01:15.590> right<00:01:15.799> you<00:01:16.159> can<00:01:16.430> depend<00:01:17.150> on

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
mess with them right you can depend on

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.200 
mess with them right you can depend on
how<00:01:17.810> many<00:01:17.870> hits<00:01:18.170> you<00:01:18.770> do<00:01:18.920> yeah<00:01:19.280> you<00:01:19.729> can<00:01:19.880> do<00:01:20.090> it

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
how many hits you do yeah you can do it

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.510 
how many hits you do yeah you can do it
off<00:01:20.330> on<00:01:20.510> two<00:01:20.780> hits<00:01:21.170> you<00:01:21.590> know<00:01:21.710> I<00:01:21.740> could<00:01:22.310> be<00:01:22.400> like

off on two hits you know I could be like
1120<00:01:23.330> to<00:01:23.510> for<00:01:23.840> like<00:01:23.960> two<00:01:24.110> or<00:01:24.140> three<00:01:24.229> hits<00:01:24.530> let's

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
1120 to for like two or three hits let's

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.890 
1120 to for like two or three hits let's
do<00:01:24.860> it<00:01:25.040> yeah<00:01:25.310> so<00:01:25.610> basically<00:01:26.240> i'm<00:01:26.479> saying<00:01:26.720> is

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.370 

yeah<00:03:10.280> this<00:03:10.520> point<00:03:10.760> I<00:03:10.820> think<00:03:10.850> I<00:03:11.390> think<00:03:12.140> it's

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
yeah this point I think I think it's

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.900 
yeah this point I think I think it's
gonna<00:03:12.470> be<00:03:12.560> hard<00:03:12.860> one<00:03:13.160> chance<00:03:13.430> here<00:03:13.580> one<00:03:13.730> chance

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
gonna be hard one chance here one chance

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:14.700 
gonna be hard one chance here one chance
gonna<00:03:14.060> go<00:03:14.120> for<00:03:14.210> the<00:03:14.270> overhead<00:03:14.540> of<00:03:14.570> low

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:14.710 
gonna go for the overhead of low

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.050 
gonna go for the overhead of low
clipping<00:03:15.710> the<00:03:15.770> overhead<00:03:16.070> that's<00:03:16.400> it<00:03:16.550> that's

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
clipping the overhead that's it that's

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.180 
clipping the overhead that's it that's
over<00:03:17.300> that<00:03:17.480> he's<00:03:17.630> dead<00:03:17.780> that's<00:03:18.080> it<00:03:18.230> no<00:03:18.860> he

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
over that he's dead that's it no he

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.680 
over that he's dead that's it no he
doesn't<00:03:19.460> oka<00:03:19.700> say<00:03:19.820> that<00:03:20.030> yeah<00:03:20.450> that's<00:03:20.570> it

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
doesn't oka say that yeah that's it

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.440 
doesn't oka say that yeah that's it
sorry<00:03:21.500> I<00:03:21.560> think<00:03:21.830> so<00:03:22.460> the<00:03:22.580> overhead<00:03:22.880> does<00:03:23.030> 54

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
sorry I think so the overhead does 54

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.790 
sorry I think so the overhead does 54
damage<00:03:23.810> but<00:03:23.960> if<00:03:24.050> you<00:03:24.110> block<00:03:24.320> that<00:03:24.350> overhead

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
damage but if you block that overhead

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.250 
damage but if you block that overhead

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.730 
got hit by the overhead twice he did not
challenge<00:04:04.190> the<00:04:04.340> overhead<00:04:04.700> now<00:04:04.730> I<00:04:04.940> believe

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:05.740

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.960 
challenge the overhead now I believe
against<00:04:06.740> that<00:04:06.920> registry<00:04:07.310> it's<00:04:07.459> best<00:04:07.640> to<00:04:07.790> go

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
against that registry it's best to go

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.360 
against that registry it's best to go
block<00:04:08.390> and<00:04:08.660> then<00:04:08.720> Stan<00:04:08.990> block<00:04:09.230> because<00:04:09.950> you

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
block and then Stan block because you

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.150 
block and then Stan block because you
can't<00:04:10.670> see<00:04:11.150> the<00:04:11.269> overhead<00:04:11.690> but<00:04:11.989> the<00:04:12.980> lowest

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
can't see the overhead but the lowest

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.840 
can't see the overhead but the lowest
art<00:04:13.430> is<00:04:13.550> faster<00:04:13.910> all<00:04:14.300> right<00:04:14.480> yeah

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.210
