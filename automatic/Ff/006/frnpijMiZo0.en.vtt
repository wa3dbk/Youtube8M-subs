 It is characterized by the preservation of 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.610
 natural resources also in 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.740
 they configure the beauty of their architecture 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.660
 the natural environment all for my mission 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.789
 so that the tourist can visit and 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.070

 the precious ones 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.340
 two 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.720
 in 2008 after he had live in 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.060
 germany for two years 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:03.210
 toni my husband and I bought the land 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:05.309
 in 2009 we started the hostel that has 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.680
 been built by ourselves with 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.050
 We open the help of local teachers 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.060
 in 2011 and currently we continue 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.010
 expanding us before the great demand that 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.690
 We had the tour and everything that we 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.420
 we have been able to build what we have 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.220
 built ourselves here with my 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.409
 person and with the help also of other 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.439
 Boys 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:27.409
 and the guys work the whole house the 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:30.109
 structure that we use is of provenance 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:35.200
 of a farm that my brother has is 

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:35.200
 pure guadua bamboo that we are using 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.880
 a little wood too that 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.690
 we found in trees fallen from a 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.460
 natural or wasted form 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.110
 We have several types of 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.380
 rooms suitable for 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.520
 Different tastes of our guests 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.040
 apart from the private rooms 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.500
 we also have shared dorms 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.240
 like the penthouse that has a charm 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.640
 special and different from others 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.680
 costs from the beginning has been 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.140
 our idea to create a different place to 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.960
 the common with a friendlier handling with 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.040
 nature and natural resources and 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.149
 inside a pretty environment 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.100
 comfortable 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.650
 we have left many parts of the 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.630
 vegetation in its natural state and 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.080
 we manage our own production of 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.040
 organically grown foods 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.190
 practicing the principles of 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.190
 permaculture 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
 Y 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:40.900
 in these moments in forgive 3600 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.900
 version 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:56.150
 tree country the volcano in cash or it 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.150
 move 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.690
 the construction is a very combination 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.690
 particular of various materials 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.140
 of the area designed at a level 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.940
 much higher than usual in the region 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.950
 a special focus within this 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.160
 project has been the use of hard water 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.770
 as an excellent ecological alternative 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.240
 that at the same time is extremely 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:20.280
 attractive when you work it with good 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:24.570
 that what we are doing here are 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.960
 Bamboo bamboo bamboo furniture is already a 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.210
 material 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:32.120
 and alternative to not use wood 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:34.370
 square the square wood that we are 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.040
 using also comes only from 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.830
 provenance of fallen trees of a 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.380
 farm that my sister has then 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.500
 we take advantage of the fallen wood we are not 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.340
 reforesting forests 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.560
 and bamboo is a 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.420
 it's something alternative as I say in 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.940
 remain known as him 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.640
 the vegetable steel that serves to 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.849
 constructions for furniture houses 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.190
 it just depends on how you work it here 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:05.050
 we see the guys who are in this 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.340
 armed moment after the very call 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:10.860
 important ecological management 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.260
 they are all our contribution 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.360
 for the conservation of the rivers of the 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.549
 region that represent colors 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.760
 attractiveness more confusion before this 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.889
 zone at the same time are very useful as 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.350
 characterize natural teas for our 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:27.810
 farm once a 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.199
 proper process in composting as 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.199
 hand 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:34.419
 We also had services 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.629
 tourism that we do in three 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:39.030
 different languages ​​Spanish English and 

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:41.790
