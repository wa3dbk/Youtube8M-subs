00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:07.290
 at 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.280
 when we were going to the university I was 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:16.970
 wash for you 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:20.119
 I felt thick the problem is that to me 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.770
 I like practically all of them if it's like 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:26.720
 if he always just got out of jail or 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:28.579
 It's a problem of queues from my party 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.020
 birthday you call me julie and she pulls me 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:32.020
 this red wine in the top of 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.800
 I'm not very focused on this maybe 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.870
 we should be just friends 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.300
 means the perfect union of 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.140
 opposites and I'll also put socks on I'm 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:51.940
 a disaster everyone 25 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.750
 producer of selection on Tuesdays and 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.670
 Friday 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.920
 but actually I'm crying for 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.629
 inside 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.800
 but I was calling to tell you that you are the 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.800
 best friend than this level 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:09.060
 it's amazing and famous I'm going to be one of 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:17.870
 those professors who inspire the one who is worth and 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:17.870
 the one who has not stopped liking 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.380
 you are going to marry 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.020
 the least text deal 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.659
 they say my career 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.960
 and the quote my friends are behind 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.960
 true 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.220
 I need to talk to someone not with 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.130
 someone not with you 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.570
 she made you better and you in return 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.570
