00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
hello there so I am filming my

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.629 
hello there so I am filming my
confessions<00:00:07.200> of<00:00:07.290> a<00:00:07.379> shopaholic<00:00:07.770> tag<00:00:08.189> now<00:00:08.460> this

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
confessions of a shopaholic tag now this

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.879 
confessions of a shopaholic tag now this
is<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:08.910> very<00:00:09.059> first<00:00:09.210> video<00:00:09.599> that<00:00:09.929> I<00:00:10.019> ever<00:00:10.200> done

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
is the very first video that I ever done

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.730 
is the very first video that I ever done
on<00:00:10.920> youtube<00:00:11.519> so<00:00:11.880> i<00:00:12.210> think<00:00:13.019> it's<00:00:13.259> time<00:00:13.500> to

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
on youtube so i think it's time to

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.189 
on youtube so i think it's time to
refill<00:00:14.070> MIT<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:14.490> actually<00:00:14.969> use<00:00:15.480> like<00:00:15.719> my<00:00:15.990> real

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
refill MIT and actually use like my real

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.800 
refill MIT and actually use like my real
camera<00:00:16.440> instead<00:00:17.039> of<00:00:17.190> my<00:00:17.279> ipad<00:00:17.670> camera<00:00:17.910> so<00:00:18.390> um

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
camera instead of my ipad camera so um

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.599 
camera instead of my ipad camera so um
actually<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.590> lot<00:00:19.740> of<00:00:19.830> things<00:00:19.890> changed<00:00:20.310> up<00:00:20.460> to

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
actually a lot of things changed up to

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.939 
actually a lot of things changed up to
so<00:00:20.760> I<00:00:20.820> figured<00:00:21.090> this<00:00:21.119> was<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.630> good<00:00:22.020> time<00:00:22.380> for<00:00:22.800> me

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
so I figured this was a good time for me

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.429 
so I figured this was a good time for me
to<00:00:23.130> start<00:00:23.939> fresh<00:00:24.180> no<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.510> me<00:00:24.689> let's<00:00:25.289> get

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
to start fresh no to me let's get

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.529 
to start fresh no to me let's get
started<00:00:25.800> so<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.369> first<00:00:26.550> question<00:00:26.609> heels<00:00:27.240> or

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
started so the first question heels or

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.660 
started so the first question heels or
flats<00:00:27.869> definitely<00:00:28.830> heals<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.310> wear<00:00:29.460> heels

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769

new pumps just because these are

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.180
