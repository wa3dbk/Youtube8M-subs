00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.920 

but<00:03:00.030> like<00:03:00.180> it<00:03:00.330> wasn't<00:03:00.600> what<00:03:00.720> I<00:03:00.750> was<00:03:00.870> expecting

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
but like it wasn't what I was expecting

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.630 
but like it wasn't what I was expecting
it<00:03:01.350> to<00:03:01.470> go<00:03:01.500> like<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.800> action<00:03:02.160> takes<00:03:02.340> really

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
it to go like the action takes really

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.090 
it to go like the action takes really
well<00:03:02.840> and<00:03:03.840> it's<00:03:04.020> actually<00:03:04.140> nice<00:03:04.770> ergonomic

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
well and it's actually nice ergonomic

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.280 
well and it's actually nice ergonomic
tool<00:03:05.670> so<00:03:06.120> I'm<00:03:06.270> in<00:03:06.420> fact<00:03:06.660> and<00:03:06.870> what's<00:03:06.900> really

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
tool so I'm in fact and what's really

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.090 
tool so I'm in fact and what's really
well<00:03:08.720> so<00:03:09.720> I<00:03:09.750> do<00:03:09.870> you<00:03:10.080> think<00:03:10.320> about<00:03:10.440> using<00:03:10.800> the

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
well so I do you think about using the

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.420 
well so I do you think about using the
beam<00:03:11.310> I<00:03:12.200> find<00:03:13.200> it<00:03:13.410> quite<00:03:13.650> easy<00:03:14.010> to<00:03:14.160> navigate

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
beam I find it quite easy to navigate

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.850 
beam I find it quite easy to navigate
and<00:03:14.910> I<00:03:15.000> also<00:03:15.480> have<00:03:15.780> this<00:03:15.930> scroll<00:03:16.350> feature<00:03:16.590> on

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
and I also have this scroll feature on

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.770 
and I also have this scroll feature on
this<00:03:17.010> side<00:03:17.220> because<00:03:17.370> i<00:03:17.610> think<00:03:17.670> it's<00:03:17.940> it's<00:03:18.480> very

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
this side because i think it's it's very

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.050 
this side because i think it's it's very
easy<00:03:18.990> access<00:03:19.500> of<00:03:19.680> your<00:03:19.920> farm<00:03:20.190> it's<00:03:20.820> more

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
easy access of your farm it's more

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.560 
easy access of your farm it's more
that's<00:03:21.990> compete<00:03:23.180> to<00:03:24.180> affordable<00:03:26.270> it<00:03:27.270> so<00:03:27.450> it

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
that's compete to affordable it so it

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.620 
that's compete to affordable it so it
was<00:03:27.780> original<00:03:28.410> and<00:03:28.910> partied<00:03:29.910> on<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.240> path<00:03:30.420> to
