00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.830
 Early access score 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:30.870
 I'm thinking of trying to try rice for a bit because this is here now 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:35.370
 Well then, it's all English though 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:40.650
 I only have to make an account, so I can not make it. 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:47.150
 It feels like I've created an account now 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:51.540
 This is I probably Nenre dm code you live in the intuition or Nde not read English uncle's

 You can game When I part of here in this give and put the code here of sound reservation benefits 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.050
 I will judge that it is not 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:08.040
 Try a little put And congratulations to cat screen Once 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:11.020
 Since leaving wonder if such that I wonder if was able to at this ok 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.470
 It changed something you can see this scene 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:17.380
 If there is about download pc 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:21.490
 It's pitch because you're doing windows for packed mountain now 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.960
 I think that want to go in the pc of client this the first time software of 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.880
 I'm going to download 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.600
 I wonder if it will take some time and after that I will try to capture the game screen with my camera 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.200
 but 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:36.850
 Mr. Uz is Elder Scrolls 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:41.920
 But I was doing a little have addicted Sky dimm ridge ps 3 edition 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:46.479
 Recently was Imaichi continue to Sukairimu of pc version 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.730
 If there is any kind of game, it will be good if Makabe sees, but it is called Hakoba Role Playing in gold 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:53.670
 It is a genre 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:56.030
 Anywhere you put advances can go to favorite Toko anywhere really wide map 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.590
 If you want to do it 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.250
 It can be a seat that can be electric play, it can also be a standing person 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.090
 The 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:09.560
 I also eat it for those who are just performing. 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:12.560
 It's just you say Tsu I do not know whether I do anything to reverse really it a high degree of freedom game 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:17.959
 I think that there are many people who say that game 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:23.490
 It seems that there are three sounds in the current Elder Scroll Online . 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:28.830
 It seems to be a story that belongs to one and let's live freely 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:34.530
 It is people who do not know English only I in the not the ones that have been translated it into Japanese 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:39.780
 Because especially this time Maybe because you have led everyone in the online contains full foreign visitors 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.500
 People who are good at English have a point where they can not enjoy it if they can not do paintings 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.270
 Like 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.660
 Something comes out variously Unso option 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:49.340
 The 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.140
 I'm not going to meet America Europe, but America 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.990
 Hey 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:03:00.819
 Since this I Sukairimu or what is also how I'm the Toka illustrations I'm a little cool 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:02.330
 It feels like rpg, but I 'm out of here in fantasy 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:09.650
 Jar archive 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:11.270

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.540

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.980
 It means that the remaining 3 days can be tried 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:21.690
 Miss is 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:27.180
 After all there is about 13 gigabyte though there is capacity 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:29.260
 I It's a little soon unreasonable is to install time-consuming Do 23 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.410
 It is the environment of the house 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.110
 Yes medicine installation is over playing 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.830
 Great variety 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.800
 There is 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:42.420
 id and Aso 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:45.410
 It's amazing it started 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.410
 Sky rim Poi 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.030
 Graphic wow 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:12.189
 It makes the character's long here a 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.189
 Shall we go to the Gale ? 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:19.280
 You can even play with an open figure 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:23.670
 This is how many times my first time grandma 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:26.889
 Um I wonder if you go like this 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:33.270
 It is a feeling that the cherry blossoms have begun 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:33.270
 So I tried The Elder Scrolls Online to try 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:52.009
 Toka fine Nde not only doing the first time Toko in Buber and following after tomorrow dog possibly waves 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:52.470
 I is operation Toka I do not know you get this day there is sound here Well I'd I English 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:58.139
 From 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:05:04.020
 If you operate with that , I think you can enjoy the matter with fans of the story for the time being 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:05.620
 One certainly in in great good thing about server of this Elder Scrolls online 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.550
 It should be put together 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:14.350
 I is Tan thought that Na that amazing when you saw in the previous article 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:17.440
 ff 4 teen and Kaato guess Toka Monster Hunter 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:23.370
 It has been aircraft What Now edition me that side 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:27.750
 I would like to know if server 1 server is pandemonium or something 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:31.870
 Since dispersing the server is doing words Tteyuu prevent congestion 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:36.760
 I can not play with my friends if the server is different 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:38.409
 But this Elder Scrolls Online is a woman who manages everything with one Sakar 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:42.289
 By become a server 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:48.919
 No matter what world you are in or whatever 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:51.110
 People people are saying anyone whether it is this game at love even went into a sound game of this child is all 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:53.930
 Share the world in common 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:59.120
 I know I great planning because 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:06:02.050
 So a little intimidating at it a little Japan in the form because there is only English at the Minna 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.050
 It may be difficult but 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:11.750
 Even if you can do good English, this Elder Scrolls is true 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:15.520
 I think it's a lot of fun when you try playing It 's fun with friends , even with friends 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:17.520
 Although participating because to get into the same world in color 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.849
 I think it is easy to play 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:22.830
 As impression that we went 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:27.550
 I think it's amazing 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:30.760
 This is awesome in Japan at the sky rim 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.740
 What role-playing Well then this kind of is what it is said to Tan like a can not make 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.060
 but 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:37.110
 Yeah It is as it is already in this 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.750
 The world of rpg is 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:42.800
 I 'm going to go online 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:46.879
 Something is amazing 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:51.360
 Although it may be a beginner, it may not play by continuation. 

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:53.960
 Japanese version Neko This may not have been possible in Japanese 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:58.340
 No Yes is in pretty enters 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:07:03.910
 That 's why today is April 5 officially launched Elder Scrolls Online 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:04.889
 We stopped the preceding play with one and gave an impression 

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:07.590
 In that 

00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:11.510
 Well who to third please 

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:11.510
 Constitutional this time 

00:07:12.449 --> 00:07:16.230
 It is Elder Scrolls 

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:19.590
 Sounds good 

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:20.620
 It is such a time of use question and time of Kan Oburibion 

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:26.849
 2 

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:29.300
 Considerably but it is was not a good face this side also the feeling that power up 

00:07:26.849 --> 00:07:29.300
 Great
