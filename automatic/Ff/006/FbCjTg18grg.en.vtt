of journalists up a hill to sort of give

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.679 
of journalists up a hill to sort of give
them<00:00:20.710> some<00:00:20.890> idea<00:00:21.250> of<00:00:21.369> what<00:00:21.550> the<00:00:22.060> car<00:00:22.300> is<00:00:22.329> and

how it performs the car really is quite

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.659 
how it performs the car really is quite
amazing<00:00:25.930> for<00:00:26.649> the<00:00:26.680> fact<00:00:26.950> is<00:00:27.189> that<00:00:27.220> it<00:00:27.520> is

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:27.669 
amazing for the fact is that it is

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:31.319 
amazing for the fact is that it is
different<00:00:28.180> to<00:00:28.840> the<00:00:29.369> speed<00:00:30.369> and<00:00:30.640> but<00:00:31.000> you<00:00:31.149> need

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:31.329 
different to the speed and but you need

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:33.030 
different to the speed and but you need
to<00:00:31.480> drive<00:00:31.689> the<00:00:31.809> car<00:00:31.989> really<00:00:32.230> fast<00:00:32.320> to

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 
to drive the car really fast to

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.260 
to drive the car really fast to
understand<00:00:33.489> these<00:00:33.640> improvements<00:00:34.000> and

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
understand these improvements and

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.880 
understand these improvements and
therefore<00:00:34.570> it's<00:00:34.690> really<00:00:34.989> only<00:00:35.140> for<00:00:35.410> a<00:00:35.440> special

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
therefore it's really only for a special

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.250 
therefore it's really only for a special
sort<00:00:36.070> of<00:00:36.190> audience<00:00:36.550> so<00:00:37.450> for<00:00:37.720> us<00:00:37.840> as<00:00:37.990> far<00:00:38.170> as
