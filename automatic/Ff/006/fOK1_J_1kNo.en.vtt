development program one of the trips we

development program one of the trips we
do<00:02:30.160> on<00:02:30.490> the<00:02:30.610> program<00:02:31.090> is<00:02:31.330> a<00:02:31.360> trip<00:02:31.810> to<00:02:31.840> an

employment tribunal where students can

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.699 
employment tribunal where students can
actually<00:02:33.970> see<00:02:34.450> how<00:02:34.690> employment<00:02:35.260> law<00:02:35.380> works

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
actually see how employment law works

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.010 
actually see how employment law works
and<00:02:35.890> practice<00:02:36.280> which<00:02:37.239> it's<00:02:37.660> obviously

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
and practice which it's obviously

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.960 
and practice which it's obviously
difficult<00:02:38.260> to<00:02:38.530> teach<00:02:38.770> so<00:02:39.100> we<00:02:39.250> try<00:02:39.550> just<00:02:39.820> of

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
difficult to teach so we try just of

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.180 
difficult to teach so we try just of
combine<00:02:40.330> theory<00:02:40.720> and<00:02:41.080> practice<00:02:41.590> or<00:02:41.860> first<00:02:42.070> we

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
combine theory and practice or first we

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.970 
combine theory and practice or first we
teach<00:02:42.400> a<00:02:42.870> theory<00:02:43.870> of<00:02:44.140> employment<00:02:44.380> law<00:02:44.739> and

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
teach a theory of employment law and

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.620 
teach a theory of employment law and
then<00:02:45.100> we<00:02:45.220> go<00:02:45.340> to<00:02:45.400> an<00:02:45.550> employment<00:02:45.820> tribunal<00:02:46.180> to

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
then we go to an employment tribunal to

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.630 
then we go to an employment tribunal to
actually<00:02:46.900> show<00:02:47.080> how<00:02:47.560> it<00:02:47.709> works<00:02:47.920> in

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
actually show how it works in

vanishes I think one of a very exciting

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.340 
vanishes I think one of a very exciting
programs<00:03:03.940> in<00:03:04.030> London<00:03:04.330> has<00:03:04.450> obviously<00:03:04.900> many

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
programs in London has obviously many

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.080 
programs in London has obviously many
universities<00:03:06.010> but<00:03:06.280> Greenwich<00:03:06.670> has<00:03:06.820> a<00:03:06.850> very

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
universities but Greenwich has a very

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.550 
universities but Greenwich has a very
nice<00:03:07.180> combination<00:03:07.840> of<00:03:07.930> theory<00:03:08.380> and<00:03:08.410> practice

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
nice combination of theory and practice

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.070 
nice combination of theory and practice
which<00:03:09.160> I<00:03:09.280> think<00:03:09.549> are<00:03:10.060> the<00:03:10.209> universities<00:03:10.870> don't

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
which I think are the universities don't

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.530 
which I think are the universities don't
offer<00:03:11.320> so<00:03:11.890> our<00:03:11.950> students<00:03:12.640> actually<00:03:13.030> get<00:03:13.209> a<00:03:13.390> bit

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
offer so our students actually get a bit

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.420 
offer so our students actually get a bit
more<00:03:13.780> than<00:03:14.440> students<00:03:14.829> at<00:03:14.920> other<00:03:15.340> universities

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
more than students at other universities

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.479 
more than students at other universities
I<00:03:16.329> would<00:03:17.049> recommend<00:03:17.560> their<00:03:17.739> main<00:03:17.980> personal
