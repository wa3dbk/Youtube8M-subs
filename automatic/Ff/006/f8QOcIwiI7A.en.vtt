00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
track looks like the first part of the

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.799 
track looks like the first part of the
track<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:55.050> level<00:00:56.210> so<00:00:57.210> when<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.510> put<00:00:57.780> your

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
track is level so when you put your

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
train down it won't go anywhere until

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.690 
train down it won't go anywhere until
you're<00:01:01.199> ready<00:01:01.640> the<00:01:02.640> next<00:01:03.059> part<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.750> track

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:04.700

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
has two places where you can make it so

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.679 
has two places where you can make it so
the<00:01:09.630> train<00:01:10.020> can<00:01:10.439> go<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.650> different<00:01:10.979> way<00:01:11.479> one<00:01:12.479> on

the next part of the track has the two
separate<00:01:21.110> parts<00:01:21.500> merge<00:01:22.479> which<00:01:23.620> makes<00:01:24.620> for<00:01:24.890> a

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
separate parts merge which makes for a

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.630 
separate parts merge which makes for a
high<00:01:25.220> chance<00:01:25.729> of<00:01:25.940> accidents<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:27.830> next<00:01:28.370> part

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
high chance of accidents the next part

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.750 
high chance of accidents the next part
is<00:01:28.760> at<00:01:28.940> the<00:01:29.119> end<00:01:29.619> when<00:01:30.619> a<00:01:30.650> train<00:01:31.100> gets<00:01:31.490> here

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
is at the end when a train gets here

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.390 
is at the end when a train gets here

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.890 
first it bursts through the blue
barricade<00:01:35.119> and<00:01:35.420> that<00:01:36.200> means<00:01:36.590> it<00:01:36.860> won<00:01:37.630> now<00:01:38.630> that

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
barricade and that means it won now that

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.469 
barricade and that means it won now that
