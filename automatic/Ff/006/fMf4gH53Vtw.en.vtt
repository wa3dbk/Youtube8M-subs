these patients have been essentially
living<00:01:23.700> in<00:01:23.790> blackness<00:01:24.119> in<00:01:24.960> most<00:01:25.170> cases<00:01:25.380> for

many<00:01:25.860> many<00:01:26.070> years<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.610> so<00:01:27.479> what<00:01:27.900> this<00:01:28.020> is

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
many many years and so what this is

many many years and so what this is
doing<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:28.590> almost<00:01:28.890> if<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.250> could<00:01:29.400> imagine

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
doing is almost if you could imagine

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.039 
doing is almost if you could imagine
almost<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.650> pixelated<00:01:32.579> type<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.600> vision<00:01:33.900> where

almost a pixelated type of vision where

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.810 
almost a pixelated type of vision where
they<00:01:34.170> are<00:01:34.290> getting<00:01:34.560> stimulated<00:01:35.009> with<00:01:35.400> flashes

they are getting stimulated with flashes

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.580 
they are getting stimulated with flashes
of<00:01:35.970> light<00:01:36.180> when<00:01:36.900> they<00:01:36.990> perceive<00:01:37.350> something

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
of light when they perceive something

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.609 
of light when they perceive something
that's<00:01:37.860> bright<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.490> when<00:01:39.270> they<00:01:39.509> their<00:01:40.200> camera

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
that's bright and when they their camera

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.319 
that's bright and when they their camera
is<00:01:40.680> picking<00:01:40.829> up<00:01:41.070> something<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.759> darker

is picking up something that is darker

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.660 
is picking up something that is darker
then<00:01:42.600> then<00:01:43.049> they<00:01:43.290> get<00:01:43.470> less<00:01:43.799> flashes<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.460> light

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
then then they get less flashes of light

then then they get less flashes of light
the<00:01:45.390> patient<00:01:45.750> essentially<00:01:46.649> has<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.130> try<00:01:47.340> to

the patient essentially has to try to

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.550 
the patient essentially has to try to

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
mean and in many cases it can help them

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.840 
I think this represents a new generation
of<00:02:24.840> Medicine<00:02:25.290> where<00:02:25.500> rather<00:02:26.340> than<00:02:26.610> just

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
of Medicine where rather than just

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.050 
of Medicine where rather than just
treating<00:02:27.620> or<00:02:28.620> just<00:02:29.160> watching<00:02:29.580> as<00:02:29.670> patients

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
treating or just watching as patients

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.370 
treating or just watching as patients
lose<00:02:30.150> vision<00:02:30.480> or<00:02:30.780> trying<00:02:31.080> to<00:02:31.170> stabilize

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
lose vision or trying to stabilize

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.590 
lose vision or trying to stabilize
vision<00:02:32.040> for<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.640> first<00:02:32.880> time<00:02:33.150> we<00:02:33.420> can

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
vision for the first time we can

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.720 
vision for the first time we can
artificially<00:02:33.900> restore<00:02:34.620> vision<00:02:34.860> and<00:02:35.460> I<00:02:35.520> think

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
artificially restore vision and I think

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.370 
artificially restore vision and I think
this<00:02:35.880> opens<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.330> door<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:36.840> a<00:02:36.960> whole<00:02:37.020> new

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
this opens the door to a whole new

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.380 
this opens the door to a whole new
generation<00:02:37.440> for<00:02:38.040> era<00:02:38.190> of<00:02:38.400> medicine<00:02:38.820> which<00:02:39.300> is

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
generation for era of medicine which is

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.390 
generation for era of medicine which is
almost<00:02:39.540> like<00:02:39.780> science<00:02:39.930> fiction<00:02:40.370> recuperate<00:02:41.370> a
