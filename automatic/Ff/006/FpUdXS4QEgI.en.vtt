00:00:57.909 --> 00:00:59.189 
is right next the quick revive there
used<00:00:58.059> to<00:00:58.120> be<00:00:58.180> an<00:00:58.360> older<00:00:58.690> version<00:00:58.809> of<00:00:59.019> this<00:00:59.170> a

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199

used to be an older version of this a
few<00:00:59.440> months<00:00:59.589> ago<00:00:59.799> however<00:01:00.220> I<00:01:00.460> think<00:01:00.729> they

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
few months ago however I think they

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.430

barrier glitch and it makes all three

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.410 
barrier glitch and it makes all three
players<00:01:14.049> invincible<00:01:15.180> something<00:01:16.180> I<00:01:16.270> would

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
players invincible something I would

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.760 
players invincible something I would
like<00:01:16.600> to<00:01:16.690> just<00:01:16.840> point<00:01:17.020> out<00:01:17.260> is<00:01:17.409> the<00:01:17.500> fact<00:01:17.710> that

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
like to just point out is the fact that

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.469 
like to just point out is the fact that
zombies<00:01:18.159> can<00:01:18.310> sometimes<00:01:18.729> hit<00:01:18.940> you<00:01:19.090> when<00:01:19.450> you

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
zombies can sometimes hit you when you

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:20.999 
zombies can sometimes hit you when you
are<00:01:19.630> in<00:01:19.810> the<00:01:19.990> glitch<00:01:20.229> so<00:01:20.560> we<00:01:20.619> really<00:01:20.859> recommend

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
are in the glitch so we really recommend

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:22.800 
are in the glitch so we really recommend
having<00:01:21.430> juggernaut<00:01:21.969> just<00:01:22.210> to<00:01:22.270> be<00:01:22.390> on<00:01:22.479> the<00:01:22.570> safe

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
having juggernaut just to be on the safe

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.170 
having juggernaut just to be on the safe
side<00:01:22.920> also<00:01:23.920> I<00:01:23.950> really<00:01:24.310> recommend<00:01:24.820> keeping<00:01:24.969> the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
side also I really recommend keeping the

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.520 
side also I really recommend keeping the
number<00:01:25.479> of<00:01:25.570> zombies<00:01:25.689> in<00:01:26.020> front<00:01:26.200> of<00:01:26.320> you<00:01:26.409> to<00:01:26.500> a

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
number of zombies in front of you to a

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.319 
number of zombies in front of you to a
minimum<00:01:26.950> because<00:01:27.520> sometimes<00:01:27.969> if<00:01:28.210> you<00:01:28.299> have

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329 
minimum because sometimes if you have

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:30.539 
minimum because sometimes if you have
more<00:01:28.719> than<00:01:28.960> five<00:01:29.200> to<00:01:29.350> ten<00:01:29.530> zombies<00:01:29.920> they<00:01:30.340> will

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
more than five to ten zombies they will

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.300 
more than five to ten zombies they will
just<00:01:30.759> surround<00:01:31.030> you<00:01:31.210> and<00:01:31.240> down<00:01:31.570> you<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.950> final

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
just surround you and down you the final

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.590 
just surround you and down you the final
barrier<00:01:33.640> glitch<00:01:33.759> which<00:01:34.060> I'm<00:01:34.210> going<00:01:34.420> to<00:01:34.509> be
