00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.860
 at the end of the year from this starting table 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.709
 rocket will take off alliance 2 first in history 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.570
 new spaceport main design 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:16.030
 pad start ring 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.320
 established 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.000
 specialists left to fix the elements 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.640
 who withheld missiles before launch 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.429
 carry out installation work and start 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.160
 the table is ready oriental can be safely 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:30.550
 call the spaceport is no longer building 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.620
 this is technology this is all this 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.480
 rocket assembly is the basis here 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.220
 from where it will start and here on 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.720
 this ring, it will hang hold 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.890
 if before we only saw 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.600
 construction readiness 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.250
 or unavailability or course of construction 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.590
 works now when we set about 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.090
 installation of the cabin maintenance we are already seeing 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.560
 what 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:53.330
 the appearance of this launcher gain 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:54.980
 exactly space mobile tower 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.950
 maintenance same design 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.800
 Works and order matron trigger however 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.870
 the tower is not twin Guiana created 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.479
 especially for the tropics here on 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.060
 male family where half the snow and frost 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.450
 under 40 the tower was designed for local 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.320
 climate once booster 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.780
 set on the starting table 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.390
 will drive up a mobile service tower and 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.190
 will close the rocket ie preparation for 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.580
 start will be held in a closed 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.950
 room for people yes and for rocket it 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.980
 comfort and weather protection 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.230
 due to its size due to color 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.630
 scales which will be this unit will be 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:35.030
 face launch complex 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.610
 outwardly this beauty looks like a set 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.850
 metal up really it is very 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.860
 highly intellectual 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.200
 fully completed system she 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.430
 punctuated with electronics 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.490
 automation means of protection on it 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.400
 all end sensors it works from 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.400
 the moment of arrival of the carrier is practically 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.340
 I give a piece in such mazes get confused 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:01.909
 easy this is also a launch complex but already 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.860
 16 meters down dozens of rooms from here 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.740
 to the rocket carrier will be fed 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.750
 hot we are indoors in it 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.280
 at the opening where the main are located 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.410
 gas filling stations 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.750
 indications for refueling the carrier rocket and 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.819
 gas supply boosters rocket 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.360
 is here now 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.780
 by wall 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:24.170
 established starting position here from here 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.580
 produced by her dressing measles it all 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.340
 equipment will work in full 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.440
 power providing the first run 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.590
 rocket union samara land 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.450
 carrier rocket union inside head 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.610
 fairing nobody really not that 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.310
 and many but precisely here and place 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.410
 the spacecraft first is ordinary 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.209
 metal construction is already here shop 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.470
 action staples progress begins the most 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.380
 important main stage 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.360
 work with the product sheathe insulation 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.090
 install the necessary systems 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.900
 sensors in general leads the proper appearance and 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.900
 working condition 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.580
 Samara rocket on the space center 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:04.370
 progress rocket called cars it 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.890
 the hardest technical device inside 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.430
 huge amount to run sensors and 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.250
 systems 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.550
 even minor changes require 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.100
 new calculations and tests of this union 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.890
 the designer came up with a special parade 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.110
 water modification for the spaceport 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.510
 East or Bryansk space 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.840
 center when the rocket is prepared under 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.870
 mobile service tower needed 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.190
 remove oxygen vapor beyond 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.019
 Mobile borscht that was not 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.480
 high content of fire hazard 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.790
 the atmosphere that is here under these covers 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.200
 we have drainage and drainage 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.750
 tank safety valve 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.330
 oxidants that we have below and 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.070
 for modification of preparing for towers 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.510
 as I said here are joined 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:53.280
 special device patented 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.670
 by the way us in order to infer how 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.790
 would 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:04:01.550
 oxygen vapor beyond the mobile 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:03.959
 tower preliminary intermediate 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.750
 today there are three main 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:10.470
 Union modifications are even easy 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:13.230
 launch vehicle union 21 in serial 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:16.410
 production of each machine individually 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.109
 Eastern Cosmodrome is a step forward union 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:22.680
 21 a with a new onboard computing 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:25.520
 this car will be the machine 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.010
 machine that does not require 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:32.030
 battery charge 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:35.580
 lightweight cable networks that is it 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.650
 a step forward compared to those machines 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.510
 which today fly from the spaceport 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:43.680
 Plesetsk Baikonur 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:46.500
 and the ghanaian space center is now in 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.840
 progress shops several missiles are collected 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.560
 their blocks will also be taken to the spaceport 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:55.919
 here manned for baikonur union-2 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.900
 for kuro and east at sea but 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.940
 spaceport on schedule rocket goes to 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.690
 July of this year this term without 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.250
 doubts will be fulfilled 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.410
 open new space pages 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:09.020
 history rocket master from Samara 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:11.960
 accounted for earlier with Gagarin rocket 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.640
 who was born on the Volga land 12 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.550
 april began manned 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:18.680
 cosmonautics 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:21.470
 1840 rocket launch companies allied for 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.990
 half a century no one has such a record 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:28.390
 today alliance flies from 3 spaceports 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.390
 world eastern will be the fourth
