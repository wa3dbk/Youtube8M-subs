00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
right onto his wrist and you see how

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.849 
right onto his wrist and you see how
that<00:01:30.060> affects<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:32.899> if<00:01:33.899> the<00:01:34.079> attackers<00:01:34.560> land<00:01:34.770> at

once I've contacted him with the blade I

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:47.130 
once I've contacted him with the blade I
can<00:01:41.039> just<00:01:41.479> drag<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.959> upward<00:01:44.090> or

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.490 

I<00:01:47.200> can<00:01:48.159> continue<00:01:48.760> just<00:01:49.210> to<00:01:49.330> manipulate<00:01:50.260> and

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
I can continue just to manipulate and

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.340 
I can continue just to manipulate and
cut<00:01:50.890> his<00:01:51.850> arm<00:01:52.180> until<00:01:52.510> he<00:01:52.630> decides<00:01:52.930> he<00:01:53.110> really

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
cut his arm until he decides he really

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.560 
cut his arm until he decides he really
wants<00:01:53.620> to<00:01:53.650> let<00:01:53.890> go

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570

another<00:01:55.570> option<00:01:56.050> is<00:01:58.170> poking<00:01:59.170> the<00:01:59.470> blade<00:01:59.770> in

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
another option is poking the blade in

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
another option is poking the blade in
along<00:02:00.880> this<00:02:01.270> farm<00:02:01.750> and<00:02:02.050> just<00:02:02.229> drag<00:02:02.680> it<00:02:03.520> up<00:02:03.670> and

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
along this farm and just drag it up and

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.990 
along this farm and just drag it up and
then<00:02:04.810> again<00:02:05.470> until<00:02:05.770> he<00:02:05.920> really<00:02:06.130> decides<00:02:06.460> he's

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
then again until he really decides he's

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:17.580 
then again until he really decides he's
had<00:02:07.180> more<00:02:07.360> than<00:02:07.479> enough<00:02:16.050> now<00:02:17.050> how<00:02:17.230> might<00:02:17.440> you
