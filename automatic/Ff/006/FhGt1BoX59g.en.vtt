on no maps like all father Gardens way

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.730 
on no maps like all father Gardens way
station<00:01:58.590> only<00:01:59.220> maps<00:01:59.640> like<00:02:00.030> security<00:02:00.840> ruins

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
river pavilion jacinto those kind of

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.750 
river pavilion jacinto those kind of
maps<00:02:09.649> I'm<00:02:10.649> not<00:02:10.830> sure<00:02:10.890> if<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.310> works<00:02:11.520> with<00:02:11.640> the

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
maps I'm not sure if it works with the

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.040 
maps I'm not sure if it works with the
flashback<00:02:12.330> maps<00:02:12.830> my<00:02:13.830> guess<00:02:14.100> is<00:02:14.340> it's<00:02:14.370> it

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
flashback maps my guess is it's it

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.350 
flashback maps my guess is it's it
probably<00:02:16.050> does<00:02:16.410> because<00:02:17.400> they<00:02:17.820> didn't<00:02:18.150> update

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
probably does because they didn't update

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.180 
probably does because they didn't update
it<00:02:19.610> before<00:02:20.610> they<00:02:20.970> came<00:02:21.270> out<00:02:21.480> so<00:02:22.050> my<00:02:22.950> guess<00:02:23.010> is

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
it before they came out so my guess is

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:44.380 
it before they came out so my guess is
that<00:02:23.400> they<00:02:23.670> do

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:54.199 

so<00:02:45.050> I<00:02:45.080> takes<00:02:45.500> a<00:02:45.620> while<00:02:45.770> to<00:02:45.920> load

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.059 

okay<00:02:55.209> once<00:02:55.569> you<00:02:55.810> started<00:02:56.290> your<00:02:56.530> gonna<00:02:56.739> just

okay once you started your gonna just

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.690 
okay once you started your gonna just
throw<00:02:57.280> your<00:02:57.609> smoke<00:02:59.129> have<00:03:00.129> it<00:03:00.249> knocks<00:03:00.459> you<00:03:00.579> down

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
throw your smoke have it knocks you down

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.849 
throw your smoke have it knocks you down
that's<00:03:01.239> good<00:03:01.510> just<00:03:02.109> return<00:03:02.469> to<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.650> lobby
