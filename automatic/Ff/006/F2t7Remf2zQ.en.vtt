00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
fabrics are made from natural things

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.180 
fabrics are made from natural things
either<00:00:46.300> from<00:00:47.300> plants<00:00:47.870> or<00:00:48.200> from<00:00:48.620> animals

either from plants or from animals

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.630 
either from plants or from animals
whereas<00:00:49.850> synthetic<00:00:50.480> fibers<00:00:50.930> those<00:00:51.350> are

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
whereas synthetic fibers those are

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.430 
whereas synthetic fibers those are
chemically<00:00:52.640> processed<00:00:53.210> or<00:00:53.480> manufactured

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
fibers and they found whichever one you

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.910 
fibers and they found whichever one you
choose<00:00:58.610> to<00:00:59.120> use<00:00:59.329> for<00:00:59.630> your<00:00:59.719> for<00:01:00.200> your<00:01:00.230> garment

choose to use for your for your garment
it's<00:01:01.430> going<00:01:01.760> to<00:01:01.969> make<00:01:02.149> a<00:01:02.180> difference<00:01:02.780> on<00:01:02.899> how

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
it's going to make a difference on how

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.160 
it's going to make a difference on how
the<00:01:03.829> fabric<00:01:04.430> feels<00:01:04.820> and<00:01:05.210> how<00:01:05.449> it<00:01:05.600> looks<00:01:05.960> and

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
the fabric feels and how it looks and

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.090 
the fabric feels and how it looks and
how<00:01:06.410> it<00:01:06.740> flows<00:01:07.610> okay<00:01:08.030> so<00:01:08.720> let's<00:01:09.590> start<00:01:09.890> with

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
how it flows okay so let's start with

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.749 
how it flows okay so let's start with
our<00:01:10.160> natural<00:01:10.789> fibers<00:01:11.740> one<00:01:12.740> of<00:01:12.950> the<00:01:13.100> basic

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
our natural fibers one of the basic

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:16.210 
our natural fibers one of the basic
natural<00:01:13.940> fibers<00:01:14.600> made<00:01:14.930> out<00:01:15.140> of<00:01:15.350> plant

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
natural fibers made out of plant

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.390 
natural fibers made out of plant
material<00:01:16.790> is<00:01:16.970> linen<00:01:17.960> linen<00:01:18.560> is<00:01:18.920> made<00:01:19.220> out<00:01:19.369> of

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
material is linen linen is made out of

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.560 
material is linen linen is made out of
flax<00:01:20.360> and<00:01:21.010> how<00:01:22.010> you<00:01:22.070> can<00:01:22.400> tell<00:01:22.670> that<00:01:22.700> it's<00:01:23.390> a

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
flax and how you can tell that it's a

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.770 
flax and how you can tell that it's a
natural<00:01:23.810> fiber<00:01:24.440> is<00:01:24.860> that<00:01:25.490> it<00:01:25.729> creases<00:01:26.360> really

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
natural fiber is that it creases really

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.170 
natural fiber is that it creases really
easily<00:01:27.200> so<00:01:27.740> you<00:01:27.770> know<00:01:27.979> how<00:01:28.159> we<00:01:28.610> always<00:01:28.850> say

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
easily so you know how we always say

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.109 
easily so you know how we always say
that<00:01:29.390> linen<00:01:29.810> gets<00:01:30.110> very<00:01:30.860> wrinkled<00:01:31.490> well

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
that linen gets very wrinkled well

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:33.880 
that linen gets very wrinkled well
that's<00:01:32.360> because<00:01:32.540> the<00:01:32.810> natural<00:01:33.200> fibers<00:01:33.650> tend

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
that's because the natural fibers tend

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.580 
that's because the natural fibers tend
to<00:01:34.100> crease<00:01:34.430> very<00:01:34.790> easily<00:01:35.150> so<00:01:36.140> one<00:01:36.380> of<00:01:36.409> the

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
to crease very easily so one of the

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.300 
to crease very easily so one of the
things<00:01:36.860> about<00:01:37.130> natural<00:01:37.700> fibers<00:01:38.180> is<00:01:38.570> that

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
things about natural fibers is that

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.429 
things about natural fibers is that
metro<00:01:40.310> plant<00:01:40.580> fibers<00:01:41.060> is<00:01:41.600> that<00:01:41.930> they're

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
metro plant fibers is that they're

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.429 
metro plant fibers is that they're
they're<00:01:42.740> very<00:01:42.979> cool<00:01:43.340> to<00:01:43.670> the<00:01:43.759> touch<00:01:44.439> they

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
they're very cool to the touch they

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.660 
they're very cool to the touch they
could<00:01:45.650> be<00:01:45.830> either<00:01:46.070> force<00:01:46.869> like<00:01:47.869> a<00:01:47.900> linen<00:01:48.619> is<00:01:49.070> or

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
could be either force like a linen is or

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:56.109 
could be either force like a linen is or
very<00:01:50.180> very<00:01:50.930> smooth<00:01:51.939> like<00:01:52.939> silk<00:01:55.119> natural

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
very very smooth like silk natural

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.080 
very very smooth like silk natural
fibers<00:01:56.600> can<00:01:57.530> be<00:01:57.560> made<00:01:58.130> either<00:01:58.400> from<00:01:58.700> like<00:01:58.970> I

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
fibers can be made either from like I

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.990 
fibers can be made either from like I
said<00:01:59.329> animal<00:01:59.869> or<00:02:00.650> they<00:02:00.890> could<00:02:01.040> be<00:02:01.189> from<00:02:01.549> a

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
said animal or they could be from a

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.100 
said animal or they could be from a
plant<00:02:02.450> fab<00:02:02.720> pair<00:02:03.350> of<00:02:03.640> fibers<00:02:04.659> this<00:02:05.659> is<00:02:05.840> cotton

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
plant fab pair of fibers this is cotton

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.249 
plant fab pair of fibers this is cotton
and<00:02:06.439> as<00:02:07.189> you<00:02:07.340> can<00:02:07.490> tell<00:02:07.759> with<00:02:07.970> the<00:02:08.090> cotton<00:02:08.600> it's

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
and as you can tell with the cotton it's

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.319 
and as you can tell with the cotton it's
um<00:02:09.590> it's<00:02:09.979> very<00:02:10.100> it<00:02:10.729> has<00:02:10.759> a<00:02:11.090> very<00:02:11.690> smooth<00:02:12.170> touch

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.329 
um it's very it has a very smooth touch

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:17.979 
um it's very it has a very smooth touch
it<00:02:14.440> takes<00:02:15.440> color<00:02:15.769> very<00:02:16.340> easily<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:17.630> colors

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
it takes color very easily the colors

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.060 
it takes color very easily the colors
are<00:02:18.140> very<00:02:18.290> bright<00:02:18.440> and<00:02:19.690> it's<00:02:20.690> very<00:02:21.260> absorbent

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
are very bright and it's very absorbent

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.030 
are very bright and it's very absorbent
so<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.430> material<00:02:22.970> feels<00:02:23.269> very

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
so the material feels very

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.190 
so the material feels very
soft<00:02:24.430> and<00:02:25.060> absorbent<00:02:26.280> another<00:02:27.280> thing<00:02:27.580> about

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
soft and absorbent another thing about

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.890 
soft and absorbent another thing about
natural<00:02:29.200> fibers<00:02:29.980> is<00:02:30.250> that<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.790> animal<00:02:31.360> fibers

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
natural fibers is that the animal fibers

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.069 
natural fibers is that the animal fibers
things<00:02:32.530> like<00:02:32.829> from<00:02:33.040> silk<00:02:33.569> while<00:02:34.569> they're<00:02:34.810> cool

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:35.079 
things like from silk while they're cool

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:37.080 
things like from silk while they're cool
to<00:02:35.319> the<00:02:35.439> touch<00:02:35.680> and<00:02:35.709> they're<00:02:36.010> also<00:02:36.220> absorbent

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
to the touch and they're also absorbent

to the touch and they're also absorbent
but<00:02:37.510> they<00:02:37.659> don't<00:02:37.870> tend<00:02:38.079> to<00:02:38.170> crease<00:02:38.620> as<00:02:38.860> much<00:02:39.400> as

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
but they don't tend to crease as much as

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.699 
but they don't tend to crease as much as
plant<00:02:42.099> fibers<00:02:42.640> so<00:02:43.180> you'll<00:02:43.569> notice<00:02:43.989> that<00:02:44.200> I<00:02:44.260> can

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
plant fibers so you'll notice that I can

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.009 
plant fibers so you'll notice that I can
just<00:02:45.280> kind<00:02:45.340> of<00:02:45.610> hint<00:02:45.819> try<00:02:46.090> to<00:02:46.150> hand<00:02:46.599> crease

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
just kind of hint try to hand crease

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.180 
just kind of hint try to hand crease
this<00:02:47.709> and<00:02:48.040> it<00:02:48.459> hardly<00:02:49.560> creates<00:02:50.560> much<00:02:50.890> of<00:02:51.099> a

this and it hardly creates much of a
crease<00:02:51.519> whereas<00:02:52.359> if<00:02:52.540> I<00:02:52.690> chose<00:02:53.170> a<00:02:53.849> plant<00:02:54.849> fiber

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180

and I try to hand crease look at how

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.280 
and I try to hand crease look at how
much<00:02:58.450> more<00:02:58.870> the<00:02:59.620> the<00:03:00.310> fabric<00:03:01.299> tends<00:03:01.750> to<00:03:01.989> crease

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
much more the the fabric tends to crease

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.229 
much more the the fabric tends to crease

another type of synthetic fiber that you

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.500 
another type of synthetic fiber that you
wear<00:04:55.270> the<00:04:55.600> fiber<00:04:55.840> is<00:04:56.169> a<00:04:56.200> much<00:04:56.560> smaller<00:04:57.039> you<00:04:57.910> can

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
wear the fiber is a much smaller you can

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.719 
wear the fiber is a much smaller you can
basically<00:04:58.870> replicate<00:04:59.770> the<00:04:59.949> look<00:05:00.160> of<00:05:00.340> silk

basically replicate the look of silk
using<00:05:01.240> synthetic<00:05:01.479> fibers<00:05:02.289> and<00:05:02.500> as<00:05:02.650> you<00:05:02.770> can

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:02.889 
using synthetic fibers and as you can

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:05.640 
using synthetic fibers and as you can
see<00:05:02.949> the<00:05:03.669> fibers<00:05:04.120> are<00:05:04.300> much<00:05:04.600> much<00:05:05.080> smaller

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
see the fibers are much much smaller

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.700 
see the fibers are much much smaller
then<00:05:06.580> you<00:05:07.000> would<00:05:07.479> find<00:05:07.750> with<00:05:07.930> the<00:05:08.110> natural

then you would find with the natural

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.860 
then you would find with the natural
fibers<00:05:09.100> because<00:05:09.370> the<00:05:09.520> natural<00:05:09.880> fibers<00:05:10.240> tend

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
fibers because the natural fibers tend

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.379 
fibers because the natural fibers tend
to<00:05:11.080> have<00:05:11.620> air<00:05:11.889> pockets<00:05:12.280> in<00:05:12.760> the<00:05:13.030> fight<00:05:13.240> between

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:13.389 
to have air pockets in the fight between

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:15.629 
to have air pockets in the fight between
the<00:05:13.630> fibers<00:05:14.229> themselves<00:05:14.800> and<00:05:14.950> that<00:05:15.340> gives<00:05:15.580> it

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:15.639 
the fibers themselves and that gives it

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:19.110 
the fibers themselves and that gives it
a<00:05:15.760> lot<00:05:15.940> of<00:05:16.090> loft<00:05:16.479> a<00:05:16.870> lot<00:05:17.380> of<00:05:17.550> ability<00:05:18.550> to<00:05:18.580> absorb

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
a lot of loft a lot of ability to absorb

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.930 
a lot of loft a lot of ability to absorb
it<00:05:19.360> that's<00:05:19.510> why<00:05:19.660> it's<00:05:19.810> so<00:05:19.960> absorbent<00:05:20.710> and<00:05:21.610> so

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
it that's why it's so absorbent and so

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.659 
it that's why it's so absorbent and so
that<00:05:22.150> synthetic<00:05:22.630> fibers<00:05:23.430> always<00:05:24.430> will<00:05:24.639> have

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:24.669 
that synthetic fibers always will have

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:27.150 
that synthetic fibers always will have
like<00:05:25.270> even<00:05:25.599> though<00:05:25.780> as<00:05:26.080> much<00:05:26.620> as<00:05:26.770> they<00:05:26.919> try<00:05:27.130> to

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
like even though as much as they try to

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.940 
like even though as much as they try to
make<00:05:27.430> them<00:05:27.610> feel<00:05:28.240> soft<00:05:28.780> they'll<00:05:29.380> always<00:05:29.620> have

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:29.950 
make them feel soft they'll always have

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.750 
make them feel soft they'll always have
a<00:05:30.419> plasticky<00:05:31.419> feel<00:05:31.450> to<00:05:32.080> them<00:05:32.320> and<00:05:32.590> and<00:05:33.520> that's

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760 
a plasticky feel to them and and that's

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.270 
a plasticky feel to them and and that's
how<00:05:33.970> you<00:05:34.030> can<00:05:34.270> tell<00:05:34.510> between<00:05:34.770> natural<00:05:35.770> fibers

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
how you can tell between natural fibers
