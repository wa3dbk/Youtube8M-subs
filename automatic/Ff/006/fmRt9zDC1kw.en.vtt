water bladder anyway just to show you
how<00:00:25.230> it<00:00:25.320> works<00:00:25.350> we're<00:00:26.039> going<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.189> do<00:00:26.310> is<00:00:26.519> I've

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
how it works we're going to do is I've

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.250 
how it works we're going to do is I've
got<00:00:27.150> this<00:00:27.240> little<00:00:27.390> torch<00:00:27.689> here<00:00:27.960> you<00:00:28.109> can

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
got this little torch here you can

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.640 
got this little torch here you can
ignore<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.680> but<00:00:28.830> it's<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.130> it's<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.460> snowy<00:00:29.730> day

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
ignore it but it's a it's a snowy day

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.209 
ignore it but it's a it's a snowy day
facing<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.610> West<00:00:32.910> here<00:00:33.860> but<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:34.890> need<00:00:35.070> the

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
facing the the West here but I need the

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.690 
facing the the West here but I need the
snowy<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.880> need<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.570> torch<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.110> prevent<00:00:37.700> the

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
snowy I need the torch to prevent the

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.380 
snowy I need the torch to prevent the
water<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.840> I'm<00:00:39.960> about<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.230> place<00:00:40.500> from<00:00:41.390> from

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
water that I'm about to place from from

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.000 
water that I'm about to place from from
ice<00:00:42.629> boxing<00:00:43.290> so<00:00:43.969> what<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:45.090> see<00:00:45.270> here<00:00:45.539> is<00:00:46.010> the

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
ice boxing so what you see here is the

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.549 
ice boxing so what you see here is the
main<00:00:47.280> source<00:00:47.550> for<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.210> water<00:00:48.390> ladder<00:00:48.629> the

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
main source for the water ladder the

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.770 
main source for the water ladder the
important<00:00:49.950> tweak<00:00:50.789> here<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.570> you've<00:00:51.750> got

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
important tweak here is that you've got

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.990 
important tweak here is that you've got
the<00:00:51.960> water<00:00:52.110> source<00:00:52.379> here<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:53.280> flows<00:00:53.670> into

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
the water source here and it flows into

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.549 
the water source here and it flows into
an<00:00:54.180> empty<00:00:54.329> block<00:00:54.570> next<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.289> want<00:00:55.500> to

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
an empty block next to it so you want to

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.490 
an empty block next to it so you want to
have<00:00:55.649> moving<00:00:55.980> water<00:00:56.250> going<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.730> way<00:00:57.469> the<00:00:58.469> the

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
have moving water going that way the the

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.689 
have moving water going that way the the
trick<00:00:59.070> or<00:00:59.219> concept<00:00:59.760> here<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:01.699> basically

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
trick or concept here is that basically

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.350 
trick or concept here is that basically
in<00:01:03.539> this<00:01:03.780> little<00:01:04.049> hole<00:01:04.199> right<00:01:04.229> here<00:01:05.150> you<00:01:06.150> can

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
in this little hole right here you can

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.219 
in this little hole right here you can
actually<00:01:06.630> do<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.140> water<00:01:07.439> ladder<00:01:07.799> climb<00:01:09.229> turbo

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
actually do a water ladder climb turbo

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.810 
actually do a water ladder climb turbo
one<00:01:10.500> or<00:01:10.619> ladder<00:01:10.740> climb<00:01:11.070> by<00:01:11.340> just<00:01:11.670> pressing

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
one or ladder climb by just pressing

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.060 
one or ladder climb by just pressing
into<00:01:12.150> this<00:01:12.270> corner<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:13.200> if<00:01:13.290> i<00:01:13.350> just<00:01:13.530> press<00:01:13.799> into

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
into this corner so if i just press into

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.810 
into this corner so if i just press into
this<00:01:14.159> corner<00:01:14.430> i<00:01:14.670> shoot<00:01:15.000> right<00:01:15.240> up<00:01:15.950> and<00:01:16.950> that

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
this corner i shoot right up and that

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.310 
this corner i shoot right up and that
concept<00:01:18.420> we're<00:01:18.600> going<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.780> build<00:01:19.020> into<00:01:19.290> a

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
concept we're going to build into a

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.140 
concept we're going to build into a
ladder<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.890> goes<00:01:19.920> all<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.340> way<00:01:20.580> down<00:01:20.610> into

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
ladder that goes all the way down into

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.700 
ladder that goes all the way down into
the<00:01:21.270> ground<00:01:21.619> using<00:01:22.619> sky<00:01:23.580> bikes<00:01:23.820> tricks<00:01:24.710> so

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
the ground using sky bikes tricks so

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.740 
the ground using sky bikes tricks so
what<00:01:26.310> we're<00:01:26.430> going<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.610> do<00:01:26.700> here<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:27.119> I'm<00:01:27.630> going

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
what we're going to do here is I'm going

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.450 
what we're going to do here is I'm going
to<00:01:27.840> dig<00:01:28.140> out<00:01:28.909> some<00:01:29.909> sections<00:01:30.450> around<00:01:30.720> here<00:01:31.500> go

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
to dig out some sections around here go

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.460 
to dig out some sections around here go
down<00:01:32.670> about<00:01:33.090> three<00:01:33.540> levels<00:01:34.820> just<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:36.030> show<00:01:36.479> the

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
down about three levels just to show the

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.350 
down about three levels just to show the
depth<00:01:37.770> here

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.150 

alright<00:01:42.080> so<00:01:42.380> I'm<00:01:42.560> down<00:01:42.740> about<00:01:42.980> three<00:01:43.310> levels

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
alright so I'm down about three levels

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.200 
alright so I'm down about three levels
well<00:01:46.160> let's<00:01:46.430> go<00:01:46.520> down<00:01:46.640> one<00:01:46.760> more<00:01:46.880> what's<00:01:47.060> good

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
well let's go down one more what's good

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.700 
well let's go down one more what's good
enough<00:01:47.330> for<00:01:47.540> thought

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.280

alright so what we want to do here is I
want<00:01:53.440> to<00:01:53.500> cut<00:01:53.740> a<00:01:53.770> hole<00:01:54.040> in<00:01:54.369> this<00:01:55.090> dirt<00:01:55.479> this<00:01:55.780> is

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
want to cut a hole in this dirt this is

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.500 
want to cut a hole in this dirt this is
basically<00:01:56.950> even<00:01:57.549> with<00:01:57.760> the<00:01:57.940> water<00:01:58.180> which<00:01:58.479> is

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
basically even with the water which is

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.510 
basically even with the water which is
right<00:01:58.840> there<00:01:59.140> so<00:01:59.409> what<00:02:00.040> I'm<00:02:00.130> doing<00:02:00.159> is<00:02:00.460> I'm

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
cutting away a level there I'm going to

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.789 
cutting away a level there I'm going to
basically<00:02:04.060> make<00:02:04.450> a<00:02:04.479> run<00:02:04.900> in<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:05.229> ladder<00:02:05.440> kind

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
basically make a run in the ladder kind

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:07.560 
basically make a run in the ladder kind
of<00:02:05.860> like<00:02:05.950> the<00:02:06.070> top<00:02:06.280> source<00:02:06.729> of<00:02:06.880> water<00:02:07.090> we<00:02:07.390> got

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
of like the top source of water we got

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.710 
of like the top source of water we got

this<00:02:17.650> usually<00:02:18.160> is<00:02:18.250> actually<00:02:18.640> to<00:02:18.819> replace<00:02:19.630> this

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
this usually is actually to replace this

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.650 
this usually is actually to replace this
side<00:02:20.230> here<00:02:21.720> and<00:02:22.720> then<00:02:23.650> go<00:02:23.860> back<00:02:24.010> up<00:02:24.489> one

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
side here and then go back up one

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.860 
side here and then go back up one
level<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:27.900> take<00:02:28.900> a<00:02:28.930> hole<00:02:29.260> out<00:02:29.290> of<00:02:29.560> here<00:02:29.950> and

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
level and take a hole out of here and

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.720 
level and take a hole out of here and
now<00:02:31.870> now<00:02:32.320> that<00:02:32.530> I've<00:02:32.620> carved<00:02:33.190> out<00:02:33.340> that<00:02:33.520> part

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
now now that I've carved out that part

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:34.950 
now now that I've carved out that part
I'll<00:02:33.790> just<00:02:33.940> knock<00:02:34.120> out<00:02:34.270> this<00:02:34.390> hole<00:02:34.570> and<00:02:34.720> water

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
I'll just knock out this hole and water

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.160 
I'll just knock out this hole and water
will<00:02:35.110> pour<00:02:35.380> down<00:02:35.790> into<00:02:36.790> that<00:02:37.060> into<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:37.810> rung

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
will pour down into that into the rung

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.110 
will pour down into that into the rung
of<00:02:38.350> the<00:02:38.380> ladder<00:02:38.490> so<00:02:39.490> what<00:02:39.640> you<00:02:39.760> can<00:02:39.880> see<00:02:40.090> here

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
of the ladder so what you can see here

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
of the ladder so what you can see here
is<00:02:40.420> if<00:02:40.540> I<00:02:40.690> press<00:02:41.110> up<00:02:41.320> I<00:02:42.720> come<00:02:43.720> up<00:02:43.810> to<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:44.020> top

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
is if I press up I come up to the top

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.920 
is if I press up I come up to the top
just<00:02:44.380> fine<00:02:44.650> so<00:02:45.220> we've<00:02:46.090> already<00:02:46.240> started<00:02:46.480> that

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
just fine so we've already started that

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.150 
just fine so we've already started that
part<00:02:47.350> of<00:02:47.440> the<00:02:47.500> ladder<00:02:47.620> will<00:02:47.860> show<00:02:47.980> you<00:02:48.070> another

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
part of the ladder will show you another

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.670 
part of the ladder will show you another
run<00:02:48.640> while<00:02:49.060> we're<00:02:49.270> here<00:02:51.600> go<00:02:52.600> down<00:02:52.900> another

run while we're here go down another

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.930 
run while we're here go down another
level

and<00:03:13.920> dig<00:03:14.520> out<00:03:14.670> that<00:03:14.700> hole<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:15.330> you'll<00:03:15.480> see<00:03:15.600> the

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
and dig out that hole and you'll see the

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.000 
and dig out that hole and you'll see the
water<00:03:15.870> come<00:03:16.110> down<00:03:16.320> and<00:03:16.560> it<00:03:16.620> goes<00:03:16.740> into<00:03:16.980> that

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
water come down and it goes into that

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.500 
water come down and it goes into that
run<00:03:17.370> and<00:03:17.640> then<00:03:17.760> now<00:03:17.910> if<00:03:18.000> I<00:03:18.060> come<00:03:18.210> over<00:03:18.270> here

the top and I'll show you one more run

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.790 
the top and I'll show you one more run
just<00:03:23.610> be<00:03:24.030> sure<00:03:24.060> you<00:03:24.360> got<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:24.570> concept<00:03:25.050> you<00:03:25.650> can

just be sure you got the concept you can
also<00:03:27.110> put<00:03:28.110> a<00:03:28.140> ladder<00:03:28.440> I<00:03:28.620> put<00:03:28.920> a<00:03:28.980> ladder<00:03:29.100> right

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
also put a ladder I put a ladder right

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.310 
also put a ladder I put a ladder right
here<00:03:29.700> so<00:03:29.940> that<00:03:30.150> it's<00:03:30.420> easier<00:03:30.870> when<00:03:31.020> I<00:03:31.080> fall

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
here so that it's easier when I fall

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.920 
here so that it's easier when I fall
down<00:03:31.350> to<00:03:31.860> be<00:03:31.980> sure<00:03:32.250> that<00:03:32.280> that<00:03:33.060> I<00:03:33.210> coast<00:03:33.630> to<00:03:33.900> a

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
down to be sure that that I coast to a

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.260 
down to be sure that that I coast to a
stop<00:03:34.020> without<00:03:34.590> dying<00:03:34.980> I<00:03:35.250> don't<00:03:36.060> want<00:03:36.210> another

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
stop without dying I don't want another

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:40.420 
stop without dying I don't want another
video<00:03:36.750> of<00:03:36.900> me<00:03:37.050> dying<00:03:37.350> up<00:03:38.190> on<00:03:38.520> the<00:03:38.760> internet<00:03:39.260> and

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
video of me dying up on the internet and

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.380 
video of me dying up on the internet and
I'll<00:03:41.430> take<00:03:41.700> two<00:03:42.030> down<00:03:42.240> two<00:03:42.630> levels

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.010 

then<00:03:46.319> I'll<00:03:46.440> poke<00:03:46.770> a<00:03:46.800> hole<00:03:46.920> here<00:03:47.670> I<00:03:47.940> used<00:03:48.750> to<00:03:48.840> put

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
then I'll poke a hole here I used to put

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.520 
then I'll poke a hole here I used to put
whole<00:03:49.290> their<00:03:49.560> first<00:03:50.010> dig<00:03:51.000> out<00:03:51.209> the<00:03:52.080> bottom

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
whole their first dig out the bottom

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.880 
whole their first dig out the bottom
rung<00:03:53.370> of<00:03:53.550> the<00:03:53.610> ladder<00:03:53.700> I<00:03:54.410> like<00:03:55.410> to<00:03:55.440> put<00:03:55.709> this

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
rung of the ladder I like to put this

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.850 
rung of the ladder I like to put this
back<00:03:56.160> here<00:03:56.550> and<00:03:56.730> then<00:03:57.000> dig<00:03:57.360> out<00:03:57.510> this<00:03:57.709> dig<00:03:58.709> out

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
back here and then dig out this dig out

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.070 
back here and then dig out this dig out
this<00:03:58.980> hole<00:03:59.220> and<00:03:59.430> truth<00:03:59.910> it<00:04:00.420> comes<00:04:00.630> on<00:04:00.780> through

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
this hole and truth it comes on through

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.880 
this hole and truth it comes on through
so<00:04:01.709> now<00:04:01.950> if<00:04:02.160> I<00:04:02.280> shoot<00:04:02.520> all<00:04:02.670> the<00:04:02.790> way<00:04:02.880> up<00:04:03.260> I<00:04:04.260> can

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
so now if I shoot all the way up I can

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.140 
so now if I shoot all the way up I can
go<00:04:04.980> all<00:04:05.100> the<00:04:05.220> way<00:04:05.250> up<00:04:05.400> the<00:04:05.490> water<00:04:05.640> ladder<00:04:05.880> you

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
go all the way up the water ladder you

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.030 
go all the way up the water ladder you
basically<00:04:06.540> only<00:04:06.810> need<00:04:07.020> this<00:04:07.170> little<00:04:07.440> L<00:04:07.650> shape

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
basically only need this little L shape

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.640 
basically only need this little L shape
all<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:08.730> way<00:04:08.850> down<00:04:09.120> you<00:04:10.080> don't<00:04:10.230> even<00:04:10.290> need<00:04:10.500> the

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
all the way down you don't even need the

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.680 
all the way down you don't even need the
l-shape<00:04:10.980> you<00:04:11.130> can<00:04:11.280> fill<00:04:11.489> this<00:04:12.270> whole<00:04:12.510> side

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
l-shape you can fill this whole side

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.979 
l-shape you can fill this whole side
back<00:04:12.930> in<00:04:13.170> and<00:04:13.350> have<00:04:13.440> just<00:04:13.560> a<00:04:13.709> one<00:04:13.920> by<00:04:14.130> one<00:04:14.989> you
