this fun herringbone technique that one
of<00:00:06.569> my<00:00:06.660> downline<00:00:07.109> showed<00:00:07.500> me<00:00:07.770> how<00:00:08.130> to<00:00:08.189> do<00:00:08.580> and

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
of my downline showed me how to do and

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.720 
of my downline showed me how to do and
I'm<00:00:09.360> using<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.840> new<00:00:10.080> designer<00:00:11.070> series<00:00:11.340> paper

Stampin<00:00:39.809> Up<00:00:39.899> product<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.379> we're<00:00:40.469> going<00:00:40.559> to

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
Stampin Up product that we're going to

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.880 
Stampin Up product that we're going to
be<00:00:40.770> using<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.430> there's<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.790> tape<00:00:42.000> inside<00:00:42.890> and

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
be using so there's the tape inside and

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.850 
be using so there's the tape inside and
then<00:00:44.040> what<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.309> have<00:00:44.610> done<00:00:44.850> with<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:46.410> one

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
then what I have done with this is one

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.100 
then what I have done with this is one
side<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.340> sticky<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:47.789> I've<00:00:48.030> already<00:00:48.210> added<00:00:48.690> it

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
side is sticky and I've already added it

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.090 
side is sticky and I've already added it
to<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:50.309> card<00:00:51.300> stock<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:52.079> then<00:00:52.770> what<00:00:52.949> you're

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
to the card stock and then what you're

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.410 
to the card stock and then what you're
going<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.280> do<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.820> you're<00:00:53.969> going<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.300> peel<00:00:56.420> this

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
going to do is you're going to peel this

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.000 
going to do is you're going to peel this
edge<00:00:58.230> here<00:00:58.489> to<00:00:59.489> make<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.910> sticky<00:01:00.570> if<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.680> can<00:01:01.859> get

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
edge here to make it sticky if I can get

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.430 
edge here to make it sticky if I can get
it<00:01:02.129> up<00:01:02.250> here<00:01:02.640> here<00:01:03.210> we<00:01:03.300> go

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.210 

this<00:01:08.920> is<00:01:09.040> what<00:01:09.220> we<00:01:09.310> call<00:01:09.520> operator<00:01:10.000> error<00:01:11.220> all

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
this is what we call operator error all

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.410 
this is what we call operator error all
right<00:01:12.490> and<00:01:12.670> then<00:01:12.850> we're<00:01:12.940> going<00:01:13.060> to<00:01:13.090> do<00:01:13.300> the

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
right and then we're going to do the

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.610 
right and then we're going to do the
other<00:01:13.450> part<00:01:13.990> here<00:01:14.590> and<00:01:15.430> again<00:01:15.850> this<00:01:16.780> is<00:01:17.050> really

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:17.620 
other part here and again this is really

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.400 
other part here and again this is really
sticky<00:01:18.160> underneath<00:01:18.790> there<00:01:19.240> and<00:01:19.660> this<00:01:20.200> is<00:01:20.260> a

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
sticky underneath there and this is a

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.770 
sticky underneath there and this is a
good<00:01:20.650> way<00:01:20.830> to<00:01:20.890> use<00:01:21.340> your<00:01:21.580> designer<00:01:22.450> series

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
good way to use your designer series

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.500 
good way to use your designer series
paper<00:01:23.170> when<00:01:23.560> you<00:01:23.650> have<00:01:23.860> them<00:01:24.040> in<00:01:24.220> scraps<00:01:24.820> okay

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
paper when you have them in scraps okay

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.310 
paper when you have them in scraps okay
so<00:01:26.170> I've<00:01:26.290> just<00:01:26.320> cut<00:01:26.800> a<00:01:27.070> length<00:01:27.730> here<00:01:28.360> one<00:01:29.140> of

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
so I've just cut a length here one of

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.380 
so I've just cut a length here one of
them<00:01:29.470> and<00:01:29.770> the<00:01:30.160> first<00:01:30.370> step<00:01:31.030> to<00:01:31.060> the

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
them and the first step to the

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.480 
them and the first step to the
herringbone<00:01:31.720> technique<00:01:32.380> is<00:01:32.650> to<00:01:32.800> just<00:01:33.070> run<00:01:33.310> it

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
herringbone technique is to just run it

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.770 
herringbone technique is to just run it
corner<00:01:34.300> to<00:01:34.750> corner<00:01:35.020> like<00:01:35.860> so<00:01:35.890> and<00:01:36.580> then<00:01:37.360> smush

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
corner to corner like so and then smush

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.630 
corner to corner like so and then smush
that<00:01:38.020> down<00:01:38.260> that's<00:01:38.740> the<00:01:38.860> Stampin<00:01:39.250> Up<00:01:39.400> term

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
that down that's the Stampin Up term

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.890 
that down that's the Stampin Up term
okay<00:01:40.420> and<00:01:40.690> then<00:01:41.590> the<00:01:42.190> next<00:01:42.670> piece<00:01:43.390> then<00:01:43.750> you're

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
okay and then the next piece then you're

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.690 
okay and then the next piece then you're
going<00:01:44.020> to<00:01:44.080> go<00:01:44.230> three-quarters<00:01:44.980> of<00:01:45.010> the<00:01:45.280> way<00:01:45.400> up

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
going to go three-quarters of the way up

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.820 
going to go three-quarters of the way up
and<00:01:46.090> do<00:01:46.960> it<00:01:46.990> here<00:01:47.620> and<00:01:47.890> cut<00:01:48.160> that<00:01:48.310> off<00:01:48.580> and<00:01:49.830> then

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
and do it here and cut that off and then

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.120 
and do it here and cut that off and then
we're<00:01:50.950> going<00:01:51.040> to<00:01:51.100> take<00:01:51.340> one<00:01:51.610> more<00:01:51.640> and<00:01:52.979> do<00:01:53.979> it

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
we're going to take one more and do it

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.050 
we're going to take one more and do it
on<00:01:54.310> the<00:01:54.520> lower<00:01:54.760> part<00:01:55.720> of<00:01:55.870> this<00:01:56.080> and<00:01:57.030> trim<00:01:58.030> that

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
on the lower part of this and trim that

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.730 
on the lower part of this and trim that
off<00:01:58.410> okay

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
off okay

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
off okay
so<00:02:00.400> then<00:02:00.610> there<00:02:01.420> is<00:02:01.750> your<00:02:02.320> first<00:02:02.760> layer

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
so then there is your first layer

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.180 
so then there is your first layer
basically<00:02:04.360> then<00:02:05.320> when<00:02:05.440> you<00:02:05.560> come<00:02:05.800> to<00:02:06.010> the

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
basically then when you come to the

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.400 
basically then when you come to the
second<00:02:06.640> layer<00:02:06.880> what<00:02:07.600> we're<00:02:07.750> going<00:02:07.900> to<00:02:07.930> take<00:02:08.170> is

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
second layer what we're going to take is

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.430 
second layer what we're going to take is
this<00:02:08.619> darker<00:02:09.160> one<00:02:09.369> and<00:02:09.840> then<00:02:10.840> this<00:02:11.020> is<00:02:11.200> just

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
this darker one and then this is just

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.570 
this darker one and then this is just
going<00:02:11.680> to<00:02:11.770> lay<00:02:12.070> in<00:02:12.430> here<00:02:12.880> like<00:02:13.330> so<00:02:13.810> I<00:02:14.580> think

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
going to lay in here like so I think

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.040 
going to lay in here like so I think
just<00:02:15.910> put<00:02:16.090> them<00:02:16.209> up<00:02:16.360> against<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:19.480> then<00:02:19.690> flip

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
just put them up against and then flip

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.949 
just put them up against and then flip
it<00:02:20.080> around<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:22.200> do<00:02:23.200> it<00:02:23.880> up<00:02:24.880> here<00:02:24.940> okay<00:02:25.750> and

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
it around and do it up here okay and

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.350 
it around and do it up here okay and
you're<00:02:26.770> going<00:02:27.010> to<00:02:27.070> do<00:02:27.280> that<00:02:27.489> in<00:02:27.730> this<00:02:28.000> quadrant

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
you're going to do that in this quadrant

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.260 
you're going to do that in this quadrant
this<00:02:28.870> quadrant<00:02:29.440> and<00:02:29.650> that<00:02:29.860> quadrant<00:02:30.459> then<00:02:31.090> the

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
this quadrant and that quadrant then the

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.000 
this quadrant and that quadrant then the
last<00:02:31.540> piece<00:02:31.959> that<00:02:31.989> you're<00:02:32.350> going<00:02:32.380> to<00:02:32.620> do<00:02:32.800> there

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
last piece that you're going to do there

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.699 
last piece that you're going to do there
are<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.280> last<00:02:33.489> design<00:02:34.150> is<00:02:34.510> it<00:02:35.110> again<00:02:35.410> you're

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
are the last design is it again you're

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.860 
are the last design is it again you're
just<00:02:35.860> gonna<00:02:36.010> fit<00:02:36.310> this<00:02:36.459> in<00:02:36.700> here<00:02:36.880> like<00:02:36.910> this

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
just gonna fit this in here like this

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:44.250 
just gonna fit this in here like this
and<00:02:38.370> run<00:02:39.370> it<00:02:39.489> down<00:02:40.290> cut<00:02:41.290> off<00:02:41.410> in<00:02:41.830> and<00:02:43.110> then<00:02:44.110> you

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
and run it down cut off in and then you

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.940 
and run it down cut off in and then you
put<00:02:44.500> this<00:02:44.650> one<00:02:44.890> in<00:02:45.190> and<00:02:46.320> cut<00:02:47.320> off<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.769> end

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
put this one in and cut off the end

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.340 
put this one in and cut off the end
you're<00:02:48.760> going<00:02:48.790> to<00:02:48.970> do<00:02:49.180> that<00:02:49.390> all<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.810> way<00:02:50.019> in

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
you're going to do that all the way in

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.259 
you're going to do that all the way in
each<00:02:50.560> of<00:02:50.739> these<00:02:50.860> other<00:02:51.100> three<00:02:51.519> quadrants<00:02:52.060> and

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
each of these other three quadrants and

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.180 
each of these other three quadrants and
then<00:02:52.750> you're<00:02:52.930> going<00:02:53.080> to<00:02:53.230> start<00:02:53.530> this<00:02:53.709> pattern

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
then you're going to start this pattern

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.240 
then you're going to start this pattern
all<00:02:54.400> over<00:02:54.430> so<00:02:55.060> that's<00:02:55.239> basically<00:02:56.250> the

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
all over so that's basically the

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.759 
all over so that's basically the
herringbone<00:02:57.670> technique<00:02:58.540> and<00:02:58.810> so<00:02:59.440> that<00:02:59.620> when

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
herringbone technique and so that when

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.160 
herringbone technique and so that when
you're<00:02:59.950> all<00:03:00.160> done<00:03:00.580> I've<00:03:00.970> just<00:03:01.360> continued<00:03:01.959> that

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
you're all done I've just continued that

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.060 
you're all done I've just continued that
with<00:03:02.440> all<00:03:02.650> of<00:03:02.680> these<00:03:03.989> different<00:03:04.989> designs<00:03:05.680> and

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
with all of these different designs and

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.310 
with all of these different designs and
put<00:03:06.850> it<00:03:06.940> in<00:03:07.090> here<00:03:07.269> now<00:03:07.450> you<00:03:07.480> could<00:03:07.750> do<00:03:07.900> a<00:03:07.930> four

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
put it in here now you could do a four

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.290 
put it in here now you could do a four
colors<00:03:08.769> or<00:03:09.010> two<00:03:09.160> colors<00:03:09.430> and<00:03:09.790> you<00:03:09.880> can<00:03:10.000> flip

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
colors or two colors and you can flip

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.140 
colors or two colors and you can flip
the<00:03:10.450> cardstock<00:03:10.750> over<00:03:11.350> so<00:03:11.920> there<00:03:12.160> is<00:03:12.489> the

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
the cardstock over so there is the

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.930 
the cardstock over so there is the
herringbone<00:03:13.830> technique<00:03:14.830> I<00:03:15.130> hope<00:03:15.519> you<00:03:15.640> enjoy

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
herringbone technique I hope you enjoy

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.050 
herringbone technique I hope you enjoy
it<00:03:16.120> happy<00:03:16.870> stamping
