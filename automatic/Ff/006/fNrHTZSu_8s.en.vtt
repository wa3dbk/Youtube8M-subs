 the school that has on the screen is composed in the 4 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.329
 3 3 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.640
 option 4 has 85 rating and 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.290
 has 99 m because none of the 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.360
 team players has the issue of 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.280
 loyalty but rest assured that everything 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.990
 world 2 quad is called chemistry 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.140
 and as soon as you complete games with 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.310
 the players to their chemistry 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.470
 automatically goes to this or when 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.240
 you put a technician is from some league 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.610
 I 'm going to stick with chemistry 100 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.070
 we have in the fiat bonnet in thiago decision 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.659
 silva and david luiz na zaga richarlyson 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.820
 on right side allan on side 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.280
 left in the middle of the field and with the 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.049
 we have tastes and I threw the middle 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.420
 amateur field have dengue feeling 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.729
 decision in the left end maxi lopez na 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.829
 right tip jesus navas and how 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.439
 attacker him eric johnson 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.250
 players liked around 650 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.229
 thousand 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.570
 highlights there for the fiat do not need 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.820
 cost about 170 thousand and there it should 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.680
 feel in decision and action and eric 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.119
 johnson will also cost everyone there more 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.159
 or less than 100 thousand 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.070
 the first question that will address the 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.360
 defense and I really enjoyed the 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.490
 defense of this team 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.259
 and we are going to analyze some bids there 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.810
 We steal the ball is a defense. 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.430
 also very secure in heading 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.060
 How can you tell when you bid on thiago? 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.039
 silva 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.959
 In this case I will you with the icon of mine. 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.100
 first marker but rather are David Luiz 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.680
 shoot the ball 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.780
 all the forces there last bid 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.160
 sensational defense benzema escaped by 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.490
 but we managed to disarm 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.500
 he at the time h in the goal I did not feel much 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.090
 security with the huff and totti 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.130
 I thought he was very fit. 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.830
 right here on the first throw the guy 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.520
 hit he hit and after the second 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.660
 throw 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.190
 I do not know if I had a little bit 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.590
 better prepared because the best 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.000
 and would not have rebounded more 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.130
 once rebounded and then failed 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.200
 managed to make the save there in the 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.060
 benzema and as I always say when 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.610
 you go wrong in defense and if the goalkeeper 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.680
 It is also wrong to pray that the 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.750
 Luck, help you something I liked. 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.710
 enough on the team and want very strong 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.170
 physically 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.360
 lewandowski going bad for richards 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.700
 then we get the ball there with 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.840
 dengue if he can pull 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.540
 push do not know 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.910
 the goal said in that bid and look this is 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.400
 religion does not place you on top of the 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.350
 Pepe left it on the floor without any chance. 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.140
 We can even make the goal later. 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.120
 then steal the ball with loos and cross on 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.990
 I'm sure there 's a lot of dem 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.940
 class 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:18.180
 the last move here of the physical question 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:21.180
 eric johnson putting sergio branches to 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.860
 put the ball out sensational and already 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.500
 transforming the attributes of 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.790
 header of the cards in physical nothing 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.890
 better than we continue 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.810
 showing some head moves 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.510
 this first headshot or there 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.850
 facebook david luiz and there the theory seems 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.920
 very quietly to score the 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.070
 head and I also showed a head goal 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.440
 in the defensive throw area not bad head 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:46.770
 of this team also addressing the issue 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.270
 of the pass chute positioning of this team 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.850
 I really liked that first one too. 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.890
 identical bid is left at laugh in the face 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.260
 goal and only hits the goalkeeper's 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.660
 I think it's a very good attack for me 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.210
 defend very well always well positioned 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.590
 groups leaving johnson with the ball 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:04.560
 air and goose also surprised me 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.540
 enough for a silver player who does not 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.730
 is my forte is not like gold and 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.890
 and surprised at the issue of 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.230
 quality of the guy's pass once again 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.390
 eric johnson holds the ball hope it goes 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.370
 pass puts him in front of the team 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.250
 very fast also the two points there 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.590
 lÃ©ses and rhesus navas and there with all 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.080
 mastery the whole class but can 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.819
 put the ball over the goal 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.759
 eri johnson showed that she also knows 

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:31.129
 dribbling but does not know how to kick a lot 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:33.680
 well if that 's what they can say and there 

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:35.330
 the final bid and uncle is king james ii is 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.250
 understanding very well there and hadi 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.250
 putting it in front and then nobody 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.590
 more quality shots absurd would also 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.930
 in this team's standing ball I suggest 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.879
 you use the time if his letter is 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.789
 simply monstrous he's handed it 

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:52.879
 has 99 of 92 fault accuracy strength 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:54.860
 86 of the curve and 88 of the face is 

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:57.440
 simply amazing 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.690
 but as he also has 88 head on the 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.550
 his letter at the intersections and 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.740
 I suggest you leave the 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.690
 water and leave the guy there in the middle of the 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.520
 area to try to score head 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.680
 This team is also very offensive. 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.199
 loses the ball on the attack and has eight 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.900
 players in the attacking field 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:16.039
 sensational back to our club 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.310
 so I can do my analysis 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:20.000
 on the point-to-point team the goalkeeper at 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.949
 my ver 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.020
 let the defense a little wish you 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:27.319
 no kick and managed to make the defense 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.699
 and hold the ball and gave a lot of rebound and 

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:30.500
 I did not like him very much. 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:32.990
 already in the zaga david luiz and thiago silva 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.029
 were very safe in this team gave 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.379
 opponents and 

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:38.419
 did a good job 

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:40.699
 in the same way that the sides luxa 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:43.190
 very physically strong and she does not 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:44.839
 so strong but very agile and technical 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.009
 the middle of the field was the part that I most 

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:48.139
 I like the team 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:50.389
 the goal from this half gone but I always go 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:52.370
 playing because it's very smooth and it's uncle 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:54.889
 most complete box to box game on 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.810
 my opinion attack defends very well and 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:57.800
 inside is grateful and best 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.990
 team player 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.120
 I really liked it because it is complete. 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.339
 very technical kicks and passes very well 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.650
 also very strong has excellent 

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:08.060
 header attributes in the attack had 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.210
 two players already knew and liked 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.949
 enough to play us without comment is 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.930
 half a full left-hand tip 

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:17.479
 although not very strong and jesus 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.610
 that dribbles very easy and is very 

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:21.589
 light but also strong it does not get better 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.839
 world kick eric johnson me 

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:25.490
 surprised at first but 

00:06:23.839 --> 00:06:27.770
 with the passage of time and conquered 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.629
 attention with good passes 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.819
 physical attributes and the only 

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:32.930
 he was left without his kick 

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:34.820
 Is not it those things? 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:37.850
 just like jesus navas 

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.410
 The cat of the team is 8 out of 10 a lot team 

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:41.570
 cool to play solid defense 

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:43.550
 although the goalkeeper has not gone through 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:45.560
 with interesting prices in the 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.930
 physically and physically 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.310
 mainly quite offensive 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.050
 training helps a lot in the 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:53.510
 offensive as well as the means of 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:55.700
 field that has an attack as a highlight 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:58.100
 I fully recommend you can buy without 

00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:00.200
 Fear good to read the agency was another score 

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.270
 edge I hope you have enjoyed and 

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:05.000
 I'm going to stay here a hug to 

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:08.240
 you and I went 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.820
 and there everything is right here talking and 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:13.490
 Welcome to another square today. 

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:17.830
 bringing in a school of 20 houses as 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:17.830
 Highlights buses on and badu and remy
