 the tense atmosphere at a university of 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.080
 arcs in the Midwest students lived 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.240
 moments of fear inside the classroom 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.960
 It all started after a student did 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.750

 with fear and this because during class 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.359
 university students dropped firecrackers 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.880
 runners 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.800
 a lot of people thought it was shot and the 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.439
 panic took over the place 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.830
 Everyone scared of people 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.110
 I just turned the light off. 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.670
 light I told everybody to lie down 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.280
 lying in the corner there 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.600

 everything happened a student recorded class and 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:01:04.500

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.990
 followed 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.010
 only the panic and the desperation of the 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.170
 mÃ¡laga this university that did not want 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.570
 identify that students are 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.210
 scared so much because of some 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.320
 comments involving a student of the 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.630
 university 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.210

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.810

 staff according to the rumors turned case 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.250
 because this student would have 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.659
 posted on a dating site 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.450
 comments that suggested that he 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.619
 he would commit an assault on his colleagues 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.979

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.680

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.549

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.820

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.640
 the military police became aware of the 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.750
 and went to the young man's house looking for 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.000
 weapons 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.640
 The mother is passing by saying that 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.190
 is experiencing some problems and that 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.400
 I was even thinking about it, but it seems to me 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.000
 I'm back to class, it 's normal to 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.099
 his situation but she did not let it 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.020
 expressed this possibility that he 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.000
 try suicide that has already tried suicide 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.680
 she was very sad until she was 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.110
 very surprised at this 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.459

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.480
 nothing illegal was found 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:39.209
 civilian police will now investigate the 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.280
 case to see if it was a 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.319
 bad play

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.819
 life of a student and what happened was 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.200
 a joke between friends and that 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:03:00.690
 created a ridiculous situation and 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.129
 embarrassing with his name 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.620

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.220

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.790
