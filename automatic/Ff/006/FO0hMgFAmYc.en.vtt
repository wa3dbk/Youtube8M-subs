00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
see how the weapon has changed in this

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.339 
see how the weapon has changed in this
game<00:00:10.349> so<00:00:11.190> I<00:00:11.519> was<00:00:12.000> quick<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:12.450> get<00:00:12.990> this<00:00:13.110> Tucker

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
game so I was quick to get this Tucker

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.870 
game so I was quick to get this Tucker
practice<00:00:13.769> video<00:00:14.009> out<00:00:14.130> I<00:00:14.160> pretty<00:00:14.670> much<00:00:14.759> just

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
practice video out I pretty much just

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.529 
practice video out I pretty much just
found<00:00:15.450> it<00:00:15.920> also<00:00:16.920> before<00:00:17.250> anyone<00:00:17.699> asks<00:00:17.730> i<00:00:18.150> found

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
found it also before anyone asks i found

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.109 
found it also before anyone asks i found
the<00:00:18.690> widow<00:00:18.869> on<00:00:19.080> decia<00:00:20.070> in<00:00:20.310> about<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:21.090> middle

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
the widow on decia in about the middle

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.470 
the widow on decia in about the middle
of<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.689> game<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.789> so<00:00:23.789> we<00:00:23.880> now<00:00:24.000> have<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.300> full

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
of the game and so we now have the full

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.540 
of the game and so we now have the full
suite<00:00:24.750> of<00:00:24.779> single-shot<00:00:25.650> sniper<00:00:25.980> rifles<00:00:26.430> so

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
suite of single-shot sniper rifles so

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.370 
suite of single-shot sniper rifles so
why<00:00:26.699> don't<00:00:26.849> we<00:00:26.910> compare<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.510> widow<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:28.260> the

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
why don't we compare the widow to the

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.889 
why don't we compare the widow to the
mantis<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:28.800> in<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.160> javelin<00:00:32.149> so<00:00:33.149> first<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.660> is

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
mantis and in the javelin so first it is

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.170 
mantis and in the javelin so first it is
much<00:00:34.140> heavier<00:00:34.410> than<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.770> Mantis<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.430> has

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
much heavier than the Mantis it has

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.510 
much heavier than the Mantis it has
about<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.899> same<00:00:37.140> capacity<00:00:37.530> but<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.340> is

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
about the same capacity but that is

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.740 
about the same capacity but that is
actually<00:00:38.940> misleading<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:40.340> widow<00:00:41.340> has<00:00:42.149> two

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
actually misleading the widow has two

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.500 
actually misleading the widow has two
less<00:00:43.140> shots<00:00:43.500> in<00:00:43.739> reserve<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.460> Mantis<00:00:45.030> the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
less shots in reserve and the Mantis the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.510 
less shots in reserve and the Mantis the
widow<00:00:45.750> has<00:00:46.200> seven<00:00:46.800> shots<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.219> reserved

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
widow has seven shots and reserved

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.569 
widow has seven shots and reserved
whereas<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.059> Mantis<00:00:48.510> has<00:00:49.050> nine<00:00:49.890> so<00:00:50.430> it's

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
whereas the Mantis has nine so it's

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.220 
whereas the Mantis has nine so it's
definitely<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.120> good<00:00:51.390> idea<00:00:51.420> just<00:00:51.750> like<00:00:52.110> the

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
definitely a good idea just like the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.709 
definitely a good idea just like the
other<00:00:52.410> one<00:00:52.710> shot<00:00:52.949> sniper<00:00:53.219> rifles<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:54.210> mod<00:00:54.480> it

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
other one shot sniper rifles to mod it

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:02.599 
other one shot sniper rifles to mod it
for<00:00:55.260> increased<00:00:56.010> capacity<00:00:57.620> ideally<00:01:01.460> so<00:01:02.460> but

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
for increased capacity ideally so but

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.369 
for increased capacity ideally so but
beyond<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.480> essentially<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:03.989> same

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
beyond that it is essentially the same

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.810 
beyond that it is essentially the same
it<00:01:04.739> simply<00:01:05.640> does<00:01:06.330> more<00:01:06.900> damage<00:01:07.700> compared<00:01:08.700> to

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
it simply does more damage compared to

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.899 
it simply does more damage compared to
the<00:01:08.939> Mantis<00:01:09.420> or<00:01:09.750> rather<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.290> javelin<00:01:10.909> the

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
the Mantis or rather the javelin the

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.600 
the Mantis or rather the javelin the
widow<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.600> pretty<00:01:13.350> much<00:01:13.500> exactly<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.340> same

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
widow is pretty much exactly the same

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.030 
widow is pretty much exactly the same
beyond<00:01:15.270> again<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.960> has<00:01:16.170> seven<00:01:16.710> shots<00:01:16.920> and

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
beyond again it has seven shots and

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.460 
beyond again it has seven shots and
reserve<00:01:17.310> versus<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.729> javelins<00:01:18.180> nine<00:01:18.780> but<00:01:19.380> the

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
reserve versus the javelins nine but the

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.340 
reserve versus the javelins nine but the
javelin<00:01:19.860> also<00:01:20.220> has<00:01:20.460> as<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:21.180> mentioned<00:01:22.140> in<00:01:22.320> my

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
javelin also has as I mentioned in my

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.469 
javelin also has as I mentioned in my
javelin<00:01:22.740> target<00:01:23.369> practice<00:01:23.400> episode<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.390> if

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
javelin target practice episode and if

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.030 
javelin target practice episode and if
you<00:01:24.600> want<00:01:24.810> more<00:01:24.930> info<00:01:25.259> on<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.470> javelin<00:01:25.860> you

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
you want more info on the javelin you

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.359 
you want more info on the javelin you
can<00:01:26.340> check<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.299> out<00:01:27.330> but<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.200> javelin<00:01:28.680> has<00:01:29.009> a

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
can check that out but the javelin has a

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.609 
can check that out but the javelin has a
couple<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.850> built-in<00:01:30.240> mods<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.810> can<00:01:31.320> innately

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
couple of built-in mods it can innately

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.859 
couple of built-in mods it can innately
see<00:01:32.280> targets<00:01:32.880> through<00:01:33.060> cover<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.659> through

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
see targets through cover and through

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.819 
see targets through cover and through
smoke<00:01:34.409> when<00:01:35.009> scoped<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:36.689> allegedly<00:01:37.320> can

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
smoke when scoped and it allegedly can

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.460

shoot<00:01:38.159> through<00:01:38.400> light<00:01:39.030> cover<00:01:39.420> innately<00:01:40.140> but<00:01:40.439> I

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
shoot through light cover innately but I

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.140 
shoot through light cover innately but I
again<00:01:41.189> have<00:01:41.220> not<00:01:41.549> been<00:01:41.729> able<00:01:41.850> to

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
again have not been able to

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.359 
again have not been able to
independently<00:01:42.540> confirm<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:43.470> I<00:01:43.619> have<00:01:44.009> simply

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
independently confirm that I have simply

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.490 
independently confirm that I have simply
been<00:01:44.490> told<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.210> do<00:01:45.509> know<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:46.079> when<00:01:46.380> it's

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
been told that I do know that when it's

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.800 
been told that I do know that when it's
fired<00:01:46.740> into<00:01:47.070> large<00:01:47.850> cover<00:01:48.149> into<00:01:48.390> thick<00:01:48.600> cover

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
fired into large cover into thick cover

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.560 
fired into large cover into thick cover
it<00:01:48.990> does<00:01:49.140> not<00:01:49.259> penetrate<00:01:49.560> innately<00:01:50.490> also<00:01:51.450> the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
it does not penetrate innately also the

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.460 
it does not penetrate innately also the
javelin<00:01:51.960> has<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.530> delay<00:01:53.040> so<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.810> widow<00:01:55.049> is<00:01:55.290> not

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
javelin has a delay so the widow is not

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.030 
javelin has a delay so the widow is not
encumbered<00:01:56.100> by<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.570> or<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.920> guess<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.009> could

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
encumbered by that or I guess you could

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.260 
encumbered by that or I guess you could
view<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.399> delay<00:01:59.670> is<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.820> good<00:02:00.000> thing<00:02:00.149> because

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
view the delay is a good thing because

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.179 
view the delay is a good thing because
you<00:02:00.420> can<00:02:00.540> cancel<00:02:00.719> shots<00:02:01.079> but<00:02:01.320> again<00:02:01.649> watch<00:02:01.950> the

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
you can cancel shots but again watch the

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.480 
you can cancel shots but again watch the
javelin<00:02:02.640> video<00:02:02.909> so<00:02:03.420> here's<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.869> widow<00:02:04.490> let's

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.310 
javelin video so here's the widow let's
see<00:02:05.640> how<00:02:05.790> accurate<00:02:06.240> this<00:02:06.329> weapon<00:02:06.630> is<00:02:06.750> when

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
see how accurate this weapon is when

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.790 
see how accurate this weapon is when
fired<00:02:07.619> from<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.459> hip<00:02:08.489> at<00:02:08.789> short<00:02:09.179> range

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.940 

as<00:02:14.420> you<00:02:15.420> can<00:02:15.569> see<00:02:15.750> pretty<00:02:16.050> accurate<00:02:16.590> it<00:02:16.740> does

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
as you can see pretty accurate it does

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.770 
as you can see pretty accurate it does
have<00:02:17.160> a<00:02:17.190> bit<00:02:17.370> of<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:17.550> spread<00:02:17.910> but<00:02:18.360> certainly

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
have a bit of a spread but certainly

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.559 
have a bit of a spread but certainly
accurate<00:02:19.319> enough<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:20.130> get<00:02:20.670> meat<00:02:20.910> shots<00:02:21.180> to<00:02:21.420> get

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
accurate enough to get meat shots to get

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.720 
accurate enough to get meat shots to get
center<00:02:21.930> mass<00:02:22.110> shots<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:22.680> possibly<00:02:23.490> head

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
center mass shots and possibly head

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.630 
center mass shots and possibly head
shots<00:02:23.970> as<00:02:24.390> well<00:02:24.900> which<00:02:25.830> is<00:02:26.010> pretty<00:02:26.400> much

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
shots as well which is pretty much

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.010 
shots as well which is pretty much
identical<00:02:26.820> to<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.900> Mantis<00:02:29.570> let's<00:02:30.570> try<00:02:30.780> at

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
identical to the Mantis let's try at

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:59.630 
identical to the Mantis let's try at
medium<00:02:31.500> range<00:02:32.060> mid<00:02:33.060> range<00:02:58.010> so<00:02:59.010> as<00:02:59.130> you<00:02:59.250> can<00:02:59.400> see

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
medium range mid range so as you can see

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.090 
medium range mid range so as you can see
it<00:02:59.820> does<00:03:00.000> still<00:03:00.209> have<00:03:00.390> some<00:03:00.630> minor<00:03:00.870> spread<00:03:01.350> you

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
it does still have some minor spread you

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.729 
it does still have some minor spread you
probably<00:03:03.030> can<00:03:03.300> still<00:03:03.570> get<00:03:03.840> center<00:03:04.170> mass<00:03:04.410> shots

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
probably can still get center mass shots

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.770 
probably can still get center mass shots
well<00:03:05.250> enough<00:03:05.519> but<00:03:05.970> headshots<00:03:06.239> are

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
well enough but headshots are

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.350 
well enough but headshots are
problematic<00:03:07.620> at<00:03:07.950> mid<00:03:08.220> range<00:03:08.430> which<00:03:08.700> is<00:03:08.730> very

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
problematic at mid range which is very

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.880 
problematic at mid range which is very
similar<00:03:09.660> to<00:03:09.780> both<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:10.350> mantis<00:03:10.709> and<00:03:10.800> the

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
similar to both the mantis and the

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.979 
similar to both the mantis and the
javelin<00:03:12.260> let's<00:03:13.260> try<00:03:13.530> mid-to-long<00:03:14.250> range<00:03:14.989> from

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
javelin let's try mid-to-long range from

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:22.809 
javelin let's try mid-to-long range from
the<00:03:16.200> hip<00:03:16.320> with<00:03:16.350> the<00:03:16.620> widow

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.360 

and<00:03:23.819> at<00:03:24.810> this<00:03:24.930> point<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.470> spread<00:03:25.829> is<00:03:26.040> really

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
and at this point the spread is really

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.699 
and at this point the spread is really
becoming<00:03:26.670> a<00:03:26.849> problem<00:03:29.989> one<00:03:30.989> shot<00:03:31.200> completely

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
becoming a problem one shot completely

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.800 
becoming a problem one shot completely
missed<00:03:31.950> one<00:03:32.700> shot<00:03:32.909> hit<00:03:33.090> center<00:03:33.329> mass<00:03:33.360> but<00:03:33.720> that

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
missed one shot hit center mass but that

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.119 
missed one shot hit center mass but that
was<00:03:33.989> a<00:03:34.140> headshot<00:03:35.599> so<00:03:36.599> by<00:03:37.379> mid<00:03:37.620> to<00:03:37.739> long<00:03:37.890> range

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:38.129 
was a headshot so by mid to long range

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:39.679 
was a headshot so by mid to long range
you<00:03:38.400> really<00:03:38.700> should<00:03:38.849> not<00:03:38.970> be<00:03:39.150> aiming<00:03:39.450> for<00:03:39.569> head

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:39.689 
you really should not be aiming for head

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:41.780 
you really should not be aiming for head
shots<00:03:39.720> anymore<00:03:40.170> if<00:03:40.560> you<00:03:40.890> are<00:03:41.010> no<00:03:41.159> scoping<00:03:41.640> and

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
shots anymore if you are no scoping and

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.429 
shots anymore if you are no scoping and
should<00:03:42.329> just<00:03:42.540> be<00:03:42.689> aiming<00:03:42.989> for<00:03:43.200> center<00:03:43.379> mass

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:43.439 
should just be aiming for center mass

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:46.250 
should just be aiming for center mass
shots<00:03:43.879> but<00:03:44.879> considering<00:03:45.480> how<00:03:45.750> little<00:03:45.930> anal

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
shots but considering how little anal

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.539 
shots but considering how little anal
this<00:03:46.349> weapon<00:03:46.650> has<00:03:46.680> you're<00:03:47.220> pretty<00:03:47.489> much

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
this weapon has you're pretty much

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.330 
this weapon has you're pretty much
wasting<00:03:48.269> your<00:03:48.450> ammo<00:03:48.780> no<00:03:49.650> scoping<00:03:50.040> at<00:03:50.189> this

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
wasting your ammo no scoping at this

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.379 
wasting your ammo no scoping at this
range<00:03:50.579> you<00:03:50.700> really<00:03:50.970> should<00:03:51.150> be<00:03:51.180> getting

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389 
range you really should be getting

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:56.270 
range you really should be getting
headshots<00:03:51.859> with<00:03:52.859> the<00:03:53.190> scope<00:03:53.549> and<00:03:55.280> again

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
headshots with the scope and again

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.069 
headshots with the scope and again
pretty<00:03:56.549> much<00:03:56.730> totally<00:03:57.120> ineffective<00:03:57.420> but<00:03:57.930> it

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
pretty much totally ineffective but it

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.899 
pretty much totally ineffective but it
could<00:03:58.260> have<00:03:58.349> hit<00:03:58.560> both<00:03:59.220> of<00:03:59.370> these<00:03:59.459> shots<00:03:59.639> could

00:03:59.899 --> 00:03:59.909 
could have hit both of these shots could

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:01.789 
could have hit both of these shots could
have<00:04:00.000> hit<00:04:00.120> it's<00:04:00.299> just<00:04:00.480> a<00:04:00.540> complete<00:04:00.930> gamble<00:04:01.349> so

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
have hit it's just a complete gamble so

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.530 
have hit it's just a complete gamble so
I<00:04:02.069> only<00:04:02.340> recommend<00:04:02.700> no<00:04:02.909> scoping<00:04:03.269> with<00:04:03.420> this

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
I only recommend no scoping with this

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.929 
I only recommend no scoping with this
weapon<00:04:03.689> at<00:04:04.019> point-blank<00:04:04.379> range<00:04:04.470> and<00:04:05.040> short

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:05.939 
weapon at point-blank range and short

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:07.899 
weapon at point-blank range and short
range<00:04:06.239> I<00:04:06.510> suppose<00:04:07.049> you<00:04:07.170> could<00:04:07.260> go<00:04:07.409> for

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:07.909 
range I suppose you could go for

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:10.460 
range I suppose you could go for
midsection<00:04:08.909> shots<00:04:09.150> torso<00:04:09.629> shots<00:04:09.900> at<00:04:10.139> mid

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
midsection shots torso shots at mid

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.800 
midsection shots torso shots at mid
range<00:04:10.709> but<00:04:11.220> probably<00:04:11.670> not<00:04:11.849> a<00:04:11.909> good<00:04:12.030> idea<00:04:12.150> you

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
range but probably not a good idea you

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.300 
range but probably not a good idea you
really<00:04:13.049> should<00:04:13.319> be<00:04:13.500> using<00:04:13.889> this<00:04:14.129> weapon

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
really should be using this weapon

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.779 
really should be using this weapon

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
as you can see things are looking good

00:04:43.080 --> 00:05:00.649 
as you can see things are looking good
dead<00:04:44.080> center<00:04:46.860> by<00:04:47.860> mid-range<00:04:57.689> still<00:04:58.689> excellent

00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:00.659 
dead center by mid-range still excellent

dead center by mid-range still excellent
let's<00:05:01.659> try<00:05:01.869> mid-to-long<00:05:02.589> range<00:05:09.869> my<00:05:10.869> mouse<00:05:11.080> is

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
let's try mid-to-long range my mouse is

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:17.009 
let's try mid-to-long range my mouse is
acting<00:05:11.619> up<00:05:11.740> today<00:05:11.860> it<00:05:12.099> seems<00:05:15.719> zoom<00:05:16.719> doesn't

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:17.019 
acting up today it seems zoom doesn't

00:05:17.019 --> 00:05:23.579 
acting up today it seems zoom doesn't

much perfect accuracy no noticeable
spread<00:05:26.669> let's<00:05:27.669> try<00:05:27.819> long-range

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.040 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:46.220 

looking<00:05:41.040> good<00:05:44.450> so<00:05:45.450> as<00:05:45.600> you<00:05:45.780> can<00:05:45.900> see<00:05:46.080> this

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:46.230 
looking good so as you can see this

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:48.170 
looking good so as you can see this
weapon<00:05:46.530> is<00:05:46.710> extremely<00:05:47.490> accurate<00:05:47.880> at<00:05:48.000> any

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180

range<00:05:48.480> when<00:05:48.750> scoped<00:05:50.480> in<00:05:51.480> fact<00:05:51.900> it<00:05:52.140> very<00:05:52.320> well

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
range when scoped in fact it very well

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.010 
range when scoped in fact it very well
might<00:05:52.650> have<00:05:52.890> perfect<00:05:53.400> accuracy<00:05:54.020> obviously

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
might have perfect accuracy obviously

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.150 
might have perfect accuracy obviously
there's<00:05:55.170> a<00:05:55.230> little<00:05:55.440> margin<00:05:55.620> of<00:05:55.770> error<00:05:55.860> because

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:56.160 
there's a little margin of error because

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.120 
there's a little margin of error because
I<00:05:56.190> am<00:05:56.490> not<00:05:56.520> perfect<00:05:56.880> in<00:05:57.150> my<00:05:57.360> aim<00:05:57.680> so<00:05:58.680> again<00:05:59.010> this

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130 
I am not perfect in my aim so again this

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.190 
I am not perfect in my aim so again this

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 
differences being that it does more

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.660 
differences being that it does more
damage<00:06:08.940> than<00:06:09.390> the<00:06:09.450> Mantis<00:06:10.040> but<00:06:11.040> it<00:06:11.190> has<00:06:11.370> less

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:11.670

shots<00:06:11.970> in<00:06:12.240> reserve<00:06:12.930> and<00:06:13.110> identical<00:06:13.890> damage<00:06:14.160> to

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 
shots in reserve and identical damage to

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.610

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620 
the javelin while having left shots and

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.270 
the javelin while having left shots and
reserve<00:06:16.860> but<00:06:17.370> the<00:06:17.670> javelin<00:06:18.150> has<00:06:18.780> the<00:06:19.740> delay

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 
reserve but the javelin has the delay

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.360 
reserve but the javelin has the delay
