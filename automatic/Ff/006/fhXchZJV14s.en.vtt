00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:12.929
 hello then today I you 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.830
 found to present you from what 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.049
 way is what we can achieve 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.680
 easily solar oils at home 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.990
 and at a lower cost, of course, so 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.400
 constituent level of 7.8 it's going 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.630
 to be fast enough so I'm going to get you 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.369
 show there is no need to have a lot 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.910
 of ingredients and I explained 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.309
 what property to each product so 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.050
 we will start with basic water line 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.250
 Shea Our shea line ever 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.079
 already spoken in a previous video 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.360
 it's really something that is 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.910
 really very very good for the skin so 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.440
 it's always beneficial to use 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.180
 in solar wind care and after 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.440
 solar because it is very nourishing 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.390
 in addition to being very nourishing and 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.550
 skin protector it's going to have a 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.020
 action against uv so I do not say 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.520
 that it will push you all the uv but 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.329
 it's going to push back a few and that's 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.370
 always good to take 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.570
 then one has the oil of his will more 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.120
 of rice bran it's pretty much the same 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.829
 thing so it pushes a lot of rays 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.449
 uv and in addition it is an action against the 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.580
 skin aging so that's 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.970
 just ideal to integrate into an island 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.729
 solar 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.860
 we continue with sesame oil 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.270
 sesame oil that is exactly 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.490
 same thing it also absorbs 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.350
 uv rays her restructure the skin so 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.540
 it's the same it's always good to 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.950
 when we expect to expose ourselves to 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.750
 sun knowing that the sun is 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.159
 always very irritating to the skin is 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.290
 the last of the oils as to use 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.240
 buriti cell so boichi oil 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.070
 if my memories are correct it absorbs 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.409
 in fact it was he who absorbs more 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.509
 UV rays in very good quantity 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.159
 after you are going to need a 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.439
 container I simply use 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:42.340
 a bottle with a mini bottle 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:44.350
 evian and there one to the dosing syringe 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.030
 so they measure up to 25 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.100
 milliliters that I'm going to use 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.229
 only to collect online from 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.030
 quality and a theory that will be everything so 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.860
 we will not have quantities 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.600
 phenomenal oil water 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.070
 but on the one hand I would say so much better 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.689
 because in general in the trade one 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.119
 always tends to sell you 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:02.619
 great south of products that can 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.000
 last for several years, but 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.319
 inside you have preservatives 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.580
 it was before that it's about oil 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:09.700
 of olives and oil in general 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:13.000
 rather well but from a point of view 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.380
 practical safety come I think 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.120
 it's better to talk about all 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.220
 small quantities that are just going to get you 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.480
 will be enough summer is here we go 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.610
 take our little evian bottle at 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.530
 level of sterilization conditions 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.680
 drop was pretty flexible this as he 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.810
 this is only the oil the 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.310
 bacteria will not occur and will not 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.790
 do not develop in oil where there is no 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.079
 no water there is no 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.420
 of life so you do not necessarily have 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:36.920
 need to sterilize the bottle you 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.180
 clean it just right and then 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:44.540
 so it will see start emptying 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.310
 our three little practices violates the 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.200
 shows the little scoop so knowing that 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:56.239
 a vial like that represents 10 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:57.739
 milliliters it's gone you want well 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.879
 but it's you see this subject late I 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.280
 just ask do I do not know if you 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:04.159
 I do not want to ask 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.290
 return the bottle story as the oil 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:08.420
 emptied completely of the bottle so 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.040
 you're going to let go go we're gonna 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.290
 say three minutes story let him be 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.730
 really well everything down it will avoid 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.169
 to waste it because it makes 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.459
 always sick to the textures a 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:19.010
 little oil to them stay well 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.260
 hanging on to the parish and we always 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.959
 tendency to lose it would be a pity 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.290
 we will do the same with luc de bauw 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.290
 litigation 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.440
 we will do the same thing now 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:48.510
 with sesame oil is a lot 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.510
 more convenient like that 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.800
 and finally we will put water 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.060
 shea line so one of quality I 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.010
 thought I was going to dose and at the 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.510
 pipette you see and finally I 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.730
 think I can do like that being 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:08.630
 given that it's going to be a bit more 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:10.220
 complex what so there you see that 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.690
 I already used a little water 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:15.710
 the lines not much 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:18.739
 so here you see that there I have 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:21.020
 all this happens I'll see I'm going 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.940
 leave only 2 cm in the bottom 

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:24.200
 because I'm going to need no 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.420
 quality line for another product 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.770
 so it's really in the eye but 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.090
 Really, it's not serious at all 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.560
 given that water quality line i'm going 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.450
 just use it to make a 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.770
 cruise a bit more 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.190
 consistent because the water line 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.050
 quality 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.270
 it's not really like a night of 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:44.810
 simple it's really much more 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:46.700
 creamy and here we are dealing with a 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.190
 minute all orange I would be curious to 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.050
 to know if on the skin it's that sticky or 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.430
 not so there I saw you I put the 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.430
 I'm missing a little oil 

00:05:00.309 --> 00:05:04.669
 well it brings a slight influence to 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.339
 level of your skin I 'm not saying that 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:10.279
 you cohort a self-tanner but that 

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:11.990
 leaves a veil really subtle and light 

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:14.949
 on the skin and I also think it's 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:17.569
 that contributes to the protection of UV 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:20.479
 so that's it kills you can the 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:21.949
 keep as you are used to 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:24.439
 to do it in a plane tree 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:25.759
 simple pharmacy closet or if you have 

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:27.349
 a little chilly and you're scared 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:28.999
 transat rigaud is not very serious 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:30.830
 you have had your summer and here I 

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:33.259
 think that considering how much you can 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.370
 use it for all summer but for a 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:36.710
 only person 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.330
 on the other hand my life so I hope that the 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.229
 recipe you will have pleased I tell you to 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.229
 soon for next
