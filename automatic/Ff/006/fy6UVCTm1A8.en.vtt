00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 a great hello to all today 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.700
 you about 4 hairstyles that can be 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.470
 use school 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.510
 especially for you I prepared it 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.370
 hairstyles that are very simple and there are 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.780
 harder stupidly less time 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.780
 need somewhere more 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.020
 and let's start for the first hairstyle on 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.460
 you need to divide your hair into three parts 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.500
 a little hair one edge a little 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.710
 hair of the other end and in the center 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:50.269
 most of all hair is this hair which is 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:52.670
 center we tie in low tail and 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:57.160
 greasy hair do a bundle and not 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.160
 we throw on the gum on the tail 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.210
 and under the tail we fix elastic 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:11.060
 rubber band can also be fixed 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.060
 invisible but I like it better 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.060
 rezinochka 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.840
 to do the next hairstyle to us 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.360
 need to separate again the edges of a little hair 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.170
 from the other side a little hair since i 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.920
 behind 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.920
 secure in the center of elastic rubber 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.630
 and so here turn the hair after 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:57.180
 why give them a little volume and what 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.160
 more hair you take to cut and how was 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.740
 more beautiful and more voluminous will be your hairstyle 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:05.700
 on and today decided to take a little 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.830
 hair i do so three times on you can 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.780
 use all your hair does 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.320
 let's say otno times how old you are in general 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.320
 I want to 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.470
 for the next hairstyle, I again need 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.690
 take a little hair from one edge and 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.120
 a little hair of another dye again 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.610
 we will be back again but a little closer to 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:46.480
 one edge, that is, let go rule lirium 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:49.330
 no difference after which we take again 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.760
 a little bit of both of them 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.370
 and fasten closer to the other edge 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.050
 so you can weave while 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.600
 you will not run out of hair that is to say 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.100
 the end we we get somewhere in the middle 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.850
 because I like to leave 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.470
 namely the tail so I do but 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.970
 you can generally experiment and 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.970
 try to do differently 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:41.560
 for the next hairstyle we need to take 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:45.490
 hair divide them into two parts like this 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:49.180
 that's how I have to intertwine them between 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:52.570
 each time adding a little bit 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.850
 hair when given kerr spirit can 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:58.060
 stop with the addition of hair and just 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:00.940
 twist your hair to the end when you 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.720
 do it and the garden needs to be fixed 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.720
 invisible 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.799
 we throw hair on one side so that 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.420
 invisibility was no less and do more 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.280
 at your discretion can leave 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.550
 loose hair can braid 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:29.639
 pigtail can do any 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.639
 flagella I personally washed down the spikelet 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:45.330
 with not the last step to eat a little 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:48.840
 a pigtail some more volume to do 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:51.180
 That's all for this end of May 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:54.920
 saw indis it was very helpful to you 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.920
 love you and not yet
