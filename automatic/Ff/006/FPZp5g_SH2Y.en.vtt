00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:09.719
 hello you love first I give myself 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.630
 here is my prem from nivea on that 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.990
 the pure nature and next 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.580
 I mean everything to him extreme and that 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.380
 I always do that at the very beginning 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.369
 the layer is really dry so well 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.990
 the first shift because yes I weigh 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.760
 my eyelashes are always at the very end and the 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.279
 should be dry by then and then 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.690
 I give my foundation of dior that 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:39.920
 here is the 4 40 40 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:42.059
 with the flex kabuki 80 from sigma on and 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.680
 she knows that this is mine 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.730
 face fits just fine and only on mine 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.410
 because it is kind of a bit 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.230
 the darker my forehead was there I will 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.489
 after a brown hair well away ringier 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.320
 could you see, I have just the 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.180
 second layer made of mascara 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.420
 so that it dries well until then 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.180
 and next to this zuewa 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.430
 101 salmon face the fine brush and of 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.629
 bobby brown golden grief and contours 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.670
 girls face here namely the 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.590
 Two seater away and could still me 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.119
 a bit of a nose because of the brush 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.270
 is simply much faster and more accurately 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.680
 as the big fund uefa and then give 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.340
 I remember the very last and third 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.920
 layer of with the benefit series 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.110
 Here I have such a small sample 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.479
 then bought and then I'm doing 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.659
 even the eyebrows 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:29.850
 I take here from aldi's 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.079
 own brand against it 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.960
 eyebrow pencil and that's really 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.700
 Good, I am glad that I still have 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.380
 one bought and one more 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.390
 for blonde so the two still 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.189
 I can give away and I liked that 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.079
 really like it until now and then 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.810
 I take a code ip- and do all 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.640
 all the mascara so the whole why me 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.579
 glad has smeared and behind 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.170
 my eyes gone and yes that was good now 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.329
 that I take even a German 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.329
 concealer and we give up here 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:00.119
 my whole eyelid so that's nice 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.890
 looks even and then I take 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.530
 here from the kts range this is a 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.770
 concealer palette this orange 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.659
 correct tone and this peggy tone ensures 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.000
 for giving her this 

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:15.250
 greyish dark so dark circles 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.930
 have disappeared and then you can 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.120
 you also completely calm your concealer 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.769
 apply because he does not see then 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.209
 Gray, you know what I mean 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.349
 I 'm making such a stupid noise 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.019
 Yes, and I did that yesterday 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.579
 Read and help this stuff 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:30.400
 really so i just have to 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:31.659
 patrice taken that pitching tone yes 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.109
 and next I'll take off from here 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:36.849
 my tablet kabuki f 86 and have me 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:38.260
 so my short deludes and you 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:40.329
 I already do it in all 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.169
 your stroke with the master plus you 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:45.370
 I think that is from Berlin and 

00:02:44.169 --> 00:02:49.859
 then I'll do the lower one 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:52.389
 eyelashes next, I give myself from 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:54.189
 flower power means that's what I think 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:57.129
 Of course I will do everything in the world for you 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:58.599
 infobox put on the cheeks and 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:01.049
 that does not blind you well that way 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:04.299
 and of course it looks 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:07.239
 because of Mary Luminal since then 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:08.829
 highlighter and a highlighter brush 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.079
 from sigma and give me that on the 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:14.139
 cheekbones also on and on the 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:18.909
 nose bridge and then I take off 

00:03:14.139 --> 00:03:20.919
 kiko the number 601 and that's one 

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:22.150
 matt really nice should you 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:23.739
 look at you and then namely from 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.150
 ebeling my eyelash curler as you see 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.129
 can now in my five at all 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.470
 dry and then I have those too 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:31.659
 right there I still give myself of de mail 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.040
 a what eye under and connect 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:37.329
 the one with a blender brush 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.680
 little office and yes I just have 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:41.250
 cut too fast because of that 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.449
 I do not come with the talking afterwards 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.069
 As you can see I have my wood 

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:47.709
 came and caught on the tips 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:50.470
 to comb my hair and work 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.090
 me so high that makes yours 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.949
 stay healthy and not the tips 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.049
 somehow all knots are pulling 

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:56.439
 and you have that's not true 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.930
 beautiful 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:01.180
 your tips will be destroyed right there 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.569
 go and I want to go next 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.729
 my hair and that is that 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.560
 I have sent modules for that 

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:10.419
 get to test and I'm like that 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.020
 I love to give it to you voluntarily 

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:15.300
 show that there is handy 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.760
 powerfully robust with an ion 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.190
 technology and reduces static 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.720
 the whole volume will dry the hair 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.120
 faster and also saves energy 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.090
 and I think that's really great 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.860
 super strong the only thing I have 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.540
 to complain about something but have 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.100
 because he really can not do anything anymore 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.810
 it just just holds the power 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.000
 little knot in the hair because of 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.370
 read air out that your hair 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.600
 nullkommanichts dried are yes and 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.700
 then i got john frieda's 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.680
 heat protection song on it and would come 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.570
 you carefully see my hair again 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.240
 they could be knotted a bit more 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.590
 because of the hair dryer is really not 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.180
 bad for that my hair is easy 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.480
 times dry ten minutes faster 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:56.490
 and then i take the model the model 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.810
 flat iron and there is saving on it 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.430
 energy because that's a motion sensor 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.620
 inside and if you do not move then 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.320
 you do not pull out any energy because of that 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.390
 power saving is already very good and 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.330
 it's really easy so you can 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.560
 you can hold it very easily in your hand and 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:14.190
 will warm very quickly similar 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.810
 ti offers that the straighteners people 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.880
 is yes again and there you see that 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.910
 again completely you see how beautiful 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.610
 So my hair really shines 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.830
 great compared to the other side 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.660
 and can you see that really well ? 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.600
 I'm excited about the quiet and who 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:33.960
 Use this more often 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.639
 So I really like that and so much 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:39.780
 as you can see it all goes completely 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:41.550
 fast and it is very easy too and 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.530
 So I really like it very much 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.449
 that is not sponsored or so i say 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.000
 that actually girls I do that 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:50.520

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.849
 august a hairdressing appointment I should mean 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.710
 just hair just so the approach again 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:57.870
 to dye or what do you mean what should 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.330
