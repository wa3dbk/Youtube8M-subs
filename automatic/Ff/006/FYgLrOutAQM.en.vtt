vulnerable in our own half and that's

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.970 
vulnerable in our own half and that's
where<00:00:59.940> exactly<00:01:00.510> where<00:01:00.809> United<00:01:01.260> expose<00:01:01.590> us<00:01:01.800> for

natural Monroe I'm going to give a five
out<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.080> 10<00:01:07.290> rating<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:07.799> one<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:07.979> think<00:01:08.040> given

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
out of 10 rating this one I think given

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:09.890 
out of 10 rating this one I think given
that<00:01:08.580> he<00:01:08.880> was<00:01:09.000> being<00:01:09.090> played<00:01:09.390> out<00:01:09.510> position

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
that he was being played out position

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.109 
that he was being played out position
once<00:01:10.200> more<00:01:10.500> he<00:01:10.920> had<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.040> fav<00:01:11.280> decent<00:01:11.700> game<00:01:11.820> held

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
once more he had a fav decent game held

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.520 
once more he had a fav decent game held
his<00:01:12.210> position<00:01:12.330> rather<00:01:12.750> well<00:01:13.020> at<00:01:13.140> times<00:01:13.290> and

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
his position rather well at times and

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.130 
his position rather well at times and
certainly<00:01:14.100> covered<00:01:14.670> for<00:01:14.939> permits<00:01:15.450> occur<00:01:15.630> when

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
certainly covered for permits occur when

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.749 
certainly covered for permits occur when
he<00:01:16.259> was<00:01:16.380> leaving<00:01:16.500> him<00:01:16.799> alone<00:01:16.830> at<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.490> back<00:01:17.729> of

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
he was leaving him alone at the back of

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.640 
he was leaving him alone at the back of
the<00:01:17.939> pitch<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:18.900> think<00:01:19.140> one<00:01:19.320> thing<00:01:19.350> that

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
the pitch and I think one thing that

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.530 
the pitch and I think one thing that
really<00:01:19.680> was<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.610> positive<00:01:20.820> for<00:01:21.090> more<00:01:21.210> air<00:01:21.390> today

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
really was a positive for more air today

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.090 
really was a positive for more air today
was<00:01:21.810> there<00:01:21.930> he<00:01:22.049> was<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.350> less<00:01:22.619> inclined<00:01:23.100> to

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
was there he was so less inclined to

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.830 
was there he was so less inclined to

seeing of him recently you could also

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.340 
seeing of him recently you could also
argue<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.270> he<00:01:42.479> was<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.630> full<00:01:42.930> put<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.140> goal
