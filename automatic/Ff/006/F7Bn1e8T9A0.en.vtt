00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.529 
that if they'd use I don't know some
kind<00:05:14.889> of<00:05:15.250> ghost<00:05:15.699> move<00:05:15.969> I<00:05:16.090> don't<00:05:16.240> think<00:05:16.389> they

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:16.539 
kind of ghost move I don't think they

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:19.709 
kind of ghost move I don't think they
would<00:05:16.719> have<00:05:16.870> because<00:05:17.229> you<00:05:17.439> know<00:05:17.879> apps<00:05:18.879> all<00:05:19.419> is

00:05:19.709 --> 00:05:19.719 
would have because you know apps all is

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:22.170 
would have because you know apps all is
dark<00:05:20.409> so<00:05:20.740> i<00:05:20.949> don't<00:05:21.430> know<00:05:21.490> i<00:05:21.520> just<00:05:21.610> switched<00:05:21.849> in

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
dark so i don't know i just switched in

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.629 
dark so i don't know i just switched in
just<00:05:22.360> because<00:05:22.509> I<00:05:22.659> could<00:05:22.930> and<00:05:23.169> I<00:05:23.919> used<00:05:24.189> protect

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:24.639 
just because I could and I used protect

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:26.010 
just because I could and I used protect
with<00:05:24.849> swell<00:05:25.120> just<00:05:25.330> to<00:05:25.479> make<00:05:25.629> sure<00:05:25.659> that<00:05:25.990> I

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
with swell just to make sure that I

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.829 
with swell just to make sure that I
don't<00:05:26.080> get<00:05:26.620> attacked<00:05:27.009> you<00:05:27.339> know<00:05:27.629> because<00:05:28.629> that

00:05:28.829 --> 00:05:28.839 
don't get attacked you know because that

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:32.369 
don't get attacked you know because that
would<00:05:29.110> be<00:05:29.139> bad<00:05:29.529> and<00:05:29.800> then<00:05:30.580> so<00:05:31.389> the<00:05:32.020> twitters

00:05:32.369 --> 00:05:32.379 
would be bad and then so the twitters

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:33.540 
would be bad and then so the twitters
dimension<00:05:32.710> from<00:05:32.800> the<00:05:32.949> norm<00:05:33.159> which<00:05:33.310> means

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
dimension from the norm which means

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.640 
dimension from the norm which means
trims<00:05:34.029> down<00:05:34.120> and<00:05:34.569> that<00:05:34.960> clamp<00:05:35.259> rolls<00:05:35.469> not

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
trims down and that clamp rolls not

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.040 
trims down and that clamp rolls not
going<00:05:35.800> to<00:05:35.860> do<00:05:36.039> much<00:05:36.190> so<00:05:36.520> she<00:05:36.550> switches<00:05:37.029> out<00:05:37.360> to

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
going to do much so she switches out to
