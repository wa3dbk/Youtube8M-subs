is that actually sat okay but we'll have
another<00:00:07.259> clip<00:00:07.589> over<00:00:07.799> here<00:00:08.870> which<00:00:09.870> is<00:00:10.050> to<00:00:10.200> tie

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
another clip over here which is to tie

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.370 
another clip over here which is to tie
to<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.650> cable<00:00:11.040> that<00:00:11.130> we're<00:00:11.250> going<00:00:11.400> to<00:00:11.490> remove

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:12.380

can be a bit fiddly sometimes to remove
this<00:00:18.510> tape<00:00:18.840> site<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.920> if<00:00:20.010> you've<00:00:20.189> got<00:00:20.369> nails

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
this tape site and if you've got nails

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.200 
this tape site and if you've got nails
you<00:00:20.850> can<00:00:21.060> use<00:00:21.270> our<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.900> well<00:00:23.000> and<00:00:24.000> we're<00:00:24.090> going

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
you can use our a well and we're going

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.070 
you can use our a well and we're going
to<00:00:24.269> sit<00:00:24.480> that<00:00:24.890> over<00:00:25.890> here<00:00:26.720> so<00:00:27.720> it's<00:00:27.869> nice<00:00:28.050> and

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
to sit that over here so it's nice and

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.290 
to sit that over here so it's nice and
tidy<00:00:28.500> there

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
tidy there

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.400 
tidy there
so<00:00:30.529> now<00:00:31.529> back<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.009> continuous<00:00:32.669> ink<00:00:32.880> system

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
so now back to the continuous ink system

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.540 
so now back to the continuous ink system
within<00:00:34.410> your<00:00:34.530> accessory<00:00:35.190> pack<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.940> bag<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:37.050> bits

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
within your accessory pack a bag of bits

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.340 
within your accessory pack a bag of bits
there<00:00:38.550> are<00:00:38.700> some<00:00:38.940> air<00:00:39.090> filters<00:00:39.629> anything<00:00:40.200> else

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
there are some air filters anything else

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.810 
there are some air filters anything else
that's<00:00:40.530> left<00:00:40.860> in<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.129> bag<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.610> don't

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
that's left in the bag that you don't

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.900 
that's left in the bag that you don't
use<00:00:42.180> they<00:00:42.870> are<00:00:43.050> spares<00:00:43.550> just<00:00:44.550> in<00:00:44.700> case

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
use they are spares just in case

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.420 
use they are spares just in case
anything<00:00:45.450> goes<00:00:46.230> wrong<00:00:46.410> will<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.800> need<00:00:47.190> them

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
anything goes wrong will you need them

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.639 
anything goes wrong will you need them
at<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:48.210> know<00:00:48.360> when<00:00:48.539> she<00:00:48.719> warranties<00:00:49.230> run<00:00:49.469> out

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
at you know when she warranties run out

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.069 
at you know when she warranties run out
so<00:00:49.860> these<00:00:50.010> systems<00:00:50.280> do<00:00:50.760> come<00:00:51.059> with<00:00:51.780> twelve

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
so these systems do come with twelve

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.080 
so these systems do come with twelve
months<00:00:52.379> warranty<00:00:52.620> if<00:00:53.129> anything<00:00:53.489> fails<00:00:53.760> within

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
months warranty if anything fails within

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.810 
months warranty if anything fails within
that<00:00:54.329> time<00:00:54.629> we<00:00:55.350> will<00:00:55.530> replace<00:00:55.890> that<00:00:55.949> part<00:00:56.550> will

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
that time we will replace that part will

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.229 
that time we will replace that part will
replace<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.449> whole<00:00:57.600> system<00:00:58.520> so<00:00:59.520> these<00:01:00.059> are

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
replace the whole system so these are

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.849 
replace the whole system so these are
the<00:01:00.329> air<00:01:00.449> filters<00:01:00.989> when<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.289> look<00:01:01.440> at<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.710> air

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
the air filters when you look at the air

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.729 
the air filters when you look at the air
filter<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.460> has<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.640> narrow<00:01:03.480> pointy<00:01:04.170> end<00:01:04.350> and

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
filter it has a narrow pointy end and

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.789 
filter it has a narrow pointy end and
then<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.010> short<00:01:05.369> fat<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.110> you<00:01:07.110> need<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.439> remove

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
then a short fat and you need to remove

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:17.030 
then a short fat and you need to remove
the<00:01:08.189> small<00:01:08.490> flat<00:01:09.060> plugs<00:01:11.270> from<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.479> system<00:01:16.040> and

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
the small flat plugs from the system and

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.780 
the small flat plugs from the system and
the<00:01:17.159> air<00:01:17.280> filters<00:01:17.820> will<00:01:18.030> go<00:01:18.240> in<00:01:18.509> there<00:01:19.790> three

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
the air filters will go in there three

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:28.630 
the air filters will go in there three
or<00:01:24.049> so<00:01:26.060> and<00:01:27.060> then<00:01:27.299> it's<00:01:27.479> flattened<00:01:27.990> down

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
or so and then it's flattened down

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.620 
or so and then it's flattened down
straight<00:01:29.640> in<00:01:29.880> line<00:01:31.520> so<00:01:32.520> one<00:01:32.759> bit<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.000> did<00:01:33.299> skip

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
straight in line so one bit I did skip

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.210 
straight in line so one bit I did skip
right<00:01:33.900> at<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.200> start<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.650> video<00:01:34.770> when

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
right at the start of the video when

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.640 
right at the start of the video when
your<00:01:35.369> primary<00:01:35.670> system<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:37.350> need<00:01:37.500> to

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
your primary system is that you need to

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.249 
your primary system is that you need to
make<00:01:37.829> sure<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.070> this<00:01:38.460> tube<00:01:38.790> roller<00:01:39.090> is<00:01:39.960> in

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
make sure that this tube roller is in

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.950 
make sure that this tube roller is in
the<00:01:40.439> up<00:01:40.650> position<00:01:41.000> this<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.180> before<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.689> prime

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
the up position this is before you prime

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.620 
the up position this is before you prime
the<00:01:43.140> system<00:01:43.549> otherwise<00:01:44.549> knowing<00:01:45.030> come<00:01:45.420> down

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
the system otherwise knowing come down

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.990 
the system otherwise knowing come down
the<00:01:45.780> line<00:01:45.960> so<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.310> when<00:01:47.460> you're<00:01:47.610> using<00:01:47.759> the

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
the line so and when you're using the

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.429 
the line so and when you're using the
printer<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.420> should<00:01:48.600> always<00:01:48.750> be<00:01:48.899> in<00:01:49.140> as<00:01:49.290> your

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
printer it should always be in as your

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.469 
printer it should always be in as your
or<00:01:49.590> position<00:01:50.070> there's<00:01:50.700> no<00:01:50.850> need<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.090> close

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
or position there's no need to close

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.810 
or position there's no need to close
this<00:01:51.689> at<00:01:51.899> all<00:01:52.110> so<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.009> air<00:01:53.130> filters<00:01:53.549> are<00:01:53.579> now

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
this at all so the air filters are now

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.959 
this at all so the air filters are now
installed<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.780> can<00:01:54.930> be<00:01:55.049> sat<00:01:55.430> on<00:01:56.430> the

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
installed and it can be sat on the

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.850 
installed and it can be sat on the
left-hand<00:01:57.390> side<00:01:57.450> of<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.840> printer<00:01:58.200> neatly

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
left-hand side of the printer neatly

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.670 
left-hand side of the printer neatly
like<00:01:59.250> site<00:01:59.640> so<00:02:00.390> we<00:02:00.540> can<00:02:00.570> anything<00:02:01.290> with

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
like site so we can anything with

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.470 
like site so we can anything with
what<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.920> do<00:02:02.040> now<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:02.520> that<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.970> printer<00:02:03.330> knows

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:03.480 
what to do now is that the printer knows

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.010 
what to do now is that the printer knows
that<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.960> lid<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.920> open<00:02:05.580> and<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.480> will<00:02:06.600> refuse

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
that the lid is open and it will refuse

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.490 
that the lid is open and it will refuse
to<00:02:07.200> print<00:02:07.490> so<00:02:08.490> in<00:02:08.759> this<00:02:08.910> area<00:02:09.179> here<00:02:09.780> there<00:02:10.320> is<00:02:10.470> a

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
to print so in this area here there is a

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.220 
to print so in this area here there is a
small<00:02:10.740> a<00:02:11.100> very<00:02:11.310> small<00:02:11.490> sensor<00:02:12.330> so<00:02:12.930> with<00:02:13.110> the

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.810 
small a very small sensor so with the
spare<00:02:13.500> plug<00:02:13.800> that<00:02:14.010> we<00:02:14.100> took<00:02:14.310> out<00:02:14.520> we're<00:02:14.730> going

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
spare plug that we took out we're going

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.400 
spare plug that we took out we're going
to<00:02:14.880> put<00:02:15.120> it<00:02:15.210> in<00:02:15.360> on<00:02:15.630> that<00:02:15.810> sensor<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.380> you

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
to put it in on that sensor and you

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.160 
to put it in on that sensor and you
should<00:02:16.680> see<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.100> light<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:17.520> go<00:02:17.670> out<00:02:18.080> there<00:02:19.080> we

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
should see the light to go out there we

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.530 
should see the light to go out there we
are<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:20.100> the<00:02:20.190> printer<00:02:20.550> now<00:02:20.580> thinks<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.209> lid<00:02:21.390> is

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
are to the printer now thinks the lid is

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.370 
are to the printer now thinks the lid is
shot<00:02:22.250> and<00:02:23.250> we<00:02:23.370> can<00:02:23.400> actually<00:02:24.020> close<00:02:25.020> the

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
shot and we can actually close the

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.740 
shot and we can actually close the
layers<00:02:25.590> though<00:02:25.860> those<00:02:26.070> as<00:02:26.370> far<00:02:26.640> as<00:02:26.970> it's<00:02:27.420> going

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
layers though those as far as it's going

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.710 
layers though those as far as it's going
to<00:02:28.080> go<00:02:28.230> on<00:02:28.260> this<00:02:28.650> machine<00:02:28.920> because<00:02:29.910> it<00:02:30.060> is

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
to go on this machine because it is

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.780 
to go on this machine because it is
actually<00:02:30.900> touching<00:02:31.740> to<00:02:32.070> touching<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.520> clamp

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
actually touching to touching the clamp

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.160 
actually touching to touching the clamp
so<00:02:32.970> that's<00:02:33.150> as<00:02:33.300> far<00:02:33.330> as<00:02:33.630> you're<00:02:33.750> going<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:34.020> get

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
so that's as far as you're going to get

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.110 
so that's as far as you're going to get
it

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120
