in the middle it's a really nice one
though<00:02:40.360> most<00:02:41.360> people<00:02:41.420> don't<00:02:41.690> like<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:41.959> metal

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
though most people don't like the metal

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.410 
though most people don't like the metal
packed<00:02:42.380> if<00:02:42.560> that<00:02:42.860> feels<00:02:43.310> more<00:02:43.549> cheap<00:02:43.849> but

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
packed if that feels more cheap but

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.509 
packed if that feels more cheap but
usually<00:02:45.380> the<00:02:45.530> design<00:02:45.829> isn't<00:02:46.040> very<00:02:46.280> good<00:02:46.459> but

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
usually the design isn't very good but

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.789 
usually the design isn't very good but
the<00:02:46.790> I've<00:02:47.299> heard<00:02:47.480> people<00:02:47.959> say<00:02:48.260> they<00:02:48.440> like<00:02:48.470> the

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
the I've heard people say they like the

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:50.620 
the I've heard people say they like the
design<00:02:49.069> of<00:02:49.130> this<00:02:49.370> they<00:02:49.819> just<00:02:50.030> don't<00:02:50.209> like<00:02:50.390> the

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
design of this they just don't like the

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.229 
design of this they just don't like the
spine<00:02:51.340> because<00:02:52.340> usually<00:02:52.489> it<00:02:52.760> says<00:02:52.910> the<00:02:53.060> game

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
spine because usually it says the game

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.140 
spine because usually it says the game
name<00:02:53.510> looks<00:02:53.810> a<00:02:53.900> lot<00:02:54.019> better<00:02:54.200> I<00:02:54.940> hold<00:02:55.940> on<00:02:56.060> an

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
name looks a lot better I hold on an

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.300 
name looks a lot better I hold on an
open<00:02:56.299> this<00:02:56.510> off-camera<00:02:56.720> yep<00:02:57.590> because<00:02:58.130> they

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
open this off-camera yep because they

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.870 
open this off-camera yep because they
always<00:02:58.489> like<00:02:58.730> to<00:02:59.950> point<00:03:00.950> the<00:03:01.130> codes<00:03:01.400> out<00:03:01.670> on

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
always like to point the codes out on

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.729 
always like to point the codes out on
accident<00:03:02.389> ok<00:03:03.049> so<00:03:05.079> so<00:03:06.079> when<00:03:06.230> you<00:03:06.290> open<00:03:06.530> it<00:03:06.590> up

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
accident ok so so when you open it up

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:09.069 
accident ok so so when you open it up
this<00:03:07.310> is<00:03:07.430> what<00:03:07.549> you<00:03:07.670> get<00:03:07.880> now<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:08.810> disc

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
scorpion skin which is very odd because

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.750

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.620 
collective Cold War scorpion skin I
didn't<00:04:29.730> know<00:04:29.790> about<00:04:29.910> this<00:04:30.180> that's<00:04:30.419> pretty

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
didn't know about this that's pretty

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.830 
didn't know about this that's pretty
cool<00:04:31.280> so<00:04:32.280> that's<00:04:32.430> unique<00:04:32.760> but<00:04:33.480> again<00:04:33.690> these

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
cool so that's unique but again these

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.320 
cool so that's unique but again these
codes<00:04:34.200> will<00:04:34.410> only<00:04:34.590> work<00:04:34.889> on<00:04:35.100> well<00:04:35.970> it'll<00:04:36.150> work

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
codes will only work on well it'll work

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.550 
codes will only work on well it'll work
for<00:04:36.479> this<00:04:36.570> game<00:04:36.750> even<00:04:36.810> if<00:04:37.110> you<00:04:37.200> have<00:04:37.320> a<00:04:37.350> North

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
for this game even if you have a North

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.409 
for this game even if you have a North
American<00:04:37.919> account<00:04:38.190> I<00:04:38.370> think<00:04:38.580> no<00:04:39.150> I<00:04:39.180> think

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
American account I think no I think

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:40.820 
American account I think no I think
you'd<00:04:39.540> have<00:04:39.660> to<00:04:39.750> have<00:04:39.840> a<00:04:39.870> European<00:04:40.650> take<00:04:40.740> out

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
you'd have to have a European take out

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.159 
you'd have to have a European take out
to<00:04:40.950> even<00:04:41.190> redeem<00:04:41.700> these<00:04:41.970> but<00:04:42.270> it's<00:04:42.810> fairly

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
to even redeem these but it's fairly

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:45.530 
to even redeem these but it's fairly
easy<00:04:43.320> to<00:04:43.530> make<00:04:43.740> an<00:04:43.860> European<00:04:44.250> account<00:04:44.540> just

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
easy to make an European account just

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:46.969 
easy to make an European account just

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
that way you anytime you get a European

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.100 
that way you anytime you get a European
game<00:04:51.990> you<00:04:52.740> can<00:04:53.300> redeem<00:04:54.300> the<00:04:54.479> codes<00:04:54.720> and<00:04:54.990> use

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
game you can redeem the codes and use

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.530 
game you can redeem the codes and use
the<00:04:55.260> codes<00:04:55.500> okay<00:04:56.310> so<00:04:56.370> the<00:04:56.729> next<00:04:56.760> thing<00:04:57.030> here<00:04:57.389> is

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
the codes okay so the next thing here is

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:04.940 
the codes okay so the next thing here is
the<00:04:59.389> comic<00:05:00.979> so<00:05:01.979> this<00:05:02.130> is<00:05:02.160> pretty<00:05:02.400> cool<00:05:02.520> I<00:05:03.950> think

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
the comic so this is pretty cool I think

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.610 
the comic so this is pretty cool I think
it's<00:05:05.070> like<00:05:05.220> a<00:05:05.630> prequel<00:05:06.630> to<00:05:06.810> the<00:05:06.930> story<00:05:07.200> or<00:05:07.530> at

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
it's like a prequel to the story or at

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.190 
it's like a prequel to the story or at
least<00:05:07.770> showing<00:05:07.979> you<00:05:08.160> like<00:05:08.340> what's<00:05:08.550> happened

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
least showing you like what's happened

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
least showing you like what's happened

between MK 9 and then 10 so the so the

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.000 
between MK 9 and then 10 so the so the
events<00:05:14.640> kind<00:05:14.850> of<00:05:14.940> leading<00:05:15.150> up<00:05:15.740> to<00:05:16.740> the<00:05:16.860> new

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.960 
off no but you can see where they that
it<00:06:27.630> was<00:06:27.870> a<00:06:27.900> two<00:06:28.230> piece<00:06:28.520> hold<00:06:29.520> on<00:06:29.610> and<00:06:29.730> see<00:06:29.820> if<00:06:29.910> I

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:29.970 
it was a two piece hold on and see if I

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.030 
it was a two piece hold on and see if I
can<00:06:30.150> see<00:06:30.870> how<00:06:30.990> it<00:06:31.140> was<00:06:31.230> a<00:06:31.260> two<00:06:31.530> piece<00:06:31.740> and<00:06:31.770> they

can see how it was a two piece and they

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.670 
can see how it was a two piece and they
they<00:06:32.850> shoved<00:06:33.570> it<00:06:33.660> down<00:06:33.690> in<00:06:34.020> there<00:06:34.140> themselves

they shoved it down in there themselves
and<00:06:34.770> then<00:06:34.860> probably<00:06:35.040> glued<00:06:35.400> it<00:06:35.550> and<00:06:35.760> it

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:36.750 
and then probably glued it and it

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.710 
and then probably glued it and it
wobbles<00:06:37.230> a<00:06:37.320> little<00:06:37.530> bit<00:06:37.680> scorpion<00:06:38.720> scorpion

I I guess I really don't like either of
the<00:06:48.060> statues<00:06:48.480> really<00:06:48.780> to<00:06:49.500> be<00:06:49.830> honest<00:06:50.070> i'd<00:06:50.190> say

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:50.310 
the statues really to be honest i'd say

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:51.530 
the statues really to be honest i'd say
the<00:06:50.460> course<00:06:50.700> one<00:06:50.880> is<00:06:50.910> actually<00:06:51.360> higher

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:51.540 
the course one is actually higher
