you're<00:00:00.539> about<00:00:00.690> to<00:00:00.840> get<00:00:00.960> the<00:00:01.020> monster<00:00:01.639> the

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
you're about to get the monster the

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.070 
you're about to get the monster the
monster<00:00:02.669> is<00:00:03.120> a<00:00:03.149> presentation<00:00:03.600> that<00:00:03.780> is<00:00:03.929> so

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
monster is a presentation that is so

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.720 
monster is a presentation that is so
lengthy<00:00:04.470> that<00:00:04.890> it<00:00:04.950> would<00:00:05.040> be<00:00:05.130> impossible<00:00:05.370> in

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
lengthy that it would be impossible in

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.130 
lengthy that it would be impossible in
my<00:00:05.819> humble<00:00:05.970> assessment<00:00:06.509> for<00:00:06.660> any<00:00:06.779> reasonable

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
my humble assessment for any reasonable

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.870 
my humble assessment for any reasonable
human<00:00:07.529> to<00:00:07.830> try<00:00:07.950> to<00:00:08.040> present<00:00:08.340> all<00:00:08.460> these<00:00:08.580> slides

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
human to try to present all these slides

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.669 
human to try to present all these slides
in<00:00:09.120> for<00:00:09.300> example<00:00:09.630> 50<00:00:09.900> plus<00:00:10.050> or<00:00:10.200> minus<00:00:10.410> minutes

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
in for example 50 plus or minus minutes

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.160 
in for example 50 plus or minus minutes
so<00:00:10.830> what<00:00:11.280> I'm<00:00:11.400> going<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:11.670> do<00:00:11.849> because<00:00:12.809> my<00:00:12.960> goal

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
so what I'm going to do because my goal

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.900 
so what I'm going to do because my goal
in<00:00:13.469> putting<00:00:13.679> this<00:00:13.769> together<00:00:13.920> was<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:14.610> try<00:00:14.849> to

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
in putting this together was to try to

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.760 
in putting this together was to try to
give<00:00:15.179> you<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.360> resource<00:00:15.780> that<00:00:15.990> perhaps<00:00:16.410> you

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
give you a resource that perhaps you

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.050 
give you a resource that perhaps you
hadn't<00:00:17.039> been<00:00:17.190> exposed<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.670> ever<00:00:17.789> before

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
hadn't been exposed to ever before

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.400 
hadn't been exposed to ever before
because<00:00:18.660> perhaps<00:00:19.080> your<00:00:19.260> day-to-day

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
because perhaps your day-to-day

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.650 
because perhaps your day-to-day
endeavors<00:00:19.980> don't<00:00:20.640> allow<00:00:20.760> you<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.970> look<00:00:21.119> at<00:00:21.300> the

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
endeavors don't allow you to look at the

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.880 
endeavors don't allow you to look at the
peer-reviewed<00:00:22.050> database<00:00:22.380> science<00:00:22.769> that

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
peer-reviewed database science that

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.710 
peer-reviewed database science that
might<00:00:23.010> be<00:00:23.130> specific<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.640> our<00:00:23.670> field<00:00:23.970> whereas

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
might be specific to our field whereas

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.580 
might be specific to our field whereas
that's<00:00:24.900> what<00:00:25.019> I<00:00:25.050> do<00:00:25.140> in<00:00:25.260> my<00:00:25.439> day-to-day

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
that's what I do in my day-to-day

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.589 
that's what I do in my day-to-day
teaching<00:00:26.130> as<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.609> Community<00:00:26.939> College<00:00:27.150> member<00:00:27.420> I

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
teaching as a Community College member I

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.230 
teaching as a Community College member I
teach<00:00:27.960> exercise<00:00:28.380> physiology<00:00:29.240> human

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240

performance<00:00:30.480> courses<00:00:31.080> like<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.380> so<00:00:31.619> really

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
performance courses like that so really

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.459 
performance courses like that so really
it's<00:00:32.250> part<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.669> what<00:00:32.880> I<00:00:32.910> do<00:00:33.050> almost<00:00:34.050> every

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
it's part of what I do almost every

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.979 
it's part of what I do almost every
second<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:35.010> every<00:00:35.190> day<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.550> being<00:00:36.059> said<00:00:36.270> what

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
second of every day that being said what

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.240 
second of every day that being said what
I'll<00:00:37.110> do<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.260> think<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:37.739> simply<00:00:38.040> picked

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
I'll do I think is simply picked

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.069 
I'll do I think is simply picked
selectively<00:00:38.670> from<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.450> 8<00:00:39.660> or<00:00:39.780> 9<00:00:39.899> different

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
selectively from the 8 or 9 different

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.200 
selectively from the 8 or 9 different
categories<00:00:40.770> I'll<00:00:41.370> pick<00:00:41.520> selectively<00:00:41.969> and

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
categories I'll pick selectively and

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.209 
categories I'll pick selectively and
show<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.480> some<00:00:42.750> current<00:00:43.050> science<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.649> just

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
show you some current science and just

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.069 
show you some current science and just
allow<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.969> assess<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.719> maybe<00:00:45.930> we<00:00:45.989> can

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
allow you to assess it and maybe we can

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.869 
allow you to assess it and maybe we can
interact<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.590> little<00:00:46.980> less<00:00:47.190> formally<00:00:47.550> outside

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
interact a little less formally outside

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.400 
interact a little less formally outside
of<00:00:47.969> here<00:00:48.059> when<00:00:48.180> we're<00:00:48.300> done<00:00:48.390> but<00:00:49.200> there<00:00:49.320> are<00:00:49.379> a

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
of here when we're done but there are a

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.660 
of here when we're done but there are a
lot<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:49.530> areas<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.160> think<00:00:50.250> you'll<00:00:50.489> find

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
lot of areas that I think you'll find

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.459 
lot of areas that I think you'll find
relatively<00:00:51.390> compelling<00:00:51.870> I'm<00:00:52.079> not<00:00:52.260> going<00:00:52.410> to

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
relatively compelling I'm not going to

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.720 
relatively compelling I'm not going to
talk<00:00:52.559> about<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.920> training<00:00:53.100> philosophy<00:00:53.309> that

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
talk about the training philosophy that

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.760 
talk about the training philosophy that
we<00:00:53.789> use<00:00:53.910> at<00:00:54.030> Desert<00:00:54.300> Vista<00:00:54.390> or<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.590> used

we use at Desert Vista or that I used

it's<00:00:55.920> Avery<00:00:56.100> College<00:00:56.399> Prep<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.149> really

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
it's Avery College Prep this is really

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.979 
it's Avery College Prep this is really

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
performance which is what we're

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.080 
performance which is what we're
interested<00:01:04.739> in<00:01:04.799> yes<00:01:05.010> this<00:01:05.790> has<00:01:05.880> been<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.000> really

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
interested in yes this has been a really

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.250 
interested in yes this has been a really
interesting<00:01:06.270> topic<00:01:06.720> for<00:01:06.750> me<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.020> I'll<00:01:07.080> try<00:01:07.229> to

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
interesting topic for me and I'll try to

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.550 
interesting topic for me and I'll try to
be<00:01:07.380> brief<00:01:07.680> because<00:01:08.930> when<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.049> conversation

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
be brief because when this conversation

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.380 
be brief because when this conversation
started<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.340> think<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.700> would<00:01:11.850> argue<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.119> started

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
started I think I would argue it started

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.960 
started I think I would argue it started
in<00:01:12.450> 2004<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.290> would<00:01:13.740> make<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.010> argument<00:01:14.159> based

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
in 2004 I would make that argument based

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.190 
in 2004 I would make that argument based
on<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.150> paper<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.450> came<00:01:15.509> out<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.810> university

colleagues put out this paper and it was
the<00:01:20.189> basis<00:01:20.520> for<00:01:20.549> many<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:20.939> these<00:01:21.000> claims<00:01:21.240> that

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
the basis for many of these claims that

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.810 
the basis for many of these claims that

stretching impairs muscle function what

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.380 
stretching impairs muscle function what

was not widely publicized I thought
