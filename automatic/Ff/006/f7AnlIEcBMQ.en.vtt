what was inside it now some of you said
graphics<00:00:19.670> go<00:00:19.820> with<00:00:20.300> the<00:00:20.480> aaos<00:00:20.900> pretty<00:00:21.170> obvious

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
graphics go with the aaos pretty obvious

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.460 
graphics go with the aaos pretty obvious
because<00:00:21.710> the<00:00:21.920> hitch<00:00:22.070> is<00:00:22.390> box<00:00:23.390> so<00:00:23.660> that's<00:00:23.930> they

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
because the hitch is box so that's they

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.259 
because the hitch is box so that's they
make<00:00:24.650> graphics<00:00:24.859> cards<00:00:25.340> I<00:00:25.520> want<00:00:25.850> you<00:00:25.939> to<00:00:26.060> guess

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:26.269 
make graphics cards I want you to guess

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.080 
make graphics cards I want you to guess
the<00:00:26.630> year<00:00:26.930> the<00:00:27.109> product<00:00:27.580> you<00:00:28.580> know<00:00:28.699> what<00:00:28.939> was

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
the year the product you know what was

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.560 
the year the product you know what was
inside<00:00:29.240> and<00:00:29.810> for<00:00:30.500> me<00:00:30.590> like<00:00:30.769> same<00:00:30.980> is<00:00:31.099> no

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
inside and for me like same is no

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.640 
inside and for me like same is no
information<00:00:32.570> like<00:00:32.989> tissues<00:00:33.230> to<00:00:33.350> play<00:00:33.530> in

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:33.650 
information like tissues to play in

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.229 
information like tissues to play in
black<00:00:33.830> box<00:00:34.040> and<00:00:34.280> I'm<00:00:34.489> guessing<00:00:34.970> this<00:00:35.030> is<00:00:35.210> the

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
black box and I'm guessing this is the

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.720 
black box and I'm guessing this is the
inner<00:00:36.050> packaging<00:00:36.620> because<00:00:37.070> it<00:00:37.340> is<00:00:37.460> a<00:00:37.489> press

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
inner packaging because it is a press

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.450 
inner packaging because it is a press
sample<00:00:38.180> them<00:00:38.420> when<00:00:39.350> the<00:00:39.469> retail<00:00:39.829> versions<00:00:40.280> do

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
sample them when the retail versions do

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.400 
sample them when the retail versions do
go<00:00:40.670> out<00:00:40.790> and<00:00:41.390> it<00:00:41.540> will<00:00:41.660> have<00:00:41.780> the<00:00:41.960> the<00:00:42.260> outer

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
go out and it will have the the outer

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.139 
go out and it will have the the outer
packaging<00:00:42.980> with<00:00:43.100> all<00:00:43.190> the<00:00:43.340> information<00:00:43.579> and

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
packaging with all the information and

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:45.850 
packaging with all the information and

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.470 
usually you get everything to the box
inside<00:00:46.280> if<00:00:46.520> you've<00:00:46.700> bought<00:00:47.059> a<00:00:47.090> graphics<00:00:47.450> card

inside if you've bought a graphics card

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.510 
inside if you've bought a graphics card
before<00:00:47.780> you'll<00:00:48.110> know<00:00:48.260> what<00:00:48.350> I<00:00:48.379> mean<00:00:48.530> and<00:00:49.250> so

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 
series came out a few weeks ago now and

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:52.359 
series came out a few weeks ago now and
there<00:01:50.689> is<00:01:50.720> different<00:01:51.110> models<00:01:51.439> and<00:01:52.009> but<00:01:52.189> most

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
there is different models and but most

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.550 
there is different models and but most
of<00:01:52.430> them<00:01:52.490> did<00:01:52.820> it<00:01:52.850> come<00:01:53.180> with<00:01:53.420> a<00:01:53.659> a<00:01:53.869> shroud<00:01:54.290> like

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
of them did it come with a a shroud like

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.710 
of them did it come with a a shroud like
this<00:01:54.710> one<00:01:54.950> house<00:01:55.130> and<00:01:55.399> but<00:01:56.180> this<00:01:56.329> one's<00:01:56.540> got

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
this one house and but this one's got

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.010 
this one house and but this one's got
the<00:01:56.780> the<00:01:57.110> shroud<00:01:57.439> or<00:01:57.799> see<00:01:58.070> the<00:01:58.479> hit<00:01:59.479> a<00:01:59.630> cooler

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
the the shroud or see the hit a cooler

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.300 
the the shroud or see the hit a cooler
on<00:02:00.170> there<00:02:00.320> because<00:02:00.439> this<00:02:00.649> is<00:02:00.770> slightly<00:02:01.040> over

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
on there because this is slightly over

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.130 
on there because this is slightly over

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
it's a budget entry card how that would

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.500 
it's a budget entry card how that would
befall<00:02:37.049> over<00:02:37.290> three<00:02:37.500> monitors<00:02:37.769> in<00:02:38.040> gaming<00:02:38.510> but

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
befall over three monitors in gaming but

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.670 
befall over three monitors in gaming but
you<00:02:39.569> do<00:02:39.720> on<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:39.959> back<00:02:40.140> I've<00:02:40.379> got<00:02:40.530> obviously

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
you do on the back I've got obviously

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.059 
you do on the back I've got obviously
the<00:02:41.010> outer<00:02:41.160> parts<00:02:41.610> for<00:02:41.790> dual<00:02:42.420> DVI<00:02:42.860> hdmi<00:02:43.860> and

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
the outer parts for dual DVI hdmi and

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.270 
the outer parts for dual DVI hdmi and
displayport<00:02:44.310> so<00:02:45.030> you<00:02:45.120> can<00:02:45.299> have<00:02:45.390> a<00:02:45.450> multi<00:02:45.720> card

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
displayport so you can have a multi card

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.360 
displayport so you can have a multi card
multi-monitor<00:02:47.280> setup<00:02:47.879> and<00:02:48.330> with<00:02:48.720> this

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
multi-monitor setup and with this

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.740 
multi-monitor setup and with this
crossfire<00:02:50.370> character<00:02:50.790> as<00:02:50.910> well<00:02:51.090> so<00:02:51.569> you<00:02:51.660> can

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
crossfire character as well so you can

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.750 
crossfire character as well so you can
obviously<00:02:52.170> pair<00:02:52.680> two<00:02:52.890> of<00:02:52.980> these<00:02:53.099> up<00:02:53.310> that<00:02:53.610> will

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
obviously pair two of these up that will

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.890 
obviously pair two of these up that will
improve<00:02:54.060> your<00:02:54.290> graphics<00:02:55.290> performance<00:02:55.579> on<00:02:56.579> the

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
improve your graphics performance on the

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.089 
improve your graphics performance on the
back<00:02:57.900> there<00:02:58.200> you<00:02:58.410> can<00:02:58.590> see<00:02:58.620> you've<00:02:58.920> got<00:02:58.980> a

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
back there you can see you've got a

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.750 
back there you can see you've got a
single<00:02:59.459> six<00:02:59.849> pin<00:03:00.150> and<00:03:00.829> PCI<00:03:01.829> Express<00:03:02.069> power

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
single six pin and PCI Express power

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.369 
single six pin and PCI Express power
connector<00:03:03.360> so<00:03:03.510> it's<00:03:03.599> not<00:03:03.780> gonna<00:03:03.989> use<00:03:04.110> loads

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 
connector so it's not gonna use loads

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:06.920 
connector so it's not gonna use loads
and<00:03:04.620> loads<00:03:04.680> of<00:03:04.920> power<00:03:05.239> and<00:03:06.239> you<00:03:06.540> look<00:03:06.690> nice

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
and loads of power and you look nice

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.199 
and loads of power and you look nice

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
something like 60 overclocked slightly

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.710

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.690 
and quick look at the bottom you can see
the<00:03:51.450> PCB<00:03:51.959> it's<00:03:52.410> kind<00:03:52.590> of<00:03:52.650> a<00:03:52.739> greenie<00:03:53.130> tick<00:03:53.519> or

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
the PCB it's kind of a greenie tick or

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
or the really dark brown which is

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.089 
or the really dark brown which is
probably<00:04:06.480> better<00:04:06.840> kiss<00:04:07.139> my<00:04:07.319> stealth<00:04:07.680> looking

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
probably better kiss my stealth looking

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:12.050 
probably better kiss my stealth looking
and<00:04:08.630> i<00:04:09.630> don't<00:04:10.019> know<00:04:10.109> why<00:04:10.380> the<00:04:10.579> the<00:04:11.579> opt<00:04:11.760> for<00:04:12.030> the

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
and i don't know why the the opt for the

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.240 
and i don't know why the the opt for the
this<00:04:12.450> color<00:04:12.690> but<00:04:12.900> a<00:04:13.079> lot<00:04:13.470> of<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.650> delorean

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
this color but a lot of the delorean

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.279 
this color but a lot of the delorean
motherboards<00:04:14.790> i<00:04:14.970> use<00:04:15.359> a<00:04:15.389> similar<00:04:15.720> color<00:04:16.019> as

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
motherboards i use a similar color as

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.800 
motherboards i use a similar color as
well<00:04:16.320> so<00:04:16.739> I<00:04:16.769> think<00:04:17.070> it's<00:04:17.310> just<00:04:17.400> may<00:04:18.299> be<00:04:18.359> cheaper

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
well so I think it's just may be cheaper

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.500 
well so I think it's just may be cheaper
to<00:04:18.840> manufacture<00:04:19.169> I<00:04:19.500> don't<00:04:19.799> know<00:04:19.919> but<00:04:20.510> if

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
to manufacture I don't know but if

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.260 
to manufacture I don't know but if
you've<00:04:21.750> got<00:04:22.019> this<00:04:22.109> inside<00:04:22.440> a<00:04:22.470> case<00:04:22.800> and<00:04:23.270> you're

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
you've got this inside a case and you're

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.279 
you've got this inside a case and you're
not<00:04:24.360> going<00:04:24.570> to<00:04:24.630> be<00:04:24.690> looking<00:04:24.870> at<00:04:24.990> you're<00:04:25.229> not

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
not going to be looking at you're not

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:25.610 
not going to be looking at you're not
going<00:04:25.469> to

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
going to

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.469 
going to
see<00:04:25.710> anyway<00:04:26.130> so<00:04:26.190> it<00:04:26.580> isn't<00:04:27.210> going<00:04:27.300> to<00:04:27.389> make

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
see anyway so it isn't going to make

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:29.540 
see anyway so it isn't going to make
that<00:04:27.660> much<00:04:27.840> difference<00:04:28.070> you've<00:04:29.070> got<00:04:29.220> obvious

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
that much difference you've got obvious

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:30.620 
that much difference you've got obvious
on<00:04:29.639> the<00:04:29.729> back<00:04:29.910> as<00:04:30.060> well<00:04:30.090> some<00:04:30.389> extra

ventilation there to help exhaust that

ventilation there to help exhaust that
warm<00:04:32.940> air<00:04:34.669> this<00:04:35.669> one<00:04:35.940> the<00:04:36.360> server<00:04:36.900> 790<00:04:37.410> see<00:04:37.560> is

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
warm air this one the server 790 see is

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.140 
warm air this one the server 790 see is
a<00:04:37.770> press<00:04:37.949> around<00:04:38.220> the<00:04:38.370> belt<00:04:38.580> summer<00:04:39.060> just

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
a press around the belt summer just

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.610 
a press around the belt summer just
under<00:04:39.479> hundred<00:04:39.750> pounds<00:04:40.169> something<00:04:40.440> a<00:04:40.500> little

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
under hundred pounds something a little

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.120 
under hundred pounds something a little
bit<00:04:40.800> more<00:04:40.979> this<00:04:41.220> 105<00:04:42.210> pounds<00:04:42.570> and<00:04:43.410> it<00:04:43.860> does

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
bit more this 105 pounds and it does

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.760 
bit more this 105 pounds and it does
like<00:04:44.310> say<00:04:44.520> this<00:04:44.790> one<00:04:44.970> comes<00:04:45.180> with<00:04:45.270> the<00:04:45.770> free

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
like say this one comes with the free

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.620 
like say this one comes with the free
copy<00:04:47.040> of<00:04:47.130> bioshock<00:04:47.370> so<00:04:47.940> she<00:04:50.090> say<00:04:51.090> the<00:04:51.270> battery

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
copy of bioshock so she say the battery

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.050 
copy of bioshock so she say the battery
up<00:04:51.690> getting<00:04:51.930> was<00:04:52.020> costia<00:04:52.320> 30<00:04:52.650> 40<00:04:53.010> pounds<00:04:53.340> then

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
up getting was costia 30 40 pounds then

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.000 
up getting was costia 30 40 pounds then
it's<00:04:54.210> not<00:04:54.330> bad<00:04:54.570> not<00:04:55.080> bad<00:04:55.110> deal<00:04:55.500> with<00:04:55.680> the<00:04:55.770> card

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
it's not bad not bad deal with the card

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.279 
it's not bad not bad deal with the card
itself<00:04:56.190> so<00:04:56.699> look<00:04:57.479> around<00:04:57.750> on<00:04:57.900> the<00:04:57.990> internet

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289
