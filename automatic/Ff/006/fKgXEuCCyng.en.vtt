looked very very good he does have a

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.569 
looked very very good he does have a
history<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.479> inconsistency<00:01:58.350> though<00:01:58.860> but<00:01:59.399> if

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
history of inconsistency though but if

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:00.800 
history of inconsistency though but if
we<00:01:59.700> know<00:01:59.880> for<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.090> fact<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:00.360> all<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.659> going<00:02:00.780> to

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
we know for a fact that all is going to

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.300 
we know for a fact that all is going to
have<00:02:00.930> another<00:02:01.229> good<00:02:01.439> game<00:02:01.619> like<00:02:01.860> he<00:02:01.979> had<00:02:02.100> last

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
have another good game like he had last

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.980 
have another good game like he had last
week<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.820> definitely<00:02:03.360> Cincinnati<00:02:03.840> would

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
week and definitely Cincinnati would

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.929 
week and definitely Cincinnati would
probably<00:02:04.350> be<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.590> plant-<00:02:04.979> five<00:02:05.369> another

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
probably be the plant- five another

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.089 
probably be the plant- five another
factor<00:02:06.299> though<00:02:06.450> is<00:02:06.630> key<00:02:07.290> injuries<00:02:07.649> on<00:02:07.950> defense

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
factor though is key injuries on defense

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.070 
factor though is key injuries on defense
for<00:02:08.640> Cincinnati<00:02:09.119> there<00:02:09.300> Cincinnati<00:02:09.780> their

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
for Cincinnati there Cincinnati their

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.360 
for Cincinnati there Cincinnati their
their<00:02:10.349> defense<00:02:10.679> is<00:02:10.770> supposed<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.099> be<00:02:11.160> is

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
their defense is supposed to be is

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.130 
their defense is supposed to be is
looking<00:02:11.610> pretty<00:02:11.760> good<00:02:11.970> this<00:02:12.120> year<00:02:12.180> but<00:02:12.870> made

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
looking pretty good this year but made

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.290 
looking pretty good this year but made
with<00:02:13.290> those<00:02:13.410> injuries<00:02:13.890> it'll<00:02:14.280> take<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.000> step

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
with those injuries it'll take a step

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.090 
with those injuries it'll take a step
down<00:02:15.480> so<00:02:15.810> I<00:02:15.840> don't<00:02:16.440> know<00:02:16.500> what<00:02:16.800> do<00:02:16.860> you<00:02:16.920> think

for<00:04:15.480> the<00:04:15.540> Bengals<00:04:15.930> I<00:04:16.079> look<00:04:16.829> for<00:04:17.100> them<00:04:17.190> to<00:04:17.370> at

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
for the Bengals I look for them to at

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.210 
for the Bengals I look for them to at
least<00:04:17.729> cover<00:04:18.120> the<00:04:18.239> five<00:04:18.539> points<00:04:19.079> I<00:04:19.260> would<00:04:19.829> say

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
least cover the five points I would say

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.700 
least cover the five points I would say
it's<00:04:20.669> a<00:04:21.120> pretty<00:04:21.390> solid<00:04:21.690> bet<00:04:22.080> all<00:04:22.470> right<00:04:22.590> but

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
it's a pretty solid bet all right but

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.830 
it's a pretty solid bet all right but
the<00:04:22.800> key<00:04:22.950> is<00:04:23.190> is<00:04:23.580> the<00:04:23.760> consistency<00:04:24.240> of<00:04:24.390> Andy

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
the key is is the consistency of Andy

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:25.650 
the key is is the consistency of Andy
Dalton<00:04:25.200> you<00:04:25.320> know

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.180 
Dalton you know
that's<00:04:25.750> what<00:04:25.900> makes<00:04:26.110> him<00:04:26.260> so<00:04:26.470> it<00:04:26.770> just<00:04:27.070> makes

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
that's what makes him so it just makes

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.070 
that's what makes him so it just makes
you<00:04:27.280> so<00:04:27.370> nervous<00:04:27.580> to<00:04:27.790> bet<00:04:28.030> on<00:04:28.180> a<00:04:28.210> team<00:04:28.480> led<00:04:28.930> by

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
you so nervous to bet on a team led by

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.110 
you so nervous to bet on a team led by
an<00:04:29.260> adult<00:04:29.500> least<00:04:29.830> historically<00:04:29.980> when<00:04:30.910> he's<00:04:31.090> a

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
an adult least historically when he's a

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.820 
an adult least historically when he's a
favorite<00:04:31.420> but<00:04:31.780> that's<00:04:32.290> okay<00:04:32.530> with<00:04:32.650> you<00:04:32.740> you

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
favorite but that's okay with you you

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:33.900 
favorite but that's okay with you you
think<00:04:32.980> he's<00:04:33.100> going<00:04:33.190> to<00:04:33.250> be<00:04:33.370> good<00:04:33.520> enough<00:04:33.700> here

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
think he's going to be good enough here

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.180 
think he's going to be good enough here
it's<00:04:34.330> not<00:04:34.510> so<00:04:34.810> much<00:04:34.870> Andy<00:04:35.320> Dalton<00:04:35.740> it's<00:04:35.950> the

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
it's not so much Andy Dalton it's the

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.370 
it's not so much Andy Dalton it's the
the<00:04:36.640> bangles<00:04:37.060> offensive<00:04:37.570> line<00:04:37.810> and<00:04:38.170> the

the bangles offensive line and the

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.290 
the bangles offensive line and the
