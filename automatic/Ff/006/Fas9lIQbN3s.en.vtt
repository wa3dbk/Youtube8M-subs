00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.710
 graphics card for more productive and 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:17.130
 you probably beam was such a situation 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.859
 like me that is and you bought a laptop and 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.680
 decided to launch someone powerful there 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:26.160
 a game that requires good good 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.279
 iron so to speak well you bought 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.840
 launched them you have a game and on very 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.960
 bad settings you think like this 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.380
 maybe I have a powerful video card all 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.300
 very simple i had this situation 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:42.390
 we go to the construction site drank tea on the chart and 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.230
 or properties of graphics no matter if y 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.050
 you are not in this two conclusion of this 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.289
 if you don't have something you need to find 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.180
 video card, that is , I, too, first 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.600
 there were no such 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.750
 rescued in the form of a more accurate graphics deadlines 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.059
 tame and graphics for this was not and 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.019
 I updated the video card on the official 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.830
 manufacturer's website 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.680
 I have ati radeon and I have appeared here 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.060
 these two features are properties of graphics 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.970
 as far as linen tea and graphics 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.180
 that I am allowed to cause a card and with 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.790
 comfort play such as battlefield 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:23.210
 assassin headlights edge and other good games 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.430
 which require powerful graphics cards 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:33.720
 go in with setting before tea and 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:37.619
 graphics as you can see we had 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:42.409
 is a window md catalyst control center 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:44.369
 for example you see extender here 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.979
 energy saving if you want 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.310
 some powerful game that is to 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:53.220
 found at the highest settings 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:59.790
 click add application worker 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:03.119
 table and for example choose battlefield 3 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:07.600
 click open and we have appeared 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:09.220
 inside advises and setting up graphics 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.380
 click here and high 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.690
 performance and on to image 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.520
 I do not recommend this 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.860
 for the game is to go big logs 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.600
 we put high performance then 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.140
 there is a game flew out at the maximum 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.020
 settings that is in the form of a map will be 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.590
 shrink the temple on the game to add to 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.959
 better graphics game i hope you 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.180
 helped in this if you repeat you 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.069
 There are no these two functions just update 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.920
