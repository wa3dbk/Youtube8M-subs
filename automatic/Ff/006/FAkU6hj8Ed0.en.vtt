to whose lawn looks the best so with all
that<00:00:40.170> in<00:00:40.440> mind<00:00:40.680> let's<00:00:41.250> get<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.610> it

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
that in mind let's get to it

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.529 
that in mind let's get to it
so<00:00:44.309> okay<00:00:44.550> here<00:00:44.700> we<00:00:44.789> go<00:00:44.820> down<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.390> first

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
so okay here we go down to the first

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.720 
so okay here we go down to the first
question<00:00:46.020> how<00:00:46.260> does<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.739> Eagle<00:00:47.250> power<00:00:47.430> mower

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
question how does the Eagle power mower

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.450 
question how does the Eagle power mower
cut<00:00:48.030> in<00:00:48.180> normal<00:00:49.110> conditions<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.250> answer

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
cut in normal conditions and the answer

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.330 
cut in normal conditions and the answer
is<00:00:50.640> surprisingly<00:00:51.420> well<00:00:51.809> I've<00:00:52.710> used<00:00:53.039> these

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
is surprisingly well I've used these

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.389 
is surprisingly well I've used these
cordless<00:00:53.940> electric<00:00:55.070> eco-friendly<00:00:56.070> mowers

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
cordless electric eco-friendly mowers

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.939 
cordless electric eco-friendly mowers
before<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.390> honestly<00:00:57.780> was<00:00:58.170> not<00:00:58.199> impressed

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
before and honestly was not impressed

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.369 
before and honestly was not impressed
but<00:00:59.219> this<00:00:59.489> one<00:00:59.760> I<00:00:59.969> would<00:01:00.570> say<00:01:00.750> it<00:01:00.930> does<00:01:01.109> perform

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
but this one I would say it does perform

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.950 
but this one I would say it does perform
very<00:01:02.100> much<00:01:02.370> similar<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.969> my<00:01:03.480> gas-powered

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
very much similar to my gas-powered

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.780 
very much similar to my gas-powered
model<00:01:04.409> only<00:01:04.559> difference<00:01:04.979> being<00:01:05.220> is<00:01:05.369> it's<00:01:05.580> not

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
model only difference being is it's not

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.690 
model only difference being is it's not
self-propelled<00:01:06.780> but<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:07.920> did<00:01:08.100> test<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.490> for

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
self-propelled but I did test it for

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.640 
self-propelled but I did test it for
several<00:01:08.939> weeks<00:01:09.119> here<00:01:09.450> with<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.810> bag<00:01:10.020> on<00:01:10.260> in

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
several weeks here with the bag on in

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.560 
several weeks here with the bag on in
the<00:01:10.830> bag<00:01:10.979> off<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.790> does<00:01:12.000> very<00:01:12.119> very<00:01:12.360> well

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
the bag off and it does very very well

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.719 
the bag off and it does very very well
it<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:12.990> very<00:01:13.380> lightweight<00:01:13.770> which<00:01:14.369> I<00:01:14.520> thought

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
it is very lightweight which I thought

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.910 
it is very lightweight which I thought
would<00:01:14.880> be<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.360> drawback<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.259> mower<00:01:16.439> because

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
would be a drawback to the mower because

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.039 
would be a drawback to the mower because
as<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.490> guys<00:01:17.759> probably<00:01:17.790> know<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.420> lightweight

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
as you guys probably know a lightweight

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.109 
as you guys probably know a lightweight
mower<00:01:19.350> will<00:01:19.710> tend<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.009> hop<00:01:20.310> when<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:20.970> hit

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
mower will tend to hop when you hit

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.020 
mower will tend to hop when you hit
bumps<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.750> thus<00:01:22.080> create<00:01:22.470> an<00:01:22.619> uneven<00:01:22.890> cut<00:01:23.369> but

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
bumps and thus create an uneven cut but

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.490 
bumps and thus create an uneven cut but
this<00:01:24.210> mower<00:01:24.509> they've<00:01:24.780> positioned<00:01:25.049> the

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
this mower they've positioned the

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.719 
this mower they've positioned the
battery<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.040> battery<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.460> pretty

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
battery the battery is pretty

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.700 
battery the battery is pretty
lightweight<00:01:26.970> but<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.750> heaviest<00:01:28.080> you

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
lightweight but it is the heaviest you

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.080 
lightweight but it is the heaviest you
know<00:01:28.829> piece<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.549> mower<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.000> they

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
know piece of the mower and they

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.270 
know piece of the mower and they
positioned<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.720> forward<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:32.040> what<00:01:32.189> that

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
positioned it forward and so what that

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.649 
positioned it forward and so what that
does<00:01:32.460> is<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.729> helps<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.939> keep<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.360> front

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
does is it helps to keep the front

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.260 
does is it helps to keep the front
wheels<00:01:33.869> on<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.380> ground<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:34.950> it'll<00:01:35.640> reduce

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
wheels on the ground and it'll reduce

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.210 
wheels on the ground and it'll reduce
that<00:01:36.479> wheel<00:01:36.720> hop<00:01:36.990> which<00:01:37.259> gives<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.680> bad<00:01:37.950> cut

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
that wheel hop which gives you a bad cut

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.999 
that wheel hop which gives you a bad cut
so<00:01:38.490> very<00:01:39.450> good<00:01:39.750> cut<00:01:39.960> with<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.259> bag<00:01:40.409> on<00:01:40.619> or<00:01:40.860> off

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
so very good cut with the bag on or off

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.550 
so very good cut with the bag on or off
very<00:01:41.460> impressed<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.210> even<00:01:43.110> though<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.439> an

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
very impressed and even though it is an

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.530 
very impressed and even though it is an
electric<00:01:43.920> mower<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.340> powers<00:01:44.820> through<00:01:45.270> the

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
electric mower it powers through the

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.990 
electric mower it powers through the
grass<00:01:45.810> very<00:01:46.140> very<00:01:46.439> well<00:01:46.680> here<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.520> only<00:01:47.790> thing

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
grass very very well here the only thing

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.639 
grass very very well here the only thing
that<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.479> do<00:01:48.600> not<00:01:48.869> like<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.320> think<00:01:49.380> they

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
that I do not like and I think they

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.319 
that I do not like and I think they
definitely<00:01:49.920> need<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.159> improve<00:01:50.490> this<00:01:50.640> is<00:01:50.880> no

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
definitely need to improve this is no

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.480 
definitely need to improve this is no
matter<00:01:51.509> what<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.840> do<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.439> maximum<00:01:52.890> cutting

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
matter what I do the maximum cutting

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.969 
matter what I do the maximum cutting
height<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:53.970> can<00:01:54.210> get<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:54.810> three<00:01:55.560> inches

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
height that I can get to is three inches

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.100 
height that I can get to is three inches
and<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.729> definitely<00:01:57.329> don't<00:01:57.420> cut<00:01:57.659> my<00:01:57.810> lawn<00:01:57.990> at

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
and I definitely don't cut my lawn at

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.450 
and I definitely don't cut my lawn at
three<00:01:58.290> inches<00:01:58.409> I'm<00:01:58.619> at<00:01:58.770> three<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.130> half<00:01:59.280> to

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
three inches I'm at three and a half to

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.910 
three inches I'm at three and a half to
even<00:01:59.610> four<00:02:00.030> with<00:02:00.329> my<00:02:00.509> turf<00:02:00.780> type<00:02:01.049> tall<00:02:01.079> fescue

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
even four with my turf type tall fescue

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.010 
even four with my turf type tall fescue
so<00:02:02.549> that's<00:02:02.850> one<00:02:03.060> drawback<00:02:03.299> that<00:02:03.479> I<00:02:03.659> don't<00:02:03.840> like

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
so that's one drawback that I don't like

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.020 
so that's one drawback that I don't like
is<00:02:04.229> how<00:02:04.409> low<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:04.950> but<00:02:05.189> again<00:02:05.219> for<00:02:05.579> most<00:02:05.820> of

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
is how low it is but again for most of

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.760 
is how low it is but again for most of
you<00:02:06.149> three<00:02:06.810> inches<00:02:07.079> which<00:02:07.259> is<00:02:07.290> their<00:02:07.530> max

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
you three inches which is their max

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.100 
you three inches which is their max
height<00:02:08.009> is<00:02:08.220> going<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.550> be<00:02:08.670> just<00:02:08.879> fine<00:02:09.119> lastly<00:02:09.929> I

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
height is going to be just fine lastly I

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.900 
height is going to be just fine lastly I
do<00:02:10.229> like<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.890> way<00:02:11.009> that<00:02:11.190> they<00:02:11.310> have<00:02:11.489> solved

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
do like the way that they have solved

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.510 
do like the way that they have solved
the<00:02:12.000> problem

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
the problem

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.710 
the problem
one<00:02:12.640> problem<00:02:12.880> that<00:02:13.120> a<00:02:13.150> lot<00:02:13.210> of<00:02:13.450> homeowners

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
one problem that a lot of homeowners

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.120 
one problem that a lot of homeowners
happens<00:02:14.170> when<00:02:14.290> they<00:02:14.380> adjust<00:02:14.740> the<00:02:14.860> height<00:02:15.010> of

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
happens when they adjust the height of

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.770 
happens when they adjust the height of
their<00:02:15.190> mower<00:02:15.400> they<00:02:15.970> have<00:02:16.060> to<00:02:16.180> adjust<00:02:16.300> each

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
their mower they have to adjust each

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.230 
their mower they have to adjust each
wheel<00:02:17.230> separately<00:02:17.710> and<00:02:18.100> oftentimes<00:02:18.850> I'll

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
wheel separately and oftentimes I'll

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.000 
wheel separately and oftentimes I'll
find<00:02:19.510> that<00:02:19.660> one<00:02:19.870> wheel<00:02:20.080> is<00:02:20.320> set<00:02:20.470> higher<00:02:20.710> than

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
find that one wheel is set higher than

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.570 
find that one wheel is set higher than
another

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
another

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.250 
another
I<00:02:21.610> found<00:02:22.060> all<00:02:22.210> four<00:02:22.540> at<00:02:22.720> different<00:02:23.080> heights

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
I found all four at different heights

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.760 
I found all four at different heights
with<00:02:23.980> this<00:02:24.190> it's<00:02:24.490> one<00:02:24.910> easy<00:02:25.420> motion<00:02:26.170> here<00:02:26.590> and

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
with this it's one easy motion here and

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.680 
with this it's one easy motion here and
you<00:02:26.890> can<00:02:27.100> raise<00:02:27.340> and<00:02:27.700> lower<00:02:27.730> the<00:02:28.330> entire

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
you can raise and lower the entire

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.840 
you can raise and lower the entire
height<00:02:28.960> of<00:02:28.990> the<00:02:29.320> entire<00:02:29.620> mower<00:02:29.890> for<00:02:30.490> a<00:02:30.550> good

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
height of the entire mower for a good

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.030 
height of the entire mower for a good
consistency<00:02:31.420> so<00:02:31.810> so<00:02:32.410> definitely<00:02:32.860> they've

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
consistency so so definitely they've

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.040 
consistency so so definitely they've
solved<00:02:33.400> the<00:02:33.490> problem<00:02:33.970> there<00:02:34.180> so<00:02:34.210> great<00:02:34.660> job<00:02:34.900> on

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
solved the problem there so great job on

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:53.170 
solved the problem there so great job on
that<00:02:40.290> all<00:02:41.290> right

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.479 

okay<00:02:53.840> next<00:02:54.140> is<00:02:54.319> how<00:02:54.530> does<00:02:54.799> the<00:02:54.890> mower<00:02:55.040> cut<00:02:55.340> in

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
okay next is how does the mower cut in

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.399 
okay next is how does the mower cut in
super<00:02:55.879> thick<00:02:56.090> turf<00:02:56.329> so<00:02:56.569> over<00:02:57.049> here<00:02:57.200> on<00:02:57.290> my<00:02:57.319> side

00:02:57.399 --> 00:02:57.409 
super thick turf so over here on my side

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:00.009 
super thick turf so over here on my side
yard<00:02:57.890> I<00:02:58.069> have<00:02:58.189> let<00:02:58.400> this<00:02:58.579> go<00:02:58.819> for<00:02:58.849> 15<00:02:59.720> days

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
yard I have let this go for 15 days

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.289 
yard I have let this go for 15 days
without<00:03:00.650> mowing<00:03:01.189> typically<00:03:01.640> I<00:03:01.670> mow<00:03:01.909> every

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
without mowing typically I mow every

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:04.479 
without mowing typically I mow every
five<00:03:02.569> to<00:03:02.599> seven<00:03:02.989> days<00:03:03.170> especially<00:03:03.950> here<00:03:04.400> in

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
five to seven days especially here in

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.009 
five to seven days especially here in
the<00:03:04.579> later<00:03:04.760> spring<00:03:05.150> but<00:03:05.599> I<00:03:05.629> went<00:03:05.780> ahead<00:03:05.870> and

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
the later spring but I went ahead and

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.869 
the later spring but I went ahead and
let<00:03:06.170> this<00:03:06.290> one<00:03:06.349> go<00:03:06.620> 15<00:03:07.099> days<00:03:07.250> on<00:03:07.430> purpose<00:03:07.760> so

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:07.879 
let this one go 15 days on purpose so

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:09.940 
let this one go 15 days on purpose so
this<00:03:08.030> is<00:03:08.150> double-height<00:03:08.629> my<00:03:09.140> lawn<00:03:09.379> is<00:03:09.560> again

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
this is double-height my lawn is again

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.280 
this is double-height my lawn is again
turf<00:03:10.220> type<00:03:10.489> tall<00:03:10.519> fescue<00:03:11.180> super<00:03:11.599> thick<00:03:11.840> anyway

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
turf type tall fescue super thick anyway

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.199 
turf type tall fescue super thick anyway
so<00:03:12.799> this<00:03:12.920> is<00:03:12.980> the<00:03:13.189> real<00:03:13.370> test<00:03:13.670> and<00:03:13.879> we're<00:03:13.970> going

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
so this is the real test and we're going

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.479 
so this is the real test and we're going
full<00:03:14.540> width<00:03:14.810> right<00:03:15.290> down<00:03:15.590> the<00:03:15.769> middle<00:03:15.799> so<00:03:16.220> if

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
full width right down the middle so if

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.190 
full width right down the middle so if
this<00:03:16.700> thing<00:03:16.879> was<00:03:17.000> going<00:03:17.180> to<00:03:17.239> bog<00:03:17.450> down<00:03:17.689> this<00:03:18.049> is

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
this thing was going to bog down this is

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.530 
this thing was going to bog down this is
what<00:03:18.349> it<00:03:18.439> would<00:03:18.530> do<00:03:18.709> it<00:03:18.859> and<00:03:19.239> as<00:03:20.239> you<00:03:20.359> can<00:03:20.480> see

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
what it would do it and as you can see

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.809 
what it would do it and as you can see
the<00:03:20.810> good<00:03:20.989> news<00:03:21.140> is<00:03:21.319> it<00:03:21.500> did<00:03:21.769> not<00:03:21.980> bog<00:03:22.340> down<00:03:22.549> and

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
the good news is it did not bog down and

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:24.429 
the good news is it did not bog down and
I'm<00:03:22.909> mulching<00:03:23.390> here<00:03:23.569> and<00:03:23.750> I'm<00:03:23.840> not<00:03:24.019> seeing<00:03:24.200> any

00:03:24.429 --> 00:03:24.439 
I'm mulching here and I'm not seeing any

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:26.710 
I'm mulching here and I'm not seeing any
clumping<00:03:24.980> or<00:03:25.129> anything<00:03:25.340> so<00:03:26.060> right<00:03:26.359> there<00:03:26.569> it

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
clumping or anything so right there it

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.330 
clumping or anything so right there it
passes<00:03:27.139> the<00:03:27.290> biggest<00:03:27.680> test<00:03:27.920> that<00:03:28.099> I<00:03:28.190> would

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
passes the biggest test that I would

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.800 
passes the biggest test that I would
have<00:03:28.459> given<00:03:28.549> it<00:03:28.790> which<00:03:28.909> is<00:03:29.060> how<00:03:29.180> does<00:03:29.329> it<00:03:29.450> do<00:03:29.599> in

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
have given it which is how does it do in

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.559 
have given it which is how does it do in
very<00:03:30.799> thick<00:03:31.129> overgrown<00:03:31.700> turf<00:03:31.940> because<00:03:32.150> gas

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
very thick overgrown turf because gas

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:34.270 
very thick overgrown turf because gas
mowers<00:03:33.019> typically<00:03:33.560> if<00:03:33.650> you<00:03:33.709> have<00:03:33.829> a<00:03:33.859> quality

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
mowers typically if you have a quality

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.069 
mowers typically if you have a quality
one<00:03:34.430> can<00:03:34.909> power<00:03:35.150> right<00:03:35.450> through<00:03:35.690> that<00:03:35.840> and

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
one can power right through that and

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:37.929 
one can power right through that and
actually<00:03:36.530> the<00:03:36.769> ego<00:03:37.099> did<00:03:37.310> a<00:03:37.340> really<00:03:37.639> good<00:03:37.879> job

00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:37.939 
actually the ego did a really good job

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:47.540 
actually the ego did a really good job
here<00:03:38.359> as<00:03:38.480> well<00:03:38.659> so<00:03:38.900> a<00:03:39.109> plus<00:03:39.590> on<00:03:39.799> this<00:03:39.980> one

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.890 

another<00:03:48.550> curveball<00:03:48.910> I<00:03:49.150> threw<00:03:49.480> out<00:03:49.510> it<00:03:49.630> is<00:03:49.720> how

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
another curveball I threw out it is how

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.350 
another curveball I threw out it is how
does<00:03:49.960> it<00:03:50.200> do<00:03:50.470> when<00:03:50.890> it's<00:03:51.280> low<00:03:51.760> on<00:03:51.790> battery

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
does it do when it's low on battery

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.480 
does it do when it's low on battery
power<00:03:52.450> and<00:03:52.900> so<00:03:53.440> what<00:03:53.620> I<00:03:53.650> did<00:03:53.860> was<00:03:54.040> I<00:03:54.130> had<00:03:54.160> mowed

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 
power and so what I did was I had mowed

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.240 
power and so what I did was I had mowed
my<00:03:55.000> lawn<00:03:55.030> and<00:03:55.600> my<00:03:56.290> neighbor<00:03:56.500> mowed<00:03:56.740> his<00:03:56.920> front

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
my lawn and my neighbor mowed his front

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.370 
my lawn and my neighbor mowed his front
lawn<00:03:57.400> last<00:03:57.970> week<00:03:58.360> so<00:03:58.690> this<00:03:58.870> thing<00:03:59.080> was<00:03:59.200> running

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
lawn last week so this thing was running

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.310 
lawn last week so this thing was running
out<00:03:59.650> about<00:03:59.890> about<00:04:00.400> 40<00:04:00.970> minutes<00:04:01.240> of<00:04:01.540> mow<00:04:02.020> time

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
out about about 40 minutes of mow time

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.500 
out about about 40 minutes of mow time
and<00:04:02.680> then<00:04:02.800> I<00:04:02.830> let<00:04:03.040> it<00:04:03.070> sit<00:04:03.160> for<00:04:03.670> a<00:04:03.700> week<00:04:03.910> pulled

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
and then I let it sit for a week pulled

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.940 
and then I let it sit for a week pulled
it<00:04:04.660> out<00:04:04.750> and<00:04:04.990> pulled<00:04:05.170> it<00:04:05.260> into<00:04:05.410> my<00:04:05.500> side<00:04:05.680> yard

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
it out and pulled it into my side yard

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.550 
it out and pulled it into my side yard
now<00:04:06.070> this<00:04:06.250> is<00:04:06.370> that<00:04:06.490> same<00:04:06.850> overgrown<00:04:07.660> area<00:04:08.050> but

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
now this is that same overgrown area but

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.590 
now this is that same overgrown area but
this<00:04:08.680> is<00:04:08.890> after<00:04:09.160> 40<00:04:09.520> minutes<00:04:09.550> of<00:04:09.910> run<00:04:10.150> time<00:04:10.360> and

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
this is after 40 minutes of run time and

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.330 
this is after 40 minutes of run time and
the<00:04:10.810> mowers<00:04:11.020> been<00:04:11.350> sitting<00:04:11.740> with<00:04:11.830> the<00:04:11.980> battery

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
the mowers been sitting with the battery

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.270 
the mowers been sitting with the battery
in<00:04:12.640> it<00:04:12.880> for<00:04:13.480> a<00:04:13.510> week<00:04:13.810> and<00:04:14.050> here<00:04:14.530> you<00:04:14.650> go<00:04:14.830> it's

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
in it for a week and here you go it's

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.280 
in it for a week and here you go it's
powering<00:04:15.790> through<00:04:16.150> and<00:04:16.360> it's<00:04:16.480> not<00:04:16.540> losing<00:04:16.930> any

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
powering through and it's not losing any

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.750 
powering through and it's not losing any
performance<00:04:17.950> because<00:04:18.190> this<00:04:18.400> is<00:04:18.550> the<00:04:18.610> whole

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
performance because this is the whole

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.970 
performance because this is the whole
thing<00:04:18.940> with<00:04:19.120> a<00:04:19.150> battery<00:04:19.510> mower<00:04:19.780> right<00:04:20.020> if<00:04:20.260> it's

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
thing with a battery mower right if it's

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.620 
thing with a battery mower right if it's
going<00:04:21.190> to<00:04:21.250> get<00:04:21.400> to<00:04:21.549> the<00:04:21.640> end<00:04:21.880> of<00:04:22.090> its<00:04:22.240> battery

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
going to get to the end of its battery

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.080 
going to get to the end of its battery
life<00:04:22.720> before<00:04:23.260> it<00:04:23.320> needs<00:04:23.410> a<00:04:23.560> charge<00:04:23.770> and<00:04:24.130> so<00:04:24.820> if

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
life before it needs a charge and so if

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.260 
life before it needs a charge and so if
you<00:04:25.270> lose<00:04:26.250> performance<00:04:27.250> say<00:04:27.460> for<00:04:27.670> the<00:04:27.760> last<00:04:27.940> 10

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
you lose performance say for the last 10

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.870 
you lose performance say for the last 10
minutes<00:04:28.420> of<00:04:28.660> the<00:04:28.810> cut<00:04:29.050> well<00:04:29.320> that<00:04:29.830> really<00:04:30.250> kind

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
minutes of the cut well that really kind

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.370 
minutes of the cut well that really kind
of<00:04:30.940> hurts<00:04:31.240> you<00:04:31.420> and<00:04:31.570> to<00:04:31.900> me<00:04:31.990> that<00:04:32.020> would<00:04:32.230> be<00:04:32.290> a

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
of hurts you and to me that would be a

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.830 
of hurts you and to me that would be a
drawback<00:04:32.800> but<00:04:33.370> no<00:04:33.520> this<00:04:33.820> performed<00:04:34.450> the<00:04:34.630> same

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
drawback but no this performed the same

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.750 
drawback but no this performed the same
as<00:04:35.080> with<00:04:35.260> a<00:04:35.290> full<00:04:35.620> charge<00:04:35.920> as<00:04:36.160> it<00:04:36.220> did<00:04:36.520> at<00:04:36.640> the

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
as with a full charge as it did at the

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.010 
as with a full charge as it did at the
end<00:04:36.940> of<00:04:37.120> the<00:04:37.210> charge<00:04:37.450> and<00:04:37.660> as<00:04:37.720> you'll<00:04:37.870> hear

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
end of the charge and as you'll hear

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.990 
end of the charge and as you'll hear
here<00:04:38.350> right<00:04:39.040> at<00:04:39.160> this<00:04:39.310> point<00:04:39.550> is<00:04:39.730> when<00:04:39.880> the

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
here right at this point is when the

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.310 
here right at this point is when the
battery<00:04:40.300> dies<00:04:40.540> and<00:04:40.780> it<00:04:40.840> just<00:04:40.990> completely

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
battery dies and it just completely

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.650 
battery dies and it just completely
shuts<00:04:41.710> off<00:04:44.970> so<00:04:45.970> what<00:04:46.150> does<00:04:46.240> that<00:04:46.360> mean<00:04:46.540> it

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
shuts off so what does that mean it

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.000 
shuts off so what does that mean it
means<00:04:46.690> when<00:04:46.930> I<00:04:46.960> tell<00:04:47.260> you<00:04:47.320> that<00:04:47.440> I<00:04:47.500> can<00:04:47.740> pretty

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
means when I tell you that I can pretty

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.160 
means when I tell you that I can pretty
much<00:04:48.100> get<00:04:48.460> almost<00:04:48.850> an<00:04:49.000> hour<00:04:49.210> of<00:04:49.570> mow<00:04:49.780> time<00:04:50.020> out

much get almost an hour of mow time out

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.020 
much get almost an hour of mow time out
of<00:04:50.290> this<00:04:50.410> it's<00:04:50.860> one<00:04:51.250> hour<00:04:51.460> of<00:04:51.760> peak

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
of this it's one hour of peak

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.270 
of this it's one hour of peak
performance<00:04:52.270> mow<00:04:52.990> time<00:04:53.230> there's<00:04:53.500> no<00:04:53.680> like<00:04:53.920> lag

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
performance mow time there's no like lag

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.760 
performance mow time there's no like lag
at<00:04:54.580> the<00:04:54.730> end<00:04:54.910> it<00:04:55.150> goes<00:04:55.660> all<00:04:55.960> the<00:04:55.990> way<00:04:56.260> and<00:04:56.500> dies

at the end it goes all the way and dies

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:57.930 
at the end it goes all the way and dies
and<00:04:57.070> I<00:04:57.160> don't<00:04:57.310> know<00:04:57.400> if<00:04:57.490> they<00:04:57.610> did<00:04:57.760> that<00:04:57.790> on

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
and I don't know if they did that on

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.250 
and I don't know if they did that on
purpose<00:04:58.030> or<00:04:58.570> if<00:04:58.630> that's<00:04:58.810> some<00:04:58.990> way<00:04:59.110> they
