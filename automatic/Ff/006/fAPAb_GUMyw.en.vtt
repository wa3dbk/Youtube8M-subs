00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:06.939
 Good people, this is a scare to the super. 

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:10.000
 Easy, I'm going to teach you to 

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:13.870
 do five different types of ties 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.599
 right there if it is very common and there is 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.699
 use clothing and decoration and gifts 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:20.470
 it's very you see a lot of mass 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:25.329
 So I'm going to teach five types of stores to 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:27.970
 you're using needle thread scissors 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:29.199
 and different types of tapes what you 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.720
 you are at home 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:34.240
 well this is what people you know is a 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.680
 washing machine right where you where 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.610
 it helps a lot you create your 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.250
 own ties 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.500
 you can change size or teach 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.930
 What are you doing in being able to stay great? 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.330
 Little ones, I agree but if you do not 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.280
 have you here you can ask your friends 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.320
 I'm your friend, your friend, to help. 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.550
 making fingers when I'm not with 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.080
 This is what I do with my fingers and 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.000
 works very well 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:58.050
 The first batch I show you is 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.430
 this bow here is the bow 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.630
 conventional wisdom that you should know 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:13.510
 how do you do 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:15.130
 neco's just that it's super easy and little leg 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.680
 you pull according to the size you 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.600
 You want me to stay close, this is a tie. 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.840
 conventional way that we do even with 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:26.110
 Right sweet is very well known. 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.430
 the second to the conventional ones for you is 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.470
 this loop here 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.720
 it looks a lot like the conventional loop 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.729
 and his name is different it 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.590
 It gets more perfect because it is 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.870
 just made in the loop machine 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.710

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:45.090
 look here is the next I will want 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.049
 this size so I'm going to put 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.960
 remembering that if you do not have a machine 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:53.590
 can use two fingers of someone 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:59.430
 will cross will pass from behind will come 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.430
 underneath and will give a knot 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.819
 soon supersimples 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:12.080
 I'm going to take it down again, I'm not going to have it. 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.880
 Doubts how to take, I'll leave it again. 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:21.540
 So you two do not lay eggs there. 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:24.090
 put behind crosses underneath and 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:33.569
 gives a conventional node kinkle 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:35.940
 You're ready, the machine is ready. 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:39.530
 made in the machine from there if he 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:42.660
 this way is perfect perfect perfect 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.299
 one more thing in the loop machine is this 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.190
 O here it's double is the double loop is 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.440

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:12.209
 ahead the cruise crossed here passes 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.530
 under again to win back to 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:18.720
 front 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:22.620
 once crosses here in front and crosses 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:27.290
 goes under and goes down and gives a 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:31.320
 just like the previous one 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:34.980
