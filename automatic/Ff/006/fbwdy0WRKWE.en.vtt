00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
directly at the running back and then

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.020 
directly at the running back and then
basically<00:00:54.960> just<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:55.860> tune<00:00:56.129> with<00:00:56.340> him<00:00:56.520> that

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
looks directly at him and then makes no

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.700 
looks directly at him and then makes no
attempt<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.329> continue<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.260> pressure<00:01:04.470> the

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
attempt to continue to pressure the

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.160 
attempt to continue to pressure the
quarterback<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.400> instead<00:01:05.729> stops<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.540> starts

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
quarterback and instead stops and starts

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.469 
quarterback and instead stops and starts
to<00:01:07.409> run<00:01:07.560> away<00:01:07.799> from<00:01:07.860> them<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.430> mean<00:01:08.790> how<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.240> this

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
to run away from them I mean how is this

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.730 
to run away from them I mean how is this
indicative<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.909> actual<00:01:11.909> NFL<00:01:12.570> play<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:13.619> know

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
indicative of actual NFL play you know

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.350 
indicative of actual NFL play you know
and<00:01:13.950> then<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:14.310> most<00:01:14.640> ironic<00:01:14.970> thing<00:01:15.270> about

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
and then the I most ironic thing about

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.690 
and then the I most ironic thing about
it<00:01:15.659> is<00:01:15.840> after<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.650> play<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:16.950> over<00:01:17.070> he<00:01:17.340> goes<00:01:17.520> up

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
it is after the play is over he goes up

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.249 
it is after the play is over he goes up
and<00:01:17.850> hits<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.030> quarterback<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:19.049> know<00:01:19.140> how

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
and hits the quarterback you know how

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.880 
and hits the quarterback you know how
can<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.590> be<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:20.689> untuned<00:01:21.689> with<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.140> play<00:01:22.409> one

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
can you be so untuned with the play one

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.620 
can you be so untuned with the play one
second<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.580> then<00:01:23.729> hitting<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.150> quarterback

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
second to then hitting the quarterback

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.840 
second to then hitting the quarterback
after<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.080> throw<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.470> next<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:25.950> then<00:01:26.490> just<00:01:26.729> to

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
after to throw the next and then just to

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.700 
after to throw the next and then just to
look<00:01:27.180> at<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.420> offensive<00:01:27.750> line<00:01:27.900> interactions

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
look at the offensive line interactions

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.940 
look at the offensive line interactions
on<00:01:28.860> this<00:01:29.009> play<00:01:29.990> honestly<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.380> leaves<00:01:31.829> you

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
on this play honestly it leaves you

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.490 
on this play honestly it leaves you
frustrated<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.700> mean<00:01:33.090> even<00:01:33.270> as<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> defensive

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
frustrated I mean even as a defensive

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.410 
frustrated I mean even as a defensive
player<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:35.400> know<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:35.909> were<00:01:36.060> able<00:01:36.150> to

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
player to know that you were able to

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.910 
player to know that you were able to
generate<00:01:36.750> pressure<00:01:37.079> on<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.320> quarterback<00:01:37.619> at

immediately<00:01:42.090> turns<00:01:42.420> in<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.630> loop<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.049> then<00:01:43.259> it

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
immediately turns in a loop and then it

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.139 
immediately turns in a loop and then it
kind<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.619> shimmers<00:01:43.890> in<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.729> field<00:01:44.939> a<00:01:45.030> little

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
kind of shimmers in the field a little

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.480 
kind of shimmers in the field a little
bit<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.659> then<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.439> see<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:47.040> running<00:01:47.340> back

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
bit and then you see the running back

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.190 
bit and then you see the running back
comes<00:01:47.759> up<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.180> they've<00:01:48.450> run<00:01:48.630> into<00:01:48.659> each<00:01:49.020> other

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
comes up and they've run into each other

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.050 
comes up and they've run into each other
and<00:01:49.530> then<00:01:50.220> all<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.490> sudden<00:01:50.759> he's<00:01:50.850> going<00:01:51.000> to

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
and then all of a sudden he's going to

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.660 
and then all of a sudden he's going to
come<00:01:51.210> up<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.479> get<00:01:51.570> stuck<00:01:51.899> here<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.520> just<00:01:53.520> does

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
come up and get stuck here and just does

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.690 
come up and get stuck here and just does
nothing<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:54.149> mean<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.479> entire<00:01:54.630> play<00:01:55.549> and<00:01:56.549> when

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
nothing I mean the entire play and when

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.830 
nothing I mean the entire play and when
we<00:01:56.759> go<00:01:56.909> over<00:01:56.939> we<00:01:57.240> take<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.450> look<00:01:57.600> at<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.810> other

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
we go over we take a look at the other

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.149 
we go over we take a look at the other
side<00:01:58.229> you're<00:01:58.439> going<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:58.649> see<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:59.040> know<00:01:59.130> a

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
side you're going to see you know a

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.770 
side you're going to see you know a
little<00:01:59.399> bit<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.729> same<00:01:59.969> with

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
little bit of the same with

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.980 
little bit of the same with
number<00:02:01.320> 72<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:02.130> mean<00:02:02.820> where<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.390> improved

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
number 72 I mean where is the improved

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.570 
number 72 I mean where is the improved
logic<00:02:04.409> here<00:02:04.590> when<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:04.799> comes<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.130> these<00:02:05.250> lines

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
logic here when it comes to these lines

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.150 
logic here when it comes to these lines
you<00:02:06.510> know<00:02:06.540> I<00:02:06.659> know<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:07.110> we're<00:02:07.500> being<00:02:07.680> told<00:02:07.920> it

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
you know I know that we're being told it

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.139 
you know I know that we're being told it
you<00:02:08.429> know<00:02:08.550> I<00:02:08.580> know<00:02:08.670> that<00:02:08.880> we're<00:02:09.000> being

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
you know I know that we're being

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.029 
you know I know that we're being
preached<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.690> but<00:02:09.899> you<00:02:10.380> know<00:02:10.410> even<00:02:10.770> when<00:02:10.920> you

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
preached it but you know even when you

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.490 
preached it but you know even when you
look<00:02:11.310> at<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.700> way<00:02:11.880> he<00:02:12.660> attempts<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.140> protect

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
look at the way he attempts to protect

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.110 
look at the way he attempts to protect
the<00:02:13.590> quarterback<00:02:13.740> I<00:02:14.190> mean<00:02:14.370> first<00:02:14.580> of<00:02:14.730> all<00:02:14.910> I've

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
the quarterback I mean first of all I've

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.150 
the quarterback I mean first of all I've
got<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:15.870> defense<00:02:16.230> called<00:02:16.530> in<00:02:16.680> it<00:02:16.770> contained

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
got the defense called in it contained

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.070 
got the defense called in it contained
so<00:02:17.489> they're<00:02:17.730> actually<00:02:18.090> meant<00:02:18.330> to<00:02:18.450> be<00:02:18.569> tight<00:02:18.840> in

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
so they're actually meant to be tight in

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.229 
so they're actually meant to be tight in
their<00:02:19.410> pass<00:02:19.650> rush<00:02:19.950> but<00:02:20.250> for<00:02:20.730> him<00:02:20.850> to<00:02:20.940> come<00:02:21.060> off

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
their pass rush but for him to come off

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.020 
their pass rush but for him to come off
here<00:02:21.540> not<00:02:22.200> assistant<00:02:22.800> of<00:02:22.860> law<00:02:23.069> let<00:02:23.880> the

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
here not assistant of law let the

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.550 
here not assistant of law let the
full-back<00:02:24.510> get<00:02:24.959> behind<00:02:25.620> him<00:02:26.069> yet<00:02:26.760> in<00:02:26.970> between

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
full-back get behind him yet in between

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.020 
full-back get behind him yet in between
the<00:02:28.560> linebacker<00:02:29.010> that's<00:02:29.370> bringing<00:02:29.730> pressure

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
the linebacker that's bringing pressure

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.180 
the linebacker that's bringing pressure
off<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.420> edge<00:02:30.569> or<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.200> defensive<00:02:31.860> end<00:02:31.950> rather

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
off the edge or the defensive end rather

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.000 
off the edge or the defensive end rather
and<00:02:32.489> then<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.150> follow<00:02:33.690> this<00:02:33.959> path<00:02:34.380> back<00:02:34.709> to<00:02:34.769> the

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
and then to follow this path back to the

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.620 
and then to follow this path back to the
quarterback<00:02:35.340> it's<00:02:35.640> not<00:02:35.820> even<00:02:36.060> a<00:02:36.150> path<00:02:36.420> that

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
quarterback it's not even a path that

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.500 
quarterback it's not even a path that
would<00:02:36.750> be<00:02:37.080> indicative<00:02:37.410> of<00:02:38.070> you<00:02:38.280> actually

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
would be indicative of you actually
