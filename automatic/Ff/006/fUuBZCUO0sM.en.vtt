like<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:02.010> it's<00:01:02.190> kind<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.399> melted<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.229> it's

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
like that it's kind of melted and it's

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.960 
like that it's kind of melted and it's
like<00:01:04.320> an<00:01:04.439> oil<00:01:04.650> so<00:01:04.949> what<00:01:05.250> I'm<00:01:05.339> gonna<00:01:05.519> add<00:01:05.729> to

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
like an oil so what I'm gonna add to

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.980 
like an oil so what I'm gonna add to
that<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:07.430> this<00:01:08.430> molasses<00:01:09.390> which<00:01:09.630> is<00:01:09.780> always

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
that is this molasses which is always

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.960 
that is this molasses which is always
sticky<00:01:10.680> on<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.830> bottom<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.549> put<00:01:11.820> that

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
sticky on the bottom so I put that

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.210 
sticky on the bottom so I put that
little<00:01:12.180> thing<00:01:13.170> under<00:01:13.619> there<00:01:13.799> so<00:01:13.979> that<00:01:14.130> it

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
little thing under there so that it

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.740 
little thing under there so that it
doesn't<00:01:14.490> drip<00:01:14.640> but<00:01:14.790> I'm<00:01:14.939> gonna<00:01:15.060> put<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.299> half<00:01:15.600> a

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
doesn't drip but I'm gonna put a half a

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.260 
doesn't drip but I'm gonna put a half a
cup<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:16.130> molasses<00:01:17.130> in<00:01:17.280> with<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.580> coconut<00:01:18.000> oil

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
cup of molasses in with that coconut oil

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.190 
cup of molasses in with that coconut oil
so<00:01:18.600> I'm<00:01:18.689> just<00:01:18.840> gonna<00:01:19.080> do<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:21.049> now<00:01:22.049> what

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
so I'm just gonna do that and now what

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.929 
so I'm just gonna do that and now what
I'm<00:01:22.320> doing<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.650> I'm<00:01:22.860> whisking<00:01:23.130> together<00:01:23.670> that

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
I'm doing is I'm whisking together that

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.450 
I'm doing is I'm whisking together that
melted<00:01:24.600> coconut<00:01:24.900> oil<00:01:25.290> with<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:25.830> molasses

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
melted coconut oil with that molasses

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.859 
melted coconut oil with that molasses
which<00:01:26.640> can<00:01:26.850> be<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.000> little<00:01:27.090> bit<00:01:27.330> tricky<00:01:27.750> at

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
which can be a little bit tricky at

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.050 
which can be a little bit tricky at
first<00:01:27.900> because<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.799> could<00:01:29.520> be<00:01:29.610> hard<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.909> get

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
first because it could be hard to get

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.120 
first because it could be hard to get
them<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.210> kind<00:01:30.570> of<00:01:30.720> actually<00:01:31.470> incorporate

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
them to kind of actually incorporate

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.340 
them to kind of actually incorporate
together<00:01:32.549> but<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.329> looking<00:01:33.509> real<00:01:33.840> good

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
together but this is looking real good

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.039 
together but this is looking real good
nice<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.250> smooth

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
nice and smooth

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:37.870 
nice and smooth
okay<00:01:36.710> I'm<00:01:36.950> gonna<00:01:37.039> put<00:01:37.280> that<00:01:37.369> off<00:01:37.579> to<00:01:37.729> the<00:01:37.789> side

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
okay I'm gonna put that off to the side

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.969 
okay I'm gonna put that off to the side
and<00:01:38.600> I'll<00:01:38.780> be<00:01:38.929> adding<00:01:39.079> it<00:01:39.320> in<00:01:39.439> in<00:01:39.590> just<00:01:39.770> a

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
and I'll be adding it in in just a

a cup of maple syrup I'll grab my 1/2

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:12.940 
a cup of maple syrup I'll grab my 1/2
cup<00:02:06.259> measure<00:02:11.110> we<00:02:12.110> did<00:02:12.290> a<00:02:12.319> sugar-free

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
cup measure we did a sugar-free

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.110 
cup measure we did a sugar-free
experiment<00:02:13.670> a<00:02:14.269> couple<00:02:15.019> months<00:02:15.200> ago<00:02:15.380> and<00:02:16.120> we

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
experiment a couple months ago and we

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.030 
experiment a couple months ago and we
started<00:02:17.450> using<00:02:17.630> more<00:02:18.110> honey<00:02:18.380> and<00:02:18.590> maple<00:02:18.739> syrup

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
started using more honey and maple syrup

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.949 
started using more honey and maple syrup
instead<00:02:19.459> of<00:02:19.640> refined<00:02:20.030> sugar<00:02:20.390> and<00:02:20.420> I<00:02:20.660> loved<00:02:20.930> it

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
instead of refined sugar and I loved it

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.170 
instead of refined sugar and I loved it
and<00:02:21.170> especially<00:02:22.160> in<00:02:22.459> these<00:02:22.579> muffins<00:02:22.940> because

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
and especially in these muffins because

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.699 
and especially in these muffins because
they're<00:02:23.480> Gingerbread<00:02:23.930> so<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.230> maple<00:02:24.500> syrup

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
they're Gingerbread so the maple syrup

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.740 
they're Gingerbread so the maple syrup
is<00:02:24.950> perfect<00:02:25.370> for<00:02:25.519> that<00:02:25.549> and<00:02:26.390> then<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.599> other

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
is perfect for that and then the other

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:27.880 
is perfect for that and then the other
thing<00:02:26.900> I'm<00:02:26.989> going<00:02:27.110> to<00:02:27.170> put<00:02:27.319> in<00:02:27.410> is<00:02:27.560> a<00:02:27.590> little

so let's get that in there and now I'm
just<00:03:55.760> gonna<00:03:55.909> stir<00:03:56.180> it<00:03:56.269> up

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:56.629 
just gonna stir it up

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:58.330 
just gonna stir it up
one<00:03:57.139> thing<00:03:57.319> about<00:03:57.349> muffins<00:03:57.920> you<00:03:58.129> know<00:03:58.220> they

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
one thing about muffins you know they

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.580 
one thing about muffins you know they
always<00:03:58.519> say<00:03:59.120> you<00:03:59.510> shouldn't<00:04:00.049> stir<00:04:00.319> it<00:04:00.439> too

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
always say you shouldn't stir it too

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.199 
always say you shouldn't stir it too
much<00:04:00.739> I<00:04:01.010> always<00:04:01.310> have<00:04:01.579> a<00:04:01.609> really<00:04:01.879> hard<00:04:02.060> time

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
much I always have a really hard time

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:03.699 
much I always have a really hard time
with<00:04:02.269> that<00:04:02.540> but<00:04:02.689> I<00:04:02.750> always<00:04:02.959> just<00:04:03.139> try<00:04:03.290> to<00:04:03.319> count

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
with that but I always just try to count

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.229 
with that but I always just try to count
the<00:04:03.829> number<00:04:03.920> of<00:04:04.189> stirs<00:04:04.519> I'm<00:04:04.760> doing<00:04:05.000> so<00:04:05.180> I<00:04:05.209> guess

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
the number of stirs I'm doing so I guess

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.330 
the number of stirs I'm doing so I guess
you<00:04:05.989> can<00:04:06.139> count<00:04:06.379> with<00:04:06.530> me<00:04:06.590> and<00:04:06.859> we'll<00:04:06.950> see<00:04:06.980> how

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
you can count with me and we'll see how

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:08.890 
you can count with me and we'll see how
many<00:04:07.400> I<00:04:07.609> actually<00:04:07.879> have<00:04:08.150> to<00:04:08.269> do<00:04:08.419> here<00:04:08.659> to<00:04:08.810> get

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
many I actually have to do here to get

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.559 
many I actually have to do here to get
it<00:04:09.049> mixed<00:04:12.040> ok<00:04:13.040> it's<00:04:13.189> almost<00:04:13.489> there<00:04:13.730> it's<00:04:13.790> a

it mixed ok it's almost there it's a
little<00:04:14.720> bit<00:04:14.989> lumpy<00:04:15.230> but<00:04:15.680> that's<00:04:15.889> usually<00:04:16.430> ok

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
little bit lumpy but that's usually ok

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.969 
little bit lumpy but that's usually ok
we'll<00:04:17.750> give<00:04:17.900> it<00:04:17.930> a<00:04:18.049> couple<00:04:18.289> more<00:04:18.620> gentle<00:04:19.220> stirs

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
it should be okay I actually already

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.290

greased this muffin tin so I'm gonna
this<00:04:35.960> is<00:04:36.110> my<00:04:36.229> little<00:04:36.440> trick<00:04:36.680> it's<00:04:37.250> not<00:04:37.400> really

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
this is my little trick it's not really

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.279 
this is my little trick it's not really
that<00:04:37.639> special<00:04:38.210> but<00:04:38.330> I<00:04:38.389> use<00:04:38.659> that<00:04:38.870> ice<00:04:39.020> cream

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:39.289 
that special but I use that ice cream

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:40.450 
that special but I use that ice cream
scoop<00:04:39.590> so<00:04:39.740> I'm<00:04:39.800> gonna<00:04:39.889> get<00:04:40.039> my<00:04:40.070> ice<00:04:40.159> cream

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
scoop so I'm gonna get my ice cream

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.100 
scoop so I'm gonna get my ice cream
scoop<00:04:40.729> and<00:04:40.909> then<00:04:41.030> scoop<00:04:41.330> the<00:04:41.479> batter<00:04:41.599> in<00:04:41.930> there

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
scoop and then scoop the batter in there

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.320 
scoop and then scoop the batter in there
so<00:04:42.680> what<00:04:42.800> I<00:04:42.860> do<00:04:42.979> is<00:04:43.190> I<00:04:43.280> just<00:04:43.520> use<00:04:43.729> it<00:04:43.760> to<00:04:43.909> scoop

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
so what I do is I just use it to scoop

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.909 
so what I do is I just use it to scoop
in<00:04:44.510> it's<00:04:44.690> one<00:04:44.780> of<00:04:44.870> those<00:04:44.990> old-fashioned<00:04:45.740> ones

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
and then I did sleep right in there and

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.460 
and then I did sleep right in there and

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.230 
of the muffins

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.410 
of the muffins
so<00:05:10.470> I<00:05:10.500> like<00:05:10.770> to<00:05:10.920> be<00:05:11.010> pretty<00:05:11.310> generous<00:05:12.210> with

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 
so I like to be pretty generous with

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.480 
so I like to be pretty generous with
that<00:05:12.690> because<00:05:13.080> what<00:05:13.500> happens<00:05:13.890> is<00:05:14.100> as<00:05:14.280> the

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
that because what happens is as the

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.060 
that because what happens is as the
muffins<00:05:14.850> rise<00:05:15.230> the<00:05:16.230> sugar<00:05:16.440> kind<00:05:16.770> of<00:05:16.860> falls

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
muffins rise the sugar kind of falls

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.890 
muffins rise the sugar kind of falls
into<00:05:17.310> the<00:05:17.550> crevices<00:05:18.060> but<00:05:18.300> it<00:05:18.420> doesn't<00:05:18.750> lose

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
into the crevices but it doesn't lose

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.200 
into the crevices but it doesn't lose
its<00:05:18.960> texture<00:05:19.590> so<00:05:20.310> it's<00:05:20.520> like<00:05:20.670> I<00:05:20.820> always<00:05:20.940> think

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
its texture so it's like I always think
