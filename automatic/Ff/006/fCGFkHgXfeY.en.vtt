00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:06.009
 we have a final that would facilitate if 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:09.459
 let's go to a semifinal 

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:13.780
 Luck is missing we talk about the project back 

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:16.240
 just luck is very little little no 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.550
 I know nobody has no one has a 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.930
 answer today is to say that what 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.550
 What do you really need for this? 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.910
 children are pick us up and it was done 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.910
 single 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.850
 but because with that we could also 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.430
 answer what happens to england with 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.470
 these players with a technician with the 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.390
 Capello experience that happens 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.940
 italy that four years ago is 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.650
 singing the world and now it was new 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.320
 spare but Argentina had replacement 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.300
 argentina has players that juanes the 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.510
 best league in the world and we have some 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.430
 no selection has not been done so by 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.770
 one issue or the other in 2002 in 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.220
 the 2006 we always remain outside always 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.220
 they pass us 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.129
 I have not stopped the players are 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.030
 it is obvious that if we start the last one the 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.370
 defeats against Germany that is 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.490
 a little bit 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:10.200
 to turn from did not take off sin is 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.750
 a great selection anyone me that 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.480
 same out and I see that all the equipment 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.210
 they are not afraid if all the teams 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.230
 they still respect Argentina in a way 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.630
 although he has not emerged champion although 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.070
 I lost 41 to Germany is a 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.320
 respected team anyone speaks well 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.660
 of Argentina with these players is 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.250
 impossible to speak, although all 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.250
 we agree because it is better 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.909
 it has distinct that no one helps 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.490
 totally free at that speed 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.439
 and that 's impossible the brake he has on 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.880
 the center but it has good seen 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.600
 ever do that but the most 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.600
 pegadito at the foot and 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.770
 but good 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.100
 it's a goal by messi 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.830
 maybe a little unconsciously one 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.260
 he knows that his fort is more maybe already 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.560
 since boy then 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.209
 you already have it inside it was a bit of the 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.610
 duel with the defender each one faces 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.319
 you will see strip will be a product to kill is not 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.730
 a team player surely not not 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:31.409
 we have still had what is the game 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.409
 of team if the project was very good 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.830
 I returned to Maradona we had spoken those 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.830
 previous months 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:43.670
 and a good representative of me spoke 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.980
 throughout that period during those 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.810
 last 23 months I'm analyzing well 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.060
 the situation obviously that is a 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.980
 decision that is not that it cost me much 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.310
 we are talking about one of the great 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.380
 clubs of the world 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.599
 that is beyond my past by rivers 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.670
 did not consider let's say a transmission 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:04.120
 Nothing like that 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:07.330
 I consider the 22 clubs these two 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.400
 clubs but for me for my training 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.160
 as a sportsman very good especially 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.880
 up I 'm going to tell you river because I 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.880
 I grew up 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.580
 it's hard for a fan to understand that 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.680
 then it is difficult I can give a thousand 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.810
 explanations I can give my 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.780
 explanations but nobody is going to 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.340
 understand can you say I did not play 500 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.379
 matches 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.660
 I hope there is a river outgoing from 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:37.060
 river and then to that mouth beyond the 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.519
 seven year period but well I do not 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.269
 I consider it no tradition only 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:45.220
 it's a team that looked for me at that moment 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:48.790
 the project was very good it came back with a 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.019
 player of which I am a friend and was the 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.569
 best player in Munich or if he was the 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.569
 best director player and came back I went back
