 trip mlb preparing this stick for 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.610
 that we put ourselves to the shot 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.559
 before the full return because if not 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:36.700

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.739
 heat and three gloves 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.580
 once 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.190
 have the ingredients to make the 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.740

 a piece of garlic 500 grams of breast 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.789
 of chicken cooked bottom of bird that 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.320
 means what we talked about last time 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:26.649
 caldito so that we do not end this 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.509
 900 grams of rice 2 banana leaves 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:31.240
 this of course are going to be the tamale and 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.610
 Aluminum foil and 6 tablespoons of oil 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.810
 that was what he already put to rice and 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.500
 create bread 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.860
 now 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.500
 we go with the chicken broth when 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.660
 bird 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.660
 it can be exactly water bottom 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:56.270
 we can add and comment a while ago 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.979
 that kind of long or super grain 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.810
 extra too many times we get it to 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.790
 find and good what is really 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.400
 is to add what the fund is going to 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.770
 start to boil it will hydrate the 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.450
 rice and what I also recommend is 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.300
 how good how long it would take us 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.480
 do in this case what seems very 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.840
 exactly but very fast that I do not 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:22.220
 create about 20 minutes when you have 20 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.050
 minutes having the rust is another type 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.820
 another type of trick sorry also that 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.209
 We can teach them what it is since I have 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:32.720
 my cooked rice a day before I leave you 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:36.680
 in the creator they put temperie leftover 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.750
 Quickly find some tamalitos better 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.860
 rice I go up to hands like in this case 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.860
 here the rice 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:50.480
 then what comes 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:53.870
 I made a paste they can not fill to 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.840
 that the camera can take perfect if 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:00.440
 I like chicken I did not make a paste 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:04.190
 of chile takes nuggets takes in the 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:07.100
 Onion the garlic liquefies everything and 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:12.400
 I put the chicken 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.400
 let's put the rice already cooked 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.409
 This will be like a channel 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:20.409
 of the 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.090
 and we are going to fill it 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:37.100
 and good also the intention is the 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.380
 recipe that he invented this for you but 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.760
 they can be those of chicken pork a lot 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.220
 people who do not comment can put 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.569
 vegetable with the same you have actuality 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:50.319
 clear in this case 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:52.239
 hey i wish rice because doing all this 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:54.310

 commented previously of doing 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.499
 comment on good nutrition with 

00:03:56.469 --> 00:04:02.230
 rice to serve with rice 4 red rice 

00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:06.450

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.450
 of how to prepare and make a light 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:20.949
 the compact is not shared exactly 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.830
 what as the stream is cooked by 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:28.539
 that we were very fast but to speak 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:30.220
 of this fact the hotels have a lot 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:32.020
 people what it does is make it the 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.680
 aluminum you get to break sometimes the 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.599
 sheet 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.270
 the aluminum put it like this this part 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:39.520
