 the magazine of sailing and traveling to 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.660
 program this week

 we will continue our cruise on board 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.410
 of recovery with an episode 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.539
 exciting about the configuration of the 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.220
 rigging then we will close our 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:30.079
 stop in bora bora by showing you 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.390

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:34.280
 discover the island but we leave everything 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.260
 immediately to marie galante in the archipelago 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.410
 Caribbean to know everything about the 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.600
 rum making we could not 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.220
 stop at Marie Galante without you 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.950
 unveil all the secrets of the 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.590
 making this famous nectar that has 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.930
 given its name to the rum road and who 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.770
 is intimately linked to the history of the 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.510
 Marine 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.250
 made famous by adventures 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.250
 romance of the great life style 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.410
 she's going we're getting married 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.780
 gallant who is an addiction to the 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.810
 guadeloupe which is a small island which 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.970
 is 15 km in diameter and has 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.490
 currently twelve to thirteen thousand 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.000
 inhabitants who essentially cultivate 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.700
 sugar cane since almost 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.170
 christophe colomb the sugar cane is 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.870
 a monoculture that is 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.690
 traditionally grown in marie 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:39.660
 gallant formerly it was mills 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.330
 Wind that had been imported from the 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.369
 holland i think of culture 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.200
 dutch his windmills he in 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.600
 rest i think about a 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.330
 sixties there were very 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.600
 exactly 106 that was what was called 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.960
 the innocent mill around each of 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.009
 mills lived a small family to 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.080
 the time of slavery 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.450
 there were crews who were 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.800
 around these mills to make this 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.740
 that was called drum syrup 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.229
 that is syrup that were 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.110
 then sent to the metropolis to be 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:17.880
 refined and this syrup was a commodity 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.989
 rare that made the wealth of 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.840
 antilles and french antilles 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.310
 dutch English then went 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.519
 grafted the making of rum 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.440
 some hysterical comics was I think 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.350
 in number of 18 years beginning of the century 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.769
 manufactures agricultural rum so pure juice 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.570
 cane 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.540
 most of them have disappeared 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:39.090
 with the very famous too famous 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.180
 August 28 cyclone where the mills 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.470
 practically have been disheveled is 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.180
 replaced by the steam engine 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.860
 you will find the next two 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.239
 episodes of this series devoted to 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.239
 Roma in our next magazines 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.830
 from rum to old navy there is 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.480
 that not so this tone around the 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.990
 recovery for a small bowl of air 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.990
 breton 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.730
 the 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:35.180
 for impeccable 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.880
 we have nine veil at post we are not going 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.850
 go see everything today because 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.560
 they are not all approved installed 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.940
 we at the brigantine in the back so what 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.580
 another mainsail to us we call it 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.200
 brigantine it's more a term more 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.180
 suitable for this type of rigging 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.830
 especially we normally have at 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.710
 above the brigantine so-called 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.540
 an arrow in the ass that is a sail that 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.520
 is not at post she who is hoisted 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.010
 from the bridge but that is part of the 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:04.550
 standard sail plan let's say to 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:07.460
 in the middle 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.410
 sandstone on the foremast above 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:13.250
 of the foresail we have a voice the dt it's 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:16.820
 a kind of seal placed between the two 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:19.880
 hands to higher one chains on 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:23.650
 the front where we have three sails from before 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:27.140
 staysail a small jib and a large jib 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.580
 so above the foresail we have this 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.350
 which is called a square sail which is 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.270
 online and is normally there is 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.340
 a second one called him 1 so we 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.080
 has a small topsail to use the 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.580
 precise term and above the small 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.340
 winger a little parrot who is not 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.060
 currently approved but who who 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.360
 will find its place 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.830
 soon these nine here are not 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.900
 necessarily all used at the same 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.430
 moment this is all the interest of the rigging 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.320
 the aid is to use one instead 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.360
 than the other according to the lure in 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.040
 according to the strength of the wind it's true 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.110
 that's good it's particularly pretty 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.060
 as we say when we all have it but 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.160
 it's not necessarily the most 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.870
 effective because by definition when 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.360
 we all have it, there are inevitably 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.860
 sails that interferes on others and which 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.960
 she interferes with each other 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.250
 so what does that really allow 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.680
 rigging schooner to topsail it's 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.850
 precisely multiple combinations that 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.070
 will allow us depending on the 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.720
 lure and the strength of the wind but to have 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.880
 a sail plan really suited to 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.470
 each time we will meet again 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.300
 of our cruise aboard the 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.730
 recovery soon on his lines 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.730
 discoveries 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.730
 all 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.600
 finally to close our series cards 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.430
 postcards of bora bora 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.850
 we will leave the boat docked for 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.500
 discover many other aspects of Lille 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:42.330
 as soon as you enter the lagoon you dive 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.280
 already in the photography books to 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:47.990
 incredible blue color of a 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.990
 indefinable transparency 

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:52.660
 a first hotel is at the forefront 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.660
 of montaut 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:59.960
 hotels in bora bora there are some for 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:02.240
 just about all on the same model of 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.310
 shore facilities then docks that 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.759
 overlooks series of lighthouses and 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.759
 feet in the water 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.900
 the center of the small village of wailly taper 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.360
 and mostly occupied by a few shops 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.830
 and the different services allowing 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.840
 tourists who disembark 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:27.300
 liners to rent a car for 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:30.240
 go around the island climb 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:32.190
 Mount Otemanu visit the beautiful 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.950
 archaeological sites buy some 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:36.060
 souvenirs at the craft center or enter 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.580
 in one of the many shops 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:43.800
 offering beautiful school jewelry to 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:46.770
 base of the famous terrenoire to note 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:50.480
 that it is in front of the craft center that 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.480
 is the tomb of the Gironde 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:01.960
 for whoever comes to sail 12 days 

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:04.420
 the archipelago of the company nora deal 

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:06.430
 berra is a must stop and 

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:11.920
 time goes very quickly tries well to 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:13.720
 things to see were aboard a 

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:15.490
 cruising sailboat and navigate in this 

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:18.040
 lagoon with magical waters and transparent 

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:20.970
 to stay away from the fort 

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:23.050
 tourist development of the island 

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:25.300
 a lot of people so they come in 

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:27.490
 polynesia they want to be with 

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:29.710

 they learn more than 

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:43.900
 in hotels all hotels are 

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:47.620
 very good but if he sees that part

 but see you next week 

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:59.850
 so by then a good walk under sail 

00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.850
 of course
