00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
option for NFC and Android Beam so you

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.040

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
so I'll just demo it real quick so if I

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:56.869 
so I'll just demo it real quick so if I
open<00:00:49.320> up<00:00:49.410> Maps<00:00:49.770> I<00:00:51.110> can<00:00:52.110> beam<00:00:53.570> from<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.719> s3<00:00:55.879> to

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
open up Maps I can beam from the s3 to

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.860 
open up Maps I can beam from the s3 to
the<00:00:57.030> s2<00:00:57.859> now<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:58.980> has<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.250> same<00:00:59.399> maps<00:00:59.730> open<00:01:00.210> and

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.630 
of course it works the other way too so
I'll<00:01:04.530> do<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:04.799> from<00:01:04.890> s2<00:01:05.489> this<00:01:05.640> time<00:01:07.430> the<00:01:08.430> past

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
I'll do it from s2 this time the past

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.420 
I'll do it from s2 this time the past
