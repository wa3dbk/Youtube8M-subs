00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.950
 hello girls for the works of 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:08.930
 wickerwork on paper combined 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:13.310
 various colors like the ones we're 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:17.290
 seeing we require that the rods 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:17.290
 are previously painted 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:23.160
 Many have asked me about it 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.170
 I do and in this video I'm going to show you 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.220
 I mostly use paintings 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:33.000
 vinyl and acrylics that are the ones 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.250
 used to paint walls 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.270
 the base of all secondary colors 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.700
 like pink light green colors 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.410
 pastry 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:48.670
 celestial for example is color painting 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.820
 clear, be it white 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:55.780
 cream color and color 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:58.050
 secondary that is the obscure with the 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:02.160
 combination of these 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:05.050
 and diluted in water we will take several 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.560
 tones like these 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:11.190
 and what we must first take in 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:15.030
 account is that if we want light colors 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:19.229
 we have to use the rods 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:23.880
 the whites that result from rolling the 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.640
 strips that have a white border throughout 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.430
 the shore 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.430
 if we start rolling from here 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:37.930
 finally we will have the rod 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:40.960
 white or that of the shore 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:46.260
 these are the ones that I use to 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.260
 paint in light colors the others 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:53.110
 they have lyrics 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:56.110
 in it everything printed on the paper that 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:59.350
 made with these strips that use them 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.409
 more than anything for dark colors 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:06.490
 for example 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:10.330
 of two colors that was chocolate coffee 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:13.239
 and the cream color or the white color yo 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.060
 take three tones but you can take out 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:19.150
 many more according to the proportion that 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.770
 let's say of each painting and water 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:26.890
 we have dark coffee 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:29.920
 It's a pale rose type rosewood 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.740
 and it's a little darker pink 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:37.209
 throwing our first coffee 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:39.550
 combination in this bowl I put a little bit of 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:43.090
 Chocolate coffee painting as you can see 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:47.100
 I'm going to combine it with a dark 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:51.110
 little cream 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:53.440
 more or less equally 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:57.510
 we stir 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.510
 let's see how it is mixing 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:07.490
 Now this mixture is recommended 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:10.960
 put a little water on this so that 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:15.410
 so that the paint is not too thick 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:18.640
 Because when painting with thick paint, 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:22.810
 rods will become very hard 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.810
 brittle and therefore 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:29.109
 difficulty the tissue 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:31.450
 you are going to see the textures that is 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:35.020
 almost liquid 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:39.160
 and I remind you that the darker the 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:41.970
 tone color is because it is easier 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.970
 paint them 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:51.300
 to paint I use a brush 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.140
 medium width 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:57.569
 and I paint in groups 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.500
 from 4 to 5 rods 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:02.020
 this is 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.270
 to be able to turn them around that we do not know 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.000
 no pass 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:11.070
 without painting or that there 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.070
 blank pieces 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.630
 said 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.240
 in equal parts in light color and in 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.680
 dark color because there is one 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.639
 consistency 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:34.120
 that covers it well 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:34.120
 we turn or roll the rods 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.320
 as we see 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.830
 here is one of us who participated here 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.040
 we cover why it's important that we do not 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.529
 be 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:52.169
 let's not paint many at once 

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:56.210
 this is to make sure 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:56.210
 that are completely painted 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:04.759
 As you can see, a very nice rose was left 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:08.270
 a very beautiful tone very different from the red 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:10.150
 that we use combined with white or 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:13.240
 cream 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:17.340
 remember that you always have to look for a 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.340
 almost liquid consistency 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:22.160
 girls I want you to appreciate the coverage 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:24.530
 who has this painting 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:28.120
 for example in those that are 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:32.420
 showing in pink covered perfectly 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:34.120
 because I used the white rods the 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:36.160
 that are left 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.889
 with the strips that the little bank has 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.919
 white those who are higher up as 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:46.350
 you can see if you appreciate a bit of the 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:49.800
 paper newspaper painting but yes 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:51.960
 reaches to cover well 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.270
 these others that I am showing you are 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.889
 those we painted with the first painting 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.910
 with the first paint combination 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:00.580
 we did 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:02.960
 I hope you liked it and especially 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:05.449
 that is useful for you 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.210
 being beautiful works 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:12.729
