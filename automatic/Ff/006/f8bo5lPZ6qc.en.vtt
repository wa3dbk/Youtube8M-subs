00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
video games and I don't find it I can't

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.660 
video games and I don't find it I can't
really<00:01:30.540> stay<00:01:30.960> with<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.320> for<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.560> long<00:01:31.770> time<00:01:32.100> so

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
the sim for a helicopters just hasn't

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.880 
the sim for a helicopters just hasn't
worked<00:01:35.220> very<00:01:35.670> well<00:01:35.729> for<00:01:35.939> me<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.590> decided<00:01:37.590> there

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
worked very well for me I decided there

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.100 
worked very well for me I decided there
must<00:01:38.100> be<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.280> technology<00:01:39.210> solution<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:39.960> could

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
must be a technology solution that could

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.410 
must be a technology solution that could
help<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:41.070> wouldn't<00:01:41.430> break<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.909> bank<00:01:42.119> and

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
help that wouldn't break the bank and

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.260 
help that wouldn't break the bank and
that<00:01:42.479> would<00:01:42.840> work<00:01:43.020> with<00:01:43.200> my<00:01:43.380> dx6i<00:01:44.270> after

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
that would work with my dx6i after

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.240 
that would work with my dx6i after
reviewing<00:01:45.750> all<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.049> forums<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.890> doing<00:01:47.100> other

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
research I settled on the icon

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.880 
research I settled on the icon
I<00:01:49.860> replaced<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.060> rover<00:01:51.479> G<00:01:51.750> 31<00:01:52.290> on<00:01:52.439> my<00:01:52.560> Tarot

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
I replaced the rover G 31 on my Tarot

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.580 
I replaced the rover G 31 on my Tarot
with<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.250> icon<00:01:53.670> attach<00:01:54.509> spectrum<00:01:55.049> satellites

with the icon attach spectrum satellites

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.560 
with the icon attach spectrum satellites
and<00:01:55.799> set<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.130> tail<00:01:56.340> gain<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.939> software

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
and set the tail gain and the software

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.749 
and set the tail gain and the software
to<00:01:57.719> save<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:57.990> channel<00:01:58.530> here's<00:01:59.369> my<00:01:59.549> experience

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
this footage I just kept the helicopter

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.510 
this footage I just kept the helicopter
in<00:03:30.570> the<00:03:30.600> view<00:03:30.900> of<00:03:31.020> the<00:03:31.140> camera<00:03:31.410> so<00:03:32.190> you<00:03:32.280> could

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
in the view of the camera so you could

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.640 
in the view of the camera so you could
see<00:03:32.730> it<00:03:32.850> this<00:03:33.060> whole<00:03:33.330> footage<00:03:33.780> is<00:03:33.930> in<00:03:34.110> self

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
see it this whole footage is in self

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.490 
see it this whole footage is in self
level<00:03:35.070> so<00:03:35.640> what's<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.180> bottom<00:03:36.300> line<00:03:36.570> well<00:03:37.170> I

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
level so what's the bottom line well I

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.260 
level so what's the bottom line well I
enjoy<00:03:38.190> flying<00:03:38.580> more<00:03:38.910> I<00:03:39.150> don't<00:03:39.900> crash<00:03:40.730> and<00:03:41.730> I

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
enjoy flying more I don't crash and I

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.710 
enjoy flying more I don't crash and I
think<00:03:43.170> the<00:03:43.430> icon<00:03:44.430> and<00:03:44.700> self<00:03:44.940> level<00:03:45.390> is<00:03:45.510> a<00:03:45.540> very

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
think the icon and self level is a very

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.040 
think the icon and self level is a very
useful<00:03:46.350> training<00:03:47.090> so<00:03:48.090> I<00:03:48.120> hope<00:03:48.360> this<00:03:48.510> video<00:03:48.720> is

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
useful training so I hope this video is

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.970 
useful training so I hope this video is
helpful<00:03:49.080> to<00:03:49.470> you<00:03:49.560> thanks<00:03:50.520> very<00:03:50.550> much
