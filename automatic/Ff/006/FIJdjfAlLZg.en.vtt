book this year it's a really nice

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.729 
book this year it's a really nice
addition<00:00:57.329> in<00:00:57.719> my<00:00:57.809> opinion<00:00:58.199> in<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.440> play<00:00:58.620> that

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
addition in my opinion in the play that

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.590 
addition in my opinion in the play that
we're<00:00:58.829> gonna<00:00:58.920> be<00:00:59.070> using<00:00:59.280> is<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.699> Saints<00:01:00.120> drive

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
we're gonna be using is the Saints drive

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.020 
we're gonna be using is the Saints drive
out<00:01:00.870> this<00:01:01.800> play<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.160> very<00:01:02.190> similar<00:01:02.609> to<00:01:02.730> the

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
out this play is very similar to the

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.359 
out this play is very similar to the
zona<00:01:03.300> post<00:01:03.690> in<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.049> shotgun<00:01:04.290> tight<00:01:05.100> in

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
zona post in the shotgun tight in

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.520 
zona post in the shotgun tight in
Arizona's<00:01:05.880> playbook<00:01:06.240> but<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.869> difference<00:01:07.380> is

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
Arizona's playbook but the difference is

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.320 
Arizona's playbook but the difference is
that<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.010> running<00:01:08.430> back<00:01:08.549> is<00:01:08.580> actually<00:01:09.150> offset

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
that the running back is actually offset

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.330 
that the running back is actually offset
which<00:01:10.080> makes<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.560> much<00:01:10.740> better<00:01:10.950> running

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
which makes it a much better running

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.780 
which makes it a much better running
option<00:01:11.790> as<00:01:12.360> well<00:01:13.189> alright<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:14.250> what<00:01:14.549> we<00:01:14.640> want

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
option as well alright so what we want

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.109 
option as well alright so what we want
to<00:01:14.850> do<00:01:15.000> here<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:16.200> we<00:01:16.350> want<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.590> bring<00:01:16.770> our<00:01:17.610> far

left<00:01:18.330> receiver<00:01:18.689> over<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.259> then<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.100> only

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
left receiver over and then the only

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.679 
left receiver over and then the only
other<00:01:20.310> thing<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.700> we<00:01:20.850> really<00:01:21.090> need<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.360> do<00:01:21.509> is

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689

we want to put our running back on a
streak<00:01:23.250> pattern<00:01:23.640> that's<00:01:24.150> all<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.509> hot<00:01:24.659> rods

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
streak pattern that's all the hot rods

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.030 
streak pattern that's all the hot rods
we<00:01:24.960> have<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.200> do<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.409> this<00:01:25.500> play<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.799> make<00:01:25.979> it

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
we have to do to this play to make it

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.670 
we have to do to this play to make it
effective<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.909> first<00:01:27.210> read<00:01:27.570> on<00:01:27.840> this<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.259> it's

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
effective the first read on this is it's

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.289 
effective the first read on this is it's
the<00:01:28.770> square<00:01:29.130> receiver<00:01:29.520> as<00:01:29.700> he<00:01:29.820> cuts<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.210> the

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
the square receiver as he cuts to the

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.390 
the square receiver as he cuts to the
outside<00:01:30.720> or<00:01:31.110> excuse<00:01:31.710> me<00:01:31.770> as<00:01:31.920> he<00:01:31.979> cuts<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.310> the

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
outside or excuse me as he cuts to the

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.440 
outside or excuse me as he cuts to the
inside<00:01:32.430> he's<00:01:32.820> gonna<00:01:32.939> get<00:01:33.119> some<00:01:33.240> separation

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
inside he's gonna get some separation

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.990 
inside he's gonna get some separation
dragging<00:01:34.229> across<00:01:34.500> it<00:01:35.310> makes<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.640> really<00:01:35.820> nice

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
dragging across it makes a really nice

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.210 
dragging across it makes a really nice
pattern<00:01:36.420> concept<00:01:37.409> because<00:01:37.619> it's<00:01:37.770> basically

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
pattern concept because it's basically

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.020 
pattern concept because it's basically
three<00:01:38.909> different<00:01:38.990> in<00:01:39.990> routes<00:01:40.290> here<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:41.030> here

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
three different in routes here and here

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.770 
three different in routes here and here

and<00:03:10.890> it's<00:03:11.280> basically<00:03:11.520> a<00:03:11.790> lob<00:03:12.090> ball<00:03:12.420> against

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
and it's basically a lob ball against

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.870 
and it's basically a lob ball against
man<00:03:12.930> in<00:03:13.560> a<00:03:13.680> situation<00:03:14.280> where<00:03:14.460> they<00:03:14.550> may<00:03:14.670> take

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
man in a situation where they may take

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.300 
man in a situation where they may take
the<00:03:15.000> safety<00:03:15.420> way<00:03:15.630> or<00:03:15.990> or<00:03:16.770> you<00:03:16.920> just<00:03:17.040> want<00:03:17.250> to

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
the safety way or or you just want to

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.770 
the safety way or or you just want to
try<00:03:17.460> your<00:03:17.580> chances<00:03:18.120> at<00:03:18.240> the<00:03:18.330> end<00:03:18.450> of<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.600> half

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
try your chances at the end of the half

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.040 
try your chances at the end of the half
this<00:03:19.560> is<00:03:19.620> a<00:03:19.770> nice<00:03:20.040> route<00:03:20.340> just<00:03:21.120> lob<00:03:21.420> it<00:03:21.600> up<00:03:21.750> and

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
this is a nice route just lob it up and

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.420 
this is a nice route just lob it up and
then<00:03:22.440> you're<00:03:22.530> just<00:03:22.590> going<00:03:22.740> to<00:03:22.830> click<00:03:23.040> on<00:03:23.160> to

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
then you're just going to click on to

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.910 
then you're just going to click on to
him<00:03:23.520> and<00:03:23.640> swerve<00:03:23.970> him<00:03:24.180> a<00:03:24.240> little<00:03:24.480> bit<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:24.920> try

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
him and swerve him a little bit and try

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.020 
him and swerve him a little bit and try
to<00:03:25.980> get<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:26.220> user<00:03:26.400> catch<00:03:26.640> here<00:03:26.850> we're<00:03:26.970> not

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
to get the user catch here we're not

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.180 
to get the user catch here we're not
getting<00:03:27.330> a<00:03:27.360> really<00:03:27.510> good<00:03:27.720> animation<00:03:28.290> but<00:03:28.470> but

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
getting a really good animation but but

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.180 
getting a really good animation but but
hopefully<00:03:30.470> you'll<00:03:31.470> work<00:03:31.710> on<00:03:31.860> this<00:03:31.980> a<00:03:32.040> little

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
hopefully you'll work on this a little

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.650 
hopefully you'll work on this a little
bit<00:03:32.370> in<00:03:32.430> practice<00:03:32.580> mode<00:03:32.970> and<00:03:33.240> you<00:03:33.330> can<00:03:33.480> see

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
bit in practice mode and you can see

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:34.580 
bit in practice mode and you can see
what<00:03:33.750> I'm<00:03:33.840> talking<00:03:34.080> about<00:03:34.140> here<00:03:34.350> we're<00:03:34.470> gonna

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
what I'm talking about here we're gonna

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.930 
what I'm talking about here we're gonna
try<00:03:34.800> to<00:03:34.830> take<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.100> safety<00:03:35.310> away<00:03:35.610> and<00:03:35.730> show<00:03:35.880> you

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
try to take the safety away and show you

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.020 
try to take the safety away and show you
what<00:03:36.120> happens<00:03:36.510> basically<00:03:37.170> you<00:03:38.070> just<00:03:38.100> you<00:03:38.850> see

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
what happens basically you just you see

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
how you can swerve him and then cut it

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.080 
how you can swerve him and then cut it
off<00:03:40.860> you<00:03:41.070> don't<00:03:41.130> want<00:03:41.340> to<00:03:41.400> love<00:03:41.610> it<00:03:41.640> and<00:03:42.030> you

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
off you don't want to love it and you

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.280 
off you don't want to love it and you
don't<00:03:42.209> want<00:03:42.300> to<00:03:42.450> bullet<00:03:42.750> it<00:03:42.840> you<00:03:42.959> just<00:03:43.110> want<00:03:43.230> to

don't want to bullet it you just want to
put<00:03:43.440> a<00:03:43.470> little<00:03:43.650> bit<00:03:43.800> of<00:03:43.890> touch<00:03:44.070> on<00:03:44.250> it<00:03:44.430> and<00:03:44.970> try

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
put a little bit of touch on it and try

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.550 
put a little bit of touch on it and try
to<00:03:45.510> get<00:03:45.690> here<00:03:45.900> well<00:03:46.020> show<00:03:46.140> you<00:03:46.230> what<00:03:46.320> happens

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
to get here well show you what happens

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.560 
to get here well show you what happens
with<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:46.770> safety<00:03:47.130> and<00:03:47.730> with<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:48.030> safety<00:03:48.420> it's

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
with the safety and with the safety it's

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.180 
with the safety and with the safety it's
a<00:03:48.750> little<00:03:49.050> bit<00:03:49.170> dicey<00:03:49.350> err<00:03:49.620> but<00:03:49.740> there<00:03:49.950> you<00:03:50.010> see

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
a little bit dicey err but there you see

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.400 
a little bit dicey err but there you see
and<00:03:50.400> you<00:03:50.459> know<00:03:50.580> no<00:03:50.790> pass<00:03:51.030> lead<00:03:51.300> no<00:03:51.780> passing<00:03:52.290> on

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
and you know no pass lead no passing on

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.710 
and you know no pass lead no passing on
this<00:03:52.670> the<00:03:53.670> reason<00:03:53.820> we<00:03:54.030> don't<00:03:54.120> use<00:03:54.240> passes

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
this the reason we don't use passes

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.690 
this the reason we don't use passes
because<00:03:54.930> we<00:03:55.140> don't<00:03:55.290> want<00:03:55.410> to<00:03:55.470> obviously<00:03:55.700> it

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
because we don't want to obviously it

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.250 
because we don't want to obviously it
changes<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.209> way<00:03:57.330> that<00:03:57.480> they<00:03:57.570> play<00:03:57.900> the<00:03:58.110> route

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
changes the way that they play the route

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.500 
changes the way that they play the route
but<00:03:58.770> we<00:03:58.950> get<00:03:59.070> nicer<00:03:59.490> animations<00:04:00.000> with<00:04:00.150> no<00:04:00.270> path

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
but we get nicer animations with no path

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.630 
but we get nicer animations with no path
lead<00:04:00.750> in<00:04:00.870> my<00:04:00.990> opinion<00:04:01.410> and<00:04:02.070> so<00:04:02.100> that's<00:04:02.430> what<00:04:02.550> we

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
lead in my opinion and so that's what we

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.740 
lead in my opinion and so that's what we
want<00:04:02.790> to<00:04:02.850> do<00:04:02.910> that<00:04:03.060> real<00:04:03.270> quick<00:04:03.480> I<00:04:03.540> want<00:04:03.690> to

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
want to do that real quick I want to

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.810 
want to do that real quick I want to

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
show you a cover to zone just an option

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.699 
show you a cover to zone just an option
against<00:04:06.300> the<00:04:06.390> cover<00:04:06.540> to<00:04:06.690> zone<00:04:06.900> with<00:04:07.380> the<00:04:07.500> same

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
against the cover to zone with the same

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.420 
against the cover to zone with the same
hot<00:04:08.010> rest<00:04:08.250> that<00:04:08.400> we're<00:04:08.520> doing<00:04:08.700> and<00:04:10.250> the<00:04:11.250> route

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
hot rest that we're doing and the route

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.949 
hot rest that we're doing and the route
that<00:04:11.580> we<00:04:11.670> really<00:04:11.910> want<00:04:12.060> to<00:04:12.120> stress<00:04:12.600> is<00:04:12.810> this

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
that we really want to stress is this

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.060 
that we really want to stress is this
running<00:04:13.230> background<00:04:13.470> out<00:04:13.770> of<00:04:13.800> the<00:04:13.920> backfield

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
running background out of the backfield

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.280 
running background out of the backfield
it<00:04:14.850> does<00:04:15.000> a<00:04:15.030> nice<00:04:15.270> job<00:04:15.330> it's<00:04:15.990> sitting

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
it does a nice job it's sitting

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.410 
it does a nice job it's sitting
underneath<00:04:16.530> the<00:04:16.770> zones<00:04:17.010> and<00:04:17.340> if<00:04:17.970> he<00:04:18.060> has<00:04:18.180> you

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:18.420 
underneath the zones and if he has you

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:19.970 
underneath the zones and if he has you
know<00:04:18.510> good<00:04:18.690> trucking<00:04:19.109> or<00:04:19.200> whatever<00:04:19.440> then

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
know good trucking or whatever then

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.730 
know good trucking or whatever then
maybe<00:04:20.580> he<00:04:20.760> can<00:04:20.940> get<00:04:21.090> off<00:04:21.239> off<00:04:21.930> for<00:04:22.290> the<00:04:22.350> races

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
maybe he can get off off for the races

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.290 
maybe he can get off off for the races
and<00:04:22.860> then<00:04:23.280> the<00:04:23.370> final<00:04:23.700> play<00:04:23.850> I<00:04:23.880> want<00:04:24.090> to<00:04:24.150> show

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
and then the final play I want to show

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.000 
and then the final play I want to show
you<00:04:24.360> works<00:04:25.140> well<00:04:25.560> off<00:04:25.800> of<00:04:25.979> this<00:04:26.070> is<00:04:26.340> the<00:04:26.460> inside
