00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
hope that i can take it further than

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.100 
hope that i can take it further than
just<00:03:41.560> while<00:03:42.490> being<00:03:42.730> on<00:03:42.970> the<00:03:43.120> rock<00:03:43.300> i<00:03:43.600> can<00:03:43.780> hope

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110

just while being on the rock i can hope
i<00:03:44.290> can<00:03:44.320> do<00:03:44.650> that<00:03:44.680> with<00:03:46.950> my<00:03:47.950> other<00:03:48.280> ways<00:03:48.610> of

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
i can do that with my other ways of

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.720 
i can do that with my other ways of
thinking<00:03:49.120> that<00:03:50.020> hold<00:03:50.290> me<00:03:50.440> back<00:03:50.650> but<00:03:51.310> for<00:03:51.580> me
