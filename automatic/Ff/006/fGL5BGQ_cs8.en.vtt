00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.470
 then now instead we will make the donuts 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.960
 I'll show you what we need 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:18.840
 the potato bridles will serve us half 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.529
 kilo of potatoes you take the weight from 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:26.820
 with raw potatoes with lele peel 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:31.020
 we are the poking then we sift 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.950
 we have onion g of butter a pinch of 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:37.050
 salt 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:39.989
 a cube of yeast an egg e 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.090
 about 300 g of flour the flour which 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.030
 take it I pamper you more or less 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.980
 300 grams then we see together if any 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.870
 will serve more or less 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:57.890
 let's duty then the butter 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:01:03.300
 pieces of butter at room temperature 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:05.430
 brewer's yeast crumbled with heat 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.130
 some potato balls must be falling 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.820
 with the heat of the parades it will melt 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.969
 both butter and brewer's yeast 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.810
 because here there is no water in this 

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:22.140
 recipe does not go to that bastiano we work 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.270
 well until yesterday and the butter 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.619
 they will be amalgamated amalgamated 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.630
 completely with potatoes when it's pure 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:37.409
 yeast will be well blended 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:41.219
 we incorporate the flour we put a little 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:46.909
 at a time that should not happen 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:49.950
 serve all the dough should be 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:52.460
 quite dull and soft like that 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.460
 of gnocchi 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:14.310
 we also put the new in this 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:18.760
 case the 300 g of flour passed there 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.310
 double zero of course for 500 g of 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:25.980
 potatoes 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.980
 now let's go to make the donuts 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:40.780
 then let's see a piece roll up 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:44.370
 we supply a not too big loaf 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.370
 because then these will have to rise 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.459
 the twins 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.170
 the donuts will have to rise for 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.150
 at least half an hour we don't do them 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.700
 rise a lot because otherwise yes 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.069
 they will clean once leavened 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.990
 donuts have become the double le 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:28.990
 we fry in abundant oil 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:54.520
 when they are well golden we return them and 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.520
 leaves muscle on absorbent paper 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:02.420
 when the donuts are still the cause 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:08.620
 we take them from the sugar 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:08.620
 caster and we arrange them on the bottom 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:22.160
 here is our story ciambelline di 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.160
 potatoes 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:29.610
 good appetite to all I hope that too 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.110
 this time we liked the idea 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.440
 see you next time 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.440
 Hello
