other games that's in this but it seems
to<00:03:28.410> be<00:03:28.500> quite<00:03:28.650> unique<00:03:29.040> that's<00:03:29.940> the<00:03:30.120> other

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
to be quite unique that's the other

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.390 
to be quite unique that's the other
thing<00:03:30.300> so<00:03:30.630> quality<00:03:31.200> but<00:03:31.440> also<00:03:31.470> uniqueness<00:03:32.250> it

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
thing so quality but also uniqueness it

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.160 
thing so quality but also uniqueness it
it's<00:03:32.670> gonna<00:03:32.940> be<00:03:33.120> you<00:03:33.810> know<00:03:33.930> if<00:03:33.989> it's<00:03:34.140> a

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
that sees a wait let's go use it was

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.219 
that sees a wait let's go use it was
grim

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:33.050 

okay<00:04:31.250> okay<00:04:32.250> start<00:04:32.669> to<00:04:32.759> get<00:04:32.850> bit<00:04:32.940> more

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
okay okay start to get bit more

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.430 
okay okay start to get bit more
complicated<00:04:33.300> now<00:04:33.539> what's<00:04:33.810> that<00:04:33.960> tree<00:04:34.199> thing

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
complicated now what's that tree thing

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.529 
complicated now what's that tree thing
over<00:04:34.650> there<00:04:34.830> oh<00:04:35.009> I<00:04:35.460> see<00:04:35.819> okay<00:04:35.940> so<00:04:36.120> you<00:04:36.300> can<00:04:36.419> use

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:36.539 
over there oh I see okay so you can use

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:38.990 
over there oh I see okay so you can use
both<00:04:37.139> of<00:04:37.199> them<00:04:37.410> at<00:04:37.470> the<00:04:37.530> same<00:04:37.620> time<00:04:38.000> that's

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
both of them at the same time that's

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.150 
both of them at the same time that's
that's<00:04:39.660> pretty<00:04:39.840> cool<00:04:39.960> so<00:04:40.500> I<00:04:40.530> guess<00:04:40.770> I<00:04:40.949> guess

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
that's pretty cool so I guess I guess

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.650 
that's pretty cool so I guess I guess
one<00:04:41.340> tactic<00:04:41.789> here<00:04:42.030> would<00:04:42.180> be<00:04:42.270> to<00:04:44.389> bounce<00:04:45.389> your

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
one tactic here would be to bounce your

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.920 
one tactic here would be to bounce your
persons<00:04:46.699> cuz<00:04:47.699> they<00:04:47.819> they<00:04:47.849> attack<00:04:48.300> you<00:04:48.449> back<00:04:48.630> no

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
persons cuz they they attack you back no

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.540 
persons cuz they they attack you back no
they<00:04:49.080> know<00:04:49.349> oh<00:04:49.979> yeah<00:04:52.130> they<00:04:53.130> attacked<00:04:53.460> me

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
they know oh yeah they attacked me

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.279 
they know oh yeah they attacked me
earlier<00:04:53.880> I<00:04:54.180> think<00:04:54.509> if<00:04:54.690> you<00:04:54.780> could<00:04:54.900> put<00:04:55.080> hide

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
earlier I think if you could put hide

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:57.249 
earlier I think if you could put hide
him<00:04:55.440> behind<00:04:55.770> something<00:04:56.069> that'd<00:04:56.310> be<00:04:56.430> handy

00:04:57.249 --> 00:04:57.259 
him behind something that'd be handy

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:00.650 
him behind something that'd be handy
okay<00:04:58.259> so<00:04:58.680> there<00:04:58.889> goes<00:04:59.039> the<00:04:59.280> worst<00:05:00.000> grunt

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
okay so there goes the worst grunt

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.810 
okay so there goes the worst grunt
although<00:05:01.110> the<00:05:01.349> tree<00:05:01.560> got<00:05:01.770> him<00:05:01.949> so<00:05:02.340> is<00:05:02.759> that

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
although the tree got him so is that

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.999 
although the tree got him so is that
because<00:05:03.240> he<00:05:03.330> was<00:05:03.449> close<00:05:03.630> maybe<00:05:04.560> maybe<00:05:04.860> it

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:05.009 
because he was close maybe maybe it

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:06.170 
because he was close maybe maybe it
maybe<00:05:05.190> it<00:05:05.310> was<00:05:05.400> because<00:05:05.580> he's<00:05:05.820> really<00:05:06.090> close

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
maybe it was because he's really close

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.230 
maybe it was because he's really close
to<00:05:06.330> the<00:05:06.449> trailer<00:05:06.660> though<00:05:07.550> so<00:05:08.550> this<00:05:08.970> game<00:05:09.210> is

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
to the trailer though so this game is

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.080 
to the trailer though so this game is
only<00:05:09.810> now<00:05:10.139> it's<00:05:10.440> only<00:05:10.590> way<00:05:10.860> that<00:05:11.009> most<00:05:11.820> gaming

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
only now it's only way that most gaming

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.909 
only now it's only way that most gaming
companies<00:05:12.479> work<00:05:12.690> is<00:05:12.870> they<00:05:13.020> this<00:05:13.500> is<00:05:13.560> in<00:05:13.740> beta

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 
companies work is they this is in beta

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:16.189 
companies work is they this is in beta
test<00:05:14.310> okay<00:05:14.610> so<00:05:14.669> it's<00:05:14.910> not<00:05:14.940> the<00:05:15.270> final<00:05:15.660> game<00:05:15.840> yet

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 
test okay so it's not the final game yet

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:20.240 
test okay so it's not the final game yet
and<00:05:17.159> they<00:05:17.250> always<00:05:17.460> be<00:05:17.759> to<00:05:17.909> test<00:05:18.150> in<00:05:18.830> in<00:05:19.830> Canada

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
and they always be to test in in Canada

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.890 
and they always be to test in in Canada
strangely<00:05:20.970> I<00:05:21.000> think<00:05:21.240> it's<00:05:21.360> because<00:05:21.509> it's<00:05:21.659> very

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
strangely I think it's because it's very

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.529 
strangely I think it's because it's very
similar<00:05:22.169> to<00:05:22.289> North<00:05:23.099> you<00:05:23.370> know<00:05:23.460> to<00:05:23.520> the<00:05:23.699> US<00:05:23.940> and

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:24.539 
similar to North you know to the US and

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:26.210 
similar to North you know to the US and
it's<00:05:24.720> in<00:05:24.810> North<00:05:24.990> America<00:05:25.409> which<00:05:25.889> is<00:05:25.979> where<00:05:26.039> the

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
it's in North America which is where the

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.120 
it's in North America which is where the
beast<00:05:26.400> market<00:05:26.789> as<00:05:26.849> I<00:05:26.880> suppose<00:05:27.150> and<00:05:27.889> so<00:05:28.889> you<00:05:28.979> can

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
beast market as I suppose and so you can

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.439 
beast market as I suppose and so you can
only<00:05:29.190> get<00:05:29.430> this<00:05:29.550> from<00:05:29.759> the<00:05:29.849> Canadian<00:05:30.330> App

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:30.449 
only get this from the Canadian App
