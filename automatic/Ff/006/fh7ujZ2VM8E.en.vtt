00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:08.059
 hello everyone today we will be studying 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.879
 tune the carburetor as I show 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:11.959
 the easiest way 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:12.919
 first quick way then 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:16.550
 quality method 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:18.620
 so look here moped worked then 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:23.030
 he already has exactly two thousand 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:25.490
 turns we put up and the moped warmed up 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:27.200
 not very hot when it should be 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.510
 well heated as if to 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.200
 regulate how it is like we are for 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:35.780
 lack of time then we will 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.800
 tune it high and so here this 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.560
 screw 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.650
 meme quality mix 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.690
 you see 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.850
 on quick setup that is well 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.680
 moped or look at someone trying 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.880
 as if plus or minus and 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.490
 make this chip finished 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.820
 yet not fully close did not prolong 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:01:00.310
 pull to the end they answer almost 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:03.150
 would cause agree to two turns date 1 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.620
 up to 50 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.590
 quick setup 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:10.570
 everything 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:13.560
 but pit works running runs gazing 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.560
 with a sharp gas 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.910
 pro kazal it is all right it is for 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.000
 quick setting is called 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:29.410
 now my quality setting 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.410
 turns over more revolutions gives 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.520
 big beard 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.369
 and mixture quality 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.079
 Nikulin and listens to momentum that is us 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.140
 need to shoot when momentum to be 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:43.140
 maximum more than it is now 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.140
 are listening 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.280
 unscrew the opposite and you know us 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.520
 need to twist 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.490
 we twist 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.940
 raise 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.040
 but promises 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.760
 legs strong turns 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.760
 give further 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.980
 don't give back a bit just were 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.060
 most will 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.720
 Here are the most powerful momentum 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.940
 now we slow down we turn down 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:16.160
 slow down call to normal operation 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:18.380
 to not only jump momentum so we 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.790
 Now there is no normal even greater 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.790
 you can give a little less momentum 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.580
 there see see 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.710
 turnovers do not jump 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.130
 for winter it is a normal turnover that is 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.780
 slightly overpriced 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.780
 for the summer, normal one and a half thousand 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.480
 and so would you see the carburetor setting 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.540
 wish good luck when setting up your 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.459
 carburetor but again I will say that 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.950
 tuned to a hot engine then 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.200
 have a ride for 10-15 minutes ride on 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.849
 heat it and then please 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.930
 set up speed everyone thanks 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:04.420
 subscribe to my channel put 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.420
 likes and with you was Andrei all bye
