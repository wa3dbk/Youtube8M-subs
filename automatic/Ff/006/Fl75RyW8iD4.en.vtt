and and put that into the wooden dowels

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.910 
and and put that into the wooden dowels
Wow<00:02:49.730> and<00:02:50.000> then<00:02:50.150> allow<00:02:50.510> that<00:02:50.570> tissue<00:02:51.380> culture

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
Wow and then allow that tissue culture

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.449 
Wow and then allow that tissue culture
to<00:02:52.190> colonize<00:02:52.970> the<00:02:53.780> dowels<00:02:54.200> so<00:02:54.500> each<00:02:55.100> one<00:02:55.370> of

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
to colonize the dowels so each one of

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.790 
to colonize the dowels so each one of
these<00:02:55.550> dowels<00:02:56.090> is<00:02:56.330> like<00:02:56.540> a<00:02:56.570> miniature<00:02:56.989> reishi

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
these dowels is like a miniature reishi

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.979 
these dowels is like a miniature reishi
log<00:02:58.280> and<00:02:58.670> then<00:02:59.060> what<00:02:59.180> you're<00:02:59.360> doing<00:02:59.690> with<00:02:59.870> the

kit is you're taking these little wooden
dowels<00:03:02.660> or<00:03:03.100> miniature<00:03:04.100> reishi<00:03:04.700> logs<00:03:05.060> and<00:03:05.360> then

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
dowels or miniature reishi logs and then

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.790 
dowels or miniature reishi logs and then
you're<00:03:07.450> drilling<00:03:08.450> holes<00:03:08.690> in<00:03:08.900> a<00:03:08.989> real<00:03:09.200> log<00:03:09.440> and

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
you're drilling holes in a real log and

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.949 
you're drilling holes in a real log and
your<00:03:10.070> pound<00:03:10.340> tapping<00:03:11.180> these<00:03:11.330> into<00:03:11.630> the<00:03:11.750> holes

your your logs from from the tree you

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.710 
your your logs from from the tree you
can<00:03:54.350> do<00:03:54.470> that<00:03:54.680> or<00:03:54.920> you<00:03:55.100> can<00:03:55.250> use<00:03:55.400> a<00:03:55.430> stump<00:03:55.850> and

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
can do that or you can use a stump and

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.660 
can do that or you can use a stump and
you<00:03:56.840> can<00:03:56.989> use<00:03:57.110> the<00:03:57.260> stump<00:03:57.560> as<00:03:57.799> well<00:03:58.220> to<00:03:58.549> grow

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
you can use the stump as well to grow

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.710 
you can use the stump as well to grow

so<00:04:05.660> once<00:04:06.380> you<00:04:06.670> drill<00:04:07.670> bit<00:04:07.880> the<00:04:08.150> the<00:04:08.840> log<00:04:09.079> what's

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
so once you drill bit the the log what's

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.140 
so once you drill bit the the log what's
next<00:04:10.040> you<00:04:10.100> put<00:04:10.130> those<00:04:10.370> spores<00:04:10.700> in<00:04:10.910> and<00:04:11.060> then

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
next you put those spores in and then

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.250 
next you put those spores in and then
weigh<00:04:11.299> right<00:04:11.540> you're<00:04:11.720> going<00:04:11.810> to<00:04:11.900> tap<00:04:12.079> the

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
weigh right you're going to tap the

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.370 
weigh right you're going to tap the
spores<00:04:12.590> into<00:04:13.250> the<00:04:13.579> holes<00:04:14.090> okay<00:04:15.049> and<00:04:15.290> then

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
spores into the holes okay and then

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.630 
spores into the holes okay and then
you're<00:04:15.500> going<00:04:15.590> to<00:04:15.680> seal<00:04:15.890> the<00:04:16.010> holes<00:04:16.190> with<00:04:16.340> wax

stuff well there's an incubation period
on<00:04:57.349> a<00:04:57.380> log<00:04:57.680> ok<00:04:58.370> once<00:04:58.940> you<00:04:59.120> inoculate<00:04:59.690> that<00:04:59.870> log

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
on a log ok once you inoculate that log

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:01.540 
on a log ok once you inoculate that log
that<00:05:00.590> log<00:05:00.800> has<00:05:01.009> to<00:05:01.130> go<00:05:01.250> through<00:05:01.520> a

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
that log has to go through a

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.029 
that log has to go through a
colonization<00:05:02.539> process<00:05:03.259> or<00:05:03.530> an<00:05:03.620> incubation

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:04.039 
colonization process or an incubation

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:06.820 
colonization process or an incubation
period<00:05:04.669> of<00:05:04.810> generally<00:05:05.810> about<00:05:06.050> between<00:05:06.380> six

months to eight months okay but after

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:11.080 
months to eight months okay but after
that<00:05:10.099> that<00:05:10.340> log<00:05:10.550> is<00:05:10.699> going<00:05:10.820> to<00:05:10.910> produce

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
that that log is going to produce

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.570 
that that log is going to produce
mushrooms<00:05:11.479> four<00:05:12.139> to<00:05:12.229> five<00:05:12.410> times<00:05:12.680> a<00:05:12.830> year<00:05:12.860> up
