started<00:00:58.440> with<00:00:58.590> 45<00:00:59.539> Mbps<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:01.410> then<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.809> started

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
started with 45 Mbps and then it started

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.320 
started with 45 Mbps and then it started
going<00:01:04.140> down<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:05.010> 44<00:01:05.780> 35.2<00:01:06.780> 6<00:01:07.020> Mbps<00:01:07.710> 27<00:01:08.430> at<00:01:09.060> one

point went to 27 right now latest study
1.06<00:01:15.000> Mbps<00:01:16.280> so<00:01:17.280> overall<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.909> can<00:01:18.090> say<00:01:18.420> it's

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
1.06 Mbps so overall you can say it's

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.999 
1.06 Mbps so overall you can say it's
around<00:01:18.869> 35<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:20.130> 40<00:01:20.640> Mbps<00:01:21.450> on<00:01:21.689> average<00:01:22.259> if<00:01:22.500> you

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
around 35 to 40 Mbps on average if you

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.490 
around 35 to 40 Mbps on average if you
talk<00:01:23.189> about<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.520> upload<00:01:23.909> speeds<00:01:24.270> they<00:01:25.259> range

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
talk about the upload speeds they range

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.660 
talk about the upload speeds they range
from<00:01:25.650> 5<00:01:26.580> Mbps<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.900> 7<00:01:28.650> Mbps<00:01:29.159> five<00:01:29.400> point<00:01:29.640> nine

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
five five point six four seven Mbps was

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.690 
five five point six four seven Mbps was
the<00:01:32.820> max<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.390> could<00:01:33.750> get<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.369> around<00:01:35.369> four

the max I could get and around four

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.460 
the max I could get and around four
point<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.600> was<00:01:37.290> lowest<00:01:37.829> I<00:01:38.009> could<00:01:38.340> get<00:01:39.140> the<00:01:40.140> ping

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
point it was lowest I could get the ping

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.389 
point it was lowest I could get the ping
speeds<00:01:41.270> you<00:01:42.270> can<00:01:42.299> see<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.689> ping<00:01:42.869> speed<00:01:43.399> 4849

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
speeds you can see the ping speed 4849

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.980 
speeds you can see the ping speed 4849
and<00:01:46.159> overall<00:01:47.159> it's<00:01:47.430> really<00:01:47.610> nice<00:01:48.240> for<00:01:48.540> the
