00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
you can spend in advanced warfare at the

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.780 
you can spend in advanced warfare at the
moment<00:01:49.409> because<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:49.979> bet<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.369> could<00:01:50.490> spend<00:01:50.670> at

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
moment because I bet you could spend at

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.679 
moment because I bet you could spend at
least<00:01:50.880> like<00:01:52.130> $250<00:01:53.130> on<00:01:53.250> DLC<00:01:53.700> alone<00:01:53.939> maybe<00:01:54.509> not

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
least like $250 on DLC alone maybe not

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.749 
least like $250 on DLC alone maybe not
that<00:01:54.810> much<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.409> could<00:01:55.590> double<00:01:55.979> or<00:01:56.100> triple<00:01:56.399> the

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
that much you could double or triple the

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.389 
that much you could double or triple the
value<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.270> game<00:01:57.479> just<00:01:57.750> in<00:01:57.960> DLC<00:01:58.740> alone<00:01:59.040> and

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
value of the game just in DLC alone and

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.280 
value of the game just in DLC alone and
I<00:01:59.579> hope<00:01:59.880> it<00:02:00.000> doesn't<00:02:00.180> become<00:02:00.570> like<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:01.079> have
