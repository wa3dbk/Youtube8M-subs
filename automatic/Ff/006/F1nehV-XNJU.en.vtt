things down if you want to but the best

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.890 
things down if you want to but the best
way<00:02:43.800> is<00:02:43.860> to<00:02:43.950> go<00:02:44.130> in<00:02:44.250> your<00:02:44.430> drill<00:02:44.760> now<00:02:45.390> you<00:02:45.720> keep

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
way is to go in your drill now you keep

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.770 
way is to go in your drill now you keep
it<00:02:46.050> user<00:02:46.230> bamboo<00:02:46.709> and<00:02:47.300> you<00:02:48.300> just<00:02:48.510> literally

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
it user bamboo and you just literally

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.110 
it user bamboo and you just literally
place<00:02:49.110> your<00:02:49.320> bamboo<00:02:49.680> into<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:50.700> soil

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
place your bamboo into the soil

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.540 
place your bamboo into the soil
like<00:02:51.780> so

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
like so

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.690 
like so
and<00:02:53.790> you<00:02:54.300> will<00:02:54.450> have<00:02:54.570> a<00:02:54.600> nice<00:02:54.920> drill<00:02:55.920> like<00:02:56.130> that

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
and you will have a nice drill like that

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.840 
and you will have a nice drill like that
so<00:02:57.420> you<00:02:57.480> just<00:02:57.720> sprinkle<00:02:58.140> your<00:02:58.410> seeds<00:02:58.650> in<00:02:58.860> or

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
so you just sprinkle your seeds in or

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.210 
so you just sprinkle your seeds in or
alternatively<00:03:00.690> you<00:03:01.380> could<00:03:01.560> use<00:03:01.830> something

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
alternatively you could use something

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.290 
alternatively you could use something
like<00:03:02.610> this<00:03:02.940> Big<00:03:03.540> Dipper<00:03:04.040> and<00:03:05.040> you<00:03:05.520> just<00:03:05.730> break

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
like this Big Dipper and you just break

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.880 
like this Big Dipper and you just break
along<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.810> soil<00:03:07.520> or<00:03:08.520> what<00:03:09.180> I<00:03:09.210> do<00:03:09.360> is<00:03:10.200> I<00:03:10.650> just

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
along the soil or what I do is I just

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.380 
along the soil or what I do is I just
use<00:03:11.190> my<00:03:11.460> hands<00:03:12.470> and<00:03:13.470> I<00:03:13.650> gently<00:03:14.250> move<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.150> stone

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
use my hands and I gently move the stone

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.360 
use my hands and I gently move the stone
along<00:03:16.160> about<00:03:17.160> a<00:03:17.340> half<00:03:17.670> an<00:03:17.850> inch<00:03:17.940> deep<00:03:19.040> is<00:03:20.040> what

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
along about a half an inch deep is what

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.360 
along about a half an inch deep is what
you<00:03:20.520> need<00:03:20.700> to<00:03:21.120> actually<00:03:21.540> save<00:03:21.810> seeds<00:03:22.230> and<00:03:22.560> then

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
you need to actually save seeds and then

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.370 
you need to actually save seeds and then
when<00:03:23.490> you're<00:03:23.640> sewing<00:03:23.910> them<00:03:24.270> you<00:03:24.510> need<00:03:24.720> to<00:03:25.050> sew

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
when you're sewing them you need to sew

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.990 
when you're sewing them you need to sew
them<00:03:25.940> very<00:03:27.650> sparingly<00:03:28.650> because<00:03:29.340> what<00:03:29.820> you've

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
them very sparingly because what you've

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.600 
them very sparingly because what you've
got<00:03:30.180> to<00:03:30.360> do<00:03:30.540> is<00:03:31.350> you<00:03:31.470> have<00:03:31.680> to<00:03:31.710> actually<00:03:32.310> fill

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
got to do is you have to actually fill

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.670 
got to do is you have to actually fill
them<00:03:32.850> out<00:03:32.970> and<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.750> less<00:03:33.960> spinning<00:03:34.410> out<00:03:34.530> you

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
them out and the less spinning out you

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.760 
them out and the less spinning out you
do<00:03:34.860> the<00:03:35.010> better<00:03:35.190> because<00:03:35.580> you<00:03:36.270> get<00:03:36.710> it's<00:03:37.710> a

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
do the better because you get it's a

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.360 
do the better because you get it's a
little<00:03:38.130> nasty<00:03:38.990> paralyzing<00:03:39.990> lay<00:03:40.980> their<00:03:41.190> eggs

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
little nasty paralyzing lay their eggs

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:49.450 
little nasty paralyzing lay their eggs
and<00:03:41.790> when<00:03:42.750> they<00:03:42.900> smell

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:49.460 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.240 

but<00:03:51.080> generally<00:03:52.080> carrots<00:03:52.500> are<00:03:52.620> pretty<00:03:52.830> easy<00:03:52.980> to

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
but generally carrots are pretty easy to

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.390 
but generally carrots are pretty easy to
burn<00:03:53.430> say<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:54.570> right<00:03:54.750> soil<00:03:54.990> so<00:03:55.710> I<00:03:56.010> will<00:03:56.250> just

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
burn say the right soil so I will just

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.580 
burn say the right soil so I will just
come<00:03:56.610> again<00:03:57.030> a<00:03:57.060> little<00:03:57.450> bit<00:03:57.540> closer<00:03:57.840> I<00:03:58.260> won't

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
come again a little bit closer I won't

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.010 
come again a little bit closer I won't
show<00:04:00.290> okay<00:04:01.290> so<00:04:01.320> we<00:04:01.950> have<00:04:02.190> got<00:04:02.330> and<00:04:03.330> we've<00:04:03.810> made

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
show okay so we have got and we've made

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.510 
show okay so we have got and we've made
our<00:04:04.290> a<00:04:04.530> little<00:04:05.600> drilled<00:04:06.600> here<00:04:07.070> say<00:04:08.070> about<00:04:08.250> half

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
our a little drilled here say about half

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.660 
our a little drilled here say about half
an<00:04:08.670> inch<00:04:08.760> deep<00:04:09.060> and<00:04:09.560> then<00:04:10.560> you<00:04:11.250> need<00:04:11.430> to

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
an inch deep and then you need to

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.630 
an inch deep and then you need to
actually<00:04:12.030> blow<00:04:12.240> carrots<00:04:12.750> in<00:04:12.900> succession

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
actually blow carrots in succession

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.009 
actually blow carrots in succession
because<00:04:14.640> what<00:04:14.850> you<00:04:15.030> don't<00:04:15.270> want<00:04:15.450> is<00:04:15.570> a<00:04:15.600> massive

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
because what you don't want is a massive

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.780 
because what you don't want is a massive
lot<00:04:16.230> of<00:04:16.380> carrots<00:04:16.739> and<00:04:16.830> they're<00:04:16.980> no<00:04:17.130> parent<00:04:17.549> so

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
lot of carrots and they're no parent so

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.910 
lot of carrots and they're no parent so
it's<00:04:18.450> best<00:04:18.630> to<00:04:18.780> grow<00:04:18.959> them<00:04:19.260> every<00:04:19.590> two<00:04:19.859> or

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:19.920 
it's best to grow them every two or

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.210 
it's best to grow them every two or
three<00:04:20.160> weeks<00:04:20.430> maybe<00:04:21.049> weeks<00:04:22.049> depending<00:04:22.320> on<00:04:22.770> how

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
three weeks maybe weeks depending on how

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.190 
three weeks maybe weeks depending on how
much<00:04:23.700> how<00:04:24.090> much<00:04:24.180> products<00:04:24.540> you<00:04:24.690> like<00:04:24.870> to<00:04:25.050> eat

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
much how much products you like to eat

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.790 
much how much products you like to eat
and<00:04:25.590> pretty<00:04:26.580> good<00:04:26.700> for<00:04:26.850> freezing<00:04:27.530> but<00:04:28.530> you

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
and pretty good for freezing but you

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:36.340 
and pretty good for freezing but you
know<00:04:28.920> people<00:04:29.220> to<00:04:29.670> get<00:04:30.770> number

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.280 

okay<00:04:37.100> so<00:04:37.160> what<00:04:37.880> we've<00:04:38.030> got<00:04:38.060> here<00:04:38.210> is<00:04:38.720> early

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
okay so what we've got here is early

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.680 
okay so what we've got here is early
mounts<00:04:39.860> or<00:04:40.040> Mounties<00:04:40.610> some<00:04:40.940> people<00:04:41.270> call<00:04:41.480> them

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
mounts or Mounties some people call them

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.440 
mounts or Mounties some people call them
and<00:04:42.020> they<00:04:43.010> called<00:04:43.310> early<00:04:43.730> but<00:04:43.970> it<00:04:44.120> doesn't

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:44.450 
and they called early but it doesn't

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.420 
and they called early but it doesn't
really<00:04:44.570> matter<00:04:44.870> you<00:04:45.080> can<00:04:45.560> grow<00:04:45.800> them<00:04:46.070> you<00:04:46.400> know

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
really matter you can grow them you know

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.060 
really matter you can grow them you know
pretty<00:04:46.820> much<00:04:47.200> right<00:04:48.200> through<00:04:48.470> spring<00:04:48.830> and

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
pretty much right through spring and

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.550 
pretty much right through spring and
summer<00:04:50.050> right<00:04:51.050> they're<00:04:51.740> tiny<00:04:52.130> little<00:04:52.700> seeds

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
summer right they're tiny little seeds

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.620 
summer right they're tiny little seeds
as<00:04:54.560> you<00:04:54.770> can<00:04:54.980> see<00:04:55.190> they<00:04:55.550> are<00:04:55.580> very<00:04:55.730> very<00:04:56.330> small

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
as you can see they are very very small

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.430 
as you can see they are very very small
and<00:04:57.760> if<00:04:58.760> you<00:04:59.030> just<00:04:59.330> tip<00:04:59.780> them<00:04:59.960> in<00:05:00.170> you're<00:05:00.410> just

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
and if you just tip them in you're just

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.070 
and if you just tip them in you're just
going<00:05:00.770> to<00:05:00.860> get<00:05:01.010> a<00:05:01.040> big<00:05:01.310> pile<00:05:01.610> of<00:05:01.820> carbs<00:05:02.510> in<00:05:02.840> one

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
going to get a big pile of carbs in one

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.590 
going to get a big pile of carbs in one
area<00:05:03.350> so<00:05:04.100> what<00:05:04.250> we<00:05:04.370> need<00:05:04.520> to<00:05:04.700> do<00:05:04.880> is<00:05:05.150> we<00:05:05.360> need<00:05:05.540> to

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
area so what we need to do is we need to

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.380 
area so what we need to do is we need to
sprinkle<00:05:06.380> them<00:05:06.470> in<00:05:06.650> now<00:05:07.220> you<00:05:07.280> could<00:05:07.670> use<00:05:07.970> the

and then sprinkle them in to the soil so

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.020 
and then sprinkle them in to the soil so
you<00:05:25.790> know<00:05:26.660> you<00:05:27.320> can<00:05:27.500> actually<00:05:27.620> see<00:05:28.040> control

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
you know you can actually see control

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.420 
you know you can actually see control
parameter<00:05:29.750> after<00:05:30.020> putting<00:05:30.290> in<00:05:30.500> and<00:05:30.710> you

really<00:05:31.850> do<00:05:32.030> need<00:05:32.210> to<00:05:32.270> put<00:05:32.540> them<00:05:32.750> in<00:05:33.310> very<00:05:34.310> very

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:34.670 
really do need to put them in very very

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:38.410 
really do need to put them in very very

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:38.420 
sparingly now not all of them will

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.600 
sparingly now not all of them will
germinating<00:05:39.170> when<00:05:39.290> they<00:05:39.350> don't<00:05:39.590> don't<00:05:39.920> be<00:05:40.040> no

germinating when they don't don't be no

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:41.020 
germinating when they don't don't be no
just

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.030 
just

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.290 
just
all<00:05:41.240> chewing<00:05:41.630> do<00:05:42.320> me<00:05:42.470> to<00:05:42.620> put<00:05:42.770> a<00:05:42.800> few<00:05:43.040> in<00:05:43.300> to

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
all chewing do me to put a few in to

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.060 
all chewing do me to put a few in to
germinate<00:05:44.750> they're<00:05:45.230> white<00:05:45.410> or<00:05:45.440> germinate

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070 
germinate they're white or germinate

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:47.560 
germinate they're white or germinate
they're<00:05:46.280> pretty<00:05:46.490> good<00:05:46.670> germinating

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:47.570 
they're pretty good germinating

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.170 
they're pretty good germinating
so<00:05:48.290> you're<00:05:48.620> just<00:05:48.650> sprinkling<00:05:49.370> them<00:05:49.640> in<00:05:49.820> like

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
so you're just sprinkling them in like

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:55.330 
so you're just sprinkling them in like
so<00:05:50.510> and<00:05:53.260> once<00:05:54.260> we've<00:05:54.530> got<00:05:54.710> rolling<00:05:55.160> around

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 
so and once we've got rolling around

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:59.840 
so and once we've got rolling around
there

00:05:59.840 --> 00:05:59.850 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:09.230 

all<00:06:00.850> we're<00:06:01.000> going<00:06:01.150> to<00:06:01.270> do<00:06:01.479> is<00:06:01.780> very<00:06:02.199> carefully

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.240 

you<00:06:09.509> need<00:06:09.660> to<00:06:09.840> make<00:06:09.990> sure<00:06:10.020> that<00:06:10.440> your<00:06:10.590> label

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.250 
you need to make sure that your label

you need to make sure that your label
don't<00:06:11.669> forget<00:06:11.970> the<00:06:12.150> label<00:06:12.539> frozen<00:06:13.490> so<00:06:14.490> you

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:14.550 
don't forget the label frozen so you

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.749 
don't forget the label frozen so you
know<00:06:14.850> what<00:06:15.060> you're<00:06:15.180> actually<00:06:15.330> throwing

00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:16.759 
know what you're actually throwing

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:20.360 
know what you're actually throwing
that's<00:06:17.759> why<00:06:18.030> that<00:06:18.449> minute<00:06:19.410> that's<00:06:19.620> so<00:06:20.250> they

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370 
that's why that minute that's so they

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.790 
that's why that minute that's so they
are<00:06:20.520> like<00:06:20.729> early<00:06:21.090> knobs<00:06:21.360> so<00:06:22.320> there<00:06:22.470> you<00:06:22.590> go

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 
are like early knobs so there you go

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.340 
are like early knobs so there you go
that's<00:06:23.009> the<00:06:23.190> first<00:06:23.550> launch<00:06:23.820> of<00:06:23.910> kerosene<00:06:24.449> they

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:25.350 
that's the first launch of kerosene they

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:27.110 
that's the first launch of kerosene they
need<00:06:25.620> to<00:06:25.770> be<00:06:25.889> about<00:06:26.070> half<00:06:26.370> an<00:06:26.520> inch<00:06:26.610> deep<00:06:26.940> and

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 
need to be about half an inch deep and

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.560 
need to be about half an inch deep and
they<00:06:27.330> need<00:06:27.509> to<00:06:27.660> be<00:06:27.870> I<00:06:28.110> would<00:06:28.229> give<00:06:28.620> them<00:06:28.860> a<00:06:29.039> good

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:29.570 
they need to be I would give them a good

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.529 
they need to be I would give them a good
up<00:06:30.570> I'd<00:06:31.199> say<00:06:31.259> it<00:06:31.710> little<00:06:32.100> no<00:06:32.490> 18<00:06:33.030> inches<00:06:33.360> apart

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:33.539 
up I'd say it little no 18 inches apart

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:37.100 
up I'd say it little no 18 inches apart
