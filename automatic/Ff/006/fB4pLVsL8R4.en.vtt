00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.350
 today is the day to learn how to wash the bike 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.350
 see with marcos kafka 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.220
 saturday a good day to change the oil and 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:21.650
 give that washed right laughed in your home 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.509
 your site only care 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.650
 that way you can do something 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:26.650
 that damages your bike 

00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:34.910
 now this is the most appropriate way 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.680
 to wash your motorcycle on a motu roche they 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.739
 will take special care to 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.260
 leave your bike very clean but if you 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.809
 You really want to venture into the wash. 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.789
 good to know well what you are doing not 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.409
 directs the water to the air filter or 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:50.329
 into the exhaust 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:52.699
 in one of the injected rows we have to 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.260
 be careful not to concentrate the jet 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.989
 an electronic component that can be 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.239
 come to damage the same and already in motorcycles 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.789
 carburetor can wash freely 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.589
 only to remember injected are the ones that are 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:05.960
 equipped with electronic injection of 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.820
 captured are those that 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.310
 use known carburetor 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.440
 another tip the use of hot water helps 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.600
 remove dirt more easily 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.619
 as long as the soap is neutral you can use 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.030
 mercilessly 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.100
 now stay away from the solvents 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.990
 including the kerosene they end up 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.210
 dry the rubbers and remove the 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.670
 lubrication plus a product that is 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.369
 I need to be very careful. It 's the little black. 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.039
 in the tire never goes beyond the 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.090
 tread pattern the reason is obvious the tire 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:35.659
 gets slippery 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.820
 You can end up falling to take off. 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.979
 use a soft bristled brush where the 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.920
 cloth does not reach and when it's drying 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.719
 only clean cloth and compressed air in the 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.969
 parts of difficult access 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:47.750
 it does not matter if death is very dirty 

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:51.460
 the little 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.460
 the formula is always the same 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.720
 learned how to do it now the bike is 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.270
 Clean for a beautiful walk but you do not 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.360
 vote has shown the company is there to 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.360
 tip
