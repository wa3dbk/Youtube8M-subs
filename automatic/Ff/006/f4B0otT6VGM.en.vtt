would<00:00:41.879> align<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.390> it<00:00:42.600> was<00:00:42.719> still<00:00:42.989> wouldn't

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
would align it and it was still wouldn't

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.770 
would align it and it was still wouldn't
turn<00:00:43.770> so<00:00:44.040> this<00:00:44.250> is<00:00:44.430> an<00:00:44.520> acceptable<00:00:45.000> puzzle

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
like I said in the last video I really

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.950 
like I said in the last video I really
liked<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.950> way<00:01:40.979> gear<00:01:41.729> 2<00:01:41.909> puzzles<00:01:42.329> turn<00:01:42.630> it's

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
liked the way gear 2 puzzles turn it's

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.230 
liked the way gear 2 puzzles turn it's
just<00:01:43.170> it's<00:01:43.409> satisfying<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.430> turn<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.759> around<00:01:44.850> I

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
just it's satisfying to turn it around I

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.780 
just it's satisfying to turn it around I
find<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.229> be<00:01:46.259> very<00:01:46.350> cool<00:01:46.799> another<00:01:47.640> thing

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
find that to be very cool another thing

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.130 
find that to be very cool another thing
I<00:01:47.880> didn't<00:01:48.060> mention<00:01:48.210> in<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.450> last<00:01:48.600> video<00:01:48.960> is

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
I didn't mention in the last video is

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.859 
I didn't mention in the last video is
that<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.770> can<00:01:49.950> turn<00:01:50.189> all<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:51.119> gears<00:01:51.420> at<00:01:51.630> the

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
that you can turn all the gears at the

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.870 
that you can turn all the gears at the
same<00:01:52.079> time<00:01:52.409> sort<00:01:53.009> of<00:01:53.070> like<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.399> can<00:01:53.549> do<00:01:53.670> for

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
same time sort of like you can do for

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.850 
same time sort of like you can do for
the<00:01:53.939> gear<00:01:54.119> shift<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:55.140> way<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.320> do<00:01:55.680> that

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
the gear shift and the way you do that

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.520 
the gear shift and the way you do that
is<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.189> can<00:01:56.340> turn<00:01:56.579> this<00:01:57.030> edge<00:01:57.270> here<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.780> it's

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
is you can turn this edge here and it's

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.980 
is you can turn this edge here and it's
opposite<00:01:59.100> edge<00:01:59.280> in<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.969> same<00:02:00.180> direction<00:02:00.390> so

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
opposite edge in the same direction so

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.420 
opposite edge in the same direction so
I'm<00:02:01.079> turning<00:02:01.259> them<00:02:01.469> both<00:02:01.619> clockwise<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.369> you

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
I'm turning them both clockwise and you

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.880 
I'm turning them both clockwise and you
can<00:02:02.549> see<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:03.210> entire<00:02:03.630> puzzle<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:04.320> spinning

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
it it's not worth getting just because

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.869 
it it's not worth getting just because
it<00:02:41.760> was<00:02:41.939> unplayable<00:02:42.569> so<00:02:43.019> I<00:02:43.890> have<00:02:44.400> at<00:02:44.549> least<00:02:44.700> two
