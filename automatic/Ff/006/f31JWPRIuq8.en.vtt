00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.500
 Hello, I'm a global manager 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.500
 for Orly product training. 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 I would like to show you how easy and easy it is 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.200
 is to work with our gel manicure. 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.300
 Home alone, 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.700
 with the Orly SmartGels system. 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.600
 As you know, Orly is a trusted and professional company 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.500
 launches quality products 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.200
 and still delivers innovations, such as the original French manicure. 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.000
 Now let's see how you can handle the SmartGels manicure yourself. 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.800
 Here are some of the main benefits that speak for SmartGels. 

00:00:29.825 --> 00:00:33.140
 First I would say that we made the first gel manicure, for the home 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.150
 use, with professional results. 

00:00:35.175 --> 00:00:37.675
 Secondly, it is a great resistance to peeling off the varnish 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.300
 and really long lasting, for two to three weeks, while still being vibrant. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 Thirdly, it is a LED technology for curing paint, at your home. 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.600
 Fourth, it's a quick and easy paint removal system within a minute. 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.300
 And last but not least, it is 12 carefully selected shades of Orly gel lacquers. 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.600
 Now I'll show you how easy it is. 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.500
 Let's start with the Starter Kit and choose the color of your choice. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.100
 In my case, it's a shade, Haute Red. 

00:01:06.125 --> 00:01:07.525
 Getting started. 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.400
 First, fast 5 basic steps. 

00:01:09.625 --> 00:01:11.625
 1. nail preparation 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.650
 2. Cleaning 

00:01:13.675 --> 00:01:16.675
 3. application 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.300
 4. stabilization 

00:01:19.625 --> 00:01:22.625
 and at the end of shine and protection 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.650
 Step 1. - Preparation 

00:01:24.675 --> 00:01:26.675
 Proper preparation is all! 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.086
 Nail treatment. 

00:01:32.669 --> 00:01:36.002
 To nail the nail, use the white side of the nail file. 

00:01:36.797 --> 00:01:38.430
 Push back the cuticle. 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.486
 Now use the other side of the file. Remove grease 

00:01:44.512 --> 00:01:49.834
 and align the nail imperfections. 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.160
 Step 2. Cleaning 

00:01:51.185 --> 00:01:53.785
 Use Smart Cleanser to remove grease. 

00:01:54.376 --> 00:01:59.776
 Tip: Avoid contact of the moistened nail swab while handling the cleaner. 

00:01:59.941 --> 00:02:03.041
 Now you will remove the residual grease left on the nail. 

00:02:03.848 --> 00:02:06.848
 Cleaning 

00:02:06.932 --> 00:02:08.932
 Step 3. - Application 

00:02:09.803 --> 00:02:13.068
 Apply Primer to the nail tip. (base layer) 

00:02:13.174 --> 00:02:14.875
 Leave to dry freely. 

00:02:15.294 --> 00:02:19.094
 Don't worry, it will dry in seconds. 

00:02:20.384 --> 00:02:22.581
 Tip: Keep your hand light. 

00:02:26.758 --> 00:02:31.758
 Apply Base Coat. (primer) 

00:02:32.104 --> 00:02:41.004
 Proceed gently. Apply only a thin layer over the entire nail area. 

00:02:42.863 --> 00:02:44.863
 Step 4. - Stabilization 

00:02:45.188 --> 00:02:48.188
 Use an LED lamp. Allow to cure for 30s. 

00:02:48.213 --> 00:02:50.513
 Treat the thumb separately. 

00:02:50.761 --> 00:02:54.261
 Apply SmartGel in the color of your choice. 

00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:58.958
 In my case, it's Haute Red. 

00:03:04.825 --> 00:03:06.225
 Stabilize for 30s. 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.250
 For best results, it is advisable to apply 2 coats. 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.719
 Tip: Treat the thumb in a separate step. 

00:03:13.551 --> 00:03:17.051
 Apply a second layer of gel varnish. 

00:03:17.757 --> 00:03:20.026
 Insert the LED lamp into the 30s. 

00:03:21.096 --> 00:03:24.429
 Apply the color coat to your thumb in a separate step. 

00:03:24.785 --> 00:03:26.426
 Again, use the LED lamp for 30s. 

00:03:26.576 --> 00:03:30.776
 Step 7. - Top Coat application. (protective coating) 

00:03:32.093 --> 00:03:35.893
 First paint your fingers, then, in a separate step, your thumb. 

00:03:35.918 --> 00:03:39.318
 And now for the last time we use an LED lamp for 30s. 

00:03:39.573 --> 00:03:42.073
 Last step - shine and protection 

00:03:42.326 --> 00:03:50.226
 Dampen the wipe with a cleaner and polish it well. 

00:03:52.284 --> 00:03:55.884
 Remove completely dry, sticky layers 

00:03:57.603 --> 00:04:00.003
 and apply Cuticle Oil, 

00:04:00.671 --> 00:04:05.671
 to achieve true gloss and nail protection. 

00:04:11.444 --> 00:04:14.017
 It's very easy and fun. 

00:04:15.026 --> 00:04:17.226
 If you need a color change during the week 

00:04:17.251 --> 00:04:21.251
 brush your fingernail with Orly varnish with a different color 

00:04:21.276 --> 00:04:27.776
 and just as easily removed with a nail polish remover. 

00:04:32.911 --> 00:04:34.952
 Your nails are perfect again. 

00:04:35.388 --> 00:04:37.088
 Now we will learn how to remove the gel lacquer. 

00:04:37.113 --> 00:04:39.413
 I'll show you how easy it is. 

00:04:39.438 --> 00:04:41.138
 Step One. 

00:04:41.405 --> 00:04:43.117
 Sharpening 

00:04:43.142 --> 00:04:49.242
 Remove the top coat with the white side of the file. 

00:04:51.292 --> 00:04:56.092
 Also, remember to remove the varnish from the nail edges. 

00:04:58.019 --> 00:05:02.713
 Dampen the paint removal pouch with SmartGel Remover. 

00:05:02.954 --> 00:05:04.854
 Place your finger in your pocket for 10 minutes. 

00:05:05.417 --> 00:05:08.017
 There's an amazing third step. 

00:05:08.042 --> 00:05:12.042
 Remove the pouch after 10 minutes 

00:05:13.967 --> 00:05:18.967
 and gently scrape the paint off. 

00:05:18.992 --> 00:05:23.992
 Tip: Use a soft cream for the remnants of paint. 

00:05:38.026 --> 00:05:40.026
 After removing the paint with PUSHER, 

00:05:41.843 --> 00:05:43.408
 roughen the nail with a file 

00:05:43.433 --> 00:05:46.033
 using his dark side and grinding 

00:05:46.058 --> 00:05:48.058
 level the nail surface. 

00:05:48.086 --> 00:05:51.586
 If you still have some nail polish pieces left, don't worry, remove them. 

00:05:53.581 --> 00:05:56.781
 Now your nails are ready for a new color. 

00:05:56.806 --> 00:05:59.806
 Increase your knowledge with my tutorial.
