recording their voice while they're
acting<00:02:17.799> out<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:17.980> scene<00:02:18.190> I<00:02:18.459> think<00:02:18.880> is<00:02:18.970> really

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
acting out the scene I think is really

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.089 
acting out the scene I think is really
important<00:02:19.630> because<00:02:19.690> you<00:02:20.230> you<00:02:20.620> capture<00:02:21.069> that

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
important because you you capture that

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:22.800 
important because you you capture that
moment<00:02:21.430> rather<00:02:21.819> than<00:02:22.000> having<00:02:22.269> them<00:02:22.540> try<00:02:22.780> to

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
moment rather than having them try to

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.370 
moment rather than having them try to
pantomime<00:02:23.530> to<00:02:24.069> some<00:02:24.760> voice<00:02:25.390> dialogue<00:02:26.110> they've

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
pantomime to some voice dialogue they've

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.199 
pantomime to some voice dialogue they've
already<00:02:26.620> recorded<00:02:29.069> the<00:02:30.069> physicality<00:02:30.670> that's

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
already recorded the physicality that's

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.720 
already recorded the physicality that's
demanded<00:02:31.750> to<00:02:32.019> emotion<00:02:32.680> capture<00:02:32.860> and<00:02:33.250> creating

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
demanded to emotion capture and creating

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.150 
demanded to emotion capture and creating

something primitive they thought this

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.400 
something primitive they thought this
would<00:04:56.430> be<00:04:56.460> fun<00:04:56.850> to<00:04:56.910> use<00:04:57.300> unusual<00:04:57.900> instruments

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410

that we do here but not to use them in a
normal<00:05:02.729> way<00:05:03.090> and<00:05:03.560> that<00:05:04.560> sounded<00:05:04.860> really

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
normal way and that sounded really

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.710 
normal way and that sounded really
intriguing<00:05:05.520> to<00:05:05.789> me<00:05:05.820> I<00:05:05.940> like<00:05:06.270> that<00:05:06.450> kind<00:05:06.600> of

phenomenal I think there's a huge value
in<00:06:33.990> going<00:06:34.200> outside<00:06:34.560> your<00:06:34.740> comfort<00:06:34.950> zone<00:06:35.160> as

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:35.610

the<00:06:36.480> game<00:06:36.600> developer<00:06:37.170> you<00:06:37.950> just<00:06:38.130> don't<00:06:38.370> go

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520 
the game developer you just don't go

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.220 
the game developer you just don't go
right<00:06:38.790> to<00:06:39.090> the<00:06:39.240> obvious<00:06:39.420> and<00:06:39.960> that<00:06:40.050> makes

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:40.230 
right to the obvious and that makes

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:42.590 
right to the obvious and that makes
everything<00:06:40.470> much<00:06:40.710> harder<00:06:41.190> but<00:06:42.180> in<00:06:42.300> the<00:06:42.420> end

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:42.600 
everything much harder but in the end

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.260 
everything much harder but in the end
it's<00:06:43.080> all<00:06:43.260> worth<00:06:43.290> it<00:06:43.820> get<00:06:44.820> something<00:06:45.150> that

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:45.270 
it's all worth it get something that

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:48.830 
it's all worth it get something that
people<00:06:45.540> haven't<00:06:45.690> seen

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:48.840
