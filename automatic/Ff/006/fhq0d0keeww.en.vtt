me by hands in a vision and we

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.139 
me by hands in a vision and we
absolutely<00:00:58.379> love<00:00:58.859> this<00:00:59.010> part<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.489> process

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
absolutely love this part of the process

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.510 
absolutely love this part of the process
in<00:01:00.390> this<00:01:00.719> process<00:01:01.260> but<00:01:01.770> what<00:01:01.980> was<00:01:02.129> first<00:01:02.340> an

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
in this process but what was first an

in this process but what was first an
idea<00:01:02.910> becomes<00:01:03.629> reality<00:01:03.870> translates<00:01:04.860> into<00:01:05.100> a

idea becomes reality translates into a
three-dimensional<00:01:05.939> shape<00:01:07.549> these<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.939> ensure

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
three-dimensional shape these to ensure

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.520
