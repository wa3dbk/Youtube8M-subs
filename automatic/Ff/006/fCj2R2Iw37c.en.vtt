00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
countertop and the upper cabinets is

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.140 
countertop and the upper cabinets is
about<00:02:10.709> up<00:02:11.709> to<00:02:11.920> 19<00:02:12.459> inches<00:02:12.700> most<00:02:13.390> of<00:02:13.569> the<00:02:13.660> time

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
about up to 19 inches most of the time

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.759 
about up to 19 inches most of the time
and<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:17.560> area<00:02:17.950> that<00:02:18.160> actually<00:02:18.250> gets<00:02:18.700> covered

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
and the area that actually gets covered

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.059 
and the area that actually gets covered
with<00:02:20.769> the<00:02:20.860> backsplash<00:02:22.200> it's<00:02:23.200> only<00:02:23.440> about<00:02:23.680> 15

with the backsplash it's only about 15

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:30.000 
with the backsplash it's only about 15
inches<00:02:24.790> so<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:25.930> answer<00:02:26.290> is<00:02:26.470> yes<00:02:27.060> it<00:02:28.290> will<00:02:29.290> most

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
inches so the answer is yes it will most

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.339 
inches so the answer is yes it will most
likely<00:02:30.190> work<00:02:30.700> for<00:02:30.970> you<00:02:31.120> but<00:02:31.780> you<00:02:31.930> can<00:02:32.170> always

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
measure it then make sure what else is
