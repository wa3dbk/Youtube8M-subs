00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:08.730
 Hello, I 'm out of here, what am I using? 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.780
 galaxy tab 4 and today I'm going to talk about this game 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.660
 very cool 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.820
 cartoon ran is one in a mix of 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.400
 mario kart with all the characters in the 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.400
 cartoon network of old and new 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.369
 that will show you how it works in 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.289
 tournament and an adventure tutor lei you 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.830
 choose the universe you want to enter 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.830
 In the new adventure I love there are several 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.079
 paths that you are advancing with the 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.730
 phases and releases according to the 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:42.329
 number of stars you can get 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:43.290
 show now you can customize the 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.309
 your car 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.399
 To Choose a Casing Wheel and Exhaust 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.170
 but you need the money for this 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:54.989
 down here you can see energy that 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.140
 you need to be able to power 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.390
 You can also improve your car and 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.820
 make it more powerful with speed 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.119
 tube acceleration which is the item that 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.070
 people get the same item as the mario 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.820
 Does your character talk to you? 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.200
 flapjack is a bit annoying but with this gems 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.740
 What do you get in races too? 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.320
 You can release other characters I 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.439
 I released the end of the adventure time then 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.560
 I'll choose it there are several 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.390
 routes that you are releasing from 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:35.520
 According to your progress I will 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:39.740
 show a stage here to see how 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.740
 the instructions work 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:52.500
 the style is equal mario kart even only 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.689
 came from eight are six sectional to 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.469
 You just have to put your finger on the 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.460
 screen and move proagro you want 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.729
 walk 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:06.039
 Now I got a book to increase the 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:10.390
 amount of coins I get 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:15.160
 look at a gem here but I did not get two 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:18.730
 second place i'm think rex 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.860
 to stay here face the good 10 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.870
 I 'm at first I'm going to try 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.450
 take a gem 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.000
 this box of tomatoes that I just played 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.720
 it is to disrupt the vision and who 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.720
 like her 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:43.130
 now each phase has the number of laps and 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:46.130
 a difficulty has to keep an eye on 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:49.820
 here the side of the paper to which it number 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:52.070
 Sometimes you think you had three 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:56.260
 laps of the race but she had 4 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.260
 you wind up losing that you slow down 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:05.290
 and I think I'll be able to get in 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:05.290
 first place in this one got today 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.439
 there is the amount of money and 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:20.370
 gems and I got the money that's 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:22.560
 edit my car and an improvement and 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.230
 gem used to buy others 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:37.950
 characters 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:40.349
 let's now pass in tournament mode or 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.299
 As I said, you choose the universe. 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:44.930

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.930

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:52.469

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:54.120
 home uncle or make the world the gamble o 

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:56.579
 from ben 10 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.949
 just the hour show of adventure and the 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:01.829
 tournament manager who has the characters 

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:02.819

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:05.370
 powerful 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:06.540
 I will choose the adventure diary that 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.169
 I really like 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:13.379
 do not run again but have a gem 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:20.090
 I'll make a change in my car and 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:20.090
 took with yes and let's start 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.050
 I think it's really cool, this game catches everyone. 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:36.120
 the characters of various drawings and 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.580
 places in the same place 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.199
 This phase here is different and I see 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.259
 twitter she has things that hinder 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:49.639
 I ended up knocking on a chime box. 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:53.460
 I messed up now and tried to go here. 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:55.469
 all this race here five people who 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.719
 it's three laps 

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:59.289
 only that jack hit that deal is ok 

00:04:57.719 --> 00:05:05.009
 beating 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:08.710
 we are here in the kingdom of the cold king no 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:10.389
 clothing almost as flawless lipstick as 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:18.939
 It's very close so do not hit the 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:21.639
 boxes as there is no way they got 

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:23.649
 so I do not run the risk of being attacked 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:27.520
 just do not mess up I came 

00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:29.580
 first I ended up beating again and 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.580
 new 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:55.510
 the close that the day that will be born lasts and 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:06:07.510
 we got to win from animal gems 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:08.560
 a large baseline and appears in the 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.930
 placing 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:14.740
 I can play in the other worlds but not 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:17.080

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.720

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.250
 mario kart with the cartoon characters 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:24.430

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:29.770
