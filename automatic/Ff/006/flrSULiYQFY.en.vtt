00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
spots with Ella but on the start line it

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.369 
spots with Ella but on the start line it
was<00:00:56.579> obvious<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.239> Estonian<00:00:57.899> hold<00:00:58.140> was

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
was obvious that the Estonian hold was

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.619 
was obvious that the Estonian hold was
going<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.620> be<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.770> fastest<00:00:59.340> but<00:00:59.850> but<00:01:00.059> also<00:01:00.180> the

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
going to be the fastest but but also the

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.470 
going to be the fastest but but also the
most<00:01:00.809> precarious<00:01:01.640> can<00:01:02.640> we<00:01:02.760> go<00:01:02.940> with<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.239> rates

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
most precarious can we go with the rates

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.149 
most precarious can we go with the rates
additional<00:01:03.989> what<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.170> call<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.439> piggyback<00:01:04.830> man

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
additional what I call a piggyback man

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.380 
additional what I call a piggyback man
it<00:01:05.280> might<00:01:05.460> not<00:01:05.580> be<00:01:05.670> as<00:01:05.729> quick<00:01:05.970> but<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.210> think

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
it might not be as quick but I think

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.660 
it might not be as quick but I think
it's<00:01:06.479> safer<00:01:06.900> yeah<00:01:07.320> over<00:01:07.680> those<00:01:07.770> hay<00:01:08.220> bales<00:01:08.250> and

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
it's safer yeah over those hay bales and

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.219 
it's safer yeah over those hay bales and
everything<00:01:08.970> show<00:01:09.270> them<00:01:09.479> how<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:09.659> said<00:01:10.080> yeah
