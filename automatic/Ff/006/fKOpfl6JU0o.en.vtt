with<00:00:49.110> me<00:00:49.379> but<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:49.950> gave<00:00:50.160> me<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.610> idea<00:00:50.760> to

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
with me but that gave me the idea to

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.720 
with me but that gave me the idea to
start<00:00:51.620> selling<00:00:52.620> water<00:00:53.660> so<00:00:54.660> what<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:54.899> did<00:00:55.050> was<00:00:55.730> I

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
start selling water so what I did was I

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.160 
start selling water so what I did was I
tried<00:00:57.090> selling<00:00:57.719> one<00:00:58.350> pack<00:00:58.710> each<00:00:59.629> each<00:01:00.629> week

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
tried selling one pack each each week

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.810 
tried selling one pack each each week
and<00:01:02.719> that<00:01:03.719> was<00:01:03.960> successful<00:01:04.640> and<00:01:05.640> then<00:01:05.790> I

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
and that was successful and then I

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.649 
and that was successful and then I
actually<00:01:06.000> ran<00:01:06.570> out<00:01:07.369> so<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:08.400> decided<00:01:08.939> maybe<00:01:09.420> I

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
actually ran out so I decided maybe I

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:26.340 
actually ran out so I decided maybe I
should<00:01:09.930> buy<00:01:10.110> one<00:01:10.409> pack<00:01:10.680> each<00:01:11.159> day
