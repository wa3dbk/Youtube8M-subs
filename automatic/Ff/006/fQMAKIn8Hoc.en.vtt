sure what that means i think it just

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.300 
sure what that means i think it just
means<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.200> maybe<00:01:55.500> im<00:01:55.680> bored<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:55.979> this<00:01:56.070> series

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
means that maybe im bored of this series

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.130 
means that maybe im bored of this series
in<00:01:56.579> general<00:01:56.729> or<00:01:57.180> this<00:01:57.329> game<00:01:57.570> which<00:01:57.869> just

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
in general or this game which just

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.859 
in general or this game which just
wasn't<00:01:58.530> good<00:01:58.740> enough<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:59.130> keep<00:01:59.250> my<00:01:59.460> attention

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.020 
wasn't good enough to keep my attention
either<00:02:00.869> way<00:02:01.250> i'm<00:02:02.250> starting<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.759> think<00:02:02.850> that

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
either way i'm starting to think that

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.740 
either way i'm starting to think that
myself<00:02:03.509> i<00:02:04.140> have<00:02:04.890> like<00:02:05.430> thirty<00:02:05.880> three<00:02:06.180> days<00:02:06.390> or

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
and I want to try and see if I can get

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.290 
and I want to try and see if I can get
more<00:02:10.709> days<00:02:11.009> in<00:02:11.250> modern<00:02:11.489> warfare<00:02:11.610> 3<00:02:11.819> than<00:02:12.180> I<00:02:12.239> do

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
more days in modern warfare 3 than I do

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.250 
more days in modern warfare 3 than I do
black<00:02:12.810> ops

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
black ops

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.809 
black ops
um<00:02:14.390> my<00:02:15.390> total<00:02:15.659> in<00:02:15.720> black<00:02:15.900> ops<00:02:16.110> was<00:02:16.409> 35<00:02:17.010> so<00:02:17.790> I

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
um my total in black ops was 35 so I

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.460 
um my total in black ops was 35 so I
want<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.150> see<00:02:18.239> if<00:02:18.329> I<00:02:18.390> can<00:02:18.540> beat<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:18.780> mar<00:02:19.110> 4<00:02:19.290> 3

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.630 
want to see if I can beat that mar 4 3
that<00:02:19.590> means<00:02:19.620> i<00:02:19.829> need<00:02:19.860> to<00:02:20.010> put<00:02:20.099> on<00:02:20.220> another<00:02:20.400> two

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
that means i need to put on another two

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.670 
that means i need to put on another two
days<00:02:20.849> played<00:02:21.209> which<00:02:21.930> i<00:02:22.200> don't<00:02:22.290> know<00:02:22.500> if<00:02:22.590> i'm

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
days played which i don't know if i'm

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.990 
days played which i don't know if i'm
going<00:02:22.799> to<00:02:22.860> reach<00:02:23.069> now<00:02:23.280> something<00:02:23.819> I<00:02:23.879> actually

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
going to reach now something I actually

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.490 
going to reach now something I actually
wanted<00:02:24.329> to<00:02:24.450> do<00:02:24.569> just<00:02:24.840> to<00:02:24.930> say<00:02:25.079> that<00:02:25.230> I<00:02:25.260> played

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
wanted to do just to say that I played

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.069 
wanted to do just to say that I played
it<00:02:25.620> model<00:02:25.860> for<00:02:26.040> three<00:02:26.220> more<00:02:26.340> than<00:02:26.519> black<00:02:26.760> ops

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:27.079 
it model for three more than black ops

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:29.720 
it model for three more than black ops
just<00:02:28.079> like<00:02:28.230> Emma<00:02:28.709> doesn't<00:02:29.250> really<00:02:29.489> mean<00:02:29.700> much

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
just like Emma doesn't really mean much

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.789 
just like Emma doesn't really mean much
I<00:02:30.269> just<00:02:30.450> thought<00:02:30.629> it'd<00:02:30.720> be<00:02:30.780> cool<00:02:30.870> to<00:02:31.140> have<00:02:31.440> more

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
I just thought it'd be cool to have more

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.569 
I just thought it'd be cool to have more
on<00:02:32.069> the<00:02:32.280> following<00:02:33.060> game<00:02:33.950> but<00:02:34.950> i'm<00:02:35.190> not<00:02:35.340> sure

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
on the following game but i'm not sure

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:36.979 
on the following game but i'm not sure
if<00:02:35.730> that's<00:02:35.909> gonna<00:02:36.060> happen<00:02:36.150> though<00:02:36.690> just

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
if that's gonna happen though just

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.330 
if that's gonna happen though just
because<00:02:37.079> i<00:02:37.500> kind<00:02:37.680> of<00:02:37.769> want<00:02:37.950> to<00:02:38.010> play<00:02:38.159> different

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
because i kind of want to play different

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.640 
because i kind of want to play different
games<00:02:38.629> but<00:02:39.629> this<00:02:39.810> doesn't<00:02:40.140> mean<00:02:40.200> that<00:02:40.409> i'm

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
games but this doesn't mean that i'm

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.289 
games but this doesn't mean that i'm
gonna<00:02:40.859> stop<00:02:41.190> uploading<00:02:41.519> them<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.760> be<00:02:41.970> 3<00:02:42.180> i'll

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
gonna stop uploading them to be 3 i'll

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.089 
gonna stop uploading them to be 3 i'll
probably<00:02:42.659> still<00:02:42.989> primarily<00:02:43.260> be<00:02:43.650> uploading

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
probably still primarily be uploading

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.740 
probably still primarily be uploading
model<00:02:44.340> for<00:02:44.519> three<00:02:44.700> just<00:02:44.970> not<00:02:45.090> playing<00:02:45.390> it<00:02:45.569> as

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
model for three just not playing it as

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.020 
model for three just not playing it as
much<00:02:46.079> so<00:02:46.620> that's<00:02:47.010> all<00:02:47.159> that<00:02:47.190> really<00:02:47.370> means<00:02:47.849> but

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
much so that's all that really means but

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.780

what games don't want to go back to I
was<00:02:58.799> kind<00:02:58.889> of<00:02:59.040> thinking<00:02:59.129> that<00:02:59.459> I<00:02:59.909> was<00:03:00.150> thinking

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.660 
was kind of thinking that I was thinking
maybe<00:03:00.569> modern<00:03:00.989> warfare<00:03:01.170> 2<00:03:01.470> model<00:03:02.010> 42<00:03:02.190> I<00:03:02.370> don't

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.930 
maybe modern warfare 2 model 42 I don't
know<00:03:02.790> it's<00:03:03.510> kind<00:03:03.569> of<00:03:03.720> hacked<00:03:04.430> same<00:03:05.430> thing<00:03:05.700> with
