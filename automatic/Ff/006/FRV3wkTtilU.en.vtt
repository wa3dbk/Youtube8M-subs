called a spider hitch which is used to
make<00:00:07.609> a<00:00:07.880> loop<00:00:08.510> at<00:00:08.809> the<00:00:08.840> end<00:00:08.929> of<00:00:09.170> your<00:00:09.290> mainline

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:16.720 
put a loop at the end of your mainline
well<00:00:13.849> the<00:00:14.269> number<00:00:14.539> one<00:00:14.690> reason<00:00:15.110> is<00:00:15.520> it's<00:00:16.520> nice

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:16.730 
well the number one reason is it's nice

to<00:00:16.940> have<00:00:17.090> a<00:00:17.119> double<00:00:17.630> strand<00:00:18.380> of<00:00:18.740> line<00:00:19.220> that<00:00:20.210> you

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
to have a double strand of line that you

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.540 
to have a double strand of line that you
grab<00:00:20.660> onto<00:00:20.990> when<00:00:21.260> you're<00:00:21.590> pulling<00:00:22.070> orally

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
during a fish to the boat it just gives

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.060 
during a fish to the boat it just gives
you<00:00:25.460> a<00:00:25.520> little<00:00:25.730> bit<00:00:25.970> more<00:00:26.270> strength<00:00:26.860> plus<00:00:27.860> it

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
you a little bit more strength plus it

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.070 
you a little bit more strength plus it
makes<00:00:28.220> it<00:00:28.430> easy<00:00:28.640> there<00:00:29.480> are<00:00:29.510> several<00:00:29.780> easy

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080

you<00:00:47.420> just<00:00:47.659> make<00:00:47.839> a<00:00:47.870> loop<00:00:48.309> pinch<00:00:49.309> it<00:00:49.460> between

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
you just make a loop pinch it between

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.329 
you just make a loop pinch it between
your<00:00:49.879> thumb<00:00:50.120> and<00:00:50.149> your<00:00:50.300> forefinger<00:00:50.960> and<00:00:51.339> then

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
pass it back through the loop you just

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.830 
pass it back through the loop you just
made<00:01:02.749> and<00:01:03.229> then<00:01:03.800> carefully<00:01:04.250> pull<00:01:04.729> so<00:01:05.570> that<00:01:05.720> the

made and then carefully pull so that the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.789 
made and then carefully pull so that the
lines<00:01:06.079> reel<00:01:07.040> off<00:01:07.310> your<00:01:07.549> thumb<00:01:08.200> around<00:01:09.200> the

back of the line there and makes the

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.749 
back of the line there and makes the
knot<00:01:11.719> once<00:01:12.350> you<00:01:12.500> get<00:01:12.649> it<00:01:12.740> all<00:01:12.829> off<00:01:13.130> your<00:01:13.460> voice'

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:22.490 
knit get a wrap on it with your hands
and<00:01:17.659> then<00:01:17.750> just<00:01:18.560> pull<00:01:18.770> it<00:01:18.860> down

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.120 

it<00:01:23.280> makes<00:01:23.580> them<00:01:23.760> long<00:01:23.940> makes<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.630> nice<00:01:25.350> loop<00:01:25.890> now

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
it makes them long makes a nice loop now

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.600 
it makes them long makes a nice loop now
this<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.550> probably<00:01:26.910> 80<00:01:27.660> to<00:01:27.840> 90<00:01:28.320> percent

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
this is probably 80 to 90 percent

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.460 
this is probably 80 to 90 percent
strength<00:01:29.610> not<00:01:29.940> which<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:30.870> not<00:01:31.020> as<00:01:31.140> good<00:01:31.350> as<00:01:31.440> a

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
strength not which is not as good as a

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.080 
strength not which is not as good as a
bimini<00:01:31.800> twist<00:01:32.160> but<00:01:32.370> I've<00:01:32.490> never<00:01:32.700> been<00:01:32.880> very

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
bimini twist but I've never been very

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.219 
bimini twist but I've never been very
good<00:01:33.150> at<00:01:33.479> it<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.910> tiny<00:01:35.910> bit<00:01:36.150> MIDI<00:01:36.330> twist<00:01:36.660> so<00:01:36.960> you

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
good at it a tiny bit MIDI twist so you

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.530 
good at it a tiny bit MIDI twist so you
know<00:01:37.470> if<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.710> can<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.250> would<00:01:38.610> use<00:01:38.940> that<00:01:39.180> instead

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
know if you can I would use that instead

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.990 
know if you can I would use that instead
of<00:01:39.600> this<00:01:39.810> knot<00:01:40.050> but<00:01:40.320> this<00:01:40.440> is<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.619> quick<00:01:40.950> and
