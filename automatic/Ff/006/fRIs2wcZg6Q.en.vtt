didn't shoot threes when you're an
elementary<00:00:37.950> whatever<00:00:38.250> so<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:39.030> know<00:00:39.120> once<00:00:39.329> i

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
elementary whatever so you know once i

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.440 
elementary whatever so you know once i
got<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.290> older<00:00:40.710> ages<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.250> sizes<00:00:41.730> falling<00:00:42.270> down

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
got to older ages and sizes falling down

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.600 
got to older ages and sizes falling down
so<00:00:42.780> i<00:00:43.020> guess<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.739> was<00:00:43.829> my<00:00:43.860> game<00:00:44.129> there<00:00:44.370> and

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
so i guess that was my game there and

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.779 
so i guess that was my game there and
shooting<00:00:45.120> at<00:00:45.239> all<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:46.079> lost<00:00:46.829> art<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.460> mean<00:00:47.670> it

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
shooting at all a lost art I mean it

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:48.950 
shooting at all a lost art I mean it
seems<00:00:47.940> like<00:00:48.059> more<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.420> more<00:00:48.660> than

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
seems like more and more than

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.799 
seems like more and more than
athleticism<00:00:49.559> just<00:00:50.190> what<00:00:50.430> surprised<00:00:50.879> uh<00:00:51.420> yeah

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
athleticism just what surprised uh yeah

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.900 
athleticism just what surprised uh yeah
I'd<00:00:51.960> say<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.739> lost<00:00:52.980> art<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.309> bass<00:00:53.489> right<00:00:53.699> now
