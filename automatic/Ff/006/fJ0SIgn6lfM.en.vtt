 published in which the brad pitt after 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:49.010
 Moscow traveled and that would have 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.540
 really epic battles given 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.189
 parts of it have even been filmed 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.930
 until it was canceled because otherwise 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:54.950
 maybe the budget would have been blown up 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.989
