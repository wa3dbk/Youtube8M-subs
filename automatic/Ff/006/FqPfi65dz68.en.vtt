00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.490
 O 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.840
 Hello dear musicians and musicians 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.470
 Welcome to the classic 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:35.320
 chant my instruments inspirations 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.200
 just between us said that course 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.180
 with euro 4 are added while for 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.640
 me enough of an older one 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.010
 keyboard on at least this yamaha 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.660
 top model to change 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.309
 have presentations on my keyboard 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.980
 I have often experienced that 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:53.160
 listeners react strongly to the choirs 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.450
 no wonder 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.850
 Of course you can only have one 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:12.720
 single curve select it and 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:16.460
 play but in the mix they sound 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.460
 just more impressive 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.060
 as you know, I have the choirs too 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.640
 so they programmed something 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.460
 they do not sound like that 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.480
 they do not need any choppy stuff 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.430
 system pedals 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.290
 like the life ball pianos I have 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.510
 also these registrations in pairs 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.520
 programmed so that always the same 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:49.090
 chor sound still an increase possible 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.970
 This has mostly to do with playing because 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.040
 it is rare at olivaer 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.930
 yamaha has programmed the curve like that 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.420
 that it starts with the men downstairs 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.070
 and then stepless to women and children 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.660
 passes 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.600
 so it is only from their played 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.860
 octave depending on whether women men 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.450
 or children sing 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.450
 I have no influence on that 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.989
 I recommend them with the 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.290
 left hand no handles in the distance of 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.849
 to grab less than a quad 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.450
 often sounded best when you got the 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:36.620
 grundton the quint or whether sheep plays 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.370
 with the right hand you can 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.630
 without hesitation playing polyphonic chords 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.250
 it always sounds special 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.610
 interesting if you are in more location 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.890
 just play the middle tone 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.980
 an originally three-part battery 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.030
 put on the right hand 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.840
 otherwise I'll just leave the 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.840
 choirs speak 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.120
 Have fun while listening 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.090
 hmm 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:21.639
 O 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.790
 O 

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.430
 O 

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:30.230
 now have fun playing it yourself and 

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:30.230
 bye bye
