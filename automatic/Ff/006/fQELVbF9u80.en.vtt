00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.170 
disagree with this I do think that there
are<00:04:31.530> many<00:04:31.680> areas<00:04:31.860> in<00:04:32.160> which<00:04:32.370> both<00:04:32.639> games<00:04:32.940> are

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
are many areas in which both games are

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.919 
are many areas in which both games are
on<00:04:33.270> failure<00:04:33.600> and<00:04:33.930> superior<00:04:34.380> to<00:04:34.500> one<00:04:34.620> another
