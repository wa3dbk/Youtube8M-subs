00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
hip in my elbow the hip and elbow

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.609 
hip in my elbow the hip and elbow
position<00:00:15.389> is<00:00:15.870> crucial

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
position is crucial

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.300 
position is crucial
okay<00:00:17.609> first<00:00:18.000> with<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.420> hip<00:00:18.600> um<00:00:19.039> you<00:00:20.039> need<00:00:20.160> the

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
okay first with the hip um you need the

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.160 
okay first with the hip um you need the
hip<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.850> be<00:00:20.970> under<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.420> uppercut<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.020> to

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
hip to be under the uppercut and to

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:22.820 
hip to be under the uppercut and to
support<00:00:22.590> it

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
support it

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.769 
support it
so<00:00:23.189> your<00:00:23.369> hip<00:00:23.519> is<00:00:23.670> out<00:00:23.760> here<00:00:24.119> it's<00:00:24.330> not<00:00:24.539> under

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779

so your hip is out here it's not under
the<00:00:24.900> uppercut<00:00:25.260> this<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.650> not<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.800> very<00:00:25.980> powerful

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
the uppercut this is not a very powerful

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.849 
the uppercut this is not a very powerful
overcome<00:00:26.789> okay<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:27.750> need<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.140> here<00:00:28.410> you<00:00:28.710> need

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
overcome okay you need it here you need

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.859 
overcome okay you need it here you need
to<00:00:28.949> get<00:00:29.099> this<00:00:29.279> hip<00:00:29.519> as<00:00:29.730> close<00:00:30.300> as<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:30.599> can

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
to get this hip as close as you can

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:31.580 
to get this hip as close as you can
under<00:00:31.289> it

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
under it

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.190 
under it
okay<00:00:32.309> so<00:00:32.759> instead<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:33.059> here<00:00:33.300> maybe<00:00:33.630> here<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:34.079> it

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
okay so instead of here maybe here is it

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.979 
okay so instead of here maybe here is it
there<00:00:34.380> okay<00:00:35.340> or<00:00:35.579> on<00:00:35.760> this<00:00:35.940> side<00:00:36.149> my<00:00:36.300> right<00:00:36.329> side

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
there okay or on this side my right side

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.799 
there okay or on this side my right side
maybe<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.950> know<00:00:38.040> here<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.460> better<00:00:38.670> if<00:00:39.239> this<00:00:39.570> is

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
maybe you know here is better if this is

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.119 
maybe you know here is better if this is
going<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.079> be<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.200> weak<00:00:40.469> uppercut

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
going to be a weak uppercut

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.410 
going to be a weak uppercut
this<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.640> going<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.820> be<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:41.910> little<00:00:42.180> bit<00:00:42.270> more

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
this is going to be a little bit more

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.959 
this is going to be a little bit more
powerful<00:00:42.870> because<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.110> have<00:00:43.320> my<00:00:43.440> hip<00:00:43.649> under<00:00:43.980> now

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
powerful because I have my hip under now
