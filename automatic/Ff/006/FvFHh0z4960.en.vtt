00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:06.019
 one of the basic ingredients for 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.069
 cook the cartagenera post 

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:22.199
 undoubtedly will be the magic of 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:24.570
 cartagena to prepare the meat 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.480
 I'm going to use a black tip 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.509
 Anca must retain all the fat that is 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.900
 which is going to burn the post and 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:37.500
 when it cooks let go all the 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:40.710
 flavor this meat tends to support a 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.050
 I'm going to introduce some nails 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.350
 smell with a salt for the part 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:50.320
 in the skin these requirements are removed 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.390
 a little to prevent the meat from getting in 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.809
 rose that at the moment it is 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:01:00.159
 sealing I'll put some pepper 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:03.309
 once the pan is hot 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:07.509
 I'm going to put the meat on the side of the 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:10.590
 I'm not going to need oil once 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:14.870
 the oil is hot I'm going to sauté 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.770
 red onion or onion of your choice 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.770
 with here 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.149
 sweet or so creole garlic 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.710
 I'll put some black sauce 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:34.110
 panela 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.110
 some nails pepper pain 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.070
 this broth is made with vegetables 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.680
 that I have left of the waste when 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:46.190
 cut the tomato and peeled it off 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:50.540
 the seeds the onion peel the 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:52.510
 paprika peel and I'll put a little 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.480
 more than panela 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:58.660
 rectify the salt that is the one that achieves 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.800
 balance the acid the sweet and the 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.280
 hot spicy 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:06.160
 you have to wait approximately 10 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.190
 minutes to reduce a little and it 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.590
 homogenize in all flavors once 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.590
 I hope it boils I'll put the meat 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.900
 I'm going to make the meat impregnate and 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.860
 let loose all the flavor in this sauce 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:24.760
 to accompany it I will prepare a risotto of 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:29.170
 hogao barley will put some 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:31.790
 onion oil onion garlic tomatoes 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.459
 I am using paprika 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.310
 I'm really using the same 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:40.370
 ingredients that you use for meat 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:43.920
 clear that the flavor here will be totally 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:48.239
 different to the taste of risotto 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:50.630
 I have taken the tea tito the coconut that is 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.630
 all 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.570
 d 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:00.590
 put or reduce with sugar the first 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.590
 attraction of milk 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.790
 I'm going to add a little salt salt 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.620
 makes the juices come out 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.530
 once 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:15.069
 the ingredients are sautéed and 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:18.790
 roasted I'm going to put the barley that has 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:21.819
 been left from the previous night in 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.750
 water because it 's a bit hard on this 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:28.380
 way I'm putting some wine 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:33.170
 adding a little broth 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.170
 for me the inevitable has taken effect 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:43.579
 I'm going to let you know that once 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:46.099
 dried this part I'm putting broth 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:49.129
 as long as the 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:51.490
 barley goes the same as the rice goes 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:54.370
 opening 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.820
 it is enlarged but likewise this helps 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:01.090
 much stay the night before 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:04.390
 soak I will identify the salt I put it 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:07.450
 at the end to not delay the firing him 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.430
 I will give a touch of green putting a 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.700
 little onion I like a lot 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.980
 use the achiote look how cute 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.220
 skip the colors I'll put a little now 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:21.580
 and I'll put a little later if you do not 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:24.750
 move this constantly tends to 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:29.129
 paste and then it's going to be more complicated 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:32.569
 for the meat I'm going to bathe a little 

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:32.569
 this can be covered 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.910
 so that it does not evaporate so much but if 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.920
 reaches them get dry much you 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:43.720
 they can put a little more lime the 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.720
 truth is that this pod knows good 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:49.259
 when I put the meat on the side of 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.300
 chubby started to drop and this fat that 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:53.909
 you see here is the one that releases the 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.449
 meat the term of the meat are going 

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:56.449
 your 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.390
 I'm going to withdraw so that it's available 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.600
 plus the cut 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:08.320
 the cut is fundamental at the tip of 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:13.150
 anca if I cut the meat through the 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:16.150
 fiber is very likely that the meat at 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.780
 split it is hard then what I'm going to 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:20.750
 do is 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:24.260
 cut the meat 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:26.350
 towards the middle look this juicy for 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.980
 inside 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:34.570
 the cut that I'm going to make is the opposite 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:38.020
 to the fiber if you want a little 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:41.880
 more cooked can be cut and finished 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.880
 to cook in the sauce 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:50.420
 I'll put 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:53.110
 a little of the risotto that is going treating 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.110
 to give it height 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.260
 a little hill up 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:06.040
 additional is a bit of the sauce with the 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.950
 flavors of my land where a twig of 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:11.560
 cilantro to decorate I love the 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:14.860
 colors of the Caribbean and they are also a 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.870
 basic ingredient in my dishes I'm going to 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:20.560
 make another presentation of it 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:23.710
 sweet potato is a sweet tuber 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:28.530
 that are eaten a lot in the sucre savannah 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:28.530
 Córdoba and Bolívar in the Atlantic 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:38.080
 in each dish that I prepare I feel that there 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:38.080
 a sunset the sunset of my city
