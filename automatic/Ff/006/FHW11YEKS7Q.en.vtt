or computerized tomography one of the

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.069 
or computerized tomography one of the
reasons<00:00:44.160> for<00:00:44.219> leaving<00:00:44.640> out<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.300> part<00:00:45.840> is

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
reasons for leaving out the a part is

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.360 
reasons for leaving out the a part is
because<00:00:46.640> the<00:00:47.640> CT<00:00:48.539> scanning<00:00:49.020> has<00:00:49.530> gotten<00:00:50.070> so

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
because the CT scanning has gotten so

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.150 
because the CT scanning has gotten so
advanced<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.210> really<00:00:51.539> we<00:00:52.140> don't<00:00:52.379> just<00:00:52.739> see

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
advanced that really we don't just see

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.930 
advanced that really we don't just see
these<00:00:53.370> in<00:00:53.610> axial<00:00:54.300> cuts<00:00:55.129> anymore<00:00:56.129> but<00:00:56.399> also<00:00:56.610> we

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
these in axial cuts anymore but also we

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.880 
these in axial cuts anymore but also we
can<00:00:57.120> arrange<00:00:57.449> these<00:00:57.750> in<00:00:58.020> multiple<00:00:58.590> other

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
can arrange these in multiple other

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.639 
can arrange these in multiple other
dimensions<00:00:59.730> an<00:00:59.910> axial<00:01:00.510> cut<00:01:00.780> would<00:01:01.020> be<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.230> cut

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
dimensions an axial cut would be a cut

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.800 
dimensions an axial cut would be a cut
like<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.399> through<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.270> body<00:01:03.830> whereas<00:01:04.830> a

are<00:01:19.229> only<00:01:19.490> 2.5<00:01:20.600> millimeters<00:01:21.600> we<00:01:21.960> want<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.259> know

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
are only 2.5 millimeters we want to know

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.499 
are only 2.5 millimeters we want to know
that<00:01:22.530> this<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:22.890> very<00:01:22.920> close<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.939> gives<00:01:24.180> me<00:01:24.360> the

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
that this is very close it gives me the

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.990 
that this is very close it gives me the
opportunity<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.170> evaluate<00:01:25.409> your<00:01:26.040> tumor<00:01:26.400> just

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
opportunity to evaluate your tumor just

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.520 
opportunity to evaluate your tumor just
as<00:01:27.330> closely<00:01:27.689> as<00:01:28.140> if<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.610> had<00:01:29.970> contrast<00:01:30.780> in<00:01:31.140> the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
as closely as if you had contrast in the

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.190 
as closely as if you had contrast in the
system<00:01:32.040> but<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:33.299> don't<00:01:33.540> have<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.869> drink

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
system but you don't have to drink

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.679 
system but you don't have to drink
anything<00:01:34.860> for<00:01:35.070> contrast<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.119> we<00:01:36.150> don't<00:01:36.540> have

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
anything for contrast and we don't have

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.990 
anything for contrast and we don't have
to<00:01:36.810> give<00:01:36.960> any<00:01:37.140> injections<00:01:37.799> for<00:01:37.950> contrast<00:01:38.430> this

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
to give any injections for contrast this

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.990 
to give any injections for contrast this
keeps<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.540> skin<00:01:39.840> quite<00:01:40.259> simple<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:41.009> can<00:01:41.670> eat

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
keeps the skin quite simple you can eat

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.999 
keeps the skin quite simple you can eat
before<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.600> come<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:43.409> can<00:01:43.590> go<00:01:43.740> about<00:01:43.950> your

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
before you come you can go about your

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.310 
before you come you can go about your
usual<00:01:44.610> activities<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:45.689> therapist<00:01:46.140> will

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
usual activities the therapist will

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.960 
usual activities the therapist will
perform<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.890> skin<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.460> then<00:01:47.610> they<00:01:47.790> will

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
perform the skin and then they will

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.999 
perform the skin and then they will
bring<00:01:48.210> me<00:01:48.450> into<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.960> room<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.409> review<00:01:49.860> the
