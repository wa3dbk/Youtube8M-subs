00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello and welcome dear 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.560
 gaming friends my name reputable and 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.650
 Today 's a hardware video to the 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.929
 topic which gaming pc uses 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.670
 actually the sirius maybe recognizes 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.550
 here are the tenth in the video 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.460
 that is part of the unboxing videos 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:24.000
 been to my current housing 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.920
 choir very 600t in the special edition 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.019
 I already introduced white 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.820
 if you only see the housing video 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.180
 of course you can do that in the bottom of 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.680
 find the video description 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.600
 But beyond that was the question 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.489
 relatively large person what used 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.530
 ever for hardware and see here 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.899
 We actually my old hardware because 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.200
 I was here in Wuppertal at the company 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.629
 Txtr net kindly my pc 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.870
 has rebuilt and so we have just that 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:56.309
 old hardware components expanded and 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.469
 built into the new housing since corsa 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.109
 relatively often really the questions 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.600
 come what I use because it is 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.900
 now on hard drives to memory 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.430
 on graphics card what I do not know yet 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.590
 I have decided everything 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.750
 make you a slightly longer video 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.790
 where i can easily find ten from txtr here 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.470
 net we use there locally shot 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.450
 have how to housing new 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.860
 is screwed around you then 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.790
 at the same time a little something too 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.970
 to tell my hardware so for the first time 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.619
 I also overclock my cpu 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.220
 let that mean I'm currently using 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.200
 an i7 2700k so generally model what 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.820
 also meant for overclocking and 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.000
 is created and then I have 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.680
 can also be done there directly from 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.240
 professional so to speak yes you can completely here 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.000
 nice to look away from a normal 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.210
 gaming systems boni hold a lot like that 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.970
 hard core gaming stuff and workstations 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.470
 here gtx 590 two pieces of water cooled 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.570
 and things like that, we'll come 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.210
 back to my normal housing 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.869
 and want to my normal gaming pc 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.430
 I say 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.009
 So I'm mostly here on the 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.540
 profi because I myself still 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.630
 never much with this 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.940
 Assembly and conversion of pc 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.050
 and I give priority to it 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.940
 but also around 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.230
 the overclock went what i did then 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.600
 personally just prefer one 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.100
 let the professional do the whole thing 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.980
 for ten years or more 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.110
 professionally, we already see that 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.970
 pretty much my processes on the 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.400
 mainboard and that was one of the 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.170
 cpu-cooler we have tried 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.900
 first has only model of vertex 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.670
 selected or noctua stood to 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.160
 language but then it is a at the end 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.140
 alps early cooler and that remained 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.820
 Of course it was great that we did that 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.320
 immediately tried on the spot and to 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.780
 For example, the model noticed what 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.340
 would build a building just got us off 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.930
 the cooling capacity was not enough 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.740
 we afterwards again to a 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.900
 alpenföhn matterhorn have been changed 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:54.630
 After that, all the cables are packed perfectly 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.030
 there was a table around that 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.920
 device will run for the first time 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.530
 then let pass 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.690
 test it went on to overclocking 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.630
 station I would like to say where we stop 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.150
 step by step the device is overclocked 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.860
 have the great thing was actually that 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.660
 txtr net really every single step 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.489
 went through with me and then 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.860
 accordingly again the cpu-cooler 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.230
 has simply replaced again by yet 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:24.290
 higher and better performance 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:28.050
 to be able to reach home again 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:31.020
 Currently the computer is running at 4 6 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.180
 gigahertz for four days in the long run 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.920
 load operation and so far without 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.959
 any selection 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.090
 I do not want any more tips or 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.250
 give and become something to overclocking 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.750
 also no questions to answer because 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.000
 He certainly has his own 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.430
 Opinion as well to the components 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.709
 everyone wants to block or everyone 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.140
 So use this whole why this 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.180
 why that simply stays for everyone 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.180
 I'm left with the part as well 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.860
 I am absolutely satisfied with it now 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.400
 So we come back to the 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.209
 items that we have installed here 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.920
 the housing would have to be natural 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:08.070
 By now everyone knows that's just what 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.450
 the corsair graphite 600t in white 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.610
 very nice housing as I think 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.950
 however, there are front and top fans 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:18.570
 me too loud then we can here 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:21.359
 I sit on a court rtx 850 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.770
 power supply and beyond 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.860
 a total of three 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:29.129
 does not work with 120 gb ssd for that 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:32.370
 system windows 7 64bit I have a 240 

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:34.409
 gb ssd of kues he for games or 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.560
 records and just another one 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:40.500
 terabyte western digital plate all the way 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.090
 just a little something to secure 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:46.190
 I use a motherboard at the moment 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:48.120
 from asus namely the sabertooth p67 b3 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.460
 I already use this revision 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.500
 for a year and I'm really there 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.050
 satisfied with saw there at the moment no 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.520
 more reason to buy a new one 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.680
 Here we see the beautiful again 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.530
 Cable routing from the housing or like all 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.150
 beautiful on the back disappears yes 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.270
 the processor just hops here 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:09.960
 is cooled is now just the intel i7 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:12.180
 2700k pulled up to 4 6 gigahertz or 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:16.199
 the whole is currently from the same 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:18.150
 alpenföhn matterhorn cpu-cooler cooled 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:19.860
 at the moment still with a fan in front 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.240
 this is still running in my test at the moment 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.099
 if I would notice it would last forever 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.539
 I could be too hot in the back too 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:27.000
 a second fan on it 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:28.889
 screw in the heart of the advice 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.240
 so to speak that is the graphics card that 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:35.580
 is a gainward gtx 680 fans with 2 gb 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.490
 and underneath is the media 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:41.550
 live gamer hd I personally use 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:44.069
 eg to record xbox gameplay i 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.289
 really draw on the pc itself 

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:48.479
 normal program like fraps for example 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:50.909
 So on there I use the version of 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:52.050
 but media only for consoles 

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:54.469
 gameplay 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.819
 I use a normal samsung 

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:58.710
 DVD drive and it is actually synonymous 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:01.529
 already the main components 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.210
 I use 16 gigabytes of memory 

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:08.699
 I can say that's from Corsa, too 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:11.069
 this vengeance ddr3 1600 megahertz me 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:13.789
 support the whole participant or 

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:16.860
 Let's run it short 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:19.319
 ok the start button above the 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.300
 fan control pressed and already running 

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:22.860
 the good part yes I have the front too 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.389
 still in the digital fan control 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.460
 does not currently use 

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:29.279
 maybe I would do that if 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:31.909
 I exchange something at the fans 

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:34.949
 that they can control each other separately 

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:37.379
 yes, by and large it stays that way 

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:38.699
 main line up to at least until crysis 3 

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:40.740
 you could say now 

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:43.830
 So I'm really good with the part 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:46.379
 happy but who knows what else in 2013 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:48.060
 Everything will bring the third ssd 

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:49.319
 will be on everyone sooner or later 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:52.169
 come in case maybe come 

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:53.879
 a second gtx 680 doing other cpu 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:55.620
 would probably mean too 

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:57.090
 another motherboard that is relative 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:59.430
 difficult there I would rather times 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:03.090
 wait and see what the market in the next 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:06.169
 months so it looks like now 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:09.659
 every case from today's january 

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:10.560
 2013 this is my gaming and working pc 

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:12.120
 so to speak 

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.710
 I hope the video has you a whole 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.050
 little bit like a small one 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:17.879
 Insight given in what I just to 

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:19.650
 play or to the gameplay 

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:22.439
 record I thank you 

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:25.740
 heartily at the company txtr net 

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:28.199
 the me here at all questions the conversion 

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:31.050
 and very overclocking 

00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:33.599
 were yes, in the end only too 

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:39.020
 say nice that you have watched until 

00:07:33.599 --> 00:07:39.020
 Next time, shut up and skin in
