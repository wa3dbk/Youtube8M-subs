00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.509
 the caf and 01net directions 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.550
 now to test one of the big 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.730
 expected features of this galaxy s 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.269
 5 c sealing looks at a sink a 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.940
 galaxy s 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.289
 so far so good ooh there is a 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.940
 little cold you'll be cold my galaxy 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.100
 s 5 but I think it should go 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.590
 so that's it we dive into the water and 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:27.480
 we will see what will happen 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:29.340
 hop there then first thing you 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.619
 notice we can not actually use 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.329
 the underwater screen makes the functions 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.149
 touch are completely disabled 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.160
 but on the other hand you can if you 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.450
 want to take pictures the annoying years 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.350
 the camera I want to photograph 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.370
 the old ones at my age and I 'm going to do 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.850
 a very very beautiful photo you go 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:49.649
 see ok so here I plunge it into the water 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:53.809
 watched and so I'll launch a photo 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.809
 super photo does not have to quibble 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.220
 so in fact the camera works 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.660
 under water it can be nice if by 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.820
 example you are at the pool and that 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.210
 you want to photograph a friend that 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.160
 market 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.610
 on the other hand for the video we will do the 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:12.470
 test right away so I go into 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.470
 video and I always plunge the device 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:20.220
 is there the same way I can also 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.470
 filming under water so this galaxy s 5 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.410
 and actually waterproof and meets the standards 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.720
 well accurate which is the ip67 standard it 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.670
 is therefore protected against water against 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.090
 sand against sweat and against 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.800
 dust 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.990
 so how did samsung make to render 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.460
 his galaxy s 5 waterproof and well that's 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.170
 quite simple it is enough to actually remove 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.670
 the back shell and you go 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.520
 understand right away 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.250
 look good you have all around in 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.990
 makes this shell a seal that goes into 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.290
 has vital components protected 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.390
 smartphone electronics ie 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.070
 the battery and then we'll say the 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.560
 important electronic components and 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.110
 when you actually close this shell 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.930
 it will seal all this part 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.549
 it's pretty clever and that's 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.299
 so works bravo samsung thesis is 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.299
 actually successful
