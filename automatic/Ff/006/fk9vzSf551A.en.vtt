 0 but they note on several covers the real people as they go in unintentionally 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.890
 but the people who stay a little misplaced you never know how to interpret it to 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.650
 real time all will macará and 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.280

 say that it is always anecdotal rattle that appears on a screen 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.419
 contribution is that a camera that recorded what 

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:20.379
 imagine performance was of Gaddafi in which a time camera traces

 very calm as Saturday morning yes because the psoe expressed the 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.289
 necessary image quality for my character 

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:30.599
 esic is less than the required 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.679
 for the rest a screen appears 

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:37.059
 then it appears on the screen apparently in movies it is better to record it with a 

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:38.179
 camera or photos 

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:41.659

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.549

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.670
 lightning-colored beam of the division of the island ep / van to take a 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:59.609

 then at that moment it became clear that no 

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:26.379
 same thing was happening and and I knew that the material would be too harting 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:28.449
 like to make a good book that would sell 

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:32.909
 I turned to my friend and a stretcher is the one that has made the book really I do not 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:38.489

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:10.169
 it's so overwhelming that really in the end I had to do as a retreat 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:12.709
