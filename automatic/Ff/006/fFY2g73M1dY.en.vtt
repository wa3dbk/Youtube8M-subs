physics in milk you know yeah they're
not<00:00:36.059> really<00:00:36.270> thin<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:38.360> so<00:00:39.360> when<00:00:39.510> you<00:00:39.600> push

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
not really thin so so when you push

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.160 
not really thin so so when you push
through<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.500> disappears<00:00:41.870> black<00:00:42.870> white<00:00:43.020> is

every single one does the the latte art
and<00:02:28.550> that's<00:02:28.820> just<00:02:29.090> in<00:02:29.390> one<00:02:29.630> part<00:02:29.959> of<00:02:30.020> the<00:02:30.110> city

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
and that's just in one part of the city

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.130 
and that's just in one part of the city
and<00:02:30.920> then<00:02:31.400> it's<00:02:31.550> happening<00:02:31.940> in<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.239> middle<00:02:32.810> as

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
and then it's happening in the middle as

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.380 
and then it's happening in the middle as
well<00:02:33.320> and<00:02:33.680> in<00:02:33.890> spreading<00:02:34.250> so<00:02:35.120> what<00:02:35.270> we're

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
well and in spreading so what we're

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.570 
well and in spreading so what we're
doing<00:02:35.420> is<00:02:35.690> quite<00:02:35.959> niche<00:02:36.230> and<00:02:37.180> but<00:02:39.160> it's<00:02:40.160> going

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
doing is quite niche and but it's going

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.729 
doing is quite niche and but it's going
to<00:02:40.670> become<00:02:40.790> standard<00:02:42.519> one<00:02:43.519> question<00:02:44.739> what's

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
to become standard one question what's

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
different places that I mean going to is

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.590

coming<00:03:08.450> across<00:03:08.720> your<00:03:09.200> longer<00:03:09.590> I<00:03:09.940> I'd<00:03:10.940> never

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
coming across your longer I I'd never

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.130

seen<00:03:11.780> it<00:03:12.380> as<00:03:12.709> long<00:03:12.860> as<00:03:13.040> that<00:03:13.250> but<00:03:14.030> I<00:03:14.510> think

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
seen it as long as that but I think

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.039 
seen it as long as that but I think
given<00:03:15.890> the<00:03:15.920> right<00:03:16.220> coffee<00:03:16.549> and<00:03:16.970> you<00:03:17.840> should<00:03:18.019> be

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
given the right coffee and you should be

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:20.560 
given the right coffee and you should be
able<00:03:18.140> to<00:03:18.320> get<00:03:18.440> some<00:03:18.590> amazing<00:03:19.160> okay<00:03:19.970> Labour's<00:03:20.420> I

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
able to get some amazing okay Labour's I

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.430 
able to get some amazing okay Labour's I
think<00:03:20.959> we<00:03:21.470> can't<00:03:22.370> shut<00:03:22.730> her<00:03:22.910> mind<00:03:23.150> off<00:03:23.420> to<00:03:24.140> what

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
think we can't shut her mind off to what

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.120 
think we can't shut her mind off to what
an<00:03:24.680> espresso<00:03:25.070> is<00:03:25.459> and<00:03:25.730> and<00:03:26.799> there<00:03:27.799> is<00:03:27.920> this

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
an espresso is and and there is this

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.550 
an espresso is and and there is this
mindset<00:03:28.640> that<00:03:29.620> espresso<00:03:30.620> is<00:03:31.040> this<00:03:32.079> is<00:03:33.079> drink

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
mindset that espresso is this is drink

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.850 
mindset that espresso is this is drink
that<00:03:33.860> is<00:03:33.980> this<00:03:34.579> big<00:03:34.850> and<00:03:35.120> it's<00:03:35.269> exactly

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
that is this big and it's exactly

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.490 
that is this big and it's exactly
has<00:03:37.130> to<00:03:37.310> have<00:03:37.460> crema<00:03:37.790> and<00:03:38.060> creme<00:03:38.780> is<00:03:38.930> amazing

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
has to have crema and creme is amazing

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.660 
has to have crema and creme is amazing
and<00:03:40.390> then<00:03:41.390> you<00:03:41.900> guys<00:03:42.320> don't<00:03:42.920> do<00:03:43.130> your<00:03:43.280> longer

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
and then you guys don't do your longer

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.080 
and then you guys don't do your longer
and<00:03:44.420> that's<00:03:44.690> completely<00:03:45.680> different<00:03:46.190> and<00:03:46.370> I

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
and that's completely different and I

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.020 
and that's completely different and I
think<00:03:47.470> we<00:03:48.470> need<00:03:48.650> to<00:03:48.770> open<00:03:48.800> our<00:03:49.130> minds<00:03:49.400> and<00:03:49.760> play

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
think we need to open our minds and play

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.970 
think we need to open our minds and play
with<00:03:50.180> flavors<00:03:50.780> that<00:03:50.810> you<00:03:51.080> can<00:03:51.410> get<00:03:51.650> from

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 
you can put in something like a an

you can put in something like a an
Ethiopian<00:04:21.950> coffee<00:04:22.760> and<00:04:23.410> and<00:04:24.730> nice<00:04:25.730> and<00:04:26.000> long<00:04:26.240> I

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
Ethiopian coffee and and nice and long I

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.090 
Ethiopian coffee and and nice and long I
didn't<00:04:27.050> have<00:04:27.230> really<00:04:27.620> nice<00:04:29.410> flavors<00:04:30.410> it<00:04:30.890> could

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
didn't have really nice flavors it could

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.150 
didn't have really nice flavors it could
be<00:04:31.419> could<00:04:32.419> be<00:04:32.480> amazing<00:04:32.810> because<00:04:33.770> you<00:04:34.070> have

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
be could be amazing because you have

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.100 
be could be amazing because you have
more<00:04:34.370> water<00:04:34.669> you<00:04:34.790> have<00:04:34.970> more<00:04:35.300> total<00:04:35.720> dissolved

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
more water you have more total dissolved

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.620 
more water you have more total dissolved
solids<00:04:36.140> like<00:04:36.800> the<00:04:37.040> oils<00:04:37.400> and<00:04:37.640> everything<00:04:38.030> so

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
solids like the oils and everything so

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.200 
solids like the oils and everything so
the<00:04:38.750> coffee<00:04:38.960> will<00:04:39.200> always<00:04:39.500> be<00:04:39.740> a<00:04:39.770> light<00:04:40.550> crisp

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
the coffee will always be a light crisp

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.360 
the coffee will always be a light crisp
something<00:04:41.870> light<00:04:42.050> and<00:04:42.080> crisp<00:04:42.500> yeah<00:04:42.890> yeah<00:04:43.160> and

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
something light and crisp yeah yeah and

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:44.920 
something light and crisp yeah yeah and
because<00:04:43.520> it's<00:04:43.910> not<00:04:44.120> as<00:04:44.330> thick<00:04:44.630> and

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
because it's not as thick and

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.830 
because it's not as thick and
concentrated<00:04:45.800> so<00:04:46.340> maybe<00:04:46.610> that<00:04:47.000> its<00:04:47.240> agreement

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
concentrated so maybe that its agreement

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.810 
concentrated so maybe that its agreement
that<00:04:48.200> will<00:04:48.680> work<00:04:48.890> really<00:04:49.100> well<00:04:49.250> and<00:04:49.669> that's

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
that will work really well and that's

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.280 
that will work really well and that's
what<00:04:50.060> a<00:04:50.090> lot<00:04:50.240> of<00:04:50.300> people<00:04:50.390> like<00:04:50.750> in<00:04:50.900> home<00:04:51.020> as
