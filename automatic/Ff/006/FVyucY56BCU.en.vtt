00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:08.060
 hi this is a new review about 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.310
 this wireless keyboard 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:13.660
 that we can buy in the different 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:16.550
 Korean stores east 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:19.480
 particularly has no mark 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:25.660
 it's a pretty generic model 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:27.369
 in fact we are and what marks us but 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.880
 Well the interesting thing about this device is 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.009
 what 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.450
 has internal matter or is it 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.450
 recharge for a mini usb 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.170
 and somehow 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.120
 that is, its main function is that it is a 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.879
 wireless keyboard of this 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.859
 feature of this size the keyboard 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.909
 connects to the computer through 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:49.909
 this port of light 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.910
 that pendrive or gift that you leave it 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.010
 plugged into the windows usb came from 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.540
 ethical of at least windows 7 detected it 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.090
 immediately and what has been installed 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.430
 the drivers and good and from here you can 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.860
 control your computer the good thing is that 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.330
 It also has a mouse area here 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.160
 that this is the tactile part from the 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.410
 control field to arrow in the 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.150
 secondary primary buttons and also 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.250
 are the arrows on the keyboard 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.500
 in functions the keyboard itself 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.500
 said is with the distribution of keys 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.100
 which is the same as the original keyboard 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.049
 and this 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.970
 the house blinking at this moment because 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:31.960
 is waiting for a signal or is it not 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.960
 I have no side 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:41.220
 until the climatic strip lit and extinguished 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.170
 good this keyboard I'm using it 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.270
 quite some time the truth that responds 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.649
 pretty good is not for obviously for 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.270
 play video games but it's for 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.460
 when you are lying on the couch and 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.000
 do you want to change a movie or 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.799
 because you want to navigate because he did not have 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.630
 wind two more teams for this kind of 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.220
 tasks is but the truth is that 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.990
 prepared for all in fact have the 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.509
 function keys here you can download upload 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.130
 the volume you have the key every 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.039
 control delete if you want to block 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.929
 a machine to reset the key 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.600
 Windows really is quite 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.610
 complete the scope should be in the 10 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.060
 meters more or less so it has a 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.580
 you are quite a center 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.520
 as it is what you do not learn about 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.230
 one that is learned you have keyboard 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.120
 you also have possibilities that have 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.190
 lights the background keyboard if it's night 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.690
 you light up this keyboard folder and 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.520
 we put others that the truth is 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.980
 pretty good that function 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.830
 and finally among those functions that 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.950
 they bring this kind of Chinese things and 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:43.420
 certainly so they are to be pretty 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.930
 Capador has enough energy 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.030
 and good to download usb I think it's 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.290
 a very good advantage because in fact what 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.840
 makes the device lighter 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.489
 you need batteries and also that you have the 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.959
 convenience that you do not have that you do not have 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.880
 never that material you leave loading a 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.980
 about 34 hours and it will be 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.239
 completely and I calculate that the 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.620
 Battery life should be 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:07.239
 around 8 10 hours of use not 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.950
 had already lit with equal sums 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.120
 you leave the sound by element that I have 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.370
 about the battery now obviously be 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.349
 always also turn it off when 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.250
 they have detected us that windows so no 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:21.720
 is a problem 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.720
 this wireless keyboard 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.129
 but that taste
