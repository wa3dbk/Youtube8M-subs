in my other video um if you didn't see
that<00:00:11.880> look<00:00:12.300> it<00:00:12.420> up<00:00:12.540> it's<00:00:13.170> real<00:00:13.349> simple<00:00:13.679> she<00:00:14.250> so

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
that look it up it's real simple she so

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.099 
that look it up it's real simple she so
what<00:00:15.210> we're<00:00:15.330> gonna<00:00:15.389> do<00:00:15.599> is<00:00:15.690> we're<00:00:15.839> gonna<00:00:15.900> use

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
what we're gonna do is we're gonna use

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.750 
what we're gonna do is we're gonna use
the<00:00:16.199> sticky<00:00:16.470> talked<00:00:16.650> about<00:00:16.949> this<00:00:17.160> tire<00:00:17.460> now

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
the sticky talked about this tire now

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.269 
the sticky talked about this tire now
why<00:00:18.330> do<00:00:18.390> you<00:00:18.480> want<00:00:18.570> balance<00:00:18.990> tires<00:00:19.199> make<00:00:20.130> it

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
why do you want balance tires make it

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.040 
why do you want balance tires make it
more<00:00:20.430> stable<00:00:20.730> at<00:00:20.939> speed<00:00:21.270> will<00:00:21.660> make<00:00:21.900> your

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
more stable at speed will make your

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.509 
more stable at speed will make your
tires<00:00:22.289> wear<00:00:22.619> more<00:00:22.859> evenly

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
tires wear more evenly

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.330 
tires wear more evenly
it<00:00:23.850> won't<00:00:24.060> wear<00:00:24.240> out<00:00:24.269> as<00:00:24.570> quick<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:26.070> could

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
it won't wear out as quick and it could

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.849 
it won't wear out as quick and it could
cause<00:00:26.519> less<00:00:26.820> crashes<00:00:27.359> because<00:00:27.689> it's<00:00:28.680> more

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
cause less crashes because it's more

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.980 
cause less crashes because it's more
stable<00:00:29.070> at<00:00:29.250> high<00:00:29.400> speed<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:30.060> I<00:00:30.359> definitely

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
stable at high speed and I definitely

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.139 
stable at high speed and I definitely
noticed<00:00:31.320> like<00:00:31.800> right<00:00:32.070> now<00:00:32.219> with<00:00:32.279> these<00:00:32.850> tires

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
noticed like right now with these tires

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.080 
noticed like right now with these tires
that<00:00:33.450> aren't<00:00:33.719> balanced<00:00:34.050> my<00:00:34.200> wrestler<00:00:34.620> is

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
that aren't balanced my wrestler is

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.290 
that aren't balanced my wrestler is
extremely<00:00:36.090> jumpy<00:00:36.480> in<00:00:36.600> walking<00:00:36.960> so<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:38.300> wanna

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
extremely jumpy in walking so you wanna

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.160 
extremely jumpy in walking so you wanna
balance<00:00:39.480> these<00:00:39.750> tires<00:00:40.079> just<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:40.770> they<00:00:42.170> that

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
balance these tires just so they that

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.139 
balance these tires just so they that
the<00:00:43.350> car<00:00:43.559> has<00:00:44.010> better<00:00:44.280> performance<00:00:44.370> overall

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
the car has better performance overall

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.760 
the car has better performance overall
so<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.110> know<00:00:46.230> it's<00:00:46.590> not<00:00:46.800> at<00:00:47.190> all<00:00:47.270> balanced<00:00:48.770> it

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
so you know it's not at all balanced it

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.119 
so you know it's not at all balanced it
doesn't<00:00:50.190> spin<00:00:51.620> easily

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
doesn't spin easily

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.119 
doesn't spin easily
there's<00:00:53.730> obviously<00:00:54.110> heavy<00:00:55.110> spot<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.890> right

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
there's obviously heavy spot is right

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.040 
there's obviously heavy spot is right
here<00:00:56.370> because<00:00:56.520> that's<00:00:56.850> it's<00:00:57.480> spinning<00:00:57.899> to

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
here because that's it's spinning to

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.319 
here because that's it's spinning to
there<00:00:58.199> so<00:00:58.410> we<00:00:58.530> want<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.859> put<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.820> sticky<00:01:00.059> tack

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
there so we want to put the sticky tack

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.590 
there so we want to put the sticky tack
on<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.660> opposite<00:01:01.079> side<00:01:01.289> up<00:01:01.469> there<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:02.570> okay<00:01:03.570> I

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
on the opposite side up there so okay I

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.120 
on the opposite side up there so okay I
get<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.930> little<00:01:04.290> bit<00:01:04.500> sticky<00:01:04.769> talk<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.250> start

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
get a little bit sticky talk to start

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.980 
get a little bit sticky talk to start
stick<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.310> right<00:01:08.549> up<00:01:08.820> there<00:01:09.030> preferably<00:01:09.689> right

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
stick it right up there preferably right

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.570 
stick it right up there preferably right
by<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.970> spoke<00:01:11.970> on<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.330> tire<00:01:12.920> that<00:01:13.920> way<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.520> just

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
by a spoke on the tire that way it just

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.670 
by a spoke on the tire that way it just
got<00:01:15.180> more<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.570> stick<00:01:15.840> against<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.530> it

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
got more to stick against and it

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.840 
got more to stick against and it
probably<00:01:16.979> won't<00:01:17.220> fall<00:01:17.460> out<00:01:17.490> as<00:01:17.790> easy<00:01:18.110> so<00:01:19.850> now

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
probably won't fall out as easy so now

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.260 
probably won't fall out as easy so now
try<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.810> again<00:01:21.990> spin<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.830> tire<00:01:23.040> again

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:37.370 

definitely<00:01:28.200> better<00:01:28.820> definitely

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.970 

still<00:01:38.250> got<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.550> bit<00:01:38.760> of<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.940> heavy<00:01:39.150> spot<00:01:39.480> so<00:01:39.980> take

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:40.980 
still got a bit of a heavy spot so take

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:49.899 
still got a bit of a heavy spot so take
a<00:01:41.010> bit<00:01:41.250> more<00:01:41.520> sticky<00:01:41.880> tack

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:51.990 

so<00:01:50.450> obviously<00:01:50.930> these<00:01:51.140> times<00:01:51.469> are<00:01:51.590> really

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
so obviously these times are really

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.779 
so obviously these times are really
unbalanced<00:01:53.530> there<00:01:54.530> the<00:01:54.619> stock<00:01:54.920> tires<00:01:55.219> to<00:01:55.700> be

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
unbalanced there the stock tires to be

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:15.910 
unbalanced there the stock tires to be
expected

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.950 

all<00:02:16.400> right<00:02:16.520> just<00:02:16.910> take<00:02:17.360> a<00:02:17.390> little<00:02:17.630> bit<00:02:17.810> more

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
all right just take a little bit more

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.530 
all right just take a little bit more
sticky<00:02:18.410> tack<00:02:18.710> in<00:02:18.920> there<00:02:19.300> so<00:02:20.300> I've<00:02:20.390> actually

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
sticky tack in there so I've actually

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.690 
sticky tack in there so I've actually
got<00:02:20.780> a<00:02:20.930> fair<00:02:21.200> bit<00:02:21.380> sticky<00:02:21.740> tack<00:02:21.920> in<00:02:22.069> there<00:02:22.220> it

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
got a fair bit sticky tack in there it

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.070 
got a fair bit sticky tack in there it
would<00:02:22.880> be<00:02:23.000> better<00:02:23.150> if<00:02:23.330> I<00:02:23.420> I'll<00:02:23.810> probably

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
would be better if I I'll probably

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:42.700 
would be better if I I'll probably
spread<00:02:24.500> it<00:02:24.650> out<00:02:24.770> among<00:02:25.370> these<00:02:25.610> two<00:02:25.790> spokes

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.060 

much<00:02:43.710> better<00:02:44.070> now<00:02:44.400> than<00:02:44.820> when<00:02:44.970> I<00:02:45.030> started<00:02:46.070> so

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
much better now than when I started so

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.710 
much better now than when I started so
that's<00:02:47.400> how<00:02:47.550> you<00:02:47.610> balance<00:02:47.970> your<00:02:48.060> tires

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
that's how you balance your tires

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.690 
that's how you balance your tires
I'll<00:02:49.170> give<00:02:49.470> you<00:02:49.650> way<00:02:49.860> better<00:02:50.070> performance<00:02:50.580> in

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
I'll give you way better performance in

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.910 
I'll give you way better performance in
your<00:02:50.760> car<00:02:51.050> it's<00:02:52.050> definitely<00:02:52.710> worthwhile

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
your car it's definitely worthwhile

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.850
