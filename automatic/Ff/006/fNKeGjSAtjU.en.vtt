 The Secret of Provence Ochres 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.400
 Okhra, Conservatory of Ocher and Color 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.200
 In the 1990s, my wife Barbara and I 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.300
 were looking for an old factory to do a project on the transmission of know-how. 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.500
 One day we discovered the village of Roussillon, 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 then this magic space, abandoned. 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.500
 The chance we have in Roussillon is to have a village that is complete on the history of the oceans. 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.500
 We have the Ocher Trail, which receives 200,000 visitors a year. 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.000
 The Ocher Trail is the height of the old ocher quarries. 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.000
 Quarries from which ore was extracted and logically brought to the mill. 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.300
 This is where the pigment was made from the oily sand. 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.600
 And once we have this matter, we will come back to the village. 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.500
 The village is built in two ways: 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:23.500
 on the one hand we used the sands of the washing that was going to be thrown away to make the coatings. 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.500
 For coatings the colors are already very strong! 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:33.200
 And then finally the pigment could be used to fresco or whitewash to protect the coatings of the village. 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.100
 After the 1860s, the Vaucluse will become the first ocher producing region in France 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.500
 thanks to the railway that connected Cavaillon to Digne. 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.000
 Ocher will be exported around the world. 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.600
 In 1929 40,000 tons of ochres were exported. 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.600
 This material has been used for 350,000 years in the history of Humanity, 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.500
 she accompanied him so that Man is Man. 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.600
 For 40 years the factory was producing ocher 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.500
 and since 1995, we are a cooperative that manufactures services around color. 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.500
