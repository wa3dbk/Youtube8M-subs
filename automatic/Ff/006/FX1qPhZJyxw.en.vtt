competitive map we're playing here with

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.640 
competitive map we're playing here with
2<00:00:29.310> v2<00:00:29.490> there<00:00:30.000> you<00:00:30.090> can<00:00:30.150> probably<00:00:30.539> try<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.810> 1v1<00:00:31.260> or

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
2 v2 there you can probably try a 1v1 or

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.069 
2 v2 there you can probably try a 1v1 or
maybe<00:00:31.800> even<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.040> fall<00:00:32.250> before<00:00:32.809> but<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:33.899> might

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
maybe even a fall before but that might

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.979 
maybe even a fall before but that might
get<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.290> bit<00:00:34.469> hectic<00:00:35.040> or<00:00:35.640> cramps<00:00:36.300> depending<00:00:36.989> on

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
get a bit hectic or cramps depending on

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.590 
get a bit hectic or cramps depending on
the<00:00:37.290> player<00:00:37.500> size<00:00:37.820> 2<00:00:38.820> v2<00:00:39.000> seemed<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.510> work

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
the player size 2 v2 seemed to work

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.330 
the player size 2 v2 seemed to work
pretty<00:00:39.660> well<00:00:39.930> on<00:00:40.230> this<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.649> I<00:00:40.890> think<00:00:40.950> that

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
pretty well on this and I think that

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.280 
pretty well on this and I think that
might<00:00:41.489> be<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.670> only<00:00:41.850> things<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:42.629> the

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
might be the only things is that the

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.950 
might be the only things is that the
spawns<00:00:43.559> can<00:00:43.770> actually<00:00:44.010> support<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:44.700> yeah<00:00:45.510> 2v2

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
spawns can actually support so yeah 2v2

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
spawns can actually support so yeah 2v2
that's<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:47.129> way<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.309> go<00:00:47.550> on<00:00:47.670> this<00:00:48.710> viet<00:00:49.710> so

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
that's the way to go on this viet so

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.459 
that's the way to go on this viet so
this<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.399> we're<00:00:50.850> playing<00:00:51.090> here<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.629> v2<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:52.170> be

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
this is we're playing here to v2 is be

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.770 
this is we're playing here to v2 is be
ours<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.879> actually<00:00:54.390> ended<00:00:54.570> up<00:00:54.629> working

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
ours and that actually ended up working

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.170 
ours and that actually ended up working
pretty<00:00:55.140> well<00:00:55.199> as<00:00:56.160> you'll<00:00:56.489> see<00:00:56.610> more<00:00:56.760> begin<00:00:57.059> to

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
pretty well as you'll see more begin to

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.910 
pretty well as you'll see more begin to
the<00:00:57.270> gameplay<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.780> map<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.170> quite<00:00:58.469> open<00:00:58.859> in

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
the gameplay the map is quite open in

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.830 
the gameplay the map is quite open in
places<00:00:59.340> isn't<00:00:59.640> quite<00:00:59.820> some<00:01:00.030> lot<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.449> there's

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
places isn't quite some lot that there's

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.349 
places isn't quite some lot that there's
some<00:01:01.020> quite<00:01:01.980> long<00:01:02.160> sight<00:01:02.460> lines<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.090> so<00:01:03.180> one

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
some quite long sight lines and so one

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.820 
some quite long sight lines and so one
of<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.480> biggest<00:01:03.629> things<00:01:03.899> this<00:01:04.049> map<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.470> being

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
of the biggest things this map is being

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.219 
of the biggest things this map is being
able<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.100> position<00:01:05.309> yourself<00:01:05.900> see<00:01:06.900> here's<00:01:07.140> a

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
able to position yourself see here's a

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.750 
able to position yourself see here's a
really<00:01:07.619> long<00:01:07.770> sight<00:01:08.040> lines<00:01:08.250> trying<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.610> cross

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
really long sight lines trying to cross

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.990 
really long sight lines trying to cross
map<00:01:09.000> each<00:01:09.150> other<00:01:10.460> via<00:01:11.460> being<00:01:11.790> able<00:01:11.939> to

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
map each other via being able to

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.100 
map each other via being able to
position<00:01:12.180> yourself<00:01:12.630> so<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.990> you're

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
position yourself so that you're

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
interesting routes and between them you

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:41.990 
interesting routes and between them you
got<00:01:40.950> everything<00:01:41.189> from<00:01:41.280> man<00:01:41.490> cannons<00:01:41.909> to

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
got everything from man cannons to

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.149 
got everything from man cannons to
ramped<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.570> few<00:01:42.810> trick<00:01:43.200> jumps<00:01:43.590> as<00:01:43.710> well<00:01:43.860> and

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
ramped to a few trick jumps as well and

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.210 
ramped to a few trick jumps as well and
so<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.270> way<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:46.590> various<00:01:46.860> parts<00:01:47.100> might

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
so the way that the various parts might

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.469 
so the way that the various parts might
interact<00:01:47.520> with<00:01:47.790> each<00:01:47.820> other<00:01:48.000> is<00:01:48.210> actually

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
interact with each other is actually

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.210 
interact with each other is actually
really<00:01:48.630> really<00:01:48.780> cool<00:01:49.079> you'll<00:01:49.590> find<00:01:49.740> soft<00:01:50.040> just

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
really really cool you'll find soft just

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.679 
really really cool you'll find soft just
constantly<00:01:50.640> moving<00:01:50.880> around<00:01:51.090> trying<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.570> find

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
constantly moving around trying to find

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.410 
constantly moving around trying to find
a<00:01:51.840> position<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.259> kind<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.530> flank<00:01:53.420> your

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
a position to kind of flank your

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.730 
a position to kind of flank your
opponent<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:54.960> then<00:01:55.290> you'll<00:01:55.439> end<00:01:55.619> up

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
opponent and then you'll end up

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.720 
middle of that bridge just there which
I'm<00:02:26.400> just<00:02:26.640> rotating<00:02:27.420> around<00:02:27.540> right<00:02:28.380> there

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
I'm just rotating around right there

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.190 
I'm just rotating around right there
which<00:02:29.730> does<00:02:30.060> require<00:02:30.300> a<00:02:30.390> trick<00:02:30.660> jump<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:31.050> get

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
which does require a trick jump to get

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.410 
which does require a trick jump to get
up<00:02:31.320> through<00:02:31.500> it<00:02:32.000> those<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.120> only<00:02:33.270> power

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
up through it those the only power

up through it those the only power
weapons<00:02:33.750> on<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:33.960> map<00:02:34.170> though<00:02:34.760> they<00:02:35.760> all<00:02:36.000> come

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
weapons on the map though they all come

weapons on the map though they all come
in<00:02:36.870> very<00:02:37.200> useful<00:02:37.400> they'll<00:02:38.400> definitely<00:02:39.330> a<00:02:39.990> very

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
in very useful they'll definitely a very

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
this map depending on how you play and

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.170 
this map depending on how you play and
just<00:02:46.680> generally<00:02:47.070> the<00:02:47.190> BRS<00:02:47.640> can<00:02:47.760> do<00:02:47.910> quite<00:02:48.150> a

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
just generally the BRS can do quite a

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.990 
just generally the BRS can do quite a
lot<00:02:48.270> of<00:02:48.480> work<00:02:48.660> if<00:02:49.020> you're<00:02:49.350> not<00:02:49.560> careful<00:02:50.000> with

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
lot of work if you're not careful with

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.800 
lot of work if you're not careful with
what<00:02:51.030> I<00:02:51.180> mentioned<00:02:51.510> earlier<00:02:51.600> about

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
what I mentioned earlier about

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.570 
what I mentioned earlier about
positioning<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:52.620> of<00:02:52.950> course<00:02:52.980> you've<00:02:53.340> always

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
positioning and of course you've always

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.950 
positioning and of course you've always
got<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.820> good<00:02:53.970> old<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.270> the<00:02:54.630> good<00:02:54.780> old

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
got the good old to the good old

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.350 
got the good old to the good old
fashioned<00:02:55.470> halo<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:56.100> nuke<00:02:56.580> grenades<00:02:57.090> that

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
fashioned halo to nuke grenades that

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.570 
fashioned halo to nuke grenades that
just<00:02:57.510> do<00:02:57.630> a<00:02:57.660> seeming<00:02:58.620> crap<00:02:58.980> ton<00:02:59.190> amount<00:02:59.490> of

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
just do a seeming crap ton amount of

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.430 
just do a seeming crap ton amount of
damage<00:02:59.880> which<00:03:00.660> is<00:03:00.810> quite<00:03:00.960> cool<00:03:01.170> if<00:03:01.260> you<00:03:01.320> can

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
damage which is quite cool if you can

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.410 
damage which is quite cool if you can
bounce<00:03:01.590> it<00:03:01.860> off<00:03:01.950> several<00:03:02.250> of<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.520> M<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:03.180> walls

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
bounce it off several of the M the walls

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.650 
bounce it off several of the M the walls
in<00:03:03.720> this<00:03:03.900> map<00:03:04.430> yeah<00:03:05.430> all<00:03:05.700> in<00:03:05.850> all<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.240> map<00:03:06.420> is

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
in this map yeah all in all the map is

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.620 
in this map yeah all in all the map is
pretty<00:03:07.410> damn<00:03:07.590> solid<00:03:07.890> you've<00:03:08.520> got<00:03:08.760> good<00:03:09.120> mix<00:03:09.390> of

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
pretty damn solid you've got good mix of

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.750 
pretty damn solid you've got good mix of
open<00:03:10.020> areas<00:03:10.410> and<00:03:10.560> some<00:03:10.710> close<00:03:11.070> quarter<00:03:11.460> areas

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
with that shotgun that preachers picked

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.590 
with that shotgun that preachers picked
up<00:03:13.440> there<00:03:13.650> can<00:03:14.640> come<00:03:14.790> in<00:03:14.940> very<00:03:14.970> useful<00:03:15.210> indeed

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
up there can come in very useful indeed

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.990 
up there can come in very useful indeed
also<00:03:16.320> if<00:03:16.380> you<00:03:16.470> get<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:16.740> drop<00:03:16.920> on<00:03:17.100> someone<00:03:17.550> jump

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
also if you get the drop on someone jump

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.580 
also if you get the drop on someone jump
by<00:03:18.180> jumping<00:03:18.540> down<00:03:18.690> one<00:03:18.959> of<00:03:19.050> these<00:03:19.140> vertical

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
by jumping down one of these vertical

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.210 
by jumping down one of these vertical
levels<00:03:19.920> that<00:03:20.790> can<00:03:20.850> also<00:03:21.090> be<00:03:21.180> quite<00:03:21.480> useful

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
levels that can also be quite useful

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.410 
levels that can also be quite useful
once<00:03:23.220> again<00:03:23.700> we<00:03:23.790> go<00:03:23.880> back<00:03:23.910> to<00:03:24.060> our<00:03:24.180> noble

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
for the map we definitely had a lot of

fun playing this game and it definitely
didn't<00:03:35.610> turn<00:03:35.820> out<00:03:36.000> to<00:03:36.240> be<00:03:36.360> one<00:03:36.510> sided<00:03:36.780> at<00:03:37.140> all

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350
