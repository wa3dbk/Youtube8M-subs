00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.180
 hello with you test I'm tanya 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:10.400
 green 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:13.100
 what could be more beautiful than freshly squeezed 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.740
 orange juice in the morning in stores 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:19.310
 there are models like 300 rubles so 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.109
 and for 15,000, well, cheaper to talk 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.849
 Probably we will not likely this not 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:25.009
 reliable technology can be with no 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:26.929
 quality plastic and dear me 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:29.269
 I hope we will talk in some 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:31.130
 from the following reviews 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.290
 attention to models are average for the price 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.760
 famous manufacturers in our test 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.570
 today three models 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:42.830
 this is philips 2744 per thousand rubles this 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:46.180
 Brown 22 model for 2000 rubles and Pembroke 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:48.950
 300 she also costs 2000 rubles 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.320
 consider philips from all models she 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.150
 the least powerful 25 watts is just 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.960
 consumes but for full citrus 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.890
 juicers it and not so scary and 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.680
 the only model presented 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.440
 has a special capacity for collecting juice 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.269
 consider how it is arranged we shoot 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.400
 special dust cover on the cover 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.020
 it is only needed for storage see 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.500
 here is the cone nozzle itself 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:15.020
 which squeezes out juice also in this model 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.900
 a separator is provided so that we 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.090
 could choose the desired thickness of the juice 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.280
 the pulp either remain in this containers 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.770
 either in more passes in 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.780
 a bowl for hearing people here with this 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.200
 pens we can adjust the size 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:33.260
 openings we directly cup itself 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.320
 for juice from it we subsequently into a glass 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.810
 pour juice ready let's 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.330
 we will prepare orange juice in advance 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.890
 cut in halves to 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.920
 Turn on this device only 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.799
 plug the socket into the work 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.920
 will be from your click we attach 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:54.530
 orange 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.530
 Click and we have a beautiful soup 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.600
 it works in reverse mode that is in 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.570
 that and the other side can rotate 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.890
 this allows you most effectively 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.890
 remove the pulp from under the peel 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.490
 Here we see that the pulp is completely 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.100
 used in this orange and the juice is whole 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.640
 stayed in the cup see next 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.430
 model 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.800
 brown also it is designed for 60 watts 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.580
 she also has counter age 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:25.840
 field cap it is needed for storage 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.650
 cone nozzle itself and 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.180
 accordingly, she has such 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.190
 reception is not but she has a cup for soup 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.960
 let's see how it works 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.960
 collected in the reverse order set 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.270
 the glass under the spout here is the capacity 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.530
 only your used take also 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.390
 half an orange 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.780
 of course it can be a grapefruit can 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.930
 be a lemon anything and press 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.930
 the juice 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.520
 works as fast and efficiently 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.620
 Well, we see that in contrast to the Phillips 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.050
 reverse mode that is back to care 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.700
 This model is therefore not on the skin 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.130
 left a little flesh 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.130
 but in this model there is a very interesting 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:12.010
 digging valve we can wears 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.050
 lift and then the excess juice they will 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:18.040
 run down on the table if you are a glass 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:20.340
 already removed consider the Pembroke model in 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.100
 difference from previous models she 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.620
 heavier heavier looks 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.459
 impressively though the design is the same as 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:33.040
 Brown vs pain cap remove 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:36.070
 cone nozzle separator pulp and 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.290
 proper pulp receiver 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:42.310
 through the carry will pour out your juice 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.470
 a glass of power and and 100 watts the greatest 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:50.110
 let's check play or this 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:52.090
 some role we take our orange also 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.280
 use our own glass here 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:58.410
 By the way, there is also a key for digging up 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.410
 and try to squeeze 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.130
 also we see that the reverse mode and in 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:06.380
 This model is not see what we have 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:13.340
 will be with pulp how effective is it 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:15.770
 press off like we survived everything we could 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.720
 I want to say that a little pulp too 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.820
 left here you see for yourself 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.670
 despite the fact that these models are more 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.710
 dear most effective turned 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:27.830
 philips flesh she survived more 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:30.470
 and it seems to me to use it easier plus 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.240
 ability to adjust the amount 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.030
 the pulp in the juice seems to me too 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.010
 important but in any case testing 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.050
 you choose but before you buy 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.770
 see test and subscribe to
