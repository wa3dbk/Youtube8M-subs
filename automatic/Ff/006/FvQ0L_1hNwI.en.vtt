great<00:00:46.910> when<00:00:47.120> I<00:00:47.180> play<00:00:47.390> my<00:00:47.540> hi-hat<00:00:47.750> the<00:00:48.500> sound

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
great when I play my hi-hat the sound

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:50.170 
great when I play my hi-hat the sound
comes<00:00:48.980> from<00:00:49.010> over<00:00:49.340> here<00:00:49.610> when<00:00:49.790> I<00:00:49.820> play<00:00:50.030> the

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
comes from over here when I play the

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.150 
comes from over here when I play the
ride<00:00:50.329> cymbal<00:00:50.780> it<00:00:51.110> comes<00:00:51.350> from<00:00:51.500> over<00:00:51.710> there<00:00:51.890> and

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
ride cymbal it comes from over there and

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.280 
ride cymbal it comes from over there and
then<00:00:52.579> I<00:00:52.670> got<00:00:52.790> a<00:00:52.850> lot<00:00:53.030> of<00:00:53.060> nice<00:00:53.300> low-end<00:00:53.930> warmth

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
then I got a lot of nice low-end warmth

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.340 
then I got a lot of nice low-end warmth
from<00:00:54.710> the<00:00:54.770> subwoofer<00:00:55.280> back<00:00:55.610> here<00:00:55.910> as<00:00:56.030> well<00:00:56.350> the

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
from the subwoofer back here as well the

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.650 
from the subwoofer back here as well the
system<00:00:57.680> is<00:00:57.770> very<00:00:57.950> versatile<00:00:58.550> so<00:00:59.210> for<00:00:59.360> example

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
system is very versatile so for example

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.209 
system is very versatile so for example
if<00:00:59.750> I'm<00:00:59.870> playing<00:01:00.050> in<00:01:00.230> a<00:01:00.320> small<00:01:00.620> environment

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
if I'm playing in a small environment

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:03.190 
if I'm playing in a small environment
and<00:01:01.430> I<00:01:01.520> want<00:01:01.760> to<00:01:01.910> I<00:01:02.120> can<00:01:02.390> turn<00:01:02.600> these<00:01:02.750> satellite

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:03.200 
and I want to I can turn these satellite

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.920 
and I want to I can turn these satellite
speakers<00:01:03.469> out<00:01:04.070> so<00:01:04.699> that<00:01:04.939> you<00:01:05.390> out<00:01:05.540> there<00:01:05.750> could

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
speakers out so that you out there could

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.219 
speakers out so that you out there could
hear<00:01:06.110> it<00:01:06.259> but<00:01:06.860> then<00:01:07.100> with<00:01:07.520> my<00:01:07.670> subwoofer<00:01:08.270> I<00:01:08.450> can

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
hear it but then with my subwoofer I can

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.200 
hear it but then with my subwoofer I can
actually<00:01:09.350> put<00:01:09.680> it<00:01:09.770> into<00:01:09.860> full<00:01:10.130> range<00:01:10.460> mode<00:01:10.850> so

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
actually put it into full range mode so

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.940 
actually put it into full range mode so
I<00:01:11.240> can<00:01:11.329> actually<00:01:11.750> hear<00:01:11.930> some<00:01:12.110> high-end<00:01:12.560> coming

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
I can actually hear some high-end coming

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.730 
I can actually hear some high-end coming
from<00:01:13.069> that<00:01:13.249> as<00:01:13.490> well<00:01:13.520> so<00:01:14.420> really<00:01:15.380> neat<00:01:15.530> system

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
from that as well so really neat system

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.849 
from that as well so really neat system
the<00:01:16.520> subwoofer<00:01:16.999> also<00:01:17.299> has<00:01:17.509> three<00:01:18.200> channels<00:01:18.679> on

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:18.859 
the subwoofer also has three channels on

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:20.800 
the subwoofer also has three channels on
it<00:01:19.039> so<00:01:19.219> I<00:01:19.249> can<00:01:19.520> you<00:01:19.759> know<00:01:19.880> plug<00:01:20.329> at<00:01:20.450> least<00:01:20.600> three

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
it so I can you know plug at least three

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.270 
it so I can you know plug at least three
different<00:01:21.079> things<00:01:21.200> into<00:01:21.469> there<00:01:21.649> and<00:01:21.859> have

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
different things into there and have

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.760 
different things into there and have
volume<00:01:22.609> control<00:01:22.969> for<00:01:22.999> all<00:01:23.359> three<00:01:23.659> channel<00:01:24.619> one

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
volume control for all three channel one

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.440 
volume control for all three channel one
is<00:01:24.920> really<00:01:25.069> cool<00:01:25.399> too<00:01:25.609> there's<00:01:26.060> a<00:01:26.119> punch

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399 
switch which gives me some more

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:30.099 
switch which gives me some more
frequencies<00:01:28.909> to<00:01:29.090> bring<00:01:29.389> out<00:01:29.509> my<00:01:29.630> snare<00:01:29.959> and
