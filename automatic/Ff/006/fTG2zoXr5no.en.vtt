00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 you gelderse rooms are lovely piece 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.870
 the moral a victory cash this 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.420
 Victory definitely must think last 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.740
 two games are lost then 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.660
 means you must have it 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.910
 to win 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.130
 the 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.430
 then you also get problems if you 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.110
 the third exercise 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.010
 we still had the three points today 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.520
 win along 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.150
 [Music] 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.430
 do everything 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.699
 and I think we 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:32.060
 good sent 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:34.940
 it from backwards 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:39.020
 good communication and april I certainly too 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:41.090
 that we would play and then plus 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.000
 you naturally on all players who what or 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.340
 produces are on could be tactical reasons 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.310
 play and 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.520
 refine selection 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.330
 in the dark by intervening on certain 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.070
 sounds 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.870
 that was your intervention today 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.830
 simons behind the center of those roads 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.410
 communication 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.740
 because of the communication it out 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.630
 close after 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.750
 netherlands do we wanted friend too 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.990
 small pass on earth and that is too 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.880
 cool 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.320
 patience with an important purpose of 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.960
 The man stretched her today 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.550
 finally a whole life gift 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.910
 how to achieve 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.800
 Kralingen does as he always plays 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.310
 has his contribution and I am happy for that 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.670
 him men much more for 10 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.750
 and suddenly know what 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.690
 undertake more things than he does 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.560
 share there very cool hey of course 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.180
 fantastic 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.130
 he is playing there at the same time like this 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.370
 for me nobody can run farmers 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.440
 get and that is not quite the hall 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.440
 and prove the chance on Wednesday at the 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.210
 trailer in and we have for him 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.780
 chosen together with timmy 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.290
 because we I can determine it 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.590
 play people 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.280
 wants a lot of zucchini 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.740
 lost 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.840
 connect from doing so and therefore 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.270
 we opted for eric and for 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.710
 probably populate tonight anyway 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.880
 some more to evaluate it was at 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.100
 time and again just to 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.960
 later have a good contractor 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.330
 certain times you just need her 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.170
 had the options on it 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.150
 sewer 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.830
 much earlier the school had already been in the 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.560
 fourth minute the chance to get a note 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.510
 and we didn't do them then 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.420
 euro problems we are going to see 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.830
 but also in certain 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.020
 people now have easy 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.209
 had a loss of the ball from what it says 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.790
 you have to produce more in the game 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.370
 Anyway that's all youthful 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.630
 noble teeth we play a role but we 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.630
 are satisfied with i3
