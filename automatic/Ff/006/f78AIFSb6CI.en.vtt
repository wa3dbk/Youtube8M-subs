00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
could also go to processes and this

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.789 
could also go to processes and this
tells<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:03.840> what<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.110> have<00:02:04.290> running<00:02:04.619> in<00:02:04.740> the

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
tells you what you have running in the

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.990 
tells you what you have running in the
background<00:02:06.110> and<00:02:07.110> then<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:07.469> could<00:02:07.619> also<00:02:08.000> shut

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
background and then you could also shut

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.020 
background and then you could also shut
those<00:02:09.179> down<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.810> those<00:02:10.140> will<00:02:10.819> some<00:02:11.819> of<00:02:11.910> those

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
those down and those will some of those

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.910 
those down and those will some of those
and<00:02:12.690> they<00:02:12.989> will<00:02:13.260> free<00:02:13.590> up

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
and they will free up

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.979 
and they will free up
memory<00:02:14.920> for<00:02:15.190> you<00:02:15.340> so<00:02:17.190> that's<00:02:18.190> a<00:02:18.400> pretty<00:02:18.700> good

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
memory for you so that's a pretty good

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.020 
memory for you so that's a pretty good
that's<00:02:19.989> pretty<00:02:20.260> good<00:02:20.349> way<00:02:20.560> to<00:02:20.620> freed<00:02:20.950> up<00:02:21.130> so<00:02:21.910> if

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
that's pretty good way to freed up so if

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.320 
that's pretty good way to freed up so if
