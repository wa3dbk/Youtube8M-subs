00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.900
 Hello everyone 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.480
 today we find ourselves for a small 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.460
 Superman Tutorial 6 2 to find out how 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.690
 start his bus so I'm sure 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.040
 some of you are going to laugh in 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.140
 seeing this but it's not a joke 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:29.930
 because some people do not arrive 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.710
 not start from arbus so 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.570
 Besides, I was one of the 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.269
 beginners and still four days so I 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.530
 thanks sir computer 68 for having 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:42.690
 explained brief so to start you 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:50.760
 will need a mini electric circuit in 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:54.809
 pressing here then so next you 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:58.940
 must lock the doors by pressing 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.940
 so here 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:05.460
 and then once you have 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:09.210
 unlock the doors you 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.860
 I am serene to put it your goal 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.710
 without neutral where you press is waiting for you 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.400
 go hide the steering wheel or press here 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:21.380
 to put it in others then you 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.380
 remove the handbrake 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:31.909
 and you press here to start the 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.909
 motor no what I forgot 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.560
 yet I had a ticket 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.630
 anyway 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.120
 ah ah actually my goal is to start 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:55.310
 so that's it 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.310
 there as a crowd of children in the engine 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.640
 then to move on you have just 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.330
 pressed on to activate the speed 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.880
 automatic 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:08.269
 and magically here 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:12.030
 students and move on 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:14.099
 that's if I kill you soon you liked it and you 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.720
 tell me in the comments like that 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.239
 I see continue tutoring for you 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.360
 explain for example that running 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:24.180
 how to see the doors will therefore accept 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.349
 do not forget but put a gem 12 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.610
 subscribers it makes me extremely happy 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.610
