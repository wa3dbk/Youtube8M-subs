hi<00:00:00.810> I'm<00:00:01.260> dr.<00:00:01.589> Linda<00:00:01.709> we're<00:00:02.070> gonna<00:00:02.220> be<00:00:02.399> looking

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
hi I'm dr. Linda we're gonna be looking

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.079 
hi I'm dr. Linda we're gonna be looking
at<00:00:03.000> the<00:00:03.389> kidney<00:00:04.080> today<00:00:04.319> and<00:00:04.740> the<00:00:04.890> nephron<00:00:05.339> for

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
at the kidney today and the nephron for

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.169 
at the kidney today and the nephron for
our<00:00:06.480> Adelphi<00:00:07.049> University<00:00:07.250> students<00:00:08.250> so<00:00:08.940> let's

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
our Adelphi University students so let's

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.810 
our Adelphi University students so let's
start<00:00:09.420> with<00:00:09.830> the<00:00:10.830> kidney<00:00:11.190> we'll<00:00:11.400> look<00:00:11.519> at<00:00:11.700> the

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
start with the kidney we'll look at the

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.509 
start with the kidney we'll look at the
outer<00:00:12.150> portion<00:00:12.780> of<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:12.990> kidney<00:00:13.349> we<00:00:14.099> have<00:00:14.309> the

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
outer portion of the kidney we have the

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.070 
outer portion of the kidney we have the
renal<00:00:15.230> capsule<00:00:17.270> we<00:00:18.270> could<00:00:18.449> see<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.720> renal

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
renal capsule we could see the renal

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.140 
renal capsule we could see the renal
artery<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.740> renal<00:00:20.070> vein<00:00:20.510> if<00:00:21.590> we<00:00:22.590> cut<00:00:23.279> this<00:00:23.670> and

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
artery and renal vein if we cut this and

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.439 
artery and renal vein if we cut this and
we<00:00:24.900> look<00:00:24.930> at<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.680> inside<00:00:27.019> so<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.140> looks<00:00:28.380> like

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 
we look at the inside so it looks like

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.179 
we look at the inside so it looks like
7:52<00:00:30.449> right<00:00:30.779> in<00:00:30.929> here<00:00:31.140> this<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.590> renal

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
7:52 right in here this is the renal

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:39.920 
7:52 right in here this is the renal
capsule<00:00:35.899> the<00:00:36.899> next<00:00:37.559> region<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:38.840> looks<00:00:39.840> like

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
capsule the next region in looks like

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.490 
capsule the next region in looks like
here<00:00:40.649> at<00:00:40.739> 7:53<00:00:41.629> this<00:00:42.629> would<00:00:42.899> be<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.170> renal

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
here at 7:53 this would be the renal

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.549 
here at 7:53 this would be the renal
cortex<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.460> cortex<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.300> outer<00:00:45.780> portion

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
cortex the cortex is the outer portion

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.130 
cortex the cortex is the outer portion
and<00:00:48.320> then<00:00:49.320> as<00:00:49.559> we<00:00:49.860> move<00:00:49.890> in<00:00:50.340> here<00:00:51.270> this<00:00:51.750> would

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
and then as we move in here this would

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.639 
and then as we move in here this would
be<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.770> medulla<00:00:53.780> which<00:00:54.780> we<00:00:55.020> also<00:00:55.199> have<00:00:55.530> the

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
be the medulla which we also have the

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.830 
be the medulla which we also have the
pyramids<00:00:58.129> the<00:00:59.129> each<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.640> these<00:00:59.969> pyramids<00:01:00.660> will

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
pyramids the each of these pyramids will

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.119 
pyramids the each of these pyramids will
drain<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.410> filtrate<00:01:02.010> into<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.510> minor

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
drain the filtrate into the minor

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.890 
drain the filtrate into the minor
calyce's<00:01:05.129> which<00:01:05.610> we<00:01:05.790> see<00:01:06.000> here<00:01:06.030> minor

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
calyce's which we see here minor

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.390 
calyce's which we see here minor
calyce's<00:01:08.000> then<00:01:09.000> we<00:01:09.180> have<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.659> major<00:01:10.760> calyx<00:01:11.760> and

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
calyce's then we have a major calyx and

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.539 
calyce's then we have a major calyx and
the<00:01:14.400> major<00:01:14.670> calyx<00:01:15.450> dumps<00:01:16.170> into<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.770> renal

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
the major calyx dumps into the renal

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.380 
the major calyx dumps into the renal
pelvis<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:19.920> renal<00:01:20.130> pelvis<00:01:20.460> will<00:01:21.000> drain

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
pelvis and the renal pelvis will drain

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.380 
pelvis and the renal pelvis will drain
that<00:01:21.630> filtrate<00:01:22.320> which<00:01:22.350> becomes<00:01:23.009> urine<00:01:23.400> into

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
that filtrate which becomes urine into

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.080 
that filtrate which becomes urine into
the<00:01:24.570> ureter<00:01:25.520> remember<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.729> have<00:01:27.060> two<00:01:27.509> kidneys

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
the ureter remember you have two kidneys

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.380 
the ureter remember you have two kidneys
the<00:01:30.090> word<00:01:30.360> ureter<00:01:31.020> has<00:01:31.320> two<00:01:31.560> E's<00:01:32.150> so<00:01:33.150> we<00:01:33.270> have

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
the word ureter has two E's so we have

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.140 
the word ureter has two E's so we have
two-year<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.869> tours<00:01:34.140> but<00:01:34.470> there's<00:01:34.650> only<00:01:34.710> one

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
two-year a tours but there's only one

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.530 
two-year a tours but there's only one
urethra<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:37.110> remember<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.979> function<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.880> the

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
urethra and remember the function of the

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.170 
urethra and remember the function of the
the<00:01:40.350> kidney<00:01:40.860> within<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.280> kidney<00:01:41.670> we<00:01:41.970> have<00:01:42.150> a

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
the kidney within the kidney we have a

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.899 
the kidney within the kidney we have a
nephron<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.829> main<00:01:44.040> function<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.790> that

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
nephron and the main function of that

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.649 
nephron and the main function of that
nephron<00:01:45.479> is<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:46.020> filter<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.649> blood<00:01:47.390> not<00:01:48.390> only

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
nephron is to filter the blood not only

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.679 
nephron is to filter the blood not only
filter<00:01:49.110> but<00:01:49.290> reabsorb<00:01:50.100> certain<00:01:51.090> things<00:01:51.360> back

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
filter but reabsorb certain things back

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.410 
filter but reabsorb certain things back
into<00:01:52.049> circulation<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:53.939> which<00:01:54.240> it

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
into circulation and that which it

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.100 
into circulation and that which it
doesn't<00:01:54.659> want<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.710> will<00:01:56.119> excrete<00:01:57.119> or<00:01:57.540> secrete

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
doesn't want it will excrete or secrete

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.580 
doesn't want it will excrete or secrete
from<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.530> body<00:01:58.850> okay<00:01:59.990> all<00:02:00.990> right<00:02:01.140> so<00:02:01.380> now

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
from the body okay all right so now

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.170 
from the body okay all right so now
let's<00:02:01.619> take<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.280> look<00:02:02.729> at<00:02:03.500> the<00:02:04.670> inner<00:02:05.670> portion

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
let's take a look at the inner portion

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.389 
let's take a look at the inner portion
of<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:07.469> kidney

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
of the kidney

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.570 
of the kidney
if<00:02:08.729> we<00:02:08.970> start<00:02:09.239> on<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.420> outside<00:02:09.890> here<00:02:10.890> this<00:02:11.400> is

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
if we start on the outside here this is

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.850 
if we start on the outside here this is
the<00:02:11.670> renal<00:02:11.970> cortex<00:02:13.430> you<00:02:14.430> know<00:02:14.519> think<00:02:14.790> back<00:02:14.970> to

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
the renal cortex you know think back to

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.660 
the renal cortex you know think back to
endocrinology<00:02:16.860> when<00:02:16.980> we<00:02:17.040> did<00:02:17.159> the<00:02:17.250> adrenal

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
endocrinology when we did the adrenal

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.660 
endocrinology when we did the adrenal
gland<00:02:18.000> there<00:02:18.269> was<00:02:18.420> a<00:02:18.450> cortex<00:02:19.379> and<00:02:19.680> a<00:02:20.190> medulla

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
gland there was a cortex and a medulla

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.509 
gland there was a cortex and a medulla
in<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.299> kidney<00:02:21.690> we<00:02:22.170> have<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.319> cortex<00:02:23.010> all

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
in the kidney we have a cortex all

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.289 
in the kidney we have a cortex all
around<00:02:24.030> here<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:24.690> then<00:02:25.620> we<00:02:25.799> have<00:02:26.069> the<00:02:26.790> medulla

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
around here and then we have the medulla

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:32.059 
around here and then we have the medulla
which<00:02:27.959> is<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.680> pink<00:02:28.950> portion<00:02:29.579> here<00:02:30.799> now<00:02:31.799> each

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
which is the pink portion here now each

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.789 
which is the pink portion here now each
of<00:02:32.099> these<00:02:32.519> portions<00:02:33.290> also<00:02:34.290> makes<00:02:34.530> up<00:02:34.680> a

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
of these portions also makes up a

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:39.020 
of these portions also makes up a
pyramid<00:02:36.290> here's<00:02:37.290> a<00:02:37.379> pyramid<00:02:37.980> here's<00:02:38.909> a

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
component of the nephron if we look at

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.440 
component of the nephron if we look at
the<00:02:58.650> different<00:02:59.069> components<00:02:59.819> of<00:02:59.909> the<00:03:00.030> nephron

the different components of the nephron
we're<00:03:00.780> going<00:03:00.930> to<00:03:00.989> go<00:03:01.140> to<00:03:01.200> these<00:03:01.560> two<00:03:01.980> parts<00:03:02.700> of

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
we're going to go to these two parts of

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.550 
we're going to go to these two parts of
the<00:03:02.909> plaque<00:03:03.180> now<00:03:04.340> we<00:03:05.340> have<00:03:05.489> this<00:03:05.730> portion

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
the plaque now we have this portion

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.569 
the plaque now we have this portion
which<00:03:07.560> is<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:08.459> glomerulus<00:03:09.359> or<00:03:10.579> renal

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
which is the glomerulus or renal

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.300 
which is the glomerulus or renal
corpuscle<00:03:12.419> if<00:03:12.720> we<00:03:13.500> take<00:03:13.680> this<00:03:13.889> renal

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
corpuscle if we take this renal

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.479 
corpuscle if we take this renal
corpuscle<00:03:15.060> and<00:03:15.329> we<00:03:15.989> open<00:03:16.530> it<00:03:16.650> up<00:03:16.799> it's<00:03:17.220> going

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
corpuscle and we open it up it's going

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.220 
corpuscle and we open it up it's going
to<00:03:17.639> take<00:03:17.849> us<00:03:18.060> and<00:03:18.269> we<00:03:18.389> blow<00:03:18.660> it<00:03:18.690> up<00:03:18.959> we're

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
to take us and we blow it up we're

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.670 
to take us and we blow it up we're
looking<00:03:19.590> at<00:03:19.709> this<00:03:20.269> so<00:03:21.269> within<00:03:21.599> this<00:03:22.019> renal

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
looking at this so within this renal

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.259 
looking at this so within this renal
corpuscle<00:03:23.900> we<00:03:24.900> have<00:03:25.169> what's<00:03:25.950> called<00:03:26.269> Bowman's

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
corpuscle we have what's called Bowman's

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.800 
corpuscle we have what's called Bowman's
capsule<00:03:28.669> which<00:03:29.669> would<00:03:29.849> be<00:03:29.970> this<00:03:30.209> structure

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
capsule which would be this structure

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.990 
capsule which would be this structure
and<00:03:31.049> then<00:03:31.739> we<00:03:31.950> have<00:03:32.160> something<00:03:32.430> sitting

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
and then we have something sitting

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.839 
and then we have something sitting
inside<00:03:33.120> it<00:03:33.419> like<00:03:33.780> my<00:03:34.019> fist<00:03:34.349> in<00:03:34.530> my<00:03:34.560> hand<00:03:35.010> and<00:03:35.370> my

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
inside it like my fist in my hand and my

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:41.080 
inside it like my fist in my hand and my
fist<00:03:36.150> would<00:03:36.389> be<00:03:36.569> the<00:03:36.810> glomerulus<00:03:39.319> so<00:03:40.319> this

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
fist would be the glomerulus so this

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.119 
fist would be the glomerulus so this
group<00:03:42.090> of<00:03:42.269> capillaries<00:03:43.049> inside<00:03:43.560> is<00:03:43.980> the

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:44.129 
group of capillaries inside is the

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:46.490 
group of capillaries inside is the
glomerulus<00:03:44.819> and<00:03:45.090> it's<00:03:45.540> contained<00:03:46.049> within

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
glomerulus and it's contained within

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.650 
glomerulus and it's contained within
this<00:03:46.919> Bowman's<00:03:47.639> capsule<00:03:49.609> so<00:03:50.609> blood<00:03:51.060> remember

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
this Bowman's capsule so blood remember

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.599 
this Bowman's capsule so blood remember
one<00:03:51.959> of<00:03:51.989> the<00:03:52.109> functions<00:03:52.650> of<00:03:52.859> the<00:03:53.040> nephron<00:03:53.459> is

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
one of the functions of the nephron is

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:56.300 
one of the functions of the nephron is
to<00:03:53.760> filter<00:03:54.000> out<00:03:54.299> blood<00:03:54.599> so<00:03:54.840> blood<00:03:55.199> is<00:03:55.739> coming

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
to filter out blood so blood is coming

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.909 
to filter out blood so blood is coming
in<00:03:56.840> via<00:03:57.840> this<00:03:58.379> a<00:03:58.560> ferrant<00:03:59.900> vessel<00:04:00.900> and<00:04:01.169> this

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:01.919 
in via this a ferrant vessel and this

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:03.559 
in via this a ferrant vessel and this
ain't<00:04:02.190> fair<00:04:02.400> an<00:04:02.519> arteriole<00:04:03.120> blings

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
ain't fair an arteriole blings

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:06.740 
ain't fair an arteriole blings
brings<00:04:04.109> blood<00:04:04.639> into<00:04:05.639> the<00:04:05.790> glomerulus<00:04:05.970> and

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
brings blood into the glomerulus and

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.869 
brings blood into the glomerulus and
this<00:04:07.199> is<00:04:07.319> where<00:04:07.530> filtration<00:04:08.340> is<00:04:08.459> going<00:04:08.730> to

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
this is where filtration is going to

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:11.479 
this is where filtration is going to
take<00:04:09.060> place<00:04:09.329> and<00:04:09.750> we<00:04:10.290> can<00:04:10.530> see<00:04:10.829> that<00:04:10.859> we've<00:04:11.310> got

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
take place and we can see that we've got

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.879 
take place and we can see that we've got
Poteau<00:04:11.910> sites<00:04:12.389> that<00:04:12.870> surround<00:04:13.500> this

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889 
Poteau sites that surround this

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:16.810 
Poteau sites that surround this
capillary<00:04:14.340> system<00:04:15.090> and<00:04:15.269> these<00:04:15.720> proto<00:04:16.079> sites

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
capillary system and these proto sites

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.229 
capillary system and these proto sites
have<00:04:17.820> the

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
have the

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.409 
have the
filtration<00:04:18.799> slits<00:04:19.799> between<00:04:20.459> them<00:04:20.729> that<00:04:21.269> will

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
filtration slits between them that will

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.770 
filtration slits between them that will
allow<00:04:21.720> certain<00:04:22.349> things<00:04:22.620> to<00:04:22.889> fit<00:04:23.099> through<00:04:23.780> to

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
allow certain things to fit through to

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.930 
allow certain things to fit through to
pull<00:04:25.020> out<00:04:25.199> into<00:04:25.710> what's<00:04:25.919> called<00:04:26.009> filtrate

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
pull out into what's called filtrate

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.150 
pull out into what's called filtrate
certain<00:04:27.630> things<00:04:27.870> should<00:04:28.080> not<00:04:28.410> fit<00:04:28.800> through

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
certain things should not fit through

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.659 
certain things should not fit through
there

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
there

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.089 
there
so<00:04:30.030> we<00:04:30.210> don't<00:04:30.330> want<00:04:30.599> to<00:04:30.690> find<00:04:30.930> proteins<00:04:31.620> red

00:04:32.089 --> 00:04:32.099 
so we don't want to find proteins red

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:34.460 
so we don't want to find proteins red
blood<00:04:32.430> cells<00:04:32.819> white<00:04:33.240> blood<00:04:33.270> cells<00:04:33.630> in<00:04:34.319> our

filtrate that should stay within
circulation<00:04:37.440> if<00:04:38.069> they<00:04:38.340> do<00:04:38.400> show<00:04:38.580> up<00:04:38.880> then

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
circulation if they do show up then

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.510 
circulation if they do show up then
there's<00:04:39.539> some<00:04:39.930> sort<00:04:40.319> of<00:04:40.470> abnormality<00:04:41.280> going

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
there's some sort of abnormality going

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.820 
there's some sort of abnormality going
on<00:04:41.669> or<00:04:41.819> some<00:04:42.030> malfunction<00:04:42.720> so<00:04:43.530> these<00:04:43.650> are

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
on or some malfunction so these are

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.330 
on or some malfunction so these are
podocytes<00:04:45.020> the<00:04:46.020> a<00:04:46.050> ferret<00:04:46.560> vessel<00:04:46.979> is<00:04:47.069> pretty

podocytes the a ferret vessel is pretty

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.629 
podocytes the a ferret vessel is pretty

large the efferent vessel that exited is

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:53.930 
large the efferent vessel that exited is
a<00:04:50.669> lot<00:04:50.970> thinner<00:04:52.099> so<00:04:53.099> here's<00:04:53.370> our<00:04:53.520> Bowman's

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
a lot thinner so here's our Bowman's

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.930 
a lot thinner so here's our Bowman's
capsule<00:04:54.500> when<00:04:55.500> that<00:04:55.650> filtrate<00:04:56.340> is<00:04:56.520> pulled<00:04:56.789> out

capsule when that filtrate is pulled out

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.080 
capsule when that filtrate is pulled out
it<00:04:57.300> will<00:04:57.509> now<00:04:57.720> enter<00:04:58.319> the<00:04:58.560> first<00:04:59.069> portion<00:04:59.580> of

so<00:05:05.490> now<00:05:05.610> if<00:05:05.699> we<00:05:05.789> go<00:05:05.880> from<00:05:06.330> here<00:05:06.810> and<00:05:07.380> we<00:05:07.560> go<00:05:07.740> back

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039 
so now if we go from here and we go back

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:12.050 
so now if we go from here and we go back
to<00:05:08.400> this<00:05:08.669> structure<00:05:09.330> there's<00:05:10.259> our<00:05:11.060> renal

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
to this structure there's our renal

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.409 
to this structure there's our renal
corpuscle<00:05:12.750> and<00:05:13.550> inside<00:05:14.550> is<00:05:14.759> the<00:05:14.849> glomerulus

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
corpuscle and inside is the glomerulus

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:18.020 
corpuscle and inside is the glomerulus
and<00:05:15.599> Bowman's<00:05:15.990> capsule<00:05:16.169> that<00:05:16.919> first<00:05:17.370> part<00:05:17.759> is

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
and Bowman's capsule that first part is

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.499 
and Bowman's capsule that first part is
called<00:05:18.240> the<00:05:18.479> proximal<00:05:18.900> convoluted<00:05:19.590> tubule<00:05:20.509> so

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:21.509 
called the proximal convoluted tubule so

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:23.300 
called the proximal convoluted tubule so
here's<00:05:21.780> the<00:05:21.930> proximal<00:05:22.620> convoluted<00:05:22.650> tubule

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
here's the proximal convoluted tubule

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.209 
here's the proximal convoluted tubule
now<00:05:23.909> this<00:05:24.389> is<00:05:24.719> all<00:05:25.050> contained<00:05:25.740> within<00:05:25.979> this

00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:26.219 
now this is all contained within this

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:30.379 
now this is all contained within this
portion<00:05:26.849> here<00:05:27.270> the<00:05:27.630> cortex<00:05:29.060> so<00:05:30.060> we've<00:05:30.240> got<00:05:30.360> a

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:30.389 
portion here the cortex so we've got a

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:34.850 
portion here the cortex so we've got a
proximal<00:05:31.229> convoluted<00:05:31.440> tubule<00:05:33.380> then<00:05:34.380> we<00:05:34.530> start

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 
proximal convoluted tubule then we start

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.820 
proximal convoluted tubule then we start
to<00:05:35.070> descend<00:05:35.669> down<00:05:35.880> into<00:05:36.449> the<00:05:36.870> descending<00:05:37.800> limb

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
to descend down into the descending limb

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.290 
to descend down into the descending limb
of<00:05:38.699> what's<00:05:39.539> called<00:05:39.840> the<00:05:39.960> loop<00:05:40.380> of<00:05:40.620> Henle<00:05:41.580> so

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
of what's called the loop of Henle so

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.810 
of what's called the loop of Henle so
this<00:05:42.509> loop<00:05:42.810> is<00:05:43.139> the<00:05:43.500> loop<00:05:43.830> of<00:05:44.039> Henle<00:05:44.400> and<00:05:44.610> that

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
this loop is the loop of Henle and that

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.899 
this loop is the loop of Henle and that
takes<00:05:45.120> place<00:05:45.479> right<00:05:45.810> here<00:05:46.440> that<00:05:46.889> loop<00:05:47.340> is<00:05:47.639> now

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:47.909 
takes place right here that loop is now

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:52.490 
takes place right here that loop is now
in<00:05:48.240> the<00:05:48.389> pyramids<00:05:48.900> or<00:05:48.990> in<00:05:49.139> the<00:05:49.259> medulla<00:05:51.500> so

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 
in the pyramids or in the medulla so

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.969 
in the pyramids or in the medulla so
here's<00:05:52.830> our<00:05:53.039> descending<00:05:53.880> limb<00:05:54.620> this<00:05:55.620> is<00:05:55.830> our

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979 
here's our descending limb this is our

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:58.279 
here's our descending limb this is our
ascending<00:05:56.789> limb<00:05:56.969> of<00:05:57.030> what's<00:05:57.719> called<00:05:57.990> a<00:05:58.110> loop

00:05:58.279 --> 00:05:58.289 
ascending limb of what's called a loop

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:01.219 
ascending limb of what's called a loop
of<00:05:58.469> Henle<00:05:58.800> this<00:05:59.250> is<00:05:59.460> where<00:05:59.759> the<00:06:00.229> counter

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:01.229 
of Henle this is where the counter

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:03.559 
of Henle this is where the counter
current<00:06:01.620> mechanism<00:06:02.219> takes<00:06:02.460> place<00:06:02.789> of<00:06:03.120> salt

00:06:03.559 --> 00:06:03.569 
current mechanism takes place of salt

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:06.680 
current mechanism takes place of salt
and<00:06:03.810> water<00:06:04.020> exchange<00:06:04.669> the<00:06:05.669> medulla<00:06:06.210> is<00:06:06.240> quite

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
and water exchange the medulla is quite

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:11.959 
and water exchange the medulla is quite
salty<00:06:08.569> we<00:06:09.569> a<00:06:09.810> send<00:06:10.229> up<00:06:10.580> into<00:06:11.580> what's<00:06:11.819> called

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:11.969 
salty we a send up into what's called

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:15.230 
salty we a send up into what's called
the<00:06:12.569> distal<00:06:13.289> convoluted<00:06:14.069> tubule<00:06:15.060> it's

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
the distal convoluted tubule it's

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.899 
the distal convoluted tubule it's
convoluted<00:06:16.250> so<00:06:17.250> that's<00:06:17.400> why<00:06:17.490> we<00:06:17.580> call<00:06:17.759> the

00:06:17.899 --> 00:06:17.909 
convoluted so that's why we call the

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:19.870 
convoluted so that's why we call the
distal<00:06:18.330> convoluted<00:06:18.500> tubules

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.880 
distal convoluted tubules

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.529 
distal convoluted tubules
now<00:06:20.880> that<00:06:21.210> filtrate<00:06:21.990> is<00:06:22.800> drained<00:06:23.370> into<00:06:23.669> what's

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:24.539 
now that filtrate is drained into what's

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:28.189 
now that filtrate is drained into what's
called<00:06:24.840> the<00:06:24.960> collecting<00:06:25.580> tubules<00:06:27.199> the

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:28.199 
called the collecting tubules the

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:29.970 
called the collecting tubules the
collecting<00:06:28.740> tubules<00:06:29.219> drained

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:29.980 
collecting tubules drained

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:36.150 
collecting tubules drained
down<00:06:30.100> down<00:06:30.640> down<00:06:31.260> into<00:06:32.260> the<00:06:33.010> papal<00:06:33.580> ax<00:06:35.010> so<00:06:36.010> if

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.160 
down down down into the papal ax so if

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:41.000 
down down down into the papal ax so if
we<00:06:36.340> follow<00:06:36.610> this<00:06:37.950> here's<00:06:38.950> the<00:06:39.160> loop<00:06:39.280> of<00:06:39.520> Henle

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.010 
we follow this here's the loop of Henle

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:46.350 
we follow this here's the loop of Henle
here's<00:06:42.010> the<00:06:42.280> collecting<00:06:42.970> tube<00:06:43.420> you'll<00:06:44.040> and<00:06:45.360> we

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:46.360 
here's the collecting tube you'll and we

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.640 
here's the collecting tube you'll and we
follow<00:06:46.630> that<00:06:46.960> down<00:06:47.230> into<00:06:47.620> the<00:06:47.710> papal<00:06:48.190> ax<00:06:48.310> into

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:49.650 
follow that down into the papal ax into

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:53.970 
follow that down into the papal ax into
what's<00:06:50.650> called<00:06:51.010> a<00:06:51.100> minor<00:06:51.750> calyx<00:06:52.750> so<00:06:53.710> we<00:06:53.860> have<00:06:53.950> a

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:53.980 
what's called a minor calyx so we have a

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:57.060 
what's called a minor calyx so we have a
minor<00:06:54.310> calyx<00:06:55.000> here<00:06:55.630> there's<00:06:56.320> another<00:06:56.710> minor

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:57.070 
minor calyx here there's another minor

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:00.720 
minor calyx here there's another minor
calyx<00:06:57.730> here<00:06:58.360> another<00:06:59.110> minor<00:06:59.470> calyx<00:07:00.100> here<00:07:00.580> and

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:00.730 
calyx here another minor calyx here and

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:02.760 
calyx here another minor calyx here and
all<00:07:01.150> these<00:07:01.390> minor<00:07:01.720> calyce's

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:02.770 
all these minor calyce's

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:07.230 
all these minor calyce's
will<00:07:03.580> drain<00:07:04.030> the<00:07:04.270> filtrate<00:07:04.960> into<00:07:05.950> a<00:07:06.240> larger

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:07.240 
will drain the filtrate into a larger

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.310 
will drain the filtrate into a larger
calyx<00:07:08.050> called<00:07:08.320> the<00:07:08.410> major<00:07:08.970> calyx<00:07:09.970> the<00:07:10.960> major

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:11.320 
calyx called the major calyx the major

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.970 
calyx called the major calyx the major
calyx<00:07:12.130> will<00:07:12.670> then<00:07:12.970> drain<00:07:13.540> that<00:07:13.720> filtrate<00:07:14.380> into

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:14.980 
calyx will then drain that filtrate into

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:19.560 
calyx will then drain that filtrate into
the<00:07:15.130> renal<00:07:15.430> pelvis<00:07:18.180> eventually<00:07:19.180> into<00:07:19.540> the

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:19.570 
the renal pelvis eventually into the

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:25.200 
the renal pelvis eventually into the
ureter<00:07:21.120> okay<00:07:23.010> and<00:07:24.010> I<00:07:24.100> think<00:07:24.160> that<00:07:24.520> covers<00:07:24.790> all

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:25.210 
ureter okay and I think that covers all

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:27.720 
ureter okay and I think that covers all
of<00:07:25.240> the<00:07:25.570> structures<00:07:26.470> one<00:07:26.950> other<00:07:27.130> structure

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:27.730 
of the structures one other structure

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:32.370 
of the structures one other structure
here<00:07:28.260> this<00:07:29.260> is<00:07:29.500> part<00:07:29.800> of<00:07:29.920> the<00:07:31.380> distal

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:32.380 
here this is part of the distal

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.290 
here this is part of the distal
convoluted<00:07:32.650> tubules<00:07:33.610> is<00:07:34.000> where<00:07:34.150> the

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:34.300 
convoluted tubules is where the

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:38.640 
convoluted tubules is where the
glomerular<00:07:36.060> apparatuses<00:07:37.060> and<00:07:37.450> this<00:07:38.440> has

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:38.650 
glomerular apparatuses and this has

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:41.940 
glomerular apparatuses and this has
chemo<00:07:39.370> receptors<00:07:39.520> that<00:07:40.210> help<00:07:40.450> determine<00:07:41.050> what

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:41.950 
chemo receptors that help determine what

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:48.150 
chemo receptors that help determine what

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:48.160 
your blood pressure is like okay stay

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.590 
your blood pressure is like okay stay
