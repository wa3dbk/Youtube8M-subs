00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
CPX are but most of this is going to

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.900 
CPX are but most of this is going to
apply<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.750> all<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.410> helmets<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:59.460> we<00:00:59.550> all<00:00:59.699> know

can button comfortably without pulling
it<00:03:43.740> one<00:03:43.950> way<00:03:44.100> or<00:03:44.130> the<00:03:44.310> other<00:03:44.340> or<00:03:44.730> making<00:03:45.360> it

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
it one way or the other or making it

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.850 
it one way or the other or making it
tighter<00:03:45.720> and<00:03:45.930> essentially<00:03:46.410> this<00:03:46.500> is<00:03:46.560> going<00:03:46.709> to

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
tighter and essentially this is going to

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.890 
tighter and essentially this is going to
give<00:03:47.070> you<00:03:47.250> what<00:03:47.490> you<00:03:47.520> want<00:03:47.850> so<00:03:48.090> the<00:03:48.630> main

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
give you what you want so the main

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.690 
give you what you want so the main
theory<00:03:49.530> behind<00:03:49.709> making<00:03:50.250> your<00:03:50.370> helmet<00:03:50.610> have

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
theory behind making your helmet have

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.870 
theory behind making your helmet have
good<00:03:50.880> tilt<00:03:51.180> is<00:03:51.330> going<00:03:51.900> to<00:03:51.959> be<00:03:52.430> tighter<00:03:53.430> on<00:03:53.820> the

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
good tilt is going to be tighter on the

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.230 
good tilt is going to be tighter on the
top<00:03:54.510> two<00:03:54.750> straps<00:03:55.140> and<00:03:55.470> looser<00:03:56.340> on<00:03:56.580> the<00:03:56.850> bottom

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
top two straps and looser on the bottom

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.090 
top two straps and looser on the bottom
-<00:03:57.450> you'll<00:03:57.630> so<00:03:57.870> you'll<00:03:58.020> see<00:03:58.230> people<00:03:58.590> a<00:03:58.830> lot<00:03:58.980> of

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
- you'll so you'll see people a lot of

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.920 
- you'll so you'll see people a lot of
times<00:03:59.340> that<00:03:59.970> aren't<00:04:00.240> wearing<00:04:00.510> their<00:04:00.660> straps

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
times that aren't wearing their straps

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.199 
times that aren't wearing their straps
at<00:04:01.080> all<00:04:01.230> that's<00:04:01.590> because<00:04:01.830> the<00:04:02.190> top<00:04:02.430> two<00:04:02.670> are

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
at all that's because the top two are

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.120 
at all that's because the top two are
pulled<00:04:03.570> nice<00:04:03.750> and<00:04:03.959> tight<00:04:04.140> and<00:04:04.350> it's<00:04:04.950> going<00:04:05.040> to

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
pulled nice and tight and it's going to

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.180 
pulled nice and tight and it's going to
keep<00:04:05.280> it<00:04:05.430> tight<00:04:05.610> up<00:04:05.730> on<00:04:05.820> your<00:04:05.940> chin<00:04:06.209> and<00:04:06.420> so<00:04:07.230> the

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
keep it tight up on your chin and so the

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.460 
keep it tight up on your chin and so the
other<00:04:08.690> fine-tuning<00:04:09.690> adjustment<00:04:10.140> you<00:04:10.200> can<00:04:10.320> do

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
other fine-tuning adjustment you can do

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.070 
other fine-tuning adjustment you can do
is<00:04:10.709> to<00:04:11.100> tighten<00:04:12.060> or<00:04:12.680> loosen

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
is to tighten or loosen

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.050 
is to tighten or loosen
