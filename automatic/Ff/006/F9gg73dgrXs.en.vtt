you

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.850 

look<00:01:40.940> for<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:41.360> common<00:01:41.600> rail<00:01:41.960> pipe

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
look for the common rail pipe

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.190 
look for the common rail pipe
you<00:01:44.550> can<00:01:44.820> identify<00:01:44.940> it<00:01:45.600> by<00:01:45.870> the<00:01:45.930> outgoing

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
you can identify it by the outgoing

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.880 
you can identify it by the outgoing
diesel<00:01:47.160> lines<00:01:47.690> at<00:01:48.690> the<00:01:49.170> end<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.620> pipe

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
diesel lines at the end of the pipe

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.330 
diesel lines at the end of the pipe
you'll<00:01:50.640> find<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.240> 3<00:01:51.510> pin<00:01:51.780> Sansa<00:01:52.380> plug<00:01:52.590> the

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
you'll find a 3 pin Sansa plug the

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.520 
you'll find a 3 pin Sansa plug the
position<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.240> common<00:01:54.570> rail<00:01:54.810> pipe<00:01:55.200> can

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
position of the common rail pipe can

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:05.580 
position of the common rail pipe can
vary<00:01:55.890> from<00:01:56.310> vehicle<00:01:56.610> type<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.450> vehicle<00:01:57.930> type

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.919 

you

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.649 

for<00:02:11.560> example<00:02:12.129> in<00:02:12.340> this<00:02:12.519> Opel<00:02:13.000> here<00:02:13.299> it's

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:13.659 
for example in this Opel here it's

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:16.020 
for example in this Opel here it's
really<00:02:14.079> hidden<00:02:14.349> however<00:02:15.159> when<00:02:15.670> you<00:02:15.819> have<00:02:16.000> a

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
really hidden however when you have a

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.449 
really hidden however when you have a
closer<00:02:16.360> look<00:02:16.569> the<00:02:17.200> silvery<00:02:17.620> pipe<00:02:17.950> with<00:02:18.340> the

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
closer look the silvery pipe with the

closer look the silvery pipe with the
diesel<00:02:18.849> lines<00:02:19.120> can<00:02:19.510> easily<00:02:20.079> be<00:02:20.260> identified<00:02:20.370> in

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
diesel lines can easily be identified in

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.850 
diesel lines can easily be identified in
most<00:02:21.849> of<00:02:22.090> the<00:02:22.209> cases<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:23.079> pluck<00:02:23.319> is<00:02:23.560> at<00:02:23.739> the

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
most of the cases the pluck is at the

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.970 
most of the cases the pluck is at the
end<00:02:24.040> of<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.579> pipe

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
end of the pipe

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.089 
end of the pipe
first<00:02:26.849> unlock<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.659> three<00:02:27.900> pin<00:02:28.200> plug<00:02:28.500> as<00:02:28.769> shown

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
first unlock the three pin plug as shown

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.180 
first unlock the three pin plug as shown
and<00:02:29.400> disconnected<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:31.080> design<00:02:31.530> of<00:02:31.769> the<00:02:31.890> plugs

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
and disconnected the design of the plugs

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.800 
and disconnected the design of the plugs
can<00:02:32.489> vary

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.809 

now<00:02:37.930> insert<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:38.800> plug<00:02:39.069> of<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.340> wire<00:02:39.670> harness

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
now insert the plug of the wire harness

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.620 
now insert the plug of the wire harness
into<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.780> sensor<00:02:41.380> you<00:02:41.760> should<00:02:42.760> hear<00:02:43.090> a<00:02:43.209> clear

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
into the sensor you should hear a clear

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.710 
into the sensor you should hear a clear
click<00:02:44.080> sound

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
click sound

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.750
