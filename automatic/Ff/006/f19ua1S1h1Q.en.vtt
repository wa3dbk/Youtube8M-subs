00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
speeds off and is chased by two of the

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.640 
speeds off and is chased by two of the
the<00:02:49.710> tremor<00:02:49.950> monsters<00:02:50.430> I<00:02:50.580> guess<00:02:51.380> yep<00:02:52.440> and

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
the tremor monsters I guess yep and

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.440 
the tremor monsters I guess yep and
another<00:02:53.040> good<00:02:53.220> trick<00:02:53.340> too<00:02:53.580> is<00:02:53.790> if<00:02:53.940> you<00:02:54.060> if<00:02:54.330> you

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
another good trick too is if you if you

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.300 
another good trick too is if you if you
have<00:02:54.570> a<00:02:54.600> flag<00:02:54.930> or<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.170> odd<00:02:55.290> bomb<00:02:55.500> and<00:02:56.160> you

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
have a flag or the odd bomb and you

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.640 
have a flag or the odd bomb and you
actually<00:02:56.790> get<00:02:57.030> that<00:02:57.330> and<00:02:57.660> if<00:02:57.960> you're<00:02:58.140> landed

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
actually get that and if you're landed

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.260 
actually get that and if you're landed
and<00:02:58.860> if<00:02:58.950> you<00:02:59.070> were<00:02:59.190> landing<00:02:59.790> down<00:02:59.940> on<00:03:00.150> the

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
and if you were landing down on the

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.780 
and if you were landing down on the
ghost<00:03:00.510> trying<00:03:01.380> to<00:03:01.470> like<00:03:01.620> t-bag<00:03:02.070> and<00:03:02.280> crouch<00:03:02.520> it

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
ghost trying to like t-bag and crouch it

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.000 
ghost trying to like t-bag and crouch it
helps<00:03:03.090> with<00:03:03.270> the<00:03:03.450> damage<00:03:03.930> resistance<00:03:04.560> so<00:03:04.800> you

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
helps with the damage resistance so you

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.980 
helps with the damage resistance so you
know<00:03:05.340> you're<00:03:05.580> less<00:03:05.820> likely<00:03:06.180> to<00:03:06.210> die<00:03:06.420> if<00:03:06.630> on<00:03:06.840> the

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
know you're less likely to die if on the

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.690 
know you're less likely to die if on the
way<00:03:07.080> down<00:03:07.290> you<00:03:07.320> you<00:03:07.890> t-bag<00:03:08.070> and<00:03:08.370> crap<00:03:08.490> so

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700
