just<00:02:09.800> because<00:02:09.979> I<00:02:10.070> felt<00:02:10.250> like<00:02:10.369> it<00:02:11.050> and<00:02:12.050> that's

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
just because I felt like it and that's

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.300 
just because I felt like it and that's
the<00:02:12.320> nice<00:02:12.470> thing<00:02:12.500> about<00:02:12.800> building<00:02:13.040> stuff

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
the nice thing about building stuff

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.710 
the nice thing about building stuff
yourself<00:02:13.760> you<00:02:13.880> can<00:02:14.060> do<00:02:14.180> it<00:02:14.270> because<00:02:14.330> you<00:02:14.540> feel

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
yourself you can do it because you feel

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.560 
yourself you can do it because you feel
like<00:02:14.930> it<00:02:15.110> but<00:02:15.730> uh<00:02:16.730> you<00:02:17.150> know<00:02:17.570> it's<00:02:17.990> uh<00:02:19.330> well<00:02:20.330> my

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
like it but uh you know it's uh well my

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
like it but uh you know it's uh well my
floor<00:02:20.810> is<00:02:20.960> pretty<00:02:21.080> uneven<00:02:21.620> in<00:02:21.710> here<00:02:21.950> but<00:02:23.470> if<00:02:24.470> I

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
floor is pretty uneven in here but if I

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.760 
floor is pretty uneven in here but if I
get<00:02:24.650> it<00:02:24.890> on<00:02:25.010> a<00:02:25.040> level<00:02:25.310> spot<00:02:26.170> it's<00:02:27.170> pretty<00:02:27.500> solid

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.080 

you<00:02:30.770> could<00:02:30.890> probably<00:02:31.070> do<00:02:31.310> a<00:02:31.340> naked<00:02:31.700> dance<00:02:31.880> on

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
you could probably do a naked dance on

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.330 
you could probably do a naked dance on
it<00:02:32.210> if<00:02:32.330> you<00:02:32.450> wanted<00:02:32.720> to<00:02:32.900> myself<00:02:33.710> not<00:02:34.040> in<00:02:34.100> the

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
it if you wanted to myself not in the

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.310 
it if you wanted to myself not in the
naked<00:02:34.490> dancing

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
naked dancing

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.080 
naked dancing
besides<00:02:37.040> that<00:02:37.190> nobody<00:02:37.460> wants<00:02:37.670> to<00:02:37.730> see<00:02:37.910> this

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
besides that nobody wants to see this

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.320 
besides that nobody wants to see this
naked<00:02:38.450> anyway<00:02:39.820> thought<00:02:40.820> I'd<00:02:40.970> give<00:02:41.120> you<00:02:41.210> a<00:02:41.270> shot

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.480 
naked anyway thought I'd give you a shot
at<00:02:41.630> that<00:02:41.830> I'm<00:02:42.830> gonna<00:02:42.980> bring<00:02:43.130> it<00:02:43.280> down<00:02:43.310> the

basement now for a wife that took me a

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.400 
basement now for a wife that took me a
little<00:02:48.920> while<00:02:49.070> I<00:02:49.640> came<00:02:50.420> to<00:02:50.660> put<00:02:50.810> the<00:02:50.930> plans<00:02:51.170> in

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
little while I came to put the plans in

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.430 
little while I came to put the plans in
my<00:02:51.560> head<00:02:51.770> I<00:02:51.800> didn't<00:02:52.160> write<00:02:52.340> anything<00:02:52.610> down

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
my head I didn't write anything down

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.010 
my head I didn't write anything down
it's<00:02:54.440> all<00:02:54.620> screwed<00:02:55.010> together<00:02:55.870> and<00:02:56.870> there's

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
it's all screwed together and there's

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:58.900 
it's all screwed together and there's
even<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.680> screws<00:02:57.920> holding<00:02:58.130> the<00:02:58.340> top<00:02:58.400> on<00:02:58.790> her

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
even the screws holding the top on her

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.140 
even the screws holding the top on her
two<00:02:59.090> inches<00:02:59.420> long<00:02:59.690> so<00:03:00.470> it's<00:03:00.590> not<00:03:00.739> coming<00:03:01.040> apart

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
two inches long so it's not coming apart

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.180 
two inches long so it's not coming apart
in<00:03:02.150> any<00:03:02.510> manner<00:03:02.870> I<00:03:03.200> wouldn't<00:03:03.650> be<00:03:03.739> afraid<00:03:04.040> to

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
in any manner I wouldn't be afraid to

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.820 
in any manner I wouldn't be afraid to
reload<00:03:04.550> on<00:03:04.700> this<00:03:04.910> thing<00:03:05.120> it's<00:03:05.959> pretty<00:03:06.170> solid<00:03:06.410> I

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
reload on this thing it's pretty solid I

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:15.810 
reload on this thing it's pretty solid I
browned<00:03:07.700> it<00:03:08.770> see<00:03:09.770> if<00:03:09.860> I<00:03:09.950> can<00:03:10.070> leave<00:03:10.190> this<00:03:10.400> over

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.310 

so<00:03:16.820> yeah<00:03:16.940> well<00:03:17.209> you<00:03:17.330> can<00:03:17.450> see<00:03:17.660> that<00:03:17.840> on<00:03:18.140> the

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
so yeah well you can see that on the

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.370 
so yeah well you can see that on the
bottom<00:03:18.650> of<00:03:18.709> the<00:03:18.830> feet<00:03:19.720> bottom<00:03:20.720> of<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:20.870> legs<00:03:21.140> I

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
bottom of the feet bottom of the legs I

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.979 
bottom of the feet bottom of the legs I
rounded<00:03:21.860> them<00:03:21.950> off<00:03:22.330> and<00:03:23.330> that's<00:03:23.540> just<00:03:23.810> so<00:03:23.959> that

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
rounded them off and that's just so that

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:27.490 
rounded them off and that's just so that
if<00:03:24.200> it<00:03:24.350> gets<00:03:24.920> dragged<00:03:25.340> anywhere<00:03:26.380> that<00:03:27.380> it's

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
if it gets dragged anywhere that it's

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.790 
if it gets dragged anywhere that it's
not<00:03:27.680> coming<00:03:27.980> across<00:03:28.130> a<00:03:28.340> hard<00:03:28.670> 90-degree<00:03:29.270> edge

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
not coming across a hard 90-degree edge

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.500 
not coming across a hard 90-degree edge
and<00:03:30.800> it'll<00:03:31.130> be<00:03:31.220> easier<00:03:31.550> to<00:03:31.610> drag<00:03:31.880> plus<00:03:32.360> it

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
and it'll be easier to drag plus it

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.720 
and it'll be easier to drag plus it
won't<00:03:32.660> fall<00:03:32.900> apart

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
won't fall apart

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.140 
won't fall apart
not<00:03:35.150> that<00:03:35.360> this<00:03:35.480> is<00:03:35.630> gonna<00:03:35.810> fall<00:03:36.020> apart<00:03:36.050> anyway

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
not that this is gonna fall apart anyway

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:44.050 
not that this is gonna fall apart anyway
so<00:03:38.150> that's<00:03:39.110> ah<00:03:39.440> that's<00:03:42.310> a<00:03:43.310> new<00:03:43.430> shelf<00:03:43.700> with<00:03:43.940> my

make me put a shelf underneath it too oh

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.040 
make me put a shelf underneath it too oh
