00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.910
 hello and welcome his diary geek 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.940
 is asean and I am currently at 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.680
 the ufa 2012 to basle an ace that presented 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.010
 so again serve the galaxy note 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.170
 who takes the difficult task 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.730
 galaxy bread note it was very very 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.170
 very well sold so at the level of 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.939
 features found now 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.870
 a 5.5 inch screen with a 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.180
 hd resolution so 1280 by 720 this is 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.640
 more than 7/10 as on the galaxy note 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.550
 it's a hd screen super amoled a 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.719
 quad core processor exynos stretcher so 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.930
 a little bit faster than the 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.820
 galaxy s iii 2 gigas of ram 16 and 32 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.149
 gigas of internal memory a microsd port 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.559
 a micro sim port also an apn 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.870
 backlit 8 megapixel with a 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.250
 video camera 1.9 pixels 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.770
 the classical recording 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.570
 the new style and espen so they 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.730
 chelsea with new applications 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.890
 is necessarily new functions 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.360
 like the review the pop-up teams 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.549
 or else the handwriting recognition 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.050
 so all this in a new package to 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.630
 from 550 euros on average 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.040
 from this month of October so at the level of 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.500
 good design 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.290
 does not change much since we find 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.840
 sorry we found a little this design 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:26.380
 similar a galaxy s iii in bigger 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.930
 so they see the meeting at 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.840
 above you find the apn visio in 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.150
 down the famous the famous home button 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.890
 with the two sensory buttons so that 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.130
 never sounded to keep trying to 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.710
 continue on not proposing the 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.170
 navigation to 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.979
 as would like android in his 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.780
 basic version 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:50.369
 here you have apn so 8 megapixel 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.530
 ricard and so it's the same as on the 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.940
 galaxy s iii 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.020
 so that's in terms of luca patrick 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.850
 haumont I will not go back on 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.030
 since it's pretty classic and then at 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.440
 ultimately the performance of the 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.619
 galaxy s iii beats it's going to be the same 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.570
 thing with with enough performance 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.300
 similar on a larger screen so 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.450
 due that at the density level a whole 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.040
 little bit weaker but in 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.690
 in the absolute we would not want too much 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.849
 difference the big novelty it's 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.280
 so this new setback espen so we 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:22.099
 found on the bench and it is enough 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.260
 to take off this week and to see 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.640
 that a first menu will appear when 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.010
 even much healthier whose famous 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.220
 pop up that helps write will dive and 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:34.400
 you see here already the precision of the 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.920
 stylus it's pretty amazing to have 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.600
 been a galaxy user rating this is 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.310
 something quite 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.750
 these jesters because I did not think 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.370
 that we could expect this kind I 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.530
 so from then on you are really in mode 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.540
 creative or something like that the 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.100
 taking notes we are calling you 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.990
 take out the style and the pop up device 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.120
 wanted to take notes quickly on 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.680
 know that very well you have 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.020
 actually also always this menu 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.760
 now I hope you find 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.110
 Also worth noting on 10 point gerritsen 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.510
 and the first galaxy note 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.100
 so he will allow more things 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.690
 if not in terms of 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.840
 in terms of application it's the same 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.950
 it's always you since oysters 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.240
 like we do not like that it's our 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.530
 case 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.860
 there I meet a little 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.400
 I did 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.400
 a crisis of notes 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.170
 all customer options and like 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.660
 usually you have 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.750
 this management of this management of 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.050
 pressure that make me part of 1024 levels 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.300
 pension 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.880
 the law and that I can stay there until then 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:39.290
 what I can do is here 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.290
 just write quickly and 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.340
 you can see that everything is taken in 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.060
 it's pretty bluffing 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.750
 alex gopher 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.750
 another thing 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.190
 something else 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.540
 composed by 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.980
 which is quite a lot of 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.250
 it 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:04.480
 it is this side 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:08.230
 so I show you quickly the 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:11.480
 gallery that is just one of the ways 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.760
 the fastest to discover wildlife 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.980
 a view actually allows the close of the 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.609
 baudoin stylus and there to be able to have a 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.150
 preview 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:23.000
 it's pretty defensive and 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.740
 and it's super convenient so is the 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.200
 also works for the mails it works 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.820
 also for everything you need 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.440
 for compatible applications this 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:34.300
 course I liked it does not work but we 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.300
 will launch an animate for example 

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:38.189
 for inevitably these two sailors 

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:39.860
 you have the title and all that so that's 

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:42.770
 really nice 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.490
 it gives us a little more insight 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.180
 productivity 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.180
 here 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.729
 here I think I applied to the trick 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.440
 so if you have questions from our 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.780
 do not hesitate we obviously wait 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.169
 impatiently at the office to be able to 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.750
 test 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:59.090
 since it only goes out in October but 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.350
 we expect from below do not hesitate in 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.889
 comments and see you soon 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.889
