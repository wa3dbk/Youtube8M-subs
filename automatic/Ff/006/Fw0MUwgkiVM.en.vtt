00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
good girl so I'm just looking into the

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.210 
good girl so I'm just looking into the
mouth<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:22.230> see<00:00:22.380> if<00:00:22.470> there's<00:00:22.619> any<00:00:22.769> mucus

mouth to see if there's any mucus

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.070 
mouth to see if there's any mucus
because<00:00:23.430> they<00:00:23.550> can<00:00:23.699> give<00:00:23.850> me<00:00:23.939> an<00:00:24.029> idea<00:00:24.180> if

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
because they can give me an idea if

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.890 
because they can give me an idea if
there<00:00:25.289> is<00:00:25.439> still<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.680> problem<00:00:26.689> she's<00:00:27.689> got<00:00:27.869> very

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
there is still a problem she's got very

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.960 
there is still a problem she's got very
nice<00:00:28.380> good<00:00:28.740> party<00:00:29.039> condition<00:00:29.460> there<00:00:29.609> so<00:00:29.789> she's

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
nice good party condition there so she's

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:37.310 
nice good party condition there so she's
not<00:00:30.179> sin<00:00:34.160> I'm<00:00:35.300> listening<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.750> lungs<00:00:37.020> and

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
not sin I'm listening to the lungs and

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.530 
not sin I'm listening to the lungs and
actual<00:00:37.710> ear<00:00:37.920> sex<00:00:38.250> which<00:00:38.579> birds<00:00:38.879> have<00:00:39.149> that<00:00:39.360> we

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
actual ear sex which birds have that we

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.010 
actual ear sex which birds have that we
don't<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.079> air<00:00:40.469> sacs<00:00:40.890> or<00:00:41.160> big<00:00:41.850> spaces<00:00:42.480> that

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
don't and air sacs or big spaces that

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.569 
don't and air sacs or big spaces that
actually<00:00:43.410> help<00:00:43.590> with<00:00:43.649> their<00:00:43.950> buoyancy<00:00:44.280> in

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
actually help with their buoyancy in

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.130 
actually help with their buoyancy in
penguins<00:00:45.000> but<00:00:45.239> in<00:00:45.390> other<00:00:45.539> birds<00:00:45.750> actually

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
penguins but in other birds actually

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.740 
penguins but in other birds actually
keep<00:00:46.289> birds<00:00:46.469> light<00:00:46.800> so<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.190> they<00:00:47.340> can<00:00:47.550> fly

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
keep birds light so that they can fly

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.000 
keep birds light so that they can fly
but<00:00:48.750> they're<00:00:48.960> unfortunately<00:00:49.500> very<00:00:49.620> prone<00:00:49.980> to

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
but they're unfortunately very prone to

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.869 
but they're unfortunately very prone to
infections

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
infections

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.410 
infections
penguins<00:00:51.539> are<00:00:51.660> not<00:00:51.840> designed<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.530> live<00:00:53.420> in

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
penguins are not designed to live in

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.869 
penguins are not designed to live in
warm<00:00:54.809> places<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:55.710> we<00:00:56.129> wouldn't<00:00:56.430> think<00:00:56.579> hidden

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
warm places so we wouldn't think hidden

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.819 
warm places so we wouldn't think hidden
bridge<00:00:57.030> warm<00:00:57.270> but<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.629> for<00:00:57.989> them<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.320> so

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
bridge warm but it is for them and so

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.490 
bridge warm but it is for them and so
anywhere<00:00:59.670> in<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.940> world<00:01:00.149> outside<00:01:00.629> Antarctica

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
anywhere in the world outside Antarctica

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.740 
anywhere in the world outside Antarctica
penguins<00:01:01.859> are<00:01:01.980> prone<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.520> getting<00:01:02.750> little

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
penguins are prone to getting little

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.600 
penguins are prone to getting little
infections<00:01:04.260> in<00:01:04.409> their<00:01:04.589> lungs<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.460> we're

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
infections in their lungs and so we're

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.980 
infections in their lungs and so we're
just<00:01:05.640> making<00:01:05.790> sure<00:01:06.119> that<00:01:06.390> these<00:01:06.510> guys<00:01:06.570> are

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
just making sure that these guys are

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.560 
just making sure that these guys are
fine<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:10.280> do<00:01:11.280> have<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.580> be<00:01:11.670> very<00:01:11.909> careful<00:01:12.390> when<00:01:12.540> I

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
fine I do have to be very careful when I

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.359 
fine I do have to be very careful when I
work<00:01:12.840> in<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.470> penguin<00:01:13.770> enclosure<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.189> don't

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
work in the penguin enclosure I don't

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.160 
work in the penguin enclosure I don't
drop<00:01:14.549> anything<00:01:14.850> because<00:01:15.240> Gentoo<00:01:15.630> penguins

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
drop anything because Gentoo penguins

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.410 
drop anything because Gentoo penguins
unlike<00:01:16.890> most<00:01:17.070> other<00:01:17.250> penguins<00:01:17.729> will<00:01:18.150> swallow

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
unlike most other penguins will swallow

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.480 
unlike most other penguins will swallow
anything<00:01:19.020> so<00:01:19.439> they'll<00:01:19.710> swallow<00:01:19.979> children's

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
anything so they'll swallow children's

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.910 
anything so they'll swallow children's
gloves<00:01:20.790> will<00:01:21.479> toy<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:22.110> we<00:01:22.229> try<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.650> discourage

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
gloves will toy so we try and discourage

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.530 
gloves will toy so we try and discourage
the<00:01:23.189> public<00:01:23.520> from<00:01:23.640> coming<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.090> close<00:01:24.360> because

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
the public from coming to close because

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.120 
the public from coming to close because
if<00:01:24.780> they<00:01:24.930> feed<00:01:25.140> them<00:01:25.350> something<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.799> can<00:01:25.950> cause

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
if they feed them something it can cause

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.340 
if they feed them something it can cause
a<00:01:26.159> blockage<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.759> kill<00:01:26.970> them<00:01:27.180> right<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:28.259> I'm

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
a blockage and kill them right so I'm

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.510 
a blockage and kill them right so I'm
just<00:01:28.530> going<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.970> disinfect<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.210> skin<00:01:31.520> before

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
just going to disinfect the skin before

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.230 
just going to disinfect the skin before
we<00:01:32.610> take<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.820> little<00:01:33.060> blood<00:01:33.270> sample<00:01:33.840> so<00:01:35.090> this<00:01:36.090> is

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
we take a little blood sample so this is

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.030 
we take a little blood sample so this is
a<00:01:36.270> nice<00:01:36.540> little<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.290> only<00:01:37.320> little<00:01:37.770> bit<00:01:37.920> of

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
a nice little the only little bit of

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.630 
a nice little the only little bit of
skin<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.119> doesn't<00:01:40.040> isn't<00:01:41.040> completely

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
skin that doesn't isn't completely

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.980 
skin that doesn't isn't completely
covered<00:01:42.090> with<00:01:42.119> feathers<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.659> there's<00:01:42.960> a

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
covered with feathers and there's a

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.240 
covered with feathers and there's a
little<00:01:43.110> blood<00:01:43.350> vessel<00:01:43.710> there<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.009> we<00:01:44.100> can

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
little blood vessel there that we can

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.720 
little blood vessel there that we can
get<00:01:44.399> some<00:01:44.579> blood<00:01:44.729> from

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:50.730 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.640 

so<00:01:51.730> we<00:01:51.880> only<00:01:52.030> need<00:01:52.300> a<00:01:52.330> very<00:01:52.420> small<00:01:52.750> quantity<00:01:53.620> of

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
so we only need a very small quantity of

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.410 
so we only need a very small quantity of
blood<00:01:53.920> that's<00:01:54.610> a<00:01:54.820> good<00:01:54.970> thing<00:01:55.090> we<00:01:55.210> don't<00:01:55.300> have

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
blood that's a good thing we don't have

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.060 
blood that's a good thing we don't have
to<00:01:55.600> take<00:01:55.780> very<00:01:56.020> much<00:01:56.230> so<00:01:56.500> it's<00:01:56.650> almost<00:01:56.860> like

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
to take very much so it's almost like

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.410 
to take very much so it's almost like
they<00:01:57.250> scratch<00:01:57.520> their<00:01:57.760> nail<00:01:57.970> and<00:01:58.210> they<00:01:58.270> had<00:01:58.390> a

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
they scratch their nail and they had a

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.670 
they scratch their nail and they had a
little<00:01:58.510> bit<00:01:58.630> of<00:01:58.750> bleeding<00:01:59.140> it's<00:01:59.290> not<00:01:59.470> a<00:01:59.500> big

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
little bit of bleeding it's not a big

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.980 
little bit of bleeding it's not a big
thing<00:01:59.710> for<00:01:59.920> them<00:02:00.160> what<00:02:00.850> she's<00:02:01.450> unhappy<00:02:01.900> about

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
thing for them what she's unhappy about

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.930 
thing for them what she's unhappy about
his<00:02:02.140> being<00:02:02.440> held<00:02:02.710> because<00:02:03.070> the<00:02:03.190> only<00:02:03.340> time<00:02:03.460> a

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
his being held because the only time a

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.940 
his being held because the only time a
penguin<00:02:04.510> would<00:02:04.720> actually<00:02:05.110> ever<00:02:05.290> be<00:02:05.470> held<00:02:05.680> as

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
penguin would actually ever be held as

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.350 
penguin would actually ever be held as
if<00:02:06.100> it<00:02:06.190> was<00:02:06.340> in<00:02:06.490> the<00:02:06.520> mouth<00:02:06.730> of<00:02:06.880> a<00:02:06.940> leopard<00:02:07.210> seal

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
if it was in the mouth of a leopard seal

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.180 
if it was in the mouth of a leopard seal
eating<00:02:07.810> it<00:02:07.930> so<00:02:08.110> they're<00:02:08.680> not<00:02:08.800> bothered<00:02:09.160> about

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
eating it so they're not bothered about

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.469 
eating it so they're not bothered about
the<00:02:09.430> blood<00:02:09.610> sample<00:02:10.060> they're<00:02:10.210> actually<00:02:10.450> just

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
the blood sample they're actually just

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.230 
the blood sample they're actually just
don't<00:02:10.720> like<00:02:10.930> being<00:02:11.140> held<00:02:11.790> so<00:02:12.790> let's<00:02:13.030> have<00:02:13.180> a

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
don't like being held so let's have a

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.590 
don't like being held so let's have a
look<00:02:13.360> if<00:02:13.510> it<00:02:13.630> stopped<00:02:15.180> that's<00:02:16.180> good<00:02:16.390> that

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
look if it stopped that's good that

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.930 
look if it stopped that's good that
stopped<00:02:16.870> so<00:02:17.170> it's<00:02:17.890> not<00:02:18.100> too<00:02:18.310> cold<00:02:18.520> today<00:02:18.730> but

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
stopped so it's not too cold today but

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.160 
stopped so it's not too cold today but
on<00:02:19.030> a<00:02:19.060> cold<00:02:19.360> morning<00:02:19.420> the<00:02:19.810> little<00:02:20.020> blood

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
on a cold morning the little blood

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.380 
on a cold morning the little blood
vessels<00:02:20.530> contract<00:02:21.070> in<00:02:21.280> a<00:02:21.340> Penguin's<00:02:21.670> foot<00:02:22.150> and

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
vessels contract in a Penguin's foot and

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.120 
vessels contract in a Penguin's foot and
it<00:02:22.780> makes<00:02:22.930> it<00:02:23.050> really<00:02:23.260> difficult<00:02:23.560> for<00:02:23.920> me<00:02:24.010> to

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
it makes it really difficult for me to

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.070 
it makes it really difficult for me to
get<00:02:24.250> a<00:02:24.310> blood<00:02:24.520> sample<00:02:24.790> it's<00:02:25.510> one<00:02:25.720> of<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:25.870> few

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
get a blood sample it's one of the few

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.960 
get a blood sample it's one of the few
places<00:02:26.260> they<00:02:26.530> can<00:02:26.710> regulate<00:02:26.980> their<00:02:27.730> body

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
places they can regulate their body

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.790 
places they can regulate their body
temperature<00:02:28.320> because<00:02:29.320> it's<00:02:29.470> not<00:02:29.590> covered

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
temperature because it's not covered

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.410 
temperature because it's not covered
with<00:02:29.920> feathers<00:02:30.190> so<00:02:30.520> the<00:02:30.670> way<00:02:30.790> this<00:02:30.940> hot<00:02:31.180> they

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
with feathers so the way this hot they

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.670 
with feathers so the way this hot they
can<00:02:31.570> use<00:02:31.720> a<00:02:31.750> bit<00:02:31.930> of<00:02:32.020> heat<00:02:32.140> from<00:02:32.350> their<00:02:32.500> feet

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
can use a bit of heat from their feet

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.710 
can use a bit of heat from their feet
and<00:02:33.070> if<00:02:33.220> it's<00:02:33.400> cold<00:02:33.730> so<00:02:33.910> they<00:02:34.000> also<00:02:34.150> constrict

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
and if it's cold so they also constrict

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.300 
and if it's cold so they also constrict
the<00:02:34.810> blood<00:02:34.840> vessels<00:02:35.380> so<00:02:35.440> they<00:02:35.650> don't<00:02:35.830> use<00:02:36.070> heat

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
the blood vessels so they don't use heat

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.950 
the blood vessels so they don't use heat
through<00:02:36.520> their<00:02:36.670> feet<00:02:36.850> right<00:02:37.420> let's<00:02:37.660> put<00:02:37.840> it

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
through their feet right let's put it

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:49.550 
through their feet right let's put it
down<00:02:40.020> say<00:02:41.020> there's<00:02:41.230> no<00:02:41.380> my<00:02:41.530> throat

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:03:02.340 

sure<00:02:50.160> none<00:02:50.819> the<00:02:50.970> worse<00:02:51.120> for<00:02:51.180> wear

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350
