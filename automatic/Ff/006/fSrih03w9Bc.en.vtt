00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
great so at this point I have a nice

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:04.230 
great so at this point I have a nice
shallow<00:02:01.780> well<00:02:02.560> but<00:02:03.189> I<00:02:03.219> can't<00:02:03.549> throw<00:02:03.880> a<00:02:03.909> pop

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
shallow well but I can't throw a pop

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.569 
shallow well but I can't throw a pop
from<00:02:04.479> this<00:02:04.659> at<00:02:04.840> this<00:02:04.990> stage<00:02:05.049> I<00:02:05.590> have<00:02:06.100> to<00:02:06.310> have<00:02:06.549> a

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:06.579 
from this at this stage I have to have a

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:10.070 
from this at this stage I have to have a
nice<00:02:07.210> flat<00:02:07.780> bottom<00:02:08.229> with<00:02:09.009> a<00:02:09.310> perpendicular

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
nice flat bottom with a perpendicular

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.080 
nice flat bottom with a perpendicular
wall<00:02:11.080> on<00:02:11.769> the<00:02:12.129> sides<00:02:12.340> with<00:02:12.550> a<00:02:12.610> nice<00:02:12.790> right

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
wall on the sides with a nice right

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.710 
wall on the sides with a nice right
angle

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
angle

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.979 
angle
so<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:14.739> way<00:02:14.860> I<00:02:14.890> do<00:02:15.040> this<00:02:15.190> is<00:02:15.670> kind<00:02:16.599> of<00:02:16.629> a<00:02:16.720> hand

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
so the way I do this is kind of a hand

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.400 
so the way I do this is kind of a hand
over<00:02:17.230> hand<00:02:17.470> motion<00:02:18.010> a<00:02:18.220> crab<00:02:19.209> claw<00:02:19.629> backwards

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
over hand motion a crab claw backwards

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.759 
over hand motion a crab claw backwards
see<00:02:20.920> right<00:02:21.879> at<00:02:22.000> six<00:02:22.330> o'clock<00:02:22.420> with<00:02:23.349> my<00:02:23.530> right

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
hand over it I'm going to wrap my

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.900 
hand over it I'm going to wrap my
fingers<00:02:26.170> all<00:02:26.319> the<00:02:26.349> way<00:02:26.530> around<00:02:26.830> my<00:02:26.950> thumb<00:02:27.220> you

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.660 
fingers all the way around my thumb you
can<00:02:28.060> see<00:02:28.269> is<00:02:28.390> on<00:02:28.540> this<00:02:28.720> side<00:02:28.989> here<00:02:29.670> providing

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
can see is on this side here providing

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.190 
can see is on this side here providing
support<00:02:31.060> and<00:02:31.329> I'm<00:02:32.049> going<00:02:32.260> to<00:02:32.670> drag<00:02:33.670> my<00:02:33.750> fingers

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200

toward my bellybutton keeping them level
so<00:02:40.489> I<00:02:40.580> don't<00:02:41.140> go<00:02:42.140> through<00:02:42.530> the<00:02:42.739> bottom<00:02:43.099> of<00:02:43.160> the

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
so I don't go through the bottom of the

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.540 
so I don't go through the bottom of the
pot

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.830 
the other way to do it is with a rig and
here's<00:04:04.650> a<00:04:04.709> bit<00:04:05.099> of<00:04:05.190> a<00:04:05.280> tip<00:04:05.489> don't<00:04:06.180> use<00:04:06.480> a<00:04:06.510> rib

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
here's a bit of a tip don't use a rib

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.110 
here's a bit of a tip don't use a rib
that<00:04:07.050> has<00:04:07.260> too<00:04:07.620> sharp<00:04:07.950> edges<00:04:08.280> like<00:04:08.760> this

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
that has too sharp edges like this

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.990 
that has too sharp edges like this
because<00:04:10.110> if<00:04:10.410> you<00:04:10.590> cross<00:04:10.860> that<00:04:11.099> centerline

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
because if you cross that centerline

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.690 
because if you cross that centerline
you'll<00:04:12.510> dig<00:04:12.840> into<00:04:13.019> your<00:04:13.230> pot<00:04:13.530> and<00:04:13.640> create<00:04:14.640> a

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
you'll dig into your pot and create a

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.759 
you'll dig into your pot and create a
nice<00:04:14.849> big<00:04:15.300> gouge<00:04:15.660> I<00:04:16.079> don't<00:04:16.320> think<00:04:16.500> you<00:04:16.590> want

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
nice big gouge I don't think you want

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.020 
nice big gouge I don't think you want
that

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
that

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.880 
that
if<00:04:18.450> you<00:04:18.600> have<00:04:18.720> a<00:04:18.750> rib<00:04:18.989> that<00:04:19.019> has<00:04:19.350> a<00:04:19.380> nice<00:04:19.620> edge

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
if you have a rib that has a nice edge

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.700 
if you have a rib that has a nice edge
here<00:04:20.310> and<00:04:20.519> then<00:04:20.730> a<00:04:20.820> gentle<00:04:21.329> curve<00:04:21.570> here<00:04:22.079> what

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
here and then a gentle curve here what

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.280 
here and then a gentle curve here what
you<00:04:22.860> do<00:04:23.010> is<00:04:23.100> you<00:04:23.190> insert<00:04:23.730> the<00:04:24.090> rib<00:04:24.600> at<00:04:24.990> three

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
you do is you insert the rib at three

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:26.870 
you do is you insert the rib at three
o'clock<00:04:25.530> flying<00:04:26.250> some<00:04:26.460> downward<00:04:26.670> pressure

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
o'clock flying some downward pressure

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.860 
o'clock flying some downward pressure
and<00:04:27.510> then<00:04:28.020> just<00:04:28.200> lightly<00:04:29.150> work<00:04:30.150> it<00:04:30.450> your<00:04:30.660> way

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
and then just lightly work it your way

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.630 
and then just lightly work it your way
towards<00:04:31.380> the<00:04:31.470> middle<00:04:31.890> and<00:04:32.570> that<00:04:33.570> curved<00:04:33.930> edge

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:34.640 
towards the middle and that curved edge

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.790 
towards the middle and that curved edge
doesn't<00:04:35.640> catch<00:04:36.210> on<00:04:36.630> the<00:04:37.200> other<00:04:37.320> side<00:04:37.590> of<00:04:37.620> the

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
doesn't catch on the other side of the

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.710 
doesn't catch on the other side of the
pot<00:04:37.980> and<00:04:38.280> drag<00:04:38.580> it<00:04:38.760> around<00:04:39.000> inside<00:04:39.240> of<00:04:39.600> your

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
pot and drag it around inside of your

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.460 
pot and drag it around inside of your
pot<00:04:40.490> so<00:04:41.490> now<00:04:41.640> that<00:04:41.730> I've<00:04:41.910> done<00:04:42.810> that<00:04:42.870> I've<00:04:43.350> got

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
pot so now that I've done that I've got

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:53.159 
pot so now that I've done that I've got
a<00:04:43.500> nice<00:04:43.800> smooth<00:04:44.580> inside<00:04:45.090> of<00:04:45.240> the<00:04:45.330> pot

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169
