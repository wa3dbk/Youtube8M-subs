00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello everyone how are welcome once 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.060
 again to my channel as you know I am 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.790
 sad yang auriverde fashion compass 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.190
 dotcom and upload a new video all 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.870
 every Thursday in today's video 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.700
 let's talk a little bit about how 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.470
 plan our lives because I know that 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.210
 many times we are singing like 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.920
 that we do not have time or that we have 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.230
 a lot of things to do and we do not 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.539
 reaches the time and always the time in 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.279
 time becomes the excuse then in 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.080
 the first part of the video I'm going to 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.420
 tell why it is important to plan 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.399
 our life and in the second part they 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.739
 I'm going to show how I plan to measure and 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.480
 as marin july my agenda as the 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.329
 waters and applications use in the cell phone 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.610
 to organize my life and also as a 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.500
 manuality of how yourselves can 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.750
 create your own agenda or your own 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.640
 glider and good is a super libretto 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.129
 basic that we ourselves can 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.949
 fix and put it super pretty then 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.930
 continue with this video when we plan 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.570
 our future and it's not like something super 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.850
 far in four years five years but 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.980
 that tomorrow in an hour that 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.320
 it is also part of the future then 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.760
 we have to know what we are going to do and 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.530
 what is the step we are going to 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.390
 and I do not know if it happens to you but 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.340
 for example, when I have lists of 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.470
 check it is much easier for me 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.780
 how to fulfill my activities because I 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.030
 I set goals and I know that on a certain day 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.980
 I have to do those activities and without 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.900
 import at what time I do them or that 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.340
 do first that the other I know that that is 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.620
 what I have to do and I love 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.450
 check what I already have ready this 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.850
 It is also very good because it helps us 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.890
 have self-discipline and is that very many 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.900
 times for not knowing how to distribute our 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.000
 time in so many activities that we have 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.860
 to do many times we say no 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.810
 I have time I stayed short of time 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.340
 I did not manage to comply and also we were 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.979
 they forget things then that 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.360
 it's definitely not what we want 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.220
 remember that to plan your life and your 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.840
 activities it is very important that you have 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.430
 an integral vision of everything that 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.100
 you have to do for example do 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.440
 exercise or work or study or your 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.240
 personal relationships all that is super 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.100
 important and you have to give equal 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.110
 importance to plan we have to be 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.060
 very realistic and know the resources that 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.220
 we have for example look at our money 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.170
 or our time or our disposition 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.390
 because that's going to make us have a lot 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.460
 more successful when it comes to planning our 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.490
 life and sometimes for example it happens to me 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.830
 that I have a task for a month and 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.140
 so I let that happen and that 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.030
 spend time and like two days 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.620
 before handing over the task because I already 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.960
 he caught the afternoon and I do not know what to do 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.480
 then I have to run and the 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.640
 pressure stress like sweat tears and 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.710
 blood to accomplish the task and 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.020
 really that's not what we want and 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.000
 finally it is essential that we do 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.040
 lists of things that we will forget 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.020
 when I have many things of the 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.880
 that I have to remember, I feel like a 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.590
 permanent stress that is not going to 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.150
 forget and that I have to do it and 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.760
 when I'm going to do it but when I 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.250
 I feel what I write I organize my ideas and 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.290
 I know at what time and do everything all 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.800
 It's much easier and I'm free because 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.210
 I feel that on paper I have my backing 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.820
 the first application that I want them 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.770
 show is in class here I administer all 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.600
 my university life and I have the 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.000
 notebooks of all semesters by the 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.950
 I've been there I can put the 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.990
 matters and for example here I am going to 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.520
 show this where I have the whole state 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.280
 of my teachers with the phones 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.320
 emails in case I need it and 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.460
 I also make the annotations of the 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.200
 classes how to overcome 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.660
 an ordinary notebook and I 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.850
 classified by subject, I can also 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.890
 put images voice notes and also 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.080
 is this part where he administered my 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.630
 partial tasks of evaluations good 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.790
 whatever it is I can prioritize or 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.340
 I can post comments and I can also 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.320
 put an alarm to organize my 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.180
 notebook or that is very basic I will 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.190
 start designing some gliders 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.290
 weekly I really like to know how 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.230
 what do I have to do every week day to 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.970
 day and then I designed these but in 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.620
 internet there are so many of you 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.440
 You can find there and get off 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.570
 print them then print it the size 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.300
 of my notebook and now I'm going to 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:00.240
 show what we are going to do then 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.770
 occupy markers a super notebook 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.320
 I love this little one because 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:07.050

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.139
 do 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.139
 in the back I'm going to start 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:23.610
 gluing the gliders that print 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:25.979
 week by week 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.650

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:30.419
