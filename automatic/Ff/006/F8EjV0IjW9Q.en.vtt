and<00:00:12.180> today<00:00:12.630> I'm<00:00:12.720> going<00:00:12.840> to<00:00:12.900> show<00:00:13.080> you<00:00:13.110> how<00:00:13.380> to

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
and today I'm going to show you how to

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.250 
and today I'm going to show you how to
check<00:00:13.740> out<00:00:13.920> your<00:00:14.070> stock<00:00:14.550> regulator<00:00:15.390> using<00:00:15.750> a

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
check out your stock regulator using a

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.200 
check out your stock regulator using a
voltmeter<00:00:16.820> set<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.000> diode<00:00:18.300> check<00:00:18.870> and<00:00:20.210> get

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
voltmeter set to a diode check and get

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.240 
voltmeter set to a diode check and get
here<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.600> show<00:00:22.050> you<00:00:22.110> what<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.350> do<00:00:22.470> okay<00:00:22.950> first

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
here to show you what to do okay first

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.550 
here to show you what to do okay first
we're<00:00:23.340> going<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.490> start<00:00:23.700> with<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:23.820> positive

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
we're going to start with a positive

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.089 
we're going to start with a positive
lead<00:00:25.560> of<00:00:25.860> your<00:00:26.070> multimeter<00:00:26.520> okay<00:00:27.450> and<00:00:28.099> I'm

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
lead of your multimeter okay and I'm

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.200 
lead of your multimeter okay and I'm
going<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.460> take<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:29.790> make<00:00:29.880> this<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.090> little

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
going to take and make this a little

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.179 
going to take and make this a little
easier<00:00:30.360> on<00:00:30.509> myself<00:00:30.750> so<00:00:31.080> I'm<00:00:31.169> use<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:31.560> clip<00:00:31.890> and

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
easier on myself so I'm use it clip and

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.230 
easier on myself so I'm use it clip and
hook<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.150> on<00:00:33.300> here<00:00:34.640> okay<00:00:35.640> so<00:00:35.700> that's<00:00:35.970> positive

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:36.240 
hook it on here okay so that's positive

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.610 
hook it on here okay so that's positive
and<00:00:36.600> going<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:36.930> hook<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.290> our<00:00:37.380> positive

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
and going to hook it to our positive

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.310 
and going to hook it to our positive
lead<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.970> now<00:00:39.240> my<00:00:39.420> negative<00:00:39.780> lead<00:00:39.990> I'm<00:00:40.170> going

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
lead and now my negative lead I'm going

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.460 
lead and now my negative lead I'm going
to<00:00:40.380> take<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.130> touch<00:00:41.370> all<00:00:41.870> three<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:43.140> the

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:43.470 
to take and touch all three of the

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.600 
to take and touch all three of the
stator<00:00:43.829> connectors<00:00:44.430> we<00:00:45.390> got<00:00:45.540> zero<00:00:46.190> zero<00:00:47.190> and

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
stator connectors we got zero zero and

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
stator connectors we got zero zero and
zero<00:00:48.620> which<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.800> good<00:00:50.010> okay<00:00:50.700> now<00:00:51.420> we'll

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:51.630 
zero which is good okay now we'll

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.750 
zero which is good okay now we'll
connect<00:00:51.990> it<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.950> the<00:00:53.070> negative<00:00:55.670> coming<00:00:56.670> from

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
connect it to the negative coming from

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.139 
connect it to the negative coming from
the<00:00:56.880> battery<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.480> check<00:00:58.230> again

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:16.669 

okay<00:01:01.870> we<00:01:02.050> got<00:01:02.199> 521<00:01:04.740> 510<00:01:05.740> and<00:01:07.740> 525

00:01:16.669 --> 00:01:16.679 

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:18.410 

first<00:01:17.250> time<00:01:17.399> we<00:01:17.520> had<00:01:17.640> zero<00:01:17.939> so<00:01:18.149> I'll<00:01:18.240> write

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
first time we had zero so I'll write

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.270 
first time we had zero so I'll write
those<00:01:18.600> down<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:19.079> we<00:01:19.170> got<00:01:19.289> a<00:01:19.320> set<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.560> zeros<00:01:19.920> and

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
those down so we got a set of zeros and

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.459 
those down so we got a set of zeros and
we<00:01:21.179> got<00:01:21.329> this<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:21.750> would<00:01:21.869> still<00:01:22.079> that's<00:01:22.259> good

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:22.469 
we got this that would still that's good

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:25.429 
we got this that would still that's good
they're<00:01:22.890> close<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.939> each<00:01:24.060> other<00:01:24.210> okay<00:01:25.140> so<00:01:25.229> now

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
they're close to each other okay so now

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.740 
they're close to each other okay so now
we're<00:01:25.590> going<00:01:25.679> to<00:01:25.740> switch<00:01:25.920> our<00:01:26.130> leads<00:01:26.429> okay

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
we're going to switch our leads okay

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.149 
we're going to switch our leads okay
now<00:01:28.439> we're<00:01:28.649> going<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.799> do<00:01:29.329> the<00:01:30.329> negative<00:01:30.569> lead

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
now we're going to do the negative lead

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.249 
now we're going to do the negative lead
and<00:01:32.159> we'll<00:01:32.579> go<00:01:32.700> back<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.209> do<00:01:33.569> it<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:34.229> the

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
and we'll go back and do it to the

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.469 
and we'll go back and do it to the
positive<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.950> stay<00:01:35.159> straight<00:01:35.819> here<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.209> okay

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
positive to stay straight here so okay

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.870 
positive to stay straight here so okay
so<00:01:36.509> we<00:01:36.750> have<00:01:36.869> negative<00:01:37.130> go<00:01:38.130> into<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.399> positive

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
so we have negative go into the positive

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.080 
so we have negative go into the positive
side<00:01:39.179> and<00:01:39.539> we'll<00:01:40.409> check<00:01:40.679> each<00:01:40.979> state<00:01:41.759> or<00:01:41.909> wire

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
side and we'll check each state or wire

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:51.150 
side and we'll check each state or wire
now<00:01:44.929> 523<00:01:47.929> 5:14

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.160 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:59.240 

5:22

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.640 

and<00:02:00.250> I<00:02:00.400> forgot<00:02:00.670> to<00:02:00.730> get<00:02:00.850> one<00:02:01.030> already

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.389 

5:14

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.869 

okay<00:02:09.119> now<00:02:09.539> we'll<00:02:09.750> switch<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:10.019> and<00:02:10.500> go<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.250> the

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
okay now we'll switch it and go to the

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.690 
okay now we'll switch it and go to the
negative<00:02:12.870> lead<00:02:13.260> leaving<00:02:14.159> our<00:02:14.250> negatives

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
negative lead leaving our negatives

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.610 
negative lead leaving our negatives
still<00:02:14.940> hooked<00:02:15.120> up<00:02:15.299> and<00:02:15.569> we'll<00:02:16.230> check<00:02:16.409> our

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
still hooked up and we'll check our

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.240 
still hooked up and we'll check our
stator<00:02:16.920> again<00:02:17.670> we<00:02:17.970> should<00:02:18.150> have<00:02:18.330> all<00:02:18.480> zeros

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
stator again we should have all zeros

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.350 
stator again we should have all zeros
okay<00:02:20.250> there's<00:02:20.610> a<00:02:20.670> zero<00:02:20.970> zero<00:02:21.980> and<00:02:22.980> zero<00:02:23.849> and

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
okay there's a zero zero and zero and

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.759 
okay there's a zero zero and zero and
that<00:02:24.540> tells<00:02:24.780> us<00:02:24.959> that<00:02:25.079> the<00:02:25.230> diodes<00:02:25.590> are

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
that tells us that the diodes are

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.380 
that tells us that the diodes are
working<00:02:26.129> inside<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.730> regulator<00:02:27.150> because

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
working inside the regulator because

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.020 
working inside the regulator because
they're<00:02:27.599> just<00:02:27.750> one-way<00:02:28.170> valves<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:29.030> they're

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
they're just one-way valves and they're

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.670 
they're just one-way valves and they're
letting<00:02:30.239> electricity<00:02:30.900> go<00:02:31.110> through<00:02:31.349> one<00:02:31.500> way

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
letting electricity go through one way

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.220 
letting electricity go through one way
and<00:02:31.920> not<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.159> other<00:02:32.239> okay<00:02:33.239> so<00:02:33.810> here's<00:02:33.989> what<00:02:34.140> we

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
and not the other okay so here's what we

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.580 
and not the other okay so here's what we
got

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
got

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.390 
got

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
set Z Rose the first set of three

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.220 
set Z Rose the first set of three

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
of these three zeros there's a problem

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.170 
of these three zeros there's a problem
if<00:02:45.660> you<00:02:45.870> have<00:02:46.019> a<00:02:46.049> zero<00:02:46.590> in<00:02:46.709> any<00:02:47.489> of<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.790> number

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
if you have a zero in any of the number

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.349 
if you have a zero in any of the number
columns<00:02:48.629> like<00:02:48.900> it's<00:02:49.140> 523<00:02:49.980> zero<00:02:50.400> and<00:02:50.609> five<00:02:50.790> 22

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:51.359 
columns like it's 523 zero and five 22

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:54.440 
columns like it's 523 zero and five 22
you<00:02:52.019> have<00:02:52.170> a<00:02:52.200> burned<00:02:52.470> out<00:02:52.620> diet<00:02:53.180> okay<00:02:54.180> same

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
you have a burned out diet okay same

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.030 
you have a burned out diet okay same
with<00:02:54.599> the<00:02:54.690> top<00:02:54.870> one<00:02:55.079> if<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:55.290> have<00:02:55.379> a<00:02:55.409> zero<00:02:55.769> in

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
with the top one if you have a zero in

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.759 
with the top one if you have a zero in
any<00:02:56.159> of<00:02:56.310> these<00:02:56.430> or<00:02:57.090> in<00:02:57.569> any<00:02:57.720> of<00:02:57.870> these<00:02:57.989> you<00:02:58.590> have

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
any of these or in any of these you have

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.460 
any of these or in any of these you have
a<00:02:58.799> problem<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.609> diode<00:02:59.970> is<00:03:00.120> burned<00:03:00.359> out<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:00.870> it

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
a problem the diode is burned out and it

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.160 
a problem the diode is burned out and it
shows<00:03:01.709> that<00:03:01.739> you<00:03:01.890> have<00:03:02.099> a<00:03:02.129> dead<00:03:03.170> regulator

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
shows that you have a dead regulator

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.399 
shows that you have a dead regulator
rectifier<00:03:04.379> and<00:03:05.099> that's<00:03:05.700> on<00:03:05.849> a<00:03:05.879> stock<00:03:06.409> type

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:07.409 
rectifier and that's on a stock type

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:09.589 
rectifier and that's on a stock type
regulator<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:08.400> these<00:03:08.519> are<00:03:08.700> this<00:03:08.879> is<00:03:09.060> a<00:03:09.090> Yamaha

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
regulator and these are this is a Yamaha

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.680 
regulator and these are this is a Yamaha
one<00:03:09.840> but<00:03:10.470> they're<00:03:10.620> almost<00:03:10.799> all<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:11.400> same<00:03:11.690> so

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
one but they're almost all the same so

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.839 
one but they're almost all the same so
that's<00:03:13.349> that's<00:03:13.829> the<00:03:14.040> way<00:03:14.160> you<00:03:14.220> could<00:03:14.459> check<00:03:14.669> it

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
that's that's the way you could check it

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.490 
that's that's the way you could check it
and<00:03:14.970> then<00:03:15.030> your<00:03:15.569> maintenance<00:03:15.870> manual<00:03:16.410> of

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
and then your maintenance manual of

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.470 
and then your maintenance manual of
course<00:03:16.769> you<00:03:16.889> want<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:17.069> look<00:03:17.160> and<00:03:17.370> see<00:03:17.549> how<00:03:17.700> you

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
course you want to look and see how you

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.089 
course you want to look and see how you
know<00:03:18.510> it's<00:03:18.720> check<00:03:19.349> there<00:03:19.590> too<00:03:19.859> but<00:03:20.010> remember

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
know it's check there too but remember

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:21.890 
know it's check there too but remember
it's<00:03:20.489> always<00:03:20.639> unplugged<00:03:21.209> when<00:03:21.389> you<00:03:21.630> do<00:03:21.750> these

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
it's always unplugged when you do these

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.020 
it's always unplugged when you do these
checks<00:03:22.230> and<00:03:22.650> that's<00:03:23.609> it

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
checks and that's it

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.180 
checks and that's it
and<00:03:24.120> I'm<00:03:24.780> Jack<00:03:25.049> from<00:03:25.079> row<00:03:25.379> to<00:03:25.410> cycle<00:03:25.829> comm
