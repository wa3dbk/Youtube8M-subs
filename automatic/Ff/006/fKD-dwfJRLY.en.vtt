00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.510 
the middle of nowhere it's so beautiful
and<00:02:14.380> it<00:02:15.380> just<00:02:15.590> seemed<00:02:15.740> like<00:02:15.770> the<00:02:15.980> only<00:02:16.100> place

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
and it just seemed like the only place

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.330 
and it just seemed like the only place
we<00:02:16.730> would<00:02:16.970> go<00:02:17.240> and<00:02:17.680> it's<00:02:18.680> one<00:02:18.920> of<00:02:18.950> those<00:02:19.130> places

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
we would go and it's one of those places

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.729 
we would go and it's one of those places
that<00:02:19.640> everyone<00:02:20.180> should<00:02:20.390> go<00:02:20.660> to<00:02:20.720> I<00:02:21.320> think

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
that everyone should go to I think

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.500 
that everyone should go to I think
because<00:02:22.250> it<00:02:22.520> just<00:02:22.670> changes<00:02:23.090> your<00:02:23.150> perspective

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
because it just changes your perspective

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.729 
because it just changes your perspective
on<00:02:23.900> how<00:02:24.110> you<00:02:24.170> live<00:02:25.000> for<00:02:26.000> us<00:02:26.060> North<00:02:26.989> Dakota<00:02:27.410> it's

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
on how you live for us North Dakota it's

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.750 
on how you live for us North Dakota it's
kind<00:02:28.100> of<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:28.400> grand<00:02:28.850> American<00:02:29.510> landscape
