00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
i'm also a beginner so i would always

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.940 
i'm also a beginner so i would always
try<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.360> give<00:01:09.810> an<00:01:10.049> illustration<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:10.920> I

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
try to give an illustration so I

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.830 
try to give an illustration so I
initially<00:01:11.490> wanted<00:01:11.610> something<00:01:12.060> like<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.420> and

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
initially wanted something like this and

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.590 
initially wanted something like this and
then<00:01:13.590> like<00:01:14.100> just<00:01:14.340> mimicking<00:01:14.939> all<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.210> pattern

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
then like just mimicking all the pattern

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.690 
then like just mimicking all the pattern
here<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.200> just<00:01:16.650> doing<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:16.979> all<00:01:17.159> over<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.520> cake

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
here and just doing it all over the cake

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.590 
here and just doing it all over the cake
but<00:01:18.479> it's<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:18.810> hard<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:19.200> do<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.470> because<00:01:19.890> it's

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
but it's so hard to do that because it's

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.260 
but it's so hard to do that because it's
it's<00:01:21.600> some<00:01:22.070> very<00:01:23.070> time-consuming<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:24.090> you'd

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
it's some very time-consuming and you'd

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.800 
it's some very time-consuming and you'd
have<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:25.460> punch<00:01:26.460> holes<00:01:26.820> over<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.509> over<00:01:27.570> again

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
have to punch holes over and over again

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.910 
have to punch holes over and over again
and<00:01:28.200> put<00:01:28.409> luster<00:01:28.799> dust<00:01:28.950> in<00:01:30.380> and<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.560> don't<00:01:31.770> have

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
and put luster dust in and I don't have

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.840 
and put luster dust in and I don't have
an<00:01:32.100> airbrush<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.540> it's<00:01:34.320> very<00:01:34.470> very

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
an airbrush so it's very very

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.940 
an airbrush so it's very very
time-consuming<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.780> after<00:01:37.170> making<00:01:37.350> that<00:01:37.530> I

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
time-consuming so after making that I

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.520 
time-consuming so after making that I
figured<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.579> wanted<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.840> cake<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.079> look<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.439> lot

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
carve out the sides of the cake carbon

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.090 
carve out the sides of the cake carbon
Mount<00:03:11.820> slanted<00:03:12.480> so<00:03:15.140> do<00:03:16.140> that<00:03:16.380> carve<00:03:16.800> them<00:03:16.950> out

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
Mount slanted so do that carve them out

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.740 
Mount slanted so do that carve them out
until<00:03:18.030> it<00:03:18.150> looks<00:03:18.360> like<00:03:18.840> that<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:20.040> then<00:03:20.850> for

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
until it looks like that and then for

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.780 
until it looks like that and then for
the<00:03:21.870> angled<00:03:22.260> look<00:03:22.410> on<00:03:22.560> top<00:03:22.830> you<00:03:23.459> would<00:03:23.610> also

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
the angled look on top you would also

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.160 
the angled look on top you would also
need<00:03:24.150> to<00:03:24.209> slice<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:24.840> cake<00:03:26.060> so<00:03:27.060> if<00:03:27.360> you<00:03:27.780> already

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
need to slice the cake so if you already

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.480 
need to slice the cake so if you already
have<00:03:28.650> say<00:03:29.090> three<00:03:30.500> layers<00:03:31.500> of<00:03:31.770> cake<00:03:31.980> inside<00:03:32.280> and

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.490 
have say three layers of cake inside and

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.790 
have say three layers of cake inside and
there's<00:03:32.670> buttercream<00:03:33.180> and<00:03:33.209> there<00:03:33.540> I<00:03:33.800> would

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
there's buttercream and there I would

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.070 
there's buttercream and there I would
recommend<00:03:35.459> just<00:03:35.940> putting<00:03:36.300> it<00:03:36.420> sticking<00:03:36.780> it<00:03:36.959> in

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
recommend just putting it sticking it in

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.140 
recommend just putting it sticking it in
the<00:03:37.170> fridge<00:03:37.350> first<00:03:37.680> to<00:03:38.250> make<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.490> cake<00:03:38.700> firmer

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
the fridge first to make the cake firmer

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.920 
the fridge first to make the cake firmer
more<00:03:39.390> stable<00:03:39.870> and<00:03:39.990> then<00:03:40.860> carve<00:03:41.160> it<00:03:41.280> out<00:03:41.930> crumb

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
more stable and then carve it out crumb

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.949 
more stable and then carve it out crumb
coat<00:03:43.200> it<00:03:43.350> and<00:03:43.500> stick<00:03:43.709> it<00:03:43.740> back<00:03:43.950> so<00:03:44.850> if<00:03:45.180> we<00:03:45.810> do

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
coat it and stick it back so if we do

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.680 
coat it and stick it back so if we do
the<00:03:46.110> same<00:03:46.380> to<00:03:47.010> all<00:03:47.190> of<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:47.550> cake<00:03:47.790> it's<00:03:48.000> the

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
the same to all of the cake it's the

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.080 
the same to all of the cake it's the
same<00:03:48.870> process<00:03:49.400> carving<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:50.520> bottom<00:03:50.850> I've

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
same process carving the bottom I've

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.350 
same process carving the bottom I've
been<00:03:51.330> covering<00:03:51.540> the<00:03:51.750> sides<00:03:51.990> and<00:03:52.910> also<00:03:53.910> carving

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
been covering the sides and also carving

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.960 
been covering the sides and also carving
the<00:03:54.510> top<00:03:54.720> and<00:03:55.160> slicing<00:03:56.160> it<00:03:56.280> you<00:03:56.430> would<00:03:56.580> come<00:03:56.790> up

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
the top and slicing it you would come up

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:04.100 
the top and slicing it you would come up
with<00:03:57.810> three<00:03:59.270> angled<00:04:00.270> cakes<00:04:02.630> so<00:04:03.630> one<00:04:03.870> of<00:04:03.900> the

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
with three angled cakes so one of the

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.110 
with three angled cakes so one of the
steps<00:04:04.380> are<00:04:04.770> one<00:04:05.070> of<00:04:05.190> the<00:04:05.280> ways<00:04:05.459> to<00:04:05.760> make<00:04:05.940> it

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
steps are one of the ways to make it

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.470 
steps are one of the ways to make it
it's<00:04:06.690> pretty<00:04:06.870> much<00:04:07.080> a<00:04:07.140> stagette<00:04:08.330> stack<00:04:09.330> it

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
it's pretty much a stagette stack it

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.010 
it's pretty much a stagette stack it
like<00:04:09.630> a<00:04:09.660> regular<00:04:09.870> cake<00:04:11.270> and<00:04:12.270> others<00:04:12.780> have<00:04:12.989> done

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
like a regular cake and others have done

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.510 
like a regular cake and others have done
this<00:04:13.290> very<00:04:13.410> successfully<00:04:14.250> the<00:04:15.239> only<00:04:16.520> thing

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:17.520 
this very successfully the only thing

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.240 
this very successfully the only thing
you<00:04:17.700> would<00:04:17.850> need<00:04:18.000> to<00:04:18.180> look<00:04:18.450> at<00:04:18.660> or<00:04:19.350> look<00:04:19.650> be

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
you would need to look at or look be

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.740 
you would need to look at or look be
more<00:04:20.520> cautious<00:04:20.730> about<00:04:21.090> if<00:04:21.299> you're<00:04:21.450> just<00:04:21.510> going

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
more cautious about if you're just going

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.680 
more cautious about if you're just going
to<00:04:21.810> stack<00:04:22.020> them<00:04:22.229> on<00:04:22.350> top<00:04:22.440> of<00:04:23.040> each<00:04:23.280> other<00:04:23.690> you

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
to stack them on top of each other you

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.900 
to stack them on top of each other you
would<00:04:24.840> have<00:04:24.990> to<00:04:25.050> be<00:04:25.290> very<00:04:25.440> careful<00:04:25.740> with<00:04:26.220> how

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
would have to be very careful with how

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.400 
would have to be very careful with how
your<00:04:27.240> support<00:04:27.660> system<00:04:27.810> is<00:04:28.080> going<00:04:28.200> to<00:04:28.290> look

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
your support system is going to look

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.250 
your support system is going to look
like<00:04:28.490> because<00:04:29.490> your<00:04:30.240> dowels<00:04:30.540> will<00:04:30.990> not<00:04:31.110> be

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
like because your dowels will not be

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.160 
like because your dowels will not be
even<00:04:31.970> so<00:04:32.970> if<00:04:33.060> you're<00:04:33.240> fine<00:04:33.570> with<00:04:33.810> it<00:04:33.840> and<00:04:34.080> you

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170 
even so if you're fine with it and you

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.170 
even so if you're fine with it and you
can<00:04:34.350> you're<00:04:35.040> pretty<00:04:35.340> confident<00:04:35.820> it's<00:04:36.000> not

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
can you're pretty confident it's not

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.510 
can you're pretty confident it's not
going<00:04:36.360> to<00:04:36.450> topple<00:04:37.260> over<00:04:37.560> that's<00:04:38.070> fine<00:04:38.370> that's

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
going to topple over that's fine that's

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.120 
going to topple over that's fine that's
one<00:04:38.730> way<00:04:38.850> to<00:04:38.880> do<00:04:39.060> it<00:04:39.090> I<00:04:39.390> on<00:04:40.350> the<00:04:40.410> other<00:04:40.500> hand<00:04:40.710> I'm

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
one way to do it I on the other hand I'm

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.710 
one way to do it I on the other hand I'm
always<00:04:41.580> afraid<00:04:41.820> that<00:04:42.180> things<00:04:42.360> are<00:04:42.540> going<00:04:42.630> to

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
always afraid that things are going to

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.780 
always afraid that things are going to
topple<00:04:42.990> over<00:04:43.230> so<00:04:43.800> another<00:04:44.160> way<00:04:44.400> to<00:04:44.460> do<00:04:44.610> it

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
topple over so another way to do it

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.630 
topple over so another way to do it
would<00:04:45.600> be<00:04:45.680> this<00:04:46.680> I<00:04:46.890> know<00:04:47.160> it's<00:04:47.310> going<00:04:47.430> to<00:04:47.490> look

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
would be this I know it's going to look

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.750 
would be this I know it's going to look
pretty<00:04:47.670> high<00:04:48.410> that<00:04:49.410> looks<00:04:49.620> pretty<00:04:49.830> dumb<00:04:50.130> but

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.390 

one<00:04:53.760> way<00:04:53.910> to<00:04:53.970> do<00:04:54.150> it<00:04:54.300> is<00:04:54.650> if<00:04:55.650> you<00:04:55.800> can<00:04:55.950> imagine<00:04:56.040> a

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
one way to do it is if you can imagine a

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.540 
one way to do it is if you can imagine a
cake<00:04:56.640> board<00:04:57.530> this<00:04:58.530> has<00:04:58.800> a<00:04:58.830> cake<00:04:59.100> board<00:04:59.340> on<00:04:59.430> the

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
cake board this has a cake board on the

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.360 
cake board this has a cake board on the
bottom<00:04:59.910> right<00:05:00.360> so<00:05:01.170> use<00:05:01.440> the<00:05:01.620> same<00:05:01.830> cake<00:05:02.100> board

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
bottom right so use the same cake board

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.750 
bottom right so use the same cake board
or<00:05:02.820> use<00:05:03.000> the<00:05:03.120> same<00:05:03.330> size<00:05:03.600> the<00:05:04.320> trace<00:05:04.710> on<00:05:05.010> top<00:05:05.520> of

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
or use the same size the trace on top of

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.060 
or use the same size the trace on top of
the<00:05:05.880> cake<00:05:06.090> a<00:05:06.360> hole<00:05:06.840> and<00:05:08.150> then<00:05:09.150> level<00:05:09.540> that<00:05:09.690> hole

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
the cake a hole and then level that hole

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:13.010 
the cake a hole and then level that hole
not<00:05:11.070> too<00:05:11.340> deep<00:05:11.550> like<00:05:11.610> what<00:05:12.120> I<00:05:12.150> did<00:05:12.450> in<00:05:12.600> my<00:05:12.630> cake

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
not too deep like what I did in my cake

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.990 
not too deep like what I did in my cake
not<00:05:13.260> that<00:05:13.560> deep<00:05:14.840> but<00:05:15.840> enough<00:05:16.320> so<00:05:16.830> that<00:05:16.860> part<00:05:17.760> of

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
not that deep but enough so that part of

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.580 
not that deep but enough so that part of
your<00:05:18.330> second<00:05:19.020> tier<00:05:19.320> will<00:05:19.800> sink<00:05:20.070> in<00:05:21.230> same<00:05:22.230> thing

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
your second tier will sink in same thing

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.410 
your second tier will sink in same thing
for<00:05:22.770> your<00:05:22.890> third<00:05:23.190> tier<00:05:23.550> now<00:05:24.000> the<00:05:24.060> nice<00:05:24.390> thing

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:24.420 
for your third tier now the nice thing

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.700 
for your third tier now the nice thing
about<00:05:24.720> this<00:05:25.220> it's<00:05:26.220> a<00:05:26.400> little<00:05:26.700> time<00:05:27.330> consuming

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
about this it's a little time consuming

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.920 
about this it's a little time consuming
more<00:05:28.710> tedious<00:05:29.100> to<00:05:29.280> do<00:05:29.430> but<00:05:29.760> it<00:05:30.680> will<00:05:31.680> still<00:05:32.010> be

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
more tedious to do but it will still be

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.480 
more tedious to do but it will still be
very<00:05:33.930> stable<00:05:34.260> because<00:05:34.650> you're<00:05:34.860> using<00:05:35.070> same

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
very stable because you're using same

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.210 
very stable because you're using same
size<00:05:35.760> dowels<00:05:36.090> and<00:05:36.620> technically<00:05:37.620> the<00:05:37.920> cakes

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
size dowels and technically the cakes

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.510 
size dowels and technically the cakes
are<00:05:38.460> not<00:05:39.110> sitting<00:05:40.110> on<00:05:40.290> angles<00:05:40.890> they're

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 
are not sitting on angles they're

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.630 
are not sitting on angles they're
practically<00:05:42.980> the<00:05:43.980> same<00:05:44.250> as<00:05:44.520> your

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:46.640 
practically the same as your

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.200 
practically the same as your
three-tiered<00:05:47.640> cake<00:05:48.320> they're<00:05:49.320> actually<00:05:49.650> level

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.210 
three-tiered cake they're actually level

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.930 
three-tiered cake they're actually level
if<00:05:51.210> you<00:05:51.390> can<00:05:51.570> get<00:05:52.230> a<00:05:52.280> better<00:05:53.280> grasp<00:05:53.520> on<00:05:53.760> that

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
if you can get a better grasp on that

00:05:53.940 --> 00:06:01.460 
if you can get a better grasp on that
but<00:05:54.150> they're<00:05:55.140> on<00:05:58.220> the<00:05:59.220> same<00:05:59.430> level<00:05:59.490> with<00:06:00.470> a

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
but they're on the same level with a

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.380 
but they're on the same level with a
normal<00:06:01.890> three-tiered<00:06:02.490> cake<00:06:02.580> so<00:06:02.970> if<00:06:03.060> I<00:06:03.210> were<00:06:03.330> to

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:03.390 
normal three-tiered cake so if I were to

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.250 
normal three-tiered cake so if I were to
transport<00:06:04.140> it<00:06:04.260> I<00:06:04.760> would<00:06:05.760> be<00:06:05.970> a<00:06:06.419> lot<00:06:06.930> more

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:07.260 
transport it I would be a lot more

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.170 
transport it I would be a lot more
confident<00:06:08.250> that<00:06:08.370> it's<00:06:08.520> going<00:06:08.669> to<00:06:08.730> get<00:06:08.910> there

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 
confident that it's going to get there

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.110 
confident that it's going to get there
so<00:06:09.960> on<00:06:10.200> the<00:06:10.440> outside<00:06:10.919> you<00:06:11.580> don't<00:06:11.760> have<00:06:11.910> to

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 
so on the outside you don't have to

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.950 
so on the outside you don't have to
worry<00:06:12.300> about<00:06:12.480> looks<00:06:13.290> because<00:06:13.650> it's<00:06:14.840> going<00:06:15.840> to

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
worry about looks because it's going to

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.280 
worry about looks because it's going to
look<00:06:16.110> like<00:06:16.140> a<00:06:16.910> three-tiered<00:06:17.910> cake<00:06:18.080> so<00:06:19.080> I<00:06:19.110> hope

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.290 
look like a three-tiered cake so I hope

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:22.790 
look like a three-tiered cake so I hope
that's<00:06:19.410> a<00:06:19.560> very<00:06:19.740> short<00:06:20.930> visual<00:06:21.930> it's<00:06:22.590> not<00:06:22.770> a

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 
that's a very short visual it's not a

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.920 
that's a very short visual it's not a
great<00:06:23.070> tutorial<00:06:23.490> but<00:06:23.730> it's<00:06:23.910> a<00:06:24.060> it's<00:06:24.240> a<00:06:24.750> nice

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:24.930 
great tutorial but it's a it's a nice

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:29.570 
great tutorial but it's a it's a nice
visual<00:06:25.260> to<00:06:25.770> aid<00:06:26.390> those<00:06:27.530> who<00:06:28.530> want<00:06:28.800> to<00:06:29.010> you<00:06:29.460> know

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:29.580 
visual to aid those who want to you know

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.330 
visual to aid those who want to you know
at<00:06:29.760> least<00:06:29.790> get<00:06:30.120> an<00:06:30.240> idea<00:06:30.450> on<00:06:30.510> how<00:06:30.660> to<00:06:30.690> make<00:06:30.960> it

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:31.340 
at least get an idea on how to make it

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.040 
at least get an idea on how to make it
rooms<00:06:32.340> for<00:06:32.580> improvement<00:06:33.120> for<00:06:33.300> this<00:06:33.450> cake<00:06:33.690> for

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
rooms for improvement for this cake for

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:38.740 
rooms for improvement for this cake for
me<00:06:34.230> would<00:06:35.010> be<00:06:35.039> to<00:06:35.160> make<00:06:35.430> better<00:06:37.100> measurements

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:38.750 
me would be to make better measurements

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.630 
me would be to make better measurements
to<00:06:39.170> me<00:06:39.320> I<00:06:39.350> think<00:06:39.440> the<00:06:39.770> second<00:06:40.220> chair<00:06:40.340> looks<00:06:40.550> a

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:40.640 
to me I think the second chair looks a

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.210 
to me I think the second chair looks a
little<00:06:40.790> smaller<00:06:41.240> than<00:06:41.360> the<00:06:41.660> first<00:06:42.350> and<00:06:42.680> Bella

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:43.220 
little smaller than the first and Bella

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.240 
little smaller than the first and Bella
and<00:06:43.430> the<00:06:43.460> top<00:06:44.090> tier<00:06:44.600> it's<00:06:45.380> because<00:06:45.740> I<00:06:45.830> carved

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:46.250 
and the top tier it's because I carved

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:50.050 
and the top tier it's because I carved
in<00:06:46.400> too<00:06:46.670> much<00:06:46.880> and<00:06:48.130> I<00:06:49.130> think<00:06:49.340> the<00:06:49.490> the<00:06:49.820> whole

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:50.060 
in too much and I think the the whole

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.670 
in too much and I think the the whole
got<00:06:50.330> a<00:06:50.360> little<00:06:50.570> bigger<00:06:50.780> so<00:06:50.930> when<00:06:51.230> I<00:06:51.290> put<00:06:51.500> the

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 
got a little bigger so when I put the

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.700 
got a little bigger so when I put the
second<00:06:52.070> tier<00:06:52.220> two<00:06:52.400> tiered<00:06:53.030> inside<00:06:53.960> it<00:06:54.230> kind<00:06:54.530> of

second tier two tiered inside it kind of

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.670 
second tier two tiered inside it kind of
looked<00:06:55.040> like<00:06:55.100> it<00:06:55.340> engulfed<00:06:56.000> in<00:06:56.090> a<00:06:56.210> bit<00:06:56.680> I'm
