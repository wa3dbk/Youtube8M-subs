00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.370
 Hello together again here at Colo Kerst 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:12.539
 introduce with help 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:15.299
 Sarah the five models today 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.740
 which represents the object of intuition for us today and showed what she did with the 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.520
 Setting and we get straight to the point namely to accuse 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.039
 it looks like much again or facto a flash is formally possible it is 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.769
 again many but we want this time as always Stucki will pass 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.470
 one by one and I have their XE no thing that I want to govern there today 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.230
 to the first half of the year 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.410
 up here a big one of the 50's 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.970
 Procter box so often 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.110
 it stands at about 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.469
 mm 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:46.199
 Kundert what they could 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:49.130
 which is now one meter away from zooming world 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.770
 and she does not want our head 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.960
 is photographed here with a diaphragm of who 7 1 on a 85 mm 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.040
 Fixed focal length that gives me similar photos in this portrait 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.850
 still blur image 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.519
 even if 7 is a move or 8 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.900
 relatively high in girls 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.040
 all this around it the reflectors we see here are just that 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.689
 Finisher we have first 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.959
 because I am here through photographs pattern of the imprint must be this post 

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:19.569
 and to make up for this so that little light comes from below 

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:21.590
 Handy this Klein's attorney third goal 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.609
 in the 4 the tension zebra which also should be small soft light tone who 

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:29.609
 from below and its appearance from below 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.980
 10 we wrong two silver ones for tours 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.000
 they both catch the light of this 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.830
 because big builds up 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.260
 that a bit unfair Iggesund more firmly on the model we go back and 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.780
 So he also saw you off Tigers I got much much bigger 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.070
 Light source in the courses do not come 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.600
 than just this one of the 50 because I'm in the middle of me 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.830
 this light form 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.000
 yes and that's a mistake as in the background is a gray background 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.850
 have a sad record 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.240
 and there we have a special issue 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.980
 again slide slides I would like to take a look at this 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.180
 Color foils say few slides I use quite often because within shortest time 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.180
 I can not vary my time and I work a lot with color and time 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.400
 I do not know beforehand exactly whether yellow or blue or green I would with the 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.920
 Doing so would cost me a lot more time, however 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.430
 Change the color very briefly from Zack Zack and new color and who is good at you 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.600
 Another small tip for the home we have a pool system here 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.980
 moving it is hot can approach the background to our model 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.920
 without moving the whole place for people who do not have it 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.950
 the whole flashes of Tirol 4 5 instead of many would have to move 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.039
 to move synchronously it would almost not be possible 

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:42.699
 There are differences in brightness in the background, too 

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:45.739
 Much easier if you can background with a color best there 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.769
 you can easily regulate lighter or darker 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.389
 so we start to take pictures of her 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:54.389
 and let's go 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:00.219
 Conrad II 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:09.190
 welcome back I have a very small modifications installed 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:10.729
 I had announced at the beginning 

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:13.469
 and it's not just over there on the other side 

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:16.469
 on the left so from the right 

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:18.649
 Hinnemann a small one 

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:21.439
 of 70 cm surf box 

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:24.650
 is relatively close to me, I believe that 80 centimeters are now still 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.909
 set us was 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:29.669
 one-third to two-thirds lighter aperture 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:32.779
 on the cheek, as the main act, there is still a small one 

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:33.559
 Cooling 

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:36.849
 Valkenswaard presently knows little about anything here 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.869
 they do not stand in the way eating too little for me i wave waving 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:43.569
 since you enter 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:45.679
 I change 

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:48.519
 also blue 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.519
 so he can see how fast it is 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.579
 is done 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.779
 Unterleibchen completely different to the background 

00:04:02.779 --> 00:04:05.779
 Ronny the camera 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:10.079
 Super 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:13.079
 you do not have to Mertens 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.699
 they were not 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:25.909
 OK 

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:29.719
 the Wars Damian I say goodbye to Munich as a nice day 

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:32.290
 and now again, among other things 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.290
 if we have a second demo even more of the band 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.379
 Dr 

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:43.299
 after many goals 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.870
 8th 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:56.279
 the
