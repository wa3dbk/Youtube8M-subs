00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
where you better know what that doing it

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.720 
where you better know what that doing it
back<00:01:53.740> and<00:01:54.159> then<00:01:54.640> you<00:01:54.790> just<00:01:55.030> twist<00:01:55.450> and<00:01:56.409> twist

twist<00:02:12.270> in<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.750> way<00:02:13.080> that<00:02:13.230> you<00:02:13.290> twisted<00:02:13.770> your

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
twist in the way that you twisted your

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.790 
twist in the way that you twisted your
hair<00:02:14.069> if<00:02:14.190> not<00:02:14.370> you<00:02:14.550> aren't<00:02:14.819> twisted<00:02:15.000> and<00:02:15.810> so
