82<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:16.800> i<00:01:16.830> think<00:01:16.950> i<00:01:17.280> might<00:01:17.520> just<00:01:17.580> discard<00:01:18.270> the

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
82 so i think i might just discard the

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.200 
82 so i think i might just discard the
rest<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.750> them<00:01:18.870> that<00:01:19.620> is<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.800> very<00:01:19.920> very<00:01:20.430> perfect

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
rest of them that is a very very perfect

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.000 
rest of them that is a very very perfect
that<00:01:21.480> he<00:01:21.510> gave<00:01:21.780> from<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.110> discard<00:01:22.530> value<00:01:22.860> back

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
that he gave from the discard value back

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.630 
that he gave from the discard value back
though<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.940> that<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:24.930> not<00:01:25.230> too<00:01:25.500> bad<00:01:25.800> then<00:01:26.190> a
