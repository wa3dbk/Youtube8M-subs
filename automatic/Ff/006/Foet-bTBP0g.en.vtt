00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 hello very good everyone is watching 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:06.750
 daily news' we will learn how to spend 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.960
 all your data of the games that 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.929
 we have on our phone within the 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.170
 internal memory to our micro card 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.859
 sd or external memory good simple and 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.320
 simple 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.350
 we need to be root no matter the 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.210
 Android version that we have neither the 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:29.039
 device I am using now a 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.990
 experience and I have android 4.4 point 4 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.829
 kit kat and now I'm going to show them 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:38.050
 out settings 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:41.649
 I'm going here about the phone 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.240
 and as you can see version of android 4.4 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:46.300
 point 4 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:49.700
 ok then let's go to the next 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.850
 we need the instable exposÃ© 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.740
 for that we need to be root then 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.620
 let's go to download 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.570
 and we are going to look for the following ones we are going to 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.579
 put here in the search engine 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.850
 efe 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:10.640
 although after looking or drinking we 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.640
 will leave the application that we have here 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.640
 with modules 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.160
 would be the application ence of what 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.520
 we would have to do is only 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:25.730
 activate it and restart our 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.330
 device that simple and simple 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:30.740
 well ok now we pass the next step 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.950
 after downloading the game that we 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.110
 we want to move to the micro sd 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.910
 we are going to need our browser 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.490
 favorite me in this case I will use the 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.730
 root explorer but anyone will be worth 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:47.190
 good good then 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:51.210
 I'm going to go to internal storage 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:54.360
 and I'm going to look for the android folder 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.840
 here I am on android then on baby 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:01.290
 that's where you usually save all the 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.570
 data of our games ok then 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.480
 We will sort by date and time 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.600
 I have sorted by date and finished 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:12.300
 install the plants vs cold zombies would be 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.900
 this inside this folder there is a 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.439
 point file or bb would this be 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:21.650
 this is the one that weighs 57 megabytes and is 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:24.200
 occupying extra space in our 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:27.230
 phone so we can not install 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.269
 more good apps then right now 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.370
 let's do another step I'm going to go to 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:35.530
 the settings 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:38.440
 I will go to storage 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:42.580
 and as we can see we have available 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:46.330
 only 3.94 gigabytes of memory 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:51.040
 internal of my device and within the 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:52.150
 sd card I have 57 point 81 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.130
 good 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:03:00.400
 now let's repeat the path 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:03.090
 I'm going to copy the folder then from my 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.500
 eye game to copy because if we cut it 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.830
 you can corrupt some file 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:12.430
 then we are going to copy it and now we are going 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:16.540
 to go on the other side to it 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:18.160
 directory but inside our micro 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.610
 sd 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:24.070
 in this case I would live to that beccar 1 that 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.410
 would be the micro sd now I will look for the 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:29.440
 Android folder if I do not have it I'm going to 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:34.620
 create and if I do not have the v I'm going too 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:38.069
 to create came the vb and here I'm going to paste 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:42.019
 that good folder then after 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:45.599
 that sticks all this we will return 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:49.740
 right now to the directory 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:52.530
 original that I have it in this tab 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:55.740
 here I am in the internal memory and what 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:04:00.300
 What I'm going to do is enter the folder 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:03.660
 select the file and erase the eyes 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:06.540
 delete the file nothing but the folder 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.290
 now as we can see I'm going back to 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.290
 the settings 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:17.030
 I will go to storage 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:23.630
 and now 3.96 I have more space 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:25.580
 available and I have 57.75 less space 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.320
 in the micro that means that if the 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.270
 copy to micro sd 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.460
 now let's proceed to open the game 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:35.850
 for you to see 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:38.639
 if I can open the game they realize 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:42.330
 that verifies my age to be able to enter 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:45.139
 to the game I will put that I have 19 ready 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.139
 to accept 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.830
 and right now the game is going 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.560
 open normally 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:58.340
 that is ladies and gentlemen I hope that you 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:02.820
 have liked to serve them if so 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:05.040
 I hope you like this video 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.500
 and share it with all your friends 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.670
 that do not have much internal memory in 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.670
 your device show
