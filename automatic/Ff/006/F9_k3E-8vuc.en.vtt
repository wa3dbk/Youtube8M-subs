just like what the fuck
for<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.070> most<00:02:19.250> part<00:02:19.370> of<00:02:19.550> the<00:02:19.610> weapons<00:02:19.970> are

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
for the most part of the weapons are

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.230 
for the most part of the weapons are
pretty<00:02:20.390> bad

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
pretty bad

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.880

so<00:03:20.760> when<00:03:20.880> you're<00:03:21.000> starting<00:03:21.240> a<00:03:21.600> multiplayer

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
so when you're starting a multiplayer

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.810 
so when you're starting a multiplayer
and<00:03:22.110> level<00:03:22.350> you're<00:03:23.100> given<00:03:23.370> two<00:03:23.400> options<00:03:23.760> you

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
and level you're given two options you

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.700 
and level you're given two options you
can<00:03:23.910> switch<00:03:24.180> it<00:03:24.300> after<00:03:24.630> that<00:03:24.990> you<00:03:25.200> either<00:03:25.410> pick

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.710 
can switch it after that you either pick

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:27.710 
can switch it after that you either pick
through<00:03:25.950> a<00:03:26.010> faster<00:03:26.610> class<00:03:26.850> with<00:03:27.210> less<00:03:27.450> health

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
through a faster class with less health

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.110 
through a faster class with less health
but<00:03:28.020> um<00:03:28.170> a<00:03:28.440> faster<00:03:28.950> rifle<00:03:29.340> or<00:03:29.520> a<00:03:29.760> stronger

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
but um a faster rifle or a stronger

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.060 
but um a faster rifle or a stronger
class<00:03:30.450> which<00:03:30.690> is<00:03:30.870> like<00:03:31.080> better<00:03:31.770> health

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
class which is like better health

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.180 
class which is like better health
stronger<00:03:32.670> rifle<00:03:33.030> but<00:03:33.270> less<00:03:34.160> rapid-fire<00:03:35.160> I

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
stronger rifle but less rapid-fire I

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.640 
stronger rifle but less rapid-fire I
guess<00:03:35.550> now<00:03:36.030> for<00:03:36.420> a<00:03:36.450> budget<00:03:36.690> game<00:03:37.020> I<00:03:37.260> was<00:03:37.410> quite

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
guess now for a budget game I was quite

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.260 
guess now for a budget game I was quite
surprised<00:03:38.010> on<00:03:38.220> how<00:03:38.250> fun<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:38.880> game<00:03:39.030> can

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
surprised on how fun the game can

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.030 
surprised on how fun the game can
actually<00:03:39.660> be<00:03:39.810> once<00:03:40.110> you<00:03:40.230> get<00:03:40.380> past<00:03:40.620> like<00:03:40.860> all

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
actually be once you get past like all

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.370 
actually be once you get past like all
its<00:03:41.310> flaws<00:03:41.610> like<00:03:42.000> I<00:03:42.510> like<00:03:42.720> games<00:03:42.990> like<00:03:43.260> this

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
its flaws like I like games like this

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.440 
its flaws like I like games like this
that<00:03:43.620> feature<00:03:43.830> one<00:03:44.250> aspect<00:03:44.820> of<00:03:44.970> the<00:03:45.060> military

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
that feature one aspect of the military

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.460 
that feature one aspect of the military
because<00:03:45.690> you<00:03:45.780> can<00:03:45.900> actually<00:03:46.050> do<00:03:46.320> it<00:03:46.440> right

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
because you can actually do it right

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.720 
because you can actually do it right
that<00:03:46.890> way<00:03:47.040> you<00:03:47.100> know<00:03:47.280> you<00:03:47.370> just<00:03:47.490> make<00:03:47.700> it

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
that way you know you just make it

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.150 
that way you know you just make it
really<00:03:48.030> feel<00:03:48.330> cool<00:03:48.570> and<00:03:49.440> sniper<00:03:49.770> just<00:03:50.070> seemed

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
really feel cool and sniper just seemed

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
really feel cool and sniper just seemed
like<00:03:50.190> one<00:03:50.430> of<00:03:50.490> those<00:03:50.610> games<00:03:50.790> that<00:03:50.910> you<00:03:51.030> just

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
like one of those games that you just

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.300 
like one of those games that you just
really<00:03:51.450> had<00:03:51.660> to<00:03:51.690> play<00:03:52.020> but<00:03:52.260> I<00:03:52.290> really<00:03:52.620> I<00:03:52.770> really

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
really had to play but I really I really

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.920 
really had to play but I really I really
wish<00:03:53.670> they<00:03:53.820> would've<00:03:54.060> did<00:03:54.180> a<00:03:54.210> better<00:03:54.570> job<00:03:54.690> of

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
wish they would've did a better job of

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.450 
wish they would've did a better job of
development<00:03:55.560> of<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:55.740> game<00:03:55.860> I<00:03:55.920> realized<00:03:56.370> the

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:56.460 
development of the game I realized the

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.850 
development of the game I realized the
price<00:03:56.700> tag<00:03:56.970> is<00:03:57.150> why<00:03:57.330> it's<00:03:57.600> like<00:03:57.750> this<00:03:57.810> but<00:03:58.230> when

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
price tag is why it's like this but when

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.200 
price tag is why it's like this but when
you're<00:03:58.980> looking<00:03:59.040> at<00:03:59.250> a<00:03:59.310> $60<00:03:59.790> game<00:04:00.030> you're

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:00.210 
you're looking at a $60 game you're

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.450 
you're looking at a $60 game you're
looking<00:04:00.390> at<00:04:00.480> a<00:04:00.510> $40<00:04:00.960> game<00:04:01.310> you<00:04:02.310> know<00:04:02.430> you

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:02.460 
looking at a $40 game you know you

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.000 
looking at a $40 game you know you
realize<00:04:03.240> the<00:04:03.420> $6<00:04:03.810> game<00:04:04.050> is<00:04:04.260> that<00:04:04.380> price<00:04:04.680> just

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
realize the $6 game is that price just

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.310 
realize the $6 game is that price just
because<00:04:05.210> well<00:04:06.210> it's<00:04:06.420> gonna<00:04:06.600> be<00:04:06.780> better<00:04:06.960> the

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
because well it's gonna be better the

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.540 
because well it's gonna be better the
graphic<00:04:07.680> is<00:04:07.740> gonna<00:04:07.890> be<00:04:08.010> better<00:04:08.190> and<00:04:08.310> then

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
graphic is gonna be better and then

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.030 
graphic is gonna be better and then
that's<00:04:08.700> not<00:04:08.880> always<00:04:09.180> the<00:04:09.660> case<00:04:09.690> but<00:04:09.900> I<00:04:10.470> really

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
that's not always the case but I really

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.290 
that's not always the case but I really
feel<00:04:11.220> that<00:04:11.250> sniper<00:04:11.730> could<00:04:12.060> have<00:04:12.150> been<00:04:12.270> a

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
feel that sniper could have been a

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.060 
feel that sniper could have been a
badass<00:04:12.810> game<00:04:13.140> in<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:13.350> hands<00:04:13.680> of<00:04:13.770> a<00:04:13.860> better

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
badass game in the hands of a better

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.060 
badass game in the hands of a better
developer<00:04:14.610> as<00:04:14.760> for<00:04:15.210> rent<00:04:15.480> or<00:04:15.690> buy<00:04:15.960> it's<00:04:16.770> really

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
developer as for rent or buy it's really

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.860 
developer as for rent or buy it's really
worth<00:04:17.250> it<00:04:17.430> because<00:04:17.580> the<00:04:18.030> of<00:04:18.239> the<00:04:18.420> low<00:04:18.570> price

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
worth it because the of the low price

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.960 
worth it because the of the low price
tag<00:04:19.170> it<00:04:19.350> being<00:04:19.590> only<00:04:19.799> 40<00:04:20.160> bucks<00:04:20.310> and<00:04:20.549> there's

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
tag it being only 40 bucks and there's

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.910 
tag it being only 40 bucks and there's
definitely<00:04:21.120> some<00:04:21.510> fun<00:04:21.720> to<00:04:21.840> be<00:04:21.930> had<00:04:22.170> but<00:04:22.680> if<00:04:22.770> you

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:22.920 
definitely some fun to be had but if you

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.190 
definitely some fun to be had but if you
are<00:04:23.160> one<00:04:23.490> of<00:04:23.580> those<00:04:23.670> gamers<00:04:24.090> who's<00:04:24.270> real<00:04:24.720> picky

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
are one of those gamers who's real picky

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.890 
are one of those gamers who's real picky
when<00:04:25.320> it<00:04:25.380> comes<00:04:25.500> to<00:04:25.800> graphics<00:04:26.250> and<00:04:26.400> such<00:04:26.550> I

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
when it comes to graphics and such I

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.890 
when it comes to graphics and such I
recommend<00:04:27.900> not<00:04:27.960> even<00:04:28.290> thinking<00:04:28.620> about<00:04:28.680> it
