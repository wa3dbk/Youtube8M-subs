but<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.590> reason<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:34.920> say<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.190> use<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:35.700> this

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
but the reason I say to use it is this

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.530 
but the reason I say to use it is this
is<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.120> wet<00:00:36.420> multi-disc<00:00:36.960> clutch<00:00:37.940> nor<00:00:38.940> modern

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
is a wet multi-disc clutch nor modern

so<00:00:44.399> it's<00:00:45.120> going<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.360> be<00:00:45.539> just<00:00:46.050> having<00:00:46.200> a

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
so it's going to be just having a

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.139 
so it's going to be just having a
straight<00:00:46.829> old<00:00:46.950> ten<00:00:47.219> weight<00:00:47.430> motor<00:00:47.700> oil<00:00:47.940> in

there<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.510> really<00:00:48.539> does<00:00:48.930> not<00:00:49.079> have

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
there that really does not have

parts<00:00:54.090> last<00:00:54.449> longer<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.170> clearly<00:00:55.620> if<00:00:55.739> you're

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
parts last longer and clearly if you're

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.319 
parts last longer and clearly if you're
investing<00:00:56.309> all<00:00:56.430> this<00:00:56.579> money<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:57.000> your<00:00:57.120> clutch

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
investing all this money in your clutch

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.520 
investing all this money in your clutch
you<00:00:57.510> want<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.719> make<00:00:57.870> sure<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.109> lasts<00:00:58.320> as<00:00:58.500> long

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
you want to make sure it lasts as long

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.700 
you want to make sure it lasts as long
as<00:00:58.800> we<00:00:58.920> can<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.840> what<00:01:00.840> we<00:01:00.960> did<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.289> we<00:01:01.320> actually

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
as we can so what we did is we actually

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.289 
as we can so what we did is we actually
feel<00:01:02.219> fill<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.879> oil<00:01:03.120> until<00:01:03.830> the<00:01:04.830> oil<00:01:05.460> runs<00:01:06.030> out

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
feel fill the oil until the oil runs out

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.010

the<00:01:06.510> fill<00:01:06.750> oil<00:01:07.470> level<00:01:07.799> fill<00:01:08.250> plug<00:01:08.720> it's<00:01:09.720> just<00:01:09.930> a

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
the fill oil level fill plug it's just a

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.800 
the fill oil level fill plug it's just a
little<00:01:10.310> 3/8<00:01:11.310> bolt<00:01:11.640> with<00:01:11.909> aluminum<00:01:12.360> washer<00:01:12.659> on

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
little 3/8 bolt with aluminum washer on

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.560 
little 3/8 bolt with aluminum washer on
it<00:01:12.990> it'll<00:01:13.260> says<00:01:13.500> oil<00:01:13.799> level<00:01:14.220> next<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.760> and

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
it it'll says oil level next to it and

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.690 
it it'll says oil level next to it and
once<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.930> runs<00:01:16.080> out<00:01:16.350> then<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.189> can<00:01:17.369> replace

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
once it runs out then you can replace

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.240 
once it runs out then you can replace
that<00:01:18.020> be<00:01:19.020> sure<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.320> tighten<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.770> if<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.009> don't

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
that be sure to tighten it if you don't

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.719 
that be sure to tighten it if you don't
it<00:01:20.430> will<00:01:20.580> surely<00:01:21.180> leak<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.600> little<00:01:21.720> oil<00:01:22.049> and

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
it will surely leak a little oil and

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.190 
it will surely leak a little oil and
make<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.850> nice<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.360> messy<00:01:24.540> all<00:01:24.840> over<00:01:25.049> your
