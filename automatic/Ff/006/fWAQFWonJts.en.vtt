seconds<00:00:42.030> Busbee<00:00:42.329> has<00:00:42.450> beside<00:00:42.930> Kimi<00:00:43.230> again

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
seconds Busbee has beside Kimi again

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.049 
seconds Busbee has beside Kimi again
well<00:00:43.800> he<00:00:43.920> was<00:00:44.070> on<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.280> outside<00:00:44.550> line<00:00:44.760> so<00:00:45.000> he

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
well he was on the outside line so he

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.790 
well he was on the outside line so he
had<00:00:45.210> no<00:00:45.390> other<00:00:45.480> chance<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:46.020> just<00:00:46.230> cutting<00:00:46.649> it

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
had no other chance to just cutting it

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.760 
had no other chance to just cutting it
so<00:00:47.309> basically<00:00:47.820> he<00:00:48.329> just<00:00:48.719> had<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.989> go<00:00:49.110> out<00:00:49.260> so<00:00:49.620> if

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
so basically he just had to go out so if

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.500 
so basically he just had to go out so if
we<00:00:49.950> put<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.129> wall<00:00:50.430> next<00:00:50.789> time<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.210> will<00:00:51.329> break

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
feeling you know especially because who

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.390 
feeling you know especially because who
have<00:01:18.659> rules<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.290> sports<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.830> we<00:01:20.130> need<00:01:20.280> to

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
have rules in the sports and we need to

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.679 
have rules in the sports and we need to
follow<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.759> rules<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:21.119> know<00:01:21.210> if<00:01:21.360> somebody

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
follow the rules you know if somebody

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.899 
follow the rules you know if somebody
doesn't<00:01:21.900> follow<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.200> rules<00:01:22.549> that's<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.700> I

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
doesn't follow the rules that's it I

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.789 
doesn't follow the rules that's it I
think<00:01:24.450> I'd<00:01:24.810> feel<00:01:24.840> uncomfortable<00:01:25.020> with<00:01:25.770> that

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
think I'd feel uncomfortable with that

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.539 
think I'd feel uncomfortable with that
decision<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:27.560> but<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.590> think<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:29.009> significant

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
decision and but I think the significant

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.399 
decision and but I think the significant
thing<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.150> Louis<00:01:30.479> repast<00:01:30.960> him<00:01:31.170> because

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
thing is that Louis repast him because

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.780 
thing is that Louis repast him because
he<00:01:31.500> was<00:01:31.619> so<00:01:31.770> much<00:01:31.979> faster<00:01:32.220> he<00:01:32.490> was<00:01:32.579> catching

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
he was so much faster he was catching

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.670 
he was so much faster he was catching
him<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.329> started<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.780> rain<00:01:33.930> he<00:01:34.229> had<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.380> much

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
him it started to rain he had a much

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.100 
him it started to rain he had a much

concern<00:01:58.829> I<00:01:58.860> think<00:01:58.979> within<00:01:59.310> 24<00:01:59.969> hours<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.420> the

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
judgement coming out we had 3,000 emails

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.219 
judgement coming out we had 3,000 emails
and<00:02:04.939> 97%<00:02:05.939> of<00:02:06.000> them<00:02:06.119> said<00:02:06.329> we're<00:02:06.930> never<00:02:07.020> going

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
to watch Formula One again so England is

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.839 
to watch Formula One again so England is
not<00:02:10.229> terribly<00:02:10.560> happy<00:02:10.709> but<00:02:11.129> I<00:02:11.160> get<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.640> sense

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
not terribly happy but I get a sense

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.500 
not terribly happy but I get a sense
that<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.060> rest<00:02:12.209> of

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
that the rest of

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.270 
that the rest of
terribly<00:02:12.930> happy<00:02:13.170> either<00:02:13.260> and<00:02:13.500> I<00:02:13.620> think<00:02:14.040> it<00:02:14.159> was

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
terribly happy either and I think it was

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.789 
terribly happy either and I think it was
a<00:02:14.310> completely<00:02:15.060> erroneous<00:02:15.659> decision<00:02:16.500> I<00:02:16.620> think

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
a completely erroneous decision I think

a completely erroneous decision I think
it<00:02:16.860> was<00:02:16.950> a<00:02:16.980> big<00:02:17.280> mistake<00:02:17.489> by<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.439> governing
