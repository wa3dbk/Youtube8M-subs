00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.929
 Hello to you and Lech 4w today 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.720
 our own lightning tactics 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.670
 which is only suitable for the sole 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.619
 cards is an imbalance on i card under 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.890
 named robin and let's see 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.420
 what is this imbalance on i tactic 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.570
 so we start the fight as you see threw 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.520
 we are pretty good to level nine i 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.829
 on t-54 with. 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.480
 it is very good that is dynamics to us 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.239
 will allow to occupy 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.640
 precisely advantageous position to advance 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.280
 further lightning tactics for this and 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.039
 so beckoning lightning tactics 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.110
 is that we are above water 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.739
 This is the path for the move. 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.660
 just cube pushing under the side 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.850
 the adversary that is we rise and 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.489
 highlighted by absolutely everyone as you can see 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.770
 top -grade skins are illuminated, that is, 9 8 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.449
 level serious enough nursery rhymes and 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.489
 look here and considering what 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.450
 the greatest amount of our strength 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.659
 left on base 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.840
 of course already endure all instantly 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.460
 these trunks i.e. and drying absolutely 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.720
 did not have time to do in the hangar 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.000
 went further pvc 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.610
 waffentur ninth level is also nothing 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.439
 failed to make 704 rolls back 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.570
 but he doesn't have much chance either 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.150
 do something and how you see so 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.670
 in time, the allied tanks begin 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.369
 huge dpm just take it all 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.710
 enemy tanks i.e. tanks 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.409
 the enemy did not have time to drive off from the base and 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.729
 theirs is the most fundamental problem is that 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.700
 as you can see, I just stupid them 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.340
 highlighting and allied tanks of course 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.420
 fires back at them is lightning 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.689
 victory tactics considering the fact that even if 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.329
 from the enemy very quickly 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.090
 go down and tie it also will not 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.430
 from such a serious boost but because 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.920
 anyway, even if the tanks go down 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.160
 opponents under the square to 3 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.740
 anyway there flashes them and if there is 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.350
 artillery then break them 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.180
 but do not forget that if you have 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.190
 enemy teams also artillery then 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.770
 Of course you too can very easily 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.410
 aim because there is one such 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.540
 stone for which you can hide in 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.030
 principle artillery will not be so much 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.100
 you will be bored as ours will bother 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.570
 artillery tanks of the enemy that is 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.780
 to be honest 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:35.600
 upper rest ie without cowsheds 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.800
 much more imbalance given then 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.810
 what simply if there is a big 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.580
 small from aas speak dynamic and 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.160
 st-scale or some kind of dynamic 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.680
 heavy tank is also suitable l. 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.960
 here, though suitable but not so much 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.760
 how after all some serious so 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.650
 because if it blows up here 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.570
 any bird that you can 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.350
 do that is you can only 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.900
 highlight 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.760
 if any tank falls on you 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.880
 adversary if 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.160
 Needless to say the allies will miss 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.050
 any tank then you already unfortunately 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.000
 you can not play anything serious 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.950
 do it because you just 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.950
 right here in this pocket 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:19.190
 that's where now i'm not here 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.870
 gets tanks allied tanks do not get 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:25.180
 and you absolutely do not cover 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:27.530
 but as you can see here drives up from 6 and 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.630
 immediately 700 grabs on 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.580
 half hp he grab nothing he 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.320
 can make i take advantage of the moment 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.470
 Of course you need to sell it and 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:39.700
 look he has 400 hp yes he 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.960
 Rashid He Rashid me look I 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.420
 be sure to leave it to the tracks then 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:47.450
 there is benefit in that when 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.030
 you are going to the enemy then he seems to be on top 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.860
 down you won't be able to expose 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.170
 and you can do it from the bottom up 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.910
 shoot him on the tracks and it will 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.460
 extremely profitable due to the fact that he 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.800
 he will not be able to stop very quickly 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.050
 take advantage of the turnip and of course in 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.080
 this moment he will go to the hangar because 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:08.300
 that allied tanks mean it 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.459
 undressed bennet that is like in the form of one 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.990
 flank i mean this game is one flank 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.630
 absolutely not so much now 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:17.750
 Robin became popular on the map 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:20.180
 it is a hill that is the 9 0 line because 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.160
 that everything is on the first-second line of the rashad 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.300
 and of course it gives its main 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:28.280
 Profit even very often happens such that 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.110
 if a platoon of some heavy tanks 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.470
 there are such heavy tanks like example of 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.270
 7 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:36.199
 who have pretty good dynamics then 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:38.509
 same t110 e5 if they are platooned then 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:40.940
 they can easily and even from the bottom 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:43.720
 respa that is cut across the barns boldly 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:47.330
 can about rashit so move and 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.759
 of course already huddle under the square h1 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:53.120
 and there, of course, also highlight the tanks 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:56.090
 opponents and allied tanks will be on them 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.759
 certainly nothing homely 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:01.970
 can you do the developers though 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:04.310
 removed the so-called stood because 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.990
 very often before that 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.220
 robin was standing because 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:11.449
 who takes the slide 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:14.360
 that result of course is king but they 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:16.389
 did not take into account the fact that very quickly and screeds and 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:21.699
 even some heavy 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:24.710
 can still here and so drive through 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:27.979
 this move and highlight of course 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:31.010
 all forest opponents here of course I 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:33.349
 merged due to not turning 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:35.060
 serious attention to artillery then 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:39.699
 there is as in the form remained vanshotny 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:42.680
 Jagdtigr 88 but here I was overtaken 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:44.690
 brown bark artillery peppered me 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.330
 with clothes even though he was alone 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:50.150
 pretty substantial but nothing all 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:52.580
 equal by the results of the battle you will see 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.289
 how much I could do for that 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.830
 the moment I lived, that is, I lived 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:59.360
 five minutes and honestly it is already a victory 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.430
 one hundred percent because our tanks 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.770
 much more is left and they 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:07.280
 already rushit in all directions absolutely 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:09.949
 that is, itâ€™s a 100% win very much 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.620
 very effective tactic very much 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:15.949
 profit she brings and countermeasures of this 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:18.169
 current tactics of course if some 

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:20.780
 the same speed st or some 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:21.849
 speed of course also goes according to 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:26.300
 to this 

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:28.729
 move and bump into himself 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:31.099
 counter rush that is so called 

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:33.970
 meetings rush only saves from this 

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:37.759
 tactics of course can merge 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:39.830
 both tanks can merge ie tank with 

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:42.470
 upper spawn and tank from lower spawn 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:44.569
 but there will be no opportunity to drive 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:47.930
 it is here in this pocket of it 

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:50.389
 highlight the entire risk of opponents then 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:53.090
 there is basically everyone doing now how 

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:54.860
 they instantly leave with very quickly 

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:57.080
 bases that is if the card is raspberry in which 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:59.750
 here the word mailer is not even a drop 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:01.669
 and just go away leave again 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:05.300
 only such an option can leave 

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:08.509
 I hope to save you from inevitable death 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:11.120
 you like this tactic she already liked 

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:12.860
 enjoyed a very very long time but 

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.169
 anyway, I wanted to show you exactly 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:17.120
 that i'm not so much nadamajil but by 

00:07:15.169 --> 00:07:18.860
 the results you will see how much I 

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:22.940
 nevertheless I have enlightened with the help of me 

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:25.669
 of course caused damage immediately go away 

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:27.740
 go ahead and say that even though I merged but 

00:07:25.669 --> 00:07:30.139
 anyway i got a badge of class 

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:33.319
 master, but only for highlighting 

00:07:30.139 --> 00:07:35.120
 and pretty seriously highlight on this and 

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:37.729
 For today, the video ends it 

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.349
 It turned out very short but if 

00:07:37.729 --> 00:07:40.789

 now we go the way of the ascendant 

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:55.310
 sun so to speak and deflate 

00:07:51.849 --> 00:07:57.529
