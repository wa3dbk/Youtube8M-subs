00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:20.660
 rungs and between cup and glass I made myself 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:26.470

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:00.120
 clandestine 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.550
 I learned to be quiet 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.379

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.909

 Gentle until tomorrow 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:24.880

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:27.359

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.470
 a little bit in love 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.280
 Well, good soldier wife 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.940
 the 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.980
 Y 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.650
 for all the verses we use the 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.340
 thumb g arpeggio 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:02.340
 index 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.620
 cancel and a half at the same time again 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:09.850
 index and a half 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:12.330
 annular and middle index and we ended up with 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.330
 index 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.680
 Y 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.030
 ah 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.120
 for the remembered of my seventh we are not going to 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.980
 put the full chord but only 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.990
 we're going to step on the ropes we're going 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.410
 to use in this case in the first three 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:39.050
 strings we only tread the third in the 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:42.340
 first fret and the bass we're going to 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.340
 put in sustained sun 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.610
 and the other fingers but they say to the air 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.600
 then this chord comes only diminished 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:04.549
 then comes the greater re but with low in 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:04.549
 F sharp then we put like this 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.260
 then comes re minor but with low in 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.260
 fa 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.489
 then the minor and my greatest 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.409
 and why do we make so many variations of 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.840
 the chords because we have a bass 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:27.990
 chromatic descending that goes from the to 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:32.570
 sustained 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:32.570
 Sustained sun 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.430
 fifa 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.750
 such 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.390
 Y 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.960
 Y 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.960
 the 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:53.710
 and in the choir part we're going to use the 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:56.640
 strum number 10 thumb down 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:59.700
 another thumb down 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.959
 three fingers work 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.959
 and thumb work 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.040
