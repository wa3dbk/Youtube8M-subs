00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.839 
one of the Mahler
once<00:02:09.659> and<00:02:09.929> he<00:02:10.110> promised<00:02:10.530> me<00:02:10.649> years<00:02:10.920> back<00:02:11.190> that

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
once and he promised me years back that

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.520 
once and he promised me years back that
we<00:02:12.330> would<00:02:12.450> be<00:02:12.569> working<00:02:12.900> together<00:02:13.080> on

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
we would be working together on

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.300 
we would be working together on
something<00:02:13.830> you<00:02:14.250> know<00:02:14.299> original<00:02:15.299> so<00:02:16.310> and

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
something you know original so and

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.800 
something you know original so and
something<00:02:17.610> different<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:18.209> I<00:02:18.299> think<00:02:18.360> he's

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
something different and I think he's

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.979 
something different and I think he's
proved<00:02:19.140> that<00:02:19.400> on<00:02:20.400> his<00:02:20.700> most<00:02:21.150> recent<00:02:21.390> album

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
proved that on his most recent album

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.399 
proved that on his most recent album
called<00:02:22.500> for<00:02:22.739> the<00:02:22.860> music<00:02:23.220> which<00:02:24.019> also<00:02:25.019> has

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
called for the music which also has

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:28.009 
called for the music which also has
Chinese<00:02:25.920> sing<00:02:26.220> on<00:02:26.430> the<00:02:26.549> album<00:02:26.580> it<00:02:27.000> has<00:02:27.030> Apache

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
Chinese sing on the album it has Apache

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:31.280 
Chinese sing on the album it has Apache
Indian<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:28.680> myself<00:02:29.430> being<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.150> only<00:02:30.299> female

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
Indian and myself being the only female

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.930 
Indian and myself being the only female
vocalist<00:02:31.799> on<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.010> album<00:02:32.430> so<00:02:32.610> I<00:02:32.640> think<00:02:32.730> he's

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
vocalist on the album so I think he's

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.150 
vocalist on the album so I think he's
doing<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.299> grand<00:02:33.599> job<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:34.319> track<00:02:34.620> that<00:02:35.129> I
