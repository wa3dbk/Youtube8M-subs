sometimes<00:01:26.540> do<00:01:26.930> this<00:01:27.110> the<00:01:27.259> night<00:01:27.410> before<00:01:27.440> cover

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
sometimes do this the night before cover

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.889 
sometimes do this the night before cover
it<00:01:28.369> loosely<00:01:28.520> and<00:01:28.970> let<00:01:29.119> the<00:01:29.210> bread<00:01:29.420> go<00:01:29.570> stale<00:01:29.869> a

seems too dry you can add a bit more
liquid<00:03:26.750> but<00:03:27.380> it<00:03:27.500> should<00:03:27.680> be<00:03:27.830> a<00:03:27.860> firm<00:03:28.310> dough

once the dough is mixed place it on a
clean<00:03:31.520> flat<00:03:31.880> surface<00:03:32.450> and<00:03:32.630> knead<00:03:32.930> it<00:03:32.990> at<00:03:33.620> first

clean flat surface and knead it at first

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.530 
clean flat surface and knead it at first
this<00:03:34.340> helps<00:03:34.610> to<00:03:34.760> mix<00:03:34.970> it<00:03:35.090> more<00:03:35.270> thoroughly

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
this helps to mix it more thoroughly

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.290 
this helps to mix it more thoroughly
once<00:03:36.290> it<00:03:36.440> is<00:03:36.470> uniformly<00:03:37.070> mixed<00:03:37.340> however<00:03:37.730> the

once it is uniformly mixed however the
kneading<00:03:38.660> helps<00:03:38.930> to<00:03:39.050> develop<00:03:39.200> long<00:03:39.680> gluten

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
kneading helps to develop long gluten

kneading helps to develop long gluten
strands<00:03:40.600> this<00:03:41.600> will<00:03:41.840> give<00:03:41.990> the<00:03:42.110> roast<00:03:42.320> a

better texture I generally knead this

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.360 
better texture I generally knead this
dough<00:03:44.720> the<00:03:45.110> same<00:03:45.350> way<00:03:45.530> I<00:03:45.560> need<00:03:45.890> bread<00:03:46.160> dough

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
dough the same way I need bread dough

dough the same way I need bread dough
you<00:03:46.880> shouldn't<00:03:47.210> need<00:03:47.360> to<00:03:47.510> put<00:03:47.690> down<00:03:47.720> flour<00:03:48.140> for

you shouldn't need to put down flour for

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.020 
you shouldn't need to put down flour for
this<00:03:48.530> as<00:03:48.800> the<00:03:49.010> dough<00:03:49.160> will<00:03:49.310> stick<00:03:49.520> to<00:03:49.670> itself

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
this as the dough will stick to itself

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.780 
this as the dough will stick to itself
but<00:03:50.360> it<00:03:50.480> shouldn't<00:03:50.780> stick<00:03:50.960> to<00:03:51.140> the<00:03:51.260> surface

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
but it shouldn't stick to the surface

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.460 
but it shouldn't stick to the surface
after<00:03:52.790> a<00:03:53.120> few<00:03:53.390> minutes<00:03:53.690> of<00:03:53.780> kneading<00:03:53.960> the

after a few minutes of kneading the

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.500 
after a few minutes of kneading the
texture<00:03:54.860> will<00:03:54.980> become<00:03:55.280> uniform<00:03:55.850> and<00:03:56.090> like

aside<00:03:59.360> for<00:03:59.840> a<00:03:59.870> few<00:03:59.930> minutes<00:04:00.410> to<00:04:00.590> let<00:04:00.740> it<00:04:00.860> rest

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
aside for a few minutes to let it rest

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.420 
aside for a few minutes to let it rest
then<00:04:02.150> get<00:04:02.630> out<00:04:02.750> a<00:04:02.780> rolling<00:04:03.140> pin<00:04:03.320> rolling<00:04:04.280> out

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430

then get out a rolling pin rolling out
this<00:04:04.580> dough<00:04:04.820> will<00:04:05.030> be<00:04:05.150> quite<00:04:05.420> difficult<00:04:05.720> and<00:04:06.230> I

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
this dough will be quite difficult and I

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.930 
this dough will be quite difficult and I
usually<00:04:06.680> have<00:04:07.040> to<00:04:07.250> roll<00:04:07.400> it<00:04:07.430> out<00:04:07.610> about

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
usually have to roll it out about

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.970 
usually have to roll it out about
halfway<00:04:08.240> let<00:04:09.050> it<00:04:09.170> rest<00:04:09.320> for<00:04:09.560> a<00:04:09.590> few<00:04:09.650> more

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
halfway let it rest for a few more

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.010 
halfway let it rest for a few more
minutes<00:04:10.130> and<00:04:10.460> then<00:04:11.090> roll<00:04:11.330> it<00:04:11.450> out<00:04:11.540> the<00:04:11.690> rest<00:04:11.840> of

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
minutes and then roll it out the rest of

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.800 
minutes and then roll it out the rest of
the<00:04:12.140> way<00:04:12.490> this<00:04:13.490> helps<00:04:13.730> because<00:04:14.030> as<00:04:14.480> the<00:04:14.660> dough

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
the way this helps because as the dough

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.870 
the way this helps because as the dough
rests<00:04:15.260> the<00:04:15.440> gluten<00:04:15.740> relaxes<00:04:16.280> and<00:04:16.580> that<00:04:16.760> will

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
rests the gluten relaxes and that will

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.750 
rests the gluten relaxes and that will
make<00:04:17.030> it<00:04:17.090> easier<00:04:17.540> to<00:04:17.630> stretch<00:04:18.020> and<00:04:18.320> roll<00:04:18.590> out

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
make it easier to stretch and roll out

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.010 
make it easier to stretch and roll out
you'll<00:04:19.760> probably<00:04:19.820> want<00:04:20.480> to<00:04:20.570> roll<00:04:20.750> it<00:04:20.780> from

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:21.020 
you'll probably want to roll it from

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:23.230 
you'll probably want to roll it from
side<00:04:21.290> to<00:04:21.350> side<00:04:21.590> as<00:04:22.070> well<00:04:22.310> as<00:04:22.550> this<00:04:22.880> will<00:04:23.060> keep

the celery and the mushrooms especially

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.350 
the celery and the mushrooms especially
will<00:05:00.920> help<00:05:01.130> to<00:05:01.280> keep<00:05:01.430> the<00:05:01.610> stuffing<00:05:02.060> and<00:05:02.210> the
