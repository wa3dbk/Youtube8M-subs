00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:16.059
 only youtube we are going with another 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.390
 tuto if here is collaborating with me 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.090
 and then start how to reset or 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.640
 format your 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.850
 [Music] 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:29.180
 device device on your ipod ipod 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:31.810
 iphone whatever you want then there is a 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:37.610
 difference between formatting and resetting 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:39.590
 format and it's reset the factory 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.390
 or remove the operating system also 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.420
 you could but we're going to do the 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.570
 simple formatting to leave it zeros 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.660
 or there is also the reset that with the 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.810
 reset only 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:56.610
 is a common springboard recipe for 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:59.940
 be applications failing or something like that 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.460
 then we go 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.190
 then you have to go to the next 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.600
 route let's go to settings 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.600
 let's go to general 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.990
 and in general 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.799
 let's go to reset 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.299
 then here you can give 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:22.460
 reset settings delete content 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:25.720
 settings reset 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.619
 also the network the keyboard 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.409
 reset home screen is 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.299
 reset locate if you give in 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.370
 reset adjustments you will ask for a 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:37.430
 code 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:40.010
 the one that you already put him or if not 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.530
 you have put code for it will not tell you if 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.210
 I'll put that on my iPhone 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.760
 obviously I will not do it 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.750
 that I would erase absolutely everything 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.200
 but if you want then 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:54.680
 reset settings or delete contents 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.570
 and adjustments that are this if you erase 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.450
 totally everything 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.300
 ok that's for the side of the form 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.150
 to reset the iphone you just have to 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.729
 press the home button and the bot and the 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.910
 button to block at the same time the 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:15.050
 you keep oppressed for about ten 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:17.080
 seconds I think it is and it's going to turn off the 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.480
 device 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:24.220
 this serves in case there were applications 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:27.220
 blocked or not loaded there is no certain 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:30.680
 ship in the system then with this 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.480
 You can fix it by giving it this recipe 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.250
 and automatically it is resisting 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.680
 salt the manzanita and start again 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:40.730
 the common operating system 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:45.080
 do not erase anything just reset 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.370
 in case there is a book or something and here 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.110
 is the operating system again 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.440
 functioning normally with all its 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.360
 applications and all good friends friends 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.510

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.510
