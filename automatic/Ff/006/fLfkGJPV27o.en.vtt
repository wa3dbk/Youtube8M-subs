00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:25.840 
because it's actually a natural fiber

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.290 
because it's actually a natural fiber
from<00:00:26.230> the<00:00:26.350> flax<00:00:26.619> plant<00:00:26.890> that<00:00:27.850> was<00:00:28.119> very

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
from the flax plant that was very

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.900 
from the flax plant that was very
popular<00:00:28.900> in<00:00:28.930> ancient<00:00:29.289> Egypt<00:00:29.980> basically<00:00:30.789> the

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
popular in ancient Egypt basically the

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.580 
popular in ancient Egypt basically the
rich<00:00:31.119> people<00:00:31.600> were<00:00:31.779> the<00:00:31.900> people<00:00:32.140> who<00:00:32.259> own<00:00:32.410> the

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590 
rich people were the people who own the

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.619 
rich people were the people who own the
linen<00:00:32.890> because<00:00:33.280> it<00:00:33.579> was<00:00:33.699> very<00:00:33.910> expensive<00:00:34.239> to

00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:34.629 
linen because it was very expensive to

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:37.439 
linen because it was very expensive to
make<00:00:34.899> time<00:00:35.319> consuming<00:00:35.979> and<00:00:36.300> they<00:00:37.300> even

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:37.449 
make time consuming and they even

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:39.360 
make time consuming and they even
wrapped<00:00:37.749> their<00:00:37.929> mummies<00:00:38.229> in<00:00:38.260> it<00:00:38.530> and<00:00:38.679> used<00:00:39.219> it

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
wrapped their mummies in it and used it

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.700 
wrapped their mummies in it and used it
as<00:00:39.519> currency<00:00:39.969> so<00:00:40.780> not<00:00:41.079> the<00:00:41.170> mummies<00:00:41.440> but<00:00:41.620> the

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
as currency so not the mummies but the

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.610 
as currency so not the mummies but the
linen<00:00:41.979> so<00:00:42.550> it's<00:00:42.969> a<00:00:43.210> kind<00:00:44.199> of<00:00:44.319> one<00:00:44.499> of<00:00:44.530> those

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
linen so it's a kind of one of those

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.549 
linen so it's a kind of one of those
expensive<00:00:45.399> luxury<00:00:45.940> fibers<00:00:46.479> that<00:00:47.019> I<00:00:47.079> wanted<00:00:47.440> to

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
it doesn't really have that feeling that

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.650 
it doesn't really have that feeling that
I<00:02:50.790> like<00:02:51.060> preferably<00:02:51.810> which<00:02:52.470> is<00:02:52.740> more<00:02:53.100> of<00:02:53.250> a

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
I like preferably which is more of a

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.820 
I like preferably which is more of a
soft<00:02:54.660> go<00:02:55.320> around<00:02:55.530> my<00:02:55.650> curves<00:02:55.950> type<00:02:56.130> of<00:02:56.280> look<00:02:56.600> I

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
soft go around my curves type of look I

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.540 
soft go around my curves type of look I
would<00:02:58.830> probably<00:02:58.980> say<00:02:59.340> no<00:02:59.550> even<00:03:00.450> though<00:03:00.810> I<00:03:01.550> like

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
would probably say no even though I like

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.870 
would probably say no even though I like
the<00:03:02.850> idea<00:03:03.030> of<00:03:03.830> wearing<00:03:04.830> a<00:03:05.130> natural<00:03:05.640> fibre

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
the idea of wearing a natural fibre

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.250 
the idea of wearing a natural fibre
linen<00:03:06.030> I<00:03:06.860> don't<00:03:07.860> like<00:03:08.250> the<00:03:08.520> way<00:03:08.550> it<00:03:08.790> feels<00:03:08.820> in<00:03:09.510> I

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
linen I don't like the way it feels in I

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.740 
linen I don't like the way it feels in I
think<00:03:10.680> color<00:03:11.370> wise<00:03:11.670> I<00:03:12.000> prefer<00:03:12.450> to<00:03:12.600> have

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
think color wise I prefer to have

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.040 
think color wise I prefer to have
something<00:03:13.170> that<00:03:13.320> was<00:03:13.440> a<00:03:13.470> little<00:03:13.560> more<00:03:13.980> on<00:03:14.280> the

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
something that was a little more on the

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.020 
something that was a little more on the
blue<00:03:16.050> red<00:03:16.290> as<00:03:16.560> opposed<00:03:17.100> to<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.459> orange<00:03:17.760> red

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
blue red as opposed to the orange red

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.830 
blue red as opposed to the orange red
and<00:03:18.500> so<00:03:19.550> that's<00:03:20.550> my<00:03:20.850> that's<00:03:21.209> my<00:03:21.570> final

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
and so that's my that's my final

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.780 
and so that's my that's my final
decision<00:03:22.260> but<00:03:22.650> what<00:03:22.769> about<00:03:22.800> you<00:03:23.160> would<00:03:23.610> you

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
decision but what about you would you

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.720 
decision but what about you would you
wear<00:03:24.030> this<00:03:24.209> would<00:03:24.780> you<00:03:24.959> wear<00:03:25.260> linen<00:03:26.070> that's

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
wear this would you wear linen that's

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.330 
wear this would you wear linen that's
kind<00:03:27.030> of<00:03:27.090> in<00:03:27.239> an<00:03:27.330> orange-red<00:03:27.900> color<00:03:28.160> that's<00:03:29.160> a

boxy<00:03:29.790> shape<00:03:30.200> because<00:03:31.200> it<00:03:31.950> has<00:03:32.160> that<00:03:32.459> authority

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
boxy shape because it has that authority

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.680 
boxy shape because it has that authority
of<00:03:33.830> being<00:03:34.830> expensive<00:03:35.340> would<00:03:36.180> you<00:03:36.330> wear<00:03:36.540> it

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
of being expensive would you wear it

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.300
