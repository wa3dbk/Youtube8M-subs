00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
develop a suite of traffic getting

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.999 
develop a suite of traffic getting

could use to get fast and reliable free
traffic<00:01:56.509> turns<00:01:57.509> out<00:01:57.719> though<00:01:57.960> it's<00:01:58.259> harder

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
traffic turns out though it's harder

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.499 
traffic turns out though it's harder
than<00:01:58.799> we<00:01:59.009> thought<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.520> make<00:01:59.670> apples<00:02:00.090> kind<00:02:00.299> of

than we thought to make apples kind of

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.990 
than we thought to make apples kind of
world-class<00:02:00.810> software<00:02:01.290> easy<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.520> use<00:02:02.549> and

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
world-class software easy to use and

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.319 
world-class software easy to use and
works<00:02:03.420> great<00:02:03.750> doesn't<00:02:03.990> come<00:02:04.920> cheap<00:02:05.399> also
