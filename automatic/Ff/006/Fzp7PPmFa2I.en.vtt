we<00:00:47.540> determine<00:00:47.720> our<00:00:48.170> rafter<00:00:48.590> lengths<00:00:49.930> mark<00:00:50.930> the

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:51.080 
we determine our rafter lengths mark the

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.870 
we determine our rafter lengths mark the
rafters<00:00:51.560> and<00:00:52.510> cut<00:00:53.510> them<00:00:53.720> one<00:00:53.900> by<00:00:54.050> one<00:00:54.880> after

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:55.880 
rafters and cut them one by one after

this common rafter in a little more

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.570 
this common rafter in a little more
detail<00:01:52.649> we've<00:01:53.649> had<00:01:53.860> to<00:01:53.979> make<00:01:54.130> a<00:01:54.160> couple<00:01:54.429> of

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
detail we've had to make a couple of

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.370 
detail we've had to make a couple of
cuts<00:01:54.789> on<00:01:55.030> it<00:01:55.060> here<00:01:55.720> at<00:01:55.780> the<00:01:55.869> top<00:01:56.050> we<00:01:56.229> have<00:01:56.350> a

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
cuts on it here at the top we have a

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.520 
cuts on it here at the top we have a
ridge<00:01:56.679> cut<00:01:57.009> that<00:01:57.789> allows<00:01:58.119> this<00:01:58.509> common<00:01:59.140> rafter

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
ridge cut that allows this common rafter

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.770 
ridge cut that allows this common rafter
to<00:01:59.679> fits<00:01:59.920> right<00:02:00.310> snug<00:02:00.670> against<00:02:01.390> that<00:02:01.509> Ridge

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
to fits right snug against that Ridge

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.620 
to fits right snug against that Ridge
down<00:02:02.490> at<00:02:03.490> the<00:02:03.610> bottom<00:02:03.910> now<00:02:04.030> we<00:02:04.090> have<00:02:04.330> a<00:02:04.360> seat

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
down at the bottom now we have a seat

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.070 
down at the bottom now we have a seat
cut<00:02:04.950> we<00:02:05.950> cut<00:02:06.159> this<00:02:06.310> notch<00:02:06.550> out<00:02:06.850> so<00:02:07.539> this<00:02:07.720> common

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
cut we cut this notch out so this common

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.169 
cut we cut this notch out so this common
rafter<00:02:08.530> could<00:02:09.070> fit<00:02:09.310> right<00:02:09.580> down<00:02:09.820> on<00:02:10.000> that

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
rafter could fit right down on that

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.710 
rafter could fit right down on that
plate<00:02:11.100> now<00:02:12.100> the<00:02:12.160> pitch<00:02:12.459> of<00:02:12.640> this<00:02:12.819> roof<00:02:13.090> is<00:02:13.390> four

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
plate now the pitch of this roof is four

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.559 
plate now the pitch of this roof is four
and<00:02:13.870> twelve<00:02:14.170> well<00:02:15.010> what<00:02:15.190> does<00:02:15.310> that<00:02:15.340> mean<00:02:15.569> it

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
and twelve well what does that mean it

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.860 
and twelve well what does that mean it
means<00:02:16.810> that<00:02:17.370> for<00:02:18.370> every<00:02:18.610> 12<00:02:18.850> inches<00:02:19.060> that<00:02:19.660> this

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
means that for every 12 inches that this

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.350 
means that for every 12 inches that this
rafter<00:02:20.320> runs<00:02:20.530> in<00:02:20.709> on<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:21.010> level<00:02:21.340> it<00:02:21.790> rises

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
rafter runs in on the level it rises

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.910 
rafter runs in on the level it rises
four<00:02:22.959> inches<00:02:23.380> it's<00:02:24.190> as<00:02:24.340> simple<00:02:24.489> as<00:02:24.760> that<00:02:25.920> so

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
four inches it's as simple as that so

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.009 
four inches it's as simple as that so
how<00:02:27.070> did<00:02:27.280> we<00:02:27.310> know<00:02:27.579> how<00:02:27.820> long<00:02:28.150> to<00:02:28.630> cut<00:02:28.840> this

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
how did we know how long to cut this

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.030 
how did we know how long to cut this
rafter<00:02:29.560> well<00:02:30.400> one<00:02:30.700> way<00:02:30.880> to<00:02:30.910> do<00:02:31.209> that<00:02:31.360> is<00:02:31.600> this

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
rafter well one way to do that is this

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.460 
rafter well one way to do that is this
you<00:02:33.040> measure<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.519> span<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.930> span<00:02:35.230> of<00:02:35.260> a

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
you measure the span the span of a

building is from the outside to the
outside<00:02:37.290> here<00:02:38.290> we<00:02:38.440> have<00:02:38.590> five<00:02:38.860> feet<00:02:39.570> once<00:02:40.570> we

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
outside here we have five feet once we

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.350 
outside here we have five feet once we
know<00:02:40.930> that<00:02:41.220> we<00:02:42.220> can<00:02:42.370> use<00:02:42.400> a<00:02:42.549> book<00:02:42.790> of<00:02:42.970> rafter

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
know that we can use a book of rafter

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.080 
know that we can use a book of rafter
tables<00:02:43.780> we<00:02:44.650> open<00:02:44.950> it<00:02:45.070> to<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.310> pitch<00:02:45.519> four<00:02:45.940> and

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
tables we open it to the pitch four and

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.800 
tables we open it to the pitch four and
twelve<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:48.040> then<00:02:48.220> we<00:02:48.880> go<00:02:49.030> over<00:02:49.239> to<00:02:49.360> the<00:02:49.480> common

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
twelve and then we go over to the common

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.250 
twelve and then we go over to the common
rafter<00:02:50.170> column<00:02:50.620> down<00:02:51.489> to<00:02:51.730> five<00:02:51.970> feet<00:02:52.329> and<00:02:53.110> we

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
rafter column down to five feet and we

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.530 
rafter column down to five feet and we
see<00:02:53.500> that<00:02:53.829> the<00:02:53.980> length<00:02:54.160> of<00:02:54.370> this<00:02:54.489> rafter<00:02:55.090> is

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
see that the length of this rafter is

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.370 
see that the length of this rafter is
two<00:02:55.840> feet<00:02:56.079> seven<00:02:56.709> and<00:02:56.829> five-eighths<00:02:57.220> inches

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
two feet seven and five-eighths inches

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.830 
two feet seven and five-eighths inches
now<00:02:59.380> that's<00:03:00.070> the<00:03:00.310> distance<00:03:00.760> from<00:03:00.940> the<00:03:01.540> center

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
now that's the distance from the center

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.160 
now that's the distance from the center
of<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.019> ridge<00:03:02.459> down<00:03:03.459> this<00:03:03.670> common<00:03:04.090> rafter<00:03:04.510> to

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
of the ridge down this common rafter to

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.349 
of the ridge down this common rafter to
the<00:03:05.290> outside<00:03:05.680> of<00:03:05.799> the<00:03:05.890> building<00:03:06.040> of<00:03:06.970> course<00:03:07.180> it

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:07.359 
the outside of the building of course it

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:10.530 
the outside of the building of course it
doesn't<00:03:07.540> include<00:03:07.959> this<00:03:08.769> rafter<00:03:09.250> tail<00:03:09.540> now

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
doesn't include this rafter tail now

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.410 
doesn't include this rafter tail now
back<00:03:10.750> up<00:03:10.959> here<00:03:11.200> at<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.380> ridge<00:03:12.000> this<00:03:13.000> common

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
back up here at the ridge this common

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.390 
back up here at the ridge this common
rafter<00:03:13.780> doesn't<00:03:14.140> run<00:03:14.350> to<00:03:14.680> the<00:03:14.799> center<00:03:15.130> of<00:03:15.280> the

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
rafter doesn't run to the center of the

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.940 
rafter doesn't run to the center of the
ridge<00:03:15.579> so<00:03:15.970> we<00:03:16.540> had<00:03:16.660> to<00:03:16.810> shorten<00:03:17.260> the<00:03:17.560> length<00:03:17.590> of

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
ridge so we had to shorten the length of

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.710 
ridge so we had to shorten the length of
all<00:03:18.070> these<00:03:18.310> common<00:03:18.700> rafters<00:03:19.120> three-quarters

all these common rafters three-quarters

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.220 
all these common rafters three-quarters
of<00:03:19.750> an<00:03:19.930> inch

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
of an inch

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.240 
of an inch
that's<00:03:20.500> half<00:03:20.709> the<00:03:20.890> thickness<00:03:21.070> of<00:03:21.370> this<00:03:21.519> Ridge

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
that's half the thickness of this Ridge

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.520 
that's half the thickness of this Ridge
back<00:03:24.250> on<00:03:24.489> these<00:03:24.699> joists<00:03:25.000> you'll<00:03:25.989> notice<00:03:26.380> how

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
back on these joists you'll notice how

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:27.900 
back on these joists you'll notice how
we<00:03:26.590> clip<00:03:26.949> this<00:03:27.160> joist<00:03:27.489> so

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
we clip this joist so

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.060 
we clip this joist so
wouldn't<00:03:28.240> stick<00:03:28.420> up<00:03:28.570> above<00:03:28.690> this<00:03:29.020> rafter<00:03:29.500> now

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
wouldn't stick up above this rafter now

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.190 
wouldn't stick up above this rafter now
these<00:03:30.280> joists<00:03:30.700> are<00:03:30.790> really<00:03:31.000> important<00:03:31.480> they

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
these joists are really important they

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.740 
these joists are really important they
get<00:03:32.440> nailed<00:03:32.680> into<00:03:32.920> this<00:03:33.130> rafter<00:03:33.700> and<00:03:33.940> actually

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
together now on this end joist you'll

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.580 
together now on this end joist you'll
notice<00:03:43.450> that<00:03:43.600> we<00:03:43.720> didn't<00:03:43.990> set<00:03:44.140> it<00:03:44.170> on<00:03:44.380> edge

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
notice that we didn't set it on edge

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.700 
notice that we didn't set it on edge
rather<00:03:44.950> we<00:03:45.490> laid<00:03:45.670> it<00:03:45.820> flat<00:03:46.170> that<00:03:47.170> way<00:03:47.380> we<00:03:47.530> have

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:47.710 
rather we laid it flat that way we have

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:49.410 
rather we laid it flat that way we have
