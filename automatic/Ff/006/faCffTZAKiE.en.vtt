00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
FPS on this game in 1080p but this is

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.330 
FPS on this game in 1080p but this is
like<00:01:32.549> I<00:01:32.909> think<00:01:33.329> double<00:01:33.869> or<00:01:33.990> triple<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.530> normal

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
like I think double or triple the normal

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.469 
like I think double or triple the normal
resolution<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:36.060> think<00:01:36.270> it's<00:01:36.360> actually

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
resolution I think it's actually

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.480 
resolution I think it's actually
quadruple<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.200> way<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.320> have<00:01:37.530> my<00:01:37.710> scaling<00:01:38.070> set

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
quadruple the way I have my scaling set

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.060 
quadruple the way I have my scaling set
so<00:01:38.759> there's<00:01:39.509> more<00:01:39.689> pixels<00:01:40.170> with<00:01:40.439> everything

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
so there's more pixels with everything

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.670 
so there's more pixels with everything

Sun<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.629> Sun<00:02:10.020> is<00:02:10.289> I<00:02:10.770> mean<00:02:11.039> like<00:02:11.160> right<00:02:11.340> here

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
Sun the Sun is I mean like right here

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.250 
Sun the Sun is I mean like right here
this<00:02:11.700> is<00:02:11.760> obvious<00:02:12.450> you're<00:02:12.540> going<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.720> get<00:02:12.780> high

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
this is obvious you're going to get high

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.600 
this is obvious you're going to get high
so<00:02:13.530> you<00:02:13.620> drop<00:02:13.860> down<00:02:14.010> here<00:02:14.189> then<00:02:14.340> it's<00:02:14.489> gonna

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
so you drop down here then it's gonna

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.630 
so you drop down here then it's gonna
get<00:02:15.390> crazy<00:02:15.569> a<00:02:15.900> lot<00:02:16.049> but<00:02:16.290> this<00:02:16.409> is<00:02:16.620> I<00:02:17.040> don't

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
get crazy a lot but this is I don't

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.640 
get crazy a lot but this is I don't
think<00:02:17.670> this<00:02:18.090> is<00:02:18.150> max<00:02:18.569> field<00:02:18.870> of<00:02:18.989> vision<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.409> let

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
think this is max field of vision to let

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.509 
think this is max field of vision to let
me<00:02:19.769> see<00:02:21.379> vertical<00:02:22.379> yes<00:02:22.560> a<00:02:22.739> vertical<00:02:23.189> sync<00:02:23.400> off

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
me see vertical yes a vertical sync off

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:24.440 
me see vertical yes a vertical sync off
because<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:23.730> makes<00:02:23.879> it<00:02:24.000> like<00:02:24.060> but<00:02:24.239> i<00:02:24.269> have<00:02:24.390> the

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
because it makes it like but i have the

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.119 
because it makes it like but i have the
nvidia<00:02:24.750> depth<00:02:25.019> of<00:02:25.200> field<00:02:25.500> on<00:02:25.680> which<00:02:25.920> is

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
nvidia depth of field on which is

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.130 
nvidia depth of field on which is
awesome<00:02:26.280> i<00:02:26.579> have<00:02:26.730> i<00:02:26.909> have<00:02:26.970> everything<00:02:27.659> to<00:02:28.049> the
