 rosso almost we have not been able to see nor the summit of the manaslú 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.359
 and it is very tempting to start in these warm days of trekking 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:26.720
 It has been a good trekking of seven days until we know what we have 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.660

 a day i not in which we are in the base camp

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.460
 magnificent rivers we can bathe even in hot springs 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.680
 is they say that water is life here in this sad the truth that water is 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.580
 lifetime

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.010
 rivers and bridges 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.790

 and the people of nepal to me the truth that transmits many things to me with their 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.020
 smile on their faces their things 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.590
 all the gratitude that they transmit to you 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.940
