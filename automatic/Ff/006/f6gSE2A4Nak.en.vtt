00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.100
 asked about drawing in korea 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.340
 in general, some Koreans like I do not know 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.010
 how robots are real though with emotions with 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.469
 emotions are not all right, even too much 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.849
 they all do well you them but what a 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.910
 then sleight of hand 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.460
 brains quickly think I already talked about 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.380
 could they play well they are all 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.359
 see them have a very quick reaction plus 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.099
 they always learn some school 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.689
 instrument music not play on 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.440
 any musical instrument 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.870
 so they are also practically musical 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:40.079
 so many sing well with me 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:43.739
 sister husband he sings very well 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.710
 well and of course draws draw they ask 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.620
 Many I talked mostly with children but 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.660
 and a few adults the same 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.180
 men playing with a baby doe visible 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.360
 screen of some cartoon character 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.420
 immediately took it and painted it a long time ago 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.399
 most nephew whom I do not remember from two 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.320
 years he began to draw something there 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.100
 they are constantly drawing something in the garden 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.729
 school, by the way , school is still given an assignment 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.850
 keep diaries 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.310
 they are many here eggs faced this 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.409
 in English it was necessary to give a tower 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.210
 building in the form of diaries they should have 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.930
 English writing is not for me to lead 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.090
 a diary 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.130
 and then I had to check it 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.680
 the same thing they have on other subjects 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.340
 in fact, the school may not even subject to 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.020
 school they should keep a diary and this 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.470
 checks so they make them out these 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:38.100
 diaries are very beautiful in general terms 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.680
 design korea much it shows it 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.420
 just the whole day walking and shopping

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.440
 something interesting to find in terms of design 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.760
 but in general, here are these things in 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.420

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.230
 delicious up in terms of design they are all 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.260
 OK 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.990
 maybe it's because they are 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.070
 well draw i don't know but in terms of 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.860
 arts 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.170
 such is the art of how the general 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:08.150
 which can somehow be used here 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:10.980
 these things are different things 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.530
 coming up with a very betrothed original 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.720
 the original goods pretty much just 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.090
 I still haven't got an apartment yet 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.790
 I designed everything I plan to issue here 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.580
 a lot of different here 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:26.010
 The stickers did not say that the wallpaper changed 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.170
 so I decided to take there different 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.360
 Stickers on the subject of thinking about 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.400
 just haven't figured out what exactly 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.310
 I want it because I want a lot of things 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.860
 so as it is all I do not know one thing 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.110
 has not yet chosen Korea with the choice of hard 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.750
 itâ€™s hard for me to choose because 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:46.680
 huge choice that I do not know what to choose 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:49.320
 Yes, I curtain all myself I am looking for suitable 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.200
 I have not found it yet and so I have an apartment 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:56.700
 still standing I can't decide 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:58.150
 what style i want to make it for myself 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.069
 so it is not 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.920
 I ate a lot so that I do 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:06.250
 somewhere far away from the body in general 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.769
 Koreans draw well they paint themselves 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.049
 childhood I do not know what it is but 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:14.379
 here somehow they generally 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:16.449
 sm only well not all this even in 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:18.729
 billiards they sat for a long time in a restaurant there 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:21.430
 one of the visitors decided to play 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:23.229
 billiards billiards free and play was 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.330
 several restaurant was practically 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:26.650
 empty game was with no one there 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.470
 cooks guys went 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:32.050
 asked if they want to play with him and he 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:35.440
 lost them all take turns 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:38.710
 in billiards they are also elections whether arte 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.380
 all that concerns hands and what kind of brains 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:44.139
 creativity in korea with that well 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.120
 despite the fact that they pinch it 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:48.280
 these traditions may be because of me 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.940
 times the more pressure the more 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.080
 expressed creativity here comes 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.949
 think more 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.000
 There you have it, and just a boy with 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:00.130
 which I studied 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.740
 his mother is such a very strong-willed woman 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:05.229
 such control and she constantly 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.479
 makes him learn she is so one of 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:09.460
 The best students surprised me as if 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:10.270
 on his constantly pressed and he is at the same time 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.669
 with pleasure 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.080
 study and then he somehow brought me 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:17.320
 own drafts 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.729
 in general, it makes the process interesting if 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.220
 We need to do something 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:23.560
 he just does it in his own way so that 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.260
 it was interesting for him and since he 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.479
 likes to draw and draw now 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:31.030
 little because he's high school now 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:32.289
 he needs to do a lot 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.530
 drafts 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:37.630
 Different color pens introduced in the form 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:40.810
 drawings that is, let's say mathematics 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:43.360
 such a color and English a different color and 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:46.000
 so on and so combined 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.130
 useful from nice so he likes military 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.070
 subject of course then of course he 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.910
 it was 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:55.160
 she mastered the technique different tanks 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:58.600
 winchester i'm not outside the package general 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:04.000
 Koreans in this plan in terms of drawing 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:04.000
 stars are not all good yet bye
