00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
person like I could say home with almost

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.670 
person like I could say home with almost
complete<00:01:54.149> certainty<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.600> eighty<00:01:55.590> percent

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
complete certainty that eighty percent

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.609 
complete certainty that eighty percent
of<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.040> time<00:01:56.219> when<00:01:56.610> i<00:01:56.640> played<00:01:57.439> S&amp;D<00:01:58.439> in

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
of the time when i played S&amp;D in

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.139 
of the time when i played S&amp;D in
different<00:01:59.340> games<00:01:59.490> because<00:01:59.790> i<00:01:59.880> haven't<00:02:00.030> played

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
different games because i haven't played

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.149 
different games because i haven't played
in<00:02:00.360> this<00:02:00.450> game<00:02:00.540> yet<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:01.020> would<00:02:01.680> almost<00:02:01.829> always

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
in this game yet I would almost always

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.270 
in this game yet I would almost always
cross<00:02:02.729> over<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:04.049> enemy<00:02:04.500> I<00:02:04.530> killed<00:02:04.829> after<00:02:05.070> I

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
cross over the enemy I killed after I

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.100 
cross over the enemy I killed after I
kill<00:02:05.520> them<00:02:05.700> why<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:06.210> don't<00:02:06.600> really<00:02:06.689> know<00:02:06.899> maybe

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
kill them why I don't really know maybe

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.570 
kill them why I don't really know maybe
I<00:02:07.259> just<00:02:07.530> wanted<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:07.829> move<00:02:07.979> forward<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.429> that's

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
I just wanted to move forward and that's

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.740 
I just wanted to move forward and that's
just<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.819> best<00:02:08.940> way<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.119> do<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.300> just<00:02:09.450> over<00:02:09.660> the

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
just the best way to do it just over the

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.449 
just the best way to do it just over the
guy<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:09.929> killed<00:02:10.229> but<00:02:11.039> in<00:02:11.129> this<00:02:11.220> game<00:02:11.310> you

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
guy you killed but in this game you

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.990 
guy you killed but in this game you
really<00:02:11.879> can't<00:02:12.120> do<00:02:12.270> that<00:02:12.390> because<00:02:12.450> if

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
really can't do that because if

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.120 
really can't do that because if
do<00:02:13.270> you're<00:02:14.170> going<00:02:14.260> to<00:02:14.320> grab<00:02:14.530> that<00:02:14.680> tag<00:02:14.950> and

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
do you're going to grab that tag and

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.620 
do you're going to grab that tag and
everyone's<00:02:15.490> going<00:02:15.610> to<00:02:15.640> know<00:02:15.730> exactly<00:02:15.940> where

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
everyone's going to know exactly where

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:17.880 
everyone's going to know exactly where
you<00:02:16.780> are<00:02:16.810> and<00:02:17.110> that<00:02:17.260> you're<00:02:17.380> their<00:02:17.560> heads<00:02:17.770> are

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
you are and that you're their heads are

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.810 
you are and that you're their heads are
just<00:02:18.040> going<00:02:18.190> to<00:02:18.250> turn<00:02:18.430> so<00:02:20.130> just<00:02:21.130> kind<00:02:21.520> of<00:02:21.640> I

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
just going to turn so just kind of I

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.420 
just going to turn so just kind of I
don't<00:02:21.880> know<00:02:22.090> you<00:02:22.720> can't<00:02:23.050> just<00:02:23.770> run<00:02:24.010> /<00:02:24.190> tags

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
don't know you can't just run / tags

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.280 
don't know you can't just run / tags
aimlessly<00:02:25.000> you<00:02:25.270> you<00:02:25.570> do<00:02:25.780> have<00:02:25.810> to<00:02:26.110> wait<00:02:26.260> a

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
aimlessly you you do have to wait a

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.780 
aimlessly you you do have to wait a
second<00:02:26.740> or<00:02:26.860> two<00:02:26.890> to<00:02:27.010> make<00:02:27.160> sure<00:02:27.430> it's<00:02:27.580> safe

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
second or two to make sure it's safe

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.440 
second or two to make sure it's safe
that's<00:02:28.690> why<00:02:28.900> for<00:02:29.470> snr<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:30.610> pink<00:02:31.030> perk<00:02:31.240> is

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
that's why for snr the pink perk is

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.050 
that's why for snr the pink perk is
absolutely<00:02:32.230> amazing<00:02:32.470> because<00:02:33.400> you<00:02:33.670> can<00:02:33.850> get

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
absolutely amazing because you can get

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.140 
absolutely amazing because you can get
some<00:02:34.470> you<00:02:35.470> can<00:02:35.620> get<00:02:35.740> a<00:02:35.770> kill<00:02:36.040> have<00:02:36.550> it<00:02:36.700> ping<00:02:36.940> if

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
some you can get a kill have it ping if

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.210 
some you can get a kill have it ping if
no<00:02:37.390> one's<00:02:37.420> in<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:37.780> area<00:02:38.110> you're<00:02:38.709> probably

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
no one's in the area you're probably

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.640 
no one's in the area you're probably
safe<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:39.730> go<00:02:39.970> grab<00:02:40.180> it<00:02:40.240> and<00:02:40.510> if<00:02:41.020> not<00:02:41.170> you<00:02:41.530> can

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
safe to go grab it and if not you can

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.110 
safe to go grab it and if not you can
wait<00:02:41.920> for<00:02:41.950> get<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.400> other<00:02:42.520> to<00:02:42.640> get<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.910> next

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
wait for get the other to get the next

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.210 
wait for get the other to get the next
kill<00:02:43.300> written<00:02:44.290> basically<00:02:44.740> just<00:02:44.860> rinse<00:02:45.070> and
