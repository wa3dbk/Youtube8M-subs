00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.840
 aulas wielding gentlemen here are the explanations qantas this piece of 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.210
 domenico scarlatti and harpsichordist 18th coming from italy 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.270
 some small technical details% and the difficulties of this piece before 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.710
 lie in the interpretation of screams mainly this kind of plan 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.730
 m 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:27.770
 that's why 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.500
 finally have a good coach but at the level of the left hand are very 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.330
 very dry nervous like that is very accurate 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.320
 'the difficulties his rabbits were in very big these are pieces for 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.180
 harpsichord so necessarily the cold season that two keyboardists they have a 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.650
 advantage over us for the apa has offered very great players pay 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:43.670
 without spilling 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.890
 only one second so there too we have steeple arpeggios for example if 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.890
 flat that have set the course in the middle of the room 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.640
 Boulègue 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.390
 accompanied by the left hand you have to be a lot of people in his yard 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.330
 not counting the box because otherwise 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.060
 eba we get pretty ugly here is very quickly my kind of things 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.310
 then 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.520
 the last big difficulty is an asset the passage a little bit extra 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.429
 Teemix 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.429
 during six months 

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:17.929
 mm 

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:19.170
 of the political base 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.650
 besides, who climbs the harmony genius of scarlatti menu 

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:26.680
 but for a precious level 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.680
 other fingering of the left hand 

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:34.109
 specific goods for the other bodies of the right hand obviously 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.799
 last little thing about the final arpeggios 

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:43.449
 I am very careful because traveling in Savoy 

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:47.269
 taken between the first two pages 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.269
 compare the left hand really needs to be nervous superman 

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:55.519
 go directly bernard pech to another here it's over for these 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.659
 little explanations and other billevesées I tell you rendez-vous 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:03.099
 in a next year in a future adventure of classical music with 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.310
 elegance
