off<00:00:32.880> I<00:00:33.180> rarely<00:00:33.420> play<00:00:33.870> third<00:00:34.200> person<00:00:34.770> mainly

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
off I rarely play third person mainly

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.280 
off I rarely play third person mainly
because<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:36.120> don't<00:00:36.270> know<00:00:36.300> I'm<00:00:36.600> just<00:00:36.630> not<00:00:36.960> used

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
because I don't know I'm just not used

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.010 
because I don't know I'm just not used
to<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:38.070> I've<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:38.670> haven't<00:00:39.420> really<00:00:39.570> played<00:00:39.840> this

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
to it I've I haven't really played this

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.530 
to it I've I haven't really played this
a<00:00:40.079> lot<00:00:40.340> I<00:00:41.340> think<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:42.030> there<00:00:42.180> was<00:00:42.270> more

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
a lot I think that there was more

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.540 
a lot I think that there was more
selections<00:00:43.200> like<00:00:43.680> instead<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:44.070> third<00:00:44.340> person

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
selections like instead of third person

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.150 
selections like instead of third person
team<00:00:44.940> tactical<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.660> third<00:00:46.590> person<00:00:46.770> cage

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
team tactical and third person cage

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.799 
team tactical and third person cage
match<00:00:47.399> like<00:00:47.640> they<00:00:47.789> had<00:00:47.940> third<00:00:48.120> person<00:00:48.539> search

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
match like they had third person search

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.150 
match like they had third person search
and<00:00:48.960> destroying<00:00:49.260> stuff<00:00:49.440> like<00:00:49.620> that<00:00:49.649> then<00:00:49.980> i'd

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
and destroying stuff like that then i'd

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.549 
and destroying stuff like that then i'd
i'd<00:00:50.850> probably<00:00:51.180> played<00:00:51.690> third<00:00:51.870> person<00:00:52.350> more<00:00:52.530> i

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
i'd probably played third person more i

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.740 
i'd probably played third person more i
don't<00:00:52.829> know<00:00:52.920> it's<00:00:53.820> just<00:00:54.030> kind<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.390> different

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
don't know it's just kind of different

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.180 
don't know it's just kind of different
for<00:00:54.930> me<00:00:55.050> so<00:00:55.230> i<00:00:55.260> really<00:00:55.469> don't<00:00:55.590> play<00:00:55.920> it<00:00:56.039> too

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
for me so i really don't play it too

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.860 
for me so i really don't play it too
much<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.910> plus<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.300> don't<00:00:57.420> get<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.660> choose

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
much and plus you don't get to choose

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.410 
much and plus you don't get to choose
what<00:00:58.140> game<00:00:58.949> mode<00:00:59.219> gametype<00:00:59.969> you're<00:01:00.149> playing

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.499 
from the corner of the wall to the other

noobs<00:02:08.789> ooh<00:02:09.119> stuff<00:02:09.509> like<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:09.720> because<00:02:10.110> you

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
noobs ooh stuff like that because you

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.530 
noobs ooh stuff like that because you
can't<00:02:11.280> see<00:02:11.490> through<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.790> red<00:02:11.970> dot<00:02:12.150> so<00:02:12.390> there's

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
can't see through the red dot so there's

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.300 
can't see through the red dot so there's
no<00:02:12.660> point<00:02:12.810> putting<00:02:13.080> it<00:02:14.420> another<00:02:15.500> quick<00:02:16.500> tip<00:02:16.770> I

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
no point putting it another quick tip I

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.290 
no point putting it another quick tip I
guess<00:02:18.950> this<00:02:19.950> is<00:02:20.130> something<00:02:20.520> that<00:02:20.550> I<00:02:20.700> found<00:02:21.090> out

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
guess this is something that I found out

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.930 
guess this is something that I found out
in<00:02:21.600> game<00:02:21.660> battles<00:02:22.470> from<00:02:23.400> playing<00:02:23.730> game

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
in game battles from playing game

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.600 
in game battles from playing game
battles<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:24.569> playing<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:25.250> lot<00:02:26.250> of<00:02:26.370> call<00:02:26.580> of

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
battles and playing a lot of call of

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.850 
battles and playing a lot of call of
duty<00:02:27.000> i<00:02:27.030> guess<00:02:27.300> and<00:02:27.660> that's<00:02:28.200> you<00:02:28.560> don't<00:02:28.739> want

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
duty i guess and that's you don't want

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.850 
duty i guess and that's you don't want
to<00:02:28.950> be<00:02:29.040> predictable<00:02:29.989> meaning<00:02:30.989> i<00:02:31.170> don't<00:02:31.770> know

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
to be predictable meaning i don't know

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.490 
to be predictable meaning i don't know
how<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:32.010> explain<00:02:32.310> it<00:02:32.430> but<00:02:32.870> you<00:02:33.870> always<00:02:34.170> want<00:02:34.440> to

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
how to explain it but you always want to

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.350 
how to explain it but you always want to
know<00:02:34.590> what<00:02:35.130> your<00:02:35.400> enemy<00:02:35.700> not<00:02:35.850> to<00:02:36.060> know<00:02:36.180> where

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
you you have to actually think about

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.530 
you you have to actually think about
what<00:03:05.489> you're<00:03:05.640> doing<00:03:05.670> before<00:03:05.970> you<00:03:06.269> do<00:03:06.510> it

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
what you're doing before you do it

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.170 
what you're doing before you do it
because<00:03:07.019> I<00:03:07.260> don't<00:03:07.799> know<00:03:07.860> I<00:03:07.890> just<00:03:08.010> I<00:03:08.430> don't<00:03:09.030> know

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
because I don't know I just I don't know

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.600 
because I don't know I just I don't know
I<00:03:09.239> just<00:03:09.299> make<00:03:09.780> it<00:03:09.810> just<00:03:10.170> smarter<00:03:10.560> gaming<00:03:11.519> I

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
I just make it just smarter gaming I

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.710 
I just make it just smarter gaming I
guess<00:03:11.790> you<00:03:11.910> can<00:03:12.090> say<00:03:12.299> and<00:03:14.299> you<00:03:15.299> always<00:03:15.450> got<00:03:15.690> to

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
guess you can say and you always got to

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.210 
guess you can say and you always got to
think<00:03:15.959> about<00:03:16.200> what<00:03:16.350> you<00:03:16.530> do<00:03:16.680> and<00:03:16.709> stuff<00:03:17.040> like

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
think about what you do and stuff like

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.940 
think about what you do and stuff like
that<00:03:17.480> because<00:03:18.480> when<00:03:19.170> you<00:03:19.260> do<00:03:19.410> that<00:03:19.620> you<00:03:19.920> just

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
that because when you do that you just

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.150 
that because when you do that you just
do<00:03:20.730> better<00:03:21.000> I<00:03:21.360> noticed<00:03:21.989> and<00:03:22.320> let's<00:03:22.799> just<00:03:22.890> I

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
do better I noticed and let's just I

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.160 
do better I noticed and let's just I
don't<00:03:23.250> know<00:03:23.400> if<00:03:23.640> you<00:03:24.209> actually<00:03:24.359> put<00:03:24.810> a<00:03:24.840> thought

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
don't know if you actually put a thought

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.030 
don't know if you actually put a thought
some<00:03:25.829> thought<00:03:26.160> and<00:03:26.430> do<00:03:27.680> when<00:03:28.680> you're<00:03:28.799> playing

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
some thought and do when you're playing

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.410 
some thought and do when you're playing
if<00:03:29.250> you<00:03:29.340> actually<00:03:29.430> put<00:03:29.790> some<00:03:29.820> thought<00:03:30.359> into

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
if you actually put some thought into

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.410 
if you actually put some thought into
your<00:03:31.079> decisions<00:03:31.769> and<00:03:32.100> uh<00:03:32.280> it'll<00:03:33.120> definitely

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
your decisions and uh it'll definitely

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.860 
your decisions and uh it'll definitely
make<00:03:33.750> a<00:03:33.900> huge<00:03:34.320> difference<00:03:34.590> and<00:03:35.870> you'll

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
make a huge difference and you'll

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.229 
make a huge difference and you'll
probably<00:03:37.230> most<00:03:38.040> of<00:03:38.130> times<00:03:38.400> do<00:03:38.700> better<00:03:38.940> in<00:03:39.120> the

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
probably most of times do better in the

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.620 
probably most of times do better in the
games<00:03:39.480> and<00:03:39.810> stuff<00:03:39.989> like<00:03:40.170> that<00:03:40.230> so<00:03:41.540> yeah<00:03:42.540> that's

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
games and stuff like that so yeah that's

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.960 
games and stuff like that so yeah that's
just<00:03:42.930> I<00:03:43.049> guess<00:03:43.260> a<00:03:43.290> quick<00:03:43.680> tip<00:03:43.920> for<00:03:43.980> you<00:03:44.250> guys

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.540 
this happened to me on a domination game
where<00:06:43.720> the<00:06:43.840> host<00:06:44.020> just<00:06:44.530> leaves<00:06:44.830> and<00:06:45.220> then<00:06:45.370> you

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:45.550 
where the host just leaves and then you

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.089 
where the host just leaves and then you
can't<00:06:45.789> connect<00:06:46.150> I<00:06:46.449> was<00:06:47.379> pretty<00:06:47.590> pissed<00:06:47.860> off

00:06:48.089 --> 00:06:48.099

00:06:49.619 --> 00:06:49.629 
when this happened and like when it says

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:51.719 
when this happened and like when it says
sent<00:06:49.900> a<00:06:50.080> hundred<00:06:50.409> percent<00:06:50.590> of<00:06:50.860> blocks<00:06:51.099> for<00:06:51.699> a

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:51.729 
sent a hundred percent of blocks for a

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:53.159 
sent a hundred percent of blocks for a
long<00:06:51.909> time<00:06:52.150> that<00:06:52.180> means<00:06:52.539> that<00:06:52.750> it's<00:06:52.840> not<00:06:52.960> going

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:53.169 
long time that means that it's not going

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:54.629 
long time that means that it's not going
to<00:06:53.229> find<00:06:53.349> a<00:06:53.440> new<00:06:53.560> host<00:06:53.770> and<00:06:54.069> you're<00:06:54.490> going<00:06:54.580> to
