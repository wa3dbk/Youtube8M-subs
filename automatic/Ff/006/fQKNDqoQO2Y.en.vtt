things first of all I want you to think

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.170 
things first of all I want you to think
about<00:00:43.110> getting<00:00:43.379> lower<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.309> ground<00:00:44.340> this

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
about getting lower to the ground this

about getting lower to the ground this
is<00:00:45.329> going<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.539> help<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.899> have<00:00:46.079> more<00:00:46.410> control

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
is going to help you have more control

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.740 
is going to help you have more control
over<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.219> ball<00:00:47.460> it's<00:00:48.090> also<00:00:48.239> going<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.570> help

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
over the ball it's also going to help

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.350 
over the ball it's also going to help
you<00:00:48.899> change<00:00:48.930> direction<00:00:49.640> more<00:00:50.640> effectively

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
you change direction more effectively

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.209 
you change direction more effectively
second<00:00:52.199> thing<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.410> want<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.680> think<00:00:52.829> about<00:00:52.860> is

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
second thing I want to think about is

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.180 
second thing I want to think about is
having<00:00:53.780> effective<00:00:54.780> touches<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:55.829> instead<00:00:56.129> of

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
having effective touches so instead of

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.830 
having effective touches so instead of
having<00:00:56.460> lots<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:57.059> touches<00:00:57.420> on<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.660> bowl<00:00:57.809> I

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
having lots of touches on the bowl I

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.330 
having lots of touches on the bowl I
want<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.350> try<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.620> get<00:00:58.949> through<00:00:59.129> this

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
want you to try to get through this

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.240 
want you to try to get through this
course<00:00:59.640> get<00:01:00.030> through<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.359> cones<00:01:00.600> with<00:01:01.500> as<00:01:01.680> few

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
course get through the cones with as few

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.729 
course get through the cones with as few
touches<00:01:02.670> as<00:01:03.059> possible<00:01:03.870> okay<00:01:04.409> but<00:01:04.589> they're

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
touches as possible okay but they're

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.350 
touches as possible okay but they're
going<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.890> have<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.189> be<00:01:05.309> precise<00:01:06.000> and

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
going to have to be precise and

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.899 
going to have to be precise and
effective<00:01:07.020> touches<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:08.310> get<00:01:08.580> through<00:01:08.820> the

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
effective touches to get through the

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.179 
effective touches to get through the
cones<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:10.049> third<00:01:10.290> thing<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.710> want<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.979> think

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
cones the third thing I want to think

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.340 
cones the third thing I want to think
about<00:01:11.280> is<00:01:11.610> when<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.630> have<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.020> space<00:01:13.320> to

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
about is when you have the space to

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.219 
about is when you have the space to
accelerate<00:01:14.159> so<00:01:14.340> on<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.580> straightaways

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
accelerate so on the straightaways

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.020 
accelerate so on the straightaways
really<00:01:16.229> accelerate<00:01:16.860> don't<00:01:17.100> just<00:01:17.310> jog<00:01:17.670> at<00:01:17.880> that

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
really accelerate don't just jog at that

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.539 
really accelerate don't just jog at that
point<00:01:18.270> even<00:01:18.869> if<00:01:18.960> it's<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.229> very<00:01:19.259> small<00:01:19.650> burst<00:01:20.280> I

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
point even if it's a very small burst I

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.600 
point even if it's a very small burst I
need<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.939> see<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.210> change<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.869> speed<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:23.009> imagine

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
need to see a change of speed to imagine

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.330 
need to see a change of speed to imagine
a<00:01:23.729> replicate<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.750> game<00:01:25.020> situation<00:01:25.830> where

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
a replicate the game situation where

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.450 
a replicate the game situation where
you're<00:01:26.430> getting<00:01:26.670> away<00:01:27.330> from<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.840> defender<00:01:28.460> it's

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
you're getting away from a defender it's

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.790 
you're getting away from a defender it's
not<00:01:30.770> free

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800
