my<00:06:30.539> time<00:06:30.870> and<00:06:31.039> just<00:06:32.039> kept<00:06:32.190> my<00:06:32.310> eyes<00:06:32.460> on<00:06:32.490> him<00:06:32.849> all

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:32.969 
my time and just kept my eyes on him all

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:34.040 
my time and just kept my eyes on him all
the<00:06:33.029> time<00:06:33.210> instead<00:06:33.419> of<00:06:33.599> trying<00:06:33.750> to<00:06:33.779> look<00:06:33.960> up

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
the time instead of trying to look up

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.620 
the time instead of trying to look up
early<00:06:34.380> that<00:06:34.560> was<00:06:35.190> a<00:06:35.250> great<00:06:35.580> great<00:06:36.029> competition
