00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.639
 thank you very kind and good standard we are going to 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.940
 keep learning to make a bike 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.470
 to organize a beautiful 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.890
 microenterprise so we have today 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.380
 the embroidered hoops ie it is the first 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.710
 step of how to start us in embroidery 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.769
 of hoops in this case is a pendant ring 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.650
 very simple and a clip ring a little more 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:35.370
 sumptuous is very simple girls look 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.980
 let's start with a ring base the 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.530
 can see is a base of hoop clips with 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.920
 some little holes where we're going to 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.730
 start to approach the crystals always 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.310
 in the company of a copper wire is 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.480
 I add in the one that happened for the two 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:58.290
 holes in the tip see how 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.800
 I threaded and now I just start 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:04.170
 place different crystals in shades 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.110
 that you please them so much 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:10.350
 slowly we are threading crystals 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.820
 try not to work with crystals of 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.880
 same size because 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.700
 if it does not remain very monotonous, it is not very 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.670
 cute and go adding two 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.570
 crystals simply n bramos from above 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:28.770
 from below up and let's move on 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:32.640
 towards a little hole below there is 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:36.150
 see the idea is to cover all this base of 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.720
 hoop with crystals we add another one in 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.540
 this case are glass donuts remember 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.700
 that in poseidÃ³n and neptuno have all 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.509
 the crystals to work in 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.300
 accessories at a very reasonable price and 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.030
 a variety of colors beautifully 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:58.710
 everything for brides for godmothers see that 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:01.500
 I'm covering the base of the hoop so 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.750
 that completely covers the base I 'm going 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:08.940
 to show in a little bit a little more 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:12.959
 advanced how I'm going to work if I like that 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:17.390
 little I'm covering the entire ring until the 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:21.530
 base simply finish and they will get 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:25.700
 the hoop with the wires in the part of 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:28.490
 back very well crossed very very little 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.360
 we just bake at the end and the hoop 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.450
 it's a baguette ring 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.240
 This and the ring is very finished 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.060
 for a very special occasion if it is 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.459
 very simple to do and we go for another 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.459
 which is also more than easy 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:45.110
 this is a watermarked filigree base 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.760
 girls always stay when they go 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.010
 working some filigree of some 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.800
 I 'll let them stay then we're going to 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.540
 add to them the turquoises that good 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.600
 Can you tell me the truth is a stone that 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.690
 They really like natural stones and 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.480
 these are turquoise steps it 's street 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.090
 is the small stone the step is a 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.670
 stone a little bigger we do 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:11.720
 we are simply going upwards 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:14.310
 any slot like that in half 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.500
 of the hoop 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:20.180
 and we are going to place the stones in the 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:23.190
 center just like that they all come 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.240
 perforated of different sizes 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.180
 then place two or three 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.810
 stones 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.480
 A) Yes 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.910
 and they will go back to pass the wire 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.590
 down 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.950
 A) Yes 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.849
 that's how they're going to do 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.890
 enough of the juniper I'm going 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:48.830
 down up until I cover the 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:53.569
 amount that I want from work if I eat 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:55.610
 let's stay like this and I'll observe 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.860
 this is important the wires towards 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.540
 up because because I have to 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.489
 close up because down 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:06.380
 they are going to puncture me the earlobe 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:10.879
 As I finish, I turn there, I turn the 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:15.140
 piece and I'm going very slowly and so 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:20.450
 with a clamp plier short the surplus 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:23.660
 and he turned the piece inside and 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:26.330
 dissimulation with the different stones that 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.010
 it remains to put simply the small 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.950
 ganchito will be seen here in the 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:34.370
 finished a small hook for hoops 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:36.950
 it's very simple and the hoop is finished 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.290
 with the colors you want with the 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:42.200
 stones that want with small pearls 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:44.210
 are few things that we can have 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.710
 other collars works he's going to 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.590
 look fantastic 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:51.110
 they're going to make sure they're going to do it 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.810
