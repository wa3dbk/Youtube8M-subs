00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.770
 Yes 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:10.350
 Here is 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.350
 Though it is adjustment gauge which performs clutch adjustment 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:19.630
 By the way this is a clutch booster 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:24.060
 Though there is a challenge rainbow here 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.060
 Clutch adjustment uses this adjustment screw 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:31.010
 It is put out and it is withdrawn 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.010
 Adjust the clutch 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:40.530
 First, it is the time play of that clutch is small 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:44.090
 Required when the clutch is connected by above 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.090
 I will take out this screw 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:50.610
 On the contrary in 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:58.220
 When there is a lot of clutch play 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:58.220
 Requirements will continue when the clutch is Shimotezuna retract the screw 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.530
 First of all 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.750
 It is time when there is little play of the clutch 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.990
 Required when the clutch is engaged will 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.770
 Is taking out this screw though 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.210
 How to put out 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:17.479
 At first we loose this 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.479
 is not it 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.240
 I usually end up in this state but 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.940
 can enter 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.310
 Though it was dreaming to see now 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.920
 so 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.799
 This root 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.799
 It is natto 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.150
 Though there is congratulation natto 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.719
 I will turn this nut 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:03.799
 Screw in 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.799
 Masu regularly stretched It is distinguished service in soup 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.189
 Just this last minute only for natto 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:17.760
 Well there is about 1mm loose just before the day 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.760
 And the time being 1 traveling-bridge 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:36.420
 with this 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.420
 This screw has been extended 1 b 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.430
 It is only that part- 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.530
 Clutch 's 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:52.240
 There was little play 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:57.330
 The clutch has become a little more important 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:03:00.810
 That was connected above in now leads a little 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:05.459
 It is next reverse yeah 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.770
 I like when the play of the clutch often is when there Shimoyama clutch is the 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:13.100
 Oh 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:15.610
 This does not go not to reduce the play of the clutch slightly because different charcoal often 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:20.730
 That time is it 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.730
 We're going to put reduced to this adjustment screw large reverse 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.860
 At that time 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:28.970
 Just before time j 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.970
 It this is the root of 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.030
 this 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.030
 Root rat 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.760
 Turn it the other way around 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:51.590
 I will retract this adjustment screw 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.590
 I will continue to shorten 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.970
 As we extended 1 mm earlier 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.860
 Then 1 mm 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.860
 Shorten the ear to this adjustment 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.930
 Main is going to loosen and Sakura 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:32.340
 I think I will come to see it in a video 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:35.150
 Roughly the screw can about this Department of 1 mm 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.150
 Since the gap is empty 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.470
 I will tighten this time 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.110
 Yes 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.990
 It looks like this 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:50.849
 Clutch adjustment 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:53.370
 Extend or retract this adjustment screw 

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:56.900
 Depending on things like that 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.900
 Make this latch adjustment 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:02.750
 Yes it is more than 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.750
 Thank you very much
