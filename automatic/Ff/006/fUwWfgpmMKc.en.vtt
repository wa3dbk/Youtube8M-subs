out<00:01:52.940> of<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:53.210> way<00:01:53.390> because<00:01:53.570> you<00:01:53.810> don't<00:01:54.020> want<00:01:54.260> to

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
the top of the feathers so that they're

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.610 
the top of the feathers so that they're
not<00:01:59.600> sticking<00:01:59.960> out<00:02:00.380> of<00:02:00.530> the<00:02:00.650> top<00:02:00.890> 43<00:02:01.610> and<00:02:02.620> there

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
not sticking out of the top 43 and there

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.190 
not sticking out of the top 43 and there
you<00:02:03.860> have<00:02:03.890> it<00:02:04.280> you<00:02:04.729> have<00:02:04.910> the<00:02:05.120> first<00:02:05.390> part<00:02:05.720> done

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
you have it you have the first part done

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.040 
you have it you have the first part done
to<00:02:07.190> get<00:02:07.340> ready<00:02:07.580> to<00:02:07.880> put<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.390> feathers<00:02:08.690> into

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
to get ready to put the feathers into

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:19.560 
to get ready to put the feathers into
your<00:02:09.200> beef

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.710 

okay<00:02:20.570> so<00:02:21.260> the<00:02:21.680> next<00:02:21.890> step<00:02:22.160> would<00:02:22.340> be<00:02:22.400> to<00:02:22.730> be

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
okay so the next step would be to be

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.980 
okay so the next step would be to be
drawer<00:02:24.230> feathers<00:02:24.830> you<00:02:25.370> want<00:02:25.640> to<00:02:25.820> put<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.570> big

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
drawer feathers you want to put the big

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.260 
drawer feathers you want to put the big
be<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.830> big<00:02:28.010> opening<00:02:28.430> of<00:02:28.580> the<00:02:28.670> bead<00:02:28.850> through

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
be the big opening of the bead through

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.650 
be the big opening of the bead through
and<00:02:29.540> slide<00:02:30.140> your<00:02:30.170> feathers<00:02:31.130> through<00:02:31.580> and<00:02:31.880> see

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
and slide your feathers through and see

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.300 
and slide your feathers through and see
if<00:02:32.750> that<00:02:32.930> looks<00:02:33.200> good<00:02:33.530> and<00:02:33.830> I<00:02:33.950> think<00:02:34.010> that

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
if that looks good and I think that

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.460 
if that looks good and I think that
looks<00:02:34.490> very<00:02:34.640> good<00:02:34.790> so<00:02:35.480> then<00:02:35.630> you<00:02:35.780> just<00:02:36.200> pull<00:02:36.440> it

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
looks very good so then you just pull it

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.600 
looks very good so then you just pull it
