 within the products that you can 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:10.070
 find in the market to feed 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:11.630
 your dog or cat are the food 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.879
 elaborated under the regulations of 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.860
 feeding pet animals that 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:18.650
 They are generally feed and cans of 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.900
 wet food and moreover the 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.450
 high quality foods that are the 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.740
 dehydrated at low temperature 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.450
 made in food factories to 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.850
 and under the regulations of 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.220
 human nutrition we explain the 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.200
 difference food processing 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.059
 for pets works through a 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.620
 system of the withdrawal of 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.690
 by - products of human nutrition 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.370
 that is to say that we are giving to our 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.579
 dogs and cats the debris that 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.440
 we generate people this includes the 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.270
 works that come out of the slaughterhouses after 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.700
 to separate all parts of the animal 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.030
 which are for human consumption bones 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.100
 carcasses skins guts legs or heads u 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.230
 other ingredients that for the reason that 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.030
 it would not pass an inspection and they are 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.980
 declared as unfit for consumption 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.760
 human are used to feed 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.760
 our animals 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.420
 the fish industry could feed for 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.310
 pets get that as per art of 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.810
 magic to all these by-products that from 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.360
 otherwise they would have to go to the trash 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.210
 when your dog and your cat eat them 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.060
 become profit that is to say in 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.320
 money for example you can buy a 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.440
 sack of feed in a clinic 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.090
 veterinary for a price of 87 euros at 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.340
 look at the list of ingredients you read 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.100
 the next 20 percent meat of 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.410
 chicken corn wheat fat animals apple 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.630
 pear pumpkin beet pulp eggs 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.030
 Preservatives and authorized colorants 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.310
 for the European Union 'good 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.300
 apparently it is not a bad diet but 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.910
 let's see what is true in this 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.640
 Actually when you remove the water is 20 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:51.730
 percent of chicken is reduced to 7 2% 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.340
 but what is even worse is that that 7 with 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.560
 2% remaining chicken can be heads 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.400
 legs and carcasses not the meat that you 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.400
 you were imagining 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.490
 fruits and vegetables and cereals can 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.649
 be the remains that come out of any 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.899
 factory that use these products as 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.910
 the beet pulp present in many 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.500
 feed that is nothing more than the waste that 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.600
 it remains after squeezing the beet 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.520
 to get the sugar 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.350
 the fear that the ingredients are 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.120
 contaminated and the process itself to 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.770
 make the balls of feed brings them to 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.080
 the manufacturers to use high 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.760
 temperatures what they do not tell us is 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.250
 that this in addition to killing possible 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.480
 pathogens like bacteria and parasites 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.460
 it also kills much of the value 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.970
 Nutritional food including 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:36.070
 vitamins and essential amino acids but 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.200
 why would your dog or cat want to eat 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.480
 this in the manufacturing process 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.980
 after grinding the ingredients 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.890
 gives them a fat bath that makes it more 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.100
 appetizing as these fats are in 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.410
 rancid very easily need to use 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.330
 preservatives among the preservatives that 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.980
 we can find is in the hiv 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.930
 hiv tea or toxin 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.159
 Many dogs are allergic to 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.230
 foods that contain preservatives 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:02.390
 chemicals and have chronic symptoms 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.510
 as the excess of itching diarrheas 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.709
 usual or just upset 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.680
 problems that will remain there while not 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:12.110
 chemical substances are withdrawn 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.640
 how much is all this really very little 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.560
 but a lack of information and a 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.620
 brilliant marketing have gotten that 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.150
 you pay 87 euros for buying it you see 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.530
 that not for paying a lot of money you're 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.599
 giving a good food to your dog or cat 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.720
 but those who may be paying a 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:28.760
 very expensive price are our animals a 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.290
 recent scientific study talks about the 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.000
 high rates of cancer increase 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.799
 bone in dogs and cats that are 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.440
 related to the fluorine in the 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:38.870
 animal byproducts other studies 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.480
 suggest that 74.7 percent of 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.040
 common diseases in dogs and 63 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.720
 percent of common diseases 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.670
 cats can be eliminated without 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.739
 medical intervention in a period of one 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.769
 year only through a correct 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.720
 food on the other hand there are 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.700
 food for dogs and cats like naku 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.400
 which are based on the regulations of 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.109
 the difference human consumption 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.100
 quality controls the requirements 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:03.050
 health 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.620
 and remember the by-products that 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:08.989
 we talked before they are all banned 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.180
 We know that your body needs food 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.700
 fresh quality and varied meat 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.140
 fish fruit vegetable food 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.530
 fresh contain the ingredient 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:20.660
 fundamental life possess enzymes 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.729
 natural probiotic antioxidants 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.860
 vitamins and minerals in your state 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:27.790
 natural and it is impossible to find this 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.770
 inside a dry ball of feed 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.230
 The manufacturing process has been the 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.610
 dehydration at low temperature 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.130
 slowly baking ingredients 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.630
 to eliminate the water because they are 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.490
 quality ingredients since they have 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.040
 had a minimal processing is not 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.480
 necessary to use animal fats 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.490
 preservative dyes or any other 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.889
 chemical additive 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.690
 the ingredients look smelly and 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:52.360
 recover their original texture once 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.460
 rehydrated a recent study 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.990
 concluded that 78 percent of the 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.419
 animals that are passed on to this type of 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:01.539
 food improve your skin problems and 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:03.940
 hairs related to allergies 82% 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:05.500
 improves its digestion and 61 percent 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:09.220
 of the owners believes that this food 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:11.320
 can lengthen the life of your dog or cat 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.190
 this type of food is developed 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.190
 to meet the needs 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.930
 nutrition of your dog or cat yes 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.180
 remember we are talking about food 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.770
 fresh and that as such can be mixed 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.340
 with other fresh ingredients that 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.480
 have at home meat fruits vegetables 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.680
 remember that the ingredients of nagqu 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.680
 are suitable for human consumption 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.270
 for the quality and digestibility of the 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.010
 ingredients of na q the ration that you should 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.440
 give your dog or cat is less than in 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:43.210
 the rest of the food but when mixed 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.980
 with water and recover its natural moisture 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.670
 what is not going to happen to you is that 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.670
 be hungry 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:56.850
 because a more honest sale more 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.850
 smart and more social is possible
