the latest version of Android here is

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.670 
the latest version of Android here is
the<00:02:14.850> nexus<00:02:15.090> 4<00:02:15.300> lying<00:02:15.510> right<00:02:15.720> beside<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:16.080> FM<00:02:16.260> 4s

the nexus 4 lying right beside the FM 4s

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.290 
the nexus 4 lying right beside the FM 4s
so<00:02:16.980> you<00:02:17.070> can<00:02:17.190> get<00:02:17.310> a<00:02:17.370> feel<00:02:17.580> of<00:02:17.640> how<00:02:17.760> big<00:02:18.180> the

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
so you can get a feel of how big the

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.210 
so you can get a feel of how big the
devices<00:02:18.720> it's<00:02:19.410> not<00:02:19.500> very<00:02:19.620> wide<00:02:19.860> so<00:02:20.010> you'll<00:02:20.130> be

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
devices it's not very wide so you'll be

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.940 
devices it's not very wide so you'll be
able<00:02:20.250> to<00:02:20.430> completely<00:02:20.730> hold<00:02:21.090> in<00:02:21.300> your<00:02:21.330> hand<00:02:21.600> and

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.020 
able to completely hold in your hand and
here<00:02:22.950> we<00:02:22.980> have<00:02:23.070> a<00:02:23.190> comparison<00:02:23.580> of<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:23.790> device

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
here we have a comparison of the device

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.670 
here we have a comparison of the device
with<00:02:24.270> the<00:02:24.300> f-4s<00:02:24.810> in<00:02:24.930> terms<00:02:25.080> of<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.410> slimness

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
with the f-4s in terms of the slimness

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.950 
with the f-4s in terms of the slimness
so<00:02:26.070> this<00:02:26.700> device<00:02:26.970> are<00:02:27.150> very<00:02:27.360> close<00:02:27.570> to<00:02:27.930> each

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
so this device are very close to each

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.720 
so this device are very close to each
other<00:02:28.200> when<00:02:28.380> it<00:02:28.500> comes<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.160> thickness<00:02:29.550> and

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
other when it comes to the thickness and

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.820 
other when it comes to the thickness and
the<00:02:30.630> next<00:02:30.810> four<00:02:30.990> is<00:02:31.110> only<00:02:31.230> slimmer<00:02:31.530> by<00:02:31.680> about

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
the next four is only slimmer by about

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.630 
the next four is only slimmer by about
0.02<00:02:32.670> millimeters<00:02:33.980> now<00:02:34.980> if<00:02:35.160> you<00:02:35.250> compared<00:02:35.550> to

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
0.02 millimeters now if you compared to

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.460 
0.02 millimeters now if you compared to
the<00:02:35.730> iphone<00:02:35.820> 5<00:02:36.240> you<00:02:36.450> can<00:02:36.570> obviously<00:02:36.660> tell<00:02:37.170> that

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
the iphone 5 you can obviously tell that

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.740 
the iphone 5 you can obviously tell that
the<00:02:37.590> nexus<00:02:37.980> 4<00:02:38.250> is<00:02:38.430> again<00:02:38.820> very<00:02:38.970> large<00:02:39.360> because

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
the nexus 4 is again very large because

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.180 
the nexus 4 is again very large because
the<00:02:39.930> four<00:02:40.080> point<00:02:40.260> eight<00:02:40.440> inch<00:02:40.710> display<00:02:41.070> that

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
the four point eight inch display that

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.970 
the four point eight inch display that
has<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.580> 720p<00:02:42.060> HD<00:02:42.300> display<00:02:42.600> but<00:02:43.320> the<00:02:43.530> iphone<00:02:43.770> 5

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
has the 720p HD display but the iphone 5

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.270 
has the 720p HD display but the iphone 5
is<00:02:44.220> a<00:02:44.280> lot<00:02:44.700> slimmer<00:02:45.030> than<00:02:45.180> gaining<00:02:45.450> support<00:02:46.280> so

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
is a lot slimmer than gaining support so

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.980 
is a lot slimmer than gaining support so
