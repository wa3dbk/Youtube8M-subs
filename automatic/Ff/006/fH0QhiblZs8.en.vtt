00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.050
 hello girls welcome back just 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.689
 arrived in the wardrobe and then maybe 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:26.349
 I lived my coffee of the day one of the 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:28.270
 I already have so many with you 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.529
 organized since yesterday with the baby that 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.680
 so tonight we go for an aperitif 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:35.230
 all together and so I thought a lot 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.670
 I go into the wardrobe and work I will have 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.260
 I certainly take very late 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.079
 the car and I reach for where I am already 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.699
 prepared for the evening and what 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.339
 recommended for the aperitif well it depends 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:46.719
 in the sense that it also depends on the type 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:48.879
 you are in the office then 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:50.559
 from the type of shoe you have at most 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.719
 if you are for the shoe what puts you 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:53.890
 all so preferred the heel for 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:56.050
 the aperitif 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.879
 however I have adopted a solution of 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.000
 this type in the mini dress sense that 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:04.360
 I love it because it is very colorful a lot 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.460
 summer in addition , I assure you that in strÃ  

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.080
 trend if we can say so I know that not 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.380
 It is that we can say, however straten of enza 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.210
 to these flying on the sleeves they are 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.850
 they give this sense of lightness 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.220
 speed and fun idea all but of 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.599
 seasons with a chloe on the catwalk 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.720
 of spring summer he proposed them to us 

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:25.000
 in very light variants as well as gucci 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.619
 it was all a story of long dresses 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.810
 bright and vivid colors with 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:32.289
 these flies if you don't have them 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.119
 want to show the legs but of 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:35.979
 you can stay a little more composed too 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.289
 go to the office if you want to change 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:41.200
 even later with jeans like 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:43.959
 this one is very simple in this 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.179
 case embellished with swarovski and dvd 's 

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:47.890
 crystal stones if you do n't have them that 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:51.160
 which is not important in the sense it is 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.950
 just a hint more but you can 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.979
 live even without an indication vi 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.390
 please listen to this I know you can 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.420
 be difficult to get into this 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.439
 this mode 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.420
 thought but prefer wedges from 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.610
 match with flared jeans and not on the list 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.440
 how rather than know them we say that 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.239
 par excellence the shoe that yes 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.840
 should wear under the paw of the 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.220
 zappa gaza like this a chestnut 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.140
 I think you have it too 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.819
 really in the closet are gods 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.620
 passepartout there are all the seasons 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.110
 in different variants like this one for 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.880
 example that matches the canvas to the skin 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.430
 so there is a contrast of materials 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.099
 otherwise I find super elegant instead 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.010
 the sandal with the heel covered in 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.840
 leather and the lawn instead of wood that goes 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.530
 great with any denim color 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.850
 and then we combine a sorry not blouse 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.720
 she let herself be infected by this 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:47.930
 print that I find wonderful I do a little 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.540
 of slaughterhouses but a blouse like this one 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.060
 you don't want the dress always zapata with 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:57.530
 the nicolai marks on the sleeves to which there is 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:59.630
 match a shoulder bag like this type 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.019
 postina are called this way in 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.760
 skin and if instead just come back 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.890
 from the office because you have everything working 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.260
 so the day has been going straight 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.820
 at your aperitif maybe you have the 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.709
 your shopping as in this case 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.420
 this, however, and leather that incorporates the 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.420
 sandals now are not of the opinion that yes 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.950
 must coordinate always escapes and and leads 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.810
 but let's say every now and then and there 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.180
 they are poetic sciences in this 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.530
 case it can be done and inside 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.560
 maybe you have already put yours there 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:31.370
 little as in this case in print 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:35.299
 python and leather to combine with jeans and 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.140
 I find it special and then again 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:38.989
 Sun glasses 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:42.109
 I would say that at that point we go to do 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:44.530
 aperitifs no hello girls tomorrow 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:44.530
