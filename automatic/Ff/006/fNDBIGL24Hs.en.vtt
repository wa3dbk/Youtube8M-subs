line-by-line

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.920 
line-by-line
this<00:00:43.620> is<00:00:43.770> really<00:00:44.129> simple<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.610> use<00:00:44.899> we're<00:00:45.899> going

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
this is really simple to use we're going

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.229 
this is really simple to use we're going
to<00:00:46.079> start<00:00:46.320> with<00:00:46.410> present<00:00:46.860> value<00:00:47.190> it's<00:00:47.879> always

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
to start with present value it's always

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.970 
to start with present value it's always
a<00:00:48.270> negative<00:00:48.539> number<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.260> it's<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.620> current

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
a negative number and it's the current

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.569 
a negative number and it's the current
value<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.370> your<00:00:50.550> debt<00:00:50.910> so<00:00:51.210> let's<00:00:51.390> fast<00:00:51.600> forward

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
value of your debt so let's fast forward

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.779 
value of your debt so let's fast forward
medical<00:00:53.579> schools<00:00:53.820> over<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.420> you've<00:00:54.899> got

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
medical schools over and you've got

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.250 
medical schools over and you've got
three<00:00:56.789> hundred<00:00:57.000> thousand<00:00:57.570> dollars<00:00:57.870> in<00:00:58.050> debt

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
three hundred thousand dollars in debt

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.510 
three hundred thousand dollars in debt
and<00:01:00.379> again<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:01.530> type<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:01.800> in<00:01:02.100> as<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.280> negative

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
and again you type that in as a negative

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.490 
and again you type that in as a negative
number<00:01:02.879> because<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.600> bank<00:01:03.840> has<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.290> money

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
number because the bank has that money

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.630 
number because the bank has that money
not<00:01:04.799> yourself<00:01:05.600> and<00:01:06.600> then<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:08.040> future<00:01:08.460> value

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
not yourself and then the future value

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.870 
not yourself and then the future value
is<00:01:08.939> what<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.960> want<00:01:10.260> this<00:01:10.590> bank<00:01:11.310> account<00:01:11.460> to

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
is what you want this bank account to

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.760 
is what you want this bank account to
read<00:01:12.119> after<00:01:12.510> you've<00:01:12.630> paid<00:01:12.869> your<00:01:12.900> loans<00:01:13.290> off<00:01:13.500> so

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
read after you've paid your loans off so

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.340 
read after you've paid your loans off so
that's<00:01:13.920> zero<00:01:14.580> dollars<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.930> number<00:01:16.229> of

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
that's zero dollars and the number of

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.200 
that's zero dollars and the number of
payments<00:01:16.650> is<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.189> total<00:01:17.580> number<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:17.880> payments

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
payments is the total number of payments

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.609 
payments is the total number of payments
you're<00:01:18.509> going<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.750> make<00:01:18.900> over<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.380> lifetime

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
you're going to make over the lifetime

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.830 
you're going to make over the lifetime
of<00:01:19.920> your<00:01:20.130> loan<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.270> make<00:01:21.540> monthly

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
of your loan so you make monthly

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.990 
of your loan so you make monthly
payments<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.650> if<00:01:22.770> you're<00:01:22.950> doing<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.520> 10-year

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
payments and if you're doing a 10-year

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.710 
payments and if you're doing a 10-year
loan<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.900> would<00:01:25.110> be<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.530> hundred<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.130> twenty

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
loan that would be a hundred and twenty

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.980 
loan that would be a hundred and twenty
payments<00:01:27.720> over<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.320> whole<00:01:28.640> term<00:01:29.720> we<00:01:30.720> don't

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
payments over the whole term we don't

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.480 
payments over the whole term we don't
know<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.380> payment<00:01:31.770> amounts<00:01:32.159> that's

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
know the payment amounts that's

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.950 
know the payment amounts that's
obviously<00:01:33.119> what<00:01:33.360> we're<00:01:33.509> looking<00:01:33.810> to

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
obviously what we're looking to

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.050 
obviously what we're looking to
calculate<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.710> then<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.430> interest<00:01:35.820> rate

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
calculate and then the interest rate

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.700 
calculate and then the interest rate
essentially<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:36.780> take<00:01:36.990> your<00:01:37.170> interest<00:01:37.500> rate

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
essentially you take your interest rate

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.609 
essentially you take your interest rate
and<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.189> divide<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.640> by<00:01:38.790> 12<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.930> describes<00:01:40.470> it

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
and you divide it by 12 it describes it

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.620 
and you divide it by 12 it describes it
really<00:01:40.890> well<00:01:41.100> just<00:01:41.430> underneath<00:01:42.060> this<00:01:42.299> in<00:01:42.509> this

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
really well just underneath this in this

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.060 
really well just underneath this in this
text<00:01:42.990> down<00:01:43.140> here<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.649> one<00:01:43.770> on<00:01:43.950> the

and<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.520> half<00:01:47.549> percent<00:01:48.290> loan<00:01:49.790> divided<00:01:50.790> by

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
and a half percent loan divided by

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.590 
and a half percent loan divided by
twelve<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.780> number<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.170> 0.5<00:01:52.979> for<00:01:53.310> one<00:01:53.610> so

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
twelve and that number is 0.5 for one so

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.569 
twelve and that number is 0.5 for one so
we'll<00:01:54.780> put<00:01:54.960> point<00:01:55.259> five<00:01:55.560> for<00:01:55.950> one<00:01:56.159> in<00:01:56.369> there

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
we'll put point five for one in there

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.230 
we'll put point five for one in there
and<00:01:56.820> then<00:01:56.880> we<00:01:57.869> click<00:01:58.590> on<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.979> payment<00:01:59.460> button

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
and then we click on the payment button

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.569 
and then we click on the payment button
here<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:01.200> tells<00:02:01.500> us<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.979> if<00:02:02.430> we're

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
here and that tells us that if we're

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.490 
here and that tells us that if we're
going<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.790> pay<00:02:02.880> this<00:02:03.030> loan<00:02:03.090> off<00:02:03.540> in<00:02:03.750> ten<00:02:03.990> years

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
going to pay this loan off in ten years

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.560 
going to pay this loan off in ten years
we<00:02:04.799> make<00:02:05.009> payments<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.640> three<00:02:05.880> thousand<00:02:06.390> four

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
we make payments of three thousand four

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.969 
we make payments of three thousand four
hundred<00:02:06.719> dollars<00:02:07.170> every<00:02:07.439> month

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
hundred dollars every month

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.830 
hundred dollars every month
okay<00:02:08.910> now<00:02:09.800> earlier<00:02:10.800> I<00:02:10.890> mentioned<00:02:11.270> how<00:02:12.270> the

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
okay now earlier I mentioned how the

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.970 
okay now earlier I mentioned how the
financial<00:02:13.200> planner<00:02:13.560> I<00:02:13.650> suppose

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
financial planner I suppose

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.940 
financial planner I suppose
to<00:02:14.159> recommended<00:02:14.790> refinancing<00:02:15.690> for<00:02:16.409> a<00:02:16.440> 30<00:02:16.709> year

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
to recommended refinancing for a 30 year

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.339 
to recommended refinancing for a 30 year
loan<00:02:17.159> so<00:02:17.849> let's<00:02:18.090> just<00:02:18.330> look<00:02:18.720> at<00:02:18.870> what<00:02:19.080> it<00:02:19.170> would

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
loan so let's just look at what it would

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:24.680 
loan so let's just look at what it would
be<00:02:19.680> if<00:02:19.890> we<00:02:20.400> were<00:02:20.549> to<00:02:20.730> make<00:02:20.940> a<00:02:21.799> total<00:02:22.799> of<00:02:23.690> 360

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
be if we were to make a total of 360

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.350 
be if we were to make a total of 360
payments<00:02:24.930> so<00:02:25.830> that's<00:02:26.040> obviously<00:02:26.400> 12<00:02:27.060> payments

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
payments so that's obviously 12 payments

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.369 
payments so that's obviously 12 payments
a<00:02:27.629> year<00:02:27.930> times<00:02:28.530> 30<00:02:28.830> years<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.989> then<00:02:30.989> we<00:02:31.230> would

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
a year times 30 years and then we would

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.170 
a year times 30 years and then we would
just<00:02:31.440> make<00:02:31.860> that<00:02:32.010> one<00:02:32.280> adjustment<00:02:32.580> here<00:02:33.060> on

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
just make that one adjustment here on

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.750 
just make that one adjustment here on
that<00:02:33.330> line<00:02:33.599> would<00:02:34.019> reclick<00:02:34.530> payment<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.190> now

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
that line would reclick payment and now

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.440 
that line would reclick payment and now
our<00:02:35.940> payment<00:02:36.360> is<00:02:36.510> cut<00:02:37.140> in<00:02:37.230> half<00:02:37.370> so<00:02:38.370> that's<00:02:38.580> a

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
our payment is cut in half so that's a

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.080 
our payment is cut in half so that's a
pretty<00:02:40.379> easy<00:02:40.500> way<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:41.069> use<00:02:41.340> a<00:02:41.489> financial

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
pretty easy way to use a financial

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.210 
pretty easy way to use a financial
calculator<00:02:42.269> you<00:02:43.170> can<00:02:43.319> do<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.560> exact<00:02:44.099> same
