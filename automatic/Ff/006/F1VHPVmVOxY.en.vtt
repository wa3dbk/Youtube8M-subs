00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.310 

I<00:00:09.769> think<00:00:10.769> drones<00:00:11.400> are<00:00:11.610> here<00:00:11.730> to<00:00:11.820> stay

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.320 
I think drones are here to stay

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.539 
I think drones are here to stay
we're<00:00:13.320> going<00:00:13.530> to<00:00:13.620> use<00:00:13.769> them<00:00:13.950> we<00:00:14.099> need<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.309> use

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
we're going to use them we need to use

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:15.650 
we're going to use them we need to use
them<00:00:14.700> and<00:00:14.849> they're<00:00:14.940> important<00:00:15.330> part<00:00:15.509> of<00:00:15.540> what

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
them and they're important part of what

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.849 
them and they're important part of what
we<00:00:15.750> do<00:00:15.839> I'm<00:00:15.990> actually<00:00:16.109> going<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.440> use<00:00:16.710> them

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
we do I'm actually going to use them

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.420 
we do I'm actually going to use them
even<00:00:16.980> more<00:00:17.960> so<00:00:18.960> I<00:00:19.350> think<00:00:19.590> that's<00:00:19.980> important

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
even more so I think that's important

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.880 
even more so I think that's important
but<00:00:20.670> they<00:00:20.850> are<00:00:20.880> different<00:00:21.630> they're<00:00:22.560> different

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
but they are different they're different

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.089 
but they are different they're different
because<00:00:23.369> they<00:00:23.550> are<00:00:23.670> perceived<00:00:23.939> differently

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:25.099 
because they are perceived differently

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:27.830 
because they are perceived differently
now<00:00:26.099> if<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.369> think<00:00:26.580> about<00:00:26.820> it<00:00:27.029> there<00:00:27.810> are

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
now if you think about it there are

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.019 
now if you think about it there are
several<00:00:28.199> factors<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.039> first<00:00:29.279> is<00:00:29.550> go<00:00:29.849> back

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
several factors is the first is go back

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.089 
several factors is the first is go back
to<00:00:30.179> 1988<00:00:30.810> anybody<00:00:31.289> remember<00:00:31.679> what<00:00:31.769> happened

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
to 1988 anybody remember what happened

1988<00:00:36.320> that's<00:00:37.320> very<00:00:37.590> sad

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590

were at war what would we have said no
we're<00:01:04.680> not<00:01:04.710> at<00:01:04.920> war<00:01:05.070> we<00:01:05.280> fired<00:01:05.519> some<00:01:05.729> time-off

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
we're not at war we fired some time-off

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.080 
we're not at war we fired some time-off
missiles<00:01:06.680> if<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:08.010> were<00:01:08.189> near<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.610> impact

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
missiles if you were near the impact

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.730 
missiles if you were near the impact

point of a Tomahawk missile and you

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.050 
point of a Tomahawk missile and you
asked<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.130> next<00:01:11.340> morning<00:01:11.610> if<00:01:11.700> they<00:01:11.820> were<00:01:11.880> at

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
asked the next morning if they were at

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.640 
asked the next morning if they were at
war<00:01:12.210> with<00:01:12.270> America<00:01:12.510> what<00:01:13.320> do<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.470> think

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
war with America what do you think

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.580 
war with America what do you think
they'd<00:01:13.799> say<00:01:14.630> the<00:01:15.630> answer<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:15.930> probably

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
they'd say the answer is probably

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.940 
they'd say the answer is probably
different<00:01:17.090> so<00:01:18.090> if<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.630> lowers<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.380> threshold

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
different so if it lowers the threshold

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.249 
different so if it lowers the threshold
on<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.189> use<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.640> military<00:01:20.759> force<00:01:21.259> it's

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
on the use of military force it's

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.550 
on the use of military force it's
dangerous<00:01:22.909> and<00:01:23.909> what<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:24.150> mean<00:01:24.420> if<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.750> can<00:01:25.439> be

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
dangerous and what I mean if it can be

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.920 
dangerous and what I mean if it can be
too<00:01:25.799> casual<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.840> can<00:01:27.840> seem<00:01:28.170> too<00:01:28.560> easy<00:01:28.880> too

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
too casual it can seem too easy too

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.719 
too casual it can seem too easy too
inexpensive<00:01:30.930> too<00:01:31.439> risk-free<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.280> it

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
inexpensive too risk-free and it

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.510 
inexpensive too risk-free and it
increases<00:01:33.150> your<00:01:33.450> likelihood<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.960> doing<00:01:34.350> it

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
increases your likelihood of doing it

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.130 
increases your likelihood of doing it
then<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.549> would<00:01:35.820> say<00:01:35.970> everyone<00:01:36.450> who<00:01:36.570> orders<00:01:36.930> one

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
then I would say everyone who orders one

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.069 
then I would say everyone who orders one
ought<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.530> go<00:01:37.650> stand<00:01:38.159> next<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:39.420> where<00:01:39.689> one<00:01:39.900> has

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
ought to go stand next to where one has

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.100 
ought to go stand next to where one has
gone<00:01:40.259> off<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:41.310> where<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.210> see<00:01:42.420> body<00:01:42.630> parts

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
gone off and where you see body parts

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.929 
gone off and where you see body parts
and<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.560> things<00:01:44.040> like<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.280> it's<00:01:44.579> very

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
and and things like that it's very

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.969 
and and things like that it's very
different<00:01:45.479> so<00:01:46.200> I'm<00:01:46.259> not<00:01:46.380> saying<00:01:46.619> what<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:46.770> use

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
different so I'm not saying what I use

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.499 
different so I'm not saying what I use
I'm<00:01:47.130> saying<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.759> got<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.030> make<00:01:48.149> sure<00:01:48.329> you

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
I'm saying you got to make sure you

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.050 
I'm saying you got to make sure you
understand<00:01:49.200> what<00:01:49.409> you're<00:01:49.560> doing<00:01:49.820> the<00:01:50.820> other

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
understand what you're doing the other

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.109 
understand what you're doing the other
part<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.630> is<00:01:51.840> perceptions<00:01:52.880> we've<00:01:53.880> got

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
part of it is perceptions we've got

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.090 
part of it is perceptions we've got
problems<00:01:54.390> with<00:01:54.780> some<00:01:55.049> Mexican<00:01:55.470> drug<00:01:55.680> lords<00:01:55.979> in

after<00:01:58.079> them<00:01:58.140> but<00:01:58.500> what<00:01:58.710> if<00:01:58.799> Mexico<00:01:58.979> flew

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
after them but what if Mexico flew

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.209 
after them but what if Mexico flew
across<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.790> border<00:02:00.259> with<00:02:01.259> drones<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.890> did<00:02:02.189> a

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
across the border with drones and did a

missile<00:02:02.579> strike<00:02:02.670> in<00:02:03.000> Texas<00:02:03.390> how<00:02:04.320> would<00:02:04.560> we

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
missile strike in Texas how would we
