a company that I like is that they've

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.080

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.940 
done a smart thing they have made the
bronze<00:01:41.299> are<00:01:41.479> the<00:01:41.540> biggest<00:01:41.720> the<00:01:42.439> highlight<00:01:42.799> of

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
bronze are the biggest the highlight of

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.920 
bronze are the biggest the highlight of
the<00:01:43.010> smallest<00:01:43.340> and<00:01:43.670> the<00:01:43.939> blusher<00:01:44.360> the<00:01:44.510> second

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
the smallest and the blusher the second

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.050 
the smallest and the blusher the second
largest<00:01:45.200> because<00:01:45.860> we<00:01:46.040> will<00:01:46.220> use<00:01:46.369> more<00:01:46.580> bronzer

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
largest because we will use more bronzer

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.480 
largest because we will use more bronzer
than<00:01:47.240> more<00:01:47.479> blusher<00:01:47.689> and<00:01:48.020> we<00:01:48.140> will<00:01:48.320> use<00:01:48.530> a<00:01:48.710> far

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
than more blusher and we will use a far

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.550 
than more blusher and we will use a far
less<00:01:49.759> highlighter<00:01:50.270> than<00:01:50.869> we<00:01:51.020> will<00:01:51.170> ever<00:01:51.380> use

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
less highlighter than we will ever use

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.469 
less highlighter than we will ever use
the<00:01:52.250> other<00:01:52.400> two<00:01:52.610> because<00:01:52.880> highlighter<00:01:53.330> is

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
the other two because highlighter is
