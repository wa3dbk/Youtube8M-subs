00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
like you didn't get as much footage for

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.340 
like you didn't get as much footage for
today<00:05:34.460> so<00:05:34.520> the<00:05:35.360> video<00:05:35.630> is<00:05:35.750> a<00:05:35.840> little<00:05:36.200> bit

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.350 
today so the video is a little bit

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:37.960 
today so the video is a little bit
shorter<00:05:36.680> I<00:05:36.860> promise<00:05:37.190> I'm<00:05:37.310> gonna<00:05:37.430> make<00:05:37.580> up<00:05:37.730> for

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
shorter I promise I'm gonna make up for

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.780 
shorter I promise I'm gonna make up for
it<00:05:38.090> tomorrow<00:05:39.190> because<00:05:40.190> one<00:05:40.370> of<00:05:40.460> the<00:05:40.550> things

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:40.790 
it tomorrow because one of the things

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.940 
it tomorrow because one of the things
that<00:05:41.000> I<00:05:41.030> found<00:05:41.360> is<00:05:41.720> kind<00:05:42.140> of<00:05:42.200> hard<00:05:42.440> is<00:05:42.710> that<00:05:42.920> a

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 
that I found is kind of hard is that a

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.340 
that I found is kind of hard is that a
lot<00:05:43.220> of<00:05:43.250> the<00:05:43.430> ballrooms<00:05:43.820> and<00:05:43.940> that<00:05:44.120> are<00:05:44.540> super

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:45.350 
lot of the ballrooms and that are super

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:47.140 
lot of the ballrooms and that are super
dark<00:05:45.500> so<00:05:45.860> it's<00:05:46.040> kind<00:05:46.310> of<00:05:46.370> hard<00:05:46.580> to<00:05:46.640> get<00:05:46.850> footage

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
dark so it's kind of hard to get footage

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.840 
dark so it's kind of hard to get footage
and<00:05:47.600> crazy<00:05:48.530> loud<00:05:48.920> so<00:05:49.250> it's<00:05:49.400> kind<00:05:49.580> of<00:05:49.610> hard<00:05:49.790> to

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:49.850 
and crazy loud so it's kind of hard to

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.660 
and crazy loud so it's kind of hard to
like<00:05:50.090> get<00:05:50.420> the<00:05:50.450> talk<00:05:51.380> to<00:05:51.560> people<00:05:51.740> videos<00:05:52.250> but
