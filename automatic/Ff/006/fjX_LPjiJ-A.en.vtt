00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:10.049
 hey I once again pleasurable to a 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.910
 something else maker tutorial and there 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:14.360
 I thought it would be fitting to show winter 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.230
 I give you my vision of a queen of ice 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.090
 Let's start 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.280
 I start with it my face and mine 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.080
 neck to paint completely with white paint 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.900
 all the products I use you will find 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:34.260
 By the way, in the infobox then I could 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:35.879
 something with a bright blue next 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.800
 I just powder everything first and 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:39.989
 reinforced spots with white 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.489
 Eyeshadow with a purple pigment go 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.440
 I now fold well far 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.679
 outside and also easy on the movable 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.780
 so I take it a purple mascara 

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:50.579
 and put it on my eyebrows 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.940
 then still a blue one 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.949
 kajal and wear it on it and 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.280
 then I go with purple again easily 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.319
 about it 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.149
 next I'll wear a silver one 

00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:03.370
 Eyeshadow in the angle and also 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.140
 easy on the song 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.610
 I'm painting with a white kohl 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.570
 the waterline and the lower ones 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.460
 By the way, I have eyelashes here 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.049
 I do not have contact lenses in them right now 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.610
 have more in there because my eyes today 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:13.720
 just did not want it so much 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.310
 Please forgive me 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:21.640
 then i will take my white color again 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:23.320
 and once a line with the 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.399
 same color I also mine 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:29.110
 eyelashes so now the actual catches 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.330
 I'll mess you up first 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:36.460
 careful glitter on top of the 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.780
 cheekbones and on the eyelids with 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.399
 I glue such eyelash glue now 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.780
 small beads on it always pushes 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.580
 a bit the clown up 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.840
 it's best to let it dry 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.820
 Glue before a bit too 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.190
 dry on yes I do it on both 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:52.140
 Eyes once at the end of each knit 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.140
 and once directly in Winkel 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:02.929
 I glue with glue again 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.700
 now I make the artificial snow 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:06.259
 now something larger and tell you 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:15.950
 that it's such a mess all my 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:17.030
 room looks terrible I 've got 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.830
 also on the cheekbones 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.390
 Just stick it where it is for me 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.330
 coolest except but as I said that is 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:27.410
 I really do not remember 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:29.180
 roommate with the white jumbo 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.400
 brush still painted my lips and 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.530
 then take a purple eyeshadow and 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.049
 surround it carefully and not too 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.950
 suffered severely 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.690
 and here, too, I have one more 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.640
 bit of glitter and artificial snow with 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.360
 glued on eyelash glue that gives that 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.709

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.120

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.799
 Of course, first opened the hair 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.930

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.459
 snow-covered este laid in the hair 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.569

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.310
 I also have a little bit more 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.569
 Artificial snow on the hair I have given 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.489

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:02.209
