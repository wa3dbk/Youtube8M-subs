00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.490
 Hello everyone 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.510
 I'll show you a technique 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.160
 that you have probably already seen a 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.830
 little bit on youtube that I pick up there 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:31.960
 it's really something as usual 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:34.710
 of basic renato of the food film of 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:40.499
 polish pony knife on your work 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.499
 and then stamped on your angle 

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:49.059
 and so it makes a small effect a little 

00:00:46.359 --> 00:00:54.539
 effect a little marble and so obviously 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:54.539
 then you clean all the contour 

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:59.019
 so him so much that dries the side 

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:01.859
 practice of the work plan is that we 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:01.859
 can clean up after 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.220
 here is a little the effect that it gives 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.390
 and after I passed over a small 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.540
 to make a little bit of a fund a 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:20.250
 deco background and I had a shot of 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:22.740
 as stopping over with the 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.060
 platform rattle for example so here I 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.680
 will use this design there that I have not 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.910
 too much I do not have anything that 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.300
 cover my bottom too much but I want it 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:38.400
 still covers completely missed 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:42.270
 I do not know what it will be like if 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:46.590
 it's going to be too short to the bread I use 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:51.020
 my buddy conad the young green one 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.020
 pony all over the surface of the nail 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.840
 so here is once determined you 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.310
 take your correcting pen and you 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.579
 come down clean the entire outline of 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.579
 the nail 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.830
 or properly so to finish 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.480
 a layer of top coat 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.870
 we always pay attention when we 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:32.670
 pass our top coat to noeux for not 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.670
 drool stenting 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:46.390
 really your your brush brushes 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.910
 really the surface of the nail 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.459
 if you press your brush too much 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.819
 do you will drool all your 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:58.799
 stamping and you're going to be forced all 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.799
 start again and that's great 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:22.300
 so here I am green now its 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.950
 confreres so that's it for this little 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.180
 deco super nice 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.080
 frankly it's not it's really not 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:32.480
 complicated it's it's basic 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.910
 accessible for everyone so that's it 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.690
 actually makes you a background a pink background 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:40.849
 with purple mottling camouflage 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.890
 shot with a stamping and frankly 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:48.019
 Here it's a small super costs 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:50.209
 nice we will redo the point on 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:53.060
 products that I used to make the 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:56.049
 base on pink and I used the 433's 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:59.959
 at home from beautiful galway collection 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:04.010
 still at bahl 303 rape is a rape 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:06.079
 has dark fashion color collection so 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:10.280
 then I used either you use 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:11.690
 to be able to use paper the 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.370
 bags in which fruit is put 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.579
 and vegetables at the supermarket it works very 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.079
 well 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:16.700
 rather than swinging them or not knowing 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:18.889
 too much to do with you keep them 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.590
 you votive feast of cons so that's 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:28.100
 I have taken to buffer intoned 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:31.220
 on the on the kind varnish passes a 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.220
 layer because I admit it so here 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.169
 so ultra chain top coat of neon oak 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:41.000
 for stenting then I took then 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:42.350
 I feel betrayed below always is it 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.750
 monras clear transparent tower do not 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:48.680
 damage the plate so as not to scratch it 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:50.990
 buffer conan it's this one 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:55.190
 so that's on the plate at home 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.600
 the year is the pastoral 0.01 and then 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.289
 ben the comparator site that's it 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.880
 always useful 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:02.930
 and then I think we went around 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:05.270
 so here you can have fun at 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:09.320
 to make full mottling make it like that 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:14.680
 add some little stamping so here you go 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.680
 pro see you soon for a new decor
