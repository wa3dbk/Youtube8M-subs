 compound just obtained on the mix of 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.210
 we mix flour just enough 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.060
 to get the dough into shapes but to the 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:43.840
 same time rough and lumpy all the time 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:47.319
 like that of the mustache let rest the 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.810

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:51.700
 minute scales a pan for cracks or one 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.950
 non-stick table for a great 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.229
 successful the flame will have to be 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:00.430
 quite high and the pan will have to 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:03.340
 be well kata to position 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.350

 we can also choose a measuring cup 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:12.010
 American by a quarter of a hunt now 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.650
 available and all the shops while for 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.930
 fry I use the ideal coconut oil 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.920
 for this type of cooking, why not 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.269
 produces trans fats at high temperatures 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.730
 pour teaspoon of coconut oil 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.840
 on the pan and distribute it with a 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.690
 brush 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.489
 so we are the batter ladle 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.340
 depending on the size of yours 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:37.390
 pan you can fry from two to 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.670

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.760
 computer and culture on the other 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.489
 side all the rest 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:55.850
 pancakes in a dish overlapping them 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:57.950
 so as to keep the soft and warm 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.490
 we complete the parks we distribute 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.050
 of banana effects on each layer 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.720

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.840
 in bits and error I love everything with you 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.270
 the maple syrup, the beauty of the parks 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.100
 which is that you can stuff with everything 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:16.190
 what we prefer seasonal fruit 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.920
 dried fruit peanut butter topping at 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.550

 I assure you these punk leagues are

 really tasty and a healthier version 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.290
 light that you can no longer do
