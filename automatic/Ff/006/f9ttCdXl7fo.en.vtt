 whales do not know how to properly called 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.400

 about lemon lemon is added only in 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.540
 stale fish to kill the smell 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.610

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.080

 i love a little bit sharp so i 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:55.590
 add ordinary pepper well took it from 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.380

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:04.140
 then add what I told you here 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:05.280
 this honey thing is literally right now 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.989
 you yourself also need 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:11.070

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:16.590
 sign and 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:18.600
 and Marina cutlets then take a teaspoon 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.950
 this song she remove with olive 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:25.320
 oil right there and so I left again and 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:29.670
 abdomen rations now all this means 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:33.090
 I take a small piece I take red 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:38.570
 pepper and does not like pepper because it 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:41.400
 awful here and here on it's all about 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.360
 hands can be pre-washed 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.120
 necessarily in the sink 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:49.970
 all this is so rubbed on ours 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:52.610
 perch red abdomen flips over 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:56.130
 also rubbed 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:58.069
 so here it all looks like you see 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.890
 for some reason she fins everything 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:03.230
 this red doesn't know why such a thing 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:05.170
 here you are laying this whole bunch of you 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.269
 say how many days this fish 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.189
 how much can the mods on the previous 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:12.530
 video can all look great 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:14.810
 here on the gills, you can see yes what 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:18.019
 here it is fresh gills 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.769
 all natural all cool and you 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:23.810
 pulled these some there 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:28.660
 the most delicious in the perch is 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:31.460
 they are very cheeks 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.710
 no and when pickles pulls out guts 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.289
 still pull out that here I don't know it is not 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.490
 cheeks cheeks eat a bunch of tasty not 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:39.889
 Our desktop parts 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.320
 already make it easier to pull out our gills themselves 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:42.830
 pulls out basically so here is a fish 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.620
 this 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:50.360
 and almost for I leave 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:52.639
 literally there for 15 20 minutes to stand 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.490
 a little palm juice sauce a little 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:59.419
 so that it marinated can cover 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:02.150
 lid here and so you can put in 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:03.050
 the fridge can be a cold place like this 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.389
 it all looks 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:08.180
 And so it looks like a dish where it will be 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:11.060
 then after the server is ready you have it 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.820
 pickled tomatoes with small cherry tomatoes 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:17.720
 and here are avocados like this too 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:22.300
