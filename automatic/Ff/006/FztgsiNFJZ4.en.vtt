00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.020 
thing is because the key switches has
all<00:01:33.530> the<00:01:33.680> action<00:01:34.100> and<00:01:34.310> how<00:01:34.400> its<00:01:34.610> gonna<00:01:34.760> feel

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
all the action and how its gonna feel

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.290 
all the action and how its gonna feel
when<00:01:35.210> you<00:01:35.330> type<00:01:35.570> and<00:01:36.430> when<00:01:37.430> you<00:01:37.640> when<00:01:38.090> you<00:01:38.150> pick

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
when you type and when you when you pick

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.090 
when you type and when you when you pick
this<00:01:38.420> out<00:01:38.600> just<00:01:38.900> know<00:01:39.110> the<00:01:39.380> type<00:01:39.560> of<00:01:39.590> keys<00:01:39.890> so

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
this out just know the type of keys so

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.040 
this out just know the type of keys so
this<00:01:40.280> is<00:01:40.460> the<00:01:40.610> Cherry<00:01:40.850> MX<00:01:40.910> blue<00:01:41.330> is<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:41.810> Cherry

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
this is the Cherry MX blue is the Cherry

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.320 
this is the Cherry MX blue is the Cherry
MX<00:01:42.200> brown<00:01:42.530> and<00:01:43.160> you<00:01:43.670> can<00:01:43.790> actually<00:01:43.910> see<00:01:44.210> the

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
MX brown and you can actually see the

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.050 
MX brown and you can actually see the
keys<00:01:44.570> let<00:01:44.930> me<00:01:45.020> open<00:01:45.260> this<00:01:45.620> up<00:01:45.820> the<00:01:46.820> name

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
keys let me open this up the name

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.150 
keys let me open this up the name
actually<00:01:47.330> corresponds<00:01:48.050> to<00:01:48.080> how<00:01:48.800> the<00:01:48.860> key

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160 
actually corresponds to how the key

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.860 
actually corresponds to how the key
looks<00:01:49.490> so<00:01:49.610> if<00:01:49.670> you<00:01:49.760> ever<00:01:49.880> wondering<00:01:50.330> what<00:01:50.720> is

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
looks so if you ever wondering what is

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.060 
looks so if you ever wondering what is
inside<00:01:51.230> of<00:01:51.350> your<00:01:51.470> keyboard<00:01:51.800> you<00:01:51.860> can<00:01:51.890> just

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
inside of your keyboard you can just

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.560 
inside of your keyboard you can just
remove<00:01:52.280> the<00:01:52.430> key<00:01:52.610> you<00:01:53.030> can<00:01:53.240> see<00:01:53.390> if<00:01:53.450> it's<00:01:53.540> a

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
remove the key you can see if it's a

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.570 
remove the key you can see if it's a
rubber<00:01:53.750> dome<00:01:54.020> or<00:01:54.350> if<00:01:54.650> it's<00:01:54.770> a<00:01:54.830> mechanical<00:01:55.070> key

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
rubber dome or if it's a mechanical key

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.340 
rubber dome or if it's a mechanical key
and<00:01:55.790> actually<00:01:56.030> which<00:01:56.210> type<00:01:56.450> of<00:01:56.480> switch<00:01:56.900> it<00:01:57.200> is

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
and actually which type of switch it is

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.890 
and actually which type of switch it is
and<00:01:57.850> you<00:01:58.850> know<00:01:58.940> that's<00:01:59.120> a<00:01:59.210> key<00:01:59.360> thing<00:01:59.510> to<00:01:59.570> over

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
and you know that's a key thing to over

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.870 
and you know that's a key thing to over
key<00:02:00.110> thing<00:02:00.260> that's<00:02:00.380> a<00:02:00.470> big<00:02:00.650> thing<00:02:00.770> to<00:02:00.950> you<00:02:01.820> know

key thing that's a big thing to you know
pay<00:02:02.060> attention<00:02:02.480> to<00:02:02.600> because<00:02:02.720> if<00:02:02.840> you're

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
pay attention to because if you're

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.120 
pay attention to because if you're
looking<00:02:03.050> at<00:02:03.260> two<00:02:03.380> different<00:02:03.410> keyboards<00:02:04.010> and

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
looking at two different keyboards and

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.000 
looking at two different keyboards and
they<00:02:04.190> have<00:02:04.340> both<00:02:04.760> the<00:02:04.940> same<00:02:05.450> key<00:02:06.380> mechanical

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
they have both the same key mechanical

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.580 
they have both the same key mechanical
key<00:02:07.190> switch<00:02:07.520> there<00:02:08.000> should<00:02:08.390> perform

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
key switch there should perform

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.569 
key switch there should perform
similarly<00:02:09.590> what<00:02:09.859> you're<00:02:10.009> really<00:02:10.099> buying<00:02:10.429> is

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:10.579 
similarly what you're really buying is

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:11.949 
similarly what you're really buying is
everything<00:02:10.879> else<00:02:11.000> maybe<00:02:11.269> the<00:02:11.450> name<00:02:11.629> brand

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
everything else maybe the name brand

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.170 
everything else maybe the name brand
maybe<00:02:12.260> it<00:02:12.439> glows<00:02:13.099> in<00:02:13.129> the<00:02:13.310> dark<00:02:13.400> I<00:02:13.700> know<00:02:13.819> so<00:02:14.000> buy

reader or I don't know whatever else
into<00:02:59.299> it<00:02:59.420> you'll<00:02:59.569> have<00:02:59.659> to<00:02:59.750> plug<00:02:59.900> in<00:03:00.049> two<00:03:00.319> just

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
into it you'll have to plug in two just

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.949 
into it you'll have to plug in two just
note<00:03:01.280> them<00:03:01.489> that<00:03:01.760> it's<00:03:01.909> not<00:03:01.970> going<00:03:02.299> to<00:03:02.569> bring

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
note them that it's not going to bring

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.800 
note them that it's not going to bring
full<00:03:03.260> power<00:03:03.500> from<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.129> USB<00:03:04.549> port<00:03:04.879> so<00:03:04.939> you<00:03:05.329> it's

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
full power from the USB port so you it's

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.240 
full power from the USB port so you it's
not<00:03:05.930> gonna<00:03:06.019> be<00:03:06.139> a<00:03:06.170> fully<00:03:06.379> charged<00:03:06.650> an<00:03:06.739> iPad<00:03:07.069> you

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
not gonna be a fully charged an iPad you

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.259 
not gonna be a fully charged an iPad you
know<00:03:07.370> stuff<00:03:07.549> like<00:03:07.579> that<00:03:07.700> is<00:03:07.879> probably<00:03:08.150> won't

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
know stuff like that is probably won't

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.750 
know stuff like that is probably won't
still<00:03:08.510> want<00:03:08.659> to<00:03:08.689> plug<00:03:08.959> that<00:03:09.079> into<00:03:09.319> the<00:03:09.530> back<00:03:09.760> so

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
still want to plug that into the back so

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.119 
still want to plug that into the back so
that's<00:03:10.849> kind<00:03:11.120> of<00:03:11.209> key<00:03:11.420> differences<00:03:11.659> between

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:12.129 
that's kind of key differences between

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:14.710 
that's kind of key differences between
keys<00:03:13.129> these<00:03:13.609> keys<00:03:13.909> here<00:03:14.150> let's<00:03:14.540> actually

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
keys these keys here let's actually

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.960 
keys these keys here let's actually
listen<00:03:15.230> to<00:03:15.409> this<00:03:15.590> so<00:03:15.799> um<00:03:16.129> the<00:03:16.519> big<00:03:16.639> thing<00:03:16.819> is

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
listen to this so um the big thing is

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.490 
listen to this so um the big thing is
mechanical<00:03:17.510> keyboards<00:03:17.810> are<00:03:17.900> gonna<00:03:18.019> make<00:03:18.260> some

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
mechanical keyboards are gonna make some

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.439 
mechanical keyboards are gonna make some
noise<00:03:18.680> that's<00:03:18.949> actually<00:03:19.220> by<00:03:19.370> design<00:03:19.730> they

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:20.449 
noise that's actually by design they

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:22.900 
noise that's actually by design they
have<00:03:20.599> a<00:03:20.629> tactile<00:03:21.590> feel<00:03:22.129> to<00:03:22.370> them<00:03:22.549> and<00:03:22.760> actually

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
have a tactile feel to them and actually

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.759 
have a tactile feel to them and actually
you<00:03:23.120> can<00:03:23.269> hear<00:03:23.480> them<00:03:23.569> sort<00:03:23.840> of<00:03:23.930> click<00:03:24.230> and<00:03:24.379> the

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
you can hear them sort of click and the

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.069 
you can hear them sort of click and the
idea<00:03:24.980> here<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:25.310> with<00:03:25.639> the<00:03:25.760> with<00:03:26.299> the<00:03:26.419> silent

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
idea here the with the with the silent

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:28.780 
idea here the with the with the silent
one<00:03:27.230> doesn't<00:03:27.530> make<00:03:27.590> quite<00:03:27.889> as<00:03:28.010> much<00:03:28.220> noise<00:03:28.489> so

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
one doesn't make quite as much noise so

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.759 
one doesn't make quite as much noise so
you<00:03:29.389> know<00:03:29.480> you<00:03:30.169> know<00:03:30.260> I<00:03:30.319> don't<00:03:30.470> know<00:03:30.530> it's<00:03:30.620> kind

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
you know you know I don't know it's kind

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:31.869 
you know you know I don't know it's kind
of<00:03:30.799> weird<00:03:30.889> if<00:03:31.069> you<00:03:31.099> if<00:03:31.459> you're<00:03:31.699> in<00:03:31.790> an

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:31.879 
of weird if you if you're in an

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:32.949 
of weird if you if you're in an
environment<00:03:32.329> where<00:03:32.449> you<00:03:32.569> don't<00:03:32.599> want<00:03:32.810> to<00:03:32.870> make

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
environment where you don't want to make

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.089 
environment where you don't want to make
a<00:03:32.989> whole<00:03:33.199> lot<00:03:33.349> of<00:03:33.379> noise<00:03:33.560> you're<00:03:33.799> gonna<00:03:33.889> want

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.099 
a whole lot of noise you're gonna want

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:35.409 
a whole lot of noise you're gonna want
to<00:03:34.159> go<00:03:34.250> for<00:03:34.400> the<00:03:34.459> silent<00:03:34.819> but<00:03:34.909> it<00:03:34.970> still<00:03:35.209> makes

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:35.419 
to go for the silent but it still makes

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:37.509 
to go for the silent but it still makes
more<00:03:35.599> noise<00:03:35.659> in<00:03:36.079> the<00:03:36.169> rubber<00:03:36.379> dome<00:03:36.709> so<00:03:37.040> if

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
more noise in the rubber dome so if

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:38.229 
more noise in the rubber dome so if
you're<00:03:37.669> looking<00:03:37.730> for<00:03:37.940> something<00:03:38.090> completely

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
you're looking for something completely

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:39.789 
you're looking for something completely
sound<00:03:38.750> you<00:03:38.989> know<00:03:39.079> to<00:03:39.139> stick<00:03:39.379> probably<00:03:39.709> with

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
sound you know to stick probably with

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.099 
sound you know to stick probably with
the<00:03:39.859> rubber<00:03:40.040> dome<00:03:40.310> but<00:03:41.150> if<00:03:41.239> you<00:03:41.389> want<00:03:41.569> to<00:03:41.690> have

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109 
the rubber dome but if you want to have

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:43.899 
the rubber dome but if you want to have
one<00:03:42.290> really<00:03:42.500> good<00:03:42.620> in<00:03:42.829> your<00:03:42.949> office

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:43.909 
one really good in your office

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:45.129 
one really good in your office
environment<00:03:44.419> this<00:03:44.540> is<00:03:44.659> gonna<00:03:44.780> be<00:03:44.900> your<00:03:44.989> best

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139 
environment this is gonna be your best

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:46.960 
environment this is gonna be your best
bet<00:03:45.440> for<00:03:45.500> that<00:03:45.859> so<00:03:45.979> actually<00:03:46.069> here<00:03:46.430> let's<00:03:46.879> see

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
bet for that so actually here let's see

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.659 
bet for that so actually here let's see
what<00:03:47.090> we're<00:03:47.209> talking<00:03:47.239> about<00:03:48.220> so<00:03:49.220> this<00:03:49.519> one

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:49.669 
what we're talking about so this one

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:54.550 
what we're talking about so this one
here<00:03:49.819> I'll<00:03:49.909> have<00:03:50.090> a<00:03:50.329> little<00:03:50.569> click<00:03:50.810> on<00:03:50.900> it<00:03:53.560> okay

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
here I'll have a little click on it okay

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.430 
here I'll have a little click on it okay
so<00:03:54.620> if<00:03:54.859> you<00:03:54.979> can<00:03:55.690> hear<00:03:56.690> that<00:03:56.840> and<00:03:57.139> then<00:03:57.290> let's

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
so if you can hear that and then let's

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.469 
so if you can hear that and then let's
go<00:03:57.590> over<00:03:57.620> here<00:03:58.359> okay<00:03:59.359> so<00:03:59.389> there's<00:03:59.690> no<00:03:59.750> click<00:04:01.479> on

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:02.479 
go over here okay so there's no click on

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.949 
go over here okay so there's no click on
that

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
that

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:04.809 
that
so<00:04:03.620> let's<00:04:03.739> actually<00:04:03.859> do<00:04:04.069> a<00:04:04.099> full<00:04:04.159> type<00:04:04.609> and<00:04:04.760> you

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 
so let's actually do a full type and you

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:05.979 
so let's actually do a full type and you
can<00:04:04.909> hear<00:04:05.120> how<00:04:05.209> loud<00:04:05.449> there<00:04:05.690> when<00:04:05.870> you're

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
can hear how loud there when you're

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:13.180 
can hear how loud there when you're
pushing<00:04:06.829> all<00:04:06.979> the<00:04:07.099> way<00:04:07.129> down<00:04:07.370> on<00:04:07.609> it

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:20.620 

okay<00:04:16.120> so<00:04:17.860> so<00:04:18.860> it<00:04:18.980> still<00:04:19.190> has<00:04:19.220> a<00:04:19.630> noticeable

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
okay so so it still has a noticeable

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.840 
okay so so it still has a noticeable
click<00:04:20.989> it's<00:04:21.170> not<00:04:21.290> as<00:04:21.440> loud<00:04:21.650> as<00:04:21.890> louder<00:04:22.550> than<00:04:22.820> a

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
click it's not as loud as louder than a

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.280 
click it's not as loud as louder than a
standard<00:04:23.270> uh<00:04:23.420> you<00:04:23.570> know<00:04:23.630> dome<00:04:23.840> style<00:04:24.050> keyboard

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
standard uh you know dome style keyboard

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.230 
standard uh you know dome style keyboard
but<00:04:24.650> you<00:04:25.280> don't<00:04:25.460> get<00:04:25.550> that<00:04:25.610> little<00:04:25.880> click

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
but you don't get that little click

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.850 
but you don't get that little click
click<00:04:26.480> the<00:04:26.660> little<00:04:26.900> click<00:04:27.110> clack<00:04:27.350> I<00:04:27.560> guess<00:04:27.710> is

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
click the little click clack I guess is

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.620 
click the little click clack I guess is
maybe<00:04:28.040> the<00:04:28.160> best<00:04:28.340> best<00:04:28.790> way<00:04:28.880> to<00:04:29.000> describe<00:04:29.420> it

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
maybe the best best way to describe it

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.300 
maybe the best best way to describe it
so<00:04:29.660> quieter<00:04:30.140> but<00:04:30.320> still<00:04:30.590> you<00:04:30.770> know<00:04:30.860> make<00:04:31.070> some

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
so quieter but still you know make some

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.730 
so quieter but still you know make some
noise<00:04:31.520> so<00:04:32.240> again<00:04:32.480> you<00:04:33.110> know<00:04:33.200> whatever<00:04:33.620> your

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
noise so again you know whatever your

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.020 
noise so again you know whatever your
situation<00:04:33.920> is<00:04:34.250> if<00:04:34.400> you<00:04:34.460> really<00:04:34.700> want<00:04:34.850> to<00:04:34.910> have

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
situation is if you really want to have
