00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
responsive we've talked about it for a

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.950 
responsive we've talked about it for a
good<00:00:38.040> couple<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.399> weeks<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.790> in<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.719> end<00:00:39.870> we

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
good couple of weeks and in the end we

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.750 
good couple of weeks and in the end we
thought<00:00:40.219> what<00:00:41.219> we<00:00:41.250> thought<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.579> was<00:00:41.640> the

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
thought what we thought it was the

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.790 
thought what we thought it was the
camera<00:00:42.000> issue<00:00:42.239> turns<00:00:42.989> out<00:00:43.140> it's<00:00:43.350> just<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.590> lens

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
camera issue turns out it's just a lens

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.139 
camera issue turns out it's just a lens
so<00:00:44.100> it's<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.309> hardware<00:00:44.550> sheen's<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.120> a

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
so it's a hardware sheen's it of a

00:00:45.149 --> 00:01:42.420 
so it's a hardware sheen's it of a
software<00:00:45.539> issue<00:00:45.629> yay<00:00:46.020> here<00:00:46.739> we<00:00:46.829> go

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.480 

what<00:01:43.210> a<00:01:43.240> transformation<00:01:43.540> huh<00:01:44.350> green<00:01:44.890> green

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
what a transformation huh green green

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.850 
what a transformation huh green green
grass<00:01:45.820> so<00:01:46.480> i<00:01:46.690> guess<00:01:47.170> it<00:01:47.350> was<00:01:47.380> really<00:01:47.830> a

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860
