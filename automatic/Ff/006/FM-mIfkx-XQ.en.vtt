00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
according to qf so pretty good there and

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.610 
according to qf so pretty good there and
he's<00:04:12.340> very<00:04:12.370> strong<00:04:13.090> in<00:04:13.269> the<00:04:13.330> back<00:04:13.480> so<00:04:14.019> pretty

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
he's very strong in the back so pretty

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.580 
he's very strong in the back so pretty
good<00:04:14.680> player<00:04:15.010> for<00:04:15.359> your<00:04:16.359> bronze<00:04:16.720> left-back

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
good player for your bronze left-back

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.170 
good player for your bronze left-back
you<00:04:18.070> know<00:04:18.160> obviously<00:04:18.340> he<00:04:18.640> wanted<00:04:18.910> to<00:04:18.970> go<00:04:19.090> with

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
you know obviously he wanted to go with

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.370 
you know obviously he wanted to go with
kind<00:04:19.390> of<00:04:19.419> a<00:04:19.510> mixture<00:04:19.750> of<00:04:19.810> all<00:04:19.989> these<00:04:20.019> players

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
kind of a mixture of all these players

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.140 
kind of a mixture of all these players
so<00:04:20.680> you<00:04:21.100> can<00:04:21.250> probably<00:04:21.430> get<00:04:21.609> some<00:04:21.729> gold<00:04:21.940> left

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
so you can probably get some gold left

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.610 
so you can probably get some gold left
backs<00:04:22.360> but<00:04:22.600> I<00:04:22.930> think<00:04:23.140> it's<00:04:23.260> pretty<00:04:23.350> cool<00:04:23.560> that

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
backs but I think it's pretty cool that

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.380 
backs but I think it's pretty cool that
you<00:04:23.919> know<00:04:24.010> you<00:04:24.070> don't<00:04:24.460> have<00:04:24.550> all<00:04:24.910> goals<00:04:25.210> are

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
you know you don't have all goals are

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.590 
you know you don't have all goals are
