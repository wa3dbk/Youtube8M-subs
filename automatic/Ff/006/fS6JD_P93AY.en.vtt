him<00:01:20.990> as<00:01:21.110> his<00:01:21.170> little<00:01:21.470> kid<00:01:21.680> but<00:01:21.950> Carl<00:01:22.159> is<00:01:22.310> really

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
him as his little kid but Carl is really

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:23.800 
him as his little kid but Carl is really
starting<00:01:22.820> to<00:01:22.909> turn<00:01:23.060> into<00:01:23.120> more<00:01:23.390> of<00:01:23.450> a<00:01:23.570> fighter

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
starting to turn into more of a fighter

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.140 
starting to turn into more of a fighter
now<00:01:24.020> I'm<00:01:24.320> really<00:01:25.010> hoping<00:01:25.340> that<00:01:25.400> that<00:01:25.790> Carl

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
now I'm really hoping that that Carl

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.330 
now I'm really hoping that that Carl
fighter<00:01:26.630> storyline<00:01:27.229> will<00:01:27.590> actually<00:01:27.920> dub<00:01:28.130> tail

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
fighter storyline will actually dub tail

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.250 
fighter storyline will actually dub tail
with<00:01:28.580> the<00:01:28.700> governor<00:01:29.030> storyline<00:01:29.540> wouldn't<00:01:30.200> it

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
with the governor storyline wouldn't it

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.630 
with the governor storyline wouldn't it
be<00:01:30.320> awesome<00:01:30.500> to<00:01:30.800> see<00:01:30.950> Carl<00:01:31.190> take<00:01:31.430> out<00:01:31.549> the

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
be awesome to see Carl take out the

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.340 
be awesome to see Carl take out the
governor<00:01:31.970> obviously<00:01:32.270> Michonne<00:01:32.930> is<00:01:33.110> the<00:01:33.200> one

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
governor obviously Michonne is the one

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.810 
governor obviously Michonne is the one
that<00:01:33.470> should<00:01:33.620> do<00:01:33.740> it<00:01:33.890> but<00:01:34.100> Carl<00:01:34.430> doing<00:01:34.700> it

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
that should do it but Carl doing it

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.850 
that should do it but Carl doing it
would<00:01:35.000> just<00:01:35.150> be<00:01:35.240> so<00:01:35.540> much<00:01:35.780> crazier<00:01:36.170> and<00:01:36.440> can<00:01:36.740> we

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
would just be so much crazier and can we

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.740 
would just be so much crazier and can we
talk<00:01:37.010> about<00:01:37.159> Tyreese<00:01:37.670> Tyreese<00:01:38.330> obviously

still does not know about Carol but it
was<00:01:40.610> really<00:01:40.760> interesting<00:01:40.970> watching<00:01:41.540> Rick

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
was really interesting watching Rick

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.510 
was really interesting watching Rick
start<00:01:42.049> telling<00:01:42.350> people<00:01:42.380> obviously<00:01:42.979> Maggie

start telling people obviously Maggie

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.190 
start telling people obviously Maggie
kind<00:01:43.909> of<00:01:43.970> had<00:01:44.090> her<00:01:44.240> doubts<00:01:44.420> at<00:01:44.659> first<00:01:44.690> but<00:01:45.049> that

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
kind of had her doubts at first but that

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.539 
kind of had her doubts at first but that
she<00:01:45.290> said<00:01:45.440> no<00:01:45.590> you<00:01:45.650> did<00:01:45.920> the<00:01:46.010> right<00:01:46.159> thing<00:01:46.369> and

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
she said no you did the right thing and

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:47.859 
she said no you did the right thing and
then<00:01:46.850> after<00:01:47.119> that<00:01:47.270> none<00:01:47.570> of<00:01:47.600> the<00:01:47.750> other

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
then after that none of the other

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:49.630 
then after that none of the other
characters<00:01:48.290> question<00:01:48.770> Rick's<00:01:49.040> decision<00:01:49.520> I

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
characters question Rick's decision I

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.710 
characters question Rick's decision I
think<00:01:49.729> they<00:01:49.909> all<00:01:50.000> kind<00:01:50.210> of<00:01:50.270> understood<00:01:50.630> the

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
think they all kind of understood the

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.210 
think they all kind of understood the
Carol<00:01:51.020> had<00:01:51.170> to<00:01:51.290> leave<00:01:51.470> what<00:01:51.920> is<00:01:52.010> going<00:01:52.159> to

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
Carol had to leave what is going to

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.680 
Carol had to leave what is going to
happen<00:01:52.430> when<00:01:52.580> Tyreese<00:01:52.940> finds<00:01:53.180> out<00:01:53.390> he's

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
happen when Tyreese finds out he's

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:54.789 
happen when Tyreese finds out he's
obviously<00:01:53.840> probably<00:01:54.260> going<00:01:54.470> to<00:01:54.530> lose<00:01:54.650> it

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
obviously probably going to lose it

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:55.990 
obviously probably going to lose it
again<00:01:54.860> he's<00:01:55.100> mostly<00:01:55.369> concerned<00:01:55.670> with<00:01:55.729> Sasha

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
again he's mostly concerned with Sasha

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.340 
again he's mostly concerned with Sasha
right<00:01:56.270> now<00:01:56.420> but<00:01:56.690> I<00:01:56.720> imagine<00:01:56.930> his<00:01:57.320> reaction

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
right now but I imagine his reaction

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.410 
right now but I imagine his reaction
will<00:01:58.190> be<00:01:58.220> similar<00:01:58.640> to<00:01:58.820> the<00:01:58.909> way<00:01:59.030> that<00:01:59.210> other

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
will be similar to the way that other

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.700 
will be similar to the way that other
people<00:01:59.689> react<00:01:59.990> when<00:02:00.140> they<00:02:00.229> find<00:02:00.260> out<00:02:00.500> that<00:02:00.530> the

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
people react when they find out that the

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.380 
people react when they find out that the
governor's<00:02:01.100> back<00:02:01.400> so<00:02:01.790> the<00:02:01.909> big<00:02:02.060> questions

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
what did I think of the episode overall

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.150 
what did I think of the episode overall
I<00:02:26.660> give<00:02:26.810> it<00:02:26.930> a<00:02:26.990> solid<00:02:27.140> b-plus<00:02:27.410> it<00:02:27.860> was<00:02:27.980> so

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
I give it a solid b-plus it was so

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.070 
I give it a solid b-plus it was so
intense<00:02:28.520> despite<00:02:29.060> being<00:02:29.240> so<00:02:29.450> self<00:02:29.720> contained

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
intense despite being so self contained

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.960 
intense despite being so self contained
in<00:02:30.260> this<00:02:30.380> small<00:02:30.620> cell<00:02:30.890> block<00:02:31.070> a<00:02:31.280> the<00:02:31.670> episode

in this small cell block a the episode
was<00:02:32.060> called<00:02:32.180> internment<00:02:32.690> so<00:02:32.810> we<00:02:32.900> knew<00:02:33.020> it<00:02:33.050> was

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
with like a cattle shoot if you've ever

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.910 
with like a cattle shoot if you've ever
seen<00:03:48.019> a<00:03:48.080> slaughterhouse<00:03:48.440> they<00:03:48.709> basically

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
seen a slaughterhouse they basically

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.410 
seen a slaughterhouse they basically
funnel<00:03:49.310> cattle<00:03:49.610> through<00:03:49.790> this<00:03:49.910> really<00:03:50.180> narrow

funnel cattle through this really narrow

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.000 
funnel cattle through this really narrow
opening<00:03:50.900> so<00:03:51.049> they<00:03:51.140> can<00:03:51.290> kill<00:03:51.470> them<00:03:51.620> one<00:03:51.830> at<00:03:51.920> a

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
opening so they can kill them one at a

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.860 
opening so they can kill them one at a
time<00:03:52.040> and<00:03:52.549> you<00:03:52.970> know<00:03:53.090> in<00:03:53.150> this<00:03:53.269> episode<00:03:53.690> how
