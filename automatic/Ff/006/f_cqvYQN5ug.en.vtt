00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
how to pack a punch in transit mode so

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.970 
how to pack a punch in transit mode so
as<00:00:06.839> you<00:00:06.960> saw<00:00:07.109> there<00:00:07.350> we<00:00:07.470> had<00:00:07.589> to<00:00:07.680> grab<00:00:07.859> the

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
as you saw there we had to grab the

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.950 
as you saw there we had to grab the
power<00:00:08.160> turbine<00:00:08.670> this<00:00:09.179> is<00:00:09.360> essential<00:00:09.929> for

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
power turbine this is essential for

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.650 
power turbine this is essential for
turning<00:00:10.410> on<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.559> power<00:00:10.710> or<00:00:11.480> activating<00:00:12.480> pack

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
turning on the power or activating pack

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:13.970 
turning on the power or activating pack
punch<00:00:12.929> so<00:00:13.139> first<00:00:13.320> you<00:00:13.410> got<00:00:13.500> to<00:00:13.530> make<00:00:13.710> sure<00:00:13.889> the

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
punch so first you got to make sure the

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.230 
punch so first you got to make sure the
power<00:00:14.130> is<00:00:14.280> off<00:00:14.460> then<00:00:14.849> you're<00:00:14.940> going<00:00:15.030> to<00:00:15.120> put

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
power is off then you're going to put

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.300 
power is off then you're going to put
that<00:00:15.269> turbine<00:00:15.900> there<00:00:16.170> in<00:00:16.560> front<00:00:16.980> of<00:00:17.039> that<00:00:17.130> door

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
that turbine there in front of that door

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.820 
that turbine there in front of that door
that's<00:00:17.490> in<00:00:17.699> the<00:00:17.820> third<00:00:18.180> stop<00:00:18.510> on<00:00:18.840> in<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.320> CDC

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
that's in the third stop on in the CDC

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.519 
that's in the third stop on in the CDC
building<00:00:20.150> so<00:00:21.150> next<00:00:21.539> for<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:21.990> second<00:00:22.350> player

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
building so next for the second player

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.259 
building so next for the second player
or<00:00:22.830> if<00:00:22.859> you're<00:00:23.279> just<00:00:23.400> going<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.670> hurry<00:00:24.029> up<00:00:24.150> and

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
do this by yourself open up these two

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.939 
do this by yourself open up these two
grenade<00:00:27.210> these<00:00:27.510> two<00:00:27.779> doors<00:00:28.439> with<00:00:28.619> grenades

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
grenade these two doors with grenades

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.260 
grenade these two doors with grenades
safe<00:00:29.550> grenades<00:00:30.109> this<00:00:31.109> will<00:00:31.289> be<00:00:31.619> in<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.980> town

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
safe grenades this will be in the town

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.610 
safe grenades this will be in the town
so<00:00:33.270> this<00:00:33.420> will<00:00:33.510> be<00:00:33.570> your<00:00:33.690> fourth<00:00:33.989> stop<00:00:34.290> right

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
after the CDC building and then once the

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.220 
after the CDC building and then once the
power<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.140> finally<00:00:37.770> turned<00:00:38.010> on<00:00:38.190> after<00:00:39.230> you

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
power is finally turned on after you

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.200 
power is finally turned on after you
place<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.469> turbine<00:00:40.920> there<00:00:41.160> you<00:00:41.879> just<00:00:42.000> run

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
place that turbine there you just run

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.000 
place that turbine there you just run
down<00:00:42.329> here<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:43.230> got<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.469> find<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.770> three

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
down here and you got to find the three

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.860 
down here and you got to find the three
parts<00:00:44.399> for<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.940> practical<00:00:45.300> entry<00:00:45.510> now<00:00:45.750> I'm

will<00:00:53.250> be<00:00:53.340> able<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.550> see<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.760> parts

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
will be able to see the parts

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:56.389 
will be able to see the parts
unfortunately<00:00:55.469> so<00:00:55.949> we're<00:00:56.100> going<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.250> just

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
unfortunately so we're going to just

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.680 
unfortunately so we're going to just
build<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.670> up<00:00:56.850> here<00:00:57.030> we're<00:00:57.210> going<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.390> speed

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
build that up here we're going to speed

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.010 
build that up here we're going to speed
run<00:00:57.719> over<00:00:58.440> here<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:58.859> pick<00:00:59.520> up<00:00:59.870> okay<00:01:00.870> we're

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
run over here and pick up okay we're

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.840 
run over here and pick up okay we're
going<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.199> slow<00:01:01.620> motion<00:01:01.980> now<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.399> we're<00:01:02.730> going

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
going to slow motion now and we're going

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.590 
going to slow motion now and we're going
to<00:01:02.879> pick<00:01:03.149> up<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.780> body<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.799> know<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.010> base<00:01:05.189> of

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
to pick up the body you know the base of

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.429 
to pick up the body you know the base of
the<00:01:07.790> pack-a-punch<00:01:08.790> machine<00:01:09.140> and<00:01:10.140> we're<00:01:10.320> going

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
the pack-a-punch machine and we're going

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.140 
the pack-a-punch machine and we're going
to<00:01:10.470> put<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.159> add<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.700> our<00:01:11.729> project

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
to put that and add it to our project

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.620 
to put that and add it to our project
and<00:01:12.689> then<00:01:13.260> for<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.619> third<00:01:13.890> piece<00:01:14.640> it's<00:01:15.090> right

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
and then for the third piece it's right

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.179 
and then for the third piece it's right
there<00:01:15.869> so<00:01:16.759> basically<00:01:17.759> um<00:01:18.830> what<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:19.979> got<00:01:20.100> is

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
there so basically um what you got is

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.649 
there so basically um what you got is
going<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.460> go<00:01:20.549> all<00:01:20.670> those<00:01:20.790> three<00:01:21.060> I'm<00:01:21.299> going<00:01:21.600> to

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
going to go all those three I'm going to

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.899 
going to go all those three I'm going to
recap<00:01:22.080> this<00:01:22.350> so<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:22.979> got<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.220> turn<00:01:23.369> off<00:01:23.670> the

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
recap this so you got to turn off the

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.570 
recap this so you got to turn off the
power<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:25.049> I<00:01:25.080> would<00:01:25.590> turn<00:01:25.799> on<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.100> power<00:01:26.250> and

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
power so I would turn on the power and

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.200 
power so I would turn on the power and
turn<00:01:26.729> off<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.119> power<00:01:27.439> then<00:01:28.439> put<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.549> turbine

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
turn off the power then put a turbine

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.539 
turn off the power then put a turbine
power<00:01:30.479> turbine<00:01:30.900> in<00:01:31.110> front<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.560> door<00:01:31.829> that

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
power turbine in front of that door that

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.160 
power turbine in front of that door that
right<00:01:32.850> it's<00:01:33.210> right<00:01:33.390> below<00:01:33.540> where<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.869> drop

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
right it's right below where you drop

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.289 
right it's right below where you drop
down<00:01:34.439> when<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:34.860> first<00:01:35.040> go<00:01:35.189> into<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.520> CDC

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
down when you first go into the CDC

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.580 
down when you first go into the CDC
building<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.400> and<00:01:38.400> then<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.900> further<00:01:40.259> by

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
building and and then you further by
