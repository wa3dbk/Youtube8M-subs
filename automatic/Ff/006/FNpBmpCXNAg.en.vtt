00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.259
 hello together today I finally have 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.649
 again a review for you 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:10.349
 or a book recommendation and 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.420
 Although it is about tomorrow comes a new one 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.670
 heaven of the most original companies 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.470
 the whole thing appeared in the fisherman 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.900
 krüger verlag and it really has me 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.840
 I also liked it a lot 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:26.010
 There had been minor flaws here 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.570
 Brett and Brad is in their mid- thirties 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.760
 actually full in their lives 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.099
 she has a good job in 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.559
 the marketing department in the family 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.309
 from her the family of the company of hers 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.570
 mother she has a boyfriend and with that 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.320
 Together in a condominium 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.989
 lives and yes actually one thinks so brad 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.200
 she has everything she has everything she wants 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.430
 wants and is happy in her life 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.270
 her mother, however, sees it completely 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.719
 different 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.859
 Unfortunately, her mother is terminally ill and 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.660
 but had made the task even 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:02.280
 to bring brad after her death 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.640
 that your life takes itself into the hand 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:09.950
 and finally get really happy and 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:13.619
 there she is, so to speak, a very 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.090
 risky way you have one 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.460
 list found 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.470
 writing the bread as she 14x 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.680
 and on this list are some 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.750
 life goals of which board at that time with 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.490
 14 years have thought so she wants 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.020
 achieve when she grows up 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.000
 is for example, I'm a horse 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.710
 buy and child get home 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.530
 I buy a real love 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.670
 and so on and so on 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:40.320
 unfortunately , so to speak, kids just aim 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.909
 you just when you grow up 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.540
 So a bit out of sight loses 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.700
 and brands mother never tells me 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.220
 want my child to achieve these goals 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.509
 fulfilled because then I know then it will be 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.280
 they are really happy 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:57.420
 the action starts now on the day 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:00.820
 from the cleanup of mother's board 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:04.399
 and shortly thereafter wants to know how 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.479
 yes, the mother has thought the whole thing 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.360
 and her daughter back on the 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.560
 to bring back the right way of life 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.380
 Board is suddenly sitting with their 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.290
 two brothers and their wives at 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.900
 lawyer and it should be about that yes 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.840
 the heritage is distributed brad gets then 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:24.200
 but to hear that they share their share of 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.989
 Erbes will not get it before they all 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.030
 achieved these goals on the list 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.500
 and that project within a year 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.630
 should be so within a time 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.140
 get year baby and buy a house 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:38.000
 and and and yes that is there you have to completely 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.630
 especially beautiful brad swallow the 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.790
 has indeed just lost their mother 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.410
 and really is the mourning 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.489
 but at the same time full of good 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:51.440
 her mother that she does her something like that 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.030
 reader you just know her course 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.440
 mother thinks is only good and she wants 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.329
 yes only the best for your daughter and 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.250
 she just kid her daughter and knows 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:03:01.250
 so that's life she is living now that is 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.590
 not what she's what she just 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:07.459
 really happy world sees it 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.620
 Of course, nothing and yes 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:13.069
 Nevertheless, it begins , so to speak, and 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.510
 after she tries to attack the targets 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:19.069
 to take and try the list 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:21.139
 to work off and that creates it 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.690
 everything does not stand alone 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:25.400
 a few great people aside and 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.709
 her mother has hers as well 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.590
 fingers in the game that's all yes 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:34.940
 somehow quite sophisticated in the ways 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.829
 headed and I have to say I found 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.730
 this story just made me feel good 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:43.700
 always have death earlier because 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:46.819
 just the first time again the mourning 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.010
 was absolutely to read from board and 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:50.480
 where I just sometimes where I'm there 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.989
 still a tweet to tell us 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.299
 but rolled down is easy 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:58.190
 at the same time this stupidity and 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:01.389
 also somewhere the trouble about her mother 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:04.310
 that she forces her to do it 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:05.239
 complete life on the pile 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.269
 to throw 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.220
 you have now 80 the goal in the 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.230
 fall in love 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.620
 I already have that I have 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.730
 already there really already 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.829
 My friend and I are together 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.720
 happy and so at the same time asking 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:23.440
 then it really is me 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.430
 and I mean just now 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.110
 you are so in yourself 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.000
 bogged down in his life and 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.350
 maybe it went times each ever 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.330
 so that one wondered so what 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.340
 I have so that's really what I am 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:37.300
 I really want to make that happy 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.500
 or should i give them that again 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.870
 everything umschmeißen again very of 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.480
 start at the beginning but that's just me 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.610
 also a step that is not exactly small 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:49.300
 is and that is a big helping of courage 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.650
 requires and that's why you do that 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.120
 not so easy and therefore 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.010
 Of course it stays very much 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.010
 hard to attack it all somehow 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.600
 take and for me flew pages 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.610
 that's why I'm just there 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.070
 At the same time I was off 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.360
 fascinates so much that everything 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:08.110
 At the same time I have myself too 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:10.060
 always annoyed about her and 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.740
 That's why I had to but just had to 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.830
 always know what she is doing now what 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.180
 The pages have been flying before and there 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.720
 just for me that way I have 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.190
 read the book very fast and yes 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.780
 and that's why I have too 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.060
 because that was what I was 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.010
 I just wanted a book that 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.770
 easy to read is easy to read 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:31.660
 But that is not at the same time 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.430
 somehow touched and also to 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.570
 thought provoking and that has the book 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.900
 definitely made 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:41.620
 critical to note here that I would 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:43.330
 some aspects really in my opinion 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.160
 after pretty obvious and 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.669
 somewhere also predictable and that 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.050
 partly from the beginning but that has 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:51.990
 somehow not disturbed me great 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.800
 That's why I give it a bit 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.080
 point deduction I say 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.390
 but it still has me in the total package 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.370
 really entertain the book very well 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:03.460
 that took me, I got myself 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:05.620
 with brad I'm happy with 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:09.520
 brad annoyed and yes I have with her 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:13.060
 married and yes, that's exactly what 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.680
 such a book should trigger or somehow 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:17.039
 not that you sympathize and I have 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:20.000
 from a whole that's what got me 

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:21.410
 book very much i like it 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.930
 Again, this beautiful chamber 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:26.390
 in the camera I think it's totally 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.490
 great from tomorrow comes a new sky 

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.580
 Of course, this sentence has a whole 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:32.570
 certain meaning 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.870
 But you have to do that yourself 

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:38.590
 find out when you read the book 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:41.300
 That's why I can only recommend it to you 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:43.610
 is what should I say it is 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.860
 book for the heart so to speak and it stimulates 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.600
 think about what is where to catch you 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.730
 really maybe a bit too 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.850
 Questioning is what I have 

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:54.530
 It really is what I want or give 

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.520
 I'm just kind of satisfied with that 

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:59.330
 and did not really trust me 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:01.850
 break out and yes because of that 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:04.900
 definitive recommendation from me i have 

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:10.310
 given the book 455 hearts 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:12.950
 and if you're a light one really 

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:15.470
 easy to read reading but looking for 

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:19.040
 Nevertheless , it is that the book for 

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:22.310
 Definitely that's it for today 

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.780
 maybe I could you for that 

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.040
 that was it for today maybe come 

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:26.479
 i am delighting you for the book i am 

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:31.220
 I would be very happy if that was me 

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:33.260
 That's why I succeeded 

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:35.680
 Say goodbye for today and say 

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.680
 bye for now
