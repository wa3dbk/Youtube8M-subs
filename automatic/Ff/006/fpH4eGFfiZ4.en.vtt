00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.390
 we are rather a practical lesson 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.040
 the old general plan of the capital is not 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.810
 it was assumed that people in sleeping 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.799
 areas may need a theater or 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.439
 Cultural Center
