was the big single from this album it
reached<00:01:57.310> number<00:01:57.520> one<00:01:57.820> in<00:01:57.850> the<00:01:58.030> United<00:01:58.330> States

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
reached number one in the United States

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.840 
reached number one in the United States
and<00:01:59.020> it<00:01:59.140> was<00:01:59.230> the<00:01:59.350> reason<00:01:59.590> why<00:01:59.680> this<00:01:59.980> album<00:02:00.730> did

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
and it was the reason why this album did

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.990 
and it was the reason why this album did
very<00:02:01.030> well<00:02:01.090> today<00:02:01.450> it<00:02:02.080> had<00:02:02.260> a<00:02:02.290> hit<00:02:02.530> single<00:02:03.000> to

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
very well today it had a hit single to

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.890 
very well today it had a hit single to
support<00:02:04.570> it

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
support it

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.620 
support it
I<00:02:08.369> think<00:02:09.369> wildlife<00:02:09.880> didn't<00:02:10.240> do<00:02:10.360> so<00:02:10.600> well

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
I think wildlife didn't do so well

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.090 
I think wildlife didn't do so well
because<00:02:10.899> it<00:02:11.200> didn't<00:02:11.440> really<00:02:11.560> have<00:02:11.800> a<00:02:11.830> big

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
because it didn't really have a big

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.520 
because it didn't really have a big
single<00:02:12.640> to<00:02:12.850> support<00:02:13.570> it<00:02:16.050> even<00:02:17.050> though<00:02:17.380> it<00:02:17.500> was

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
single to support it even though it was

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.040 
single to support it even though it was
a<00:02:17.709> critically<00:02:18.430> panned<00:02:18.730> album<00:02:19.330> you<00:02:19.750> got<00:02:19.900> all
