myself I'll make my way over to my arena
should<00:01:20.189> probably<00:01:20.490> set<00:01:20.790> up<00:01:20.880> some<00:01:21.060> teleporters

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
should probably set up some teleporters

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.530 
should probably set up some teleporters
so<00:01:21.900> this<00:01:22.020> is<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.200> lot<00:01:22.470> faster<00:01:22.979> but<00:01:23.970> for<00:01:24.150> now<00:01:24.270> I'm

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
so this is a lot faster but for now I'm

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.810 
so this is a lot faster but for now I'm
just<00:01:24.570> running<00:01:25.290> along<00:01:25.560> my<00:01:26.130> sky<00:01:26.520> walk<00:01:27.560> so<00:01:28.820> let's

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
just running along my sky walk so let's

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.219 
just running along my sky walk so let's
keep<00:01:30.150> going<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:31.490> here<00:01:32.490> we<00:01:32.670> are

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
keep going and here we are

keep going and here we are
so<00:01:34.229> he's<00:01:34.829> going<00:01:35.400> right<00:01:35.490> there

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
so he's going right there

maybe I'll just do a brief tutorial on
how<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:42.899> use<00:01:43.259> bosses<00:01:43.799> on<00:01:43.890> your<00:01:44.040> items

is and you still have your thing so
that's<00:01:59.520> basically<00:01:59.820> how<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.030> use<00:02:00.210> it

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
that's basically how to use it

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.810 
that's basically how to use it
infinitely<00:02:00.600> um<00:02:01.590> if<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.130> so<00:02:02.310> probably<00:02:02.700> know

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
infinitely um if you so probably know

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.399 
infinitely um if you so probably know
you<00:02:03.000> don't<00:02:03.119> have<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.420> go<00:02:03.630> watch<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.840> video<00:02:04.110> but

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
you don't have to go watch the video but

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.380 
you don't have to go watch the video but
you<00:02:04.469> can<00:02:04.500> if<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:04.950> want<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.700> see<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.149> in<00:02:06.210> more

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
you can if you want to see it in more

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.650 
you can if you want to see it in more
detail<00:02:07.069> but<00:02:08.069> it's<00:02:08.220> not<00:02:08.369> really<00:02:08.550> worth<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:09.030> but

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
detail but it's not really worth it but

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.760 
detail but it's not really worth it but
anyway<00:02:10.020> I'm<00:02:10.730> feasting<00:02:11.730> on<00:02:12.410> okay<00:02:13.410> I'm<00:02:13.500> right

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
anyway I'm feasting on okay I'm right

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.500 
anyway I'm feasting on okay I'm right

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
so basically what you need to do is kill

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.360 
so basically what you need to do is kill
them<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:15.900> you<00:02:16.470> should<00:02:16.620> be<00:02:16.740> at<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:16.950> point<00:02:17.130> by

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
them and you should be at the point by

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.460 
them and you should be at the point by
now<00:02:17.550> where<00:02:17.820> it's<00:02:18.120> Oh<00:02:18.360> cram<00:02:18.690> is<00:02:18.840> easy<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.320> he's

now where it's Oh cram is easy and he's

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.190 
now where it's Oh cram is easy and he's
no<00:02:19.620> trouble<00:02:20.040> for<00:02:20.190> you<00:02:20.420> but<00:02:21.420> if<00:02:21.540> you're<00:02:21.660> not<00:02:21.870> you

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.720 
Adamantite and as you can see I'm not
gonna<00:02:36.390> use<00:02:36.510> these<00:02:36.710> you<00:02:37.710> can<00:02:37.890> just<00:02:38.040> do<00:02:38.370> it<00:02:38.400> again

and suddenly he can only be summoned at

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.840 
and suddenly he can only be summoned at
night<00:02:41.570> but<00:02:42.570> so<00:02:43.410> you<00:02:43.470> can<00:02:43.740> just<00:02:43.950> farm<00:02:44.370> all<00:02:44.640> night

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
you have to do and then at night just

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.560 
you have to do and then at night just
keep<00:02:49.170> farming<00:02:49.440> it<00:02:49.680> so<00:02:50.220> yeah<00:02:51.120> I'm<00:02:51.300> just<00:02:51.360> going

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
keep farming it so yeah I'm just going

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.840 
keep farming it so yeah I'm just going
to<00:02:51.660> keep<00:02:51.930> doing<00:02:52.110> this<00:02:52.230> as<00:02:52.500> you<00:02:53.460> can<00:02:53.490> see<00:02:53.580> it

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
to keep doing this as you can see it

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.460 
to keep doing this as you can see it
does<00:02:54.060> work<00:02:54.360> that<00:02:54.630> you<00:02:54.720> can<00:02:54.840> use<00:02:54.960> it<00:02:55.110> infinitely

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
does work that you can use it infinitely

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.580 
does work that you can use it infinitely
so<00:02:56.220> that's<00:02:57.090> basically<00:02:57.660> what<00:02:57.840> make<00:02:58.050> this<00:02:58.260> makes

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
so that's basically what make this makes

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.920 
so that's basically what make this makes
this<00:02:58.710> easy<00:02:59.010> is<00:02:59.310> that<00:02:59.940> you<00:03:00.090> can<00:03:00.240> get<00:03:00.390> Adamantite

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
this easy is that you can get Adamantite

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.580 
this easy is that you can get Adamantite
for<00:03:01.110> free<00:03:01.380> with<00:03:02.340> only<00:03:02.700> making<00:03:02.910> one<00:03:03.350> skull<00:03:04.350> and

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
for free with only making one skull and

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.830 
for free with only making one skull and
you<00:03:04.650> might<00:03:04.890> be<00:03:05.010> wondering<00:03:05.190> how<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:05.400> do<00:03:05.640> that

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
you might be wondering how to do that

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.890 
you might be wondering how to do that

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.760 
of those and I know that's a very
expensive<00:03:32.550> recipe<00:03:33.000> that's<00:03:33.690> why<00:03:33.870> using<00:03:34.410> this

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
expensive recipe that's why using this

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.380 
expensive recipe that's why using this
over<00:03:35.070> and<00:03:35.190> over<00:03:35.220> and<00:03:35.430> over<00:03:35.490> is<00:03:35.700> really<00:03:35.730> helpful

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
over and over and over is really helpful

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.000 
over and over and over is really helpful
so<00:03:36.690> you<00:03:36.720> don't<00:03:36.930> have<00:03:37.050> to<00:03:37.140> keep<00:03:37.320> making<00:03:37.709> them

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
so you don't have to keep making them

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.820 
so you don't have to keep making them
and<00:03:38.450> yeah<00:03:39.450> I<00:03:39.480> may<00:03:39.810> I<00:03:39.840> decided<00:03:40.290> to<00:03:40.410> make<00:03:40.500> a<00:03:40.530> whole

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
and yeah I may I decided to make a whole

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.860 
and yeah I may I decided to make a whole
bunch<00:03:40.860> just<00:03:41.520> because<00:03:41.850> I<00:03:42.150> didn't<00:03:42.600> know<00:03:42.720> about

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
bunch just because I didn't know about

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.750 
bunch just because I didn't know about
this<00:03:43.050> glitch<00:03:43.290> a<00:03:43.350> while<00:03:43.530> ago<00:03:43.740> but<00:03:44.400> I<00:03:44.459> have<00:03:44.730> a

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
this glitch a while ago but I have a

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.900 
this glitch a while ago but I have a
whole<00:03:45.000> bunch<00:03:45.090> now<00:03:45.240> um<00:03:45.660> and<00:03:46.140> I<00:03:46.890> just<00:03:46.920> yes<00:03:47.580> okay

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
whole bunch now um and I just yes okay

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.090 
whole bunch now um and I just yes okay
that's<00:03:48.090> that's<00:03:48.780> a<00:03:49.080> demonstration<00:03:49.620> of<00:03:49.860> what

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
that's that's a demonstration of what

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.430 
that's that's a demonstration of what
not<00:03:50.340> to<00:03:50.370> do<00:03:50.730> so<00:03:51.060> do<00:03:51.330> not<00:03:51.510> hold<00:03:51.870> it<00:03:52.110> and<00:03:52.260> then

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
not to do so do not hold it and then

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.530 
not to do so do not hold it and then
click<00:03:52.650> it<00:03:52.800> and<00:03:52.920> then<00:03:53.250> just<00:03:53.459> leave<00:03:53.820> it<00:03:53.970> because

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
click it and then just leave it because

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.480 
click it and then just leave it because
then<00:03:54.720> it<00:03:54.810> will<00:03:54.870> be<00:03:55.020> gone<00:03:55.200> and<00:03:55.440> you<00:03:56.160> can<00:03:56.310> see<00:03:56.459> I

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:56.490 
then it will be gone and you can see I

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.000 
then it will be gone and you can see I
got<00:03:56.850> 14<00:03:57.690> more<00:03:57.930> so<00:03:58.170> I<00:03:58.200> 39

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
got 14 more so I 39

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.460 
got 14 more so I 39
it<00:03:59.070> might<00:03:59.790> seem<00:03:59.970> slow<00:04:00.240> but<00:04:00.570> literally<00:04:01.020> how

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
it might seem slow but literally how

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.170 
it might seem slow but literally how
much<00:04:02.220> time<00:04:02.670> have<00:04:03.120> you<00:04:03.150> spent<00:04:03.650> like<00:04:04.940> mining<00:04:05.940> for

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
much time have you spent like mining for

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.640 
much time have you spent like mining for
adamantite<00:04:06.750> you<00:04:06.930> got<00:04:07.110> to<00:04:07.200> take<00:04:07.350> that<00:04:07.470> into

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
adamantite you got to take that into

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.460 
adamantite you got to take that into
consideration<00:04:08.030> because<00:04:09.030> I<00:04:09.300> farmed<00:04:09.720> so<00:04:10.200> many

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
consideration because I farmed so many

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.140 
consideration because I farmed so many
times<00:04:10.770> again<00:04:11.070> so<00:04:11.220> crammed<00:04:11.489> you<00:04:11.850> don't<00:04:12.030> even

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
times again so crammed you don't even

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.600 
times again so crammed you don't even
know<00:04:12.420> and<00:04:12.690> I've<00:04:13.380> gotten<00:04:14.070> all<00:04:14.220> of<00:04:14.459> that

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
know and I've gotten all of that

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.970 
know and I've gotten all of that
adamantite<00:04:15.120> like<00:04:15.270> I've<00:04:15.959> gotten<00:04:16.290> five<00:04:16.560> hundred

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
adamantite like I've gotten five hundred

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.190 
adamantite like I've gotten five hundred
of<00:04:17.130> my<00:04:17.250> adamantite<00:04:17.820> just<00:04:18.180> from<00:04:18.330> this<00:04:18.480> and<00:04:18.840> I've

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
of my adamantite just from this and I've

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.409 
of my adamantite just from this and I've
only<00:04:19.380> found<00:04:19.620> for<00:04:19.859> like<00:04:19.980> a<00:04:20.010> couple<00:04:20.340> days<00:04:20.520> and

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
only found for like a couple days and

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.330 
only found for like a couple days and
most<00:04:21.630> and<00:04:21.840> I'm<00:04:22.020> farmed<00:04:22.380> for<00:04:22.500> like<00:04:22.650> a<00:04:22.860> couple

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
most and I'm farmed for like a couple

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.960 
most and I'm farmed for like a couple
nights<00:04:23.520> everyday<00:04:24.240> so<00:04:24.300> it's<00:04:24.810> like<00:04:24.960> no<00:04:25.680> it's<00:04:25.860> not

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
nights everyday so it's like no it's not

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.140 
nights everyday so it's like no it's not
it's

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
it's

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.450 
it's
not<00:04:27.240> bad<00:04:27.449> at<00:04:27.630> all<00:04:27.750> actually<00:04:28.320> so<00:04:28.530> uh<00:04:28.560> you<00:04:29.310> can

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
not bad at all actually so uh you can

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.249 
not bad at all actually so uh you can
just<00:04:29.580> keep<00:04:29.729> doing<00:04:30.030> this<00:04:30.150> I'm<00:04:30.419> gonna<00:04:30.540> face<00:04:31.169> them

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:31.259 
just keep doing this I'm gonna face them

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:33.350 
just keep doing this I'm gonna face them
one<00:04:31.530> more<00:04:31.680> time<00:04:31.860> and<00:04:32.070> we'll<00:04:32.820> see<00:04:32.850> how<00:04:33.060> much<00:04:33.210> in

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
one more time and we'll see how much in

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.010 
one more time and we'll see how much in
advance<00:04:33.509> how'd<00:04:33.780> I<00:04:33.810> get<00:04:35.449> again<00:04:36.449> you<00:04:36.660> should<00:04:36.900> be

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
advance how'd I get again you should be

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.800 
advance how'd I get again you should be
at<00:04:37.110> the<00:04:37.229> point<00:04:37.410> where<00:04:37.590> oak<00:04:38.550> Ram<00:04:38.820> is<00:04:39.060> easy<00:04:39.509> for

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
at the point where oak Ram is easy for

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.420 
at the point where oak Ram is easy for
you<00:04:39.960> and<00:04:40.080> you<00:04:40.169> can<00:04:40.320> farm<00:04:40.590> them<00:04:40.800> easily<00:04:41.039> and

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
you and you can farm them easily and

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.430 
you and you can farm them easily and
it's<00:04:41.550> not<00:04:41.699> like<00:04:41.820> a<00:04:41.850> challenge<00:04:42.419> and<00:04:42.630> if<00:04:43.199> it<00:04:43.289> is<00:04:43.410> a

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
it's not like a challenge and if it is a

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.870 
it's not like a challenge and if it is a
challenge<00:04:43.919> you<00:04:43.979> probably<00:04:44.370> should<00:04:44.550> hold<00:04:44.729> off

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
challenge you probably should hold off

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.999 
challenge you probably should hold off
on<00:04:45.030> doing<00:04:45.060> this<00:04:45.570> I<00:04:45.810> know<00:04:46.350> you<00:04:46.410> should<00:04:46.620> you're

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:47.009 
on doing this I know you should you're

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:49.100 
on doing this I know you should you're
probably<00:04:47.250> saying<00:04:47.520> well<00:04:47.789> I<00:04:48.030> need<00:04:48.449> Adamantite

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
probably saying well I need Adamantite

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.379 
probably saying well I need Adamantite
so<00:04:49.410> I<00:04:49.440> can<00:04:49.650> get<00:04:49.830> to<00:04:49.949> that<00:04:50.039> level<00:04:50.330> no<00:04:51.330> you

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
so I can get to that level no you

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:53.960 
so I can get to that level no you
actually<00:04:51.720> don't<00:04:52.020> you<00:04:52.259> can<00:04:52.440> face<00:04:53.370> them<00:04:53.580> with<00:04:53.699> I

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
actually don't you can face them with I

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.790 
actually don't you can face them with I
know<00:04:54.449> you<00:04:54.660> can<00:04:54.810> probably<00:04:55.050> faced<00:04:55.229> with<00:04:55.380> mithril

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
know you can probably faced with mithril

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.390 
know you can probably faced with mithril
armor<00:04:56.400> too<00:04:56.580> so<00:04:57.419> I<00:04:57.449> have<00:04:57.660> 56<00:04:58.560> Adamantite<00:04:59.190> from

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
armor too so I have 56 Adamantite from

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.270 
armor too so I have 56 Adamantite from
facing<00:04:59.789> three<00:05:00.150> of<00:05:00.360> them<00:05:01.050> and<00:05:01.289> I've<00:05:01.740> haven't

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
facing three of them and I've haven't

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.300 
facing three of them and I've haven't
used<00:05:03.180> a<00:05:03.449> single<00:05:04.110> or<00:05:04.440> I<00:05:04.500> haven't<00:05:04.830> gotten<00:05:04.979> rid<00:05:05.070> of

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
used a single or I haven't gotten rid of

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.760 
used a single or I haven't gotten rid of
this<00:05:05.460> thing<00:05:05.669> except<00:05:06.090> that<00:05:06.180> one<00:05:06.510> time<00:05:06.720> I<00:05:06.930> messed

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
this thing except that one time I messed

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.180 
this thing except that one time I messed
up<00:05:08.039> uh-huh<00:05:08.490> but<00:05:09.320> yeah<00:05:10.320> that's<00:05:10.500> basically<00:05:10.919> how

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
up uh-huh but yeah that's basically how

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.500 
up uh-huh but yeah that's basically how
you<00:05:11.580> farm<00:05:12.360> for<00:05:12.660> him<00:05:12.780> and<00:05:14.180> you<00:05:15.180> might<00:05:15.360> be

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
you farm for him and you might be

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.140
