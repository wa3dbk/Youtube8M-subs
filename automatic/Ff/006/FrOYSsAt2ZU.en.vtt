fin goes up against the ICF blocking and
that<00:03:08.959> gets<00:03:09.170> screwed<00:03:09.590> right<00:03:09.830> into<00:03:10.190> it<00:03:10.340> and<00:03:10.489> then

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
that gets screwed right into it and then

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.390 
that gets screwed right into it and then
once<00:03:11.180> that<00:03:11.239> windows<00:03:11.690> installed<00:03:12.170> in<00:03:12.470> from<00:03:13.310> the

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
once that windows installed in from the

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.940 
once that windows installed in from the
inside<00:03:13.850> and<00:03:13.880> get<00:03:14.180> some<00:03:14.390> expansion<00:03:14.930> foam<00:03:15.440> that

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
inside and get some expansion foam that

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.520 
inside and get some expansion foam that
will<00:03:16.130> keep<00:03:16.340> any<00:03:17.110> infiltrating<00:03:18.110> through<00:03:18.350> it

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
will keep any infiltrating through it

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.440 
will keep any infiltrating through it
the<00:03:19.340> other<00:03:19.489> important<00:03:19.940> thing<00:03:19.970> is<00:03:20.090> flashing

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
the other important thing is flashing

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.870 
the other important thing is flashing
flashing<00:03:21.230> is<00:03:21.590> an<00:03:21.680> integral<00:03:22.010> part<00:03:22.040> that<00:03:22.489> has<00:03:22.730> to

flashing is an integral part that has to

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.670 
flashing is an integral part that has to
be<00:03:22.910> taken<00:03:23.209> care<00:03:23.600> of<00:03:23.630> and<00:03:23.900> there's<00:03:24.200> a<00:03:24.290> sequence

be taken care of and there's a sequence

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.559 
be taken care of and there's a sequence
upon<00:03:24.980> which<00:03:25.160> you<00:03:25.250> put<00:03:25.400> it<00:03:25.519> in<00:03:25.640> first<00:03:26.180> you<00:03:26.330> put<00:03:26.540> a

upon which you put it in first you put a

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.620 
upon which you put it in first you put a
pan<00:03:27.350> flashing<00:03:28.010> on<00:03:28.130> the<00:03:28.190> bottom<00:03:28.970> then<00:03:29.480> you

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
pan flashing on the bottom then you

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.809 
pan flashing on the bottom then you
install<00:03:30.050> the<00:03:30.200> window<00:03:30.590> then<00:03:31.160> you<00:03:31.280> put<00:03:31.550> your

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
install the window then you put your

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:33.430 
install the window then you put your
vertical<00:03:32.600> flashing<00:03:33.140> and<00:03:33.230> then<00:03:33.319> your

vertical flashing and then your

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.180 
vertical flashing and then your
horizontal<00:03:33.709> flashing

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.420 

it's<00:03:39.190> extremely<00:03:39.820> sticky<00:03:40.950> it<00:03:41.950> keeps<00:03:42.160> the<00:03:42.280> water

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
it's extremely sticky it keeps the water

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:49.930 
it's extremely sticky it keeps the water
from<00:03:42.550> penetrating<00:03:42.790> behind<00:03:43.660> the<00:03:43.750> window
