on our project I'm referring to as the

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.509 
on our project I'm referring to as the
Franken<00:00:28.080> Mac<00:00:28.320> where<00:00:28.920> I'm<00:00:29.160> going<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.400> be

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
Franken Mac where I'm going to be

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.189 
Franken Mac where I'm going to be
building<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.269> out<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.539> upgrading<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.050> to

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
building that out and upgrading it to

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.110 
building that out and upgrading it to
new<00:00:31.380> hardware<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.099> it's<00:00:32.489> going<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:32.730> run<00:00:32.880> both

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
new hardware and it's going to run both

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.810 
new hardware and it's going to run both
Windows<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:33.780> Macintosh<00:00:34.290> so<00:00:35.219> that's<00:00:35.579> gonna<00:00:35.730> be

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
Windows and Macintosh so that's gonna be

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.910 
Windows and Macintosh so that's gonna be
really<00:00:36.000> exciting<00:00:36.450> for<00:00:36.600> me<00:00:36.750> but<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.590> will<00:00:37.770> be

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
really exciting for me but that will be

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.130 
really exciting for me but that will be
covered<00:00:38.340> in<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.610> later<00:00:38.640> video<00:00:39.210> while<00:00:39.899> not<00:00:40.079> to

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
covered in a later video while not to

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.619 
covered in a later video while not to
talk<00:00:40.230> about<00:00:40.379> right<00:00:40.890> now<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.610> an<00:00:42.030> emphasis<00:00:42.270> on

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
talk about right now is an emphasis on

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.990 
talk about right now is an emphasis on
building<00:00:43.050> versus<00:00:43.620> buying<00:00:43.829> so<00:00:44.460> if<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:44.760> want<00:00:44.940> to

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
building versus buying so if you want to

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.060 
building versus buying so if you want to
buy<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.510> Photoshop<00:00:46.140> or<00:00:46.379> repin<00:00:46.620> design<00:00:46.800> machine

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
buy a Photoshop or repin design machine

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.229 
buy a Photoshop or repin design machine
there's<00:00:47.250> absolutely<00:00:47.640> nothing<00:00:47.879> wrong<00:00:48.059> with

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
there's absolutely nothing wrong with

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.060 
there's absolutely nothing wrong with
that<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.750> later<00:00:49.200> I'm<00:00:49.469> gonna<00:00:49.590> talk<00:00:49.770> about<00:00:49.890> the

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
that and later I'm gonna talk about the

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.220 
that and later I'm gonna talk about the
specs<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.550> need<00:00:50.719> for<00:00:51.719> whether<00:00:52.050> you're

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
specs you need for whether you're

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.380 
specs you need for whether you're
building<00:00:52.469> or<00:00:52.829> you're<00:00:53.129> buying<00:00:53.340> but<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.210> main

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
building or you're buying but the main

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.840 
building or you're buying but the main
thing<00:00:54.690> was<00:00:54.989> building<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.860> if<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.460> build<00:00:56.640> it

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
thing was building it is if you build it

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.270 
thing was building it is if you build it
you<00:00:57.000> know<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.809> suits<00:00:58.140> your<00:00:58.500> needs<00:00:58.559> you

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
you know that it suits your needs you

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.010 
you know that it suits your needs you
know<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.579> you're<00:00:59.699> not<00:00:59.820> overpaying<00:01:00.449> for

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
know that you're not overpaying for

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.660 
know that you're not overpaying for
something<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:02.190> know<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:02.460> you're<00:01:02.579> not

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
something and you know that you're not

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.460 
something and you know that you're not
having<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.969> worry<00:01:03.180> about<00:01:03.470> upgradability

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
having to worry about upgradability

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.219 
having to worry about upgradability
later<00:01:04.769> or<00:01:05.159> what<00:01:05.519> it's<00:01:05.700> max<00:01:06.000> capacity<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.810> if

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
later or what it's max capacity is if

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.140 
later or what it's max capacity is if
you<00:01:07.500> buy<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.740> components<00:01:08.280> yourself<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.850> you

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
you buy the components yourself and you

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.090 
you buy the components yourself and you
decide<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.689> want<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.960> start<00:01:10.290> at<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.920> low

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
decide that you want to start at the low

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.830 
decide that you want to start at the low
end<00:01:11.310> but<00:01:11.400> have<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.760> option<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.299> go<00:01:12.450> up<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.720> the

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
end but have the option to go up to the

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.800 
end but have the option to go up to the
high<00:01:13.049> end<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.470> can<00:01:13.860> do<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.310> when<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.119> build

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
high end you can do that when you build

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.710 
high end you can do that when you build
versus<00:01:16.439> buy<00:01:16.619> sometimes<00:01:17.490> when<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.790> buy<00:01:18.060> not

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
versus buy sometimes when you buy not

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.160 
versus buy sometimes when you buy not
all<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.320> components<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.009> parts<00:01:20.520> will<00:01:20.970> be

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
all the components and parts will be

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.450 
all the components and parts will be
readily<00:01:22.170> upgradable<00:01:22.830> without<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.189> doing<00:01:23.310> a

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
readily upgradable without you doing a

readily upgradable without you doing a
whole<00:01:23.700> lot<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:24.030> work<00:01:24.210> or<00:01:24.479> throwing<00:01:24.900> away<00:01:25.080> parts

whole lot of work or throwing away parts
entirely<00:01:26.100> this<00:01:26.939> will<00:01:27.150> save<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.600> money<00:01:27.630> in<00:01:28.200> the

entirely this will save you money in the
long<00:01:28.470> run<00:01:28.710> if<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.280> build<00:01:29.610> something<00:01:29.970> based<00:01:30.780> on

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
long run if you build something based on

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.410 
long run if you build something based on
your<00:01:31.439> growth<00:01:31.829> needs<00:01:32.130> when<00:01:32.759> you're<00:01:32.909> doing<00:01:33.270> it

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
your growth needs when you're doing it

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.319 
your growth needs when you're doing it

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
doing that at the outset is just a

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.429 
doing that at the outset is just a
really<00:01:36.659> important<00:01:37.079> step<00:01:37.259> in<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.409> process

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
really important step in the process

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.130 
really important step in the process
because<00:01:38.100> maybe<00:01:38.670> right<00:01:39.000> now<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.240> only<00:01:39.540> need<00:01:39.630> 16

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
because maybe right now you only need 16

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.800 
because maybe right now you only need 16
gigs<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.710> RAM<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.220> maybe<00:01:41.970> that's<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.329> max<00:01:42.600> the

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
gigs of RAM and maybe that's the max the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.630 
gigs of RAM and maybe that's the max the
motherboard<00:01:43.259> takes<00:01:43.560> but<00:01:44.280> if<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.520> were

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
motherboard takes but if you were

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.100 
motherboard takes but if you were
building<00:01:45.090> it<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.509> knew<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.840> one<00:01:46.079> day

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
building it and you knew that one day

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.560 
building it and you knew that one day
you<00:01:46.320> might<00:01:46.560> want<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.860> go<00:01:46.979> up<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.159> 32<00:01:47.490> or<00:01:47.820> even<00:01:48.000> 64

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
you might want to go up to 32 or even 64

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
gigs of ram maybe you want to get into

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.120

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.280

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
easier to handle all this stuff if you

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.300 
easier to handle all this stuff if you
keep<00:02:06.719> it<00:02:06.869> in<00:02:06.990> mind<00:02:07.229> when<00:02:07.350> you<00:02:07.560> start<00:02:07.619> one<00:02:08.220> of

you<00:02:09.670> know<00:02:10.000> how<00:02:10.750> well<00:02:11.050> it's<00:02:11.410> going<00:02:11.650> to<00:02:11.800> perform

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
you know how well it's going to perform

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.340 
you know how well it's going to perform
because<00:02:12.460> you<00:02:13.360> made<00:02:13.630> those<00:02:13.780> decisions

going to be handled by what you

purchased now on the other hand if
you're<00:02:25.930> someone<00:02:26.230> who's<00:02:26.350> less<00:02:26.560> technically

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
you're someone who's less technically

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.590 
you're someone who's less technically
inclined<00:02:27.550> they're<00:02:27.790> definitely<00:02:27.970> reasons<00:02:28.480> to

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
inclined they're definitely reasons to

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.620 
inclined they're definitely reasons to
buy<00:02:28.810> and<00:02:29.320> if<00:02:29.740> you<00:02:29.920> don't<00:02:30.130> know<00:02:30.430> what<00:02:31.210> you<00:02:31.360> need

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
buy and if you don't know what you need

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.090 
buy and if you don't know what you need
and<00:02:31.870> you<00:02:32.050> know<00:02:32.170> you<00:02:32.230> just<00:02:32.350> need<00:02:32.590> to<00:02:32.710> plug<00:02:32.920> in

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
and you know you just need to plug in

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.560 
and you know you just need to plug in
something<00:02:33.460> and<00:02:33.580> work<00:02:33.820> then<00:02:34.270> you<00:02:34.390> should

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
something and work then you should

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.720 
something and work then you should
definitely<00:02:34.960> buy<00:02:35.230> instead<00:02:35.770> of<00:02:35.860> build<00:02:36.130> because

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
definitely buy instead of build because

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:37.920 
definitely buy instead of build because
you<00:02:36.880> can<00:02:37.030> end<00:02:37.060> up<00:02:37.240> creating<00:02:37.570> a<00:02:37.690> lot<00:02:37.840> of

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
you can end up creating a lot of

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.290 
you can end up creating a lot of
problems<00:02:38.290> by<00:02:38.410> building<00:02:38.890> especially<00:02:39.610> if<00:02:40.150> you

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
problems by building especially if you

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.000 
problems by building especially if you
damaged<00:02:40.750> components<00:02:41.320> by<00:02:41.410> not<00:02:41.590> installing

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
damaged components by not installing

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.640 
damaged components by not installing
them<00:02:42.250> correctly<00:02:42.690> by<00:02:43.690> components<00:02:44.470> that<00:02:44.560> are

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
them correctly by components that are

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.920 
them correctly by components that are
incompatible<00:02:45.100> with<00:02:45.430> one<00:02:45.640> another<00:02:45.850> so<00:02:46.420> that's

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
incompatible with one another so that's

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:47.880 
incompatible with one another so that's
another<00:02:47.260> problem

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
another problem

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.400 
another problem
but<00:02:48.250> if<00:02:48.430> you<00:02:48.610> need<00:02:48.850> to<00:02:49.210> handle<00:02:49.720> compatibility

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
but if you need to handle compatibility

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.900 
but if you need to handle compatibility
issues<00:02:50.680> I<00:02:50.800> definitely<00:02:51.250> recommend<00:02:51.490> using<00:02:51.760> a

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
issues I definitely recommend using a

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.700 
issues I definitely recommend using a
website<00:02:52.060> called<00:02:52.420> PC<00:02:52.840> parts<00:02:53.200> picker<00:02:53.440> and

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
website called PC parts picker and

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.290 
website called PC parts picker and
that's<00:02:54.100> really<00:02:54.250> going<00:02:54.430> to<00:02:54.550> help<00:02:54.640> you<00:02:54.820> out<00:02:54.850> if

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
that's really going to help you out if

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.030 
that's really going to help you out if
you're<00:02:55.450> a<00:02:55.510> first<00:02:55.570> time<00:02:56.110> builder<00:02:56.500> now<00:02:56.800> on<00:02:56.920> the

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
you're a first time builder now on the

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.150 
you're a first time builder now on the
buying<00:02:57.280> side<00:02:57.670> if<00:02:58.000> you<00:02:58.540> decide<00:02:58.870> to<00:02:58.900> buy<00:02:59.560> Mac

buying side if you decide to buy Mac

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.220 
buying side if you decide to buy Mac
then<00:03:00.670> you<00:03:00.850> know<00:03:01.030> for<00:03:01.360> the<00:03:01.600> most<00:03:01.840> part<00:03:02.110> that

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
then you know for the most part that

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.630 
then you know for the most part that
that's<00:03:02.410> gonna<00:03:02.530> work<00:03:02.770> on<00:03:02.920> it's<00:03:03.040> gonna<00:03:03.220> fit<00:03:03.460> and
