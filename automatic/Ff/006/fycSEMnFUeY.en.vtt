00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
expect to see the area of 32 degrees or

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.160 
expect to see the area of 32 degrees or
less<00:01:56.610> following<00:01:57.360> in<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.540> areas<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:57.960> light

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.510 
35 w and also to the north of interstate
30<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.750> 20<00:02:07.049> that's<00:02:07.770> going<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.039> be<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.220> area

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
30 and 20 that's going to be the area

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.460 
30 and 20 that's going to be the area
where<00:02:08.700> we<00:02:08.849> see<00:02:09.030> temperatures<00:02:09.270> drop<00:02:09.690> below<00:02:09.840> 29

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
where we see temperatures drop below 29

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.440 
where we see temperatures drop below 29
degrees<00:02:10.890> so<00:02:11.220> we<00:02:11.430> are<00:02:11.849> going<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.060> see<00:02:12.239> some

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
degrees so we are going to see some

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.490 
degrees so we are going to see some
widespread<00:02:12.690> impacts

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
widespread impacts

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.860 
widespread impacts
even<00:02:13.800> though<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.130> precipitation<00:02:14.910> is<00:02:15.240> not

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
even though the precipitation is not

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.830 
even though the precipitation is not
going<00:02:16.020> to<00:02:16.080> be<00:02:16.200> very<00:02:16.350> heavy<00:02:16.650> at<00:02:16.830> all<00:02:17.720> well<00:02:18.720> as

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
going to be very heavy at all well as

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.540 
going to be very heavy at all well as
far<00:02:19.050> as<00:02:19.140> our<00:02:19.230> confidence<00:02:19.740> and<00:02:19.890> impacts<00:02:20.250> for

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
far as our confidence and impacts for

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.730 
far as our confidence and impacts for
tonight<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.270> tomorrow<00:02:21.360> well<00:02:22.110> first<00:02:22.560> of<00:02:22.680> all

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
tonight and tomorrow well first of all

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.860 
tonight and tomorrow well first of all
our<00:02:22.920> expected<00:02:23.400> impacts<00:02:23.730> are<00:02:24.000> mainly<00:02:24.300> travel

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
our expected impacts are mainly travel

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.750 
our expected impacts are mainly travel
could<00:02:25.470> see<00:02:25.680> some<00:02:25.860> ice<00:02:25.980> accumulations

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
could see some ice accumulations

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.330 
could see some ice accumulations
especially<00:02:27.330> on<00:02:27.420> bridges<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:27.870> overpasses

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
especially on bridges and overpasses

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.430 
especially on bridges and overpasses
power<00:02:29.340> outages<00:02:29.820> are<00:02:30.030> possible<00:02:30.840> but<00:02:31.140> right<00:02:31.290> now

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
power outages are possible but right now

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.780 
power outages are possible but right now
we're<00:02:31.590> thinking<00:02:31.920> anything<00:02:32.130> like<00:02:32.400> that<00:02:32.430> might

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
we're thinking anything like that might

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.990 
we're thinking anything like that might
be<00:02:32.940> limited<00:02:33.420> because<00:02:33.600> of<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.380> light<00:02:35.280> duration

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
be limited because of the light duration

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.120 
be limited because of the light duration
of<00:02:36.209> the<00:02:36.510> drizzle<00:02:36.930> or<00:02:37.050> freezing<00:02:37.200> drizzle<00:02:37.500> so

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
of the drizzle or freezing drizzle so

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.520 
of the drizzle or freezing drizzle so
we're<00:02:38.850> into<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.270> low<00:02:39.480> to<00:02:39.540> moderate<00:02:39.990> area<00:02:40.290> for

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
we're into the low to moderate area for

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.430 
we're into the low to moderate area for
confidence<00:02:41.070> but<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.640> impacts<00:02:42.180> could<00:02:42.660> be<00:02:42.870> on

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
confidence but the impacts could be on

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.580 
confidence but the impacts could be on
the<00:02:43.620> moderate<00:02:44.040> size<00:02:44.730> across<00:02:45.240> most<00:02:45.630> areas<00:02:45.870> it

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
the moderate size across most areas it

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.070 
the moderate size across most areas it
all<00:02:46.770> is<00:02:46.950> going<00:02:47.130> to<00:02:47.220> depend<00:02:47.340> on<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:48.180> exact

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
all is going to depend on the exact

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.040 
all is going to depend on the exact
temperature<00:02:49.410> at<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.160> ground<00:02:50.630> when<00:02:51.630> the

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
temperature at the ground when the

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.570 
temperature at the ground when the
precipitation<00:02:52.770> is<00:02:52.980> falling<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:53.489> the

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
precipitation is falling and the

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.930 
precipitation is falling and the
heaviness<00:02:54.360> or<00:02:54.780> lack<00:02:55.320> of<00:02:55.350> it<00:02:55.650> as<00:02:55.800> far<00:02:56.459> as<00:02:56.670> the

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
heaviness or lack of it as far as the

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.140 
heaviness or lack of it as far as the
precipitation<00:02:57.630> type<00:02:58.020> so<00:02:58.860> on<00:02:59.310> our<00:02:59.520> range<00:02:59.820> from

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
precipitation type so on our range from

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.390 
precipitation type so on our range from
absolutely<00:03:00.690> nothing<00:03:00.810> happening<00:03:01.560> to<00:03:01.860> another

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
absolutely nothing happening to another

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.550 
absolutely nothing happening to another
big-time<00:03:02.880> winter<00:03:03.300> event<00:03:03.630> well<00:03:04.080> we're<00:03:04.350> a<00:03:04.380> lot

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
big-time winter event well we're a lot

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.560 
big-time winter event well we're a lot
closer<00:03:04.770> to<00:03:05.070> nothing<00:03:05.430> happening<00:03:05.850> so<00:03:06.390> our

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
closer to nothing happening so our

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.479 
closer to nothing happening so our
forecast<00:03:07.050> is<00:03:07.290> going<00:03:07.470> to<00:03:07.530> be<00:03:07.650> here<00:03:08.130> where<00:03:08.340> we

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
forecast is going to be here where we

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.640 
forecast is going to be here where we
areas<00:03:09.270> are<00:03:09.390> going<00:03:09.510> to<00:03:09.570> see<00:03:09.750> some<00:03:09.959> impacts<00:03:10.380> and

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
areas are going to see some impacts and

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.520 
areas are going to see some impacts and
we're<00:03:11.340> talking<00:03:11.670> travel<00:03:11.910> disruptions<00:03:12.690> as<00:03:12.989> well

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
we're talking travel disruptions as well

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.400 
we're talking travel disruptions as well
as<00:03:14.150> possible<00:03:15.150> power<00:03:15.300> outages<00:03:15.780> I<00:03:16.080> think<00:03:16.290> it's

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
as possible power outages I think it's

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.199 
as possible power outages I think it's
going<00:03:16.470> to<00:03:16.590> be<00:03:16.680> really<00:03:16.920> relatively<00:03:17.580> on<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:18.030> low

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
going to be really relatively on the low

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.300 
going to be really relatively on the low
side<00:03:18.450> but<00:03:18.510> this<00:03:19.260> is<00:03:19.500> definitely<00:03:19.709> a<00:03:19.920> system

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
side but this is definitely a system

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.770 
side but this is definitely a system
that<00:03:20.430> we<00:03:20.519> want<00:03:20.790> to<00:03:20.850> watch<00:03:20.970> and<00:03:21.480> we<00:03:21.690> are

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
that we want to watch and we are

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.360 
that we want to watch and we are
definitely<00:03:22.019> going<00:03:22.230> to<00:03:22.320> see<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:22.590> drizzle<00:03:22.950> just

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
definitely going to see the drizzle just

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.350 
definitely going to see the drizzle just
going<00:03:23.489> to<00:03:23.549> be<00:03:23.670> watching<00:03:23.850> those<00:03:24.120> temperatures

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
going to be watching those temperatures

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.259 
going to be watching those temperatures
fall<00:03:24.690> below<00:03:24.959> freezing<00:03:25.790> well<00:03:26.790> that's<00:03:26.970> it<00:03:27.120> for

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
fall below freezing well that's it for
