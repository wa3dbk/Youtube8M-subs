and<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.890> game<00:01:14.070> in<00:01:14.280> turn<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.700> old<00:01:14.820> mill<00:01:15.030> I

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
and the game in turn the old mill I

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.880 
and the game in turn the old mill I
should<00:01:15.720> have<00:01:15.810> went<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.110> for<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.470> top<00:01:16.650> left

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
should have went that for the top left

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.280 
should have went that for the top left
hand<00:01:17.009> corner<00:01:17.520> finish<00:01:18.210> because<00:01:18.720> then<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.110> had

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
probably won the game but I far let's go

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.609

them and I come up against a very paisa
side<00:01:27.180> with<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.420> five<00:01:27.780> at<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.020> back<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.590> he<00:01:28.979> will

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
side with a five at the back and he will

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.340 
side with a five at the back and he will
get<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.490> game<00:01:29.670> started<00:01:29.700> in<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.390> 34th<00:01:31.020> minute

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
get the game started in the 34th minute

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.090 
get the game started in the 34th minute
would<00:01:31.680> Hernandez<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.460> it's<00:01:33.090> one<00:01:33.570> nil<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.229> as

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
would Hernandez and it's one nil and as

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.429 
would Hernandez and it's one nil and as
you<00:01:35.220> can<00:01:35.340> see<00:01:35.369> here<00:01:35.700> he<00:01:35.880> does<00:01:36.090> contain<00:01:36.930> quite<00:01:37.380> a

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
you can see here he does contain quite a

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.740 
you can see here he does contain quite a
bit<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.189> he<00:01:38.430> did<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.970> entire<00:01:39.240> game<00:01:39.299> and

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
bit and he did that the entire game and

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.630 
bit and he did that the entire game and
it's<00:01:39.869> very<00:01:40.170> difficult<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.650> get<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.890> nice<00:01:41.130> skill

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
it's very difficult to get a nice skill

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.700 
it's very difficult to get a nice skill
goal<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:42.090> way<00:01:42.390> so<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:42.899> went<00:01:43.079> into<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.439> second

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
goal that way so I went into the second

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.960 
goal that way so I went into the second
half<00:01:43.740> with<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.040> completely<00:01:44.490> different

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
half with a completely different

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.660 
half with a completely different
approach<00:01:45.060> thinking<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:45.930> would<00:01:46.259> just<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.890> passing

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
approach thinking I would just a passing

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.219 
approach thinking I would just a passing
them<00:01:47.759> out<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.090> go<00:01:48.299> for<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.600> win<00:01:48.750> instead<00:01:49.110> of

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
them out and go for the win instead of

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.499 
them out and go for the win instead of
doing<00:01:49.530> skill<00:01:49.829> moves<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.090> seemed<00:01:51.299> to

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
doing skill moves and that is seemed to

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.749 
doing skill moves and that is seemed to
pay<00:01:51.780> off<00:01:51.810> he<00:01:52.409> are<00:01:52.530> finding<00:01:52.890> Carlos<00:01:53.070> Eduardo<00:01:53.310> to

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
move on to the Scandinavian side and I

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.340 
move on to the Scandinavian side and I
come<00:03:05.610> up<00:03:05.730> against<00:03:06.000> this<00:03:06.300> squad<00:03:06.810> very<00:03:07.080> strong

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
come up against this squad very strong

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.770 
come up against this squad very strong
defence<00:03:07.680> and<00:03:07.890> midfield<00:03:07.920> messy<00:03:08.880> Tia<00:03:09.240> Maria<00:03:09.360> and

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
defence and midfield messy Tia Maria and

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.930 
defence and midfield messy Tia Maria and
Lavezzi<00:03:10.260> in<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.560> attack<00:03:10.890> and<00:03:11.040> I<00:03:11.100> thought<00:03:11.310> this

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
Lavezzi in the attack and I thought this

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.970 
Lavezzi in the attack and I thought this
is<00:03:12.000> going<00:03:12.330> to<00:03:12.540> be<00:03:12.660> a<00:03:12.690> very<00:03:12.810> difficult<00:03:13.410> game<00:03:13.950> I

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:03.729 
similar side because he did also have

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:05.820

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
started here in the first minute wood

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.070 
started here in the first minute wood
slats<00:05:13.060> and<00:05:13.150> some<00:05:13.360> nice<00:05:13.540> stuff<00:05:13.780> there<00:05:14.050> but
