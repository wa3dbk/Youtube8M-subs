they're not producing the alloy which is

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.340 
they're not producing the alloy which is
the<00:01:29.790> reason<00:01:30.210> why<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.390> can<00:01:30.720> run<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.930> negative

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350

one area now here's the other trick I
made<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.190> so<00:02:26.670> they're<00:02:26.819> on<00:02:26.910> roads<00:02:27.270> that<00:02:27.660> they

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
made it so they're on roads that they

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.050 
made it so they're on roads that they
can<00:02:28.020> do<00:02:28.110> u-turns<00:02:28.530> on<00:02:28.830> they<00:02:29.220> can<00:02:29.370> turn<00:02:29.520> left<00:02:29.819> or

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
can do u-turns on they can turn left or

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.650 
can do u-turns on they can turn left or
right<00:02:30.180> at<00:02:30.690> any<00:02:30.959> get<00:02:31.770> any<00:02:32.010> given<00:02:32.430> second<00:02:32.850> so<00:02:33.420> on

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
right at any get any given second so on

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.380 
right at any get any given second so on
these<00:02:33.870> larger<00:02:34.590> highways<00:02:35.340> right<00:02:36.180> these

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
these larger highways right these

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.449 
these larger highways right these
avenues<00:02:36.840> sometimes<00:02:37.410> they<00:02:37.560> can't<00:02:37.860> make<00:02:38.100> a<00:02:38.130> left

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
avenues sometimes they can't make a left

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:39.979 
avenues sometimes they can't make a left
or<00:02:38.640> they<00:02:38.760> can't<00:02:39.000> make<00:02:39.240> a<00:02:39.270> u-turn

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
or they can't make a u-turn

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.680

realized<00:03:50.430> that<00:03:50.549> hey<00:03:50.760> man<00:03:50.940> for<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:51.870> cost<00:03:52.140> of

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
realized that hey man for the cost of

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.640 
realized that hey man for the cost of
money<00:03:52.470> I<00:03:52.739> can<00:03:53.040> import<00:03:53.640> the<00:03:53.850> stuff<00:03:54.090> myself<00:03:54.650> both

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
money I can import the stuff myself both

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.610 
money I can import the stuff myself both
items<00:03:56.100> make<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:56.940> cocktail<00:03:57.510> export<00:03:58.440> it<00:03:58.530> and

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
items make the cocktail export it and

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.850 
items make the cocktail export it and
still<00:03:58.980> make<00:03:59.209> profit<00:04:00.320> that's<00:04:01.320> great

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
still make profit that's great

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.800 
still make profit that's great
right<00:04:02.459> now<00:04:02.640> I<00:04:02.670> don't<00:04:02.820> need<00:04:02.970> to<00:04:03.030> pollute<00:04:03.299> the

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
right now I don't need to pollute the

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.449 
right now I don't need to pollute the
other<00:04:03.959> half<00:04:04.230> of<00:04:04.350> my<00:04:04.440> city<00:04:04.680> with<00:04:04.890> mines<00:04:05.160> and<00:04:05.400> I

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
other half of my city with mines and I

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.100 
other half of my city with mines and I
can<00:04:05.610> focus<00:04:05.820> on<00:04:06.120> this<00:04:06.269> just<00:04:06.540> being<00:04:06.780> a

can focus on this just being a

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.030 
can focus on this just being a

I<00:04:25.160> literally<00:04:26.160> removed<00:04:26.970> and

I literally removed and
moved<00:04:27.630> everything<00:04:28.200> the<00:04:28.680> poopoo<00:04:29.010> plants

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
moved everything the poopoo plants

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.430 
moved everything the poopoo plants
they're<00:04:29.970> both<00:04:30.360> down<00:04:30.630> here<00:04:30.990> why<00:04:31.170> do<00:04:31.230> you<00:04:31.350> have

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
they're both down here why do you have

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.260 
they're both down here why do you have
two<00:04:31.650> because<00:04:31.980> you<00:04:32.160> need<00:04:32.460> two<00:04:32.730> I've<00:04:32.940> got<00:04:32.970> a<00:04:33.120> lot

two because you need two I've got a lot

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.730 
two because you need two I've got a lot
of<00:04:33.300> excess<00:04:33.720> but<00:04:33.990> what<00:04:34.140> happens<00:04:34.440> when<00:04:34.560> you're

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
of excess but what happens when you're

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.070 
of excess but what happens when you're
big<00:04:34.980> in<00:04:35.010> the<00:04:35.190> smelting<00:04:35.640> game<00:04:35.820> these<00:04:36.420> bad<00:04:36.780> boys

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
big in the smelting game these bad boys

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.450 
big in the smelting game these bad boys
produce<00:04:37.710> just<00:04:38.400> tons<00:04:39.000> of<00:04:39.420> waste<00:04:40.310> the<00:04:41.310> water

facility<00:04:42.150> I<00:04:42.270> can<00:04:42.510> get<00:04:42.630> away<00:04:42.720> with<00:04:42.960> one<00:04:43.200> and<00:04:43.500> you

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
facility I can get away with one and you

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.190 
facility I can get away with one and you
know<00:04:44.550> that's<00:04:45.000> the<00:04:45.180> other<00:04:45.270> thing<00:04:45.390> I've<00:04:45.810> got<00:04:46.170> a

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
know that's the other thing I've got a

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.870 
know that's the other thing I've got a
little<00:04:46.380> extra<00:04:46.530> but<00:04:47.160> not<00:04:47.340> bad

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
little extra but not bad

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.270 
little extra but not bad
the<00:04:48.090> power<00:04:48.360> I<00:04:48.720> definitely<00:04:49.470> need<00:04:49.620> to<00:04:49.650> I've<00:04:50.100> got

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
the power I definitely need to I've got

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.620 
the power I definitely need to I've got
some<00:04:50.490> of<00:04:50.610> this<00:04:50.700> one<00:04:50.910> turned<00:04:51.120> off<00:04:51.300> but<00:04:51.510> these

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
some of this one turned off but these

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.020 
some of this one turned off but these
smelting<00:04:52.080> plants<00:04:52.380> are<00:04:52.470> such<00:04:52.680> power<00:04:52.980> hogs<00:04:53.340> it's

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
smelting plants are such power hogs it's

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.660 
smelting plants are such power hogs it's
absolutely<00:04:54.660> insane<00:04:55.130> so<00:04:56.130> it's<00:04:56.280> something<00:04:56.520> that

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.670 
absolutely insane so it's something that

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.280 
absolutely insane so it's something that
you<00:04:56.910> have<00:04:57.090> to<00:04:57.210> keep<00:04:57.360> your<00:04:57.570> eye<00:04:57.600> on<00:04:57.780> look<00:04:58.230> at

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
you have to keep your eye on look at

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.500 
you have to keep your eye on look at
that<00:04:58.350> just<00:04:58.560> turn<00:04:58.740> off<00:04:58.860> two<00:04:59.130> and<00:04:59.460> I<00:05:00.240> don't<00:05:00.300> have

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
that just turn off two and I don't have

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.390 
that just turn off two and I don't have
a<00:05:00.540> lot<00:05:00.720> of<00:05:00.750> access<00:05:01.260> even<00:05:01.860> though<00:05:01.950> it<00:05:02.040> says<00:05:02.220> I<00:05:02.340> do

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
a lot of access even though it says I do

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.850 
a lot of access even though it says I do
I<00:05:02.700> really<00:05:02.970> don't<00:05:03.210> because<00:05:03.660> the<00:05:04.080> the<00:05:04.500> smelting

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
I really don't because the the smelting

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.830 
I really don't because the the smelting
plants<00:05:05.130> will<00:05:05.250> start<00:05:05.280> shutting<00:05:05.910> down<00:05:05.940> that's

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
plants will start shutting down that's

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.900 
plants will start shutting down that's
another<00:05:07.050> thing<00:05:07.290> that<00:05:07.440> I<00:05:07.470> learned<00:05:07.740> is<00:05:08.010> your

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
another thing that I learned is your

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.450 
another thing that I learned is your
power<00:05:09.150> draw<00:05:09.480> got<00:05:10.020> to<00:05:10.140> be<00:05:10.230> careful<00:05:10.440> when<00:05:11.190> I<00:05:11.220> just

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
power draw got to be careful when I just

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.950 
power draw got to be careful when I just
had<00:05:11.550> this<00:05:11.760> power<00:05:12.030> plant<00:05:12.240> over<00:05:12.510> here<00:05:12.540> when<00:05:12.930> I

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
had this power plant over here when I

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.630 
had this power plant over here when I
had<00:05:13.140> three<00:05:13.380> smelting<00:05:13.800> plants<00:05:14.070> it<00:05:14.220> was<00:05:14.340> enough

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640 
had three smelting plants it was enough

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.420 
had three smelting plants it was enough
but<00:05:15.450> it's<00:05:15.690> like<00:05:15.870> it<00:05:15.990> wasn't<00:05:16.410> close<00:05:16.710> enough<00:05:16.740> so

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
but it's like it wasn't close enough so

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.790 
but it's like it wasn't close enough so
I<00:05:17.490> moved<00:05:17.880> one<00:05:18.210> the<00:05:18.990> other<00:05:19.110> one<00:05:19.290> might<00:05:19.500> follow

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
I moved one the other one might follow

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.770 
I moved one the other one might follow
suit<00:05:20.160> and<00:05:20.310> sit<00:05:20.520> next<00:05:20.670> to<00:05:20.820> that<00:05:20.970> very<00:05:21.180> shortly<00:05:21.570> I

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
suit and sit next to that very shortly I

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.590 
suit and sit next to that very shortly I
don't<00:05:22.080> know<00:05:22.290> yet<00:05:22.910> when<00:05:23.910> you<00:05:24.060> watch<00:05:24.270> another

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 
don't know yet when you watch another

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.480 
don't know yet when you watch another
video<00:05:25.020> I'm<00:05:25.260> gonna<00:05:25.470> change<00:05:25.770> our<00:05:25.950> city<00:05:26.130> again

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
video I'm gonna change our city again

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.610 
video I'm gonna change our city again
and<00:05:26.730> work<00:05:27.030> on<00:05:27.270> the<00:05:27.570> density<00:05:27.960> of<00:05:27.990> this<00:05:28.230> area

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
and work on the density of this area

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.950 
and work on the density of this area
more<00:05:29.190> traffic<00:05:29.490> issues<00:05:30.060> and<00:05:30.330> more<00:05:30.480> importantly

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
more traffic issues and more importantly

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.220 
more traffic issues and more importantly
start<00:05:31.650> to<00:05:31.800> make<00:05:32.280> this<00:05:32.550> a<00:05:32.760> dense<00:05:33.060> area<00:05:33.420> by
