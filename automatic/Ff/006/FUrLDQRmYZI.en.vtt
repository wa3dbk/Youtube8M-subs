completely crazy but these docs have
living<00:00:32.880> examples<00:00:33.329> built<00:00:33.540> into<00:00:33.750> them<00:00:33.899> so

put its own clever xml viewer logic here
I<00:01:05.189> don't<00:01:05.400> really<00:01:05.489> like<00:01:05.640> any<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.210> what<00:01:06.390> they<00:01:06.510> do

search and the time range and everything

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.679 
search and the time range and everything
is<00:01:49.380> now<00:01:49.500> given<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.070> table<00:01:50.490> which<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.420> inside

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
is now given to a table which is inside

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.780 
is now given to a table which is inside
a<00:01:51.750> pager<00:01:52.020> this<00:01:52.920> will<00:01:53.040> render<00:01:53.280> out<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.579> little

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
a pager this will render out a little

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.499 
a pager this will render out a little
table<00:01:54.329> so<00:01:54.930> every<00:01:55.140> time<00:01:56.180> every<00:01:57.180> time<00:01:57.299> you

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
table so every time every time you

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.910 
table so every time every time you
change<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.840> pulldown<00:01:58.110> it'll<00:01:58.530> render<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.770> new

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
change the pulldown it'll render a new

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.319 
change the pulldown it'll render a new
table<00:02:01.219> that's<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.399> let's<00:02:02.610> go<00:02:02.729> back<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.090> look

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
table that's it let's go back and look

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.289 
table that's it let's go back and look
at<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.540> view<00:02:03.570> again<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:04.649> here's<00:02:04.860> our<00:02:04.979> example

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
at the view again so here's our example

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.150 
at the view again so here's our example
again<00:02:06.299> this<00:02:06.390> is<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.570> dynamic<00:02:06.869> pull<00:02:07.680> down<00:02:07.860> one

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
again this is the dynamic pull down one

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.859 
again this is the dynamic pull down one
so<00:02:08.340> it's<00:02:08.459> just<00:02:08.610> showing<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.119> most<00:02:09.420> simple

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
so it's just showing you the most simple

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.870 
so it's just showing you the most simple
example<00:02:10.319> of<00:02:10.670> how<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.730> render<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.480> then<00:02:12.599> you

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
example of how to render and then you

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.260 
example of how to render and then you
who's<00:02:12.970> a<00:02:13.210> dynamic<00:02:14.110> pulled<00:02:14.320> on<00:02:15.000> always<00:02:16.000> over<00:02:16.180> on

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
who's a dynamic pulled on always over on

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.340 
who's a dynamic pulled on always over on
the<00:02:16.360> right<00:02:16.510> they'll<00:02:16.720> be<00:02:16.780> notice<00:02:17.080> about<00:02:17.230> the

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
the right they'll be notice about the

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.930 
the right they'll be notice about the
particular<00:02:17.530> config<00:02:17.950> introducing<00:02:18.640> any<00:02:18.790> new

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.670 
pages are stitched together into a
linear<00:02:25.150> flow<00:02:25.450> so<00:02:25.900> you<00:02:25.990> see<00:02:26.110> here<00:02:26.200> this<00:02:26.350> example

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
linear flow so you see here this example

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.200 
linear flow so you see here this example
builds<00:02:27.130> on<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.310> previous<00:02:27.460> example<00:02:28.860> for<00:02:29.860> the

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
builds on the previous example for the

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.190 
builds on the previous example for the

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
through that linear flow and look at all

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.580 
through that linear flow and look at all
the<00:02:33.850> examples<00:02:34.300> and<00:02:34.450> skim<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:34.810> xml<00:02:35.200> source<00:02:35.410> for

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
across different side view modules you

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.030 
across different side view modules you
can<00:03:25.840> you<00:03:26.140> can<00:03:26.290> see<00:03:26.470> it<00:03:26.560> that<00:03:26.680> way<00:03:26.800> too<00:03:29.040> let's

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
can you can see it that way too let's

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.480 
can you can see it that way too let's
look<00:03:30.130> at<00:03:30.250> the<00:03:30.310> inline<00:03:30.730> drill<00:03:31.030> down<00:03:31.180> page<00:03:32.490> here

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.490 
look at the inline drill down page here

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.040 
look at the inline drill down page here
shows<00:03:33.700> a<00:03:33.730> configuration<00:03:33.910> where<00:03:34.390> clicking<00:03:34.930> or

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
shows a configuration where clicking or

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.470 
shows a configuration where clicking or
drilling<00:03:35.530> down<00:03:35.770> on<00:03:36.070> a<00:03:36.700> table<00:03:36.970> runs<00:03:37.300> another

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
drilling down on a table runs another

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.640 
drilling down on a table runs another
search<00:03:37.810> and<00:03:38.110> just<00:03:38.290> blaze<00:03:38.470> that<00:03:38.680> in<00:03:38.920> a<00:03:39.460> chart<00:03:40.650> as

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
search and just blaze that in a chart as

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:42.870 
search and just blaze that in a chart as
you<00:03:41.770> can<00:03:41.860> see<00:03:42.040> if<00:03:42.190> I<00:03:42.310> click<00:03:42.520> on<00:03:42.670> access

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
you can see if I click on access

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.820 
you can see if I click on access
combined<00:03:43.360> it<00:03:43.510> runs<00:03:43.690> a<00:03:43.810> search<00:03:44.020> chest<00:03:44.590> it<00:03:44.709> up

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
combined it runs a search chest it up

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:53.510 
combined it runs a search chest it up
that

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.660 

so<00:03:54.150> let's<00:03:54.330> look<00:03:54.360> at<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:54.570> XML<00:03:54.840> again<00:03:55.050> and<00:03:56.040> again

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
so let's look at the XML again and again

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.490 
so let's look at the XML again and again
we'll<00:03:56.850> do<00:03:56.910> it<00:03:57.000> side-by-side<00:03:57.180> the<00:03:58.170> app<00:03:58.290> tells

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
we'll do it side-by-side the app tells

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.600 
we'll do it side-by-side the app tells
you<00:03:58.680> that<00:03:59.010> this<00:03:59.160> is<00:03:59.310> you<00:03:59.430> know<00:03:59.520> the

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
recommended way of viewing it so again a

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.850 
recommended way of viewing it so again a
