basically we're gonna have a click track
alright<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:17.010> typically<00:00:17.430> when<00:00:17.609> you<00:00:17.730> hear<00:00:17.910> a

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
alright and typically when you hear a

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:18.500 
alright and typically when you hear a
click

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
reason I struggle so much for this let's

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:33.050 
reason I struggle so much for this let's
see<00:02:02.909> if<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.119> can<00:02:03.329> get<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.659> first<00:02:03.810> time<00:02:32.060> I'm

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
see if I can get it the first time I'm

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.390 
see if I can get it the first time I'm
doing<00:02:33.180> a<00:02:33.360> lot<00:02:33.599> of<00:02:33.750> concentration<00:02:34.110> alright<00:02:34.680> so

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
doing a lot of concentration alright so

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.470 
doing a lot of concentration alright so
the<00:02:35.489> whole<00:02:35.640> point<00:02:35.879> of<00:02:35.940> this<00:02:36.060> is<00:02:36.120> so<00:02:36.330> that<00:02:36.360> you

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
the whole point of this is so that you

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.960 
the whole point of this is so that you
can<00:02:36.599> do<00:02:36.810> this<00:02:36.900> with<00:02:37.080> a<00:02:37.110> drummer<00:02:37.500> it's<00:02:38.099> kind<00:02:38.879> of

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
can do this with a drummer it's kind of

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.850 
can do this with a drummer it's kind of
like<00:02:39.629> I<00:02:39.750> said<00:02:39.900> it's<00:02:40.019> kind<00:02:40.170> of<00:02:40.260> tricky<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:40.590> do

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
like I said it's kind of tricky to do

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.220 
like I said it's kind of tricky to do
but<00:02:41.849> once<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:42.150> kind<00:02:42.330> of<00:02:42.420> are<00:02:42.660> comfortable<00:02:43.170> on

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
but once you kind of are comfortable on

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.150 
but once you kind of are comfortable on
the<00:02:43.349> click<00:02:43.590> go<00:02:43.739> ahead<00:02:43.890> and<00:02:43.980> wean<00:02:44.069> yourself

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
into a drum machine

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.750 
into a drum machine
you<00:02:46.290> know<00:02:46.410> sequence<00:02:46.769> of<00:02:46.890> beat<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:47.160> try<00:02:47.340> try
