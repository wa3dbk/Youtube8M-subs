00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:42.609 
inspected the frames and I make sure

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:43.800 
inspected the frames and I make sure
they're<00:01:42.759> okay<00:01:43.090> and<00:01:43.119> they're<00:01:43.299> not<00:01:43.389> rusty<00:01:43.719> and

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:48.249 
I'll then move on to the moving parts

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:50.489 
I'll then move on to the moving parts
that<00:01:48.399> on<00:01:48.729> that<00:01:48.969> are<00:01:49.119> on<00:01:49.209> the<00:01:49.299> chassis<00:01:49.509> and<00:01:50.349> that

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:50.499 
that on that are on the chassis and that

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:52.499 
that on that are on the chassis and that
includes<00:01:50.889> the<00:01:50.979> swing<00:01:51.249> arm<00:01:51.450> all<00:01:52.450> the

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
includes the swing arm all the

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.499 
includes the swing arm all the
suspension<00:01:53.139> linkages<00:01:53.619> the<00:01:54.179> mono<00:01:55.179> shock

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
suspension linkages the mono shock

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.129 
suspension linkages the mono shock
mounts<00:01:55.959> and<00:01:56.579> of<00:01:57.579> course<00:01:57.849> will<00:01:58.450> bearings<00:01:58.959> as

00:01:59.129 --> 00:01:59.139 
mounts and of course will bearings as

00:01:59.139 --> 00:02:00.809 
mounts and of course will bearings as
well<00:01:59.319> once<00:01:59.950> we<00:02:00.039> have<00:02:00.159> the<00:02:00.219> wheel<00:02:00.369> bearings

00:02:00.809 --> 00:02:00.819 
well once we have the wheel bearings

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:02.639 
well once we have the wheel bearings
I'll<00:02:00.999> then<00:02:01.179> take<00:02:01.749> the<00:02:01.869> forks<00:02:02.169> off<00:02:02.349> the<00:02:02.469> front

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
I'll then take the forks off the front

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:05.159 
I'll then take the forks off the front
of<00:02:02.770> the<00:02:02.829> bike<00:02:03.009> and<00:02:03.569> which<00:02:04.569> of<00:02:04.719> these<00:02:04.809> things

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:05.169 
of the bike and which of these things

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:08.010 
of the bike and which of these things
here<00:02:05.639> these<00:02:06.639> are<00:02:06.819> the<00:02:06.880> forks<00:02:07.239> they<00:02:07.599> go<00:02:07.749> up<00:02:07.869> into

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
here these are the forks they go up into

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.289 
here these are the forks they go up into
these<00:02:08.200> triple<00:02:08.560> clamps<00:02:08.890> and<00:02:09.099> the<00:02:10.030> triple

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:10.299 
these triple clamps and the triple

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:12.809 
these triple clamps and the triple
clamps<00:02:10.569> are<00:02:11.319> basically<00:02:11.650> steer<00:02:12.040> within<00:02:12.489> the

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
clamps are basically steer within the

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.700 
clamps are basically steer within the
chassis<00:02:13.239> so<00:02:13.569> they<00:02:13.719> have<00:02:13.930> barrington<00:02:14.379> as<00:02:14.500> well

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
chassis so they have barrington as well

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.110 
chassis so they have barrington as well
I'm<00:02:14.980> going<00:02:15.100> to<00:02:15.160> change<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:15.610> head<00:02:15.940> race

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
I'm going to change the head race

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.270 
I'm going to change the head race
bearings<00:02:16.600> so<00:02:17.350> with<00:02:17.470> all<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.710> ball<00:02:17.860> bearings

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
bearings so with all the ball bearings

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.680 
bearings so with all the ball bearings
all<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.850> spring<00:02:19.000> arm<00:02:19.180> bearings<00:02:19.540> all<00:02:19.630> the

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
all the spring arm bearings all the

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.060 
all the spring arm bearings all the
suspension<00:02:20.050> bearings<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.710> head<00:02:20.890> race

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
suspension bearings the head race

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.710 
suspension bearings the head race
bearings<00:02:21.550> and<00:02:21.760> then<00:02:22.120> once<00:02:22.240> I've<00:02:22.390> done<00:02:22.540> all<00:02:22.690> of

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
bearings and then once I've done all of

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.800 
bearings and then once I've done all of
that<00:02:22.870> I'll<00:02:23.530> then<00:02:23.770> move<00:02:23.980> on<00:02:24.130> to<00:02:24.160> the<00:02:24.340> brakes

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
that I'll then move on to the brakes

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.480 
that I'll then move on to the brakes
yeah<00:02:25.870> I<00:02:26.020> think<00:02:26.260> my<00:02:26.350> first<00:02:26.590> mechanical<00:02:27.010> spear

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
yeah I think my first mechanical spear

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.730 
yeah I think my first mechanical spear
and<00:02:27.580> it's<00:02:27.670> just<00:02:27.820> when<00:02:27.910> I<00:02:27.940> was<00:02:28.060> about<00:02:28.740> maybe

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
and it's just when I was about maybe

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.390 
and it's just when I was about maybe
eight<00:02:30.340> or<00:02:30.580> nine<00:02:30.790> years<00:02:31.060> old<00:02:31.210> and<00:02:31.830> as<00:02:32.830> a<00:02:32.890> present

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
eight or nine years old and as a present

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.570 
eight or nine years old and as a present
for<00:02:33.610> me<00:02:33.760> my<00:02:33.880> dad<00:02:34.030> bought<00:02:34.300> me<00:02:34.510> a<00:02:34.720> moped<00:02:35.430> but<00:02:36.430> what

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
for me my dad bought me a moped but what

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.280 
for me my dad bought me a moped but what
he<00:02:36.640> didn't<00:02:36.910> tell<00:02:36.940> me<00:02:37.090> was<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.630> moped<00:02:37.990> was<00:02:38.140> in

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
he didn't tell me was the moped was in

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.840 
he didn't tell me was the moped was in
bits<00:02:38.530> so<00:02:38.860> he<00:02:38.950> took<00:02:39.100> me<00:02:39.190> to<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.370> garage<00:02:39.700> and

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
bits so he took me to the garage and

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.540 
bits so he took me to the garage and
there's<00:02:40.030> just<00:02:40.210> this<00:02:40.300> old<00:02:40.510> blue<00:02:40.870> frame<00:02:41.200> and<00:02:41.590> two

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
there's just this old blue frame and two

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.050 
there's just this old blue frame and two
boxes<00:02:42.970> of<00:02:43.150> bits<00:02:43.390> and<00:02:43.950> I<00:02:44.950> was<00:02:45.700> really<00:02:45.880> excited

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
boxes of bits and I was really excited

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.280 
boxes of bits and I was really excited
thinking<00:02:46.330> that's<00:02:46.600> kind<00:02:46.720> of<00:02:46.750> a<00:02:46.840> motorbike<00:02:47.230> but

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
thinking that's kind of a motorbike but

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.830 
thinking that's kind of a motorbike but
I<00:02:47.740> think<00:02:48.610> that<00:02:48.760> was<00:02:48.850> my<00:02:48.970> training<00:02:49.240> really<00:02:49.720> he

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
I think that was my training really he

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.300 
I think that was my training really he
said<00:02:50.050> you<00:02:50.290> can<00:02:50.410> have<00:02:50.530> this<00:02:50.650> motorbike<00:02:50.920> if<00:02:51.220> you

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
said you can have this motorbike if you

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.670 
said you can have this motorbike if you
put<00:02:51.490> it<00:02:51.580> back<00:02:51.670> together<00:02:51.850> so<00:02:52.300> I<00:02:52.540> laid<00:02:53.410> with<00:02:53.440> a

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
put it back together so I laid with a

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.260 
put it back together so I laid with a
bit<00:02:53.830> sound<00:02:54.070> worked<00:02:54.310> out<00:02:54.520> what<00:02:54.730> connected<00:02:55.150> to<00:02:55.240> I

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
bit sound worked out what connected to I

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.430 
bit sound worked out what connected to I
