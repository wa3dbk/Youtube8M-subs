okay<00:00:01.319> one<00:00:01.560> more<00:00:01.740> look<00:00:01.920> at<00:00:02.100> the<00:00:02.280> power-steering

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
okay one more look at the power-steering

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.849 
okay one more look at the power-steering
wicked<00:00:03.810> power<00:00:03.990> steering

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
wicked power steering

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.820 
wicked power steering
if<00:00:05.370> you<00:00:05.460> look<00:00:05.670> here<00:00:06.500> actually<00:00:07.500> we're<00:00:07.710> gonna

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
if you look here actually we're gonna

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.450 
if you look here actually we're gonna
start<00:00:08.040> up<00:00:08.099> at<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.250> top<00:00:08.309> we<00:00:09.179> got<00:00:09.330> the<00:00:10.460> steering

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
start up at the top we got the steering

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.879 
start up at the top we got the steering
shaft<00:00:11.490> here<00:00:12.000> you<00:00:12.660> can<00:00:12.840> see<00:00:13.049> that<00:00:13.259> it's<00:00:13.559> still

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
shaft here you can see that it's still

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.340 
shaft here you can see that it's still
if<00:00:14.280> you<00:00:14.400> look<00:00:14.429> up<00:00:14.730> near<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.000> top<00:00:18.020> that<00:00:19.020> is<00:00:19.320> a

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
if you look up near the top that is a

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.170 
if you look up near the top that is a
little<00:00:19.710> bit<00:00:19.800> short<00:00:20.189> so<00:00:20.580> we're<00:00:20.760> coming<00:00:20.970> up<00:00:21.060> a

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
little bit short so we're coming up a

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.400 
little bit short so we're coming up a
little<00:00:21.330> bit<00:00:21.480> short<00:00:21.750> on<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.960> steering<00:00:22.380> shaft

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
little bit short on the steering shaft

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.830 
little bit short on the steering shaft
and<00:00:22.830> that's<00:00:23.430> even<00:00:23.789> when<00:00:24.090> I<00:00:24.119> push<00:00:24.359> it<00:00:24.449> up<00:00:24.539> that's

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
and that's even when I push it up that's

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.450 
and that's even when I push it up that's
a<00:00:25.199> little<00:00:25.320> more<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:25.650> could<00:00:25.949> pry<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.279> little

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
a little more I could pry it a little

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
a little more I could pry it a little
bit<00:00:26.550> closer<00:00:26.760> but<00:00:27.000> we're<00:00:27.150> still<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.359> little

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
bit closer but we're still a little

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.080 
bit closer but we're still a little
short<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:28.769> next<00:00:29.099> thing<00:00:29.460> that<00:00:29.490> I'm<00:00:29.760> seeing<00:00:30.090> is

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
short the next thing that I'm seeing is

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.280 
short the next thing that I'm seeing is
back<00:00:33.090> in<00:00:33.329> here<00:00:34.340> see<00:00:35.340> this<00:00:35.489> -<00:00:35.670> well<00:00:35.850> but<00:00:36.090> back<00:00:37.079> up

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
back in here see this - well but back up

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.200 
back in here see this - well but back up
in<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.590> top<00:00:37.829> here<00:00:38.100> backside<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.760> heatsink

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
in the top here backside of the heatsink

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.450 
in the top here backside of the heatsink
that<00:00:39.690> plug<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.110> touching<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:42.079> that<00:00:43.079> plug

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
that plug is touching the that plug

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.700 
that plug is touching the that plug
mechanism<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:45.300> that's<00:00:45.510> definitely<00:00:45.809> too<00:00:46.350> close

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
mechanism so that's definitely too close

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.100 
mechanism so that's definitely too close
it<00:00:47.100> used<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.640> have<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.329> little<00:00:48.510> bit<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.750> gap<00:00:48.930> on

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
it used to have a little bit of a gap on

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.810 
it used to have a little bit of a gap on
the<00:00:49.140> other<00:00:49.350> one<00:00:49.500> makes<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.190> really<00:00:50.460> hard<00:00:50.730> to

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
the other one makes it really hard to

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.840 
the other one makes it really hard to
install<00:00:51.239> so<00:00:52.170> this<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.590> 2012<00:00:53.160> frame<00:00:53.579> on<00:00:53.730> the

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
install so this is the 2012 frame on the

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.510 
install so this is the 2012 frame on the
commander<00:00:54.449> they<00:00:54.539> replaced<00:00:54.930> my<00:00:55.140> 2011<00:00:55.980> frame<00:00:56.219> so

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
commander they replaced my 2011 frame so

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.880 
commander they replaced my 2011 frame so
it<00:00:57.210> wasn't<00:00:57.600> like<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.840> on<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.050> other<00:00:58.140> one<00:00:58.320> and

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
it wasn't like that on the other one and

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.529 
it wasn't like that on the other one and
you<00:00:59.010> can<00:00:59.100> see<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.250> already<00:00:59.399> drilled<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.969> hole

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
you can see I already drilled the hole

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.289 
you can see I already drilled the hole
here<00:01:00.870> for<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:01.890> one<00:01:02.030> and<00:01:04.790> what<00:01:05.790> I'm<00:01:05.909> gonna<00:01:06.060> do

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
here for that one and what I'm gonna do

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.109 
here for that one and what I'm gonna do
to<00:01:06.720> correct<00:01:07.170> this<00:01:07.610> obviously<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.700> different

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
to correct this obviously a different

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.410 
to correct this obviously a different
mount<00:01:09.420> would<00:01:09.600> work<00:01:09.869> but<00:01:10.760> kind<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:12.060> pinch

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
mount would work but kind of in a pinch

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.000 
mount would work but kind of in a pinch
for<00:01:12.479> time<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.110> don't<00:01:13.290> want<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.530> cut<00:01:13.740> up<00:01:13.770> too

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
for time and I don't want to cut up too

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.440 
for time and I don't want to cut up too
much<00:01:14.159> on<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.369> frame<00:01:14.640> especially<00:01:15.060> this<00:01:15.180> bigger

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
much on the frame especially this bigger

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.179 
much on the frame especially this bigger
hole<00:01:15.689> so<00:01:16.020> what<00:01:16.619> I'm<00:01:16.710> gonna<00:01:16.799> do<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.040> I'm<00:01:17.100> going

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
hole so what I'm gonna do is I'm going

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.330 
hole so what I'm gonna do is I'm going
to<00:01:17.250> leave<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:18.000> top<00:01:18.299> hole<00:01:18.630> where<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:19.470> this

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
to leave the top hole where it is this

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.980 
to leave the top hole where it is this
hole<00:01:20.610> I'll<00:01:20.820> leave<00:01:21.030> where<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.689> then

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
hole I'll leave where it is and then

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.090 
hole I'll leave where it is and then
I'll<00:01:22.110> drill<00:01:22.350> out<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.560> other<00:01:22.710> side<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:23.040> the

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
I'll drill out the other side of the

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.039 
I'll drill out the other side of the
mounting<00:01:23.430> bracket<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:23.880> then<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.689> bottom

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
mounting bracket and then the bottom

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.219 
mounting bracket and then the bottom
hole<00:01:25.170> I'm<00:01:25.350> going<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.560> drill<00:01:26.479> 3/8<00:01:27.479> towards<00:01:28.049> me

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
hole I'm going to drill 3/8 towards me

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.990 
hole I'm going to drill 3/8 towards me
so<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.950> bottom<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.400> this<00:01:29.520> bracket<00:01:29.700> could

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
so the bottom of this bracket could

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.270 
so the bottom of this bracket could
swing<00:01:30.240> out<00:01:30.450> that'll<00:01:31.320> do<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.470> couple<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.860> things

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
swing out that'll do a couple of things

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.640 
swing out that'll do a couple of things
I've<00:01:32.520> noticed<00:01:32.909> there<00:01:33.329> if<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.229> look<00:01:34.380> at<00:01:34.530> this

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
I've noticed there if you look at this

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.440 
I've noticed there if you look at this
lower<00:01:34.909> steering<00:01:35.909> shaft<00:01:37.430> this<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.970> bolt<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.420> in

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
lower steering shaft this the bolt is in

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.240 
lower steering shaft this the bolt is in
the<00:01:39.659> bottom<00:01:39.960> so<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.170> can<00:01:40.200> see<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:40.950> can<00:01:41.009> see<00:01:41.100> I

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
the bottom so I can see it you can see I

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.539 
the bottom so I can see it you can see I
got<00:01:41.460> actually<00:01:42.030> I'm<00:01:42.420> on<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.780> high<00:01:42.930> side<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.549> if

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
got actually I'm on the high side and if

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.730 
got actually I'm on the high side and if
you<00:01:44.700> see<00:01:44.850> through<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.119> hole<00:01:45.270> there<00:01:45.509> but<00:01:46.140> it's

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
you see through the hole there but it's

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.620 
you see through the hole there but it's
just<00:01:46.950> barely<00:01:47.310> gonna<00:01:47.579> push<00:01:47.850> down<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.420> make<00:01:48.600> it

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
just barely gonna push down to make it

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.260 
just barely gonna push down to make it
fit<00:01:48.979> so<00:01:50.210> basically<00:01:51.740> if<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:53.310> swing<00:01:53.729> this<00:01:53.909> away

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
fit so basically if I swing this away

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.480 
fit so basically if I swing this away
it'll<00:01:55.229> do<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.380> couple<00:01:55.710> of<00:01:55.770> things<00:01:55.860> it'll<00:01:56.100> move

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
it'll do a couple of things it'll move

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.270 
it'll do a couple of things it'll move
it<00:01:56.640> away<00:01:56.729> from<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:57.149> plug<00:01:57.560> it'll<00:01:58.560> make<00:01:58.740> this

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
it away from that plug it'll make this

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.969 
it away from that plug it'll make this
part<00:01:59.700> I<00:02:00.149> got<00:02:00.719> room<00:02:00.960> anyway<00:02:01.259> so<00:02:01.320> as<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.680> come<00:02:01.860> away

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
part I got room anyway so as I come away

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.999 
part I got room anyway so as I come away
from<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.460> it's<00:02:03.030> gonna<00:02:03.210> work<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.750> by<00:02:04.740> doing

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
from it it's gonna work and by doing

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.150 
from it it's gonna work and by doing
that<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:06.000> will<00:02:06.180> also<00:02:06.530> bring<00:02:07.530> this<00:02:07.740> one<00:02:07.920> closer

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
that it will also bring this one closer

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.130 
that it will also bring this one closer
well<00:02:08.399> that<00:02:08.550> will<00:02:08.700> work<00:02:08.849> so<00:02:09.599> it'll<00:02:09.810> make<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:09.929> lot

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
well that will work so it'll make a lot

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.210 
well that will work so it'll make a lot
easier<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.560> install<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:11.129> remove

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
easier to install and remove

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.190 
easier to install and remove
I<00:02:12.250> think<00:02:13.180> they<00:02:13.270> just<00:02:13.300> changed<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:13.840> frame<00:02:14.080> on

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
I think they just changed the frame on

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.330 
I think they just changed the frame on
the<00:02:14.290> 2012<00:02:15.990> commander<00:02:16.990> so<00:02:17.500> I'm<00:02:17.800> just<00:02:18.190> gonna

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
the 2012 commander so I'm just gonna

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.780 
the 2012 commander so I'm just gonna
make<00:02:18.520> a<00:02:18.580> few<00:02:18.790> modifications<00:02:18.940> but<00:02:19.710> maybe<00:02:20.790> we'll

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
make a few modifications but maybe we'll

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.440 
make a few modifications but maybe we'll
see<00:02:21.970> if<00:02:22.060> that<00:02:22.090> part<00:02:22.450> can<00:02:22.570> get<00:02:22.690> changed<00:02:23.110> for<00:02:23.320> him
