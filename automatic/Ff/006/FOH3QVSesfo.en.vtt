00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.300 

okay<00:00:03.210> I'm<00:00:03.419> going<00:00:03.570> to<00:00:03.659> do<00:00:03.780> another<00:00:04.020> test<00:00:04.470> of<00:00:04.859> a

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
okay I'm going to do another test of a

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.040 
okay I'm going to do another test of a
firebox<00:00:05.910> in<00:00:06.390> its<00:00:08.030> inverted<00:00:09.030> position<00:00:09.809> I

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
firebox in its inverted position I

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.860 
firebox in its inverted position I
tested<00:00:10.740> this<00:00:12.139> with<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.380> boiler<00:00:13.830> plate<00:00:14.870> and

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
tested this with the boiler plate and

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.420 
tested this with the boiler plate and
I've<00:00:16.139> done<00:00:16.350> a<00:00:16.379> little<00:00:16.650> bit<00:00:16.770> of<00:00:16.830> water<00:00:17.100> boiling

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
I've done a little bit of water boiling

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.529 
I've done a little bit of water boiling
with<00:00:17.820> it<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.170> temperature<00:00:19.680> isn't<00:00:20.539> hot

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
with it and the temperature isn't hot

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.320 
with it and the temperature isn't hot
enough<00:00:21.900> for<00:00:22.170> me<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:22.590> think<00:00:22.619> that<00:00:23.070> it's

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
enough for me to think that it's

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.750 
enough for me to think that it's
efficient<00:00:24.330> for<00:00:24.420> boiling<00:00:24.960> water<00:00:25.400> but<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:26.460> think

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
efficient for boiling water but I think

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.679 
efficient for boiling water but I think
it<00:00:26.849> might<00:00:27.029> be<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.210> great<00:00:27.539> position<00:00:27.779> for<00:00:28.609> cooking

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
it might be a great position for cooking

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.700 
it might be a great position for cooking
so<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:31.050> want<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:31.980> go<00:00:32.130> ahead<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.369> try<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:32.759> out<00:00:33.000> for

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
so I want to go ahead and try it out for

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.049 
so I want to go ahead and try it out for
cooking<00:00:34.710> so<00:00:35.010> I'm<00:00:35.100> going<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.280> take<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.640> boiler

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
cooking so I'm going to take the boiler

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.580 
cooking so I'm going to take the boiler
plate<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:37.320> slide<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.040> ash<00:00:38.160> pan<00:00:38.520> over<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.590> okay

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
plate you slide the ash pan over it okay

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.619 
plate you slide the ash pan over it okay
and<00:00:40.829> then<00:00:41.010> we'll<00:00:41.250> put<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.579> into<00:00:41.879> this<00:00:42.030> position

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
and then we'll put it into this position

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:49.340 
and then we'll put it into this position
here<00:00:46.910> and<00:00:47.910> now<00:00:48.090> that's<00:00:48.329> locked<00:00:48.660> in<00:00:48.870> there<00:00:49.079> so

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
here and now that's locked in there so

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.840 
here and now that's locked in there so
you<00:00:49.410> could<00:00:49.649> use<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.309> make<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.489> grilled

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
you could use that to make a grilled

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.299 
you could use that to make a grilled
cheese<00:00:51.149> sandwich<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:52.050> little<00:00:52.140> griddle<00:00:53.070> top

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
cheese sandwich a little griddle top

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.270 
cheese sandwich a little griddle top
there<00:00:54.469> but<00:00:55.469> what<00:00:55.620> I'm<00:00:55.710> gonna<00:00:55.829> do<00:00:56.010> with<00:00:56.160> it

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
there but what I'm gonna do with it

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.220 
there but what I'm gonna do with it
today<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.850> that's<00:00:57.120> going<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.510> hold<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.020> whole

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
today is that's going to hold the whole

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.939 
today is that's going to hold the whole
firebox<00:00:58.800> in<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.250> this<00:00:59.370> position<00:01:00.320> so<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:01.350> the

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
firebox in to this position so that the

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:08.390 
firebox in to this position so that the
fire<00:01:02.579> grate<00:01:03.000> itself<00:01:04.339> can<00:01:05.339> go<00:01:05.580> down<00:01:06.979> and<00:01:07.979> then

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
fire grate itself can go down and then

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.160 
fire grate itself can go down and then
what<00:01:08.580> I'll<00:01:08.700> do<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:09.180> have<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.510> sitting<00:01:09.750> up<00:01:09.960> on

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
what I'll do is I have it sitting up on

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.469 
what I'll do is I have it sitting up on
this<00:01:10.380> block<00:01:10.830> so<00:01:11.460> if<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:11.760> were<00:01:11.880> in<00:01:12.060> nature

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
this block so if you were in nature

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.840 
this block so if you were in nature
you'd<00:01:13.110> need<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.409> find<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.830> rock<00:01:14.070> or<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.430> kind<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.760> a

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
you'd need to find a rock or a kind of a

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.390 
you'd need to find a rock or a kind of a
ledge<00:01:15.090> or<00:01:15.420> something<00:01:15.869> because<00:01:16.770> when<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.159> feed

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
ledge or something because when you feed

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.060 
ledge or something because when you feed
this<00:01:17.640> wood<00:01:17.909> in<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.270> side<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:19.229> needs<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.650> go<00:01:19.799> up

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
this wood in the side it needs to go up

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.700 
this wood in the side it needs to go up
in<00:01:20.340> at<00:01:20.610> just<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:21.060> little<00:01:21.090> bit<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.509> an<00:01:21.600> angle<00:01:21.780> if

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
in at just a little bit of an angle if

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.219 
in at just a little bit of an angle if
it<00:01:22.830> goes<00:01:22.979> up<00:01:23.189> in<00:01:23.369> at<00:01:23.549> an<00:01:23.670> angle<00:01:24.119> then<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.869> open

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
it goes up in at an angle then you open

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.929 
it goes up in at an angle then you open
up<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.470> wind<00:01:25.680> damper<00:01:26.100> in<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.340> back<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.909> that

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
up the wind damper in the back and that

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.539 
up the wind damper in the back and that
allows<00:01:27.689> air<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.110> flow<00:01:28.560> in<00:01:29.009> directly

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
allows air to flow in directly

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.550 
allows air to flow in directly
underneath<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.210> fire<00:01:30.659> they're<00:01:31.110> gonna<00:01:31.409> use

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
underneath the fire they're gonna use

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.109 
underneath the fire they're gonna use
some<00:01:31.740> paper<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.189> get<00:01:32.340> this<00:01:32.520> going<00:01:32.880> in<00:01:33.030> the

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
some paper to get this going in the

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.300 
some paper to get this going in the
interest<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.600> time<00:01:34.670> in<00:01:35.670> all<00:01:35.850> fairness<00:01:37.280> when<00:01:38.280> I

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
interest of time in all fairness when I

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.249 
interest of time in all fairness when I
collected<00:01:38.850> these<00:01:39.000> sticks<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.659> did<00:01:39.930> have<00:01:40.110> to

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
collected these sticks I did have to

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.910 
collected these sticks I did have to
spend<00:01:40.530> some<00:01:40.650> time<00:01:42.170> finding<00:01:43.170> nice<00:01:43.560> straight

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
spend some time finding nice straight

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.240 
spend some time finding nice straight
ones<00:01:44.780> kind<00:01:45.780> of<00:01:45.869> grooming<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.560> gnarly

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
ones kind of grooming the gnarly

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.770 
ones kind of grooming the gnarly
branches<00:01:47.790> off<00:01:48.829> because<00:01:50.210> I'm<00:01:51.210> out<00:01:51.420> here<00:01:51.630> with

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
branches off because I'm out here with

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.289 
branches off because I'm out here with
sagebrush<00:01:52.500> mostly<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.430> sagebrush<00:01:54.000> and

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
sagebrush mostly and sagebrush and

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.340 
sagebrush mostly and sagebrush and
juniper<00:01:56.210> there's<00:01:57.210> not<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.420> lot<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.780> straight

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
juniper there's not a lot of straight

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.959 
juniper there's not a lot of straight
sticks<00:01:59.189> when<00:01:59.520> you're<00:01:59.640> working<00:01:59.939> with

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
sticks when you're working with

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.600 
sticks when you're working with
sagebrush<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.810> juniper<00:02:02.240> so<00:02:04.189> they<00:02:05.189> have<00:02:05.369> this

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
sagebrush and juniper so they have this

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.410 
sagebrush and juniper so they have this
is<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:06.090> piece<00:02:06.329> of<00:02:06.360> a

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
is a piece of a

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:14.460 
is a piece of a
phantes<00:02:08.310> so<00:02:09.310> it's<00:02:09.459> nice<00:02:09.729> and<00:02:10.000> straight<00:02:13.470> I'll

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
phantes so it's nice and straight I'll

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.260 
phantes so it's nice and straight I'll
go<00:02:14.620> ahead<00:02:14.709> and<00:02:14.950> start<00:02:15.190> some<00:02:15.459> of<00:02:15.610> these<00:02:15.700> pieces

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
go ahead and start some of these pieces

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.860 
go ahead and start some of these pieces
in<00:02:16.480> here<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:18.430> I<00:02:18.730> think<00:02:18.790> you<00:02:19.150> kind<00:02:19.360> of<00:02:19.450> want<00:02:19.690> the

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
in here and I think you kind of want the

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.680 
in here and I think you kind of want the
same<00:02:20.140> sized<00:02:20.530> pieces<00:02:21.250> as<00:02:21.819> what<00:02:22.150> you<00:02:22.300> would<00:02:22.510> want

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
same sized pieces as what you would want

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.740 
same sized pieces as what you would want
if<00:02:23.620> you<00:02:23.739> were<00:02:23.860> using<00:02:24.069> the<00:02:24.340> fire<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:25.239> fire<00:02:25.270> box

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
if you were using the fire the fire box

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.680 
if you were using the fire the fire box
in<00:02:25.989> its<00:02:27.959> in<00:02:28.959> its<00:02:29.350> traditional<00:02:29.980> position<00:02:30.940> in

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
in its in its traditional position in

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.949 
in its in its traditional position in
its<00:02:31.900> upright<00:02:32.200> position<00:02:33.420> about<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:34.480> size<00:02:34.810> of

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
its upright position about the size of

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.690 
its upright position about the size of
your<00:02:35.050> finger<00:02:35.470> I<00:02:35.500> think<00:02:35.650> is<00:02:36.010> probably<00:02:36.220> going<00:02:36.519> to

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
your finger I think is probably going to

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.390 
your finger I think is probably going to
be<00:02:36.760> about<00:02:36.940> best<00:02:40.709> go<00:02:41.709> ahead<00:02:41.920> and<00:02:42.040> get<00:02:42.190> these

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
be about best go ahead and get these

00:02:42.400 --> 00:03:26.310 
be about best go ahead and get these
sticks

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:40.390 

you<00:03:27.320> go<00:03:27.470> ahead<00:03:27.590> and<00:03:27.800> give<00:03:27.920> it<00:03:27.950> a<00:03:28.100> try<00:03:28.400> here<00:03:39.400> wow

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
you go ahead and give it a try here wow

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.010 
you go ahead and give it a try here wow
that<00:03:40.730> actually<00:03:40.760> looks<00:03:41.180> like<00:03:41.510> it<00:03:41.660> might<00:03:41.870> be<00:03:41.900> a

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:42.020 
that actually looks like it might be a

00:03:42.020 --> 00:04:27.680 
that actually looks like it might be a
pretty<00:03:42.740> great<00:03:43.100> temperature<00:03:43.550> for<00:03:43.820> cooking

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:33.469 

get<00:04:28.690> that<00:04:28.870> see<00:04:29.110> you<00:04:29.229> see<00:04:29.470> a<00:04:29.500> little<00:04:29.740> bit<00:04:29.919> better

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:39.719 

it's<00:04:34.479> actually<00:04:34.840> cooking<00:04:35.169> very<00:04:35.380> nicely<00:04:38.729> and

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:39.729 
it's actually cooking very nicely and

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:41.310 
it's actually cooking very nicely and
wiggle<00:04:40.120> these<00:04:40.240> sticks<00:04:40.690> in<00:04:40.930> just<00:04:41.139> a<00:04:41.289> little

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
wiggle these sticks in just a little

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.909 
wiggle these sticks in just a little
further

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:50.159 

maintain<00:04:44.919> our<00:04:45.100> fire<00:04:45.370> a<00:04:48.990> couple<00:04:49.990> of<00:04:50.050> these

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
maintain our fire a couple of these

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.189 
maintain our fire a couple of these
sticks<00:04:50.470> are<00:04:50.590> pretty<00:04:50.830> big<00:04:51.509> and<00:04:52.509> a<00:04:52.720> few<00:04:52.900> of<00:04:53.020> them

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 
sticks are pretty big and a few of them

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:54.900 
sticks are pretty big and a few of them
are<00:04:53.289> kind<00:04:53.470> of<00:04:53.500> smaller<00:04:53.860> so<00:04:54.370> I<00:04:54.400> guess<00:04:54.699> you'd

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
are kind of smaller so I guess you'd

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.570 
are kind of smaller so I guess you'd
kind<00:04:55.150> of<00:04:55.210> learn<00:04:55.419> what<00:04:55.750> size<00:04:56.710> sticks<00:04:57.160> are<00:04:57.460> gonna

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
kind of learn what size sticks are gonna

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.140 
kind of learn what size sticks are gonna
produce<00:04:58.229> what<00:04:59.229> kind<00:04:59.470> of<00:04:59.530> temperature<00:05:00.130> on<00:05:00.850> the

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
produce what kind of temperature on the

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.659 
produce what kind of temperature on the
stove<00:05:01.650> and<00:05:02.650> probably<00:05:03.039> a<00:05:03.070> smaller<00:05:03.400> diameter

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
stove and probably a smaller diameter

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:12.719 
stove and probably a smaller diameter
sticks<00:05:04.389> are<00:05:04.600> gonna<00:05:06.270> fire<00:05:11.220> but<00:05:12.220> I've<00:05:12.310> got<00:05:12.550> the

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:12.729 
sticks are gonna fire but I've got the

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:16.320 
sticks are gonna fire but I've got the
wind<00:05:12.970> going<00:05:13.630> in<00:05:13.949> to<00:05:14.949> this<00:05:15.190> backside<00:05:15.850> so<00:05:16.180> it's

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
wind going in to this backside so it's

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.490 
wind going in to this backside so it's
going<00:05:16.479> into<00:05:16.870> the<00:05:17.139> damper<00:05:17.680> and<00:05:18.150> I<00:05:19.349> think<00:05:20.349> that's

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
going into the damper and I think that's

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.800 
going into the damper and I think that's
how<00:05:20.680> you'd<00:05:20.889> want<00:05:21.190> to<00:05:21.250> orient<00:05:21.669> it<00:05:21.880> as<00:05:22.389> far<00:05:22.690> as

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
how you'd want to orient it as far as

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:34.189 
how you'd want to orient it as far as
the<00:05:22.960> breeze<00:05:23.199> goes

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:48.500 

and<00:05:34.289> then<00:05:34.499> get<00:05:34.770> these<00:05:34.979> over

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:59.120 

I<00:05:56.690> got<00:05:57.690> that<00:05:57.870> turned<00:05:58.110> over<00:05:58.410> without<00:05:58.680> breaking

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130 
I got that turned over without breaking

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:03.590 
I got that turned over without breaking
it<00:05:59.280> and<00:06:01.610> I'll<00:06:02.610> go<00:06:02.730> ahead<00:06:02.910> and<00:06:03.000> take<00:06:03.210> off<00:06:03.390> this

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 
it and I'll go ahead and take off this

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.080 
it and I'll go ahead and take off this
camera<00:06:03.990> and<00:06:04.290> kind<00:06:05.160> of<00:06:05.310> give<00:06:05.520> you<00:06:05.640> the<00:06:05.700> view

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
camera and kind of give you the view

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:09.020 
camera and kind of give you the view
today<00:06:07.040> I'm<00:06:08.040> gonna<00:06:08.130> go<00:06:08.340> ahead<00:06:08.400> and<00:06:08.580> open<00:06:08.670> that

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030 
today I'm gonna go ahead and open that

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:10.550 
today I'm gonna go ahead and open that
up<00:06:09.090> that<00:06:09.420> might<00:06:09.600> be<00:06:09.750> a<00:06:09.780> good<00:06:09.930> way<00:06:10.110> to<00:06:10.170> control

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 
up that might be a good way to control

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.530 
up that might be a good way to control
the<00:06:10.770> temperature<00:06:11.100> as<00:06:11.430> well<00:06:11.670> by<00:06:11.970> using<00:06:12.180> that

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:12.540 
the temperature as well by using that

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:33.440 
the temperature as well by using that
wind<00:06:12.780> damper<00:06:31.340> you<00:06:32.340> can<00:06:32.520> see<00:06:32.640> down<00:06:32.850> there<00:06:33.090> just

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:33.450 
wind damper you can see down there just

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:43.310 
wind damper you can see down there just
a<00:06:33.600> nice<00:06:33.840> little<00:06:34.050> efficient<00:06:34.590> fire<00:06:41.480> and<00:06:42.480> this

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:43.320 
a nice little efficient fire and this

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.360 
a nice little efficient fire and this
does<00:06:43.590> use<00:06:43.890> less<00:06:44.370> fuel<00:06:44.700> than<00:06:45.210> the<00:06:45.510> traditional

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:46.370 
does use less fuel than the traditional

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:52.550 
does use less fuel than the traditional
setup<00:06:47.370> for<00:06:47.700> the<00:06:47.760> firebox<00:06:50.570> but<00:06:51.570> your<00:06:51.810> fire<00:06:52.320> is

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 
setup for the firebox but your fire is

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.840 
setup for the firebox but your fire is
limited<00:06:53.160> on<00:06:53.370> how<00:06:54.300> hot<00:06:54.570> you<00:06:54.780> can<00:06:54.960> get<00:06:55.170> it<00:06:55.850> and

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:56.850 
limited on how hot you can get it and

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:58.880 
limited on how hot you can get it and
you<00:06:57.090> can't<00:06:57.330> produce<00:06:57.540> hot<00:06:57.900> coals<00:06:58.260> this<00:06:58.650> way

00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:58.890 
you can't produce hot coals this way

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:02.270 
you can't produce hot coals this way
either<00:07:00.260> yeah<00:07:01.260> so<00:07:01.590> you<00:07:01.650> can<00:07:01.830> see<00:07:01.860> there's

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:02.280 
either yeah so you can see there's

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:07.970 
either yeah so you can see there's
plenty<00:07:02.340> of<00:07:02.730> heat<00:07:02.910> there<00:07:03.300> to<00:07:04.220> cook<00:07:05.220> an<00:07:05.400> egg<00:07:06.980> and

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:07.980 
plenty of heat there to cook an egg and

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:09.800 
plenty of heat there to cook an egg and
I<00:07:08.400> just<00:07:08.670> got<00:07:08.880> a<00:07:08.910> little<00:07:09.090> bit<00:07:09.330> carried<00:07:09.630> away

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:09.810 
I just got a little bit carried away

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.840 
I just got a little bit carried away
with<00:07:10.170> the<00:07:10.320> heat<00:07:10.530> and<00:07:11.130> didn't<00:07:11.430> watch<00:07:11.610> this

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:11.850 
with the heat and didn't watch this

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:14.930 
with the heat and didn't watch this
quite<00:07:12.090> close<00:07:12.390> enough<00:07:12.740> got<00:07:13.740> a<00:07:13.860> little<00:07:14.250> bit<00:07:14.400> too

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:14.940 
quite close enough got a little bit too

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.060 
quite close enough got a little bit too
dark<00:07:15.270> there<00:07:15.540> I<00:07:15.810> would<00:07:16.110> try<00:07:16.320> again<00:07:16.620> but<00:07:16.800> I'm<00:07:16.920> out

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:17.070 
dark there I would try again but I'm out

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:20.060 
dark there I would try again but I'm out
of<00:07:17.100> eggs<00:07:17.900> but<00:07:18.900> I'm<00:07:19.020> still<00:07:19.290> gonna<00:07:19.350> eat<00:07:19.620> this<00:07:19.800> one

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:20.070 
of eggs but I'm still gonna eat this one

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:23.210 
of eggs but I'm still gonna eat this one
that<00:07:21.000> looks<00:07:21.030> good<00:07:21.590> well<00:07:22.590> that's<00:07:22.800> kind<00:07:23.040> of<00:07:23.070> how

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:23.220 
that looks good well that's kind of how
