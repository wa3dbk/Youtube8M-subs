mount meant for biking or some

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.179 
mount meant for biking or some
motorcycles<00:01:13.260> although<00:01:13.500> we<00:01:13.619> found<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.040> was<00:01:14.159> a

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
motorcycles although we found that was a

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.590 
motorcycles although we found that was a
little<00:01:14.310> hard<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.729> fit<00:01:14.970> on<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.180> normal

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
little hard to fit on a normal

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.179 
little hard to fit on a normal
motorcycle<00:01:16.290> but<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.530> did<00:01:16.680> work<00:01:16.830> pretty<00:01:17.100> well

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
motorcycle but it did work pretty well

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.399 
motorcycle but it did work pretty well
on<00:01:17.520> bike<00:01:17.759> handles<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.509> so<00:01:18.990> you've<00:01:19.170> got<00:01:19.200> a

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
on bike handles and so you've got a

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.950 
on bike handles and so you've got a
decent<00:01:19.740> waterproof<00:01:20.369> case<00:01:20.610> included<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.330> like

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
decent waterproof case included I like

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.230 
decent waterproof case included I like
the<00:01:22.200> fact<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.100> double<00:01:23.430> latch<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.119> it

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
the fact that it is a double latch so it

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.359 
the fact that it is a double latch so it
doesn't<00:01:24.540> just<00:01:24.689> pop<00:01:24.990> open<00:01:25.350> yeah<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:25.920> had<00:01:26.220> that

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
doesn't just pop open yeah I had that

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.010 
doesn't just pop open yeah I had that
problem<00:01:26.640> on<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:26.909> contour<00:01:27.479> it<00:01:27.570> was<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.689> little<00:01:27.810> too

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
problem on a contour it was a little too

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.929

easy<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.439> open<00:01:28.650> up<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:28.979> contour<00:01:29.369> case<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.850> it

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
easy to open up the contour case and it

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.789 
easy to open up the contour case and it
got<00:01:30.060> water<00:01:30.329> in<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.689> damaged<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.229> but<00:01:31.350> you

while you release that and then it opens
up<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.500> flips<00:01:38.040> up<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.460> it's<00:01:38.700> tethered

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
up and flips up and it's tethered

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.399 
up and flips up and it's tethered
together<00:01:39.299> there<00:01:39.720> so<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.020> don't<00:01:40.170> lose<00:01:40.380> that

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
together there so you don't lose that

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.069 
together there so you don't lose that
piece<00:01:40.860> so<00:01:41.009> it's<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.250> pretty<00:01:41.490> solid<00:01:42.079> waterproof

as well as a USB port and an hdmi port

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.930 
as well as a USB port and an hdmi port
now<00:02:40.260> we'll<00:02:40.470> talk<00:02:40.650> more<00:02:40.860> about<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.340> placement

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
now we'll talk more about the placement

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.309 
now we'll talk more about the placement
of<00:02:42.000> those<00:02:42.120> ports<00:02:42.510> later<00:02:42.720> it<00:02:42.900> seems<00:02:43.140> like<00:02:43.290> a

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
of those ports later it seems like a

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:44.930 
of those ports later it seems like a
weird<00:02:43.620> thing<00:02:43.950> to<00:02:44.010> put<00:02:44.280> them<00:02:44.370> on<00:02:44.489> the<00:02:44.580> bottom

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
weird thing to put them on the bottom

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.420 
weird thing to put them on the bottom
and<00:02:45.090> attach<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.750> camera<00:02:45.930> but<00:02:46.380> when<00:02:46.980> it's<00:02:47.130> in<00:02:47.340> a

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
and attach the camera but when it's in a

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.910 
and attach the camera but when it's in a
case<00:02:47.670> it<00:02:48.060> is<00:02:48.600> pretty<00:02:48.870> solid<00:02:49.140> which<00:02:49.560> is<00:02:49.739> nice

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
case it is pretty solid which is nice

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.460 
case it is pretty solid which is nice
we'll<00:02:50.220> just<00:02:50.430> slip<00:02:50.850> that<00:02:51.030> in<00:02:51.090> there<00:02:51.239> and<00:02:51.840> this

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
we'll just slip that in there and this

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.180 
we'll just slip that in there and this
reminds<00:02:53.160> me<00:02:53.340> a<00:02:53.610> lot<00:02:54.150> of<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:55.110> contour<00:02:55.739> cameras

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
reminds me a lot of the contour cameras

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.039 
reminds me a lot of the contour cameras
which<00:02:56.370> I<00:02:56.519> was<00:02:56.790> a<00:02:56.819> big<00:02:57.090> fan<00:02:57.120> of<00:02:57.390> they<00:02:57.690> were<00:02:57.750> an

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
which I was a big fan of they were an

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.050 
which I was a big fan of they were an
early<00:02:58.260> competitor<00:02:58.890> to<00:02:58.980> go<00:02:59.100> pro<00:02:59.340> all<00:02:59.700> the

early competitor to go pro all the
controls<00:03:00.480> are<00:03:00.750> right<00:03:00.930> here<00:03:01.200> on<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.380> back<00:03:01.560> so

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
controls are right here on the back so

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.890 
controls are right here on the back so
you<00:03:02.250> got<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.580> ability<00:03:02.819> to<00:03:03.180> start<00:03:03.600> and<00:03:03.750> stop

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
you got the ability to start and stop

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.020 
you got the ability to start and stop
the<00:03:04.080> camera<00:03:04.410> as<00:03:04.590> well<00:03:04.620> as<00:03:04.980> lock<00:03:05.459> it<00:03:05.730> so<00:03:05.760> it

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
the camera as well as lock it so it

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.240 
the camera as well as lock it so it
doesn't<00:03:06.060> stop<00:03:06.630> recording<00:03:07.019> which<00:03:07.799> is<00:03:07.980> great

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
doesn't stop recording which is great

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.430 
doesn't stop recording which is great
for<00:03:08.280> things<00:03:08.730> like<00:03:08.819> diving<00:03:09.269> so<00:03:09.660> you<00:03:09.720> know<00:03:10.110> that

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
for things like diving so you know that

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.920 
for things like diving so you know that
this<00:03:10.560> is<00:03:10.769> rolling<00:03:11.239> optically<00:03:12.239> pretty<00:03:12.750> much

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
this is rolling optically pretty much

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.199 
this is rolling optically pretty much
what<00:03:13.110> you'd<00:03:13.230> expect<00:03:13.319> it's<00:03:13.950> a<00:03:14.069> 2.8<00:03:14.640> lens<00:03:14.819> that's

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
what you'd expect it's a 2.8 lens that's

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.699 
what you'd expect it's a 2.8 lens that's
really<00:03:15.480> in<00:03:15.569> line<00:03:15.780> with<00:03:16.019> most<00:03:16.319> of<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.500> other

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
really in line with most of the other

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.710 
really in line with most of the other
action<00:03:17.130> cameras<00:03:17.489> and<00:03:17.730> you<00:03:17.850> need<00:03:18.000> about<00:03:18.150> a<00:03:18.269> foot

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
action cameras and you need about a foot

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.990 
action cameras and you need about a foot
as<00:03:18.900> a<00:03:18.959> minimum<00:03:19.680> focus<00:03:20.190> distance<00:03:20.220> so<00:03:20.760> you're

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
as a minimum focus distance so you're

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.910 
as a minimum focus distance so you're
not<00:03:21.150> going<00:03:21.329> to<00:03:21.420> be<00:03:21.540> chasing<00:03:22.380> things<00:03:22.560> right

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
not going to be chasing things right

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.979 
not going to be chasing things right
there<00:03:23.220> on<00:03:23.489> the<00:03:23.519> tabletop<00:03:23.970> or<00:03:24.420> shooting<00:03:24.780> bugs

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
there on the tabletop or shooting bugs

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.050 
there on the tabletop or shooting bugs
with<00:03:25.230> this<00:03:25.380> thing<00:03:25.560> is<00:03:25.709> not<00:03:26.010> a<00:03:26.070> science<00:03:26.670> camera

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
with this thing is not a science camera

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.970 
with this thing is not a science camera
means<00:03:27.510> it's<00:03:27.750> an<00:03:27.900> action<00:03:28.380> camera<00:03:28.590> and

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
means it's an action camera and

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.310 
means it's an action camera and
everything<00:03:29.910> looks<00:03:30.120> good<00:03:30.359> from<00:03:30.570> about<00:03:30.900> a<00:03:30.930> foot

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
everything looks good from about a foot

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.190 
everything looks good from about a foot
to<00:03:31.890> infinitely<00:03:32.549> far<00:03:32.850> away<00:03:32.910> you<00:03:33.750> can't<00:03:34.019> really

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
to infinitely far away you can't really

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.750 
to infinitely far away you can't really
tweak<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.650> focus<00:03:34.980> or<00:03:35.130> anything<00:03:35.370> else<00:03:35.519> it's

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
tweak the focus or anything else it's

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.310 
tweak the focus or anything else it's
pretty<00:03:36.030> straightforward<00:03:36.329> the<00:03:36.720> shutter<00:03:36.989> speed

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
pretty straightforward the shutter speed

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.530 
pretty straightforward the shutter speed
will<00:03:37.560> dynamically<00:03:38.400> adjust<00:03:38.880> based<00:03:39.209> on<00:03:39.420> the

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
will dynamically adjust based on the

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.599 
will dynamically adjust based on the
lighting<00:03:39.840> in<00:03:39.930> the<00:03:39.989> scene<00:03:40.019> so<00:03:40.829> it's<00:03:41.250> basically

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
lighting in the scene so it's basically

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:44.630 
lighting in the scene so it's basically
an<00:03:42.120> action<00:03:42.840> camera<00:03:42.989> Sony's<00:03:43.739> version<00:03:44.160> of<00:03:44.340> an

going to have those higher frame rates

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.809 
going to have those higher frame rates
you<00:03:56.819> do<00:03:57.000> need<00:03:57.150> to<00:03:57.269> step<00:03:57.600> down<00:03:57.900> to<00:03:58.680> 720<00:03:59.430> to<00:03:59.640> get

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
you do need to step down to 720 to get

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.509 
you do need to step down to 720 to get
you<00:03:59.970> know<00:04:00.060> 720p<00:04:00.720> 60<00:04:01.230> and<00:04:01.440> higher<00:04:01.980> frame<00:04:02.310> rates

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
you know 720p 60 and higher frame rates

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.400 
you know 720p 60 and higher frame rates
which<00:04:03.150> is<00:04:03.299> sort<00:04:03.540> of<00:04:03.569> on<00:04:03.720> par<00:04:03.959> at<00:04:04.109> this<00:04:04.230> price

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
which is sort of on par at this price

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.559 
which is sort of on par at this price
point<00:04:04.470> on<00:04:04.859> par<00:04:05.069> with<00:04:05.100> with<00:04:05.940> similar<00:04:06.239> cameras

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
point on par with with similar cameras

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.120 
point on par with with similar cameras
now<00:04:06.750> which<00:04:07.140> there<00:04:07.319> is<00:04:07.410> one<00:04:07.590> other<00:04:07.620> additional

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
now which there is one other additional

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.680 
now which there is one other additional
thing<00:04:08.280> that<00:04:08.370> I<00:04:08.430> do<00:04:08.489> like<00:04:08.819> versus<00:04:09.420> some<00:04:09.540> of<00:04:09.569> the

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
thing that I do like versus some of the

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:10.910 
thing that I do like versus some of the
other<00:04:09.810> action<00:04:10.170> cameras<00:04:10.440> that<00:04:10.560> we've<00:04:10.650> taken<00:04:10.829> a

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
other action cameras that we've taken a

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.770 
other action cameras that we've taken a
look<00:04:10.950> at<00:04:11.130> it<00:04:11.340> seems<00:04:11.850> like<00:04:12.030> Sony's<00:04:12.389> put<00:04:12.600> a<00:04:12.630> lot

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
look at it seems like Sony's put a lot

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.030 
look at it seems like Sony's put a lot
of<00:04:12.810> thought<00:04:13.019> or<00:04:13.049> sort<00:04:13.530> of<00:04:13.590> you<00:04:13.739> know<00:04:13.799> I<00:04:13.889> at

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
of thought or sort of you know I at

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.949 
of thought or sort of you know I at
least<00:04:14.160> sort<00:04:14.970> of<00:04:15.030> at<00:04:15.120> launch<00:04:15.329> and<00:04:15.540> sort<00:04:15.900> of

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
least sort of at launch and sort of

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.719 
least sort of at launch and sort of
release<00:04:16.169> of<00:04:16.350> this<00:04:16.470> with<00:04:17.010> some<00:04:17.190> accessories

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
release of this with some accessories

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.610 
release of this with some accessories
yeah<00:04:18.060> and<00:04:18.600> that's<00:04:19.109> more<00:04:19.289> than<00:04:19.380> I<00:04:19.440> can<00:04:19.530> say

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
yeah and that's more than I can say

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.020 
yeah and that's more than I can say
about<00:04:19.769> some<00:04:20.130> of<00:04:20.190> the<00:04:20.250> other<00:04:20.370> action<00:04:20.789> cameras

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
about some of the other action cameras

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.000 
about some of the other action cameras
that<00:04:21.150> we<00:04:21.239> looked<00:04:21.419> at<00:04:21.539> so<00:04:22.380> they<00:04:22.530> have<00:04:22.680> a<00:04:22.710> couple

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
that we looked at so they have a couple

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.399 
that we looked at so they have a couple
different<00:04:23.340> sort<00:04:23.789> of<00:04:23.880> head<00:04:24.419> mounted<00:04:24.840> straps

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:25.409 
different sort of head mounted straps

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:27.410 
different sort of head mounted straps
here<00:04:25.590> and<00:04:26.070> again<00:04:26.310> just<00:04:26.610> like<00:04:26.789> we<00:04:26.970> saw

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
here and again just like we saw

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.600 
here and again just like we saw
for<00:04:27.540> nice<00:04:28.020> strong<00:04:28.350> class<00:04:28.710> that<00:04:29.040> goes<00:04:29.190> in<00:04:29.400> there

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
for nice strong class that goes in there

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.310 
for nice strong class that goes in there
nice<00:04:30.120> adjustability<00:04:30.660> there<00:04:30.900> as<00:04:31.170> well
